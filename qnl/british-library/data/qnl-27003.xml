Hawker, whose contract has come to an end. 2, On political grounds Mr. Eden earnestly hopes that the Air Council will find it possible to comply with the Iianian Government’s request and he would be grateful to receive a reply at as early a date as possible. an a( ^ ( ^ that a note on Mr. Walker’s appointment in 1934 was enclosed in a semi-official letter from Mr. Rendel to Mr. Mallet, a copy of which was sent to Wing Commander Pirie under cover of Foreign Office letter Ro.E 6615/914/34 of the 5th November, 1934. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, bar Office and Department of Overseas Trade. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Secretary of the Air Ministryol British Legation, (« 1472/1472/34) ( No.73 i318/8/37 ) r, U NTIAL. Tehran, 27th February, 1937. Sir, I hfcve the honour to report that n parade of troops took place at the race-course at Jslaliyeh on the 23rd February, the anniversary of the coup d’etat of 1921. This year invitations were issued to the whole of the Diplora? tic corps, who were accommodated in e specially built stand of concrete, a great improvement on the tents oi previous years. 2. The following remarks on the parade are made up on the basis of the report submitted by ajor ybus, No.73/1936 of the 2Bth February 1936. I am indebted to the French ; ilitary attachd for some of the detailed information. 3. The parade was announced to start at 1.30 p.m. It was very well attended, end the staff arrangements for parking cars were much better th f &gt;n those of last year. Special invitations had been sent to the Tehran correspondents of Lnglish papers end newsagencies. The large race-course grsnd-stj nd was full of deputies of the majlis, government officials, and prominent members of the Iranian and Kuropern population of Tehran. Top-hats were the correct dress for the stands; and a remarkable number of this form of head-gear were seen, the most original exhibit being that of a deputy who hnd put on a black Homburg hat with the depression at the top pushed out. The bank of foreign Military Attaches w^ s strengthened by the presence of Colonel Hans Rohde, the newly-arrived German The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, .C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., k ilitary/ The Foreign &lt; ^*i c ®; ry Attach^ for Anf orv f \thenB, and Tehran. 4, The various units vere dr^wn up in *?ood tirae on the northern side of the race-course. The weather was not so cold as last ye^r, and flying conditions were satisfactory, with a light wind only. His Majesty arrived about 2 p.m. in the same venerable Rolls-Royce as last year. He was not accompanied by the i nhlevi ueen or by the two princesses. The only explanation whicn I have heard of their absence is that they were too busy preparing themselves for the two marriages which are due to take place in a few days. The Shah was however accomp nied by six of his sons, vis. the Vali-ahd and the five younger princes, All ' esn, Gholam i eza, Abdul Reza, Ahraen Reza, and kahmond Feza. All were dressed in khaki great-coats. His Majesty first rode up to the troops who were waiting on the north side of the race-course, and inspected them for about ten minutes. 5. The march-past of troops began shortly afterwards. The Rhah took the salutes from the same pavilion as last year, and appeared pleased with what he saw. He conversed occasionally with the Crown prince, and with the chief of the General otaff and the Acting Minister of iar. Aeroplanes began to fly over the saluting point soon after tne march-past started. The formation flying was not very good, the alignments being irregular. According to tne French ilitary Attach^ and other observers there were sixty-six-planes taking part. Actually however I believe, from a reliable source, that the correct number was fifty-two, a«de up as follows:- Tiger Moths Five flights of five machines - 25 Audsx and Fury - Four flights of five machines 20 Audax and Fury - One flight of seven machines Total 52 7 No stunting was attempted,The units marched pest in the following order:- (i) 30 troops of girl guides, the «ver*ge strength of eech troop being rbout 30} there could not, therefore, have bfen much more than 900 girl guides, though the loc 1 newspapers reported double that number. (ii) About 2, iOO boy Scouts# (iii) Students from the secondary schools, in their grey uniform suits and penfced cape; numbering about 2 , 000 . (iv) The cadets of the military school. Strength about the same as last year; 1. e. about 1,200. (v) Three platoons of tne Iranian Navy, average strength 60. The French military *ttecne has heard that they were all from the Caspian Division, but it is more probable that they were composed in the same way as last year; i.e. one platoon from the Caspian Division and the other two from the i ersian Gulf Division. (vi) Four platoons of the Iranian Air Force, each platoon consisting of four files of about 24 men each. (vii) Two battalions of engineers, one from the first »nd one from the second division. (viii) Bight regiments of infantry, four being from the first division and four from the second# ^ach regiment consisted of three battalions# (ix) Light artillery on heavy-draught Hungarian shire-horses, recently imported# The guns were 75 ra.ra. Before; one brigade from the first division end one from the second division; e*ch brigade consisting of 6 four-gun batteries8. (x) Field Artillery - twelve four-gun batteries of 8kode 1.06 m.m. guns. (xi) The cavalry school; about 140 riders. (xii) Four cavalry regiments* two from each division. Each regiment had eight Maxim machine-guns* of iwiss license, and four squadrons of swords* each squadron having eight light machine-guns. (xiii) Horse artillery. Three four-gun batteries of guns. There seems a great doubt what these guns really were; different authorities say they were Schneider guns, or Hussion guns of an old pettern, or Austrian guns of » recent pattern. (x1v’ Armoured cars. our old uolle—Hoyce pattern headed the parade. Then followed 19 Marmom four- wheelers. I am informed that 31 Harmon six-wheelers exist* but they did not appear at this parade. (xv) Tanks. Eleven heavy ton Czecho- orawska tanks each armed with 1-37 m.m. gun and 2 heavy macnine-guns were the main feature of this part of the parade. There were also 39 lighter tanks, of 3i tone, from the same factory, each armed with one heavy machine gun and one light machine-gun. These t^nks went by in three sections, each section consisting of 12 tanks and a separate one for the Commanding Officer. (xvi) Field Artillery, consisting of 12 - 105 m.m. guns drawn by the new Hungarian draught-horses. (xvii) Mectv nised anti-aircraft artillery, comprising 2 batteries of 76 m.ra. D.C. v. Bofors guns. There were no acrobatics or displays of trick- riding, gymnastics, etc. The mfirch-past finished at « bout 4.46 p.m, rnd the iihoh drove off in the Rolls-royce followed by his sons and hi a suite.8 Moat of trie remarks as to formation, turn-out, marching discipline, etc. m 1 de in the last report apply this year, except that the equipment of the troops seemed more uniform and newer; the boots of the men were either brand new or well polished and the rank and file looked cleaner. A noteworthy feature I of this parade was the new Hungarian horses; I hear that about 1,200 of these animals hove been imported into Iran, but that they are not standing the climate and altitude well; several have died, and the unfortun*te officers in charge have the unpleasant duty of reporting each casualty direct to the Shah. 1 9. I have been informed by Iranian friends that the 3hab, for the first time in the history of these parades, said that he w«s very pleased with it. It certainly seemed that every- thing hod been carefully arranged, and the only hitch thfct took place was the collapse of one unfortunate man in charge of a frisky mule; the animal galloped off, to be retrieved by another party of troops; the min picked himself up and went on, leaving his water-bottle to be kicked by the following troop. 10. Four Iraqi army officers attended the parade, n med as follows:- Colonel Bsha-un-din Nouri, Major akram Mushtaq, and 'i Captains Rafiq Aref and Laz^r. They were written up prominently in the loc *1 press, which stated that they were the guests of the Imperial Government for one week, having come on a visit of courtesy to porticipate in the Iranian national celebrations. They were entertained on the 24th February at a reception given in their honour by the chief of the General Staff at the Municipal Hotel; military attaches were invited, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was present. The Iraqi Minister remarked to me after the parade that he had heard that his government had been unable to obtain from the United Kingdom certain/certain guns *hich they had wished to buy there, «nd thflt whnt we had Just seen showed how essential it was that Ir&gt; qi armaments should be fcept fully up to date, i Those of my colleagues who h^ve witnessed previous parades all seem Impressed with the steady improvement which i being made by the Iranian army, fend by the improved physique and bet ring of the young civilians who take part in the day’s proceedings. The formation of an army of this kind in Iron is a most impressive feat: but the admiration which this feat s evokes must be qualified by the thought if the berthen of * taxation, almost too aeavy to be borne in this country, which it has involved, 11.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith a despatch covering an interesting and very informative report drawn up by the Military Attache attached to this Legation of the Military Review held annually on February 23rd. In accordance with the instruction in your telegram No. 37 of February 12th, the Review was attended by Major Pybus and by no other member of the Legation. 2. Colleagues have confirmed to me/$/lajor Pybus’ generally favourable view of the staff-work involved, and of the robust appearance of the Shah. On this occasion, in contrast to last year, His Imperial Majesty took notice of the Diplomatic Body to the extent of returning their salute. 3. Girl Guides appeared for the first time in this Review. Their inclusion was of course appropriate in connexion with the present campaign for the emancipation of women, the foundations of which are being laid in girls* schools and colleges.

I have the honour to forward herewith three copies of a report on the military review which was held on the 23rd of February at the Jelalieh parade ground on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the coup d’etat. 2. I have embodied the notes on organization and other technical matters in an appendix. Much of this information was given to me yesterday by the Minister of War at an interview for which I asked. After expressing my gratitude at being invited to witness the review, the regret of the remainder of the staff of the legation at being prevented from accepting the invitation owing to Court mourning and my admiration of the parade, I told His Excellency that, as this was the first time I had been privileged to come within a kilometre of the Iranian Army, I thought that the occasion called for a fuller report than I was able to render and asked His Excellency to be so good as to furnish me with sufficient detail to prevent me miscalling a battalion a regiment or confusing horse artillery with field. This kindly official then proceeded to give me the details as to organization, strengths and armament which I have set down in this report. 3. Copies have been sent to the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, The War Office; The Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, India, and to the General Staff Officer I Intelligence, Air Headquarters, Bagdad. I have etc. , G.D.Pybus Major, Military Attache. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, British Legation, Tehran.Invitations were issued for 1.30p.m. and by 1.0.p*m. crowds, estimated at 10,000, were lining the Eastern and Southern sides of the parade ground. The Eastern side was strongly held by a cordon of troops and a lane, a hundred yards in width, was kept open by which each unit, after completing the march past, left the ground by makeing a left wheel or left form on reaching the Southern end of the saluting base. The Southern side was but lightly held, the s. Kerej canal (at this point some 10 1 wide and li 1 deep) being deemed a sufficient barrier to encroachment from this flank. The car park was just behind this and here scenes of the greatest disorder prevailed. No sooner had some driver forcibly dislodged an enthusiast in hob-nailed boots from his near-side wing than he would find three more perched on his off-side bumper. The roof of one saloon car collapsed under the weight of eight intrepid sight-seers who had clambered thereon. This was hailed by all save the luckless owner as a highly diverting incident. Finally a posse of police was summoned to help the drivers in preventing their cars being used as public grandstands. They laid about them freely with their rubber truncheons and reduced the crowd to some semblance of order. The race-course grandstand and some tents were reserved for ticket holders consisting of government officials, Parliamentary deputies and prominent non-officials Iranian and European. Between the grandstand and the Shah f s pavilion an enclosure containing a tent was reserved for the Diplomatic Corps. Military Attaches were also accommodated in this enclosure which was adequate and from which an excellent view couldbe obtained. Though the clouds were low and there was no sun, it was not cold at 1.30p.m. By 3.0pm. however, a fresh North Westerly breeze had got up which increased in strength as the day wore on and by 4.0pm. it was bitterly cold and snow-storm could be seen raging on the Southern slopes of the Elburz some eight miles distant. The troops w’ere drawn up on two sides of a square, the civilian elements and the infantry facing South and the cavalry and artillery facing West. The limitations of space, the great strength of the parade and the desire to grant the spectators as close a view as possible had forced the general staff to adopt a very close, immobile and cumbersome formation. So crowded were the various units that in order to avoid confusion those on the inner flanks must have reached their alignments at least two hours before. The troops were wearing greatcoats but the lot of the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, clad in the flimsiest of twill, can hardly have been enviable. At 2.30pm. His Imperial Majesty The Shah arrived in a Rolls Royce limousine wdiich seemed to be of a 1922 vintage. A driver and footman sat in front but His Imperial Majesty was not accompanied by any A.D.C. or equerry. After alighting from his car His Imperial Majesty mounted his charger (a nice looking Turcoman-Arab crossbred grey 15-2 hands) and rode off to inspect the troops accompanied by the Acting Minister of War, the Chief of the General Staff and four principal staff officers. His Imperial Majesty only rode along the front rank of each side of the square. The troops /cheered/s, cheered. After this inspection, which lasted less than ten minutes, His Imperial Majesty rode hack to his pavilion, dismounted and, after a short interval, appeared on the balcony and turned towards the Diplomatic Corps and acknowledged the salutes of that body. He then retired inside the pavilion and emerged at 3.0pm. accompanied by the Queen and the two elder princesses (Shams Pahlevi, aged 18 and Ashraf Pahlevi, aged 16) His Imperial Majesty who appeared in excellent health and spirits, was, as always, dressed in uniform with a military great coat. The two princesses, who seemed entirely self-possessed? were very smartly turned out in well cut, dark green girl guided uniforms. Her Majesty was less happily garbed in 1 that type of ensemble indissolubly associated with the works of Mr. George Belcher. At six minutes past three fiftyfour aeroplanes (Hawker 'Audax 1 and 1 Tiger’ Moth) appeared from the East and flew Westward over the parade ground at right angles to the saluting base. They flew at an altitude of 1,000’ in eight flights, the first of five and the remainder of seven machines. The formation aimed at consisted of a double arrowhead of three machines each with the flight lieutenants machine as a pivot in the centre. Owing to the cloud and the rising wind, flying conditions may not have been good but the formation was ragged and it was very noticeable how most of the machines seemed to be rolling through an angle of almost 40? At a quarter past three fourteen more machines (’Moths’) flew over in two flights. The total number of machines on parade was /thereforetherefore, sixtyeight. In these there were no Hawker ’Furies’ as, on hearing of the crash of one of their number on the 22nd February while practising aerobatics for the parade, His Imperial Majesty had expressly forbidden their participation in the display, as also any form of ’’stunting”. After the aeroplanes had left, His Imperial Majesty was joined on the balcony by the Minister of Education. A military band took up a position facing the pavilion and about 100 yards distant from it and struck up a march. The march past then started. The order of units was as follows:- (i) 37 troops of Girl Guides. The average strength of a troop was 25. The salute was taken by the elder princess. (ii) 63 troops of Boy Scouts of an average strength of 20 per troop. Both these and the Girl Guides were drawn from the Primary schools of Tehran with one selected troop from each province of Iran. (iii) Students from the secondary schools, aged 13 to 18. 75 platoons of an average strength of 40. These latter wore the national students’ uniform consisting of a grey flannel suit and a blue chauffeur’s cap. (iv) The cadets of the military school - 19 platoons of an average strength of 60. (v) Three platoons of the Iranian Navey - average strength 60. One platoon was drawn from the /CaspianA 1 Caspian Division, the other two from the Persian Gulf Division. (vi) Pour platoons of the Iranian Air Force of average strength of 70. (vii) Two battalions of engineers, one from the 1st and one from the 2nd Division. (viii) The infantry of the 1st Division consisting of 4 regiments each of 3 battalions. (w (ix) The infantry of the 2nd Division (composition as in (viii) above.) (x) Light artillery on pack mules. (75 m.m. Bofors). One brigade of 6 four-gun batteries from the 1st Division and one similar brigade from the 2nd Division. (xi) Field artillery - seven four-gun batteries of Skoda 105 m.m. guns. (xii) The cavalry school (7 troops). (xiii) Four cavalry regiments. Two from each Division. (xiv) Horse artillery. Three four-gun batteries of Schneider guns. (xv) Armoured cars. (xvi) Mechanized field artillery. (xvii) Mechanized anti-aircraft artillery. The march past concluded the parade. The decision to eliminate those displays which had been such a prominent feature in previous years’ parades (such as trick riding, gymnastics, massed physical training and bayonet exercises) was a wise one and the parade lost nothing in impressiveness from being limited to a review and march past. The inclusion of such civilian elements /asas girl guides, boy scouts and students, while in keeping with the idea of a national day and really inspiring as a proof of what can be done with the youth of Iran, naturally spoiled the parade if regarded merely as an exhibition of ceremonial drill. The fact that the parade went off without a hitch speaks highly for the skill of the staff when it is realised that over 25,000 people, 5,000 animals and 80 motor vehicles took part in the march past.APPENDIX. Notes on turn out, drill and organization. A. Turn out - , 1. The turn out of the officers was uniformly good, the only fault being in the matter of their saddlery. This was of widely varying types. Hunting, polo, officers parade and troopers types all being represented. iheir bridles and bits similarly varied from light single bridles with a snaffle to heavy headstalls with double bridles and universal bits. Russian types with cheek 2 . / 3. 4. 5 . pieces crossing on the horse’s nose were also seen. The turn out of the men was not good, the v/retched state of their boots and puttees being particularly noticeable. Many of them were unshaved. Their great coats resembled that amorphous garment issued to Indian troops. The leather equipment was aggressively new in appearance and had not that well-used, well-kept and ’’seasoned” appearance which we aim at. The mules had not been clipped and hardly a mule passed which had not been rubbed bare of hair in several places by badly fitting saddlery. The horses were in good condition but a bit on the fine side. This was most noticeable among the artillery horses and is not entirely due to feeding but to conformation as well. In order to get a heavier animal the Turcoman-Persian cross is used /andand any animal with Turcoman blood in him is apt to have a long, tapering back and to run up light behind like a greyhound. The fact that they are not clipped gives them an odd appearance and it takes a long time for the eye to accustom itself to the sight of a set of hairy fetlocks which might belong to a Clydesdale supporting the weedy barrel of a light weight polo pony. B. Drill - The dressing was poor. The marching was bad. The Iranian army marches to a time of 100 to the minute. The step is a mixture of a slow march and a goose-step. The foot is brought up with the knee bent and is stamped on the ground well in advance of the body. The only way of making this movement smart would be to insist on a rigid and erect body carriage. This is not done and the result is grotesque, each man seeming to 'give' at the waist as if attacked with a sudden spasm of lumbago. C. Organization - 1. Engineers . These were in 13 strong platoons of 70 each with an additional platoon of 32 men with 32 mules loaded with tools. This organization does not tally with that given in my Order of Battle for 1935 but was probably modified for ceremonial purposes. 2. Infantry. (l) No officers were mounted. (ii) Each regiment ('Hang') contained three /battalions/(viii) battalions ('Gurdan') of three companies ('Guruhan”) of three platoons ('Rasad') a machine gun platoon and a signal section. A platoon averaged Headquarters of 6 and 50 men. (iii) Each platoon carried a light automatic (Brno) at the = slope and not on mules. (iv) I was told that on drill order or ceremonial parades one light automatic is carried hut that on field service parades two per platoon is the scale (presumably carried on mules.) (v) The right hand man of the rear rank of the rearmost platoon in each company carries a silk flag about 1' square with its name embroidered on it. The colour is the same as the regimental colour so that its value as a distinguishing emblem seems nil. (vi) Two patterns of entrenching tools were seen. One resembled the Sirhind tool formerly used in the Indian Army and the other appeared to be a miniature pickaxe with a fixed head. (vii) The equipment of the rifleman was as follows Rifle. Eight leather pouches in two groups of four on either side in front. Entrenching tool. Water-bottle. Bayonet. Pack (semi stiff about It’ x li f x 4')* Blanket rolled round the four edges of the pack in a sausage. Greatcoat (worn.)(viii) Two or three Venetian blind type of hand signalling device were noticed in each platoon. (ix) Infantry signallers. Each regiment was followed by a signal section of 40 men with 8 mules. The telephones and drums looked brand new. Each mule carried on the off side two long canvas rolls like a rolled up camp bed in a canvas case. These could not all have been helio or lamp stands nor could they have been collapsible wireless masts in such profusion in units as low down the scale as a regiment. Ten men of the section were armed with revolvers the remainder carried rifles. (x) Infantry Machine guns-. The platoon (one per regiment) contained 60 men with six Swiss machine guns and 18 mules. 3. Light Artillery - (i) About 65 mules per battery. (ii) Battery headquarters consisted of three officers and seven other ranks mounted on horses. (iii) Loads were distributed as follows (when marching past). 1st line of mules carriage. 2nd w tl ii it 3rd t» It it barrel. 4 th » If it breech. 5 th II it ammunition 6 th »» It it tools. 4. Field Artillery - (i) 6 horses per gun, limber and wagon team. /(ii)(ii) 1st line of 4 limbers - 4 men riding on each. 2nd line of 4 waggons - 6 men riding on each. 3rd line of 4 guns - 5 men riding on each. (iii) The gun was a long one and its length was accentuated by a flash eliminator? (a ring bolted on to the muzzle at a ^distance of 4 - 6 H ) 5. Cavalry School - This consisted of ? troops of lancers. No light automatics were carried though they exist in the school for training purposes. 6. Cavalry Regiments - (i) The first regiment (’’Gurdan”) of mixed lance and sabre (front rank lance rear rank sabre) contained 3 squadrons (Aswaran) of 4 troops (Dasta). The average strength of a troop was 32. Each troop carried a light automatic (type not indentified but believed to be Brno). Each regiment had a machine gun troop of 16 guns and 96 horses and 50 men and a signal section of 20 men. (ii) The remaining regiments were sabre regiments and had 4 squadrons apiece. Machine gun troop and signallers as for (i) above. (iii) Rifles were slung and not carried in buckets. 7. Horse Artillery - (i) The formation was a line of limbers - no riders on limbers and a line of guns - 4 riders on gun limbers. /(ii)(ii) Six horse teams. (iii) The guns appeared older than those of the field artillery. 8. Armoured cars - They marched past as follows Headquarter car armoured, high sided, touring car. 4 old Rolls Royce armoured cars. 12 Marmon Herrington armoured cars two machine guns visible. 8 unarmoured lorries (Ford and Bussing Nag.) 9. Mechanized field artillery - Two four gun batteries each consisting of:- Two motor bicycles. One 10 seater armoured Headquarter car. Two motor bicycles. One tender. Pour Marmon Herrington tractors and four Skoda 105 m.m. 'long' guns. Three tenders. Two tenders. 10. Mechanized anti-aircraft guns - Two 4-gun batteries each consisting of:- Two motor bicycles. One 10 seater armoured Headquarter car. Pour Marmon Herrington tractors and four 75m.m. Bofors anti-aircraft guns. Pour tenders.. i EXT.iAGT GUL? INT^LLIG^NO^ REPO^i ?OR LAY 1955 . PSr?31 AN kJl\X . 46. 3tren^;th . It is estimated tnat tne present strength of the Army is about 80,000, and it is believed that the shah eventually hopes to increase this figure to 100,000 men. 47. Training . The standard of training is difficult to assess, but it is probably better in the Tehran garrison than in the provinces. At Tehran, training off the barrack square is confined to movements of units up to one battalion, and a very little weapon training. In the latter connection, it has been estimated that not more than 10 rounds per rifle are expensed each year. As reported in the November summary manoeuvres were held near Tehran, but no foreign observers were allowed to be present. 48. New Iwaterial . Artillery, machine guns, rifles and armoured cars are reported to have been bought recently, as well as a quantity of machinery for the ammunition factories I at Parchin and Tehran. 49. supply and Transport . These services have not kept pace with the expansion of the Army and the number of M # T. vehicles is quite inadequate for important operations. 50. Although the cost of tne Army accounts for such a large proportion of the country's finances, His Imperial Majesty 1 s policy in maintaining such a large force appears to be successful. It probably overawes some of the malcontents (the Baluchis are certainly an exception at present) and undoubtedly instils a certain amount of respect among Persia’s neighbours, particularly Iraq.

An attempt to hold an air review on the anniversary of the Coup d'Etat (22nd February) proved to he a dismal failure. On 21st February four pilots reached Ahwaz with orders to fly the Furies to Tehran in time for the review next day. Time did not permit of compasses being swung, no maps were available, and weather conaitions were unfavourable. Three of the pilots arrived at Tehran on 27th after various adventures in the mountain snows where they had been forced down through lack of petrol. The fourth pilot arrived safely 10 days later, having missed Tehran by 200 Kilometres and being forced to walk for two days to the nearest telegraph office to enable him to oraer more petrol. 60* In spite of this debacle, a review of sorts was held, and consisted of three formations of three aircraft each, followed by a fourth containing five aircraft flyingrather aimlessly over the aerodrome. A Hendon display was hardly to be expected, since the day before the review, General Nakhichvan, commanding the air force, said that no programme had been arranged, but he thought they might do some aerobatics in formation. As this had never been practised before, he was a little doubtful whether it would be a success. His opinion was probably confirmed later the same day by his own experiences for, when landing, he crashed and turned his aircraft on its nose. 61. The estimated strength on 1st torch was:- At Tehran 71 aircraft. At Ahwaz, awaiting construction...17. Under construction in U.K. or en route to Persia 58.- £ - The numoer of aircraft is considerably in excess of the number of mechanics and the latter are still without tools* (R.A.F* Int* Report). —THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI^ BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

The review was certainly impressive. A contributing factor was undoubtedly the large number of men on parade, but, apart from this, foreign observers were struck by the smartness of the troops and those who had seen many similar reviews in the past were agreed that not merely did the present one display an enormous advance over those held eight or nine years ago, but that it represented a considerable improvement even over the review of 1931. 3. The ceremony was spoilt to a certain extent by bad weather. Clouds were low all day and before the end of the afternoon it came on to rain heavily. In consequence the aeroplanes must have had a rough passage, and two of them were, in fact, obliged to make forced landings. It is worth noting that the pilots of the four Hawker machines, which gave what seemed rather an elementary display of aerobatics, were not Persians but members of the Belgian mission. Neverthe less, it must be regarded as a distinct feat on the part of the Persians to have put so many machines in the air at the same time. 4. The Shah remained out in the rain until the very end, though by with drawing no more than a pace or two he could have taken shelter under the covered veranda of his pavilion. He appeared to be in excellent humour, and, judging by his gestures and the number of orders w^hich he gave to his aides-de-camp, seemed to be taking the liveliest interest in even the smallest points of detail. The Cabinet, who were also obliged to stand out in the rain, looked less happy. The Corps diplomatique were accommodated in a special tent next the saluting base, from which they had an excellent view of the proceedings. Despite their close proximity to the Shah, however, His Majesty did not make so much as the slightest sign from beginning to end which show T ed that he recognised their presence. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. (For the Minister), P. N. LOXLEY. Enclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum by His Majesty’s Consul, Tehran. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah held a review^ of troops at Tehran on the 22nd February, 1935, on the Jalalieh parade ground. For the first time since the review of 1931 invitations to attend were issued to the heads of diplomatic missions and their staffs, who were accommodated in a tent set aside for them. Invitations were also issued to a limited number of other guests, foreign as well as Persian. His Imperial Majesty arrived at 2 15 p.m., but did not drive up the parade ground. He approached from a point outside the ground and mounted his charger, and, accompanied by his senior staff officers, rode past the parade at some distance [365 bb—2]mammm mmmmm ~— ■■■ A V from the saluting base, to which he subsequently returned and took up his position below the Imperial standard. ,, He did not receive either heads of missions or the foreign military attaches. At 3 p.m. a detachment of some 300 boy scouts, led by the American scout master in charge, paraded before His Majesty and sang a paean of praise. This was followed by bayonet exercises carried out by a detachment ot the Pahlavi guards. The exercises were carried out with admirable precision. There followed a squad of gymnasts dressed in the colours of the national fl ao -— re( i green and white—who composed a set piece in the above colours, forming a semblance of the Pahlavi crown. 1 he effect was excellent and the movements were well carried out. An exhibition of trick jumping by mounted troops was performed with great dash, and there followed trick riding carried out at the gallop, shooting with repeating rifles from the saddle at full gallop (there were a good many misfires and jams, due either to faulty ammunition or to the weapons used), tent pegging and spearing coloured balls on poles. Two batteries of field artillery carried out crossing movements at the gallop and subsequently fired salvoes. /tt i * j j -n tt During these exercises some fifty-six aeroplanes (Hawker Audax and JJ.H. Moths), flew in formation, arriving from the east and passing over the saluting base, and four machines returned and performed evolutions in the air. The general march past began at 3-45 p.m. and proceeded in the following order :— Detachment of boy scouts. University students. Students taking matriculation. Detachments from the secondary schools for boys in Tehran. One battalion of the military school. One detachment of officer cadets of the Engineers and Artillery. One detachment of the gendarmerie school. Two divisions of infantry, comprising each four regiments of three battalions each, of three companies of three platoons each. Each company 186 strong. Each platoon carried one light automatic, and each battalion was followed by mule detachment with six machine guns and equipment therefor. Each division was preceded by detachment of Signal Corps f carrying wireless and field telephones. Each division was followed by a detachment of the division’s school of n.c.o’s. Three batteries of 105 mm. length Skoda Hipmobile guns. Nine batteries of 75 mm. Bdfors (Swedish) mountain guns. Two batteries of Schneider horse artillery. Two batteries of 75 mm. Bofors anti-aircraft guns of the very latest pattern. Two divisions of cavalry, each division having four regiments of 500 men each. Four old Rolls-Royce armoured cars. Owing to heavy rain the parade was cut short and the supply train of approximately 100 lorries (not specified) did not march past. It was estimated that 20,000 men of all arms (excluding the civilian elements) were on parade. General Notes. All movements were carried out smartly and with precision. All horses and mules looked in excellent condition. In general the officers were well mounted and their saddlery and equipment looked good. The men’s equipment seemed new. Ambulance units did not march past, but were on duty. The parade was under the command of General Hisn-ed-Dowleh, General Officer Commanding the 3rd Cavalry Division.NO DISTHID'JTIQN. 1459 193 5 ) Decypher* Mr. Knctchhull Hugessen (Tehran)* February 13th 1935 D.

We think it most probable that all that the Shah meant when h© talked about a 'British Mission' was the appointment of someone like Walker (see E 6615/914/34) in a purely civilian capacity. We find it hard to believe that he would so far depart from his rule only to employ 'neutrals 0 as to ask for British officers from any of the fighting services.

The latter absolutely discounted the idea that any such scheme had ever been mooted. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CAMPBELL. [265 gg—1]^ 1954 Ji Employment of British air advisers in Persia. Mr. li. !a. Lidderdale, of 51, Kensington Court, W.8. f (who is, incidentally a cousin of Mr. Busk of His Majesty's Legation at Tehran), called at the Foreign Office on kAth October in order to enquire about travelling conditions between Bagdad and Tehran on behalf of ?he wife of a friend. It transpired that the friend in question, whose name was Walker, was going out to Tehran in the employment of the Persian Government in order to assist in the re-organisa- tion of the Persian Air Force. according to Mr. Lidderdale, he served as a R.A.F. officer during the war and more recently had some connexion with the development of I. perlml Airways' services in South Africa. He as leaving lor Tehran fairly soon and had no illusions as to the di^ 1 iciil ties attendant upon service under the Persian Government. Wing Commander Pirie of the Air Ministry has since ascertained that the Persian Government recently asked the De Havilland Aircraft Company who are establishing in Persia a factory for the construction of Ardax and Moth aeroplanes, for an Englishman to take charge of this factory. The J company, with the concurrence of hawker aircraft, chose Mr. %alker. Sing Commander Pirie understands that the appointment is not absolutely settled, but that there is little doubt of its going through. In any case, there is no question of a rival 'mission'' for the re-organisation of the Persian Air rorce. (Signed) L.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 1263 of the 22nd August regarding rumoured negotiations for a French loan to Persia, I have the honour to inform you that it has been ascertained at the Ministry of War that there is no Persian military mission in France at the present time and, in fact, no Persian officer, as the Persian military attache has been recently recalled, whether temporarily or permanently is not known. Nor had the Ministry heard of any negotiations concerning a loan. 2. As you will be aware from Lord Tyrrell's despatch No. 1708 of the 12th December last, a number of French officers on individual contract are at, present serving in Persia.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch yjy No, 188 of April 19th last, and to report that as a result of a series of unpleasant incidents the Swedish Officers attached to the Persian Air Force have given notice that they intend to break their contracts with the Persian Government and are leaving for home in a few days* time. 2. The Swedish Officers are extremely indignant at their treatment and say that, although the Persians are now begging them to stay, nothing will induce them to do so, as they think that to do so would end by damaging the reputation of the Swedish Air Force. If they were to succeed the Persians would take all the credit, and if the Persian Air Force were to come to grief the blame would be put on the Swedish Mission. 3. The incidents included an apparently deliberate attempt to murder one of the Swedish pilots by emptying his petrol tank until only enough petrol remained for a quarter of an hours* flight and a childish attempt to persuade the Swedish Commandant to accept responsibility for an accident in which a Persian pupil and mechanic, who were flying without the permission of the Swedish Mission, were killed. The final straw was that one of the Swedish pilots was dismissed without notice because an aeroplane in The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.in which he was flying had crashed* 4* I learn that the Persian Air Force officers have never ventured to fly the Hawker Hart machines since they reached here last spring: they are afraid of crashing them, which would lead to the imprisonment of the pilot if he survived the crash! 5.

Tehran. January 14. 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Annual Report on Military Affairs in Persia for the Year 1932. (A)— A rmy. G ener al THE Shah continues to interest himself in every detail of army administra tion. Practically every day he visits the Ministry of Mar, the arsenalsore barracks As these inspections are carried out without previous warning and at any hour of the day, the units of the Central Garrison have always to be prepared for a thorough and unexpected inspection by their Commander-in-chief, whose methods of showing his displeasure are direct and drastic. i,. During His Majesty’s periodical tours throughout the length and breadth of Persia, the army is his chief concern, that is to say, after he has dealt wi matters connected with his own personal estates. • , , ,i Funds are always made available for any expenditure required by the Ministrv of War and the military receives preferential treatment in every wav. In consequence, the moral of the army is naturally high but as militarism is being forced on a peace-loving nation, and on account of the peculiar nature of the Persian character, the result is unfortunately an excessively arrogant attitude towards others and an inordinate conceit of themselves. ATTinn(y _ t thp Training continues to improve and become more practical. Amongst t e troops of the Central Garrison this reaches a much higher standard than m the orovmces but throughout the army training for war is carried out on a system and in a manner which could scarcely have been hoped for three or four years ag °‘ The cavalry and infantry are well equipped, but the artillery remains obsolete and out of date*. Arrangements for the purchase of modern artillery aie 111 h and &gt; but for some reason, probably on account of the present monetary exchange difficulties this matter is being very much delayed. Transport is also urgently required, as the pernicious system of com mandeering private transport is still the only means of transporting troops and wai q^gg^on 11 of^eqmpping the air force has been settled and, as is noted elsewhere a large number of modern aircraft have been purchased. The construction of new barracks is being undertaken on a large scale m Tehi^n aml^he prov^ than before was issued forbidding all ranks of the army from having any intercourse or social dealings with any type of foreignei. Tim order is the result of the Shah’s suspicions that his army, on whom he relies for his position may be affected by subversive foreign influences, and it must be remembered that a large number of officers and nearly all the men are uneducated and of a rather primitive type. [691 hh—8] B2 Chiefly as a consequence of the above order, a strong anti-foreign feeling is being created in the army. The Persian character lends itself to influences which pander to self-conceit and arrogance, and there is much propaganda in the army on these lines. Unfortunately, the Shah’s example has produced a system of discipline based on severe punishment, and all training appears to be taught by threats and acts of severe chastisement. « Estimates. The budget allotment for the Ministry of War for the year 1932-33 was 181,689,980 rials. This amount was not sub-divided into separate grants for the various services, but 160,179,980 rials are shown as a total for the upkeep of the army, air force, arsenals, the travelling and study expenses of service students, and expenses connected with naval and military foreign advisers. The sum of 21.500,000 rials was apportioned to the upkeep of the Amnieh (road guards or gendarmerie). In previous years the allotment for this force has been included in the budget of the Ministry of the Interior. The allotment for the Persian navy was not given under the budget heading of the Ministry of War but included in that of the Ministry of Finance, and details were not made available to show the exact sum allotted for this purpose. For the above reasons a comparison with last year’s figures is somewhat difficult, but approximately the total grants are the same, namely, some 48 per cent, of the estimated national revenue. On the 17th March the Majlis passed a Bill allowing a special grant of £1.500,000 from the Government reserves abroad for “ completing the equipment of the army with modern material.” The second part of this same Bill stated that the 6 million tomans allotted for the same purpose in 1929-30 should be considered as the equivalent of £1,200,000. It is not yet known how the above large amount is to be spent, but the purchase of aircraft, artillery, armoured cars and motor transport will almost certainly be effected. New barrack construction, which is now being undertaken throughout Persia, may also be expected to be a large expenditure. Organisation. The Order of Battle of the Persian army has not altered noticeably, the only change of any importance being that the Asterabad Brigade has been abolished and the command reorganised into two units—the Asterabad Independent Regiment and the Turkoman Sahra Independent Regiment—the latter with headquarters at Gumbad-i-Kabus. A new establishment, under the name of the Inspectorate-General of the Army, was formed at the Ministry of War. It is nominally subordinate to the Chief of Staff, and treated as a branch of the General Staff rather than a separate organisation. Amir Lashkar Amanullah Mirza, Jehanbani, on his return from a two years’ staff course in Paris, was appointed as the first inspector-general, assisted by seven inspectors, as follows :— Of artillery. Of cavalry. Of aviation. Of armament and equipment. Of supply and transport. Of musketry. Of medical services. Conscri'ption. The budget allotment for conscription is a sub-heading under the grant to the Ministry of the Interior, and is 350.000 rials, an increase of 50,000 rials over last year. The extended interest taken by the authorities in conscription, as reported last year, continues, and steps have been taken to eliminate the bribery and corruption which previously was, and still is to a great extent, prevalent in the recruiting service.This year lists of men liable for conscription were not issued, but proclama tions were posted calling up all males of a certain age and class. Armaanent and Equipment. The Persian army is now armed and equipped on modern lines with the exception of the artillery. | Ihe large order for arms placed with the Skoda Works at Briinn at the end oi 1929 and beginning of 1930 must have been almost entirely completed by now, and as far as can be ascertained the Czechoslovakian rifle is now in the hands of all garrisons and units. 1 he re-equipment of the air force with modern aircraft is mentioned elsewhere, but armoured cars and motor transport are still required, and more machine guns will probably be purchased. Major Arfa, who has been on special duty in Europe for the past two or three years in connexion with purchase of war material, is known to be making enquiries to buy at least six batteries of field artillery, and it is presumed that pack artillery will also be acquired, as considerable funds have now been made available for such a purpose. Training and Manoeuvres. Manoeuvres, which are now an annual feature to complete training of the Central Garrison, were held a few miles to the south of Tehran in the middle of October. Foreign military attaches were not invited to witness the operations. The following troops were engaged :— Two batteries field artillery (8 guns), Four batteries pack artillery (16 guns), Two regiments cavalry, Six regiments infantry (18 battalions), and a detachment of cadets from the military college. Six aircraft were employed but did not distinguish themselves. One or two engineer units were probably also on manoeuvres, but there is no information on this point. A party of officers from Azerbaijan were distributed amongst both forces, and a detacnment of troops from the Isfahan Garrison, strength about 350, took part in the operations. The total number of troops in the manoeuvre area was approximately 10,000- 11,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 24 guns. The artillery was all of an obsolete pattern. In the provincial garrisons regular manoeuvres were not held, but, as usual troops were in many cases employed in active operations against the tribes. The review of troops to commemorate the coup d'Etat of 1921 was held as usual in Tehran on the 23rd February. On this occasion no foreigners, except those in Persian Government employ, were invited to attend. During the parade, which was conducted on the same lines as last year, some 10.000 troops of the Central Garrison were inspected and then marched past, after each arm had staged a small military display. The general training of the army continues to improve, and field parades and musketry are now a regular and important part of the annual training. A rsenals. As far as is known the two arsenals, one in Tehran and one at Parchin, 18 miles south-east of Tehran, have been functioning on normal lines throughout the year. The Shah continues to take a personal interest in these establishments, and new buildings, particularly in the Tehran arsenal, have been constructed. Further equipment will presumably be acquired for both arsenals from the special grant allotted last March for military purposes. Herr Hartmann, who had been responsible for building and equipping the powder factory at Parchin, and had also been in charge of the Tehran arsenal for some years past, was suddenly and unexpectedly dismissed in May and left Persia accompanied by ten or twelve other Germans who had been employed under him. [691 hh— 81 b 24 Sartip Ismail Khan, the senior Persian official with Herr Hartmann, was put in charge of the arsenals, and a small Czechoslovakian mission was engaged to control the scientific side of the work. (B) —Persian .1 ir Force. The past year has been one of preparation for expansion. Early in the^r year Captain Alis Nordquist, Swede, was engaged as air adviser to the Persian Government, and arrangements were made for the purchase of foreign aircraft. In June Captain Nordquist, accompanied by the Persian pilot Issa Khan, proceeded to England and joined Major Arfa, who has been on special duty abroad purchasing war material for the Persian Government for the past two or three years. As far as is known at present, arrangements have been made for the purchase of forty “ Tiger Moths ” from the De Havilland Company and thirty aircraft from the Hawker Company, these latter to be fitted with 450-h.p. American Pratt and Whitney “ Hornet ” engines. It is understood that ten aircraft, type R. 5, are also being obtained from the U.S.S.R. Expenditure in connexion with these purchases will presumably be debited to the special grant of £ 1 | million allotted for purchase of war material in March. The “ Tiger Moths ” will probably be used for instructional purposes at the new school for pilots which is being instituted near Tehran. The site selected is on the north of the main Tehran-Kasvin Road, 4 miles from Tehran, where the necessary aerodrome and buildings are nearing completion. Sartip Ahmed Khan, Nakhchevan, who has been Commandant of the Persian Air Force for some years past, was under suspension for some months before being appointed Inspector of Aviation in the newly-formed Inspectorate-General at the Ministry of War. Major Khosravani succeeded Sartip Nakhchevan as Commandant of the Air Force. During the annual review of troops in commemoration of the coup d'Etat in 1921, fifteen aircraft flew* over, three small Junkers and twelve D.H. 9a’s, two of which gave a very creditable display of aerobatics. The air force filled an unimportant role during the annual manoeuvres in October, only six aircraft being employed. In April the High Commissioner for Iraq visited Tehran, travelling in a R.A.F. Victoria escorted by two Wapitis, and landed at Qila Murgha, the military aerodrome near Tehran, the Persian Air Force afforded all facilities and showed hospitality and courtesy to our officers and aircraft during their stay. A very successful demonstration was given one afternoon by the above aircraft to those interested. Unfortunately, on account of engine trouble and other misfortunes, the visit of the R.A.F. aircraft to Persia was not an unqualified success, and entailed three Victorias and three Wapitis entering the country in place of one Victoria and two Wapitis intended in the first instance. (C )—Persian Aavy. In 1932 the long expected naval force came into being and arrived in the Persian Gulf in October. It consists of six vessels, built in Italy, as follows:— (a) Two gunboats: Babr and Palang, 68 yards long, 950 tons displacement, 15 knots maximum speed, and armed with two 4-inch and two 3-inch guns. (b) Four patrol vessels: Karkas, Simorgh, Chabaaz, and Sharock, 57 yards long, 330 tons displacement, 15 knots maximum speed, and armed with two 3-inch guns. The above ships left Italy in September, and were inspected by the Shah on their arrival at Bushire in October. His Majesty travelled in one of these ships, escorted by the remainder, from Bushire to Bander Shahpur. The force is under the nominal command of Major Ghulam Ali Khan, Bayondar, but is actually controlled by an Italian naval officer, Commandante Giorgi, and the total complement is 303 all ranks which include forty Italians, eleven of whom are officers.(D )—Amnieh {Road Guard's or Gendarmerie). I he annual allotment for the upkeep of this force was 21,500,000 rials, an increase of 1,490,000 rials over last year. The Amnieh continue to do most useful work, but as they are employed almost entirely in small scattered detachments throughout the country their work not spectacular. The escort duty which they are frequently called upon to undertake has been more dangerous than usual during the past year and they have suffered considerably at the hands of the Lurs and highway robbers in South Persia. Military Operations. The only serious outbreak during the year was that in Luristan. The Provinces of Azerbaijan and Rezaieh (Urumia) were quieter than they have been for many years past. No further trouble was experienced in Kurdistan after the termination of the operations against Jafar Sultan at the end of 1931. In South Persia, Fars, Khuzistan, Bushire and the Gulf Ports have all been suffering from partial famine conditions on acount of the lack of rain and the consequent failure of the harvest. Raiding and highway robbery increased in these areas, but did not call for the employment of troops on any large scale. A column of some 800 troops from Shiraz, under the command of Sarhang Hussein Khan, Pur Rastigar, toured the districts of Dashti, Tangistan and Shibkuh to deal with local disturbances and to carry out the disarmament of the tribes. They returned to Shiraz in July without having achieved any noticeable results. In November a detachment of some 500 men was sent from Shiraz to Ardekan to deal with a small revolt led by Ali Khan, Qashgai, a half-brother of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. In the southern area of Persian Baluchistan the tribal leader Abdul Hussein of Remishk has been in revolt for some time past and receives considerable support from the neighbouring tribes. The area of his activities, Bashkird, is the wildest and most undeveloped district in Persia. In the early spring of 1932 a force of 2,000 all arms, concentrated from the garrisons of Khwash, Bam, Bunder Abbas and Kerman, under the command of Sarhang Muhammed Khan, Nakhchevan, commanding the Baluchistan Brigade, returned to their peace stations, having, it was said, dealt successfully with the revolt. The rebellion, however, has not been quelled, and Abdul Hussein continues to raid freely. An incident connected with this revolt was the capture of the town of Old Task in August by a party of some 250 rebels, who besieged the garrison in the fort until the arrival of reinforcements from Bushire. Operations in Luristan. An autumn campaign was undertaken against the Lur tribesmen. It has been a matter of some conjecture why the Government has not previously dealt with this outbreak. The official policy for some time past has been to deport the Lurs to settlements in other parts of Persia. The villages and nomadic camps were rounded up by troops; it was to be expected that women and children were chiefly collected, and in this manner large parties of Lur tribesmen were made homeless and desperate by the loss of their families and outlawed by the action of the Government. These have been successfully raiding for some months past and have collected a large quantity of gram cloth and stores from lorries which have been regularly looted on the Dizful-Khorremabad-Burujird road. Two incidents of special importance were the kidnapping of a party of officials including the Governor of Khorremabad m July ancl t ^ e holding up of a large number of motor vehicles on the Hamadan-Kermanshah road on the 3rd September when three American consular representatives were temporarily captured ^ [^^^p^gn consisted of an enveloping movement. The Kermanshah Regiment .and the Muzaffar Infantry Regiment, the latter from the Kurdistan Brigade with headquarters at Senneh, were employed to the north and west A strong detachment from Tehran, consisting of the Bahadur Regiment (3rd Regiment, 1st Brigade) and four squadrons of cavalry, one fromeach regiment of the Central Garrison, was sent to reinforce the permanent troops in the area, namely, the Luristan Brigade, whose headquarters are Khonemaba zander of this brigade, Sarhang Mehdi Quli Khkij Baksh, was superseded and Sarhamr Haji Ali Khan, Razm Ara, commanc mg ie Kermanshah ReaiB«?fIVwas appointed to succeed him. - r&lt;o ,. ^ A detaehmBnt from Isfahan is also said to have taken part in the operation The total number of troops employed was approximately 7 , 000 , under tne command of Sartip Murteza Khan, and Sipah Bod (Marshal) Ashmed Ag la x a was in chief control, civil and military, of the whole area, , , Certain sources state that as many as thirteen aircraft are being employed, based on Khorremabad, and that two or three of these have come to gnet. inese figures are, however, probably an exaggeration, but five or six aircratt are certainly at Khorremabad in connexion with these operations, and one or at A.hwaz. i i ' It is difficult to estimate the number of the rebels, but they mav have been up to 3,000 under the leadership of Yadullah Khan, Bairanwand, whose father, Ghulam Ali Khan, had been publicly executed in Khorremabad The rebels consist very largely of the Bairanwand section, whilst the important Saigawand are more or less neutral. The Kakawand appear to )e on the side of the Government, and have to some extent been armed in order that thev mav assist the regular troops on occasion. • ~ The Lurs have with them a senior ex-officer, Sarhang Gigu. This man, some two years ago, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for opium smugg mg at Hamadan, but escaped from the Qasr Kajar prison and managed to reach Luristan The tribesmen were very short of arms and ammunition at the commencement of the operations, but are reported to have collected sufficient for their present needs from the conscript soldiers, who show no desire to fight and freely surrender their arms and equipment. . , Sartip Murteza Khan has now returned to Tehran and been given commanc. of the following troops, which he has orders to equip and prepare as an expeditionary force presumably to be used as reinforcements against the Lurs. All sources agree that the creation of this force has no connexion with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company affair :— Two regiments of infantry (six battalions). One regiment of cavalry. Two batteries of artillery. These troops were still in Tehran on the 31st December. Personnel. Ijanguage Officers. Two Indian army officers were on language duty in Persia during 1932. Captain A. Boyes-Cooper was appointed to Tehran and left on the 2nd October on completion of one year’s study. Captain J. Campbell, who was stationed in Isfahan, left Persia for India on the 16th November. P.

Mr. Clark Kerr to Sir John Sim.on.—(Received December 23.) (No. 447.) , Stockholm, December 16, 1932. ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 41 of the 8 th February last, I have the honour to report that, according to a statement in the press, another Swedish flying officer, Lieutenant G. V. Ekman, has been engaged by the Persian Govern ment to assist in the reorganisation of the Persian air force. Lieutenant Ekman has obtained the authorisation of the Swedish Government and will probably leave for Persia at the beginning of next year. I have &amp;c ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR [663 z—l]27 ft ^Tp^ l — V-/ (23) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 159, dated the 23rd March 1932. (Copy received under endorsement No. 70.) I have the honour to inform you that on March 17th the Mejlis passed, unani- 'Nfiously and without discussion, a bill authorising the Ministry of Finance to pay &lt; \an the Government reservo a sum not exceeding one million, five hundred thou sand pounds (£, 1 , 000 , 000 ) “ to complete the preparation of military munitions,” over and above the six million Tomans (Ts. 6,000WO) earmarked in the budget of 1308 (1930/31) for the same purpose. The Mejlis also agreed that this sum of six million Tomans (Ts. 6,000,000) sho\\\&amp; be considered presumably with an eye to the unexpended balance—as the equivalent of one million, two hundred thousand pounds, (£1,200,000). This should put close on two million pounds (£2WO,000) at the disposal of the Persian Ministry of War for the purchase of new armaments as well as of new plant for the manufacture of explosives and ammunition. A copy of the bill is enclosed, 2. Shortly after the introduction of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law it seemed likely that as a result of the large stocks of imported goods within the country at the time, and the grossly exaggerated figures for exports published by the Persian Cus toms, the Minister of Court would be in a position to assert at the end of the first year of the working of the law that he had succeeded in balancing the international payments of the country without making use of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company royalty ; the latter would then become available for purchase of armaments, to the intense satisfaction of the Shah, as soon as the gold reserve had been completed. But now that this reserve is no longer required for currency purposes, there are not only the future royalties to be disposed of but also those that have remained unex pended in recent years. The total sum available is now probably not far short of five million pounds (£5,000,000). 3. The process of spending would appear to have begun. It remains to be seen whether the Shah will really try to raise and equip an army of seventy-two thousand (72,000) the number quoted by the Persian Representative at the Disarmament Conference—but recent frontier troubles and the arrests reported in my Despatch No. 128 of the 9th March 19.32 [Serial No. (29)J, will probably strengthen him in his conviction that he must increase the forces at his disposal and ensure that these forces (and particularly the Air Force) are better fed, clothed and equipped. 4. As regards the purchase of war material, the movements of Major Arfa, a trusted officer who deals direct with the Shah, are of interest. The first special grant to the Army of six million Tomans (Ts. 6,000,000) was largely expended on the purchase of material from the Skoha Arsenal at Brunn, and Major Arfa w r as entrusted with the actual placing of this order. Last November he returned to Tehran and almost immediately left again for Europe, probably to obtain further quota tions and information. In February of this year, Major Arfa paid another short visit to Tehran, presumably with the object of receiving orders from the Shah. He is now back in Europe and it is understood that he is particularly interested in air craft and artillery. Motor transport is also required by the army and heavy expen diture is anticipated in connection with barrack construction throughout Persia, 5. I have already dealt wdth the bearing of this seemingly reckless expenditure on the question of the debt owing to His Majesty’s Government (see my Despatch No. 146 of the 18th March) and reported that, when I raised this subject, Tey- mourtache asserted that he considered the contemplated expenditure on armaments to be absolutely essential. It may be that he considers it essential, not so much to the well being of the country as to the maintenance of his own position, since a call for economy in this more than in any other branch of national expenditure would imply that the trade monopoly had failed, a conclusion His Highness cannot et bring to admit, least of all to the Shah. pi afflnpc ding copies of this despatch to :— _ The Gdv* * ^ment of India, No. 70. *7 £3 v/M/ Mijcs y’s High Commissioner for Iraq.

It is likewise being sanctioned that the Tomans 6 . 000,000 should be taken as the equivalent of £ 1 , 200,000 which should be drawn in foreign exchange from the reserve funds of the country and that the period of its being debited in the accounts should not be limited to the financial year and the period of action of 1308.

'Khaki* were on the defensive and were under Colonel Ali Ashgar ;' han, Na hdi, who commands an artiller brigade of the Central garrison, with Colonel Hassan Khan, Arfa, of the Pahlevi Cavalry Regiment, as Chief of Staff. The two leaders had unhampered command and no restrictions were imposed on their plans. The director and Chief Umpire was Sartip Zafar ud Dowleh commanding the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Central garrison. Hie appointment was a sinecure as he was not called upon - to make any decisions nor was he asked to express his opinion at the conclusion of operations. Hi 2. Preliminary Arrangements . (l) The Medical Service received orders to arrange that each side had an advanced casualty station and a field hospital and stretchers sufficient for three per cent of the troops engaged.(ii) The Supply Bureau of the Ministry of War was ordered to arrange for three days rations in the field. Supply posts were established at the following points:- Mahdiabad, Surkh Hissar, Jajarud, Latian, Tirakian, and Hastalak. (ili) It was decided that administrative orders on the subject of rations need not be issued during the operations. Chief supply officers were instructed to arrange hot meals for the troops to consist of meat and vegetables. (iv) The rovost Marshals Department of the Ministry of War was charged with clearing and policing the manoeuvre area and were alloted for this ourpose one squadron of cavalry and eight officers from the Amnieh (Gendarmerie!. Notes. (i) The movements of villagers and others in the manoeuvre agre was not restricted but it was iorbidcien to ootain information from such persons. (ii) Units were at field service strength and orders were issued that all movements&gt; by day and night also 9 should conform in every way to service conditions. (iii Special instructions were issued by the Ministry of War for the concentration and dispersion of troops to and from the manoeuvre area. (iv) The arrangements for the supply of iirewood broke down and in consequence the troops did considerable damage to trees in the manoeuvre area. (v) The six aircraft employed (D.H.9 A’s - 4’’Blue* and 2 'Khaki*) operated from the Junkers Company’s civil aerodrome to the East of Tehran. One Junkers aeroplane* propeity of the air force* was used by the Military aviation directing staff. (vi)(vi) Five rounds of blank ammunition per man were issued and guns also fired a small quantity of blank* (vii) It is said that 200,000 tomans was alloted as the manoeuvre grant of which only 10,000 was actually spent (viii) Transport for the manoeuvres was partly army transport and partly lorries, mules and donkeys requisitioned from off the roads in the vicinity of Tehran. (ix) The cadets of the Military School were used as orderlies with subordinate commanders who had instructions to employ them as runners and for other communication purposes. (x) Certain units exchanged their rifles for old ones out of store (for the manoeuvre period}. This was left to commanding officers’ discretion. (xi) A few tents were taken on manoeuvres but only for headquarter formations, troops having to bivouac. (xii) Communication was maintained almost entirely by visual signalling though portable wireless was experimented with. Runners were also employed for local inter- communication. (xiii) It is believed that three anaoured cars took part in manoeuvres but no information is available as to with which force they were employed nor in nohat capacity they were used. It is possible that they were coniined to the Tehran - Jajarud road in the vicinity of which practically no fighting took place. (xiv) It was officially announced that the manoeuvres had no political significance but were only being held to accustom officers and men to service conditions. (xv) A persistent rumour is prevalent that 25 soldiers were killed and 45 wounded during the manoeuvres. This cannot be confirmed, but it is said that some live ammunition was used by mistake for blank. The above story is almost certainly an exaggeration even if founded on fact at all. 3.
