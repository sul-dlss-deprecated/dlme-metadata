Table of the Ruling Āl Sa’ūd (’Anizah) Family of Souther Najd'. It contains seven named individuals (in Arabic and English) of the Āl Sa‘ūd family of the ‘Anizah tribe.The table was compiled by John Calcott Gaskin in 1905 based on a table by Colonel Edward Charless Ross, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that appears in the
                           Persian Gulf Administration Reportfor the years 1879-1880. The table was revised in 1906 by Captain Stuart George Knox, Political Agent at Kuwait, with the assistance of ’Abdur Rahmān-bin-Zaid [‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Zayd], an agent of the Āl Sa‘ūd family.There is a 'Chronological list of the Wahhābi Amirs of Southern Najd belonging to this family' running from Muhammad-bin-Sa’ūd [Muḥammad bin Sa‘ūd] to ’Abdur Rahmān-bin-Faisal (‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal), Ibn Sa‘ūd. There is also a note concerning the tribal origins of the Āl Sa‘ūd family, as well as foot notes concerning the named individuals in the table. It is indicated that the descendents of the sons of Sa’ūd-bin-Muhammad [Sa‘ūd bin Muḥammad] are given in the subsequent genealogical tables.In addition, there is a section of 'Notes' which appear to refer to the geneaological tables on this and the following four sheets (folios 15-18). These notes give the year of compilation as 1906, as well as other details concerning the arrangement of the table, including: the omission of nearly all females; 'issue' means 'male issue'; the ordering of children from the same father according to seniority from left to right, while with older generations seniority is mainly conjectural; daughters are invariably placed in the position of juniority on the extreme right; dates of birth, and in some cases death, are approximate; when the fact or date of death is not mentioned the person was probably alive in 1906.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023876399.0x00000e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
