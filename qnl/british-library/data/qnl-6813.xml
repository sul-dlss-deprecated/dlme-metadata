Cox has telepraphed sayinf that it will bo convenient if he could now make a public announcement definitely that our occupation of Basra is permanent. I fully realise that for international and political reasons it may bo inconvenient at this stape to make a public announcement as sup-posted, but in view of 'Teat advantage of establishing at once a civil administration on a permanent rather than on a temporary basis, I think that this question should be decided at once. »•»***•* TKnEGRAii TO VICEROY, FROM SECRETARY OF STATE, DATED 9TH DECEMBER, 1914. private. Your private tolofram of 7th Docsmber 'CvW®94 % Basra. After careful examination here and consideration by Cabinet I am certain that it would be unwise now to announce permanent occupation. It would be rejrarded as definite breach of the undertakinr between allies that final settlement must await end of the war, and 1 can state confidentially that even our announcement about Cyprus was not too well regarded. Russia in particular would feel fairly entitled to a free hand both in Europe and Asia for parallel announcements, and apart from such difficulties, although we are absolutely confident of ultimate result, the war has not reached a staf-e which justifies annexations, 'rhe steps authorised for administration by our reply to your official telegram of the bth December describinp Cox's recommendations ou^rht to suffice until we are in a position to say more. Meanwhile there is no necessity to define our occupation when dealing with local .fcrabs as either terminable or permanent. It should be a military occupation ensuring civil order and care of revenue with as few organic changes as possible for the time bemf. • CRKWS. TEiiEGRAi; TO VICEROY, FROM SECHETARY OF STATE DATED 19TH DKCBUBER, 1914. Private. Your private talepraia of 9th instant (vide Ho.62 A), tiaara. I fully realise objections to amiouncoraarit of permanent occupation, but would it not be possible to authorise Cox to let it be understood, in conversation but not in writing, in respect of places where we assume control with co-operation of Inhabitants, that, whether we remain permanently *permanently or not, they will in any caae not be handed back to mercies of Turks? This is what the people fear, and before declaration of war His Majesty*s Government did not object to our reassuring Koweit, roharamerah and notables of Basra on that score, Moreover, it is in accordance with policy adumbrated in Prime minister's speech. I strongly ume that this should be permitted. TJ&amp;gCSUM TO VICEROY, FROM 3ECRETAKT OF STATE, DATKD 25TH DECEMBER, 1914. Private. Your private telepram of 19th December. There is no objection to yo r proposal that Cox should allow it to be understood in conversation that places where we assume control with co-operation of inhabitants ^ay in all circumstances count on our future protection against Turks. On the 3rd February, 1915, I&lt;ord Harding who was visiting Mesopotamia at the time, received a deputation from the British coraraunity of Basrah. In reply to their representations. His Excellency said:- 'You are, of course, aware that, in the great struggle in which we are involved, we are not fighting single-handed, and we cannot therefore lay fiown plans for the future without a full exchange of views with the other great Powers who are our Allies, but in any case we may be permitted to indulf^e a eery confident assurance that henceforth a more benign administration will bring back to Iraq that prosperity to which her rich potentialities give her so claar a title.'Since the date of these utterances the situation has to some extent been changed by the negotiations regarding the .\rab State. In these we asked the 'rand Shereef to recognise in the vilayets of Bardad and Basra w that the 'established position and interests of Hreat Britain 'necessitate special measures of administrati vp control. (The weakness of this claim was severely criticised at trie time). The Shereef replied '' r e might anree to leave under 'the British administration for a short time those districts 'now (Nov.5th, 1915) occupied by the British troops, without 'the rights of either party being prejudiced thereby.... and 'againsta suitable sum paid as compensation to the Arab 'Kingdom, foruthe period of occupation.' Beyond t- is he has not gone, and for practical purposes this is enough: i.e. there would be no objection to Hir P.Cox letting it be generally known that we do not intend to withdraw, but it might be impolitic to issue a formal notification to that effect. I have, however, always supposed that it is generally known there that we do not intend to withdraw - and that any doubts in the minds of the Arabs are rather doubts as to our ability to stand our rround against the Turks. Sir M.SykM haa constaatly urred that ** rtiouU mS* » definite pronouncement as to our intentions. The objection is the difficulty of sayinp anything definite, ^fe do not know whether we are p;oimto annex or protect. If we say the former, we are up against the Grand Shereef and the Young Arabs, if the latter, we shall be pressed to say what kind of administration we contemplate, as to which the material is not available to formulate a policy.
