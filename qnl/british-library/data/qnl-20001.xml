For this purpose 100 rifles and IB cases of ammunition were supplied under the orders of the Army Gommander, by the Peputy Director of Ordnance stores, Basrah.- 50 rifles and 9 cases of ammunition belnfr stored in the A.P.O.C Armoury in their big bunpalo^ at Uohammerah and 50 rifles and 9 cases of ammunition being sent - down to Abadan. The scheme however, did not develop and as no further interest was, and is taken by the European community, I beg to enquire what your views arc with regard to its continuance. The rifles were taken over by f -Tr. 'Valpole who /as General Manager of the A .P.O.C .Ltd., here at the time^nd no check has been kept on them. As a result of my request to be furnished witha a statement I find that some of the rifles and amunition are missing and cannot be accounted for.

The Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh has lately addressed letters to hoth H.M*s Vice Consuls at Ahwaz and Dizful and to H. E. The Shiekh of Mohammerah on the subject of West Kharkeh lands within the Persian Boundary at present inhabited by sections of the Chenana tribe. The Wali claims that the major portion of the country at present occupied by the Chenana is within the boundary of Pusht-i-Kuh and states that he intends to sell or rent the same to Shiekh Abdul Karim the son of the - notorious Ghazban. H.E.The Shiekh of Uohammerah is naturally much concerned at this news and considers the whole matter to be due to the intrigues of Ghazban who is now in Baghdad, 4 x V o ^ A^&gt;art from the Wail's claim to a district which as far as I am aware has never been considered to be a - portion of Pueht-i-Kuh t the Chenana will undoubtedly resist J , any attempt to place Shiekh Abdul Karim in a position of authority over them again. Shiekh Abdul Karim himself is I understand, an ouiaw from the Government of Mesopotamia which palces the Wall's action in an unfavourable light with regard to ourselves.v The whole matter appears to resolre itself into a gratuitous attempt by the Wall to extort money from H,2. The Shiekh by the threat of an action whioh is bound to cause serious disturbances on his borders. I therefore beg to request that the Wali may be communicated with by your Bxcellency with a tiew to the expulsion of Abdul Karim from his territory. The Shiekh of Mohammerah will himself take all possible steps to settle any boundary dispute with the Wali direct, and has replied to the Wali in these terms. Personally I have replied to the Wali that I am somewhat surprised at him showing such excessive kindness to an outlaw from Mesopotamia and am of the opinion that the matter is likely to cause considerable trouble without any corresponding benefit to any one.

K r Hi h.B.M's Vice Consul Dizful. s I r; 1 have the honour to submit herewith a report on an c- lent which culminated in an attempt at riot on the 21gt instant. number of ^eyeds,Mollah8,and merchants arrived from bLushtar at the end of last week and preferred claims against one Khojeh Jawad Haqi,a merchant of Dizful,who had loclared himself bankrupt, x On the arrival of his creditors Khojeh Jawad Haqi took refuge in the house of Haji Sheikh kohd -eza,hujut-ul-l8lam, and the Deputy Governor requested my advice as to what action he should, take. Although he explained that Haji Sheikh Mohd Heza had no right to afford i^ast' to a man fleeing from his creditors,I replied that as Haji Sheikh Mohd Heza was an influential personage he had better take no action at all until Khojeh Jawad Haqi had left his premises,and that as some of the creditors were also religious loaders,they would no doubt be able to arrange matters satlofaotorily therasalves. On the night of the 18/l9th the Deputy Governor rocoived information that Khojeh Jalrad Haql had left the ou.^e of haji oheikh j'aohd iieza and had proceeded to his own house which was close to that of the latter's.and that he . intended to leave the city. The Deputy Governor accordingly.. , accordingly ordered the Chief of Itka Police to arrest him. When the Chief of the Police arrived Kh^Jeh Jawad Haqi managed to evade arrest and again took 'Bast 11 in Haji Sheikh iaohd Heza's house. Haji Sheikh Mohd Reza then complained to the Deputy Governor at the disturbance caused by the Police and also informed me. The matter was eventually discussed between the Deputy Governor and Haji Sheikh idohd Reza,who convinced that no attempt had been made to invade his sanctuary,proclaimed himself satisfied and promised to get rid of his unbidden guest as soon as possible. The above is a full account of the incident which was seized upon by a member of bad characters as an excuse to give vent to their feelings. The present financial difficulties of the BistKie District have given rise to a number of rumours and the worst characters probably considered that the moment was an auspicious one to make an attempt to overtlirow Constituted Authority,and incidentally to render the position of this Vice Consulate impossible,as it is solely by virtue of the influence of this Vice Consulate that such authority exists. I am convinced that Qutb-ua-SauUit hi^aelf at once seized the opportunity to spread rexorts that the sanctuary of Haji Sheikh Loiid Reza^s house had been invaded,and engineered meetings to put forward a protest, but in reality to create a serious disturbance. This man*s record is full of similar incidents, and it has always been a source of wonder to a succession of Political Officers here,what spirit it is that moves him to create unrest and indulge in intrigue,when no one is more fully aware than tfhe himself,that his interests are bound up with our own,and that a state of disorder would result in his ruin. This fact he is only too readyready . to admit himself in his more lucid moments. The final meeting at which it had been decided to take some sort of action was held early on the morning of the 21st instant and was practically solely attended by Qutb-us-^adat*s own adherents and a few of the Riff-raff of the Town. • I had no opportunity of seeing for myself but was informed that some 500 persons were armed. I was aware of the intention to hold this meeting during the night and hastily drafted the Sagwand Levy into the Town and reinforced it with as many tribesmen as it was possible to collect. I arranged for Qutb-us-Sadat Haxifc and his followers to be informed that I would not hesitate to attack his quarter and arrest him if any disturbance % took place,and that I was in a position to be assisted by as many armed towns-people from other quarters as I cared to call upon. The meeting collapsed,no resolutions were passed, and by the evening I was able to dismiss all sowars on duty. It must not be imagined that Qutb-us-Sadat has not covered his tracks,and I have no actual proof to enable me to demand his expulsion. I am however personally convinced of his connection in the matter,and take the opportunity to place it on record that he is the most dangerous personality in Dizful,and one v/hose movements should never be lost sight of. Two of the leaders of the meeting have since been arrested and deported to Shushtar to be dealt with by H.E. The Governor General,and I consider that no further action need be taken in the matter.1 an arranging with »jhelTch rt ^nhar^rah tr taTre the neceBsary steps to curtail Qutb-us-Sadat * s activities in future as the latter owes his present prosperous position mainly to the fact that he manap-es the estates of H.E. in Dizful.

As far as Wall is concerned the question of Ahdul Kerim is disposed of as he had been induced to leave Wali and make submission to this Government. His affairs and those of Gadbhan are at present under the consideration of the Iraq Government and the high Commissioner is doing his best to see that none of them are allowed to upset the affairs of the Amarah division and incidentally lands bordering on the Shaikh's territory.

Copy with comnllments tc:r Hon'ble The o ^itloal Resident, Persian ^ashlre.,^ H• B. .' s Consul , Mohanerah.Summary of conversation between H.B.M's Minister, Sir Percy Lorraine ar).d H.E.The Sheikh of Mohamerah, on board H.M.S.Crocus,on December 5th,1921. Colonel Trevor,Political Resident,and Mr.Peel Consul at Ahwaz were also present. The Sheikh dwelt at some length on his services to the British O-overnment both before and during the war and said that he had hoped that after the victory of the Allies he would find his influence and prestige greatly enhanced. He noticed however that H.I'I.G.tended to support the Persian Government rather than himself in questions which were of vital interest to him and he citeu. the case of his revenue in which he considered that H. — .G.ought uo have insisted on the recognition by the present Persian Government of the arrangement made between Sir Percy Cox H and Vossuq ed Dawleh at the begining of 1920• Mr.Peel explained to Sir Percy Lorraine the position regarding the Sheikh's revenue,which is as follows:- The Sheikh ^as paid no revenue since 1913 and claims from the Persian Government a sum of approximately 700000 tomans which he spent during the war in maintaining law and order in Arabistan without any assistance Irom the Persian Government. He proposed to Sir Percy Cox that the revenue unpaid during the war should be set against his claim and that from March 1920 he should pay only half revenue for 12 years. After prolonged negotiations between Sir Percy Cox and Vossuq ed Dawleh the latter agrees to v. T aive the revenue unoaid during the war and to accept half revenue from the Sheikh for 6 years as from March 1920.He wrote a Memorandum to this effect to the Minister of Finance and tlse result was communicated by Sir Percy Cox by telegraph to the Sheikh of Mohamerah. Unfortunately matters went no further and no orders were officially communicated to the Sheikh dj the Persian Government of a nature to satisfy the Sheikh or bind the Government's successors in office. In the meantime the Sheikh refused to pay any revenue and Mr.peel visitedTehran/in the summer of 1921 in the hope of obtaining some definite pronouncement from the Persian Government. Qawam- us-Sultaneh siAted that neither his Cabinet nor the Medjliss could possibly accept the arrangement made by Vossuq ed Dav. r leh but that he was willing before the Lledjliss met to issue orders waiving the Sheikh's revenue unpaid during the war but insisting on payment of full revenue from ilarch 1920. This was accepted as better than nothing and the necessary orders were issued and communicated to the Sheikh. The latter repudiated this new arrangement and is now trying to recoup himself by obtaining sanction to a revised budget under which the Persian Government will accept liability for much of the expenditure on maintaining law and order in Southern Arabistan which was formerly borne by the Sheikh. (In conversation with Haji iiushir I£r.Peel learnt that the Sheikh hoped to obtain the following: 1. A gift of 1C000 rifles from the British Q-overn- ment. 2. The title of Governor of the Gulf ports. 3. A percentage of the Mohamerah Customs receipts, the great increase in which had'not beenacHiictix anticipated by him v/hen he originally agreed to the establishment of a Customs post at Mohamerah). The conversation then turned on the general situation in Persia. The Sheikh pointed out that H.M.G.had alienated the sympathy of prominent people in the capital by the support extended to Seyyed Zia ed Din and by its refusal to intercede for Nusrat ed Dawleh and others who had been imprisoned by the Seyyed. He produced a list of persons in Tehran who ought to be ' squared' by the British Government if the latter wished to regain its influence. The Minister explained that he did not propose to purchase his friends and the Sheikh did not read out the names in the list. The Sheikh also stated that he thought the ftaoi'gh ought to be pressed to remain at Tehran until a strong Government had been formed in Persia^.The Minister explained that until he had reached Tehran 9 Cpyu*u,i/- and seen things for himsfelf he could not ttouiinruint himself to any definite line of action. He made it quite clear however that he did not propose to discuss any form of agreement with the Persian Government until the latter had expressed its contrition for the studied insults it had offered to H.M.G.and could give adequate guarantees that it would abide by any future agreement. The Sheikh suggested that any future agreement which might be negotiated should be signed by the ruling chiefs. The Sheikh finally agreed that the money spent by H.M.CKin Persia during the last few years had not produced any favourable result and that the wisest course was to leave the Persian O-overnment alone until it came to its senses. The Minister assured the Sheikh in very general terms of his personal friendship and good will.c No. l+IS S of 1921 • D British Rooldoncy and Conmilato-Gonoral, Buohlro, 2r5rd Deooinber 1921 • From The Hon'bie Lieut -Gol» A.P.Trevor, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# To The Hon'ble Mr# D do S» Bray, C # I # K ## C # B«K # f I .C .S#, Kor^ ign secrntary to the Govomnent of India in the Foreign nd Political Departnent, Delhi.

It is only about 10 months ago that the Khasraj and Chen^na were part of the Bs.ni j^am and the Bani Lara are still sore at their being made independent. They would regard an order to pay Kodah to 3haikh Zamil as intolerable. Shaikh Zamil was formally lecognized as an independent shaikh under the jurisdiction of Dizful on the clear understanding that he would not attempt tu taice koda from the Bani Lam, without permission. I do not think permission should be given to him. As far as I know the Shaikh of ' r uhammerah has never been able to enforce his theoretical right to take this koda and it does not appear to me advisable for nim to try and do so now.Tolegram Code.

Eepeated Resident,Bushire Dated and received 17th April 1922 according to the Sheikh of Mohammerah it is the intention of the Persian Government to send Persian troops to Arabistan. He is much disturbed at proapect and in his opinion action is a deliberate threat against him and appeals for our intervention under our agreement. He points out with truth that he has gradually and with our support established himself and brought under his control tribes which were continually giving trouble under Persian Administration and he decfciares despatch of small force to Arabistan will inevitably lead to unrest and anarchy in which British Commercial interests must suffer. I believe as regards tribes now under Sheikh of Mohammerah his arguments have much weight and that attempt to pursue anti-Sheikh of Mohammerah and anti-Bakhtiari policy would react unfortunately on Oil and other commercial interests unless it is supported by sufficient strength to guarantee peace and Sheikh of Moh ammerah and Bakhtiarls would not be sorry to discredit the Persian Government by the unrest which would be created® Pitzpatrick■./ 26/106 &amp; 26/148.

If it is the intention of the Persian Goverrment to send troops to Southern Arabistan where none have been stationed for years, and tihere the Sheikh of Mohamnerah maintains excellent order, I certainly think Sheikh is r/ight in thinking that action is deliberate threat against him. In fact unless there is some such motive it is not clear why Persian Government should want to lock up troops in a peaceful orderly province when there is so much work for them elsewhere and the ccmtry^ finances are in such a bad way. I think that Sheikh is right in thinking that the presence of Persian troobs will cause unrest among the Arab tribes, and should this occur it will undoubtedly react unfavourably on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company arid British interests generally. I am not sure whether despatch of troops to Southern Arabistan could be considered an 'encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognized rights' vide letter of assurance dated November Slst 1914 to Sheikh, but as there were no troops* in Southern Arabistan to best of my belief in 1910 when first assurance was given nor in 1914, despatch of troops is certainly a change in status quo and is such might perhaps be considered an encroachment. In any case I think that the despatch of troops is a menace to Sheikh^ present state of local autonomy which we have promised to do our best to maintain { vide penultimate paragraph of same letter) and that the pr©DOsa^ ought to be nipped in bud if possible#** K I earneatly hope therefore that it may be possible to prevent despatch of troops to Arablstan, or at any rate to Southern Arabistan which is controlled by Sheikh.26/106 and 26/148.

Persian Governmeni apparently estimate that he owes them from 500,000 to 700,000 Tomans and I understand in Seyid Zia^ time he was actually willing to compound for 300,000 Ts. I cannot therefore understand statement of Consul Ahwaz that according to Revenue Department there is no balance outstanding (your te 1 egram No.128) That view is certainly not shared by Persian Treasury.

Dated A or11 15th. 1922. Congratulations to all the Mussalmans and particularly V to the Committee of Mesoptamia at Teheran. After having made sacrifices for Islam for two and a half years, I have, thanks to G-od, attained my sacred aim. Although all the efforts made for the support of the foreigners (i.e., the British) against the interests of Mesopotamia were only carried out by Sheikh Khazel and that as a result the British policy has succeeded to some extent, yet the people considered me responsible for these events and the cause of the British success. I in vain declared that I am opposed to the ideas of 3heikh Khazel. fw fortunately, two months ago I proceeded to Koweit where I gathered all* the Chiefs and oheikhs in the presence of H.H. Ibn-i-Massood. After several meetings, all the Chiefs unanimously v/rote a letter to the Sheikh in the following terms; - 'Up to now we were in hostile relations with each other, but hereafter as Ibn-i-Massood has risen to defend Islam, we have given up our hostilities and we are most willingly prepared to support Ibn-i-Massood. If you wish to maintain your old policy, ie., to support the British, we would be compelled to annihilate'you first and then our religious enemies.' Besides this letter, on my return to Mohammerah I explained verbally to the Sheikh all that was necessary and T.e latter a±ter 5 days proceeded to Koweit in order to discuss the matter with the people concerned. After long discussions, the Sheikh declared his willingness to give help and support to the movement on condition that the matter should be kept secret, and that they should abstain for 3 months from any activities in order that h^'may be able to make everything ready for this purpose. H. Hev. Seyed ilbul Hassan of Ispahan who was particularly summoned for this purpose from Mejef has arrived at Koweit and subsequently all those who were present took an oath- 2 - IS that they would be united with each other and that they ti would give up fchwinr hostilies amongst themselves. The ecclesiastics and Ulemas of Wejef as well as the Chiefs of the tribes of Mesoptamia who 'became aware of the matter have realised that I have rendered valuable services to Islam. Thanks to God, I have attained my object and I have no other wish in this world. The Sheikh and i3eyed Abul Hassan are at present at Koweit and they will proceed in a few days to Mohamraerah, We hope that the activities of all the Mussalmans will very shortly be crowned with success. As you receive regularly letters from India f you are being no doubt aware of the agitations which are/carried out in that country, v /here the conditions are getting worse every day. According to a letter received from Damascus addressed to the Committee 'Zat el Ilm' , Abdul Vahed, the Chief of the tribes has left for Mecca with a view to induce the inhabitants of Beymil Tahra (?) to rise against the British, and also to acquaint the Sherif of Mecca with the facts and make him allied with his ideas. As regards Seyed Baghi Khan Sadat Kalantari, please do not let him remain any longer in Teheran. Send him immediately to Ispahan in order to carry out his duties in that city. Jewdet Bey^ the Commander of the troops at Koweit has made his best effort to support our aims. He has trained a number (3,000) Arabs (Bedouins) and he awaits instructions from Ibn-i-Massood. A considerable quantity of arms and ammunition have been sent to them by the fiherif of Mecca. I hope, God willing, we will succeed to annihilate the aliens and to bring all the world under the banner of Islam.

Lieut-Col., Political Resident in the Persian Cuif,IDEKTIAL: » No. Consulate for Araoist^n. L'ohammerah, 24th, June 1922. To, The Honfble the Political Resident in the Persian'Gulf. Bush ire. M5M0BANDIM: For some years past Sheikh Ohassib Khan was holding the appointment of Deputy Gov-rncrship of Mohammerah. Later, H.E. the Sheikh of Mohanrnerah, getting dissatisfied -vith him, dismissed him and replaced him 'by his 3rd. son, Sheikh Abdul Mai id, brother-in-la v of Ha.ii Moshir, an untrustworthy youth of practically no experience or common sense. From the day he has been entrusted with the governorship, he has been committing horrible cruelties and outrageous crimes, so muoh ^o that the inhabitants have no security of their property and even the safety of their lives. So long as his exhort ions and crimes were directed towards Persian subjects, thi a Consulate apparently did not take any hs interest in the matter, but it was not long after when he showed an inclination of extending his limit^s and mal-treating British and British-protected subjects. The following is a summary of a few on the many irregularities committed by Shnikh Abdul ^iajid:- 1) He was found in possession of the stolen property (e draft for Es.3000/-, and other articles estimated over ?s.600/-) belonging to Mr. Mann, an employee of Messrs. the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd, . Basrah. For full particulars please see para 71 ofcontinued 2 of Diary No.12 of 1922. I hear that the property has not been ret ^rned yet, hut 2r. Mann has sufoc- questly been compensated. 2) He confiscated the property of, and imprisoned, a bona fide Bahreiny subiect, on his landing at Mohammerah, without any fault whatsoever. After a great deal of correspondence with Sheikh Abdul Majid, H.E. Sheikh Sir^Khan, and H.B.M's Consul, Ahwaz, and after Sheikh Abdul Mai id's self- con tradictary and false-rerresentations, the property was recpvered^the Bahreiny released and advised to le r ve the place, please see para 101 of Diary I\ T o,16 and para 124 of Diary No.19 of 1922 for fuller particulars. 3) He imprisoned and molested a motor-driver of Messrs. Strick, Scott Co.,Ltd.,without any reference to this Oonsulare or the Oomnany, Lor not obeying his orders when told to drive his motor boat to Abadan at dead of night, after a days's strenums toil on part of the unfortunate man. 4) He broke into the hou e occupied by a British subject, an employee of Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Go., Ltd, and threw out this employees luggage for the sole purpose of occupying the house himself. 5) He confiscated Krs. 4,575/- from a Bahreiny for no ,fault whatsoever, the amount, however, was recovered after taking utd the matter with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, vide para 117 of Diary No.18 and para 124 of Diary No.19 of 1922. X 6) He has now imprisoned the same Bahrieny (as per para 5 above) to revenge himself for the previous Case. I no .v hear that Sheikh Abdul Majid has told the man that so long as he claims British protection he would put him in trouble, and that the sooner hedeclined British protection ha would be released. The case has been referred to H. E. Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, through H. B. M f s. Consul, Ahwaz—vide letter No. 10/6/1049, dated the 16th June, 1922, copy forwarded 4)0 the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian 51b Gulf, Bus hire. 7) His outra^Bs have culminated in the assault, trespass, • ^-fraand savage treatment towards a British subject, viz., Mr. C. 0. Kennedy, an employee of Messrs. Strick, Scott £ Co., Ltd., Mohammerah. Repeated representations have been made by this Consulate direct and through H. B. M ! s. Consul, Ahwaz, to H. B. Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, who has Always admitted the senseless attitude of his^ son, and regteliei his son f s actions, and severely reprimanded him ; but Shaikh Abdul Majid does not seem to have come to his bearings. If he aver repents it is only momentary. It is unnecessary to add that such high-handedness and such irregularities have greatly reflected upon the prestige of this Consulate, and if tolerated much longer, will tend to prove/ most igtixix detrimental as regards the interests of British subjects generally. I hear privately that Haji Rais, through a personal erudge, is endeavouring to create trouble for this Consulate Munshi, and will most probably have the ready co operation of Shaikh Abdul Majid to this end. In view of the above circumstances I confidently trust that you will take such aotion as you ,T iay consider xasxxsar necessary. In (bharge current duties, British Consulate for Arabistan.26/106.

Since he has been Governor he has I am informed committed the following illegal acts amon^ others. 1. Found in possession of stolen property belonging to er^ploy^ of Messrs.the Mesopotamian Persian Corporation. 2. Imprisoned and confiscated, property of a Bahraini without ref rence to the Consulate. 3. Imprisoned motor driver employed by Strick Scott without reference to Consulate or Company. 4.

Had llr.C .O .Kennedy a British India Subject employed by Strick S ®ott draped out of his house and unmercifully thrashed without any reference to Consulate or Company. It is evident that a youn*; man of this sort is totally unfit for the post of Deputy Governor, and I think His Excellency if h^/considers matter will af;ree. Before ta in^ up matter officially I should like to r.ive Sheikh opportunity of dismissing Abdul Majid and promising not to employ him a.p;ain till he comes to years of discretion! if he ever does). I think the Sheikh would be well advised to fine Abdul Majid for offence 7. I may add in this connection any settlementarrived at with the company does not affect the principle that it is an affront to the British Government to assault and and maltreat British subjects in Persia as by Treaty/ usafje only British Government has jurisdiction over subjects. If I have to tklce up matter officially with Minister and Government of India it will become very serious and I strongly advise the Sheikh as a friend to deal with matter at once himself. He presumably realizes that if he allows his son to ride roughshod over treaty and customary British rights it will alienate British sympathy from him and reach unfavourably on his interests.

Regret Sheilih appears to misunderstand case !fo.7; I do not suggest punishing Sheikh Abdul 1,1ajid for beating Kenned y but for sending policeman to house of and 'beating British subject without first reporting matter to Consulate and at least haying represen x ative of Consulate present when Policeman went. S hk J c I mx In the circumntances wh^tjpr Kennedy i interfered with Persian women or not is beside the point. As a British subject as lon^; as H.ii the King has extra territorial rights in Persia Kennedy is subject to British law and not to arbitrary methods of inexperienced and hot-headed Deputy GoTernor! The proper course would have been to report his inter!ererce to Consulate or Residency and if case proved he would have been suitably punished. Please inform SheiVh I regret I must press for Sheikh Abdul Majid's dismissal. As he knows in all these years I have never ask'ed him to remove a Denuty Governor before and would not do so without just cause. The Kennedy case is the culminatinr affair of a Ions; series of unjust, oppressive, and tyrannical acts (some of which were enumerated in my telojram No.1148) committed against British subjects and proteges by Sheikh Abdul Liajid. Latter haB already had several cBiances and is obvious ly incorrigible; Dr.Lincoln had to report him to Sheikh several times and on MaylSth Dr. Lincoln reported ^ propos o' 1 case of confiscating 4000/-krans from a Bahraini w T spolre very seriously to the Sheikh and told him I could no longer tolerate these actions by his son who had fallen a ^reat deal in my estimation and whom I could, no longer believe or t^ust. The Sneikh1 ac^nowljd eel hi8 son harl proved himself worse than his elder brother Chasib x x x He promised to taVe up natter seriously x x x x If this sort of thinjr continues I am afraid there will be no altematire but to ask Sheilrh to remove him and appoint another Deruty Governor** . Af;ain on the 24th May he reported re SheiTrh Abdul Uajid's failure to return Toods talren from Bahraini in spite of Sheikh's orders and his own promises took up matter most seriously with th© Sheilrh who regretted incident and deputed Uamur to get hol^ o'^ the golden articles and rioney from Sheikh Abdul Majid'. In the circumstances I do not think Sheikh Abdul Majid deserves ax±xk another chance and I regret I must press for his dismissal• The Sheikh knows I would not do this hastily, and I should like him to understand also that I dp not mean to drop it and that if he warts help from us he should reciprocate It is of no conseouence to me who is Deputy Governor as long as he does /his work properly and does not interfere with British subjects and proteges and of course I leave the question ol a substitute entirely to His Excellency^ discretion.

We must therefore decide what our attitude is to be tXBX towards thfei plan and recognize that although the presence of Persian troops in Arabistan is undesirable (we cann I ot?) oppose their despatch to any part of Persia. We have no redress if our firendly representations are disregarded by the Persian Government and shall have either to agree at the same time trying to obtain immunity for Sheikh's dominions or oppose whole plan by (1) Veto which is impossible to back up by physical force (2) Sop to Minister of War in shape of fresh loan which he is I know on the point of asking for (3) Encouragement to Bakhtiari Khans upon which they would certainly oppose passage of troops. All these plans have their obvious defects, but their rejection leaves only acceptance as an alternative. Our attitude must be defined clearly and I should be glad of instructions as to whether I am to risk being on bad terras with the Minister of War and the Persian Government by setting my face against the proposal.

The following is a confidential message which I desire you to send to the Sheikh of Mohammerah from me Begins. When the following message is read to your Excellency you will understand ay constant/solicitude for Your Excellency's honour and welfare. To my great astonishMnt and annoyance I heard a few days ago that a detachment of Persian troops had started from Isfahan for Arabistan via Bakhtiari. Numbers reported to be 500 with cannon and machine guns; Prime Minister since/ assures me there are only 200. Very energetic representations were immediately made by me to the Prime Minister and the Minister of War saying despatch of troops to Arabistan was ui^essary and dangerous more especially as complete tranquility reigned in Arabistan and troops were urgently required elsewhere to crush rebels in Azerb/aijan, Gilan and Luristan and to repress brigands on many trade routes and as a result the Persian Government agreed to stop the detachment from proceeding any further. Prime Minister visited me himself yesterday and begged me to reconsider my attitnide which I declined to do. He said if he had known I objected detachment would not have been sent and it was nor difficult to recall without loss of prestige and difficulties in the Medjlie. I replied that if he had consulted me he would have known what my opinion was first and that some two months ago I had made my ideas clear ±) ib to the Minister of War. I added I viewed the project with the utmost disfavour and feared that the introduction bf a new force in a province which was quiet and orderly could only produce trouble and difficulties and wished him to abandon. His Highness said that both he andthe Minister of War were ready to give formal aesuranceB to ftazra Your Excellency that troops were merely to act at Shushtar as the Governor-General's own guard and would do nothing to interfere with you or your territories. They will both in all probability telegraph ix to Your Excellency in this sense and you will doubtless reply in manner best suited to your own interests• I have discussed the matter thoroughly with Sirdar Jang and Samsam-es~Sultaneh* We are in agreement that you and they must bring pressure on the Persian Government to impress on them the danger of sending troops and its undesirability in view of local conditions,that every peaceful mean must be must be Employed to induce the Persian Government to abandon the project, and that the steps which I have already taken must be supported by you and the Bakhtiari Khans in your own interests. It is undesirable,and should not be necessary if we all work together,for the Khans to stop the detachment by force though they of course could do so« I trust that Your Excellency is in good health and that you will soon send me news.

The Sheikh is re/lying on our support and says that we cannot hold him responsible for the protection of British interests if troops are sent to Arabistansj . Confidential. If it becomes generally known that the Persian Government are sending a detachment to Arabistan there is a great risk of the Sheikh's influence being undermined and of our interests being adversely affected thereby.

Aooording to reports receivea arms and ammunition are sent via iJiwaz, on behalf of the British Government, to Luristan where they are exohunged for wool, cattle eto. amply This fact is/proved by the arms found in possession of those who attack the town and who, contrary to the past, are not in need of arms and ammunition. Besides the fact that the import of arms in the manner ahove-mentionea is contrary to the international usage providing the tribes with arms and ammunition will create great difficulties for the Grovernment. Moreover certain people, on behalf of Mesopotamia, are instigating and encouraging Persian soldiers on tne frontiers to join the Mesopotamia army and some men have already been taken to that country. The attitude above-mentioned is, of course, contrary to the good neighhourly relation# which the Persian CJovern- ment expect. The Forei n Office therefore requests the British Legation to be good enough to send strong telegrams to the proper quarters with a view to preventing these unexpected measures, which will aisturb the organizations of the country, and to inform it of the result.To the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Tehran, June 1st, His Majesty's Minister has the honour to aoimowledge the receipt of the Ministry for Foreign -affairs* communioation No. 11999/801 of May ^Ist (Jouza 10, 1301) giving utterance to the allegation that arms .and ammunition are being sent through Ahwaz 'on behalf of the British Grovernment 11 to Luristan, where they are exchanged for wool, cattle etc. and proceeding to discourse on international obligations as regards the di stri but ion etc., of arms. This is not the first time that Sir Percy Loraine has received accusations of un-neighbourly action by the British authorities, unsupported by any sort or icind of evidence: many complaints of this vague and unsatisfactory character have been investigated and on each occasion have been proved to be entirely without foundation, while the reports on which they were basea have been shown to be the work of mischievous and intriguing persons. In this case therefore Sir x ercy Loraine is compelled to state that unless the Persian Grovernment provides him with reasonable concrete evidence in support of the present com plaint, he is unable to take any steps whatever to have it investigatea. He furthermore begs leave to express his regret that the Persian Government should apparently set so little value on their relations with Great Britain as to make so serious an accusation without a shred of evidence to support it.26/106.

Danger of the appearance of Somitkoos in the South# The eurface of the Eakhtiari territory hae been coloured rith the blood of the children of the motherland| 250 men have been butchered in Eakhtiari territory, the soldiery that were going to Arabia tan were cut into pieceti in that place. % After all, the interview of Sardar Aqdas with the Bakhtiari Khans produced its reeult^-that Baioe meeting doecribed by us in Fo.22 of the Shafaq-e-£orkh about which we declared ecme suspicion ard which was said to be an ordinary affair by SamBam-oB-Galtaneh a in hix a letter sending/copiy^ of the telegram froir the Bakhtiari Khans. Semitkoo has this time made his appearance from among the Eakhtiari tribe —the same tribe which enjoyed the highest pooi- tion in the public opinion. The British diplomacy i this time caused the terrible spectre of Feudalism to aripe cut of the Eakhtiari, The time should be awaited *hen it will ^frise in Pars in the person of Qawam-ol-Molk. The visit of Uoin-ol-Islam or . Eohbehan to Bfefebehan and his interview with the Eakhtiar'i Chiefs on behalf of Qawam-ol-tfolk showed one of its results. We wonder if the Government is asleep and docs not see this most powerful and blood-stained hand that has emerged from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and plays tho Dc®*t deadliest role among the tribes? As the dcjJLry^Qf the above mentioned Government becomes weak in the world and her moral influence decreaees in Persia, she begins more dangerous games with our destiny. Perhaps all do not know, but those persons who are well aware of the internal current affairs and the present situation. do know that when the Ministry of TTar decided to send a force of 300 men to Arabistan, what dlfficultioe were made by the British • for the Government. The British Legation entered into negotia tions with the Prime Minister of that time and the War Minister for the purpose of dissuading the Government from the despatch of troops to Khuaistan, and this led finally to strong represent- ations. But fortunately this time their harsh language could not.'^3 contrary to the pa»t, ehake the Govfirmient* s reeolvitjLcn, and tho Legation's claniour could not prevent the despatch of trocps. The dlplomsby of that Governinent, however, i&amp; not destroyed bj such failures; they could not dissuade the ^overnTrent frciri lend ing troops, but they were able easily to butcher this number ofrw in the Eakhtiari territory. The destruction of Z&gt;06 men is of no importance; on the threahold of the greatness and power of Persia we must suffer aiaxx heavier and more bloody sacrlficec. But what plan has the Govermrent thought of to prevent the reouurenoe of such outrages? The slaughter of our soldier broth^ren ia the preface to a voluminouB book ISisk which the EritlBl^fiftiJac^i: rfsBst read for uy» This is a series of measures contemplated by the British Statesmen for the enforcement of that dangerous plan after the fall of VJOBuq-od-Dauleh*s Cabinet and the death of tho Agreement and especially since the last Iff months. Dismemberment of Ferfela. They have been working on this plan for a long time, and their merceneraiies have been doing their best for this purpose in Kordestan, Azarbaijan, the Western province and in the South, After Wosuq-od-Dauleh left for Surope, and,naturally, his policy--a policy brourrht into existence by choking the public opinion, limitirg the Press and deportation and improconcient of men of liberal minds--wsck isst failed, and the reaction of the old policy became apparent in the social atmoaphero,that is,tho public opinion became very vehement against the British diplomacy, persons of deep thought anticipated that the British Governrrert could not regard the destruction of his diplomacy and influence as an ordinary affair, and that she would kit liave resort' to perilous s^chemes. After the fall of Sayyed Zia-od-Dln*s Government and the falling to the ground of the expectations which they might have had of that Government, and particularly when the public opinion left no room for the hope of the remaining of £®ix Armitage-Smith and Col.Smyes, this ' became stronger. w&amp;8 At the same time that the public opinion in Persia/fthowing'' its hatred of the British diplomacy, and at the same time as the question of the disbandment of the S.P.R. and the taking away of- ''nancee from Arm!tag©-Smith and aacjrs* the Army from Siryee, the British Legation antl its mercenary el«mentB were overtaken by a * silence which, more than everything else, i frightened persons of deep thought, 'because they know that such a eilenc^ N was a prelude to a horrible movement, the failure of that Govern- in ^ehran and at the Court ment' s diplomacy/having always Jdxkk ixuesii given rise to violent operations in other regions. This prophecy gradually developed into a fact after the grant of the concession for 611 in the forth to the Standard Oil Co., after the futility of the Britidi KBts Government's noto and espacially after the persistence of the Wajliss,the Government, the political Parties,the Press end particularly the Nationalists against the partnership of the British in the Forth oil. Reports received from £ars,Kurdi Stan, Aza^baiJan and Kermanshah made this diplomacy clearer every day# Mr Chick's visits, to the tribes, Qawam-ol-L f olk* s hostility to Sardar Ashair, Sardar Aqdas's visit to the Bakhtiarl Khans,Foel'p purchase of mules in Luristan, Mr Soane/s publication of a news paper in Kurdistan, ^reenhouse^* s travels in the Western Province the capture of Semitkoc's spies by the Persian Military force in Azarbaijan and their cross-examination, Ifoin-ul-Islam of Behbehan; visit to Behbehan on behalf of Qawam-ol-Molk, his interview with some of the Bakhtiari Khans and the photograph of his letter which haw reached Tehran, have made everythlrg clear and shwed the trend of the British diplomacy. Yesterday one of the effects of that diplomacy was demonstrated in the Eakhtiarl territory. With the appearanco of each of these circumstances we did not fcxip fail to evince our suspicion, and we wrote a few words on the subject figuratively or clearly. But the policy of apathy and indifference which has been recognised as the permanent J? principle of our politicians not paid any attention to them. Tet it is the duty of a pen which is taken in hand for the good of the public that it should not fail to write (facts). Semitkoo will die; the Government troops have commenced their advance, as was expected by us,and,perhaps,in a near futir e this black flag under which these outrages are planned will bo overthrown, but a scheme should be laid for the Semitkoos of the South, Everybody knows that Semitkoo was one of the most■ - r ■and uninp-ortantChief s of Azarlnijin and could, in the- first instance, be suppressed by a military force of 1000 or ^000 men, but the British interests did not aiio^ bin to 0 e destroyed during Wosuq-od-^auj.eh f s Cabinet. He was stored for such a day and was supported to such an extent that we have now to send 10,000 nen to AzarbaiIan. The viping of this bj.aclc stain fcon the SKirt of our natinaiity has invoj-ved us in jfXKitx expenditure of great energy and money. Will the British diplomacy fail to play this role again in th« South? is the Government sure that in the Southern part instead of one Semiticoo there will not be three SemitKoos? \ statesman must be too simple-minded to be so much optimist^ ab 0 ut the present situation in the South. There are such live charcoals in the Couth the frames of which,if touched by the British diplomacy ©n any day, will not^iess injurious than the Conflagration caused, by Se-mitkoo.
