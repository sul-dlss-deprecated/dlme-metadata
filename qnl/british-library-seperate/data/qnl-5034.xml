The appendices are numbered with Roman numerals and are ordered II through to VII, followed by I. Appendices are wrapped in larger sheets of paper, which form a header sheet (labelled ‘C’ with the corresponding appendix number) and rear cover sheet. Within those appendices containing correspondence, the papers are arranged in chronological order, from the earliest papers first, to the latest papers at the end. Summaries of the case (ff 3-11), and papers labelled ‘A’ (f 15) and ‘B’ (f 13) are located at the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 126; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file comprises court papers, including affidavits and exhibits (copies of correspondence, telegrams, invoices, transhipment notes) used in support of an arbitration case brought by M Suleman Versi of Dar es Salaam in Tanganyika, against Ahmed Fakhroo &amp; Bros. of Bahrain.
