                           Muscat News, and a considerable number of translated letters of notable local Omani shaikhs and members of al-Bu Sa‘id ruling family. The correspondence is mainly concerned with the rising of the Imam of Oman, Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi against the Sultan of Oman, Fayṣal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi in 1913, with the cause being the supposed leaning of the Sultan to foreign governments. The Political Agent, Muscat, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, as well as the Sultan of Oman, all raised concerns regarding the threat of attacks on Muscat and Mutrah by the 'rebels'. The Political Resident requested that the Sultan of Muscat issue a notification to the Omani shaikhs not to attack these towns. The Sultan then issued a warning similar to the one which was issued during the rising of the previous Imam in 1895.Among other issues discussed in the volume are:the present situation in various regions including Sama’il, Nizwa, and othersthe possible attacks by Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih al-Harthi and his followers on British subjects in the areas under the Sultan’s controla report (ff 70-73) on the history of the rising of the Imam of Tanuf brought up to 31 July 1913the fall of Nizwa, Izki, Bidbid and Sama’il into the hands of the Imam of Omanthe British assistance to the Sultan by sending troops of 250 men to protect Muscat and Matrahnews of the Imam of Oman collecting zakat (alms) money and pulling tobacco plants from various regions in Omannews that the Imam had been discredited and his followers were quarrelling among themselvesthe death of the Sultan of Oman on 4 October 1913, and the succession of his son Taimur bin Fayṣal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idiAmong other correspondents in the volume are the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, the Imam of Oman, Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi and the Sultan of Oman, Faisal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ghāfirī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sama’il</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Izki</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nizwa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ibadism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Zakat</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Āl Bū Sa'īd dynasty, Imam of Muscat and Oman</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh 'Īsá bin Ṣāliḥ al-Ḥārithī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Maṭraḥ</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000282#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000282#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000282#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000282#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000282#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
