Snouck Hurgonje, in the second volume of his publication
                           Mekkadescribes the place, as well as the festival of ‘Sittanā Mèjmūnah’ in detail.The white-washed low-lying wall – broken only by an arched entryway in the middle – forms an enclosure with two white-washed buildings facing one another. This small cluster of structures is the building visible from afar in X463/7. Both buildings are flat-roofed with rounded crenellations. The building on the right features a low, white-washed onion-dome. Tradition relates that Maymūna requested to be buried at this location, where she married Mohammed.In the left of the foreground rows of awnings cover a long stall beside which people are seated, in the shade. Tents, animals, people and bundles occupy the rest of the foreground as well as the background. Five rocky outcrops are visible in the background along the horizon.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘IXb’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
