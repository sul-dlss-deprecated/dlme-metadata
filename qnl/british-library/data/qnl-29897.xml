C.L. Chauncy, Political Agent, Muscat. * WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OP HIS MAJESTY 1 S POLITICAL RESIDENCY British Residency, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. 28th July, 1951.No. (1041/62) COIJRIDjiirxTAL British Residency, Bahrain. 28th July, 1931. I have the honour to report that I have discussed with I4ajor Chauney your despatch No. IIOjfBA 1033/11) of the 24th July and the enclosed preliminary draft of the new Treaty for negotiation with the Sultan of Lluscat, and that I have very few comments to make. The only point of any importance which I suggest should he further considered is the period for which the new Treaty should re a in in force. It would appear to me tc he to our advantage tliat if the fom of the Treaty as finally negotiated is satisfactory from our point of view this period should he longer than 12 years and I recommend that we should aim at 20 or even 30 years. 2. Apart fro i this, the only suggestions I have to make are the omission of H His Highness” as applied to the Sultan at the beginning and end of the draft as he dislikes the use of this appellation in official documents, and the inclusion of ray first Christian name, William, in the preamble. I assume that in the unlikely event of the negotiations being completed before my return from leave Mr. Felly will be appointed as His Majesty's plenipotentiary. 3. Major Chauney has informed me that the tultan has remarked that he obtains very little advantage from the Treaty and that he considers that if he signs it, he should be given some special concession such as an undertaking for us to supply him with munitions whenever he requires % / them. His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Itoreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London, £&gt;. W« &lt;.them* It is likely, therefore, that we shall be faced with a demand of this nature. Even if we make provision in some of the articles for reciprocal treatment where no such provision exists, this will be of no particular advantage to him as his s*abjects will rarely be in a position to avail themselves of the privileges offered. 4 . I consider that there is little, if anything, in the body of the draft to which the Sultan could object, but he will no doubt study every word very carefully and its negotiation will, therefore, take some time. In the circumstances, I trust it will be possible for you to forward a draft as finally approved with authority to Major Chauncy to negotiate it as soon as possible in order that an endeavour may be made to complete the negotiations before the present freaty as extended expires* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient Servant,No. \ l O . (BA 1053/11) CONFIDENTIAL FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1 . 24th July, 1931 . Sir, ais promised in Mr. Younger’s Despatch No. 19 (EA 1056/2) - of 30 th March 1950 I now forward the preliminary draft of a new Treaty for negotiation with the Sultan of Muscat to replace the- present Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which is due to expire on 11th October after prolongation for eight months from its original date of termination on 11th February 1951. 2. iiS Your Excellency is aware I am proposing that Consular privileges and immunities (article 11 of the present Treaty) and extra-territorial jurisdiction (Articles 13 to 16 of the present Treaty) should be omitted from the scope of the new Commercial Treaty. Mr. Furlonge wrote to you in his letter No. EA 1053/18 of the 1st May about a Consular Agreement and I expect shortly to send you further instructions on this matter. The question of extra-territorial jurisdiction was dealt with in Mr. Furlonge’s letter No. EA 1645/7 of the ?th June. Since these two questions are already being dealt with separately the present draft contains only articles relating to commercial matters. 3. Generally speaking it has been my object to depart as little as possible from the substance of the 1939 Treaty. There are however certain Articles of which revision is unavoidable His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., Bahrain. /owingowing to changes in practice since 1939&gt; the reported views of the Sultan and the fact that the Government of India will not he a signatory to the new Treaty, There are also a number of drafting changes which do not affect the substance of the Treaty, You may, if the Sultan enquires the reason for them, exp].lain that their object is to bring the language of the Treaty into line with the language commonly used to-day in multilateral treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and modern bilateral commercial treaties. While I attach some importance to the adoption of modern usage in this Treaty, I would not wish you to insist on any purely drafting amendments, which caused particular difficulty with the Sultan. I have assumed that since the Sultan has left it to His Majesty s Government to produce a new draft he will be prepared to accept a Treaty drafted in similar terms to the 1939 Treaty, although I appreciate that he may wish for greater reciprocity than is granted to him at present. I have also assumed that the Sultan will be willing to agree that the Treaty should remain in force for the same period, that is, twelve years from the date of entry into force and thereafter subject to one year s notice on either side. In the following paragraphs I propose to comment on the text of the draft Treaty. 4, In accordance v/ith present practice Commercial Treaties concluded by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom no longer contain an article on the lines of .article 20 of the 1939 Treaty and it is therefore left to self-governing countries of the Commonwealth to negotiate separately if they wish. The Governments of Indio and Pakistan have both expressed their intention of negotiating with the Sultan, The 'Accession” Article has therefore been omitted from the draft and references to it and to India have been omitted from the definition of /'territories’'territories of His Majesty’' in paragraph (i) of Article 1.. The definitions in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of Article/1 have similarly been amended to conform to present practice./ 5. The definition of ’’nationals of His Majesty' in paragraph (ii) of Article 1 has been drafted so as to include the nationals of all territories for the international relations of which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are responsible, other than the British Protected States in the Persian Gulf. This does not go as far as the 1939 Treaty v/hich covered all British subjects i.e. citizens of independent Commonwealth countries as well as of Colonies whether or not they acceded to the Treaty, but the new provision has the effect that citizens of a Colonial territory may enjoy the benefits of the Treaty without reciprocity, since they would do so even though the Treaty might not have been extended to their territory under Article 15. This is a point which the Sultan might raise as one aspect of the lack of reciprocity in the Treaty. • Although attempts have been made in the drafts prepared for Treaties with other countries to confine the benefits to persons connected with territories to which the Treaties are extended, no entirely satisfactory formula has at present been found* I should be reluctant to introduce this complication into the Treaty with Muscat and in particular to do so would involve excluding persons such as the Khojas whose citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies is not derived from connexion either with the United Kingdom or any colony. The lack of reciprocity involved in defining 'nationals of His Majesty' to cover citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies British Protected Persons and citizens of Southern Rhodesia arises in respect of all the .articles which give rights to nationals of His Majesty. This arises most obviously on Articles 2 and 12, under which nationals of the Sultan have right which they would not get in a territory to which the Treaty had not been extended although persons connected with that /territoryterritory would enjoy those rights in Muscat. In any case it is probable that the Treaty would be extended to most of the Colonies as in the case of the 1939 Treaty, except any, such as Kenya, in which the obligations under the Treaty would conflict with the policy of the Colonial Government towards /isians. I should therefore prefer not to raise this point with the Sultan unless he himself raises it, in which case I should have to consider a suitable form of words v/hich could be substituted for the jJiresent definition. 6 . The new definition cf the term 'foreign country' in paragraph (v) of Article 1 may seem cumbersomo, but the definition in the 1939 Treaty is no longer appropriate in view of the position of India and Eire. The new definition has been agreed as the best way of dealing with the matter so as to safeguard the preferential treatment given to those countries. It should be noted that if Article 6(1) were to be made reciprocal Burma would have to be added to the list in view of the tariff preferences given by the United Kingdom to Burma. Burmese nationals however are not entitled to any special privileges in establishment matters to v/hich foreigners are not also entitled. 7. The first paragraph of Article 2 has been redrafted so as to give full reciprocity, on the assumption that the Sultan will i no longer be prepared to allow nationals of His Majesty to travel to places in Muscat at their own individual discretion. The last sentence of this paragraph has been revised so as to ensure that any Muscatis who are concerned in trade in or with this country cannot claim exemption from such controls as apply / to British nationals. 8 . The last paragraph of the present Article 3 has been made into a separate Article (4) and a second paragraph has been added to this Article in order specifically to guard against / thethe possibility of the Sultan entering into an agreement with a third country under which cargo is to he carried between the third country and Muscat only in vessels of the former or in vessels of the former and in Omani vessels in specified proportions. Although it might be possible to claim that an arrangement of this kind was contrary to the present paragraph (3) of Article 3, it is considered preferable to provide specif ically against such discrimination which is harmful not only to British shipping but to world shipping as a whole, and in the long run can only increase the cost and reduce the availability of shipping services to world trade. If the Sultan is prepared to accept this new paragraph only on a basis of reciprocity, I would be prepared to grant this in respect of the new Article h* 9. In paragraph (4) (b) of Article 6 the period during which goods may remain in transit pending trans-shipment has been extended to six months since I am advised that the period of three mouths at present provided for is not sufficient to meet normal requirements This ahas necessitated a consequential amendment to the period given in paragraph ( 6 ) of this .article. This Article, in which a number of verbal changes have been made without affecting the substance, may have to be further amended in the light of re-consideration here. 10. I have omitted the present paragraph (3) from Article 7 of the new draft. Otherwise this Article remains the same except that I wish to provide that the classification as well as the value of the goods shall be subject to determination by the impartial experts who may be appointed under the present paragraph (4). I hope that the Sultan will be willing to accept this shortened version of the article, but if he is not prepared to do so it should be possible to draft an additional paragraph providing for analogous treatment for his nationalsthis country. I consider it important however to try and retain in some form the right of impartial review of the value and classification of goods which is provided for in paragraph (3) of the draft Article ?. 11 . modified and can if necessary be made reciprocal. An Article including the principle of this Article is normally found in Commercial treaties and agreements and should be acceptable to the Sultan particularly in view of the revised wording. 12 . I should be glad if, after discussion of the draft with His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat, you will inform me of any modifications which you recommend. As regards the conduct of negotiations I would propose, subject to your views, that Major Chauncy should present the draft to the Sultan end carry out the initial discussions. I understand that a similar procedure was followed in 1939 and in view of your own absence on leave during the period of the negotiations this appears to be most convenient now. It will of course be possible for you to intervene later if required. 13* It will be necessary at some stage to have the dralt translated into Arabic and I should be glad to know whether you consider this need be done before it is presented to the Sultan or whether it can be postponed until the text has been finally agreed as a result of the negotiations. You will notice that in Article 18 it is provided simply that in the case of doubt the English text shall prevail, since if this is to be so it is clearly inappropriate to provide as in the present Treaty that both the English and Arabic texts are 'of similar import and signification'.

Incidentally, the Sultan’s attitude seems to indicate that he is not very interested in a Treaty anyhow - for as he says he gets practically nothing out of it of which he can take advantage, and all he waits as a matter of prestige / if for no other reason, is to ^ put an end to Consular Cnirts. 6 . As regards the drafts, I think the short draft protocol to the Commercial Treaty which I prepared is more likely to appeal to the Sultan than the longer one, and I can tell him that that is based on international custom and usage if there is no suitable Consular Conven tion to show him. 7. In any case unless we are to use threats or pressure to obtain jurisdiction, I can see no advantage in anything hut tackling all these subjects simultaneously - the Treaty - Consular protocol and jurisdiction. I would proo'se to lay our proposals before the Sultan, do my best to argue him into them, and reo ^rt results his counter proposals without any final commitments. Yours sincerely. £. C. J. Pelly Esq, 0. B.E. Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.I visited the Sultan informally at his invitation today on my return from Bahrain where he knew I had been to discuss the drafts for the Treaty. I told him that it was proposed to present for his consideration a draft based closely upon the wording of th old Treaty omitting the provisions for Consuls and for extra territorial jurisdiction, and a draft protocol to the Treaty covering tte appointment of Consuls. Ae regards jurisdicti &gt;n I stated that the intention appeared to be that I should approach the Sultan for a separate agreement to cover this on behalf of India, ^eylon, S.Rhodesia and ourselves and that there would be a single Consular Court for this purpose - India making provision for this in her Treaty which she would be negotiating. The other Commonwealth Countries had not asked for any such approach to be made, Pakistan in particular, who would very likely make their own approach in due course. I added that I expected to receive instructions very shortly now, and that the delay had doubtless been due to the necessity for making enquiries from the Commonwealth, and even now it seemed as if we should not be able to complete negotiations before the expiry of the extended period (October 11th next). The Sultan remarked that he would not be agreeable to any further exteneion of time, and that the position after the 11th October would be that there was no Treaty, and tie Consul would not t en be able to exercise juris diction over British subjects. He was not himself in any hurry mr perturbed X at this prospect, but he felt that • • • there had nowthere had now 'been quite sufficient time, and that it would not he his fault if we experienced any difficulty if there was a hiatus. He di d not contemplate that the Consul would cease to function in any other way in the absence of a Treaty, or any other result than the cessation of extra territoriality ( which is, of course, what he A He did not wish to comnmnt on the proposals in any way until they were laid before him. I I told His Highness that I would telegraph to the Resident that he would not be willing to agree t-&gt; any extension, as in his view there had been ample time: and also that if there was a gap the Consul could not exercise jurisdiction, until or unless this had been agreed to— The Political Agency, Muscat* WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OP HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY.

Chauncy has explained that when/originally suggested a separate consular protocol he had it in his mind that lie would be able to show the Sultan the Anglo-United gtates Consular Convention and that the Sultan would readily accept anything based on it* As the Convention in question has not been finally agreed to, it is not likely to carry much weight with him* I note, however, that in paragraph 3 o? your letter you refer to other consular conventions includ ing one with ..iorway* la there any ratified convention taat can be shown to the Bultan, preferably one with a country of greater Importance than Norway ? 3 . I think it possible that the sultan will jib at an elaborate protocol on the lines of tiiat preus for the inclusion of a simple clause in the Treaty on the lines of Article 11 of the existing Treaty. He could argue tiiat this article has served its purpose very well. I would see no strong objection to this course provided the Sultan undertaxes, preferably in writl ^ but otherwise orally, that our consular officers will enjoy under the new Treaty the same privileges arid immunities as they enjoyed under the old one. 4* The draft protocol will, in fact, if accepted by the Sultan, give our Consulate two privileges which it does not at present enjoy, viz. (a) exemption from municipal taxes for the Consul and his non-local staff, and (b) exemption for all the non—local staff from i*.iport duties The Consul at pi*esent has to pay the municipal tax which ta.:ee the form or a l,o duty on all import 8 .

In the rather primitive conditions prevailing at i.iuscat it will, I think, meet our require ments. It appears to me desirable to include mention of the basic principles covered hy Article 4 whether we retain extra-territorial jurisdiction or not. I regard it as in any case of importance to include a provision v/nicn will make it possible for our Consul to visit our nationals v/hen detained in prison as the Sultan is very reluctant to allow this owing to the bad conditions under which prisoners are usually detained. Other additions to the draft or a separate protocol will be necessary if v/e do not retain extra-territoriality, 6 , A point that has occurred to xae is that neither your draft nor Chauncy 1 s draft appears to make any allowance for His Majesty’s consular Officers to perform consular funct ions in respect of nationals of other members of the Commonwealth such as India*when desired to do so either generally or specifically, and I consider that some provision should be added to permit of this, 7 , I note from paragraph € vC your letter that your draft is entirely a provisional one and it appears probable that some weeks if not months will elapse before you can send us final instructions. Chauncy is anxious to tahe four months* leave from the latter half of September and I con sider it important that he should be allowed to do this as he will then have spent two complete years in huscat. In the circumstances I recommend that we should ask the Sultan to agree to a further six months* extension of the existing treaty. ;7e shall have to apologise profusely if we do this as by October 11th twenty months v/ili have elapsed since the Sultan gave notice of its termination.

(ii) It is understood that, in any case where any Article of this protocolgives a Consular officer the right to perform any functions it is for the sending State to determine to what extent its Consular officers shall exercise such right. Article 6. This protocol shall be subject to the same provisions as regards entry into force, application and termination as the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed between His Majesty and the Sultan on 1951*COPY EA 1053/35 CONFIDENTIAL. /Dear Sir Rupert/ FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 24 July 1951. We have now drawn up a more detailed scheme for the Consular protocol to the Muscat Treaty taking into account the views expressed in your letter No. 1041/51 of the 2nd June. I enclose two copies of this scheme which is based on the corresponding provisions of the Anglo-United States Consular Convention where these are appropriate. 2. The first problem we have come up against is the inclusion of a most-favoured nation pf*evieiene clause. Following the conclusion of negotiations with the Americans we have explained to countries with which we have Commercial Treaties containing most-favoured-nation provisions relating to Consuls, and which have consular officers in British territory, that a Consular Convention would shortly come into force between the United Kingdom and the United States and that we considered it unsatisfactory to regulate the treatment of Consuls on the basis of the application of existing most-favoured-nation clauses to a new agreement with the third country. Ife have also informed those countries with which we should be prepared to conclude a Consular Convention that we should be ready to enter into negotiations for this purpose. 3. In the event the Americans objected to the terms of Article 18 of the Anglo- United States Convention and in the new revised draft they agreed at our request to omit the most-favoured-nation clause from Article $. Such a clause has not appeared in any subsequent Consular Convention. If therefore we include it in the Muscat protocol we fear that other countries might use the precedent as the basis for a claim for continuation of most-favoured-nation Consular provisions in their existing Comnercial or Establishment Treaties with us or for the inclu sion of a similar provision in subsequent Consular Conventions. Both of these are claims we are trying to resist. In this case we consider that in order to obtain all the rights we require we should rely on reciprocity and the inclusion of Article 14. This is based on the Article (32) in the recent Anglo-Norwegian Consular Convention corresponding to Article 28 of the unratified Anglo-United States Convention. It has been expanded to cover privileges as well as functions but it may not be possible to retain the addition, which would in any case probably only be necessary if we retain jurisdiction. We hope that you will regard this as satisfactory but we should be glad to know if you see any objection to proceeding in this way. 4. Iff the discussions about jurisdiction are now to be held before the negotia tions for the Treaty and Consular Protocol, as agreed in your letter No. 16421/9G of the 7th July, we should prefer at this stage not to include in the Protocol the Articles which would be required if we do not retain extraterritoriality. These articles would be inappropriate if we succeeded in retaining jurisdiction and would make the Protocol unnecessarily long and complicated. If we wished to surrender our extra-territorial privileges before the Treaty expired, we could do so in return for specific undertakings from the Sultan to grant the customary facilities to the Consul in jurisdictional matters. 5. You will see that we have proposed to include Articles based on Articles 12 and 13 of the unratified Anglo-United States Convention. We assume that Arti cle 12 will be required almost as it stands but we should be glad to know how much of Article 13 is really necessary. It is a very detailed Article and we feel it may not all be appropriate in Muscat. 6. I should make it clear that the enclosed draft scheme for the Consular Protocol is at present provisional only since there has not been time fully to consider it here. We are however anxious that you should have the opportunity of discussing this question with Chauncy before you leave Bahrain and we are therefore letting you have a draft which contains the results of our present thinking on this subject. We should be glad to have your comments. Yours ever, Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E. , C.S.I. , Bahrain. G.W.

Article 14 (1) All furniture, equipment, supplies, building materials and other articles, including vehicles, marine vessels and aircraft, intended for official use in the territory in connection with any of the purposes specified in para graph (1) of Article 7 shall be permitted entry into the territory free of all taxes or duties imposed upon, or by reason of, importation. (2) Baggage and effects and other articles, including vehicles, marine vessels and aircraft, imported into the territory by a consular officer or employee, provided that he fulfils the conditions specified in paragraph (4) of Article 13, exclusively for his personal use and the use of members of his family forming part of his household, shall be exempt from all taxes or duties (national, state, provincial, municipal, or other) imposed upon, or by reason of, importation, whether accompanying him to his consular post, either upon first arrival or upon subsequent arrivals, or subsequently consigned to him at his post and imported at any time while he is assigned to or employed at such post. (3) It is, however, understood that— (a) the receiving state may, as a condition to the granting of the exemption provided in this Article, require that a notification of any importation be given in such manner as it may prescribe; (b) the exemption provided in this Article, being in respect of articles imported for official or personal use only, does not extend, inter alia, to articles imported as an accommodation to others or for sale or for other commercial purposes. However, articles imported as samples of commercial products solely for display within a consulate, shall not be regarded as excluded from the exemption provided in this Article; (c) the receiving state may determine that the exemption provided by this Article does not apply in respect of articles grown, produced or manu factured in the territory which have been exported therefrom without payment of, or upon repayment of, taxes or duties which would have been chargeable but for such exportation; (d) nothing herein shall be construed to permit the entry into the territory of any article the importation of which is specifically prohibited by law. PART V.—PROTECTION OF NATIONALS Article 15 (1) A consular officer shall be entitled within his district to— (a) interview, communicate with and advise any national of the sending state; (b) inquire into any incidents which have occurred affecting the interests of any such national; (») “Treaty Series No. 22 (1946),” Cmd. 6890 and “Treaty Series No. 26 (1946),” Cmd. 6902. ( 2 ) “Treaty Series No. 26 (1946),” Cmd. 6902. 11 i/12 (c) assist any such national in proceedings before or in relations witlH* the authorities of the territory, and, where necessary, arrange for legal assistance for him. (2) For the purposes of the protection of the nationals of the sending state and their property and interests, a consular officer shall be entitled to apply to and correspond with the appropriate authorities within his district and the appropriate departments of the central government of the territory. He shall not, however, be entitled to correspond with or to make diplomatic claims to the Department of State or the Foreign Office as the case may be, except in the absence of any diplomatic representative of the sending state. (3) A national of the sending state shall have the right at all times to communicate with the appropriate consular officer and, unless subject to lawful detention, to visit him at his consulate. Article 16 (1) A consular officer shall be informed immediately by the appropriate authorities of the territory when any national of the sending state is confined in prison, is awaiting trial or is otherwise detained in custody within his district. A consular officer shall be permitted to visit without delay, to converse privately with and to arrange legal representation for, any national of the sending state who is so confined or detained. Any communication from such a national to the consular officer shall be forwarded without delay by the authorities of the territory. (2) Where a national of the sending state has been convicted and is serving a sentence of imprisonment, the consular officer in whose district the sentence is being served shall, upon notification to the appropriate authority, have the right to visit him in prison. Any such visit shall be conducted in accordance with prison regulations, which shall permit reasonable access to and oppor tunity of conversing with such national. The consular officer shall also be allowed, subject to the prison regulations, to transmit communications between the prisoner and other persons. PART VI.—NOTARIAL ACTS AND OTHER SERVICES Article 17 (1) A consular officer may, within his district— (a) receive such declarations as may be required to be made under the nationality laws of the sending state; (b) issue such notices to, and receive such declarations from, a national of the sending state as may be required under the laws of the sending state with regard to compulsory national service; (c) register the birth or death of a national of the sending state and record a marriage celebrated under the law of the territory when at least one of the parties is a national of the sending state; (d) receive, draw up or execute any declaration, transfer, or other docu ment prescribed by the law of the sending state in connection with the transfer to the register (or documentation) of the sending state of any vessel and its removal from the register (or documentation), and with the transfer of any vessel on the register (or documentation) from one owner to another, and with the registration (or documentation) of any mortgage or charge upon such a vessel; (e) issue passports and travel documents to a national of the sending state and grant visas and other appropriate documents to a person seeking entry into the sending state;13 (/) further the commercial, artistic, scientific, professional and educational interests of the sending state; (g) serve judicial documents or take evidence on behalf of courts of the sending state in a manner permitted under special arrangements on this subject between the High Contracting Parties or otherwise not inconsistent with the laws of the territory. (2) It is understood that consular registration of a birth or death and the recording by a consul of a marriage celebrated under the law of the territory in no way exempts a private person from any obligation laid down in the law of the territory with regard to the notification and registration of births, deaths, or marriages with the authorities of the territory. (3) A consular officer may, within his district, draw up and receive declarations, and may legalize, authenticate or certify signatures or documents, translate documents and perform other notarial acts in connection with docu ments in any case where these services are required by a person of any nationality for use in the sending state or under the law in force in the sending state. If under that law the administration of an oath or affirmation is required, the oath or affirmation may be administered. A consular officer may also perform these functions in connection with documents required by a national of the sending state for use elsewhere, but it is understood that this provision involves no obligation on the authorities of the receiving state to recognize the validity of notarial acts performed by a consular officer in connection with documents required under the law of the receiving state. PART VII.—ESTATES AND TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY Article 18 (1) In any case where a deceased person leaves property in a territory and a legal or equitable interest in such property (for instance, as executor or beneficiary under a will or in case of intestacy) is held or claimed by a national of the sending state who is not resident in the territory and is not legally repre sented there the consular officer in whose district the estate of the deceased person is being administered or, if no administration has been instituted, his property is situated, shall have the right to represent such national as regards his interests in the estate or property as if valid powers of attorney had been executed by him in favor of the consular officer. If subsequently such national becomes legally represented in the territory, the consular officer’s position shall be as if he previously had a power of attorney from the national which has ceased to be operative, as from the date when the consular officer is informed that such person is otherwise legally represented. (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article apply whatever the nationality of the deceased person and irrespective of the place of his death. (3) In any case where a consular officer has a right of representation under paragraph (1) of this Article, he shall have the right to take steps for the protection and preservation of the interests of the person whom he is entitled to represent. He shall also have the right to take possession of the estate or the property unless another person, having superior interests, has taken the necessary steps to assume possession thereof. If under the laws of the territory a grant of representation or order of a court is necessary for the purpose of enabling the consular officer to protect or to take possession of the property, any grant or order which would have been made in favor of the person whose interests are represented by the consular officer, if he had been present and applied for it, shall be made in favor of the consular officer on his application. On prima facie evidence of the necessity for the immediate protection and preservation of the estate and of the existence of persons with an interest which14 1 f i f i the consular officer has a right to represent, the court, if satisfied as to sugfl^ necessity, shall make a grant or an order to the consular officer for the purpose of protecting and preserving the estate, unless another person with equal or prior rights makes the necessary application. ( 4 ) _( fl ) Subject to sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph, the consular officer shall have the same right to full administration of the estate to the same extent as a person whose interest he represents would have had if he had been present. If by the law of the territory a grant by a court is necessary, the consular officer shall have the same right to apply for and to receive a grant on his application as the person he represents would have had if he had been present and applied for it. (b) The court may, if it thinks fit, postpone the making of a grant to the consular officer for such time as it thinks necessary to enable the person represented by the consular officer to be informed and to decide whether he desires to be represented otherwise than by the consular officer. (c) The court may, if it thinks fit, order the consular officer to furnish reasonable evidence of the receipt of the assets by those entitled by law to them or to repay or return those assets to the court in the event of his being unable to furnish such evidence, or it may order that, the consular officer having otherwise fully administered the estate, the actual transmission of the assets to those persons shall be effected through such other channels as it may direct. (5) Where in the territory it is permitted to receive and distribute an estate of small value without first obtaining a grant of representation, a con sular officer of the sending state shall be allowed, without obtaining such a grant, to receive and dispose of such an estate of a national of the sending state in accordance with the laws of the territory. (6) If a consular officer exercises the rights referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Article with regard to an estate, he shall in that matter be subject to the law of the territory and to the jurisdiction of the courts of the territory in the same manner as a national of the receiving state. (7) In any case where it is brought to the knowledge of the local authorities (administrative or judicial) of the territory that— (a) there is an estate in the territory with regard to which the consular officer may have a right to represent interests under the preceding para graphs of this Article; or (b) a national of the sending state has died in the territory and it appears that there is not present or represented in the territory any person, other than a public administrator or similar official, entitled to claim administration of any property which the deceased may have left there, they shall inform the consular officer to this effect. Article 19 A consular officer may receive, for transmission to a national of the sending state who is not resident in the territory, from a court, agency, or person, money or property to which such national is entitled as a conse quence of the death of any person. Such money or property may include, but is not limited to, shares in an estate, payments made pursuant to work men’s compensation laws or any similar laws and the proceeds of life insurance policies. The court, agency or person making the distribution is not obliged to transmit such money or property through the consular officer, and the con sular officer is not obliged to receive such money or property for transmission. If he does receive such money or property, he shall comply with any conditionslaj^wn by such court, agency or person with regard to furnishing reason- t ie evidence of the receipt of the money or property by the national to whom is to be transmitted and with regard to returning the money or property in the event that he is unable to furnish such evidence. Article 20 Money or other property may be paid, delivered or transferred to a consular officer pursuant to the provisions of Articles 18 and 19 only to the extent that, and subject to the conditions under which, payment, delivery or transfer to the person whom the consular officer represents or on whose behalf he receives the money or property would be permitted under the laws and regulations of the receiving state. The consular officer shall acquire no greater rights in respect of any such money or other property than the person whom he represents or on whose behalf he receives the money or property would have acquired if the money or property had been paid, delivered or transferred to such person directly. PART VIII.—SHIPPING Article 21 (1) When a vessel of the sending state visits a port (which includes any place to which a vessel may come) in the receiving state, the master and the members of the crew of the vessel shall be permitted to communicate with the consular officer in whose district the port is situated and the consular officer shall be permitted freely to perform the duties enumerated in Article 22 with out interference on the part of the authorities of the territory. For the purpose of performing any of these duties, the consular officer, accompanied, if he desires, by consular employees on his staff, may proceed personally on board the vessel after she has received pratique. In connection with these duties the master and appropriate members of the crew may proceed to the consular office in the consular district within which the vessel lies, unless the receiving state shall, on its own initiative, object in cases involving unreasonable time or distance of travel. (2) The consular officer may invoke the assistance of the authorities of the territory in any matter pertaining to the performance of these duties, and they shall give the requisite assistance unless they have special reasons which would fully warrant refusing it in a particular case. Article 22 (1) The consular officer may question the master and members of the crew, examine the vessel’s papers, take statements with regard to the vessel’s voyage and her destination and generally facilitate the entry and departure of the vessel. When Custom House brokers or shipping agents are available, the consular officer shall not undertake work normally within the scope of their activities. (2) The consular officer or a consular employee may appear with the master or members of the crew before the local authorities and courts, may lend his assistance (including, where necessary, arranging for legal aid) and may act as interpreter in matters between them and these authorities. These rights may be withheld only in cases where questions of national security are involved. (3) The consular officer may, provided the judicial authorities of the terri tory do not take jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of Article 23, decide disputes between the master and members of the crew, including disputes 1517 a s®fc on dition of entry of such vessel into its ports, and to furnish to the &lt; gcompetent authorities of the sending state such information with regard ^o sanitary or other matters as such authorities may require. (2) In exercising the rights conferred upon him by this Article, the consular officer shall act with all possible despatch. Article 25 (1) If a vessel of the sending state is wrecked in the receiving state, the consular officer in whose district the wreck occurs shall be informed as soon as possible by the appropriate authorities of the territory of the occurrence of the wreck. (2) The appropriate authorities of the territory shall take all practicable measures for the preservation of the wrecked vessel, of the lives of persons on board, of the cargo and of other property on board, and for the prevention and suppression of plunder or disorder on the vessel. These measures shall also extend to articles belonging to the vessel or forming part of her cargo which have become separated from the vessel. (3) If the vessel is wrecked within a port or constitutes a navigational hazard within the territorial waters of the receiving state, the authorities of the territory may also order any measures to be taken which they consider necessary with a view to avoiding any damage that might otherwise be caused by the vessel to the port facilities or to other vessels. (4) If the owner of the wrecked vessel, his agent (or the underwriters concerned) or the master are not in a position to make arrangements, the consular officer shall be deemed to be authorized to make, as agent for the owner, the same arrangements as the owner himself could have made, if he had been present, for the disposal of the vessel in accordance with the relevant provisions of the law of the territory. (5) No customs duties (including other duties imposed upon, or by reason of, the importation of goods into the territory) shall be levied by the authorities of the territory on the cargo, stores, equipment and fittings, or articles, carried by or forming part of the wrecked vessel, unless they are delivered for use or consumption in the territory, but the authorities of the territory may, if they think fit, require security for the protection of the revenue in relation to such goods. (6) No charge (other than customs duties, when they are applicable in accordance with paragraph (5) of this Article) shall be levied by the authorities of the territory in connection with the wrecked vessel, any property on board, or her cargo, other than charges of the same kind and amount as would be levied in similar circumstances upon or in connection with vessels of the receiving state. Article 26 Where any articles belonging to or forming part of a wrecked vessel of any flag (not being a vessel of the receiving state or belonging to or forming part of the cargo of any such vessel) are found on or near the coast of the receiving state or are brought into any port of that state, the consular officer in whose district the articles are found or brought into port shall be deemed to be authorized to make, as agent of the owner of the articles, such arrange ments relating to the custody and disposal of the articles as the owner himself could have made, if— (a) in the case of articles belonging to or forming part of the vessel, the vessel is a vessel of the sending state or, in the case of cargo, the cargo is owned by nationals of the sending state; and (b) neither the owner of the articles, nor his agent, the underwriter, or the master of the vessel is in a position to make these arrangements.18 Article 27 (1) If the master or a member of the crew of a vessel of the receiving stat^* being a national of the sending state, dies afloat or ashore in any country, the competent department of the receiving state shall furnish promptly to a con sular officer copies of the accounts which may be received by it with respect to the wages and effects of the deceased master or seaman, together with any particulars at the disposal of the department likely to facilitate the tracing of persons legally entitled to succeed to the property of the deceased. (2) In every case where the value of wages and effects of the deceased master or seaman, together with any other property of his which comes into the control of the competent department, does not exceed £100 sterling where the competent department is an authority of His Britannic Majesty (or $500.00, where the competent department is an authority of the United States) and the competent department is satisfied that there is any person entitled to succeed to the property of the deceased, otherwise than as a creditor, and that this person is resident in the sending state, the competent department will hand over the wages, effects and property in its custody of the deceased master or seaman to a consular officer. However, the competent department wijl have the right, before handing over, to meet out of the master’s or seaman’s assets under its control any claim against his estate of any person resident elsewhere than in the sending state, which it considers to be legally due. Any claim against the estate of the deceased master or seaman, which is received by that department after handing over, shall be referred to the competent department of the sending state. In the case of His Britannic Majesty the competent department will be the Ministry of Transport of the United Kingdom. In the case of the United States the competent department will be the Federal District Court for the port where the voyage on which the deceased master or seaman died is completed. It is understood that the Treasury Department (United States Coast Guard) will be prepared to receive and transmit to the appropriate court all correspondence from the Ministry of Transport relating to the matters dealt with in this Article. (3) In any case where the competent department does not hand over to a consular officer the wages and effects and other property in its custody of a deceased master or seaman, when the conditions for this purpose stated in paragraph (2) of this Article are fulfilled, the competent department shall, before delivering the assets to any person considered to be entitled to succeed to the property of the deceased, give notice to a consular officer of its intention, stating the person to whom it is proposed to deliver them, in order to give the consular officer a reasonable opportunity to furnish information which may be relevant for the final decision as to the person entitled to receive the property or to the existence of other claims on the estate of which the competent department may be unaware. . (4) The provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article do not apply where the competent department delivers assets in its custody to a person who has obtained a grant of representation from a court in the receiving state, but in this case it shall promptly inform the consular officer to this effect. PART IX.—FINAL PROVISIONS Article 28 (1) The provisions of Articles 15 to 27 relating to the functions which a consular officer may perform are not exhaustive. A consular officer shall be permitted to perform other functions, involving no conflict with the law of the territory, which are either in accordance with international law or practice relating to consular officers recognized in that territory or are actst \ i 19 no objection is taken ^^evy the fees prescribed by the ^services. by the receiving state. A consular officer may sending state for the performance of consular (2) It is understood that, in any case where any Article of this Convention gives a consular officer the right to perform any functions, it is for the sending state to determine to what extent its consular officers shall exercise such right.

I have now received from you instructions on the subject of negotiations regarding extra territorial jurisdiction in Muscat, hut am still awaiting other drafts relating to the new Muscat treaty, X very much hope it will he possible for you to let me have these in the near future so that I can get Chauncy up here and go through them with him before I go on leave. If you can arrange for them to reach rae within the next two or three weeks so much the better as the climate in Bahrain should not be too bad during this period and I should like to give Ghavincy a chance of coming here at a time when he will obtain some relief from the worst part of the Muscat hot weather. In any case, could you kindly give me as much prior notice as possible of the arrival of the papers by telegram so that I can arrange ' for Chauncy to come here accordingly?

I fully agree with him that the Commercial Treaty and the protocol relating to the status of Consuls should, if possible, be drafted as if we exercised no jurisdiction over any eategory of British subjects. Any modifications of the provisions which might be found necessary should the Sultan agree to our exercising * extra-territorial jurisdiction might be included in the exchange / of letters relating to this jurisdiction. 2 . I also agree with most of what Chauncy says in paragraphs pM to 7 of his letter. I am doubtful, however, if we need include 0 any definitions (Article 2 of the unratIfled Anglo-United states I arn doubtful if it is necessary to include anything on ^Convention) and Article 3 of the same Convention might be very much simplified. Generally speaking, the protocol should be at brief and simple as possible. 3* the lines of Article 21 of the Treaty as recommended by Chauncy in paragraph 8 of his latter, but have no knowledge of tha incident to which he refers. 4 . JSie period of prolongation of the existing treaty expires on the 11th October ao that we tore &amp; little more than months left in which to negotiate with the Multan. I horn?, therefore, you will be able to let me have complete drafts of the new treaty and the documents which are to accompany it ©e soon as possible so that I can go through them with Chauncy with a view to his starting negotiations with the Sultan as soon as possible after the 5th tfuly when the month of fast is due to end. ^ feW.

I see no ham in making the approach proposed but consider that it has no chance of success. I would suggest that the Government of India should be asked to put their request into writing stating the exact form in which they suggest it should be passed on to Sultan and to send it to me or Chauncy as representing their interests in Muscat for communication to him in writing. If it is considered more proper that the Government of India letter should be addressed to the United Kingdom High Commissioner and passed through the usual channels, I should see no objection, but I consider it desirable that when the Sultan is addressed it should be made clear that the communication is being made under instructions received from the Government of India. 2 .

Ifly inmediately preceding telegram. The Sultan has pointed out that any attempt to amend or raodiffcj the old Treaty must complicate the position for him. There are only two High Contracting Parties, namely Kis i«lajesty the King and himself. If they agree to prolong tie Treaty that should be sufficient, and, as far as he is concerned, the issue with regard to India will not arise. T1 ey only arise if we draw attention to them by any attempt to amend the Treaty, which, anyhow at this stage, seems unnecessary. If we w»-.*re doubtful about our ability to speak for India, now we have that Government’s authority, but he is hr'mself not concerned with it, andjrequires only prolongation of the 1939 Treaty by agreement of the High Contracting parties named ^ in it. fc 2. I have explained our reasons for existing drafts, but Sultan finds it impossible to see the position in that light, and feels strongly that his present proposals for notes are adequate for present purposes,// and more correct, in his view, than our proposals. 3* I appreciate that K*M.G. may find the strictly legal position difficult to accept but recommend Sultan's proposals should be agreed to if possible, as I am convinced that we stiall find no embarrassment in their working during the period involved.

In fact this means only that the term “territories of His Majesty' as defined in Article I(i) of the Treaty is modified so as to exclude India. This term, or its equivalent, “territories of the one (or the other) High Contracting Party 1 ’ in relation to His I ajesty, occurs in Articles 2, 5* 8, 9* 11&gt; 12 and 17 of the Treaty but the modification does not affect the reciprocal most favoured-nation treatment provided for in Article 21 • The remaining definitions in Article I paragraphs (ii) , (iii), (iv) and (v) are unchanged and thus the exercise of jurisdiction over Indians, as over all 'nationals of nis Majesty”, is unaffected, The above may be explained to the Sultan if he wishes. 3* I should be glad if Your iXcellency will in due course forward to me the originals of the notes which are exchanged* I am, with great truth and respect.

U I forward herewith another letter from Chauncy about the Muscat treaty, which unfortunately I had not seen when I v/rote my letter 2 , 0 . 60 / 30/50 of the loth December. 2. I have already suggested that the question of jurisdiction should be covered by a separate ex change of letters. 3* I believe it has already been decided not to propose a separate Consular Convention to the Sultan, but to insert a few clauses in the new Treat of Comm erce and Navigation covering all that is required from our point of view. I am not sure on 7/hat grounds this decision v/as reached, but I would suggest for consider ation that now that v/e have plenty of time, we might ask the Sultan which course of action he would prefer. If this proposal is accepted, there will presumably be no objection to us allowing him the Anglo-United States Consular Convention. L. A.
