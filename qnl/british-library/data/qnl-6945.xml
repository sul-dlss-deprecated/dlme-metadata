Phe history of Najd during the last 200 years has been a stormy one, but the dynasty of fbn Sand has, with occasional short breaks, maintained itself on the throne since about 1700 a.d., when Saud L, the ancestor from which the royal lamuy derives its name, established himself in the Central Highlands of Arabia as an independent baron. Central Arabia was at that time divided' up into a number of semi-mdependent principalities owing a vague allegiance to the King of Hasa on the i-nn 8 0f i ^ 1 ^ rsia11 GuU &gt; aild the position of Saud and his successors between JNUU and i/oO a.d. was not unlike that of their contemporary Rob Rov in the Scottish Highlands between the powerful duchies of Argyll and Montrose. ' The affairs of Arabia underwent a striking change about the year 1759 a d a IT a 1 ppear ? d the scene the Sunder of the Wahhabi sect, Mohammad Ibn AbdulW anhab, wjth whose co-operation Muhammad, the fourth of his line, established himself as the ruler of a new religious state which by dint of force or persuasion rapidly engulied not only the various principalities of the interior, but also the oiiginal suzerain power ol Hasa. liy 1790 a.d . Saud 111., the son and successor of Muhammad, was master of all Central and Eastern Arabia. The spread of the Wahhabi doctrines and the military successes of the new State alarmed the Turks who now took active steps to ward off the threatened danger; and vvf i i 63() years a . state ^ war existed between the Ottoman Empire\nd the W ahxiabi Kuler. At first fate favoured the latter, who extended his conquests on every side, captured Mecca in 1803, Madina in the following year, and the territory of Oman soon after, sacked the sacred city of Kerbela on the borders of Mesopotamia, raided Basra and Damascus, and in short brought under his sway practically the whole of Arabia. But the Turks persevered ; Saud III. died, his successor, Abdul Aziz IL, was assassinated and the throne of Najd fell to Abdullah, whose dilatory tactics in face ol Muhammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt,- and his sons, resulted in the dramatic collapse of the great empire which he had inherited. In 1818 a.d ., Ibrahim Pasha captured the Wahhabi capital, Daraiyya, after a four months' siege, massacred many members of the royal family, and the religious luminaries of the Wahhabi sect, and sent Abdullah himself in chains to Egypt, where he was executed. For the next 30 years Central Arabia had a sufficient experience of Turkish rule ; at frequent intervals revolts headed by members of the Ibn Saud family, which had escaped the massacre of Daraiyya, met with a greater or less measure of success, but Najd did not recover its complete independence until Faisal, the grandson of Abdullah, escaped from Cairo and recovered the throne between 1840 and 1850 a.d. Najd now enjoyed a period of comparative peace, but on the death of Faisal about 1869, his two eldest sons, Abdullah and Saud, plunged the country into civil strife in their struggle for the throne. Each occupied it in turn for short periods and Abdullah invited the assistance of the comparatively new dynasty of Ibn Rashid in a final effort to establish himself permanently on the throne ; but he reckoned without his host, for Muhammad Ibn Rashid, having defeated and slain Saud, deposed his ally Abdullah and took the throne of Najd for himself. For a decade or more the Ibn Sand dynasty lay dormant, while its surviving remnants lived in exile at Bahrain and Kuwait rather than serve a foreign ruler in their own territories. Abdullah had left no children, but Saud had left a considerable family, and a third son of Faisal, by name Abdul Rahman, survived to live.in retire ment at Kuwait with a large family of growing boys. The duty of recovering Najd was never forgotten; many attempts were made without success by both branches of the family, and at the beginning of the -0th century, Najd being still in the hands ro 162 20 10/19of 11)11 IvilS hid \bdiil Rahman formally abaicato.1 all claim to the throne in favour of ma, auuhi lAciu i - l ie delegated the duty of recovering Ibu Saud, to whom his eldest son Abdul Aziz t ' le iSe^nt^of^A-P.' Alxlul Aziz, (hen a yonng man of only 19, left Kuwait with ^fo lowing of 200 men ; having arrived at a distance of a day s journey from Rivadh he selected 15 men to accompany him and entered the capital secretly. Ihe Qc^ernoi was ambushed and killed in the ma.n square and R.yadh acclaimed be return o its rightful lords. Abdul Aziz then recovered piecemeal the whole of the territorv, which Faisal had ruled, and in the spring ol 1914 wrested the rich province of Hasa from the Turks by a stratagem Rivadh. as bold as that by which he had captured the war be co-operated with the Mesopotamiau authorities as far as bis isolated position permitted, both in the blockade ul enemy teniloiv and in keeping up pressure on the enemy, Ibn Rashid, thus enabling the King of the Hejaz to develop his military operations along the railway without fear of serious interference from Ibn Rashid. in September 1918 he began a vigorous offensive against Hail itself and had gained an initial success, when the signing ol the armistice with I uikey icndered the continuance of his operations unnecessary. The relations between our two allies, the King of the llejaz and I bn Saud, have never been very conlial and were becoming increasingly strained during the last months of the war, but Ibn Saud gave us, and faithfully carried out, an undertaking that he would do nothing to increase the King's difficulties so long as he was engaged in co -operating with our military forces. After the war matters rapidly grew more serious until they culminated in open hostilities last May, in the course of which Ibn Sand's forces made a surprise attack on the King's camp, and captured all their guns, machine guns, ammunition and uther impedimenta. So far as can be ascertained only 150 men of the King's ragular army escaped from the slaughter, in which between 4,000 and 5,000 men are said to have perished. Ibn Saud then returned to his capital and the peace has not since been disturbed. At the invitation of His Majesty's Government Ibn Saud lias sent a delegation to pay homage to His Majesty and to congratulate him on the successful issue of the war. The delegation is headed by his second surviving son, Faisal, a boy of 14, who took part in the military operations against Ibn Rashid in 1918. He is accompanied in the capacity of political adviser by his cousin, Ahmad Ibn Thunaiyan, whose grandfather sat on the throne of Xajd for a brief space during the troublous years of the Turkish occupation and who was himself, with his brothers, educated at Constanti nople ; bis brothers were at Constantinople on the outbreak of war and served in the Turkish army. The commercial interests of Najd are represented by the third member of the delegation, Abdullah A1 Qusaibi, a partner of a flourishing firm of pearl and general merchants at Bahrain. The remaining three members of the delegation are attendants. A treaty was signed in 1916 by Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E.. K.C.S.I., on behalf of Great Britain and by Ibn Saud, whereby the latter in return for a British guarantee of the integrity of his territories undertook to have dealings with no foreign Power but (rreat Britain, to keep open the pilgrim routes across his territory to Mecca and to lefiain from aggression against the Persian Gulf states in treat} 7 * relations with us. t was also agreed that ihe actual boundaries of his territories should be determined a u ^ ^ll, an ^ ^ ^ ^ ie treaty then ratified should be revised with a view to the establishment of a permanent agreement between Ibn Saud and the Power which he regan s as lis natural protector.
