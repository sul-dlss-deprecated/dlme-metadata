No. 207. Political Agency, Kuwait. Dated the 10th April 1930. From To Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.S., Political Agent, Kuwait. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Eushire. Municipality for Kuwait. F Sir, I have the honour to report that for some time past I have been quietly trying to induce the Shaikh to introduce some form of municipal and sanitary control in Kuwait. 2. As you doubtless are aware we have neither light ing arrangements nor control of any sort in the town except in the Bazaar where at night a dozen watchmen patrol the area where the shops are. 3. Such matters as sweeping of streets, removal of refuse, repairs of roads, lighting of streets etc etc are conspicuous by their absence. And as an old citizen of the town once remarked to me w God alone takes care of the cleanliness of our town, for with our sandy soil and a strong | sun He does everything that is necessary”, 4. I am glad to report that at long last the Shaikh has moved in the matter and has set about tackling the subject. 5. He visited me on the 9th.instant and exploded the bombshell, that he had that morning ordered a proper Muni cipality or Belladiyeh to be set up and had given Rs 5000/- out of his privy purse as a loan, to assist in starting the necessary machinery. H© emphasized that to commence with he would not go too fast,’ lest he put Public opinion against the scheme, but that gradually he hoped to have something — :somothing worth^of c?o'*uparison witii Bahrain. This incident ally is what I have been preaching day in and day out for xh the last 6 months. 6. The new municipality council consists of:- Paid members. A Rais-i-Balladiyeh A Secretary A Mudir and ) 10 of the leading citizens of the town.)Honorary ) members. and at the moment of writing municipal 'rules’ 1 are being drafted, and arrangements are ,T en train' for engaging road menders, sweepers, removing of refuse, providing of lights and the numbering of houses. 7. Taxation has not yet been finally approved of, but the Shaikh has adopted my suggestion that the monthly 1 ■ i house tax should consist of Es 1/-, Rs Rs -/4/- and Rs -/2/- in accordance with the size of the house. This until the people get used to the scheme when it will t probably be slightly raised. There will also be a tax on boats, shops, slaught er houses, motor cars and an 'Arthiyeh' or ground tax for those selling their wares on the ground or in booths in the market place. 8. For the moment the Shaikh is veiy enthusiastic, and he is supported by the best elements in the town^and while it is early yet to say whether the sbheme will finally succeed, I am in hopes that a start having been made (which is everything in the Bast) progcess will be steady. In this matter Kuwait has the advantage of being close to Basrah and its leading citizens own much house property in that town, and are used to paying taxes. These persons have seen and daily see how wonderfully Basrah has improved and is continuing to improve under a vigorous municipal and health policy and the tales they bring and the unconcious propaganda they spread is having its effect. I for my part am contenting myself with advising . / while keeping myself in the back ground. The experience I gained in ’Iraq where I introduced 4 municipalities, and the lesson in 'going slow' which I learned when I introduced fintroduced the Municipality in Bahrain in face of extra ordinary opposition^, is of assistance to me now, 9. A further progress report on the subject will be submitted in due course by me. In the meanv/hile it will I think be of great encouragement if you could see your way to write a congratulatory letter to the Shaikh and say how pleased you are to hear of his having taken the right decision and introduced the much needed Municipality into Kuwait, and that you hope that every effort will be made to take it a success and Kuwait an eventual rival of Bahrain. i I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col. / Political Agent, Kuwait., r V-' • ( o a j % 1/ Confident ial. D.0.No.S.O. ///I Secretariat of H.E.the High Commissioner for »iraq, Baghdad, dated ^August, 1932. CsW-fi. please refer to correspondence ending with my demi-official letter No.6029 dated the 18th of July, 1932, about the TOiwait Power Station. Toller has now brought to me an ’Iraqi Christian named Mr.Yusuf (J.D.) Messayeh who says he is prepared to put up the capital. He is the owner of a large araq distillery near Baghdad. He is recommended by Bassett, the ’Iraq Government analyst who has had dealings with him in the past. I have obtained two bank references about him. one says his morality is good and means medium (i.e .-2 a l arrn to 2 lakhs) : the other that his character is fair and means £16,000 including the distillery and house property. There was a big fire in the distillery a year or two back under suspicious circumstances and he cashed Hs.1,20,000 insurance. He has just w 0 n a case in the Court which shuts his quondam partners out of the araq business. in brief, he is a clever, but apparently respectable, old gentleman. 2 # Before sending an agent to Yuwait to apply for* « J' - 2 - for the Electric power concession he has ashed me whether it would 'be possible to obtain i or him the following information:- (a) u ow far are the original concessionaires still interested ? Is there any possibility of dispute with them regarding the validity of any new concession ? (b) It is understood that the contract runs for 30 years. What security is offered over this period ? To what court or authority will the concessionaire have the right of appeal in case of dispute ? (c) Has any estimate of the demand been prepared to indicate both what output is required of the plant and whether it is likely to be a paying proposition 2 Mr.Messayeh would also of course be very grateful for any advice you may care to give him on the subject and in particular asked whether the fact that he is a Christian would be likely to weigh against him in Wuwait.

Secre ta:riat of H.E.the Hi^h ^.O.Ko.S.O. ta.Crt&gt; Commissioner for^jjraq, Baghdad, dated /^^eptemher, 1952 Reference your demi-official letter ^o.l47 dated the 26th of August, 1932, and the TTuwait Power Station scheme, this is to let you know that Cunningham, who has shed light over Baghdad, first as Manager of the Royal Air Bcrce Power station, and later with the Electric Light Company, for a considerable number of years, has now severed his connection with tne latter, and is about to set up as a Consulting Electrical Engineer on his own. T know of nothing against Cunningham, and, indeed, have always heard well of him. 1 gather that he is leaving the Baghdad Electric Light Comnany because he finds that he cannot get satisfactory terms out of the 'Belgian ^Directors. However, Joi s may be, he has come to me to ask about the vuwait scheme He says that, if, on enquiry, prospects seem favourable, he proposes to apply for the concession in conjunction with Abdeni, (agent here for Betters: vide enclosure to my demi-official letter Bo.6029 dated the 18th of July, 1932). He assures me that this would mean that Petters would get the business. I understand, by tne way, that Abdeni saw the Shaikh of Truwait when he was here the other day, but did not get much change out 0 f- 2 - him. vusuf ^'essayeh, meanv^hile, will r^tir^ xnto the haclc^round, until the question o r supplying capital arises, iriiile Toller scene to have been edged out altogether. I told Cunningham that I could give him no detailed information and advised him, if he seriously considered the proposition, to go to Kuwait, and investigate it for himself. This he proposes to do within the next few weeks, armed with a letter of introduction to you. ^ 2 # i hone T am not 'being a nuisance to you with these people. But I expect they would apply to you for help in any case, so that it sesrns as well to let you 'know about them beforehand. ' r ieutenant-Colonel TT.H.P.T)iclcson, C.I.B.» Political Agent, Kuwait.

He said ttiat the Iraqi was employed temporarily and that he would soon be replaced by a Kuwaiti or British Indian. No change took place and on the 7th ^ugust I again spoke to the Ruler. He told me that to see an Iraqi employed in Kuwait2 Kuwait was 'like a stab in the heart' to him. He was the fird to wish for another, I asked, him if I could help him by selecting an Indian Engineer while in India on recess. He said not. The iileetrio Light Company themselves would like to write to India about a man. 7* I did not press the matter, because I felt it would place us in a better position next autumn to deal with the matter of this appointment, if not by then filled by a Kuwaiti or British or British Indian Subject.

The eiaployraent of &amp; German here, particularly after the warning conveyed in the reports from the LJaval Intelligence Staff, Colombo, was of course most undesirable, and the shaikh was pressed to replace him, but I doubt if the removal of an Iraqi from employment by a private company is worth the irritation which would be caused by pressing for his removal. 4 . The shaikh has agreed verbally to the principle you mention, and I wonder if it is not better policy to stand there on our gains so far. I am swayed towards this alternative policy by the fact that the electric Light sompany is badly run. Good money has been thrown away on second hand German machines and trying to repair them. The current is L/C, which will of course soon be inadequate to suppoj. t all the va_L ious calls upon it, and the company will have to change to A/C at much expense. A foreign company, I hope Britisn, wilx ha . e to dh called in to advise and install the new plant. I have, in k 7\ m - 2 - in this connection, already had a few words with Kohlers (■British) representative in India, which firm employes British Indians, and who is prepared to send an ayent here, on a hint from me, th t it may be worth while. The Direction will or should then be taken over by the Kuwait Grovernment. 6. /hen the breakdown comes, as it must within a year or so, it will be useful to have the Iraqi Director and his mechanic as scapegoats. That is, I believe, also the Shaikh’s view. 7. If we vet rid of them now, anc the breakdown takes place under Kuwaiti and British Indian direction, thqy may come back with renewed vi ;our - pointing out to the municipality and the people that all went well in their time - to obtain the agency for the supply of the engines, and the continuance in the Direction of the Company even if we insist on no Iraqi being employed. 8. In the above circumstances, now outlined, and which I had not previously explained to you, which course do you wish nie to pursue? : - (a) ’pressure', vide your letter iIo.725-S of the 21st October, 1907; (b) reservation of pressure for future use when the breakdown, which a more competent technical observer than I, the Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company, regards as certain, comes.
