It is for the Company to appoint a Chief Local Representative and as a matter of local convenience it is desirable that an individual should be nominated as soon as possible. 5. If it is the intention of the Company to t appoint Mr. Packer as Chief Local Representative (which I imagine it is), I would suggest that they should be asked to expedite their proposal for His Majesty's Government's approval. 6 .

We notice that Major General G.G.

The A-I-O.C. report a certain restlessness on the part of the Shaikhs concerned at our inaction in respect of geological surveys, etc., « since the options were obtained, and, in consequence, a distrust of fresh negotiations for an extension of such options lest these should lead to a further period of inactivity. Moreover, the Shaikhs would like to be given some idea of the oil value of their territories before embarking upon fresh negotiations relative thereto. In these circumstances I am proposing to send out two British Geologists to do some reconnaissance work towards the end of the year, and to open at Bahrein in September, or October, a central office for all the Trucial Coast work. The most likely man I have on the staff for appointment as Manager of this central office is Mr. E.V. Packer, M.B.E., who has served the Iraq Petroleum Co. as representative at Amman (Transjordan) during the past four years. I enclose copy of the particulars of himself which he submitted when he applied for employment; I took up references and found them very good; I can confirm that his service with the I.P.C* has been entirely satis factory; my first choice has fallen on him because of the smooth relations which he has established with the Arabs of Transjordan, with whom he is in favouf. COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL2 In compliance with my promise to obtain your prior approval to the nomination of the Local Manager, would you kindly cause enquiries to be made in regard to the suitability of Mr. Packer as a tactful liaison man, and let me know if I may confirm the appointment. I feel sure that the British Resident at Amman, Colonel Cox, will give him a good chit. In regard to the reconnaissance work to be undertaken by the Jeologists, they will be instructed to observe such restriction of movement as will oe laid down by the Political Resident.
