First of all however he feels bound to pay unqualified tribute to efforts of British officials in Mesopotamia and Koweit to assist him. He then discribes briefly eighteen cases wnich have aaaajiiBii occured during last three months in order to show that rebels are receiving assistance and encouragement from Koweit and Iraq and from King Feisal himself and that constant comraunicationsjpass between 1 ' ile ^ ^ ■ Eashdpd anti 311 tiie rebels? all this is cont^ to undertakings of British Government witliout their consent.

Intelligence - situation in Hassa &amp; Hejd. Sir, In continuation of my No*5^7 dated iDth. September 1^2y and my telegram II0.542 dated 21st September 1^29, I have tne honour to report a very interesting conversa44 tion with Shaikh Hillal al Mntairi which I had yester day the 2^rd September lyZJ. This individual as you know resides in Kuwait and is probably the wealthiest man in the Persian Gulf to- dayo He maintains, at all times, the closest touch with Nejd, and more particularly with Faisal al Duwish and Ibn Ashwan the two most important Rebel Leaders&lt;, With the former because of a life long friendship between them, and with the latter because Ibn Ashwan is the head of Shaikh Hillal»s own tribe the Matair (Braieh) 2. Shaikh Hillal ax Mutairi's knowledge of affairs in central Arabia generally, and especially his know ledge of Desert politics and the things that the great Bedouin tribes are thinking of and discussing, is in my opinion unique, and being a man of yo years old with mind still active and strong, whatever he has to say is usually tempered witn Judgement and common sense. i in politics Shaikh Hillal is a Uutairi trioes- mvx first, secondly a Kuwaiti pearl merchant and loyalsubject of tlie ai subaJio Lastly Jae is, and always Has 'been an anti-Bin Saudite and as such his sympa thies are entirely with the Eebels. Being however, as I said above a man of long views and clear pers pective, his appreciations of situations are nearly always sound* 4o Shaikh Hillal arrived from his estates on the Shatt al-Arab on 2lst September lyzy where incidentally he received on Ibth September 1^2^ as visitors Mutrij ibn Hijna (Ataiba) and Hihan ibn Marwi (Mutairi) both resident in TransJordan. These individuals according to the Special Service Officer Basrah 1 s report NOol/BS/l dated JJ/th September 1^2^ paragraph (a) brought letters from Abdullah al Misfir, who holds an important position in the palace at Y/' Baghdado The^e would appear to be a connection between the visit of these men and items of news mentioned in paragraph 6 below. 5, In his conversation witn me Shaikh Hillax imparted the following information which is given below in the form of sub-paragraphs# (a) Azaiyiz the son of al Duwish was un doubtedly killed at Um el iludhumma but with him not more than 2^0 men. The incident is looked upon as a regrettable » incident and will in no way affect the plans of al Duwish, (b) Al Duwish had mobilized the Aj^an and Mutair and was at the moment of writing moving South against the Awazim. Al Duwlsn nad deliberately allowed tne Awazim to hear of his movements in order to convey the impression that ne intended-5- attaoking tJien anyofee^- iiow,, They, the Awazim, with their allies and Bin Saud f s regulars (Sarraya) in all ajfcout 2^00 strong had formed a camp surrounded by tranches and defensive posts North-East by East of Fba^ and were to all intents and purposes awaiting the coming attack* (c) Duwisii f s plan however was not to attack at all. Having got the Awazim concentrated witn all their camels and sheep in a small area, he was going to surround them by a ring of camps distant four to five miles away, and force them either to come out of their trenches and attack him, or surrender. The large number of camels and sheep with the Awazim was their weakness, and would help force an^ early deeisiono These required to be grazed and as soon as they quitted camp, Paisa^s plan was that they should be attacked and rounded up&lt;&gt; The superior strength of the Akhwan forces would enable them to adopt these tactics. (d) A1 Duwish hoped for a complete surrender in a matter of 4 to 5 days by these methods; the only danger being that the Awazim ?&gt;rould 't-umble 11 to the plan before the door was closed to them, and would escape south to the Qatif or Huffuf oasis. (e) There was little chance of the Awazim moving over to the Akhwan side voluntarily as did the Braih, as theirs was a tribe originally subject to the Ajman, whom Bin Saud had fafceed from bondage and giventiie status of an independant tribe. lncl&gt;—- dentally tJiis was iiow Bin Saud Jb.ad won the Awazim over to his side from their former allegiance to Kuwait. The Awazim would lose their freedom once more if they threw in their lot with the rebels now and would again have to pay 'idiawa 11 to their old lords the Ajman. (f) Having accomplished his object of either forcing the Awazim to surrender or compel ling them to retire south, ai Duwish 1 s next move would be to leave the Ajman masters in Hassa, and move with all his Mutair forces to Artawiyeh. here ne would establish his baseband striking South West would seize the Sudair and Washm provinces and cut off Eiath from tne rich province of Qassinu (g) Tne operation would not be difficult as Bin saud definitely had no troops (regular or tribalJ in the field except the Awazim &amp; their allies, &amp; the force under Ibn M f saad at Ajibba. There was nothing at all at Hafar al Atz or Awania (South of Fta) as reported in different quarters so per sist antly. (h) As regards Qassim itself, the rebel leader^ al Dahaina was definitely alive &amp; well, and going from success to success. He had already established relations with the townspeople of Anaiza and was receiving all the supplies he required from that quarter.(i) Hecent letters from al Dliaiiia to al Duwisil were reported that ail was going well witJa iiim in passim, in spite of a temporary set back caused Dy tiie report spread oy Bin Saud that H&amp;ssa and Kuwait nad oeen taJ£en over by the English, and that the A&amp;hwan attached in rear were in extremis. This report for a snort time nad created some thing of consternation in the ranks of tne Ataioa insurgents, but the truth was now known, (j) It was perfectly true that Bin saud nad possession of all the towns in hassa, IJejd and Qassim today, but as far as Qassim was concerned this would not help him much as the inhabitants would be compelled to come to terms with tne rebels who nad it in tneir power to ruin all agriculture, gardens etc lying outside the town areas« As everywhere irrigation was by 'lift' from wells and as camels were the means used, these only had to be driven off by the Akhwan and all ir rigation would come to a standstill., Al Unwisn was perfectly aware of this fact, &amp; once at Artawiyen he intended to force Qassim to declare for him by means of this form of pressure, bo Shaikh Hillal next confided to me the following which he described as ' most secret ' x^efUsing to divulge tne source ne nad got it from. He added that ne could not definitely assure me, that what he said would 'come off' or turn out to be true, but that ne believed that something on the lines of what is described below was being pxanned and would be attempted.Tiie infonaation ne imparted was (a) Tiiat King Hussain would sliortly come to Bagiidad from Cypurs for Jiis JiealtJi. (b) Tiiat Nuri al SJiaalan and tne Hualla, would sliortiy start hostilities against Bin Saud and attacli Jauf. (oj Tnat snammar Jar Da under Ajil al Yan^ar were arranging for a general move SoutJi of all SJiammar elements in 1 Irac^ witia a view of recover iiail for tiae ar-Easciiid family® Tliat tuiougli all members of this family were state prisoners in Eiatii, tiiere remained^junior member of tne family at large to whom it was intended to offer the chieftainship temporarily, (who this is is not clearj. (d) That several prominent Shammar Shaiiihs were already at Baghdad arranging details of the above plot, and that the recent movements of messengers between Baghdad and al-Duwish's headquarters were all to do with this piano (e) Finally that Duwish had agreed to get into touch with loyal Shammar elements still in § Hejd and try and win them over also* y o I have given the above in detail, for coming from a man of Hillal al Mntairi f s calibre, it is worth taking note of. As far as the information given in paragraph 5 goes, I personally believe Hillal al Mutairi has given me correct news which he has received direct from ax- Buwish and his agent^^-h passim. The report about ai Dahaina's successes nas been confirmed by tne Shaikh of Kuwait also^and I think we may assume things are not going too well with Bin Saud in Hejd, though the report that Bin Saud cannotleave Hiatii, sliouxd be accepted witii reserve. As regards tJie 'very secret' news given in parE- grapii b. I prefer to mane no comments, tlioiigJi it is % not improbable tiiat S-iiereefian elements wnerever found will endeavour to furtner any plan tJiat wixl embarrass Bin saud.

September His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad also reported this morning that a Shaikh Trad ibn Sattam al Shaalan of Anaze (Syria) had arrived in Kuwait yesterday and had called on him. He had not divulged the reason of his visit yet, but it was obvious he came with a message for al-Duwislu Paragraphs (i) and (2) above read in connection with. Hillal al Mutairi's statement as reported in paragraph b of my letter referred to above illumina ting, I think. 4. During his talk with, me His Excellency said he was afraid things were going to get worse for Bin Saud before long, and if the latter did not make a very big effort 192^0:■ | effort soon, He feared a ^serie/s of new enemies would arise and join Duwisb. against hinio Wlien I asked who these were, ShaiHh ^aad replied that he had had it from Ali s - jl Shuwairbat when he passed through a few days ago, that King Faisal had secretly sent for all the Sharmnar refugee Shaikhs to Baghdad - vide Kuwait Diary Ho,iy paragraph i&gt;b - including Ajil al Yawar CShammar Jarba) and Agab ibn Ajil CShammar Ahda), and had called them cowards for not rising against Bi 11 Saud and Making themselves masters of Eail, that the time was now ripe for action^ and if they did not move they deserved to be slaves for all time. That when the Shammar Shaikhs excused themselves pleading their fear of al-Duwish, he the King had said, 'Have no fear, I have arranged things with al-Dwish ( 1 lat khafun Duwish andhi 1 }'. They then replied that they would not move till the cold weather set in and that if in the meantime ^in uaud did not b^ing about a change in the situation, they the Shammar would act and thjuow in their lot with the in— / surgentso gis Excellency said he had not paid much at- \ tention to the above as he thought rather lioellous story, at the time, but that it had now been corroborated by Hillal al Mutairi, iB. rather remarkable fashion . Shaikh Ahmad then proceeded to tell me exactly what Hillal had reported to me as u most secret' information* (vide paragraph b of my No.54b). ^ ■pj.Qm the above there would appear some reason to suppose that al-Duwish is in touch with tne Sheer- ifian party and is making efforts through them to get Shammar and Anaze to come in as allies by oftering them Hail and Jauf respectively. v His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad is, it would seemseem,Df tue alcove opinion also, iDiiti is obvionsXy 08.111310113 about stating liis views. He made one curious remark bo me, wliicli is wortii recording.

The opinion ot King Feisal, which is shared 'by Abdullah whom I met. at Ajmnan, and also, I understand from the Political Eesident in the Persian Gkiir hy the Shaikh of Koweit, is that the authority of ihn Saud is on point of collapse. The personal attitude of King, Faisal is that, apart from his own feelings, this would in fact 'best suit the interests of Iraq:. He argues that an effective union of the fanatical trihes of central Arabia cam only 'be maintained hy the policy of constant aggression agafst 0 neighbouring atates. If disunited, the tribes would expend their energies on local disputes and the frontier of Iraq., covered by friendly Sham mar, would be secure.

Jrom letter and messenger's report battle tooic place at dawn on Saturday 5th October and ended in signal victory for AJchwan. This was mainly due to heavy and well sustained onslaught of Mutair from north after Dawish's plan had been wrecked by Ajman attacking prematurely from east.

It goes with- out saying of course tnat ail of us are anxious to co-operate whole neartedly ¥/ith the Hoyal Air porce at^. all times, and I in particular shall continue to do so to the best of my power♦ 4® The reconnaissance misunderstanding could as far as I can see have been avoided, if His Excellency the High Commissioner or the Air Officer commanding had sejt a telegram proposing the reconnaissance the day before i.e. on 1st September. Even if the reconnaissance had only been decided upon the morning of the 2nd September a 'clear line' telegram to that effect, should, I submit, have been sent me, to enable me, to stop it if necessary. As it T/as His Excellency telegram informing you and me of the intended move only reached us after the reconnaissance had come and gone. This left me in entire ignorance from the very start of what Baghdad was thinking about or what the aeroplanes themselves intended doing. 5* A point which may be worth bringing out here is that news of the world reaches Kuwait very slowly. We have nothing in the nature of a Reuters Service, and news of the Palestine troubles had not reached us, still less any suggestion that the Royal Air Force Baghdad had been called upon to prepare to send reinforcements. Our little world in Kuwait consists almost entirely of Desert lews and desert happenings. In this, I think, we are up to date and have a better knowledge of^local situation than other people. be The Air Officer Commanding had made the sug gestion tnat it was his duty to find out for hinself exactly how the situation stood on 2nd September, as from my telegram of ^Oth August, quoted in part by himJiim, ne was entitled to view tiie situation with anxiety. He also iias suggested tliat the presence of 5,000 Akhwan under Faisal al Duwish ¥/ithin J to 4 days* inarch of Basrah, a vital port, entitled him to loiow what Duv/ish T/as actually doing. * My reply to tins point, if I may respectfully give it, is that Kuwait, a large town of 50,000 in habitants, was much closer to the Akhwan than Basrah, in fact only a day*s march away, and had there 'been the slightest cause for anxiety as to al-Duwish's intentions, I, as His Majesty^ G-overnment' s repre sentative, would have made it my duty to have let him know with the utmost possible speed. But I purposely refrained from doing thiSo 7. From all my previous telegrams, and reports on the subject of the possible crossing of the Kuwait frontier 'by the Akhwan, I do not think I suggested anywhere that the Akhwan had any hostile intentions towards 1 Iraq, or Kuwait. On the contrary, I think, I 'brought out that the who^e anxiety of the Akhwan leaders was to come to friendly terms with us, and 'be allowed to cross our frontiers as friends and new allieso Their assurances in this respect had 'been repeatedly made, and as often reported 'by me. That Air Reconnaissances had 'been frequently made early last spring as stated 'by the Air Officer Commanding without previous reference to the local Political Agent may have been the case, but 'alarums and excursions' were the order of the day and a state of war may be said to have existed with the Akhwan. At that time they had not revolted against Bin Saud f s authority. I however certainly understood from my predecessor, Lieutenant Colonel More, D.S*0., that healways j ^ ne/bisgcs insisted on 'being told 'before iaand or any mte: ed air action, and I presume reconnaissances were in cluded. Tiie contention of the Air Officer ConEnanding that in normal times he must reserve the right to carry out such reconnaissances in future (he 'being the Judge as to iThether a state or emergency exists or not,) without warning the political Agent, would he to establish a dangerous precedent and should not I thini£ be admitted© As you in your reply to His Excellency the High Commis sioner very px*operiy stated, so long as the situation can he controlled (as in the present case it was control led) by peaceful !means, it is the duty of the political Agent on the spot wording in close touch with the E.esi— dent and the Eoyal Air Force, to continue to control it. The matter at once assumes a different shape when the control leaves his hands* Then the Boyal Air Porce steps in, and rightly so. As already reported in my Confidential No. 517 dated 5th September, His Excellency the Sheikh also holds this the view, and in order to avoid recriiidnations in/future has requested that in normal times any intention of send ing aeroplanes to Kuwait, whether Civil or military, be intimated to him first _ I think his attitude is reason able. 10© The suggestion that a British Officer*s word should be Kept or otherwise in accordance with the good or bad name possessed by the opponent he is dealing with, should not I think be allowed to enter the realm of argument o 11. prom the concluding portion of both His Excel lency^ letter and that of Sir Eobert Brooke popham, it is abundantly clear that their omission to let one know in time of the intention to send a reconnaissance, wasin the form of an oversights Their very generous (/y sentiments of regret at the difficulty ana anxiety caus ed, cannot but be accepted in the same spirito The principle one stands for hov/ever remains, it is that the Political Agent on the spot must in normal times he informed of any contemplated Air Reconnaissance hefore- hand in order that both he and tne Buler should know what is happening and further that no air action^ and 'by this is meant homhing etc., should 'be taken in the area over which he has political control unless he himself stnd the Politic al President in the Persian Wlf asks for it.

September on subject of Special Service Officers, I am sending you copies of all demi-official and otlier correspondence I iiave in tiiis office on tiie subject in order to give you a view at a glance of liow tlie demand for an special service officer at Kuwait arose, as well as my Dredecessor' s and Sir Lionel Haworth^s ideas on tlie subject. I would also draw your attention to your office 110.14 of ^tJi April ±y&lt;dO to tixe secretary oi State tor Colonies as well as to your Ho.86-3 dated 2btli March 1^29 and your llo. 97-S of 2nd April 1929 paragraph 2, all three of which 'bear &lt;ri on the subject policy of 'Iraa towards Kuwait. 2. 1 do not think Colonel More would have ever agreed to have an special Service Officer in the first place had he not been a personal friend of colonel Dents. Both had worked together in the intelligence Department during the wai 5. It seems to me that ?7hile Colonel Dents suggestions for the posting of an special Service Officer were couched in reasonable language, Sir Lionel Haworth feared the 11 the thin end of the wedge'; and what he feared has rather come to pass. For though the request was granted as a temporary measure in the first place ana to meet an emergency, the Air officer Commanding would now appear to be assu/ming tnab • ^ 'he Hon'ble Lieutenant—Colonel C*C#J.Barrett, C.S.I.,C.I.E., political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, E u s h i r e. j'-—-that lie possesses the rigiit to send an Special Servi^e-^ Officer to Kuwait whenever iie chooses; (see paragraph IV of Sir Grilt &gt;ert Clayton's letter). 4 # i personally have only had to deal with one Special service Officer, Captain Barton, and a nicer fellow i could not wish to meet, but i always felt un comfortable when he was in Kuwait, and was Jiept wonder ing what he would report next. He, of course, visited every one from the Shaikh downward and i fear often had his head filled by information given by interested parties. It is true Captain Burton made a point of sending me copies of most of the telegrams he sent off, but the mischief was done, and I was faced with having to follow up many of them with denials, or say nothing. I had not the time to do the former, so unless a bad error occurred, I tooii up the attitude that as a Politi cal Agent of some seniority my telegrams would receive prior credence. Still there was the uncomfortable / feeling that his ¥/ord would be set against mine some- times. it was also worrying to know that Captain Burton according to his own statement occasionally sent off cypher messages, copies of which he never showed me. All he did was to mention that he had sent off a^ cypher about such and such a situation. 7. You will realize that it is difficult for me go drive my points home as well as I should like to, for theoretically it can be shown that a tactful Special Service Officer can and should always be of assistance to a rather hard worked Political Agent. I prefer therefore that you form your opinion in the matter from the demi-official letters and telegrams on the subject which passed between Colonel More,sea: Baghdad and Bushire b.jT* o. I can find notning on record iiere to sliow tha the Siiaikh welcomed the idea of an Special service Officer || (vide telegram No, 120 dated 4tn llarch iy2y from Resident quoted 'by sir Gilbert Claytonj. I only know that one of the Special Service officers (Captain Howes) was not i persona grata with His Excellency the Shaikh because of the way his (Howes) assistants swaggered about and made out in the coffee shops that the fate of Kuwait lay in the hollow of their hands. The shaikh told me this,after ff I had been here a month, and said that he had to complain | to More at the way one of Howes assistants had in spite I of warnings nearly brought about a riot by persistently blowing smoke into the faces of certain Wahabi visitor sitting in a shop. 9. As for Captain Burton, the- Shaikh certainly liked him but was inclined to fear him. He knew that hostile members of his own family the Subah, visited him, and was afraid they might try and create a hostile atmosphere towards him in the eyes of_ the Special service Officer and so in Baghdad's, 10. Lastly but by no means least the Shaikh has got the absurd idea into his head, that, from the days of G-lubb etc. Baghdad's official mind has been poisoned against him. He rather fears Baghdad, in consequence, and is inclined to look to India to see that no harm comes to him. prom his point of view it is unfortunate that the Royal Air Force are based in 'Iraq. as he feels they must share Baghdad's prejudice at times. The idea, I know is foolish and I've told him so. 11. I fear I must disagree with Air Officer Commandinfi ] comparison between the political Agent, Kuwait's position to that of an Administrative Inspector in ' Iraci - (para graph 4 of Sir G-ilbert Clayton's letter). I have served in both capacities and for considerable periods myself.Tiie political Agent serves His Majesty's (government of India, An Administrative Inspector serves the Arab G-overnment of 'Iraq, (with a siiadowy sort of allegiance to the High commissioner). The Administrative Inspector must therefore, 1 think, hold the political ppinions oi the Arab G-overnment he serves. So any criticism made on a^ special Service Officer's report would be biased by what ^he knew to be his G-overnment' s views. 12. It goes without saying that I am as anxious as any—one to co-operate with the Royal Air Force and give them all possible facilities at all times and in every way, out in this matter of aijl Special service Officer, I myself feel that in normal times I, as poli tical Agent, can and should be able to do all they want, certainly better than an officer strange to the place could. After all I have a good deal more experience than the average Special Service Officer. I have served in 'Iraq, as a political officer, I know the Euphrates and Southern Desert intimately, I have visited and lived with Bin Saud. I think I may be trusted therefore to know the politics of Eastern Arabia, and the various situations that are likely to arise. Of course should abnormal or war conditions-arise, then I take a back seat and shall have nothing to say against the appointment of an Special Service Officer, though I note from correspondence attached that even when that did happen before. Colonel Dent wrote a tact ful note to Colonel More about the appointment of such an officer. As I am anxious to assist, I venture to suggest the following way out of the difficulty. (a) Let me do all Special Service officer's work in Kwait for Air Officer Commanding. (b) In addition to repeating telegrams toHigh Commissioner let me send ail sue. to Aviation, Baglidad, also. This will save delay. (c).Let Air Officer Commanding grant me Es.1200/- to 'be spent on Secret Service work. (i have no Secret Service Funds of my own). I do not agree with my predeces sor's views ahout employing 'Agents'• (d) Let the Special Service Officer Basrah visit me occasionally for purpose of dis cussing matters. i could normally put hid- up for two or three days. !Se) Occasional visits from Air Officer Com manding^ Chief Intelligence Officer, as well as other officers on his staff, will always he welcome. Difficulties are •easier removed this way than by any amount ff letter writing. Also as the respon sible person here i shall feel that i am having a say in tiie matter.ehclosures . Telegram (P).

You are aware that my vie?/ of policy regarding KuY/ait differs somewaiit from timt of * Iraq.. I separate Kuwait as a permanent factor in our international policy from 'Iraq., wliicli has one interest as a mandate but quite another if that-mandate weakens or ceases. The posting of an 1 Iraq[ Intelligence Officer at Kuwait has a tendency, of which i doubt the wisdom, of bringing an 'Iraq, official as an immediate liaison bet- 11 ween Kuwait and 'Iraq, resulting, in opinions of which the Hesident may have no knowledge and thus Milch he may be unable to contradict if he disagrees with them. It would bring an 'Iraq, officer into immediate touch Y/ith the Shaikh of Tnxwa.lt and must weaken the position of tiie political Agent and produce friction since the tendency of the Shaikh will be to turn to 'Iraq, for assistance. This would gradually link Kuwait with ♦Iraq, and might result in a very close alliance, even a tendency to absorption in subordinate alliance as opposed to ibn Saud. As protecting power we should have to'combat any such tendency as opposed to our interests. I can see no compensatory advantage to be gained. Would you let rue know what the intelligence Officer can do that you cannot, and your studied opinion in view of what 1 have said. 1 am ctuite ready, if you can put up a case, to suggest an intelligence Officer from India. Yours sincerely, Sd/- L Haworth.From - Political, Kuwait Telegram (^) To Itesident, Busiiire No. - 14y. Dated - 2^rd February i9^P Demi-official, ^our D.O. letter Ho.77 is of loth February. I q.uite understand why you tnink it undesirable to have an intelligence Officer from 'Iraq, posted to Kuwait, and bu t for th e fact that it was only proposed as a temporary measura I would 'be as much o ppose d to it as you ar e. Ho doubt one reason why the proposal seemed to me so attract ive was that when it was m'ade l v/as snowed under with more worii than I could satisfactorily cope with, and I know that i he would relieve me of some of it. There is not the slightest nee d an Intellegence Officer here in normal times, and i think that qven now the only things which he could do which i do not are :- (a) would be he all -time work^ he could go roimd himself more, ana so get the Information quicker, (b) he could employ secret service agents^/l think, however, that at a time like the present he would be worth having for (b) alone. I have no funds for secret service work and i do not think that it would be desirable for me personally to employ spies in any case, yet it is an undeniable fact that tliey are useful and Kuwait would be the best recruiting ground for them for the type of tribal work which is required. I do not advocate your applying for a man from India as it would take too long, and besides he would be absolutely use- j less unless he knew Arabic really well. If you think that the advantages are outweighed by the dis advantages I venture to suggest the possibility of a com promise by your borrowing the services of an Arabic speaking § British offi cer from Air Headicjuarters, 'Iraq., to act Tempe r- i, arily as my assistant, on the understanding that I xvould only employ him on Intelligence work, for which they would/t would provide tlie funds, and he would make his reports to me and not correspond directly at all&gt; They might agree to this as the head of the Inteliegence in Baghdad and I worked together at inteliegence all through the War.

I shall be very pleased to examine and square up any agents that de G-aury may have out when he goes, indenting on you for such funds as I may require to do so. I am not, however, keen on undertaking the employ ment of secret service agents as ordinary routine, as I do not think it would be a sound thing for me to do in my dob. personall y 1 do not think there is any need for an S.S.O. here o nce things get norual again &amp; Kowcol goe s - as it presumably will, as soon as we know things are normal - nor do I tnink that one would normally get very much value out of agents, if one were to send them out. I say 'normally' on purpose, as occasions may arise when it would be desirable to send,out a man to get news on some specific point. If such a case arise, I could discuss it with you by wire, and, if you agree, ask you to make the funds 1 require available, and send a man out. I would only be prepared to use such men as the Shaikh knew of and recommended. Do you think this would meet the case? Regarding the present - i.e. before Kowcol goes - have you thought of the possibility of James spending part of his time down here? There is bound to be a certain amount to do - particularly when Kowcol is actually closingdown - for an officer wiio knows AraMc, which would more as S.S.O.»s work than mine.

I then gave orders to the HARB to march to and encaiup in DUWAIHIRAH and the AT a IBAH to go and encamp in ♦ ARJA and BWADIMI and the qAHTAH to join us in * AARI^» After letters had gone and people were preparing to march to those places, God ordained otherwise and His will is the best: Ad-BAWISH attacked Al-QA f IYAII and then became like Satqn, misguiding people especially those of the v ATAIBAII and MUTAIR round him, by sending to them FAISAL 'bin ETJMAID and Al-IOiADIIBI and some others who are with ( friends of 0 the Sharif ( FEISAL ? ) with the message that he ( MI SAL ad-DAWIBH ) had moved and done .what he had done only for the good of Heju and ITejdis and th^ emissaries of the Sharif ueclarcd that the Sharif and tine English hcid marched to HASA luia Q^TIJ and had taken 'both, while the other Sharif ( AiiDUIaLAH ? ) had taken ttt.

Some of the Al-HAJAR were misguided and raided some camels of Ad-iiAiliMAH and QAHTAH and their Satanic propanganda was spread everywhere so that the notorious Ihn JABRIH and Ion QATIM and Ibn f ASAI 'began to plunder and did not spare even their neighbours and guests. Then these misguided men assembled at ^ADHAKK and also Ibn RABIAII and the ATAIBAH arrived at 1 AR j A true to their promise to us.

The remaining IKKWAH with Ad- BUHAIiiAii attempted to water at MA&amp;AJAH wells but were pursued and nearly surrounded, so that he fled leaving his wounded followers mostly natives of GHATGHAT. As regards BAIsfl SALIM and DEUWAIiil, they began to move on the left and gathered other ill-disposed scoundrels and all of them proceeded to 8HA 1 ABA waters where they were joined by the IKHWA1T of the IIARB under 6 flags* They raided in parties of two flags each and loot- ~ed all whom they came upon, taking camels and sheep killing all the men* Then they encamped at MASEAK and were attacked oy IKHWAJS' ( Bin Saud^ ) whom God gave ■ victory over them.

Sir, if- X- 'Uj . n^fissrili records. In continuation of my telegrams 110.557, No. ^5? and No• 5^2. of otn and lOth. October respectively, I have tlie honour to send you fuller details of the above engagement between the forces of Bin Saud under Mo- hoined al Suhalli and the insurgents under Faisal al Duwish at InJair in Horth Hassa. Details of the fight have been obtained from the following sources (a) Letter from al Duwish to Shaikh Ahmado (b) The messenger of al-Duwish who though not allowed to enter Kuwait was interviewed by Shaikh Ahmad in person and is considered reliable. Cc) A reliable Aj^an of Kuwait sent by Shaikh Ahmad to watch events, Cd) A man of the Reshaida tribe Y/ho arrived at Jahra with some looted Awazim camels and gave an intelligent account of the action, No doubt fuller details will be fortcoming later, but I do not think they will affect the general story, though they may modify details.2* It would appear that on Friday 4tii October \ ( the Awazim Soutiaern force, witn wMcii were Bin Saud* s regular troops (Sarriya) and otlier allies sucii as Bam Haji'r and Bani Eiialid under tiie command of Mo- * nomed bin Sunalli, moved up from Ilaairiyen and affected a junction with, tiieir advanced troops at Injair (pro nounced Ingair) Jo Faisal al-Duwisii who Up to then had been averse to risking everything on a battle, and was out rather to manoeuvre tne Awazim into retiring, suddenly decided to attack, 4o Saturday at dawn was fixed for this and on Friday evening he moved the Adman under Hzam al- Hitlilain and Khalid al Mohomed- close in on the right flank of the Awazim (see sketch map attached). The liutair forces, including tne Ilwa, tne Braih under Ibn Ashwan, and detachments of Ibn Mashur and al- r.ufudi, he concentrated immediately to the north of the Awazim camp, 5o His orders were that 'as the sun rose the Ajnian should commence the attack from ulie iuast, and when well engaged, he with the whole ^utair would deliver the main attack. The ^tair mounted troops and the Ad^an ditto were to work round the enemy 1 s left flank and right rear respectively and charge home as they saw opportunity, be At about 4 a.m. the Ajman against order 5 precipitated matters by attempting to rush tne enemy's right wing, and ware at first entirely success ful, pushing in the darkness right into the heart of the Awazim camp and cutting up all who opposed them. Reinforcements of Awazim and Bani Ehalid however coming up counter attacked and drove the Ad man BackI(y€) oack with iossers- and pursued tnem right back to their/^ camp a 1000 ysrds away where hand to hand fighting continued. '/« At the first streak of dawn Hzam al Hathlain with the Ajnian mounted contingent relieved the situation-, by coming up and delivering mi a charge on the attack ing Awazim and Bani Khalid, and forced them to retire in disorder. In this charge Shaikh Hzam was killed, his place 'being taken ty Ehalid al Mohomed (ZebSfihman). 8. At this moment al-Buwish who had till then not moved, delivered his main onslaught with all his forces, on the Awazim left and centre,where were posted Bin Saudis Hathar troops, the Bam Hajir ana. main 'body of the Awazim (anl al Bayir as opposed to the ahl al G-hanam who were opposing Ajman}. Ai-Duwish ! s attack was immediatej.y successful, and those opposed to him are reported to have been almost wiped outo During this attack tne Mutair mounted troops fell upon the Awazim rear where tne tents and camels were inextn- cably mixed up and rounding up the latter drove them off the field. The fight ended by Duwish planting his standard m tne neart or the Awazim camp in front of ai-Suhalli 1 s tent, the survivors of the Awazim retreating Southward to the camp of the Awazim atL i al Ghanam situate about ii?00 yards South of their main camp. Here they reformed, and opened a long range fire on the Mutair and Ajman in occupation of their main camp. At this stage, the whole of the Mutair and Ajman became scattered all over the place in search of loot, and it was a case of every man for himself. Duwish therefore finding he had no concentrated body to continue the fight and pursue the Awazim who werei were obviously raXlying, decided to move back to liis . . vI / camp. Tins apparently botli his force and tne Ajman ^ did^ leaving no tiling in tne main Awazim camp standing, or wortii carrying 0ff o 10• Moliomed aJ—suiialli Bin Saud f s commander seeing tne day lost, is reported to nave ridden away with 4 men, and al-Duwish is said to have remarked that he should be.let alone so as to convey the news to his master. All al-Shuanbat (recently of Baghdad) how ever pursued with a small body of horsemen and is said to have caught him up and killed him with his own hand, llo The probable strengtn of the forces engaged are as follows;- Awazim ^000 to j^OO; Akhwan &gt;^00. Losses of the Mutair 20 killed (reported by al-Duwish himself} while those of the Awazim including allies and the Ajman were probably much heavier.. They could not ^ AlttOV) ^ave had lees tnan(3o) killed in each case. I ^12o It seems pretty clear that the Awazim lost % practically all their camels niombering at least ^000, but the Akhwan on the other hand expended much am munition which they cannot replace. So one may say that as far as gains and losses go the honours y^ttre even unless the Akhwan^reserve ammunition in the camp they looted. This is a possibility as the Awazim are re ported to have had a very full supply of British .&gt;0^ S o A o A • l^o At the moment of writing no further news has come in and one does not know how far the Awazim have been able to rally their forces, or whether ai-Duwish hast attacked them again or drawn off* Bedouin gossip has it that the Awazim have rallied and that the3Be will oe another fight. I am personally inclined to think tnis is true but prefer to await further news.10^ 14. The honours obviously went with the i^khwan, but the Awazim as fair as i can see^i have not received by any means a 'knock out' blow. 15* Further news is bound to come in soon and will be telegraphed you, I have the honour to 'be, Sir, Yo^r most obedient servant, Lieut -Colo, Political ^gent, Kuwaitoxiotes on i&gt;esert VV In general and witJa modification in iofb.alitiesidesert law ■ K'' is the same in Oman as eisew^re^ in Arabia/cased as it id on tlie tribal conception of society,that-^is to say corporate responsibility for the act of the individual member.

The magistrates of desert law,known in Kuwait as Ahl al Khibra( incidentally they may or may not be of the sheiich- ~ly house) have their equivalent here in the term 'haus' the law is hukum al hau^. Its scope in Oman embraces chiefly the nomadic remoter tribes e.g. I)aru,Yal tfahiba et( where not much settled government writ runs. III.

It is hard to prove that this or that article does not belong to the person in possession.

Finding good grazing in some deep gully, i they stay there, kneel down during the hottest part of the day, anu, having rested, graze again, 'fhen there is a spot v/ith good soi£t sand, the truant animal rolls about in it, grazes once mor.e, and when the sun sinks in the West cannot find its herd, which pasturing slowly, has in the meantime passed out of the sight. Sometimes a she-camel may like only certalfa plants, ^he is rested, fat, and can satisfy her desires. Home days she will not touch anything except her favourite dainty, hunting for it on all sides,- leaving the he^rd, and moving on. At noon, kneeling for a while to chew her cud, she catches sight of her plant at some diettnce, sets off 2 or it, and, then in the evening moans for the herd she can no longer find. The lost she-camels rtfn around all night and kneel down before sunrise, hut with the evaporating of the dew they get up and run in almost every direction. They seem entirely to ^ lack the sense of smell or the natural instinct which might enable them to find their herd. Being accustomed to follow the leading she-camel, they are at their wit's ends when they do not see her, and they wander aimlessly even if only one kilometer from the camp. On the other hand, the herdsman cannot look for a lost animal for long. On returning to his tents towards evening he rides through ' the camp in all directions calling in 'his singing voice, messje, for \ the stray beast to come back to its place. Often t he lost she-camel joins another herd, goes v/ith it to the camp, moans when she does not hear the familiar voice of the herdsman, and moves towards him as soon as his ditty catches here ear. ixK In case the stray animal is not in the camp, the owner and his friends mount their horses 'i and ride out the same evening to hunt for it. Tf it is not found, they -return the next day 'before noon, saddle their female riding canels, and the search begins anew- During their absence a member of the owner's kin rides up and down the camj) every evening: »shouting; Who has seen such and such a she-camel? if someone happens to have seen her, the usual answer is: M o thou v/ho hast lost a she-camel, know that she is at Bo and So»s.« !To one woulder keep such knowledge to himself. A etrey or lost ehe-.ceme is called the nan who has lost her HEDMB. Although sucking, young camels ctre constantly threatened danger from many heasts of prey, mainly wolves, the herdsman cannot always watch them, especially in a rocky territory or sandy desert, full of drifts and pits. However in order to preserve them he draws a circle around them with his staff or a sharp stone and says: 'The circle of Solomon, son of David, is between us and thee (wild heastsjj if thou breakest in it, Allah will break theer'Hotta slejman ehen Daud kenana w-benak w-en kata-taha kata-ak allah'.

A colt of the same mare captured hy a Rwejli must also he given hack to the owner» six camels 'being the reward in this case. Buch a colt is known as ri. The question then asked is: 'didst thou get thy (captured) tnare or her colt? gatak farask walla-l-ri.' On learning v/ho has recovered the colt of his captured mare, her owner ^oes to him, saying: 'The daughter of my mare is ?/ith thee, I demand her from thee, ana gari ha alejk.' 'That is not true, this is not the daughter of thy mare. I myself paid so-and-so many she-camels for her; n to which the owner replies: G-ood, now keep to the figure thou sayest thou hast paid, ok-od li hima sikt, till I bring my witnesses.' 'I will do so', agrees the other, and those present declare: 'We are thy witnesses that he will keep to such and such a figure and that he will neither sell nor take away the colt.' Then the owher goes to seek the' captor. The owner in search of his animal is called kassas; he is free even to go to the enemy, who in this case must help. On arriving at the latter T s tents, he inquires after his stolem mare and her colt» On finding what he seeks, he asks one of the enemy to come with him as a sdckx witnesswitness that the captured filly is actually the daughter of his stolen mare. Testimony of this kind being indisputable, hig tribesman says: 'Give me the proper compensation and take heri 'Hat li sowkaha w-hodha'. Me then gets five camels, the witness helping in the search, jakoss anha, gets one, and the animal is returned to the original owner. The owner of the captured mare tries first to ascerttain who has captured her and where she is kept. For the earliest reliable report of her whereabouts a reward of five ITegidiJjat 4.5Q) is paid.

Battle of Injair (Ingalr). Sir loth October also my telegrams 566 and 568 of 13th and 14th respectively, I have the honour to report the following further details ^ich may be found of interest. the 1st October last when a clash between the opposing forces appeared imminent, I arranged with His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad for four of his most reliable AJman and Shakespear and Hamilton to proceed to Faisal al-Duwish's camp and sit there till something happened. Their ins tructions were to report immediately the various stages of any battle that took place coming in one by one to do ^o. A1 Duwish knew the men were from Shaikh Ahmad and myself and treated them well. Our second^watcher' came in on 12th October and brought very interesting details, but as he left before it was known definitely what had happened to the Awazim who were trying to rally, I was unable to give you definite news regarding the final stages of the battle. On the night of the 13th came our 3rd watcher, also a letter from al-Duwish himself to His Excellency Shaikh Ahmd and from these two sources the 'fog^ may be said to have lifted, and the cause of events made clear. I might mention here that as far back as Mutair fidawis, elderly men who had served Shaikh MubarakMucli other corroborative news has also come in through Dhafir, Eashlda and Awazim sources to relations among the 'Hathar' of Kuwait. The full story is given below. 2. As was clear from my previous despatch, the Mutair broke the Awazim right and centre and carried all before them on the 5th October. The Ajman on the other hand suffered a sharp reverse on the Awazim right wing. The Mutair pursued wildly for a matter of 7 miles, tbeir horsemen numbering some 550 causing much execution among fugitives. On giving up their immediate pursuit of flee ing Awazim and loose camels, the Mutair returned to find Ajman still engaged with the Awazim and pressing them back. The latter had rallied in their subsidiary camp (see original plan sent) which was much closer to the main wells of Ingair than originally reported, and were put ting up a fine resistance. The Awazim had dug trenches everywhere and as daylight came on their fight became more severe. Both Mutair and Ajman from all sides then attacked and opened isj a tremendous fire into tbe camp of the Awazim vtiich contained women and children, camels sheep etc etc closely^ inextricably mixed up. It was this fire which caused so many casualties among the Awazim animals and women and children. Al-Duwish at noon called off the attack, mainly because his forces were out of hand and had scattered in their efforts to round up the Awazim camels. It might be mentioned that the Awazim women, when the Mutair attack was at its height, loosed nearly all their camels in the hope they would escape and be recovered later. These to the number of nearly 8000 were rounded up by tbe Akhwan. 5&gt; on Sunday 6th October all was quiet, though al-Duwish with his mounted men arranged that no one should come to or leave tbe Awazim camp. 6&gt; on Monday 7th October the Awazim sent in a man of the Zaab to treat for surrender. As a prelimi nary he asked al-Duwish if the Awazim could move camp to al -Batchsa, wells close to, and to the South East ofIngair, as the stench of dead men, camels and sheep was very great and the water was poluted. Al-Duwish agreed and likewise moved his own Ajman and Mutair camps to 'Dm al Hz am, a place commanding Batchsa# The moves of both forces were completed by Thursday 10th October# 7 # On the same day i^e# Thursday the 10th Octo ber Duwish sent in and demanded that the Awazim leaders come to his camp and discuss terms of surrender. 8 # This was agreed to and on Friday 11th Octo ber al-Fuqm with 3 men proceeded to the Awazim camp and escorted Mubarak al Milaabi and Abdullah ibn Faishan the leading Shaikh^ back to al-Duwish* 9 # Throughout Friday 10th the conference took place, and much speech making was indulged in on both sides, Tshich it is unnecessary to try to repeat# Suffice to say al-Duwish blamed the Awazim for bringing so much trouble on their own heads and asked God to witness that he had sent 3 clear warnings to them to retire, as tbeir continued presence, pinning him to North Hassa was very awkward* They the Awazun had chosen to refuse and had preferred to obey Bin Baud's commands, so he had had no alternative but to remove their threat by force. The Awazim on the other hand agreed that they deserved all they had got, and violently abused Bin Saud for leading them on by continual promises that large reinforcements were coming to their aid. None had ever put in an appearance nor were any at all in the vicinity except very weak details (no more than 112) of 'Hathar' troops under Turk! bin Abdul Aziz abu Ithaar who was at Shabach South East of Nta: trying to get Bani elements Khalid camped at Hajira (East of Sawar) and Bani Hajir camped at Nahaishiri (one day 1 © march South of Awaina) to Join him. These on the approach of al-Duwish had ) they said / positively refused to move North, the Bani Hajir going so far as to return to imir Saud at Hoffuff all the rifles and ammunition that had been sent them, with a\ message to the effect that they would do nothing unless either the King himself or he Amir Saud came and le* them personally# 10. On Jriday night 11th, the Awazim surrendered; al-Duwish allowing them to ratain their arms, property camels and sheep not actually taken in the battle. A1 Duwish further offered thejl Awazim two alternatiTes (a) That they should retire North well away from his rear, and enter Kuwait territory if they could make their peace with the Shaikh of Kuwait. (h) With their fighting men join the Akhwan in their future operations, leaving their women and flocks with those of the Akhwan &gt; The Awazim chose the former, and stari asked al-Duwish to write to the Shaikh of Kuwait and explain their case. The latter aid this on the spot, and the Awazim Shaikhs armed with this letter are probably now en route to the Kuwait frontier to beg asylum from Shaikh Ahmad. The Awazim asked for 20 days grace before they took their families North in order to bury dead, attend to wounded and collect fugitives. Al-Duwish who seems to have shown remarkable magnanimity all through, at once granted their request* u . At dawn on Saturday 12th al-Duwish, al-Fuqm and al-Rufidi moved South to try and round up Turki abu Ithaar. As a guard over their camp and to watch the Awazim, Bandar Duwish's son, Ibn Mashu^and Naif al- Hatlilain were left behind, 1S# Al -Duwish before starting gave out that he hal not much hope of catching Turki but he intended rounding up Bani Khalld, Bani Hajir and then proceeding against Bin Jaloui's camels in the Habii region North of Hoffuff. Afterwards he would deal with Hoffuff, Oatlf and Jubail, by which I think he meant 'areas' not 'towns', for it is obvious he would only tie him- self-5- / } V&gt;-&gt; ,j| 0 himself up if lie started besieging those places. 13^ The Awazim who surrendered were the Braichat, Haddalin and Musahma sections, as well as a good many survivors of Malaaba, Zaab and Sowabra sections who had bom« the brunt of the Mutair attack. In addition to Shaikh Hzam al-Hithlain, Shaikh Hama d bin Musemah of the A.laan was killed. Ho Mutair Shaikhs fell, and of the Awazim only bin Draih and Kilaan 'raieh' Fahaaia, were wounded# 1 5 # Afi tar as one can judge 42 Mutairi rank and file were killed. 35 Ajman « « « « 400 Awazim ? « ^ ^ The Ajmn had a great many wounded. The Awazim killed ^ ruw*. J 4- 4 are reported from many quarters to^exceed^900, but it s so difficult to get true facts that I have preferred to put their killed down to the figure stated. This how ever must be taken as guess work only. iB. Mohomed al-Suhalli was not killed after all. He escaped with 5 survivors out of a total of 70 of Bin Saud's men who were with him. He presumably joined Turki abu Ithaar. One Abdullah bin Subaii his second in oommand was the person slain by Ali al-Shuairebat. 1 have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.Confidential, British Keeidenuy and Contsulate^GemxrU., Bushire, 80th October 1929.

P«a5raPl&gt; ' paragraph. ^ n int (1). I have nothing to add to your remarks which are correct in every detail, except to say that the Shaikh of Kuwait denies in toto that he ever gave Ihn Mashur a present of any money, much less Dollars 6,000/-. The Shaikh also denies that Ibn Mashur purchased any arms or ammunition in Kuwait. He on the other hand admits having sent out the following supplies for the men of Ibn Mashur number- ing 250 who were camped at Jahara with him. 25 bags of rice. 20 maunds (80/ lbs) of dates* 1 bag of coffee•As the Steikii had denied them, entry into Kuwait, he con sidered it was up to him to send out some food, pending orders of His Majesty , s Grovermnent as to whether the party was to be allowed to remain in Kuwsi t or be ejected* at Hie Shaikh when Questioned about this, observed that/the time no 'rebellion' against the authority of Bin ^aud had broken out, and Ibn Mashur, who was out of favour only^ had in his possession a letter from Bin Saud offering him complete forgiveness, and inviting him to return to Riath. Such letter in the hands of Ibn Mashur and the letter's assurance that he was on his way to Bin Saud justified him, the Shaikh, in supposing there was no objection to giving him and his followers food for their journey back to Nejd* That Ibn Mashur in actual fact never did return to his allegiance does not according to the Shaikh, effect the issue* The treacherous seizure of Ibn Hathlain and the fear that he, Ibn Mashur, would be treated likewise, ob viously decided him to change his mind# All this was after he had left Kuwait* Conrplaint (2)» Ibn Mashur purchased 3 mares only whilst at Jahara. These were brought from Zubair not from Kuwait* The story that 10 mares were sold him by Subah bin Hasir of Kuwait is on the face of it an invention seeing that this personage was at the time undergoing a six months 1 sentence of im prisonment for the murder of his brother; and has only Just recently been released* Subah^s mother did it seems sell 2 horses belonging to her son to a man of the Ajman about this time - but there is no rea son why should^she not have done this# The Ajman had not rebelled then# Complaint Xgi# Shaikh Ahmad says the complainl probably refers to the visit of Khalid bin Mo homed (Sab Sahman) * This person arrived at Nigara 22 miles away, accompanied by 7men. He sent In and asked for peimission to visit Ms sister in the To*n, As tlie rebels 9 had baon in tlie mean time forbidden to have dealings with. Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad sent his oommander of troops to him with orders to eject him. This was done. nftTn pialnt (4) . I have no remarks to make, except that the Shaikh of Kuwait never sent Azaiyia any money# nmrrplatnt (5) . There is a slight confusion of facts here. In your letter under refe rence you dealt with the visit of Hzam al Hathlain and al-Faqm. Bin Saud curiously enough has not mentioned this visit. He does however refer to the f, secret ,, visit of Haif, al-]truqm f s brother to Hillal al Mutairi # s house (vide my despatch No.450 dated 29th July), Abdur Bahmaa al-Qpsaibt who was staying in Kuwait as His Excel- lency*s guest at the time, never saw Haif, but was told of the incident by the bhaikh himself. The ejection of the sick man Haif from the Town without his dinner, as soon as he was discovered, has been care fully glossed over# nrmr plkaint (6) . I have nothing to add to your remarks; exceft to say that in the portion where Bin Saud makes complaint about the crossing of the border by the Akhwan and their camping round about Subahiyeh, he has got his facts very badly confused. No Akhwan ever camped anywhere near Fintas, Abu Halifah, Shuaibah or Araifjan, whichthe ,, Q^sur ,, vil- lages -frbov® the sea coast. Nor are Bin Ba ud* s references to Naqasah and al-Syleiman understood, these places are forty milesmiles from where the Akhwan oanped. j 3^ in conclusion I might mention that Bin Saud's complaints have obviously been collected from hearsay evideno forwarded by biased persons ignorant of facts, and certainly not aoquinted with tli© Kuwait t8rrain» I do not think Bin Saud's chief agent here Abdullah al Nafisi can be guilty of working up such a poor case for his master, as he is much tosknowledgable to hare done such a thing. I would say that Bin Saud's two infor mants have been Abfiur Rahman al Qosaibi and al—Ribai# Wie former stopped in Kuwait for 4 days some time and stayed with His Excellency the Ruler, and it ill behoves him to libel his host in the way he has done, seeing that Shaikh Ahmad took partioularZ trouble to explain the efforts that were being made to prevent supplies going to the rebels / tod the strict measures that he the Shaikh had taken to prevent Kuwaitis from holding intercourse with their friends in the rebel oampj I myself went so far as to drive Abjfcir Rahman al Qosaibi in my oar Hound the varous Bedouin's ca-ps near the city to satisfy him that the occupants were not rebels in disguise, who had come in to purchase supplies This story had been told him by certain pro Bin Saudites in the Town# 4 As regards Al Ribai. This person is a spy pure and simple, and his visit to Kuwait was duly reported to you. He is of the servant class and a man of no account though greatly trusted by Bin Saud. Both the Shaikh and I knew perfectly well that his visit to Kuwait would result in a crop of accusations being made against Kuwait.

This authority was not an instruction to attack Faisal-ed-Dawish at sight, but was intended to enable British authorities to take drastic action against him if and when necessary without reference to higher authority. Colonel Dickson, on the occasion to which my telegram '0.100 (of September 19th) refers, did in fact take steps which resulted in Faisal-ed-Dawish leaving Koweiti territory forthwith. Had these stdps not been successful he would no doubt have had resort to more drastic action.

Reports of rebel victory over Ibn Sa^ud^ Northern Hasa concentrated on 5 lo result of which Awazim Shaikhs have surrendered unconditionally and are seeking entry Kuwait for safety should be treated with reserve. They constitute insurgent propaganda and reflect enthusiasm for rebel cause by Ibn Subah. Reliable reports from numerous sources confirm that A 1man who prematurely r^b^l attack fiu^^ere^ severe reverse heavy casualties and fled, Mutair with Ibn Mashhur (Huwalla) attempted to loot Awazim families and camels in rear but were counter-attacked by reinforcements Ibn Sa^d^ regular Beni Ha.ja and Beni Khalid and were forced to withdraw. Both nicies sustained considerable casualties. The Akhwan who were routed lost Hizam ibn Foran, Ibn Hithlain killed Ali Abu Shumairban and Ali ibn Ashwan severely wounded (former reported died at Kuwait). Duwish and many rebel concentrations now camped Wafra and Mishasha. area but some encampments reported moved Subaihiya. Ali Ashwan believed vicinity Araq. Since the action number of Ajman and Mutair families have been camped immediately outside Kuwait town and others now appearing at Tahra and intermineling with Ibn Subah»s Ruwaishda tribe there. Some Mutair have also arrived in% ^ in Kuwait territory as far as Liyah (50 miles from 'Iraq frontier)* Northern Hasa force to be moved up to Bad.1sa is likely to be reinforced from Hasa shortly. Supplies S. A» reported delivered by motor transport and further clash is imminent. Duwish and Ibn Hithlain have attempted trace negotiations with Awazim chiefs and h&amp; inforTriPd th^rn to neutrality and ^nt^r Kuwait for grazing', supplies and also security against any coming fighting* The indication was supported in writing by Shaikh of Kuwait which will undoubtedly be viewed by Ibn Sa f ud as a further act of hostility by the Shaikh. Negotiations were referred to Muhammad al Suhaili (Subai) Ibn Sa'ud's leader who with Awazirn chiefs is said to have agreed nothing could be consi dered unless Faisal al Buwish would present himself in person. Latter mistrusts and refused. Small force of Subai raided Dawi al Rashid (rebel Mutair) near M Shaqq looting about 300 camels on 13/10. Ibn lusa 1 ad has visited Hail.

' y ^ ir ' T -r-,-.™ , Jeddah, October 2%, 1929. I HAVE the honour to refer to my telegrams Nos. 139 and 148 of the 21st September and the 10th October last regarding the reported defeat of a punitive expedition sent against the Ataibah under the command of Khalid-bin-Lowai. 2. Further reports of this incident have now been received. 3. It appears, as far as I can judge from the confused accounts which have reached me, that a strong force of the Ataibah under El Dahaina moved southwards across the Mecca-Riyadh road, penetrating as far as the country around Turaba, raiding villages in that neighbourhood, but not venturing near Taif. 4. Khalid-bin-Lowai's expedition against them was not at first successful, and he was compelled to retire or else of his own accord withdrew to Khurma. However, on the arrival of reinforcements sent from Taif under Mohammed-bin- Sahmi, Khalid-bin-Lowai made a detour and threatened the Ataibah communica tions, thus compelling the forward detachments of the raiders to withdraw. He then appears to have followed up his success by driving those detachments northwards, and an action is reported to have taken place between them and the loyal sections of the Ataibah under Ibn Rubeian, in which they are said to have been defeated with heavy loss. It is now reported that numbers of men, women and children of the rebellious Ataibah have been, and are being, brought in to the camp of Khalid-bin-Lowai, and are being butchered in his presence, some of the more important captives being sent to the King, and, after a nominal trial by the Sharia Court, flogged and put to death. 5. Matters might have become more serious but for the fact that the raiding parties devoted, as usual, too much attention to plunder and too little to tactical considerations. Also, had some of the other Ataibah leaders, such as Sultan iVbu-el-Ala, who had apparently been wavering, thrown in their lot with El Dahaina, the danger would have been very much greater. Sultan Abu-el-Ula himself is reported to have been summoned by the King, and to have been sent to a distant region where he can do no harm. 6.

Similar letters having been sent to Q^tif and Eassa. n We convey to you the happy tidings that the Awazim crushed the vile enemy on the 1st Jamad I, (5th October 19S9), and that their chief ad-Duwish, his son Bandar and Ibn Ashwan , s two sons were killed and that the defeated were followed up to Hamadh and were slaughtered in a killing so great as will be handed down by the living to posterity * Five Bairaqs were captured from the enemy, and sent by us to Hassa* S# The messengers gave out that the day before the battle there were attacks on horses by 'fawart both sides and that on the 1st of Jamad {5th October 1929) Mutair heavily attacked the Awazim who coftsisted of four parties camped on 13ie Nuqairiyah wells (IngairK During the attack Ihe most southernly party was defeated and Mutair reached the Awazim^s camp and set up their Bairaqs in it. 3 # As to Ibn Shuqair, he too^C Dhidan from the Awazim, but the latter then counter attacked and defeated and iiiasta drove back the enemy to their camp. In the evening the Awazim again attacked the Mutair and fought with them with swords and daggers (hand to hand) and after-^ a two hours struggle the Mutair were again defeated and followed to Hamadh• 4. Ibn Shuqair escaped in another direction to that of the defeated tribes, whose total casualties are esti mated to be 800 out of whom ad-Duwish is one (undoubtedly), and also Naif Abul Kulab (Shaikh of the AJman) Ibn Ashwan f s sons and many others# 'Translation of a letter F| \ * From - Shamlan bin Ali bin Saif, Bahrain. To - H.E.Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah,C.S.I. Ruler of Kuwait. Dated the 10th Jamad I, 1348 {13th October 1929). After eompliments. Before this I sent you a letter in which I informed you about our safe arrival, nothing occurred here besides the fight of ad-Duwish with the Awazim. The news which has reached us is that ad-Duwish has been defeated but we are in doubt as to whether the news is true or not, but many stories have reached us from Hassa, Jubail and Qatif all to the effect that the fight took place on the morning of Saturday and continued for six hours, ending with the defeat of ad-Duwish who was followed to Hamadh, and that ad-Duwish himself and his son Bandar had been killed. There is an addition to the above news, received from Jubail, it is that Ibn Shu&lt;iair during the fight took some camels which belonged to Awazim and started to wards the West in another direction than that of the defeated tribes, we do not know whether he took these camels from Awazim during the fight or found them straying. This is a summary of the news which has reached us about the fight and the truth of course, will appear later. As to the Amir Saud, he has probably left Hassa today proceeding to the Awazim with a force, he ordered the Qusaibis to arrange to send his requirements to Jubail, this was done together with 500 tins of petrol for his motor cars. It is said that Amir Saud has fifty motor cars and that four aeroplanes will reach to him, God knows better if this be true.______ ^ No. 585. Polltioal Agenoy, Kuwait. CONFIDSI-WIAL.

We trust that you will redouble your energies to prevent the rebels from smuggling goods from or seeking shelter in Kuwait territories, absolutely and caapletely in every way.

In--? A/ Sir; 1 In reply to your tejBgram No«103E dated 2Snd October 1929, asking me to comment on the letter mentioned at the head of this despatch, I have the honour to remark that I /; / //if the King of the Hejaz and Nejd^ letter No• 147/9 dated 14tli September 1929 be carefully examined, it ndll be seen that apart from a certain amount of fresh padding delivered in rather more verbose style than usual, all the charges Bin Saud brings against Kuwait on pages 4 and 5 of his letter, with the single exception of charge No.9 are identically the same both in form and wording, as those sent direct to you recently. These were dealt with by you in your despatch No.61 of 30th September to fee addBBSs of H.M's Secretary of State for the Colonies, as well as by me in msfy No.575 of 17th October 1929 to your address. As for charge No.9. This is an incorrect statement of fact. The man' who brought the first news was one of H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait's 'watchers', vide ay teleferam No.478 of 16th August 1929, though perhaps this was not made quite as clear as it might have been by me. Further tie supposed sender of the message, Mohomed al Athain, the actual destroyer of the motor convoy in the Dahanna himself brought the news to Kuwait accompany ing as he did, Farhan ibn Mashur on his last visit to l+- ^ J t *rf u H/ -E- K. V Kuwaito This was clearly brought out in my despatch No.500 of ZWhAugust 1929 and paragraph 11. 2, As regards Bin Saud's charges Nos.10 to 18, ' -{ f ! ^ these also are identical with those mentioned in the King's letter to you: but as they concern King Palsal, I feel it is outside my province to comment on them» 2 1 As regards charges 1 to 6 ofl page 8 of Bin Baud's letter, these are the same as were mentioned in thp last nart of paragraph 6 of Bin Baud's letter to you, k only they have been rearranged, no doubt with a view to impress. Of these last charges Nos. 1 to 5 are fabrica tions altogether, and have been hopelessly mixed up with the Akhwan decent on Subaihiyeh under Faisal al Duwish on 30th August last. In this connection please also see jj Kmy despatch No^g jf of 17th October 1929 and last portion of paragraph 2, 'reply to cmplaint 6'. 4&gt; I am afraid there can be little doubt that all these 6o called 'charges' ot Bin Saud, against Kuwait and 'Iraq have been worked up from 'the collection' made by the arch-spy al-Ribai when that 'worthy' was in Kuwait recently. H.E. the Shaikh, of course, knew at the time what was in the wind and, if you recollect, tried to prevent his leaving Bahrain, but he was to^late , the steamer having already left* That bin Saud should continue to prefer charges of this nature against those who do n^t see eye to eye with him instead of putting his whole energies into the war against his rebellious subjects seems a pity. It looks as if, in his desire to find excuses for his lack of success, he is trying the worn out trick of the 'red herring'• X have the honour to be, 3±ri Your most obedient servant, ) VlSve^^^Li eat-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait•nnttrETDSHTIAU ' - ^ Political Agency, Kuwait.

His Excellency Sheikh Ahmad who as you know keeps himself informed of Nejd affairs through Bahrain by means of certain Kuwaiti merchants has received letters by last mail making the following reports (a) Abdur Rahman al-Qosaibi has written confidentially from Hoffuff to his family tbat a caramn between Nejd and Hoffuf has been taken by the Ajman also another belonging to Bani Hajir near Hoffuf. (b) A Kuwait merchant from the interior confims that Bin Saud has gone to Shaara 140 miles west of Riath. He adds that the Nejd -Fejaz road has been closed for some time. Also that the price of a bag of rice in Riath is now Rials 60/-. Further that the Hoffuf treasury is empty and officials have not received pay for 2 months. That tie people fear a sudden attack and that four or five patrols in 'ford' cars move out of tl the town daily and proceed towards the north returning every evening. (c) That a good deal of anti-Kuwait propaganda is of interestissuing from tlie Qpsaibi t s house, special items being that the Shaikh of Kuwaiti cars leave - regularly for the rebel camp wilii supplies of arms and ammunition, also that al-Duwish. has got one of the Shaikh of Kuwaitis 'Baira^s* 1 with him# (d) That Bin Baud has written to the Ataiha Shaikhs saying that the heads of Duwish, Ibn Mashur, Ibn Hathlain, Mohomed al-Khalid, and twenty three lesser rebels have been sent to Hoffuf, as well^ as several captured 'Baira^s 11 as a result s of the last crowning victory* Note * That Z war flags were taken from the Ajman by the Awazim when they were driven back at the battle of Ingair is admitted by the Akhwan# These were got though to Hoffuf before Buwish finally forced a surrender, and I believe have hung from the walls of the ever since as emblems of Ihe victory# I have the honour to be.

(b) His continued letter writing has of itself,£?? condemned Mai and proved to every tMnldlng person tiiat the situation in Nejd is serious^ (o) Till lie started defending himself like this the world only thought Faisal al-Duwish was ,10 fiy^ the peril® Now every one knows&gt; what was only guessed before, that western and central Nejd is in full ferment* That ilu^' (d) his frequent and regular statement^ 'fee principal rebej. leaders like Duwish, Duhaina etc have been routed and slain, is terribly bad policy, for now nobody believes what he says*' 4 0 Abdullah al-Hafisi (Bin Saud^ Agent) hitherto i staunchly loyal, is dismayed by such tactics and does not know what to believe. 'Statemmt' after 'statement* has been leceived from his kaster in the last two months, for public consumptiono But as fast as they are issued by him, they turn out to be falsehoods© As he confided // u to me pathetically recently al-Nafisi ^does not know what to say or believe*. 5» The insurgents in Hassa on the other hand effect to be in great glee. They hear of, or get copies of every one of Sfin Saud's 'statements', and their cry is^, did not we tell you you muslims, that our late master is no longer a true Mohomedan. He once feared to tell the smallest lie, but look at him now. He has left the straight path, and is now worse than any 'mushriq'. He started his policy of acting the 'traitor' to us his chosen Akhwan, and now finds he can do nothing without getting deeper and deeper into the mire of falsehood. His very lies prove that everything is going wrong for him in and well for us'. 6* (a) I personally hold the opinion that it is a IVttle bit early to form definite conclusions as to how things are going to end, but that matters are pro gressing badly for Bin Saud is very clear now. Every thing depends on how staunch the rebel Ataiba keep up-3- ' their pressure from Uie west# Tlie rebels in Hassa are jo full of enthusiast an^ use a slang phrase ' have their tails well up 1 *# They howerer have as their leader the redoubtable Faisal al-Duwish, than whom no abler or more dangerous adversary can be found in^ the whole of Arabia« Have the Ataiba found such a versatile and strong leader to lead them? That is the question* (b)» That Bin Baud feels that he can possibly sow dissention aaong the latter more easily than among al-Duwish^ following is proved( the^ attention be is devoting to the west® That Duwish feels it is now time to turn his attention to Nejd proper, and give the Duhaina♦s Ataiba encouragement is all significant# A1 fiicslxkfca: recent arrival at al-Duwish^s camp, was obviously to persuade him to initiate an attack on Riath itself from the North Sast ; and prove to those of the Ataiba still hesitating, that, he was not ohly very much alive but that he had been completely successful in the Hassa province® It should not be forgotten that Bin Saud for the past few weeks has been engaged in disseminating intensive propaganda among the Ateftn to tbe effect that the Hassa rebellion had failed miserably, and that al- Duwish, Ibn Mashur, Ibn Hathlain and many other lesser leaders had been executed. (c) • The Ataiba^ and Qassim^will by now have heard of al Duwishls de^feat of tbe Awazim^the force with which Bin Saud was to have driven the rebels into the sea* If now al Puwish appears in person before Riath, Bin Saud will find himself between two fires and in difficult pridicamento (d)© The attitude of the great Qassim Towns has so far been correct, but just in the same way as they threw off Bin Raschid's yoke and joined the successful Bin Saud, in the days when the latter rose to power, so Ihey may any moment eject Bin Saud^ governors and come to terms with the rebels# The people of Qassim-4- ^ of all people in Nejd depend on maintaining good rela tions with the great 'BS.dia n tribes, who are in a posi- 1 \ ^ topfii at all times to hurt them by destroying their gardens and cutting off supplieso They must Always a±sa: attach themselves to tbe strongest party in power© For the moment they are loyal to Bin Saud, but are grumbling at his delay in putting down the re be Hi on &lt;&gt; Should the Qiassim people decide Bin Saud t s star is definitely onthe wane, thesy will act, and if they do, I think we may assume it is all up with Bin Saud^ This is how I read the Nejd situationc (e). That Faisal al-Duwish is making a final effort to get Shammar in on his side, with the bribe of Hail, before he moves into Nejd, is I believe what is delaying him in his present locality South West of Wafrao The most persistent rumours are in the air to this effecto When he does move, which will be soon I think, he will march via Hafar al Atz, not Artawiyeh now* The more one sees of al-Duwish^ moves the more one must come to the conclusion that he is working out a well thought out campaign. In this connection I would remind you of my talk with Hillal al Mutairi the millionaire merchant of Kuwait and Fao. SSe my confidential No.546 dated E4th September 1929. 7. My latest information from the Akhwan headquarters in Hassa is an follows, and I bej-ieve this to be a fairly correct summary of the situation^for whatever tbe Akhwan may be^, they have systematically gone in fear say ing what they mean, and avoiding false propaganda. That I am able to get reliable mai through to al Duwish's camp from time to time and persuade that leader to re ceive and tell them part of his plans as well as other items of news, is I believe due to the fact that when I saw him at Wara, I was able to show him that I had no personal bias against him or any of his fellow insurgents&lt; In other words I was I think able to win his respect by-5- acting straight-forwardly at an awkward moment. Position of Rebel Poroes ^ (a) The Awazim are at Arak and are slowly moving up to Kuwait territory# (b) The Ajman are at Arak Hassa, their role being to look after Hassa and cut trade routes from the coast to the interior but not to attaappt to lay seige to Hoffuf or Qjatif. (o) The Mutair under al-Duwish are to move into Nejd and cooperate with the Ataiba in an attempt on Riath, incidentally causing Q^sim to declare for the rebels. (dKJahJah al Humaid with a strong ibrce of the Ataiba is at Arwah ready to move when al Duwish appears in Nejdo (d) Sharraim ibn Assai (Ataiba) is working in the direction of Taif. (f) Al-Duhaina*s force is engaged raiding the Riathps Hejaz road, their leader himself remaining for the present with Faisal al- Duwish (as sort of liason officer) • Position of Bin Saud's forces * (a) Nil Hassa, except small garrisons of 'Hathar' at Hoffuf^ Qatif ; and Ainain^ supported by a unreliable Bedouin# (b) A weak detachment of 150 men at Hafar a- Atz with a few Sahool and Subei tribesmen (num bers reliably reported to be quite insigni ficant) # (c) Ibn Msaad at Hail with a force of about 4000^maximum# It is not tpiite certain that he is definitely hack in Hail yet, but all reports say he is# (d) Ibn Rubaian and Ibn Haithal are at Shaarah with an unknown force guarding the approaches to the capital from the west ; and mainly en gaged in trying to keep up communication with.-6- n t/ the Hejaz. According to a direct report from al-Duwisli received on 20tli October, tliese two leaders have openly quarreled and their followers are fighting each other© Bin Sand himself has proceeded to Shaarah to try and heal the breach, with what success is not known# This Shaarah force is presumably a strong one* (e).The tpwns of Aared and Qjassim are in Bin Saud*s hands still, each having its garrison of Hathar levieso (f) Khalid bin Lo^ei appears to be, defending the approaches to Taif from the east though with what strength or success is unknown in Kuwaito Lieutenant-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.CONF I DENTIAL, 591.

Dated SOtli reed 31st Octoloer 1929. It is a pity tliat Buttolph has thought fit to enter the lists against Kuwait, an area for which I am resposihle. His reference to the Sheikh of Kuwait in his second paragraph is in had taste and I certainly object strongly to his statement that the Ajman and Mutair families after 'battle have come and camped immediately outside Kuwait town, and that others are mingl^ing with the Sheikh # s people outside Jahara. This is not only a deliberately false and mischievous statement 'but shows a lamentable ignorance of movements of Sheikhas rt Hatthar' Bedouin, who are all on the move after recent rains. For indeed is such a statement flattering to my intelligenc in view of the fact that I bow know personally occupants of almost every tent within a radius of twenty miles from Kuwait. As regards the Awa^im they are not due Kuwait territory until November 1st, vide my despatch No 569 of October 15th, actually they are now near Wafrah camped beside the Ajman and more or less prisoners. There are indications that Dawish after all may not allow them to enter Koweit as the rebels'view now is that in Kuwait they are capable of mischief and can correspond with Bin Saud, whereas with them they are helpless. There is no question whatever that the Awazim suffered a heavy defeat at Ingair and to save themselves were forced to come to terms. In this connection ^ consider my despatches more to be relied on than those emanating from Basrah or Safwan^V, z V;61/14 2062-31/10/29 f V Telegram Prom To Repeated Ho* 601 - Dated and received the 3ist October 1929.
