's Government do not recognise him as possessing / Telegram From To Repeated Dated bth- 2 - possessing any Vvalid title can form no basis lor discussion and that while His Majesty's Government are prepared to make some friendly concession this can only be within reasonable limits. 7* In any preliminary conversations with Ibn Saud you may not wish to proceed beyond this sta^e. But I fully realise difficulties with whicn you may be faceu and I do not desire to tie your hands unduly. Matter is mainly one of tactics as to which you are necessarily the best Judge and you are therefore authorised il you consider that no settle ment is likely to be attainable otherwise to proceed either ^ with King at Riyadh or subsequently 7 with Fund Kamza as and when you consider it necessary or desirable to V enter , further stages suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 below. 8. Second stage. Offer Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a relatively small area or stip immediately Sast of Blue Line as far as a line running from head of DOHgT-LS-SALWA to a point slightly south east of SAKAK (but leaving that place to Saudi Arabia) thence (leaving to *atar arid Abu Dhabi a strip of territory extending inland for no less than 26 miles to West of head of KHOR-LL-ODLID) to North western extremity of A**AL thence due southwards via (but to west of) BfvNIYAN to parallel 20 degrees North whence it would gradually rejoin Violet Line. 9. If this offer proves insufficient, His majesty's Government would be prepared to consider VaddinA to it as a tilrd stage a settlement on the lines suggested in Rendel's letter of November 7th to Mlr.Laithwaite (copy in my despatch No*436) involving creation of Desert Done under a special regime for a period of ten or twenty years subject to re consideration at the request of either i-arty at the end of that time. (See also Conclusion One of I iddie mast Sub committee meeting of November 8th). Ibn Saud woulu maintain in /-3- in this Zons axiy personal rights which he at present effectively exercises over nomadic tribes there e.g. right to levy zakat but would not posescss Vterritorial sovereignty and would therefore not be able to grant a concession. Desert Done mut* special regime would be defined by a separate agreement. Boundaxies of Desert Done would be approximately those suggested in Renders letter but would exclude BANIYAN# 10. If you are eventually convinced thx*t no satis factory general settlement can be reached on basis even oi this concession, His Majesty’s Government woulu be prepared in the last resort and in order to secure their desiderata in other directions to offer Ibn Gaud lastly xull sovereignty of a part at least of Desert Area referred to in immediately preceding paragraph subject however to i undertaking that no concession would be granted therefor by Ibn Baud except after consultation with His Majesty’s Government aid to concessionnaires approved both by His Majesty’s Government and by Sauui Government. precise limits to be suggested for -this additional area are still under consideration ai,~ further instructions on this point will reach you as soon as possible . Idea at present being explored is that part of proposed Desert Done lying to &lt;fest of meriai«.n 52 might possibly be thus conceded to Ibn Saud. South ena oi this line continue Vappear to join ’’ring fence” line oi Neutral Done at northern end of boundary between ^den Protectorate and Sultanate of Muscat and Oman assuming latter to run inland from HAS MALIGAR mut._ Ali at right angles to coast. 11. In any case however it will be important to obtain from Ibn Saud a categorical renunciation of any lights /-4- rights or claim to any kind of sovereignty outside 1 'rontier line suggested in paragraphs 8 or 10 or mut» 'ring feIlCe ,, of Desert ^one (see paragraph 6 of Kendal’s letter to Mr* Laithwaite). It would also be desirable for FJLs J^ajesty’s Government to retain flying rights not only ov^r Desert Zone but also over any area which might eventually be conceded to Ibn Baud under paragraph j-0. 12. You will no aoubt in any negotiations make such use as you can of fact tnat any of these concessions would involve acquisition by Ibn Baud of rights over very large areas to which he has at present no legal claim and would release him from obligations oi existing 'Blue Line' frontier from which he could not otherwise escape without great difficulty* 13. If you see any objection to any part of above programme I shall be glad to consider any observations you wish to offer. I trust however that present telegram will at any rate give you suificient idea generally of desiderata of His Majesty’s Government to enable you to conduct preliminary discussions with King Ibn Baud at Kiyadh if you proceed ?there or with Fuad Hamza. 14. Instructions on such points as landing grounds and flying rights, Saudi Government Debts, etc. will follow by despatch as soon as possible• -Secretary of State for foreign Affairs-Telegram From to Re ^eated Dated 18th xx H«M«'s Minister| Jedoa.

I»;any thanks xor t:.ose instructions which will certainly enable me to conduct the hirst round with luad although 1 must study paragraphs 8 to 11 more closely berore I can submit any report by telegraph on them. Meanwhile I submit the following points in anticipation of first conver sations with luad, who reached Mecca only yesterday and has not yet proposed a meeting. a. I am now disclined to go to Riadh in the near future even if Fuad brings an invitation which latest indications make me think doubt-ul* Apart irom reasons of practical inconvenience which have some weight but are not insurmountable, I see increasing political objections to an unofficial visit. I do not expect luad to *renew his impossible suggestion that 7all the negotiations should take place at Riadh but impression is widespread that such negotiations are impenaing especially in view of position as regai*ds Treaty of Jedda. This being so, my return, without having come to any definite agreement, might be misinterpreted locally las ? failure and Y due to pressure. Moreover King feels so nervous over the Blue L^ne question that it would be better to coniine myself to conversations with Fuad as long as possible•I propose, therefore| unless you see strong objections, to side-track any invitation, if I cun do so without risk of offence, but intimate that invitation next summer would be welcome, I shall, of course, see King here in the interval. b. »Vhat mai-s are you using and what maps should I use in discussion with Fuad ? Department of foreign Oihice has, I think, list of ma^s available here, further supply by bag of those to be used would be useful. c. I appreciate the effect of distinction drawn between personal and territorial sovereignty but 1 am not clear as to how distinction should be defined juridically if necessity arises. May I have information on this subject, not necessarily by telegraph, if explanation is lengthy. KYAF-® % Telegram From To Repeated xx Secretary of State tor Foreign Affairs, London Minister, Jedua. No#9. Government of India, New Delhi. Political Resident, Bushire . No.5. Dated 21st received 22nd January 1935. Your telegram No.6. Sub-paragraph (a). I do not altogether understand force of your first argument ag inst visit to Riadh since presumably some means, e.g. suitably worded official communi que, could be found to indicate that visit was intended that we should begin and not end negotiations. On the other hand local considerations must clearly be decisive. If therefore you consiuer it more advantageous to bring King into negotia tions at the end rather than at the start arid if you are satisfied that evasion or non-acceptance of his invitation will not give offence 1 do not wish to press you to go to Raidh now. 2. Sub-paragraph (b). Maps found most useful for reference here are (a) war Office map of Asia, published in r to 4 million. (b) Hunter*s two ma^ of Arabia. (c) rhilby*s map Rub-al-Khali• (d) Bertram Thomas's map of the same. (e) Iraq *etroleum Company's map of ^atur. Of these you already have (b) and (c). If you ao not possess or cannot obtain the rest please teiearaph ana 1 will endeavou: to send copy by bag leaving January 24th. Kap (e) and relevarI sheets of map of (a) (revised so as to show correct position of /-2 of SAKAK and certain other points) will also be sent by that bag. For general purposes of discussion with Fuad (a) is generally most suitable since it is more up to date than (b) but for the purpose of preliminary discussion (b) is adequate provided positions of SAKAK, IwiABAK and BaNIYAN are revised in accordance with (c) and (d)• 3.
