Proposed Intelligence Service for the Middle East (Draft Scheme prepared by War Office.) Reference attached Map. . I-—I- G-eneral Deedes considers that we are not getting the full advantage ■which our temporary occupation of the greater part of Turkey offers from the intelligence point of view. This calls for reconsideration of our whole intelligence system in the Near East, 1 which includes the following headings :— (i) Constantinople and the area at present covered by General Milne's command, including (a) Russian Mohammedans and the Islamic Centre at Kazan ; (b) the Balkans. , &gt; w (ii) Syria, Palestine, Egypt, the Sudan, Abyssinia and Tripolitania. (iii) Mesopotamia. (iv) Southern Arabia and Somaliland. (v) The Mediterranean, including Tunis, Morocco, Spain, Gibraltar, Malta and Italy. (vi) The Malay Straits and Dutch East Indies. (vii) Muscat, Zanzibar and East Africa. (viii) Switzerland. (ix) India. (x) Liaison between other theatres, including the Intelligence Service in India and Persia. , II.—1. Taking Constantinople first, the question can be examined under the following three headings :— (a) Clearing up of the existing situation from the point of view of general intrigue in the Islamic world. (b) Laying the foundation of a permanent intelligence service for the future. Both the above fall under the general heading ' Military-Political,' and may be considered as in the permanent province of the Military Attache. / (c) The purely military aspect. The Turkish Army has now been reduced to very small proportions, and normal military information can occupy but a small portion of the general intelligence work. There have been no complaints of paucity of staff on the military side, and General Milne has been given all the officers asked for ; the only point on which his wishes have not been fully met is that of grading. 2. From what can be seen in London of* our intelligence system in General Milne's command, the following criticisms may be made :— (i) Insufficient liaison with other theatres. Note. —This matter has already received attention, and instructions have been issued for the exchange of visits by Intelligence Staff officers between various theatres. (ii) The organisation appears to be ill-balanced ; the Brigadier-General being located at Tiflis, while Intelligence at Constantinople is co-ordinated by a General Staff Officer 1. This is obviously an unsound arrangement, as Constantinople must be the hub of any intelligence system in General Milne's command, and adjustment is called ior at the present moment in view of our contemplated withdrawal from the Caucasus. (iii) Not sufficient is known here regarding— (a) The actual distribution of duties among the large intelligence staff at GeneraV Milne's disposal. (h) How much and what nature of detailed information is being obtained, (c) Whether this information is being recorded and made available for the political side, which it most largely affects. {d) The range oi secret service organisation, and how the considerable sums allotted for this purpose are expended. 1 This expression is adhered to for the purposes of this paper. But the expression ' Mohammedan world ' would illustrate more properly the area to be covered. S 52 50 9/19 A2 (e) What organisation exists for the collection of economic intelligence. if) What nse if any, is being made of Consular Olhcers. hntish tta( ei.^, c. (3) What steps are being taken to keep an eye on Russian Mohammedanism. 3 It must be realised that as regards Constantinople Military-Political intelli- cence will be a permanent service, whereas the purely Military Intelligence service can onlv be temporary and transitory. 1 he current situation is in itself much more Political than military, but wo are able as a military measure to maintain temporarily a much larger staff than could ever be possible as a permanent organisation. Therefore, Military Intelligence, in addition to dealing with the current situation, should devote itself to the collection, filing and card-indexing of information for permanent records in the Office of the Military Attaches, the \&gt; ar Office and the Foreign Office, in addition to such other offices as may be concerned. Ihese would include, according to occasion, the Admiralty, India Office, hoard of Trade, British Museum, Colonial Office and possibly the Home Office. The question of circulation is considered hereafter. 4. Probably the best results will be obtained by forming a branch of Arbur 1 in Constantinople, which would form a common pool from which all branches of intelli gence could draw information as required. Personnel for this might for the present be drawn largely from the military staff, which could probably spare a sufficient number of officers if it was carefully reorganised, though it is not possible to say from here in detail how this can be done, vide 2 (iii) above. This branch of Arbur should for the time being work under the direction of the Brigadier-General, Intelligence, in Constantinople, and busy itself in (a) tiling information for permanent records, and (6) producing considered appre ciations regarding the more permanent factors which would assist the shaping of our policy in the Middle East. Though it would be impossible to maintain this branch when once our Army of Occupation had been withdrawn, it should be possible when the time comes to hand over to the Military Attache's office a co-ordination of the main threads of intelligence under appropriate headings, and the nucleus of a permanent Secret Service.'' 5.. To conclude as regards General Milne's command :—• Though it might be considered preferable to await a detailed report from him, the time at our disposal may be so short that the following steps are advocated for action without further delay :— (а) Transfer of the Brigadier-General from Tiflis to Constantinople with orders to— (б) Reorganise the existing intelligence personnel with a view to allowing for the formation of a branch of Arbur in Constantinople, after providing for the maintenance of the ordinary routine service of information. ihe area to be worked would be the same as that at present covered by General Milne s intelligence system, but would include the Balkans, as mentioned hereafter, and special attention should be called to Kazan. Before we withdraw from the Caucasus, General Milne should be called upon to do all that is possible to establish, ya Constantinople and Tiflis, a service of agents with the object of keeping our Government informed regarding any tendency towards an amalgamation of the Ppr^fr r rtars , w ( 1 n M Unuis OT Shialls of Turke y.

A\ e are now brought to a consideration of the intelligence systems m Egypt, which must, of course, be in close relation to those in Constanti nople and Mesopotamia It will, of course, be realised that under normal circum- stances a military_ intelligence staff will always exist in Egypt independently of wnatever political intelligence service is set up permanently. The military branch need not, however, be a large one; its principal duties presumably being to draw up military appreciations based on information which could be provided from the permanent service discussed below. t . \ ™ S f ^jce in Egypt could not take a better shape than a large bianch, of Aibur, which should deal with the following areas :— Syria- Sudan. Aiabia (less areas dealt with by Abyssinia. Mesopotamia and Aden). Tripolitania. Egypt. Such a branch should be able to feed the High Commissioner, the Army of Occupation and London with all necessary information of other than a purely militarv character. As long as the administration in Egypt and Palestine remains of a military character it should remain under the control of the Chief of Military Intelligence. 3.—-(i) It maybe as well to consider here a suggestion in this respect from General Allen by (attached as Appendix II a . The paper in question is on the right lines, particularly as regards the proposed mixed composition of the personnel. But the suggestion may be dismissed at once as too ambitious regarding the area it is proposed to embrace, and as denoting an aspiration to over-centralise. As long as we are to remain an Eastern Empire there is only one place where we can afford to centialise, and that is London. If this principle is not adhered to there will always be the tendency, only too conspicuous at the present moment, for our Government to get out of touch with their responsibilities in the East. Also London is tile most complete centre of communication, and Near Eastern affairs are not so disconnected from the affairs of America, Europe and the rest of the world as the paper in question suggests. And it would be a great mistake to suppose that, because Egypt is a great British centre in the Mohammedan world, it is neces sarily the most important centre of Mohammedan intrigue. On the contrary, if they have not done so already, agitators are quite astute enough to seek in the near future for an exchange agency more remote from British interference than Cairo. (ii) Here it may be pertinent to observe that since the reorganisation and elaboration of the E.E.F. Intelligence last year, less has been known in the War Office than previously of the situation in the area covered by its activities. Though the recent outbreak in Egypt may, or may not, have been anticipated by the local Intelligence Staff, no warning of its proportions was conveyed to London such as to enable arrangements to be made for the inevitable dislocation of British troops. 4. It is therefore suggested that General Allenby should be called upon for detailed proposals regarding :— (а) Expansion of Arbur at the expense of purely military branch of intelligence for dealing with information in the area defined in III. 2 above. (б) Proposals for liaison with other theatres. IV. —1. As regards Mesopotamia. —The intelligence system there must, of course, be in touch with all other Mohammedan theatres. As in other theatres, the intelligence will mainly be of a military-political nature for some time to come, and the situation can probably be dealt with best by expanding the existing ' Arbur ' organisation at the expense of the purely military side. This organisation would necessitate some amalgamation of the political and military staffs, but, as in Egypt, it should continue under the direction of the Chief of Military Intelligence as long as the administration of Mesopotamia remains of a military nature. 2. With a view to reorganising existing personnel on the above principle^ General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, might be asked, in co-operation with his Chief Political Officer, to draw up detailed proposals, which should include s 52 1 This includes the area covered by the activities of the present E.E.F. a 24 to, Brim i. -.1..••'«'•»' »««- and T Aden, - I r n t ia : , Egypt, Feheian, Constantinople.

Somaliland, apart from its interest to the Colon al Office, is mtimatelv connected with Aden, and it would be desirable that a small branch of Arbur should be established at the latter place so that material could be systematically and independently compiled in order to guide the formation of our policy in these regions. VI Having now considered the Intelligence -Services situated at the Head quarters of Armies in the Near East and at Aden, it remains to arrange for less conspicuous, but none the less important centres of information for the Mohammedan world. These may be taken conveniently in the following order : — 1 The Meditevvancm, including lunis, Morocco, Oibraltar, Malta, Italy, and No elaborate organisation is necessary for this area, and the local intelligence staffs at Gibraltar 1 and Malta 1 in liaison with the Military Attaches at Madrid, Lisbon, and Rome should be able to do all that is required. But it is essential that this liaison should exist, and that each of the above should be au fait regarding the whole organisation, and should make full use of Oonsuls and tradeis, 6.^7., the Maltese Colony in Tunis and the British Consul at Tangier. Reports should also be exchanged as freely as necessary with Hondon and the other centres of Mohammedan information. Instructions should also be issued authorising correspondence of this nature. 2. The Malaij Straits—These connect through the Dutch East Indies with the Hadramaut, Aden, and Mokalla district, where a large Mohammedan landowning element has emigrated. Arrangements were made fairly recently for the installation of an Intelligence Officer in Java, and an increase to the inteiligence staff at Singapore 1 is now receiving attention. So here, also, all that is required is that the whole organisation should be understood at these centres, and correspondence and liaison as freely exchanged as necessary without over-development. Liaison would normally take the shape of exchange of visits by officers proceeding on leave or on taking up appointments, &amp;c., and for correspondence all that is required is the issue of instructions permitting freedom of address. 3. Muscat and Zanzibar. —There is a close affinity between these two places, and though not of the highest importance, the Mohammedan current flowing between them via Socotra needs watching. Zanzibar also affords a suitable centre from which to keep independent observation on Mohammedan opinion in British East Africa. There is no reason why the service at Muscat should not remain under India as at present; no increase of personnel or even change of organisation should be necessary. It would merely be a matter of informing our representative at these places regarding the general organisation for intelligence in Mohammedan countries, and to arrange for direct inter-correspondence on behalf of the respective residents as necessarv, without, in the case of Muscat, intervention of the Indian Government, who would, however, naturally receive copies of everything that passed. . ^ ^ India — Ihe intelligence system in India calls for little comment. It is efficient and the India Office is well supplied with information. The area which it is suggested India should be responsible for is shown on the attached map, and all that 1 The diagram shows branches of Arbur at Malta, Gibraltar, and Singapore. Whether or not it would actually be necessary to form these is a subject for further consideration.BSrSySL*** 1 * W the whole organieation and 2. Pereia.—The same remarks apply to IVria where inteliigence might continue to be co-ordinated at the Ministry and circulated from there as necessary. VIL Europe.—1 In addition to the actual Mohammedan countries, it is essential to keep an eye on Mohammedan intrigues in Europe, and to ensure this it will be necessary that all our Embassies and Military Attaches in Europe should be cognisant of the system pioposed above, so that they would know with whom to correspond direct m case of no point of interest to no particular intelligence centre arising lieyond tins, it may also be necessary to maintain an Intelligence Bureau in some central place in Europe, as is at present the case in Switzerland. It remains to be seen whether Switzerland will remain the most suitable centre when once peace has been declared and Europe settles into its new shape, but this service should at any rate be maintained for the present. It will only be necessary to acquaint our bureau in Switzerland with the full scheme and give them instructions to correspond freely with the various centres when necessary. VIIL London. —I. Haying now considered the various'collecting centres of Mohammedan information, it is necessary to examine our own organisation in London and see whether any reorganisation is required. The various offices which may be affected have been considered in para. 1 (3) above. At any rate, until a Ministry for the Near East or some such organisation is established, it does not seem likely that the information received can be co-ordinated exclusively in any one of the existing offices, and probably the present system of decentralisation, supplemented by a central branch of Arbur to circulate information received from Arbur branches to departments concerned, is the best in existing circumstances. 2. At the same time, the Eastern Committee should be retained under a selected 1 resident so as to bind the whole together as at present. The Committee need only assemble when necessary, but should be endowed with executive power to deal with matters of general principle concerning the 'Near Eastern Intelligence Bureau.' 3. This question involved consideration of the means of circulating information to those principally interested. Probably the most satisfactory organisation will be the establishment in London of a central branch of Arbur under a Director and representatives of all departments. This central Arbur would receive from its branches abroad detailed information supplementary to that telegraphed direct to the head offices by the various local authorities, and would be responsible for analysing this information and distributing it to all concerned. The Director might be appointed by the President of the Eastern Committee, to whom he might conveniently act as Secretary for purposes connected with proceedings of the Eastern Committee. 4. Generally speaking, the proposed organisation 1 would supplement, but not interfere with, the existing system, as conducted in liaison between the various offices in London ; but two practical additions present themselves :— (а) Liaison officers appointed by the Eastern Committee should periodically travel from one end of the organisation to the other. They should have no executive power, but would merely advise and report. (б) Officers and others should be encouraged, under reference to the Eastern Committee, to spend their shooting, &amp;c. leave in obtaining knowledge of the countries. To recapitulate. IX.—1. The proposed scheme practically amounts to the - establishment of 44 Arbur ' branches throughout the Mohammedan theatres with a central branch in London. These branches would embrace all sections of intelligence w^ork and would be complete in themselves. Their personnel would represent all services, and, except where Military Administration prevailed, would normally be under the control of a Political rather than of a Military officer. But a clear understanding should be 1 If, as has been hinted previousiy, a Near Eastern Ministry is formed, the -whole question will need reconsideration. But for the present the Eastern Committee practically takes the place of a Near- Eastern Ministry.6 established that whenever it became necessary to revert to Military Administration, the- whole intelligence organisation should again be placed at the disposal of and under control of the local Military Commander. 2. For its success it would depend upon the simple principles :— (а) That all concerned should be acquainted with the reasons for and nature of the full organisation. (б) That a certain amount of overlapping would be unavoidable, but need not be feared. (c) Freedom of correspondence. 3. To give effect to it, if approved, it would merely be necessary to circulate to all Embassies and proposed centres :— (i) A diagram and map with an explanatory note on the above lines. (ii) Instructions regarding inter-correspondence and liaison. 4. The most important step is to transfer Brigadier-General (Intelligence) from Tiflis and Constantinople with instructions as to II. 5 (6) on page 2. This should be done at once without prejudice to consideration of the details of the full scheme. X. In conclusion it may be remarked that in drawing up the scheme an effort has been made to upset existing organisations as little as possible and to avoid an elaborate scheme which might defeat its object by its own weight. In fact, to observe this principle, that the means must not obscure the end.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000323_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B329</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000323</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B329</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Proposed Intelligence Service for the Middle East'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-10T11:19:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this sequence commences at folio 66, and terminates at folio 70, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
