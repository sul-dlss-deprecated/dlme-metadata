CONFIDENTIAL 1 U , : n/ y Will you please refer to your despatch No. 27(35/8/77/50) of the 8th November. There are in fact no levies in Qatar, only a Police Force. The niuscat Government may perhaps have been thinking of the Trucial Oman Levies which are now in the course of being established, and as the presence of this force on the boundaries of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman is presumably a subject of interest for the Muscat Government, Sir Rupert has asked me to give you a brief outline of the scheme and its purposes so that you can keep the Muscat Govern ment informed. 2. The main duties of the force which is shortly to be established at Sharjah are:- (i) to provide protection for the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and other British Government officers when touring, (ii) to assist in the suppression of the traffic in slaves, and (iii) to assist generally in the maintenance of law and order on the Trucial Coast under the direction of the Political Officer. 3• The strength of the force to begin with is to be limited to 70. A nucleus of officers and men from the Arab Legion is expected before the end of the year and it is hoped to recruit the rest locally. 4. As the Muscat Government will no doubt hear of the exist ence of this force from other sources, I should be grateful if you would inform them about it on the above lines. I enclose copies of the scales of pay for the new levies and also conditions of detach ment for the Arab Legion personnel. The exact scale of pay for local recruits will be decided in the light of conditions on the Trucial Coast, but should approximate to the total pay laid down in column 3 of the enclosure, less the 30% deputation allowance which has been added to attract recruits from the Arab Legion. There is no objection to your communicating to the Muscat Government so much of the enclosure as you consider desirable. 5* There is also of course no objection to your passing on to them such information of the conditions of service of the Qatar Police as you may receive from pelly.

It appears that towards evening some thirty ren, nith^out weapons, attacked the uardroor arid released three of their comrades undergoing short sentences of detention* The ubed.'ir lajor, ex- akistar anry and recently promoted to the rank of Lieutenant by the Sultan, attempted to intervene and was rouphly handled* lie was found later by Lt*Colc«iel V/oods—Ballard, T inis ter for ioiei^n Affairs, in the guard- room with &gt;aiyid Fahr, the 'Sultan’s youngest brother^ who is serving in the Infantry, standing guard with a rifle to protect him* ’ egor Campbell, the Corr'andant ifas on leave* The thirty ren concerned and the three prisoners had taisen their charpoys, and settled thenseives for the night QrtP on the hockey field, a d refined both to ret m to barr das or to surrender the priscwiers, though they showed no 1 ‘urther intention of violence. They oorploined of the ubedar ajor’s 'eeral attitude to them* Colonel oods—Ballard, who was officiating for ^'o^or Campbell, and the battalion Hav^lrtar ’ a)or endeavoured to persuade the men to return the prisoners, st ting th t until then^ their greviances, if any, could not be heard* Up toridnight nothing hrd been acieved, and the linister for l-’oreign Affairs come to consult me, before reporting to . aiyid khihab, the Sultan’s representative, who had retired for the night as usual to his house at Sidab. 3* Colonel /oods-Ballard thought that the disaffetion of the troops probably extended beyond the actual men involved in the present incident to about 50 f of the '.Thole force, then at the strength of 276 all ranks (full strength 305)* The force consisted of latlians, ?*uscatis and 'iakrani Paluchis and other Baluchis. The Baluchis cor p rised . bout half the force, and these were the men disaffected* The ’ubedar ajor is a Pathan. Ven so Colonel ffoodn—T?a31' rd f elt thrt he could not rely upon any of the troops to enable him to take forcible measures to settle the matter, and he enquired whether there wns any possibility of qy sunmoning a frigate, simply to pay a visit to uaeat, as he t ought its pnaence alone mi. ht influence the situation. k* Upon this I expressed tVie view that a frigate would obviously not arrive for at least tr.To d ys, and I u»as extremely doubtful if its presence in the manner suggested rrauld hrve any effect whatever, whilst for it then to leave with the matter unsettled vrould be unsatisfactory fro© several angles* I lor did I think that Us Majesty’s Government v/ould wish the Poyal avy to bv^come in any way involved in this matter unt -i 1 or unless there vr a ary serious threat to British lives and property and the uscat Government declared themselves powerless to meet it. I suggested t)mt this was unlikely to happen unless it w s provoked by turning off food supplies, resulting in the miscreants resorting to looting.

In all these cireunstanoes and as the Minister for Foreign .Affairs was of the opinion that the l uscat CcRrenment would in the end have to got rid of the unreliable elements of their force,including the three prisoners, I suggested that the wisest course would be to call spokesmen from the men, hear what they had to say, ard, in the absence of any reason to alter their decision* the Iliac at Govc nxoent ^ould inform then that as they were obviouslv dissatisfied with the conditions of their service and the ! uscat Government were equally dissatisfied with them, thqy would agree to part and t' ey would be discharged forthwith and, provided they believed quietly, thiey would be paid up to the date of discharge and repatriated at government expense to their hemes. 6* .Tier oonsultatior. with the Pul tan* s * •epresentative, this course was adopted, and next morning aiyid Phihab ard the ? iris ter for &gt;Oreign Affairs went out to Bait al Fala^ and interviews the troops accordingly. As a result, besides the thirty three nen taking pa. G in the incident itself, 90 men were discharged and sent by stea^e to ::4krnn via Gwadur cm the 30th iepteriber. % ' The total force now remain ng to the Jult n is 1 76 of which 7. 113 are usc itis and I^athans, and 63 'other” Baluchis.

'a^or Canpbell, the Cccmandant has been recojlled fren 1 8 . I had occasion,recently, to report th &gt;t there had been a nurrber of desertions by men on leave, and forthir reason the force was already under strength. Apart from the unsatisfactory quality of the * OPranis, it is understood that the pey is very low and 'the Sultan has not yet approved of lajor Oampbell^ recorzaendations for increases. 7; tirther, owing to sickness and absence on leave of both the ! inister for Foreign Affairs and * ajor Oampbell, the force has, in rry opinion, been inadequately officered ever since April. This oust have contributed preatly to th£0 rapid dc terioration since last year when their morel, training and discipline seemed good. It certainly accounts for the unexpectedness of the incident on the 28th eptember. But, in any case, it is to be hoped that the sultan will noa r both raise the pay and cease to engage these types of Baluchis, who have ever proved unreliable, arc ?hon Indian Anry ceased to reendt for this reason years apo* I have the honour to be H.B.IA’s m Your obedient servant. olitical /gent, Uscat.I have received .**n enquiry fron the ^residency as to whether family alXowanoes are paid to other ranks in the 'uscat Infantry and if so tihat documents and proofs are required from the men concerned to support their cl'im* 2* It is not stated, but I think this information is % required in connection with deciding what terns to provide for certain levies it is proposed to raise elsewhere. 3 .

Sir, I am directed to forward herewith a copy of a despatch which the Political Resident has addressed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the mutiny of the Muscat Infantry reported in your despatch No. oo ( or?/a /nn / 50 ) of the 9th October, and to kindly to take action on the lines indicated in para 3 of the enclosure. I have the honour to be, Sir, H.B.M's Political Agent, Muscat./»*'? A l *'■&gt; I k I have the honour to forward herewith a report I have received from the Political Agent, iluscat about a mutiny which took place in the Muscat Infantry on the evening of the 27th September. Fortunately, no casualties occurred, but the mutiny resulted in 90 men bein^ discharged, which is a serious deple tion in the strength of such a small force. The turn-out of the i uscat Infantry is good, but the material of which it is composed is not of a high standard and their fighting ability has never been put to the test. I have always been doubtful regarding the amount ofopposition they would offer to a serious tribal attack on i-uscat, and with their present reduced strength, their opposition is likely to be still less effective. It is fortunate that at present the relations between the Sultan and the tribes of the interior are reasonably good and there is little likelihood of hostilities breaking out, but snould an emergency of the kind contemplated arise, the Sultan would probably call on us for assistance. 2. Apart from this, I think the Muscat Infantry are well rid of the Baluchis concerned. They were recruited from Mekran with the knowledge and approval of the Government of India before the transfer of power. They are nov* T subjects of a State which has acceded to Pakistan and presumably must be regarded as Pakistani nationals. I have been somewhat surprised that the Pakistan Government have not protested at their continued employment, a number of them have deserted since the transfer of power and it has not been possible to take any action to secure their arrest and return. The remarks, however, which jfejor Chauney makes about the cessation of recruitment of Baluchis in the Indian Army are perhaps a little misleading:. The Baluchis of Mekran, so far as I am aware, were never recruited for the Indian Army. Large numbers of them served in the ekran Levy Corps near their homes and gave reasonable satisfaction though their fighting ability was never s-riously tested. They were as good material as could be obtained for the Muscat Infantry when Baluchistan was still under our control. In the present circumstances, their further employment is clearly undesirable. 3 f &gt; I do not know how they can be replaced and I am asking Major Chauncy to report the sources from which the Muscat Government propose to obtain new recruits. The present Comman dant, dajor Campbell, has an excellent knowledge of Arabic and possibly the opportunity will be taken of making the force an Arab one and changing the language in which it is drilled from Urdu to Arabic. I am also asking Major Chauncy to report any improvements which are made in the ccnitions of service for the force and if possible to use his influence to ensure that such improvements are adequate and are put into effect with the least possible delay. 4. I am dupding copies of this despatch to the United Kingdom Higli Commissioner, Pakistan, the British iddle East Office, the Senior ftaval Officer, Persian Gulf, the Group Captain, Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Muscat.

Mr.Latif was engaged for two years at a salary of Bs 240/-p.m. plus free rations and accommodation. He was not given a formal contract through Protector oi Emigrants,Karachi,but an offer was made to him by Minister for Foreign Affairs through a friend in Muscat,and it is fc considered that there was a binding contract following his acceptance of the offer.He arrived here on 24-3-50 receiving free second class accommodation for his wile and live cnii- dren.He put in a claim for Rs 671/2/9 for additional travel ling expenses,which was sanctioned for Rs 407/10/- only by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He then decided to return his wife and live children to Pakistan.and requested free passages and expen ses for them.He was informed that this would be granted n he gave a written undertaking that he would give 3 months notice should he not complete his contract and would refund the cost of the passages.He refused to &amp; ive this undertaking^ 3. When the Head clerk had proceeded on leave and Mr.Latif was the only clerk in the unit,he put an app lication for fifteen days leaye to go to Karachi to have treatment for a cataract in his eye.Mr. Latil had on±y completed two months in Muscat and he was informed that he could not be spared and that he could see Doctor.Thpmas who was expected in about a week’s time,in connection with his eye. Mr.Latif then made himself appear to be hav ing difficulty in reading documents,which we were unable to unaerstand,as,according to his statement,only one eye was affected. check of of th&lt; ca: which he was supposed to be entering,and he was even unaw are that items of ammunition were in i different ledgers to equipment.As a result a check of equipment at which a number of troops were present would have become a farce if the ledgers had not been token away from Mr.Latif.Mr.Latif was reprimended and the termination of his services were considered even in the absence of any other clerk.However on the next working day Mr.Latif submitted his resignation with a request for early release.ke accepted his resignation without notice,and he was paid up to and including 24th June 1950, the last day he worked, as we c^.n accept no . further liabilities in respect of personal resignat*^^ without notice,given a free passage to Karachi,plus Rs 91/4/- expenses to Lahore,and is due nothing further: here T vvith an intention of serving; alternatively his intention may have been to obtain the ma ximum in travelling expenses in as short a time as possibles Though we have received no further claims from Mr.Latif at present we understand, that he intends to claim Rs 589/6/- on the return passage of his family plus an unspecified amount in respect of compensation regarding the sale of a shop at Lahore.

MUSCAT.CUi^FI^TIiiL 112/1/50 The lersian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 5th January, 1950, CiyvJXju^ *5 1 am afraid I do not agree with tie proposal made in your letter No. 5/8/77/49 cf the 5th December, 1949, that you should write to the Muscat Government saying that you no longer require a ^uard. .at Bahrain police guards are provided at the expense of the Bahrain Govern ment for both the Besiaency ana the agency and at Kuwait there is a permanent guard of local Brabs which I think is provided by the Shaikh. When 1 was at Kabul a military guard was prov ided ior the Legation by the afghan Government. The muscat Government are responsible for the protection of the Political agency and although the place is at present peaceful this has not always been the case. I agree, however, that the Muscat infantry at present have to supply too many guards and should the muscat Govern ment wish to withdraw that on the agency l think they should be asked to provide something else, e.g. local police, in its place. , 1C J ! &gt; a * - if x&gt; Iuiuir\T» T&lt;‘ i' T</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100043872656.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/270B</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100043872656.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/270B</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/77 Muscat Infantry.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1950/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-27T22:17:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (88 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 90; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
