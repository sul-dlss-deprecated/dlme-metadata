Subject:- Maps - 1/500,000 Series - Sheet BASRA - KUWAIT. 1. With reference to your recent conversation with Captain F.B.Baines-Hewitt on the subject of the survey of KUWAIT and the KUWAIT NEUTRAL ZONE. The immediate object of the proposed survey, which, it is hoped, will he undertaken by the Air Headquarters Survey Party during the forthcoming survey field season (October 1932 - May 1933), is the production of a further sheet of the 1/500,000 series of South Western f IRAQ and KUWAIT. When complete, this series of maps will cover the whole of the desert country between the River EUPHRATES and the NAJD frontier and South of Latitude 34°N., and should meet the require ments of both the air and the ground user. In course of time the international 1/1,000,000 series sheets will be revised from the larger scale maps and new editions will be published. 2. The BASRA-KUWAIT Sheet is the fourth of the new series. Its Western margin v/ill be a a North and South line passing through the Eastern corner of the *IRAQ-NAJD Neutral Area; its Northern margin will be a line at right angles to the former and passing just North of UR. The sheet will include the whole of the territory of KUWAIT and of the Neutral Zone to the South thereof. 3. Although much more is known of the topography of KUWAIT than was the case four years ago, the information available is still scanty enough. It need not be emphasized that, before a detailed survey of a desert area is undertaken, it is desirable to have as much information as possible of both the geography and the topography of that area. The conditions under which the survey is carried out are such as to demand the strictest economy, in planning out the details of the work, and it is not possible for the surveyor to visit every acre of the country covered. Reliable information, before the survey starts, of the physical features of the area to be treated, may save the surveyor a great deal of time in the field as well as enhancing the value of the work he does during the time he actually spends on the field survey.4. In the present case, air requirements must also he considered. The dual role of the map makes it necessary to give careful thought to its value from the flying point of view and to direct the survey accordingly. The actual survey of the position of the physical features is the concern of the ground survey party, hut a decision as to the precise value, as landmarks from the air, of the various features encountered, is not always easy on the ground, and therefore the survey officer intends to make a number of air reconnaissances before starting the ground survey. It is also hoped that it will he possible for certain preliminary reconnaissances to he carried out by aircraft of No. 203 (Plying Boat) Squadron and No. 84 (Bomber) Squadron, who will approach you direct with regard to the flights to be made. 5. A sketch map, at 1/500,000 scale, of the territory of KUWAIT and the NEUTRAL ZONE, has been prepared and embodies the sum total of the inform ation at present available here. It is thought that you are certain to have acquired much additional topographical information in the course of various tours carried out during the last few years, and it would be very greatly appreciated if such information as you may have collected could be placed at the disposal of the Air Headquarters Survey Section. A copy of the sketch map mentioned above is forwarded with this letter and may be used as a basis for any notes which you may be able to furnish. You may like to amend the sketch map where it is in error and to add additional information which you think would be of value from the point of view of the survey. Alternatively, you may prefer to submit a separate sketch map of your own, or to send manu script notes. 6. Any information received will be of greater value if it can be studied here by the survey staff before the opening of the field season. It would, therefore, be greatly appreciated if any notes which you are able to submit could be forwarded so as to reach this Headquarters early in September.

The second survey party working on the north side of the Bay of Kuwait should finish in the course of another « week. 3* For your information, I visited Major Papworth *s camp, 10 miles South of Jebel Banaiya on the coast in the Hazaim region of the Neutral Zone, on 10-th November, and proceeded thence to Wafra, where I found a patrol of Ibn Jalouis under Ibn Shajaan camped on the wells. Ibn Shajaan told me he had been deputed to look after the Survey Party. I told Ibn Shajaan that Major Papworth had a sufficient escort from the Shaikh of Kuwait, and did not really require his party. Ibn Shajaan said he would report to Major Papworth the next day and then take his leave. This he did and, I believe, proceeded south again on 16th November. 4* I am afraid the real reason for Ibn Shajaan’s presence at Wafra was that he was hunting some Awazim contra band runners, and made the survey party an excuse for his- 2 Ms activities. He, no doubt, hoped to get from Major Papworth a share of the largesse, which the latter has been distributing. 5. From Wafra, I returned to Kuwait on 12th November having spent two nights in the desert, and done 205 miles over shockingly bad country.

As Murshid does not know any one in Basra, the Shaikh suggests and I think the idea good that you give him on arrival a round sum of money to enable him to make his own arrangements in the Town as regards boap and lodging. ■^ou can no doubt recover same from Papworth without difficulty. 4. I know you know all the ropes quite well, so forgive my suggesting how you should do these things, but I promised the Shaikh to write and tell you everything he suggested. 5. Lastly - do not let Papworth keep Murshid too long, as the Shaikh wants him to accompany Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa * of Bahrain on his various hunting expeditions. The latter is staying in Kuwait these days and will probably remain here some 25 days. 6.

Many thanks for your note of 10th December. Regarding your para 4. It may interest you to know that I read out what you said to Murshid who gave me your letter personally and in my office he repeated what he told you about the range of hills running south wards from Kuwait to Araifjan being celled ADAL. When I asked him where he had got that name from when the range of hills was known to everyone as A1 DHAHAR (the back) he hedged by saying that it was celled in full 'A1 Dhahar al Adal'. As I had never heard this name throughout my 5 years* sojourn here, I enquired the same day about the matter from the Shaikh himself, and told him what !,!urshid had told you and me. The Shaikh was highly amused, and said that Murshid was inventing from beginning to end . He insisted that the ridge was called 'Al Bhahar' only and that the word ADAL was entirely unknown throughout his State. Clearly, he said, Murshid being a Shammari and a stranger to local names, had got mixed up with the word AD AN, and having once said it was ADAL he did not kike going back on his statement. Actually,added the Shaikh, the Ridge possessed another name but this was only used by sailors. This was 'HAIB al BINT' or in Bedouin parlance 'the girl’s eyebrow'.

We have just heard from the Air Ministry that the Basrah-Kuwait sheet of the 1 : 500,000 ’Iraq Desert Series of maps, G-.S.G.S. 3954, will be available towards the end of September, 1936; under the same cover they forwarded us merely one proof copy. The Air Ministry also recently ruled that other departments should apply direct to the Geographical Section, General Staff, the War Office, London, and not through the local R.A.F. sources. As much as I would like to help you at once by loaning you a copy, the only one we have is the proof copy referred to above. I am sure you would, under the circumstances obtain a copy more quickly by applying direct to the G.S.G.S. London than awaiting our issue. F/Lt.
