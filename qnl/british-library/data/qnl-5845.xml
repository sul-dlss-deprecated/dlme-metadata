I have learnt some news from Haalr l)in 3aud ny representative who returned to me yesterday from Kuwait which news proves tliat the Uhelkh of Kuwait certainly changed aone words in my original letter o or hla and increased decreased cone f he then suh* Mitted the letter to Political Agent f Kuwait.

Secondly I sent my aforesaid cousin Hasir Bin aaud witli Bin ,iuhah f s messengers ir &gt; ord«r to imt out thw fir*,and gain th* satisfaction oi :is Majesty’s Covami«nt. When Nasir arrived at Kuwait he witnessad certain things which were most inpoper and unfair and which 1 dislike to sake a mention of;because of th* serious insult which resulted .

Sheikh Hamad reported the latest madness ( as he call- ed it )of Bin Baud was that he had issued strict orders to Bin Jilovi, Bmir of Hassa that in future the Bhiahs of Hassa and Qatif were to he forbidden to hold religious read ings (QARAIXAHS) in their Husseiniyehs and that at Muharram all cer®aonies in connexion with the death of Hussein were to he banned. 'The order**, said Bheikh Hamad, had created the greatest consternation and fury among Hassa and Qatif Shiahs. Unless the order were rescinded, Bhaikh Hamad fcfaanarg thought rebellion was sure to follow. Certainly an appeal to Great Britain would be made t^Bhiahs. It w^s a similar policy in Paisal f s time that brought about Turkish inter vention in Hassa, and now Bin Baud was mad enough to try and imitate his grandfather f s mistake. Bheikh Jumaa spoke in similar strain saying how alarm . od the people of Dabai were at Bin Saud^ increasing power Bheikh admitted that near Basalt Khainah there existed a strong Wahhabi centre today. These were in direct communi cation with Bin Baud, and were becoming a menace to the peace of the Trucial coast. Sheikh Hamad further reported that a section of the AJman had been bribed by Bheikh Balem to leave ibn Hath- lajb^s camp and go into Koweit territory. See my fr) IiOatcilrant section tiad emerged on 10th instant and ri raided a camp of the Hanasir close to (Jatif, retuminr, in safety with ipany camels. 2. A significant fact is that Sheikh Hamad until a short time was a hot supporter of Bin Baud. Since Bin Shamlan from Koweit visited Bahrein Sheikh Hamad has changed his politics. In this connection please see ay story with suspicion. At the same time, undoubtedly Jheikh Salem is intriguing deeply in these parts, his endeavours Being to create an Anti- Bln Jaud atmosphere in Bahrein. Honey judiciously spent in Qatif might easily result in an outbreak, for the qatifi Shiah is not particularly fond of the Bin Baud regime. In this connection also see Koweit f s telegram No^V-C, dated 1920 in which he reports likely trouble in Hassa. The report emanated from Jheikh Balem and looks as if it was a case of the || wish father of the thought. Apart from Bheikh Hamad and Sheikh Abdullah f 3 reports, I have hear! of no such alleged orders of Bin Baud against the Bhiahs complained of. Nor have any local Bhiahs mentioned it to me here. (3) Local rumour has it that Bln Bhamlan presented £ 0,000/-to Bheilch Isa froi oheikh Balem. I donot credit the report. A more lUcely stoay ia that the raoney was seat _ Major, C.I.Ji..

Finally that His Honour Sir Arnold Wilson,*.C.I.E, had instructed your Honour to inform me that he agreed to appoint an arbitrator early in the autum to give a decision in all out standing questions in the matter of territorial disputes existing between me and Ibn Subah ,provided I undertook beforehand to accept the following condltions:- Firstly. That I should accept during the whole of my life time on behalf of myself and my people the decision which will be passed by the arbitrator appointed by His Majesty Government. Secondly. That I should state in writing as priliminary to negotiations exactly what I considered to be the boundaries between my dominions and those of Ibn Subah ,that I should mention as far as I could any land-marks,names of wells ,mountains, or grazing land etojand whether such narks fall within my bounda ries or not or were considered as Joint property by both myself and Ibn Subah. Further more in giving this information I was to mention the grounds and proofs on which I based my claims. Thirdly.

They are not very easy as to how the Bedouins within the walls will behave in the even'k of an attack, and some also doubt the Najdia. I strongly recommend that if possible we send aeroplanes to bomo the Ikhwan at Subaihiyah, They would be quite new to them and a few bombs would probably be enough t 6 disperse them. If as he si ys Ibn 3a *ud has y prohibited any attack on Jahrah or Kuwait he cannot blame us for punishing his subjects who defy his own order. It would certainly raise our prestige here enormously and allay the bitterness mentioned in my telegram No, 12 ^-G which is growing daily.

Copy to High Coiamissioner, M H P. A., Bahrain.1 THE litflWAiM AxtAGk. OH jAriKAa. on the alternoon of the Hth October one of Shaikh Salim 1 s spiee arrived in Kuwait with a report that a large force of Ikhwan had ]»ft Wafran at sunset the previous evening for Subaihiyah. He was unable to estimate their numbers as he only saw them from a considerable distance, but he said it was obvious that they were not an ordinary raiding party. This information was confirmed the following day by a member of a Bedouin patrol, which had been captured by them near Wafrah late in the evening of the 7th October. His companions had been killed and he himself left for dead, but, although badly wounded he managed to get into Kuwait. Shaikh Salim was at Janrah at the time as on the 7th October r* had received a report, which proved to be without foundation, of a Janrah. As soon as he received this information he made preparations for the defence of Janran. paraleliogram, the longer sides of which are about Ipuo yards long and face south-west and north-east respectively. To the south-east of the village, and only separated by a roadway from the nearest walled garden, is tne fort. This is about eighty yards square,and has towers over tne doorway and at the corners which give a rudimentary flank defence. The walls are fifteen feet high and two feet thick at the top - probably four feet at the base -, the towers being about eight feet higher. The village is intersected by numerous mud wails, which give good cover from view and some cover from fire. The fight started at 6 a.m. on the lotn October. The Kuwait force was holding the south-west face of the village,with Ibn Tawalah and his mounted Shammar on tne right flank, and Da*ij*s norsemen on tne left. The Iknwan launched their attack on tne western end of tne position, which was held by the Janran villagers, and, after routing ibn Tawalah, turned the position from the north-west. Da*ij was prevented from rendering any assistance by a superior body of mounted ikhwan, and *AlI al-Khalifan, wno was commanding the , nuwait hostile concentration at Tawai wells, two days - Journey west of The village of Janran, including its gardens, forms a rough//£&gt; ^ Kuwait contingent retired and foriaed to tne rignt. ay nine o'clock the entire village was in tne hands ol tne Ikhwan, and Snaikh Salim, with tne otner snaikhs and about six hundred men, was shut up in tne fort, tne rest of his force being dispersed. xn tne afternoon Dawlsh sent a message to Snaikh Salim offer ing peace if he would renounce ail claim to tne camels, etc. wnich tne iknwan nad taken, and would evacuate tne fort, but Snaikh Salim refused. Three determined attacks were made on tne fort during tne night. meanwhile, very great nervousness was evident in Kuwait, and the wildest rumours were current. An attack on Kuwait was feared at any minute, and every available man was sent to man tne walls. on tne morning of tne 1 *tn October Snaikh Ahmad ai-oaoir, who was in command in Kuwait, organised and despatched a relief force some six hundred strong, oy sea, in tne Shaikh s launch ;i Misnrif*‘ and a few sailing boats, At tne same time Ion TawSian , wno had fled to Kuwait tne previous day, went out by road. before these reinforcements arrived, however, Dawlsh sent in * ^ with definite proposals of peace. The aiim said that they nad ail been very much surprised to hear tne garrison of tne fort praying like Muslims, as they had always been led to suppose tnat tne people of Kuwait were infidels, and tnat, if tney really were musllms, it snouid be quite easy to nake peace between tnem. he then demanded tnat Shaikh Salim snouid put down ail smoking, drink- mg, gamoling and prostitution m Kuwait. Snaikh Salim replied tnat he too disapproved of ail these things, and that he was quite willing to prohibit their being done openly by his subjects, ne could not, however, ue responsible for what people did in their own houses, nor could he be responsible for tne action of foreign ers wno were not under his control. Tne question of tne camels and otner loot then came up, Snaikh Salim agreeing not to interfere with the ikhwan if they xeft everything which tney had taken. The 'aiim . on tne otner hand, maintaining tnat as tney had taken it in war tney had a perfect right to take xt with tnem. ne eventually said that ne was not authorised to agree to Snaikh SaiiuMs demand himself/ /' n2\ hiiiifleif, out tliat he would discuss tne matter with DawTsn* ne J Lhen withdrew and went off towards Dawlsh's oeat,, wnicn was to the north-west of tae village, (iae ongiaai report txiat the ikhwan agreed to return tae booty is untrue), bnortiy after this tae ikhwan moved off, taking everything with taem, and without any further fighting. They marched tnree xiours tnat day and halted, and tne following day moved on to Subainiyan, wnere tney still are. On taie Wtn October Dawisn sent in a letter to Snaikn Salim asking that filial ai-Mutairl, iiow one of the biggest merchants in Kuwait, should be sent out to Subaihiyan to treat with him regardiag a settlement of tne dispute. The Shaikh refused and replied that If Dawlsn wanted to discuss anything with him, no suouia send ±&amp; one of ohe Dushan family into Kuwait.The messenger who brought this letter was a Kuwait slave, who was captured at hamdh, near Jariyah, in i/iay and was given his life on condition that he Joined the Ikhwan* it is difficult to form an accurate estimate of the number of ikhwan involved. From the early reports received in Kuwait I put the number at about 1400, but after personally visiting Jahrah and seeing the dead on the ground and the graves of those buried, I see that there must have been far more, and think there cannot have been less than 3000. I estimate their killed alone at bOO. Shaikh Salim and others who were present put their number at 4o00, usually saying that there were four bairaq s. with a thousand men to each. The messenger, referred to above, stated while in Kuwait that they originally numbered 4000, of whom between 700 and SOO were killed at Jahrah and over 800 severely wounded, of which latter quite half died before they reached Subaihiyah. Oh'reaching Subaihiyah their effective strength was not more than IpOO, but they found 300 re inforcements awaiting them there, and had subsequently been Joined by 2oo more. These latter, camel riders, he described as coming back from the north. The Kuwait force is said to have only lost about 2oo killed, very few of whom were actual inhabitants of Kuwait. This small number in comparison with the Ikhwan losses, is due to the fact that the Ikhwan attacked across the open in masses, and showed the most utter disregard for his own safety.On the 16th October Dawlfih sent In envoys to Kuwait to dis cuss terms for a settlement of the dispute. In accordance with the ordinary custom, they were £iven tint® to rest before stating their mission, and Shaikh Salia had not seen them by the evening of 1£th October* Their terns, however, i;re knovm, and are totally impossible for him to accept, being in fact a demand that Shaikh ✓ Salla and the people of Kuwait should becoras IMiwan forthwith, :jvl that fron now onwards they should be friends to their friends and foea to their foes. Dawish apparently says he oan accent no other teras hlaself, and, as he puts it, he cannot thread a needle without Ibn Sa'ud's approval* There accordingly seems nothing; for it but war, and everything seeas to Indicate that an attack on Kuwait really is intended. A representative of the Shalidi, who aocoapanied the former messengers back to Subalhlyah and returned with the present envoys, estimates the Ikhwan's present effective strength at bug horse and at least juoo foot. Large reinforcements were said to be coming. There oan, of course, be no real security until friendly relations be established with Ibn 3a'ud, which can only be after tue .rbitratlon on the Boundary dispute tukes place, and I aa constantly being asked when this is going to take place.A certain amount of bitterness is felt against us by the local inhabitants - even amongst those who by no means love Shaikh 3 aiia - for, as they say heaping honours on Ibn 3a'ud .and supplying him with large sums of noney and vith arms filch he uses against Kuwait. The present situation is extremely serious. Ibn Sa'ud oan do nothing to put matters right in the immediate future, even if Dawiah has acted contr ry to his wishes, as Riyadh is a far cry to Subaihiyah. Jahrah has been evacuated and Kuwait is to all intents and purposes besieged on the land aide. The people are nervous; they all think an attack is bound to take place, and they are not /ary easy _n their ainds as to how the numerous Bedouin now within th ° w ' Uo vi:i b * bav * - “oao also are suspicious of the Najdia. Another probable Result and one which seems far from desirable is that many outside Bedouin will become Ikhwan to save trouble. I consider the only way of averting an attack would be for us to 5endam ■D fmmmmmmmm. //3 ^ to sand aeroplanes to tomb them at Subalhlyah. This wou t js entirely new to them and I am of opinion that a very fev bombs would be sufficient to diapers® them. It would enormously lncr®.-oe our prestise, and that of Ibn 3a*ud too M. aotsd 1x1 dir30t defiance of his orders. If, on the other hand, Ibn Sa'ud oruer ;d the attach it would tend to discredit him, which, in that case, would seem most deolrabl®* I O— 1From Folitioai, Kuwait.
