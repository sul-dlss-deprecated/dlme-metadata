Mr. Knabenshue brought with him his Secretary, Mr.J.S.Moose, who said that he nau spent much time learning Arabic both in Paris and Beyrout. He aid not seem to oncerstana Shaikh Hamad, nor Shaikh Hamad him, but that is not unlikely as the Arabic spoken here is not easily followea by the people who speak the debased(l) tongues of Syria and Egypt. 3. Mr. Moose is describee as T Moose T on his passport, byt admits that his real name is 'Mosevitch' (I am not sure of the spelling) and he claims that Mosevitch is German. 4. I confess to some doubts about this indiviaual and, as it seems probable that Mr. Knabenshue will repeat his attempt to see King Bin Sa'ud, 1 venture to suggest that it might be sound to try to trace something of Mr. Moose's ante cedents, through the Consul-General at Beyrout. Mr. Moose was, I understand, in Beyrout with Mr. Knabenshue when the latter was Uniteu States' Consul there.

Minister at Baghdad) visit to Bahrain in March 1944. Mr. Henderson the American Minister in Baghdad arrived here in L.T. ’’Nearchus” on the 17th of March. Sse F2£S2355rl T AgS&amp;t offered to accommodate both the Minister and Mr. Fletcher, the American Consul from Basrah who accompanied him, at the Agency, but owing to a previous arrangement with Mr. Anderson General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited they declined the invitation and stayed at the Bahrain Petroleum Company's settlement at Awali. 2. In company with the Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Lloyd. N. Hamilton, and Mr. Ward Anderson, I met the Minister on his arrival. The same evening I gave a dinner party at the Agency at Awali in his honour to which were invited his hosts^and the leading members of the British and American community in Manama. 3. On the 18th I took Mr. Henderson to call on the Shaikh at the Qadabiyah House and His Highness returned the call at the Agency the same morning. After His Highness' return call I had an opportunity for private conversation with Mr. Henderson and Mr. Fletcher. 4. Mr. Henderson said that he was worried about the attitude of the Berchtel-McCone-Parsons Corporation employees. He enquired what the machinery was for the trial and punishment of persons who were not subject to the authority of the Bahrain courts. This was explained to him clearly and concisely and he was informed that persons sentenced by the Agency courts could be transferred to India to serve their term. It was obvious to the Minister that although the machinery was present and in theory the procedure was simple in practice there would be many difficulties to overcome and much time would have to be spent before an American citizen found himself in Karachi serving a sentence of imprisonment at the expense of the Government of India. I informed the Minister that it was hoped that American Army Provost Personnel would shortly arrive and that they would /dealdeal adequately with any bickering that might take place. Mr. Henderson said that it was wrong that American citizens should be able to commit crimes and go not only unpunished but he given distinct advantages over their more industrious and well-behaved fellows by being flown to the United States. The Company’s policy at present is to saying nothing and fly bad characters out as quickly as possible. 5. The Minister enquired what my reaction would be if it were possible to make the employees of the B.M.P. Corporation subject to American Military Law. He explained that this has been done in various parts of the world and in particular in Iraq and that it would then be possible to arrest and try by American Courts Martial anyone committing a crime. The advantage5of the system vS»fb that firstly bad hats do not go gcot-free, secondly the local police and the Political autho rities were not called upon to spend valuable time in prosecutirg and trying American offenders, and thirdly should an individual be convicted he could be ’’taken care of” in the American prison at IChorramshahr or in one of the State penitentiaries in the United States and would be removed to these establishments without any inconvenience to the Bahrain Government or the Political Agency and at the expense of the United States Govern ment. I informed the Minister that I could give no official answer without consulting the Hon'ble the Political Resident and he replied to the effect that he was not asking an official question and had no power so to do, for he suspected that the American Government’s agreement with the B.M.P. Corporation would be so worded as to preclude any attempt to place their employees under military law but that he would like to know my private reaction. I said that my private opinion was that k an arrangement such as he had suggested would appear to solve what might prove to be a serious problem. /Mr- I3 lur. Henderson informed me that he had suggested to Hr. Hamilton and Mr. Anderson that they should discuss the matter informally with General Connolly on their forthcoming visit to Tehran and obtain his views. If there was any intention of proceeding with the matter Mr.Anderson would raise the question with me and then it could be carefully gone into. 6 . Mr. Henderson left for Dhahran on the afternoon of the 18th and returned on the afternoon of the 20th after having visited the Arabian American Oil Company installations both at A1 Khobar and Ras Tanurah. On the afternoon of the 20th shortly after he had visited the American Arabian Mission Hospital he had tea with me. The conversation during tea was quite informal and on this occasion Colonel Converse u.o. Military Attache* at Baghdad and Mr. Fletcher were also present. Colonel Converse flew down to Bahrain on the 16th to be present on. the Minister's arrival. Mr. Henderson left Bahrain on the 21st for Baghdad by Bahrain, 21st March 1944. ^ Political Agent, Bahrain.

On Firday she told Mrs.Loch that the Minister had heard that Bin Sa’ud was to go on the Hajj and consequently'that he might try to go up to Riyadh at once.

Letter dated 4th March 1934 to Mr.Skinner. Telegram No: 171 of 4th March 1934 to P.R,S of S,G- of I and Minister,Jeada. On the evening oi the 4th March 1934 Mr.Skinner came round to the Agency as soon as he had received my P.bl. letter of that evening,and told me that he knew very little about the coming of the United States* Minister. He said that Lr.Nomland had promised the United States* Minister the use of the Company*s cars to go up to Riyadh,but that he (Mr.Skinner) thought that when Doctor Nomland made this oiler {which was apparently made when he passed through Baghdad) he did not appreciate the kind of country and the ditiiculty of making cars available. 2. It appears that the United States* Minister wrote recently to Mr.Skinner (I am not clear when Mr.Skinner got the letter) and Mr.Skinner telegraphed to him on the 3rd March (or it may have been a day or so earlier) saying that there would be considerable difficulty in arranging the cars and that at least one week*s notice would be necessary. I gather that he genuinely discouraged the Minister from his project and drew attention to the lact that he would need an inviiation from Bin Sa*ud. It seems that Mr.Skinner was aware of the date,lbth March,for Bin Sa*ud*s leaving lor the Eedjaz. 3. On the wnole I am inclined to think that the position as regards tne invitation is genuine,that is to say,that Mr.Skinner gave the Minister an invitation when he was m Baghdadjthat the Minister may have intended to stay with Mr.Skinner so that on receiving my telegraphic invitation through Consul,Basrah,he merely replied that he hadpromisee! to stay witii Mr.Siunner,tftougii he had,so far as I can tell,not already communicated actual dates to Mr. Skinner (it is,however,a little difiicult to reconcile this with Mr.Skinner T s having received a letter from the Minister) and oi the fact that apparently Dotn the Mission and the Oil Company were aware of the project but said nothing about it is curious.

Hesiaent's Printed LettervNo:3yy-S of 4ttt Maron 1934.The United States Minister in 'Iran (His Excellency Paul Knabenshue) came to call at the Agency, Bahrain, on Uednedday the 7th March 1334, at twelve o'clock. He was accompanied by his Secretary, Mr Moos Q , and both were introduced by Mr Skinner, the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Mrs Loch sat on a sofa with His Excellency, and the following conversation (approximately) took place. 1. The journey by slow mail to Bahrain. H.E. had liked it and the sea had been smooth. H.E. said he was a pood sailor and generally, but not always, survived a voyaje. 2. The opening up of the Arab Coast, and the coast beyond Masqat was discussed 5 H.E. declared that this was done by Air, quoting the A.O.C. Baghdad (Burnett) and the Air Commodore (Cunningham) - both by name. Colonel Loch remarked that the 'Tar had opened up the country - this sur prised them, and they agreed. 3. T ji is led to pge speaking of Arabic , His Ex. said he spoke none, had never learnt, although he had been for 23 years in the East - had started his career in Ireland (?) where he had married his wife - a lady from County Down \ subsequently he had been in Egypt (1911-19) Palestine and Syria - now in 'Iraq, where for the first time he feels he would like to be able to talk to the 'Iraqi officials - the only Arabs he meets* then turned to Mr Moose and told us that he had had three years study on the School of Oriental Languages ‘n Paris. (I asked if they there taught Syrian Arabic and they said Yes.) -His Ex. then said chaffin'lv that Mr Moose's Ararabic was now being put to the test (leather for the first time). The person he sees most of in Baghdad is the Foreign Minister j he is a friend of Nuri Pasha and thinks Nuri will come back. He says -he likes to see the infuence of 'your people' (presumably British) on the vou King, and added that he had become much more in clined to 11 stan - *to advice since coming to the throne - and being less with the wilder and less responsiole younp men of ' Iraq. Tt e Queen has received his wife, as well as other Diplomatic ladies, and talks Turkish and Arabic. 4 ). His son has just left Haileybury and his daughter is spending a term, with her people, away from Roedean. His wife does not like Baghdad. 5. He is in process of building a new Legation, and is building, with it, a swimming pool of which he is proud. 6. Sir Francis H^mphrys had told him that the visit of the Shah is postponed. King Faisal was building a new Palace, or-Quest - House, to receive him, and that is to be occupied by the young King. 7. He remarked that he (Knabenshue) was a supporter of our rule - he ias all out for co-operation - and it was a treat pity the Mandate was given up so soon. 'wp-sa©* ~T~ tNo:39.

He said that he greatly admired bur work in the Persian Gulf and adjacent areas and that anything that they could ao to support it would be done. He emphasised that we had spent T, lives and treasure” m producing a state ot alfairs which made it possible ior the American Oil Companies to carry on the work which they are doing now. He emphasised that he was down here under our ’’auspices” and was particularly anxious not to intrude on our special position. After some further remarks he led the conversa- tion round to the Standard Oil Company ol California’s aeroplane saying that he did not intend to mention the matter to the Shaikh as he realised that any approaches should be made through us,but that his Government had told him that they were again raising the question and he hoped that if it was placed before us m the Gulf again we would be sympathetic. He said that they only wanted to use Bahrain for the aeroplane for medical purposes. He said that they had a number of parties out on the mainland and that some of them were bound to be sick and that at Bahrain was the nearest American Hospital.
