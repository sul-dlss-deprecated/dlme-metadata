Proposed sale of the Uehdy land at Bushire. ~i Sir, I am directed to address you in connection with a proposal to sell the Hehdy lahd at Bushire which was originally purchased in 1905 and 1911 at a total cost of Rs.12,610/- for the construction of new residences for the Political Resident kis staff. Owing however, to the prohibitive cost, the ^ i building scheme was not proceeded with. In 1915 a bungalow and office for the Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf was built on a portion of this site at an estimated cost of Rs. 23,522/-, 2 * It will be seen from the correspondence noted in the MTgoflfandlfllTTT&amp;m the Hoh'ble the Poll tlC^al~ 'Resident in the Persian Gulf, 3J0.1787, dated the 2nd August 19 30, and 2. memorandum to the Hon*tie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Fo.

P- ^ I Proposed sale of the Nehdy land at Bushire. Reference Foreign and Political Department meriforandum 400-A/30, dated the 13th Septemoer 1930. I have consulted His Majesty’s Cnarge d’Affair^at Tehran regarding the proposed sale of the Hehdy land at Bushire and have been informed in reply that he can see no objection to the proposal. I do not hcwever recommeno that the plot on which the bungalow of the Assistant Engineer, Public Works Departmen is built should be sold until a definite decision has been • arrived at regarding the transfer of the Residency, which presumably is conditional on a satisfactory outcome to the treaty negotiations. I should, however, be glad of orders regarding the sale of the remainder of the land. In view of the present serious economic crisis in Persia, I doubt whether it will be possible to obtain a reasonable price for the land just now. If, however, the sale is sanctioned I will try and dispose of it as and when opportunity offers.

I have carefully reviewed the budget grants of this Residency and, in consultation with the officers concerned, also thpee of Agencies and Consulates under my control, and regret to say that the existing fcate of expenditure does not appear to be susceptible of reduction in any direction. As the Government of India are aware the standard of expenditure sanctioned in forithe Gulf is considerably lower than that sanctioned in India; it is only within the last two or three months that, for instar&gt; ce, the clerical establishment of the Persian Gulf have been placed more or less on an equality with their confreres in India despite the arduous conditions under which they are call-ed on to serve. Further, in some eases the office allowance grants are still based on the pre-war rate of expenditure and excesses have been incurred almost every year despite of strictest economy and proposals are now under consideration of the Government of India to put them on a proper footing. 3. In this connection, however, and in view of the present financial stringency, I would invite a reference tr O 6607 om - The Hon t ble the Political Resident 1 ,19 30 in the Persian Gxnrf^ —- To * The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, SIMLA.

The question of the transfer of the Bushire Residency is still under consideration, but even should it be ultimately decided that it is to remain at Bushire, I do not think that the site purchased at hlehdy would be suitable for the new Residency. I agree generally with the views expressed in paragraph 4 of Sir Frederick Johnston's letter No. 747, dated the 26th March 1929, as to the unViealthiness of a site so close to the town and consider it would be preferable to moire the present town office out to Subzabad and acquire land for the purpose in the vicinity of the present Residency. The only office which it would be necessary to retain in town would be the Vice-Consul's Office, since he deals with commercial work and issues passports, etc*£t is unnecessary to go into details of the matter at present, but 1 have »earty mentioned it to show that in any case I do not think it likely that the Nfchdy land will ever be utilised for the purpose for which it was originally purchased. I would suggest, therefore, that it be sold and the proceeds credited to Government. •“V £4/- H.V.

Consequently the Cypher Clerk, and otner establishment who are required to work daily in Sabzabad have to come out each morning from Bushire. There are no horse drawn vehicles which can be hired at a cheap rate and there is no system of public omnibus conveyance. The residences of the staff who are not accommodated in Sabzabad are strung out over the intervening space between Sabzabad and Bushire. The Secretary has a house near the site under reference, about 5 miles from Sabzabad. The Residency Surgeon resides some 2b miles from Sabzabad. Telephone communication under Persian direction is always uncertain and ceases altogether at nine at night. A more unsatisfactory arrangement or one less conducting to efficiency of administration it would be difficult to imagine. 3. There undoubtedly was a time when Bushire formed a suitable and convenient headquarters for the Residency, but with the changes that have occurred in Persia in recent years and the further changes that seem bound to come, it seems very much open to argument whether the suitability and convenience are^now at an end. With the high Persian duties on practically all commodities the cost of living has been forced up to a price which will necessitate the grant of very substantial allowances to all establishment in Bushire. Owing to Persian passport regulations the Resident is cut off from any visitors from the Arab Coast. Eis duties as Consul-General have shrunk to such a degree that they could adequately be performed by the Vice-Consul, certainly by a Consul. Telegraph charges are high and owing to thesnr being only a weekly - in some cases fortnigntly mail to India and the Arabian Coast, practically all work of any importance is done by telegram. The presence in Bushire of an official drawing much higher pay than the GovernorGovernor is not relished hy the Persians who may be relied on, sooner or later, by a policy of pin pricks, which they are in a most favourable position to impose v/ithout laying themselves open to diplomatic representation, to manifest their dissatisfaction in a manner which would make conditions of living here undignified and insupportable. All these conditions are absent in Karachi and I oan see no reason why the Resident in the Persian Gulf should not live in Karachi, which is the London of the Gulf, just as suitably as the Agent to the Governor General, Punjab States, lives in Lahore. 4. I have, however, had an opportunity of discussing this matter at Delhi and, as I understand that the Government of India regard it as essential that the Resident should live at Bushire and Shiraz, which incidentally is not within his charge, as the Consul at Shiraz is not under him, it seems unnecessary to labour the matter further. The question would therefore appear to fine down to whether the present unsatisfactory conditions in Bushire are to be allowed to continue and what is to be done with the land purchased in 1905 and 1911 for the construction of a new Residency. The selection of that land m the days before mechanical transport was a compromise between 4 the unhealthiness of Bushire and the distance from Sabzaoad. Experience has, however, shown that the site is too near the town of Bushire to be free from the malaria prevalent in tnat town. The residents of the Secretary and Executive Engineer’s bungalows have suffered from fever in a markedly greater degree than those who live further out towards Sabzabad, admittedly the most healthy place. The distance xrom the town is too great to obviate the inconvenience of separation. I T would certainly deprecate the erection of any residency on this site. I would in fact deprecate the outlay of any further expenditure in Bushire until an opportunity has been afforded of very careful reconsideration of the policy of the Residents . . remainingremaining here. The present difficulties of communication can to a certain extent he tided over hy the provision of an efficient motor transport service between Bushlre and Sahzahad, for sanction to which I would ask that the Secretary of State he approached forthwith. 5* meanwhile 1 recommend that the land under reference he sold at once.

The suggestion that an efficient motor transport service should he provided between Bushire and Suhzahad is unsupported by detailed reasons and estimates of the cost involved, and the Government of India will be glad of both if the Resident considers it necessary to proceed further with the suggestion. 3d/- V.Narahari Rao, Under Secretary to the Government of India.
