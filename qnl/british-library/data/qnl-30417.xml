C/O, Balireln Petrolemti Coy., Ltd., Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, 13th Oct., 1936. The Suh-Iudc©, Sub-Judge*s Court, Hoakhali Dist. Sir, IJOilEY SUIT NO. 162-Misc. of 1936. I beg to bring to your honour’s kind notice that the date in the above case was fixed for re-hearing on 26th September, 1936. As I had to leave home on the 13th September 1936, to enable me to keep up my post secured with Messrs. Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrein Island, as per their letter dated 24th August, 1936, which reached me on the 9th of September, I was not in a position to be present in your honour’s Court on the date fixed, foreseeing this, I, along with my pleader (Mr. S. N* Sur) interviewed your honour on the 11th September 1936, for a commisiion, but your honour very kindly assured me through Mr. Sur that a long adjournment suitable to me would be granted. I have now joined my duties with my employers at Bahrein, and could, at ease arrange to record my statement with British Political Agent who exercises Judicial Power also. I therefore request your honour to kindly do me the favour of communicating with the British Political Agent Bahrein, to record my state ment and forward to your honour’s office for necessary action, for which act of kindness I shall ever remain grateful. I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant,1 FROM:- M. A. Ji^BAR. fir”' c/o, Bahrein Petroleum Coy., Ltd., Bahrein Island, April 22, 1937. r-i His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following I, as per copy of my application attached, filed a 'DECREE SEr-A-SIDE w case in the Sub-Judged court, Noakhali Dist:, Bengal on the 28th August 1936, hearing date of which was fixed for 26th of September 1936. Owing to my sudden departure for Bahrein to join this Company I was not able to get my statements recorded personally on the date fixed. I, before my departure for Bahrein applied for a commission and although my request was not granted assurances were given that arrange ments will be made in due course for my statements to be recorded in the presence of H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrein. Accordingly on arrival here I reminded the court concerned to forward the case to you for my statements, also reminded my pleader, Mr* H. K. Sur to take necessary action (copy of my application to the Sub-Judge is attached). I also written very many letters to Mr. sur since. During November last the pleader (Mr. Sur) intimated me that my request was sanctioned, followed by a cablegram asking me to remit cost of commission. The required sum was remitted on December 8th, 1936. Since I have written numerous letters to Mr. Sur who had neither the courtesy to acknowledge the receipt of the amount nor answer any of my letters. However, on the 14th March 1937 I again wrote to him inquiring the reason of the unusual delay and in reply, as per his letter dated 25th March 1937 he advised me to compromise, also wrote as per extract below:- ?.? 4^1 ‘ f) fC tu*.- £ D n The British Political Agent has returned the cpmmission as the questions were framed in English on the ground that the court language there is Arabic. So we shall have to frame the questions in Arabic and if the matter is taken up by the Translator of the High Court it will cost you much. Therefore on the 22nd I gave the court an understanding that we shall translate the questions through the help of an English knowing Maulvi at a less cost. The case has been adjourned in the 5th April. After the questions are submitted in Arabic, they will be sent back to the Political Agent for your deposition'. I am rather inclined to doubt the statement of my pleader and I should be extremely grateful if you would kindly let me know whether the • position of the case is as stated by my pleader or otherwise. Thanking you in anticipation. st obediently, I &amp; fP*- .Bo. 395/J. Political Agency, Bahrain, the Slat May 1937. Memorandum# Reference to his petition dated the 22nd May 1937 .

ON 28TH OCTOBER 1936,HE WROTE ME ADVISING HOW TO RE PRESENT THE CASE BEFORE THE POLITICAL AGENT AT BAHREIN, AND NO MENTION WHATSOEVER WAS MADE IN THIS LETTER FOR A COMPROMISE. IN HIS SUBSEQUENT LETTER DATED 25TH MARCH 1937, HE WRITES THAT ALL ALONG HE ADVISED ME TO COMPROMISE THE CASE AID SINCERELY WISHES ME TO DO IT LEST I SHOULD SUFFER. FURTHERMORE, HE STATES IN THAT LETTER THAT I AGREED TO ARRIVE AT AN UNDER STANDING FOR A SUM OF RS.4,300/- WHICH IS A CLEAR MYTH. MAY BE THERE IS SOMETH ING BEHIND THIS; I SUSPECT SOME FOUL PLAY - MY PLEADER'S JOINING HANDS WITH THE OPPOSITE PARTY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT JUST ON HIS PART, AS A LAWYER, ENGAGED BY ME TO PLEAD ON MY BEHALF, TO SOUND THE CO MPROMISE, IF SO HE DEEMED IT, AT LEAST AT THE TIME OF PAYING CHARGES FOR THE COMMISSION IF NOT AT THE TIME OF TAKING UP THE CASE. YOUR HONOUR COULD NOTICE THAT HIS LETTER DATED 25TH, 1937 - E.8 - INFORMING ME THAT THE COMMISSION WAS SENT TO HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN AND THAT IT WAS RETURNED BECAUSE THE COURT LANGUAGE IN BAHREIN IS ARABIC ETC., IS BUT A PREMEDITATED ART.

WITH KINDEST REGARDS, SINCERELY YOURS, X t » T VFROM:- M. A. JABBAR BAHREIN ISLAND, MARCH 14, 1937. DEAR MR. SUR, SINCE MY DEPARTURE FOR THIS ISLAND I HAVE WRITTEN YOU VERY MANY LETTERS, MOST OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED. I KNOW NO REASON OF YOUR SILENCE. A BRIEF LETTER FROM YOU DURING LAST DEC. WAS RECEIVED, THAT TOO AFTER WRITING YOU REPEATEDLY. A SUM OF RS. 50/- WAS REMITTED TO YOU ON RECEIPT OF YOUR CABLEGRAM TO MEET THE COSTS OF COMMISSION. YOU HAVE NEITHER ACKNOWLEDGED NOR GIVEN ME ANY DETAILED INFORMATION. COULD THIS BE ATTRIBUTED TO MY UTTER MISFORTUNE OR YOUR IRREGULARITIES IN COMMUNICATING TO YOUR CLIENTS. IT WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT AS SOON AS THE DECREE SET-ASIDE CASE WAS SANCTIONED FOR RE-HEARING MY BANK ACCOUNT WOULD BE RE LEASED. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU HAVE SUBMITTED NECESSARY PETITION ALONG WITH MY APPLICATION TO THE COURT FOR THE RELEASE OF THE ATTACHED MONEY. I NOW UNDERSTAND THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A LETTER FROM MY BROTHER THAT YOU HAVE NOT DONE THIS. AS A LAWYER WAS IT NOT YOUR DUTY TO SET THINGS RIGHT? I SHOULD THANK YOU TO LET ME KNOW THE REASON OF YOUR IGNORING SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT. HOWEVER I SHALL BE GLAD IF YOU WILL, WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY SUBMIT THE NECESSARY PETITION TO THE COURT AND HAVE MY BANK ACCOUNT RELEASED, INTIMATING ME IN THE USUAL WAY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN DONE. FURTHERMORE I HEAR THROUGH MY BROTHER THAT YOU WISHED HIM TO WRITE TO ME TO COMPROMISE WITH THE ANTI-PARTY. YOU, NOT AS A LAWYER BUT AS A WELL-WISHER SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS EITHER BEFORE TAKING UP THE CASE OR AT LEAST JUST BEFORE SUBMITTING THE COSTS TOWARDS COMMISSION. WOULD IT NOT BE A FOOLISHNESS TO DO SUCH THINGS AFTER WASTING ENERGY AND MONEY? IF YOU HAD SUCH POINT IN VIEW YOU OUGHT NOT HAVE TAKEN UP THE CASE. I DO NOT NOW THINK 17 IS FAIR ON YOUR PART TO ASK ME TO COMPROMISE. IT IS NOW ALMOST THREE MONTHS THAT THE COSTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE COURT BUT THE CASE HAS NOT, UPTO THE TIME OF WRITING RECEIVED IN THE OFFICE OF THE BRITISH POLITICAL AGENT HERE. I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR VIEWS ON THE UNUSUAL DELAY. I AM RATHER AT DARK TO KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE FINANCIALLY HANDICAPPED AND IF SO WOULD REQUEST YOU TO LET ME KNOW AND THE REQUIRED AMOUNT WILL BE REMITTED. C0NTD.2FROM:- HARENORA KUMAR M.L.A. SUR, B.L., BENGAL* NOAKHALt 9 DATED 25TH MARCH, 1937. DEAR MR. JABBAR, I HAKE RECEIVED ALL YOUR LETTERS. YOU ARE NOT PERHAPS AWARE THAT I HAVE BEEN ELECTED AS A MEMBER TO THE BENGAL LAGISLA- TIVE ASSEMBLY. / HAVE NO BREATHING TIME. I SHALL BE AY/AY FROM NOAKHAL I FROM APRIL 1, FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS. NONE OF YOUR RELA TIVES TAKE ANY INTEREST IN YOUR CASE. YOU HAVE GOT ENOUGH TIME BUT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO UTILISE IT TO YOUR BENEFIT. I HAVE ALL ALONG ADVISED YOU TO COMPROMISE THE CASE. EVEN IF YOU SUCCEED IN THE CASE PENDING NOW ULTIMATELY YOU WILL HAVE TO SUFFER. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PENDING OF THIS MISC. CASE, YOU OUGHT TO MANAGE YOUR AFFAIRS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. THEY WANT THE PRINCIPAL MONEY AND THE COSTS. I UNDERSTAND YOU AGREED TO PAY RS.4,300/- IN ALL TO SATISFY BOTH THE BONDS. IN MY OPINION IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT LIKE THIS. OTHER WISE, YOU WILL SUFFER. THE BRITISH POLITICAL AGENT HAS RETURNED THE COMMISSION AS THE QUESTIONS WERE FRAMED IN ENGLISH, ON THE GROUND THAT THE COURT LANGUAGE THERE IS ARABIC. SO WE SHALL HAVE TO FRAME THE QUESTIONS IN ARABIC AND IF THE MATTER IS TAKEN UP BY THE TRANSLA TOR OF THE HIGH COURT IT WILL COST YOU MUCH. THEREFORE, ON THE 22ND I GAVE THE COURT AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE SHALL TRANSLATE THE QUESTIONS THROUGH THE HELP OF A ENGLISH-KNOWING MOULVI, AT A LESS COST, THE CASE HAS BEEN ADJOURNED IN THE 5TH APRIL. AFTER THE QUESTIONS ARE SUBMITTED IN ARABIC, THEY WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE POLITICAL AGENT FOR YOUR DEPOSITION. YOU SEE THE TROUBLE AND THE HEAVY EXPENSES; BUT THE ULTIMATE RESULTS ARE NOTHING. IT IS IM POSSIBLE TO GET AN ORDER OF RELEASE OF ATTACHMENT OF YOUR BANK DEPOSIT BEFORE THE EX-PARTE DECREE IS SET ASIDE. YOUR BROTHER HAS BEEN WRONGLY ADVISED BY SOMEBODY AT CALCUTTA, COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF LEGAL MATTERS, THE MONEY SENT BY YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN SPENT, IN MEETING THE EXPENSES OF THE COMMISSION, EFFIDAVITS, PETITIONS AND TELEGRAM, MY ADVICE IS TO COMPROMISE THE CASE AT ONCE. I MAY TELL YOU NOBODY WILL TAKE ANY INTEREST FOR YOUR CASE DURING MY ABSENCE. NO MORE TO-DAY. PLEASE DO WHAT YOU THINK BEST. YOURS SINCERELY, SGD.

On the verj date on which I placed the order before the plaintiff, to deliver the goods to Saleh Al Majid ; 1 sent a cheque to the latter for Re.290/-. I am not definite about the number of the cheque because I made a mistake in issuing the cheques that day and issued two cheques for Re.290/- in favour of Saleh Al Majid one of which I cancelled and the other X sent to him. The numbers of these two cheques are'nastern- Bank Limited, Bombay^No. E422182 and No. L4h2183 respectively dated 19.4.33. X cannot say definitely which of these two cheques I actually sent to Saleh a! Majid but I am certain that I sent one of these to him. t. ( Letters put in court as nxhibits Noe. ^1, a2 and A3 shown to witness). Exhibits Nos. Al, a 2 and a 3 were written by Saleh Al Majid to me ( Yusuf Mahmud Husain). The letters-a- r 1 letters were cigned by Saleh ^-1 Majid. r lhe body of all those letters was written by Saleh Al Majid who also signed them. In Exhibit Ko. Al Saleh Al Majid himself admits that he received my cheque and paid tX to plaintiffs the cum of Hs.285/8/-. 5.

Majid. 7. The cheque was sent by me to second defendant Saleh ai Majid on 19.4.33. I do not know when it was cashed by him. It was a crossed cheque on Eastern Bank, Bombay. It was a cneque and not a draft. 8. I do not know. 9. I had sent the cheque to second defendant in pxyMKt payment of the accounts of the goods I had ordered plaintiffs to deliver to second defendant. 10.

Dated, 6th September 1938Printed letter No.877/12/1-IV. dated the 1oth May 1938 from the Secretary to the Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buehire. The Resiliency have forwarded to us a £/-&lt;yv letter of Requost^issued by the Court of Small CauseS, BomDa.y, for the examination of Yusuf Mahmood Husain, a Bahrain subject. S.76 Civil Procedure Code amthorises any court to issue a. Commission to another court situate in another province for the examination of a witness and S.77 authorises issue of a letter of request in lieu thereof. S.35-(l), B.O.C. treats Bahrain 'as if it were a district in the Presidency of Bombay'. Hence the legali ty of the issue of a commission or a letter of request in lieu thereof from any Court in British India for execution thereof in Bahrain. The Government of India, have also made it clear ( o.36) that 'Letters of Requeot issued by Inaian Courts can be executed at Ba.hr a in upoy ft persons who are British subjects. This^implies that Letters of Request cannot be executed upon non-British sifDjects whicxi term include foreigners as well as Bahrain subjects. On the contrary ,3.75 Civil Procedure Code- clear ly provides for iftsue of commission by a court—and a letter of request is only a substitute thereof - , inter alia, 'to examine any person' and Order 26, rule 4-(a) ibid for the examination of ' any person resident beyond the local limits of its jurisdiction'. And as the Civil Procedure Code applies without any exception or limitations to Bahrain (vide schedule to B.O.C.) the Letter of Request can be executed in Bahrain even upon non-British subjects inspite of the apparently contra dictory ruling of the Government of India; Q± course, under S.II-(5) B.O.C. 4he Court '’(of the Political ) Agent) 'may construe any enactments in force in Bahrain under the provisions of Article 11 (under which law of British India and United Kingdom are applicable toBahrain), 'with cucn alterations not affecting the substance, as may be necessary or proper to adotpt the same to the matter before the Court'. Also according to S.13 B.O.C. ; inter alia. ' any laws in force in India .... or procedure may be construed or used with such alteration and adaptations not affecting the substance as may be necessary havig regard to the local circumstances'. But the execution of a Letter of Request does not appear to be a case in which the application of Sections ll-(5) and 13 would be necessary and the Letter of Request sent by the Small CauseS Court, Bombay, may be executed. The letter of the Government of India on page 36 referred to above does not definitely exclude non-British subjects from those upon whom Letter of Request can be executed as it only says that ouch letters can be executed upon 'British subjects' and does not say upon'British subjects aloneV 2. With regard to the procedure to be adopted by us in execution of the Letter of Request, as the defendant witness is a Bahrain subject and his examina- tion will be used in evidence in a civil suitfhis exami nation may be recorded jointly by the Indian Assistant and a representative of the Bahrain Government name 3.y Indian Assistants collogue in the Junior Joint Court Shaikh -ali bin Muhammad a 1 Khalifah. Section 45-1-(a) B.O.C./of course / authorises P.A. to hear and determine in his District Court a suit filed by (i) a Bahrain subject against a non-Bahrain subject or (ii) by a non-Bahrain subj ect against a Bahrain subject. Still the concurrence of the Shaikh of Bahrain has to be obtained for it and, apart from that, in actual practice the cases failing under (ii) i.e .^non-Bahrainis versus Bahrainis are not heard or determined in the District Court but in the Joint Court under sub-section (l)-(b) to section 45^ which is an alternative to sub-section-3- suD-scction (l)~(a) of section 45. May therefore P.A. he pleasedt o appoint I.A. ana his colleague in the Junior Joint Court as commissioners under section 76-(2) and Order £6-(6) Civil Procedure Code wnich enjoin^ upon tne Court to which a commission is sent to examine the person or 'cause him to be examined persuant thereto'. Moreover the wrio of commission (or the Letter of Request) is addressed to P.A. 'or such other officer as he may appoint' - a circumstance which clearly shows thae a commission may be appointed by a court to which a Letter o i Re quest is sent for ex c- cu t i o n. 3. In regard to the question of fee chargeable on commission about which the Letter of Request wants us to imorm tne Small.Causes Court before the commission is executed, I am afraid I have not been able to find any specific provi on in the Indian Court Pees Act in suite of all possible efforts. But last year we had received a similar letter of Request (page 21; also notes P. ^) from the Court of Sub-Judge, Noakhaii, Bengal, with a commission fee of Rs.25/-; and we may charge the same fee now. Of course.in matters of details re^ardin^ Court Fees etc. we follow the Bombay practice( vide section ll-(l) B.O.C.). But it is minor point and there woulu be no serious violation of procedure if we adopted the Bengal practice as a standaru commission te e, specially wnen wc* have once ao.. oruc-ti to it. n 4.

Walter Hillman before me, at Bahrain 5'gv^ day of JAA.A&gt;u^ouj . 1946. Island, Persian Gulf, this r,wer»s work as a machinist since he arrived on the «xd was of consistently poor caliber* he proved himself .At irely lacking in intrest in doing his share to complete the high priority war project that was under construction at this time . lie was on many occasions absent from his work during shift hours without premission from his foreman Mr. vVebb or from the first aid man Mr. Ha,imer. On his absences from hisown work he would go to other parts of the project talking to groups of other men and interfering with their work and when he was away from his own work he left his crew of native labors unattended and without supervision whereby their work was hampered and rendered less effective than if Powers had remained on the job and directed them. Powers was a chronic complainer constantly complaining about working conditions* wanting to change his work to marine work etc. which we had none of. 2. On the afternoon of Mar. 13 I missed Powers from the job he was working on but saw a group of natives there unattended. I went on through the plant and in about the course of an hour I happen to return by the same route and again I noticed Powers noi the re with that 1 ask the natives where he was and they told me he had been gone for some time in fact that he hadn’t returned from lunch. I then went to the machinist foreman Webb and ask where Powers was Webb’s ans. was that he was suppose to be there on the job and that if he was gone from there he had not gotten premission from him. With this I checked further with Ray Keltner the Gen. Machinist foreman to be sure he hadn’t move him to another job, too he^told me Powers was suppose to be there. From here I went back to see if Powers had returned but he still was not there and the natives again said he had not returned. With this I went to the first aid station in the refinery only a short distance from where Powers should have been working to see if he had reported to the attendant for aid. Mr. Hammer who was in charge said he had not been in during the afternoon., this time it was three P.M. and Keltner came to me « Powers was back on the job so Keltner &amp; I went over to where he was and ask him where he had been and he told us he had been to the Awali hospital. when we ask him who he had gotten permission from he said he hadn’t gotten it from any one but simply went in on his own accord. Without further discussion I went to the Awali hospital to investigate the hospital’s records for that day &amp; found that Powers had not reported to the hosp. on the afternoon of Nov.13-44 between noon and about 4-30 p.ra. when I made this investigation. 3* After finding Powers left the job without premission from any one I advised Hay Keltner the G n. Machinist foreman to discharge Powers for (1) for his general poor quality of work manship (2) for his continued course of conduct of being absent from his job during working hours without uremission and in violation of Co. rules &amp; regulations which were in effect months prior to this and for failure to conform with the many reprimands given by myself &amp; his foreman. (3) For the lack of interest Mr. Powers took in doing his job for his grumbling and complaining and his failure to do his share to contribute to the preformance of the work as he has shown by his continual absence from the job without premission. (4) For Powers violation of specific Co. regulations conceding clearing with his foreman or the first aid before leaving the jobsite during working hours. (5) For the specific incident on Nov. 13th - 1944 when iir. Powers was away from his duties from 12-30 to 3-00 P.;4. without proper preraission or authority &amp; a direct violation of Co. rules &lt;&amp; regulations and leaving his native crew unattended whereby they were not doing their job and could wander to operating parts of the refinery. (6) The entire picture presented by the foregoing reasons culminating in the specific instance of Nov. 13 rendered it necessary in ray opinion to request Powers discharge from theC4 '$) - 3 - order to maintain the morale on the high priority If Powers were promitted to continue with this course * disobedience &amp; misconduct the morale of the job would have suffered in my opinion, it would have more difficult to maintain discipline over other men in view of Powers actions* At the execution of the Commission for the examination of J* Walter Hillman in the cause pending between John R* Power, Plaintiff, v* Bechtel-McCone Corporation and Compania Constructora Bechtel—McCone, S*A*, et al*, Defendants, this paper was produced and sworn to by J.
