The face is conventional with large inset eyes apparently intended to be inlaid. The head wears a large wig of the type found on cartonnages and is surmounted by a crown or capital. Probably a study for a statue of a goddess as Hathor. On the forehead and neck are geometric inscriptions for designs which cannot be identified. They are almost certainly modern forgeries for they appear meaningless, they are out of position and also they are much lighter in color than the surrounding stone. The piece itself was apparently cast and is certainly genuine. \r\nCondition: Nose chipped, left eye chipped crown broken.", "medium": "Plaster", "dimensions": "6 3/4 \u00d7 4 5/16 in.
