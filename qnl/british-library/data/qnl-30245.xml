Your despatch No.43. ^ \i Ellison has approached Sultan and reports as follows. Begins. I have raised with the Sultan the question of possible sale of Gwadur. He replied that he did not feel able to take such a far reaching and irrevocable decision which would alienate ancestral property and might antagonise public opinion. I do not think that a moderate increase in the amount of the offer would affect his decision. He did not specifically ask advice though I told him that H.M.G. viewed the proposal favou rably. On the other hand I am fairly sure that he could be induced to agree to a lease. He mentioned this proposal him self and seemed to feel that as long as Muscat sovereignty remained intact an arrangement might be possible . In the course of conversation the Sultan emphasized that he considered the situation in Gwadur similar to that in Goa and Pondicherry. Ends. 2. I suggest that the Pakistan Government should be informed that the Sultan is not willing to sell Gwadur but that he might be persuaded to lease it and that they should be asked whether they wish us to negotiate with him on this basis.Telegram , M , Pad Fi’om Political, Rfuscat To Prodrome, Bahrain No.106* Dated the I6th June, 1949* 5 'v' Your telegram No.109• I am seeing Sultan today and shall aslr his view on Gwadur.

If Sultan asks for advice reply as In penultimate sentence of paragraph 7 of my despatch 12 extract of which accompanied my letter (rout). Please telegraph when you expect to approach Sultan as I should like to inform Woods-Ballard of position. Hay MB.• — — TOP SECRET 125/16/491} The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain* ICth June, 1949. I forward herewith extracts of certain correspondence about Gwadur, some of which you saw when you visited Bahrain. I have enquired telegraphically from the Foreign Office what reply we are to give to the Sultan if he asks for our advice. On receipt of their reply, I will telegraph instructions. If the extracts enclosed do not in your opinion furnish you with sufficient material for taking action please let me know. R.Eldon Ellison, Esq., The Political Agent, Muscat.COPY 4. The boundaries of Gwadur with Mekran have remained undefined all this time with the result that the whole position has become unsat isfactory and not a little complicated* The original Guza Jagir was limited to the area then covered by the port only. Since then, however, there has been considerable encroachment over the adjoining Mekran territory. This has frequently led to local disturbances and friction which are likely to increase as time goes on.'1 COPY 2 # i agree that you should put the Pakistan request to the Sultan. Outright sale, however, and not lease, which might involve complications, should be proposed. If you see no objection, I suggest that you should mention the sum offered by Pakistan. There seems little point in withholding this inform ation to a later stage of the negotiations unless you think the offer is so low that the Sultan will be offended. You will have seen from the minutes of the meeting of the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan with Sir William Strang forwarded by bag that the former was acquainted with our view that the financial consideration offered by Pakistan is inade' quate. His remark that the amount of consideration to be offered is a matter for negotiation seems to show that Pakistan may be prepared to increase their offer.COPY 7. Although in my opinion it is unlikely that the uecple of Gwadur will welcome the proposed retro cession, and although the prosperity of the place may well decline as a result of it, I agree that there is much to be said for it especially from the ideological point of view, and I recommend therefore that I be authorised to inform the Sultan of the Pakistan Government's approach in geneial^ terms and to enquire whether he would be willing to sell or lease Gwadur to H.M.G* for subsequent transfer to Pakistan and if so, on what terms. If he asks whether H.M.G. advise him to sell the place I would reply that on the whole they think he might be wise to do so, as the naturally part of Mekran and he might find himsell in difficulties later if an agitation is started against Arab rule over it. If, on the other hand, as may now be the case, he raises strong objections to handing over the place for eventual transfer to Pakistan, I will report for further instructions.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000030_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/273</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000030</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/273</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/78 II Sale of Gwadur to His Majesty's Government'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-26T22:16:43</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (10 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 12; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file concerns the question of whether the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] would be willing to sell or lease the territory of Gwadur [Gwadar] to the Government of Pakistan, with the British Government acting as an intermediary.
