This draft report is generally satisfactory in that it recommends the retention of the principle of special land zones and also the maintenance of iiaritime zones in the Red 3 ea and the Gulf of Aden. The dispute as regards the Persian Gulf special zone is to be referred to the Plenary Committee. There is, of course, some possibility that we ray be able to make a special arrangement with the Persians in respect of this area and we are at the moment awaiting a reply to our latest note to them on the subject. j ( y&lt;33 1933 * « &lt; a 3b 3 ! v;&gt; 3 :r. t * •&gt;?-'3 4X45/E11/M) { ■2/40/46) strict trom i)laantt&amp;fflt)nt C^ntcr^nco jooument Oonf« 13/CCT/SCC16.

MM*01548/33 th June, 1933. 1^ dear Rendel. Thank you for your letter K• 3012/211/34 of th e 10th June, about Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf. We feel that OarT's statement in the last sentence of hie letter ('the old illusion that the Persians will allow us to do something to their ships which we won’t let them do to ours') does scant justice to the case he is asked to present. f I3ie essence of the business is that we are prepared to abandon our historic policy in ferour of of a Persian proposal that in the Gulf their Navy shall shepherd their own sheep, and the British Navy shall be a sort of universal shepherd, looking after all the rest. Since it would easily be possible for any of our sheep to escape (i.e. by flying the I ersian flag on sighting a British warship), it is clear that if we are to discharge our duty as universal G.W.Rendel Sag.., C.M.G., FORJSIGN 0FRIGS.- 2 - shepherd we must he able to stop any such untoward happening* For thlc purpose it is necessary that the lersian Government should recognise that where wo have reason for believing that their flag is being used as a ruse by one of our sheep* we shall not fold our hands in resignation* It is necessary to get their concurrence in this arrangement only because sometimes a mistake may be made and a genuine Persian lamb may be called upon to prove her paternity; but apart from this possibility it is not correct to say that we wish to 'do something to their ships which we won’t let them do to ours'** As for the question of reciprocity, it is impossible to deal fully with this here, but we are inclined to think that the reply should be (a) dropping the Gulf as a special zone is a considerable concession Jq * and Persia for her part ought therefore to concede something in return* (t) the right to verify the flags of otner saioa is not essential to her as U is to us, hecause she is only responsible .or her ovn ships* particulars of which are Known to h r.3 1 ^ In f&amp;ct, they can all be arrested if necessary in Persian ports. Whereas we are responsible for vessels which may be registered in aiy part of the globe. (c) v.e might also tell her frankly that pressing this matter will only ruin the whole project and make it necessary to fall back upon the special sone. Ve anticipate that it will be difficult to secure the concurrence of the Powers in the multi~ lateral protocol, even i supervisioh by British ships alone is provided for; but if in addition provision is made for the added complication of 'verifieatim of the Hug’ 1 by Persia, it becomes practically impossible. Can we not also add that we know that certain countries (we need not particularise India and Arabia) would never accept such an arrangement? (d) If the lersians refuse to make concessions they must be held responsible for preventing proper control of the anas traffic. Possibly it might be as well to explain the matter more fully to Carr on these lines. I am sanding copies of this letter to Laithwaite, Pe*$ae# Toovey, James and fclarker. Yours sincerely* A, S ' r 1la Charge (^Affaires consequent on the recent discussions in tne t.inisteriai Middle ^ust Conmittee and in the Cabinet on the subject of tne Anns Traffic Convention. We are in a very difficult position in this matter. Cn the one hand, as Mr. Walton points out in his minute on P.Z.316E/ 33, the admiralty are able to produce arguments of real cogency in favour of our retaining tne ri^ht to verify the flag of vessels which may be falsely flying the Persian flag. On the otner hand, as Mr. Carr points out in his letter to Mr. Aendel of 7th June, now attached, the prospects of the Persians agreeing to anything which appears ’’to rest on the old illusion that the Persians will allow us to do something to their ships which we won’t let them do to ours” is exceedingly poor, and the first reaction of the Persian delegate at Geneva goes to suggest tnat there is little chance of our persuading them to agree to a one-sided right oi verification, fle $ can but await further developments.O.B.B. .

Since then the Admiralty have, with great force and clearness, pointed oat the desirability of retaining the right to verify the flag of vessels which may be falsely flying the Persian flag,and suggested that in the proposed draft convention with Persia this right should be specifically provided for. There is no objection to this from the 1.0. point of view, so long as no reciprocal right to verify the flag of Arab or Indian vessels has to be granted to Persian warships. The matter was discussed in the Ministerial Middle East Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. on 25th May, and in the Cabinet on 26th May. Extract from the Cabinet conclusions (which are in accordance with the views of the Admiralty and 1.0.) is attached. The F.O. have now forwarded a fresh draft Note to the Persian C harge d f Affaires, revised in accordance with the Cabinet conclusions. We can concur in the new draft. It^quite correctly 7 omits all reference to reciprocity. Perhaps the Persians will accept the proposal without raising the question of reciprocity, though we shall noo be surprised if this thorny subject is raised by them in the course of the further negotiations. 3 i, /&lt; vD1 (' \'W Draft Paper, ''’v. ’ 34- P.z. 3162/33.

In the opinion of the Persian Government, give His Majesty®s Governiwnt all the rights which they could legitimately desire, would fully provide for the adequate control of the illicit traffic in arms in the two Gulfs and the adjacent areas, and would offer a full and sufficient guarantee against its recrudescence® . 3&lt;&gt; On my pointing out to Monsieur S^pahbodi in reply that it would be impossible to confer, by means of a purely bilateral convention of this type, rights on one of the contracting parties ov&lt;?r vesselsTeasels flying the flag of a third party^ Monsieur Sepahho&amp;i explained that the Persian Government would see no objection to other Powers acceding to the proposed bilateral convention* or otherwise signifying their acceptance of its provisions in so far as they and their vessels might be concerned* This might for instance be done by means of a separate multilateral protocol to be concluded at the same time as the proposed bilateral convention* 4a Monsieur Sepahbodi suggested as on alternative to the above suggestion that onlj the Arab side of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman should be included in the special maritime zone* and that the waters on the Persian side of the two Gulfs should be left free e I am informed however* that this proposal would be lively to meet with serious difficulties in practice* 5 C The Persian Government 7 s suggestion for the conclusion of a bilateral agreement on the lines of their draft of November 10th* and for the conclusion of a multilateral agreement providing for the necessary concurrence therein of the other powers concerned has been examined by the competent authorities of fiis Majesty 7 s Government. As the Persian Government are aware* it has long been the constant endeavour of Hie Majesty’s Government to secure by every means in their power the strictest possible control over the illicit traffic in arms® Any relaxation4o relaxation in the efforts hitherto made to check and control this dangerous and pernicious traffic 9 or any public abandonment by His Majesty*s Government of any of the rights hitherto exercised by them with a view to checking it. would in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, be likely to lead to a grave danger of its recrudescence * aonsequinces which might well prove equally serious to all concerned* For ra&amp;ny years the principle of the special zones has been regarded by His Majesty’s Government as on© of the most effective means for combatting this traffic, and it is clear that there are grave objections to weakening this principle by the removal from the special zone of a large area which has admittedly in the past been an active centre of the traffic® Before therefore f His Majesty’s Government could agree to the exclusion of the two gulfs from the proposed special maritime zone 6 it would be necessary for them to be satisfied that the new arrangements now proposed would be no less effective for preventing any revival of the illicit traffic in arms than those hitherto in contemplation* 6 0 On the other hand. Hie Majesty's Government fully appreciate the desire of the Persian Government to secure immunity from the risk of unnecessary detention by foreign i, warships for vessels legitimately flying the Persian42. where legitimate grounds for suspicion existed, ha^e the right to verify that the vessel was in fact entitled to fly the Persian flag* This^ would, however, give His Majesty S s ships no right to detain or divert any vessel found on examination to he entitled to f&amp;y the Persian flag, and would he strictly limited to verification of the vessel’s right to fly the Persian flag in cases where definite grounds existed for suspecting that it was flying the Persian flag without the approval of the Persian authorities., 8* provided that a provision on these lines can he incorporated in the proposed bilateral agreement, that the agreement itself, with such minor modifications as may be necessary, can be concluded without delay, and that the necessary international sanction for the relevant provisions of the agreement can he simultaneously obtained from the other parties concerned, so that both the proposed hilaterau agreement and the multilateral protocol can he concluded in anticipation of, or simultaneously with, the main convention, HiB Majesty s Government will, in order to meet, the views 01 the Persian Government in the friendliest spirit, be prepared to modify their attitude in the sense which the Persian Government desire. In these circumstances I have the honour to request you to inform Monsieur Sepahbodi that, if, as I trust, the Persian Government are willing to accept43 aceept the foregoing conditions* Hie Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will ha prepared to instruct their representative on the competent committee of the Disarmament Con ference, as soon as these arrangements have been agreed upon, to consent to the omission of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman from the special maritime zone to be provided for in the proposed general convention* 9o It is clear, however, that both the proposed bilateral agreement and the multilateral convention or protocol containing the necessary international sanction for it* will need careful negotiation. In view of the importance of keeping this question wholly within the framework of the Disarmament conference. His Majesty Government propose that this negotiation shall be carried on at Geneva. If the Persian Government agree to this course, the necessary instructions will he sent to the Onited Kingdom representative on the Disartaameat Conference forthwith, and as soon as the necessity agreement has been reached with the Persian representative and with the representatives of the other Powers concerned, the United Kingdom representative will inform the Conference officially of the modification of the ai.oii.ude of His Majeaty'o Government on the question of the inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman within the proposed special maritime zone.44 ^^° from Cabinet Conclusions 19 ^ 5 . PERSIA AND I THE ARMS TRAFFIC CC EVENT ION. ' l * le Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Persia and the Arms Traffic (Previous Reference: Cabinet 36(33), Conclusion 6). Convention: A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.136(33) pointing out that a Sub-Committee of the Disarmament Conference had for some time been considering the preparation of an International Convention for the suppression of illicit traffic in arms, and proposed, inter alia , a special maritime zone in which the warships of the contracting parties should have the right to visit andjcontrol certain classes of vessels. This maritime zone included the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, to which strong objection was raised by the Persian Government, who threatened to v/ithdraw from the Conference unless an early solution could be found. The Secretary of State asked for a decision as to which of the two following courses of action should be pursued:- (i) His Majesty’s Government could ignore the Persian representations and continue to press for a Convention closely reproducing the provisions of that of 1925, and, in particular, includin^the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the Special Maritime Zone; or/45 or (ii) An attempt could be made to meet the Persian wishes by excluding the two Gulfs from the Maritime Zone provided for in the Convention, and)by dealing with them in the two separate instruments proposed in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum. The Secretary of State trusted that his colleagues would agree to the adoption of course (ii). A Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (C.P.143(33)) together with a later Note attached thereto opposing the adoption of course (ii) above and pressing for a proposal to Persia on the lines of the compromise mentioned in paragraph 9 of C.P.136(33). A Report by the Standing Ministerial Sub committee for Questions concerning the Middle East (C.P.140(33)) furnished in accordance with the request of the Cabinet at the meeting mentioned in themaxgin and submitting the following conclusions: (1) That unless the right of verifying the flag of suspicious vessels is retained it will be impossible in practice to control the traffic in arms in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. If this right is to be lost in any case courses (i) and (ii) as stated would be equally objectionable: 2 (2) That there can be no question of extending reciprocally to Persian ships(3) ACo the right to verify the flag of British Indian pnd Arab vessels: That the most advantageous course of action to His Majesty’s Government would he alternative (ii), as modified hy paragraph 9 of C.P.136(33), i.e., to secure the right of verification of flag in the case of the Persian flag only; and that an effort should he made to persuade the Persian Government to agree to this course: (4) That if our existing powers of control in the Persian Gulf are to he lost in any case, there would he certain advantages in obtaining a guarantee from the Persians that they would not claim any rights of control over vessels other than those flying the Persian flag. Af tei;considerahle discussion the Cabinet agreed (a) That the instructions to the British representative in any negotiations with the Persian Government on this subject should he in accordance with (l), (2) and (3) above, and that no reference should he made in those instructions to the alternative course (4): (h) That if it was found impossible to obtain th* acceptance of the proposals in (3) the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should again consult the Cabinet who would consider whether it would be desirable to fall back on (4).It is imnorbant from the I*0. ^lint of view that Persia should not acquire the ri$it to search Arab vessels in the Gulf, as she would be able to do if the Gulf li a special zone, and if she nevertheless acceded to the Convention* There is, howovr^r, no nak that Persia would accede to the Convention if the Persian Gulf is made a special zone. The proposal made by the P*0*. however # also meets this 1#0# ^ * rooutf? m th t Persia ^culd explicitly ^ave up any right to search /^rab vessels. Ve expreeaed general agre^ont with the J* *0 * proposal in oar official letter of IGth Pay. The ? # G # proposal # however* as wor eu, because it refers to vessels flying the Persian flag* would deprive ufc of the rijit of venfyin ; the flag. In view of the importance of this right, the compromise proposal now made by the admiralty deserves careful consideration, JU&gt;. that the bilateral convention with Persia nrooosed by the ?.0. should be adopted, subject to a nrovision enabling, British warshios to the Persian flag in cases where there is reason to suspectthat the vessel flying it is not Persian. If, however, I'ersia raised the coertion of reciprocity, we rhoald be unable to give Persia the reciprocal right to verify the ijau flat's, and it is very doubtful how far we could allow the right to verify the British flog (e, in the case of Incian vessel?) • 2J~. r.

A© regards Tart 1 of Section 6 In Annex XI» the sens© I think.

The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman would not be included in the special maritime zone provided for in the body of the Convention to be negotiated at Geneva but A would be dealt with by the following separate instruments :— ’ 4. A bilateral Anglo-Persian Convention would be concluded, by which Persia would assume full responsibility for supervising all shipping flyino- the Persian flag on the high seas of the two gulfs, but would undertake not to claim any right to control any shipping not flying her flag in this area. This Convention would be accompanied by a multilateral protocol (to which Persia would not however, be a party), by which the contracting parties, in so far as each was concerned, would recognise either the exclusive right of His Majesty’s Govern ment, or, alternatively, the common right of all the contracting parties to the protocol, to visit and control shipping under 500 tons not flying the Persian flao' These two instruments would be negotiated, and would enter into force simultaneously with the main convention, and the exclusion of the two Gulfs from the Special Maritime Zone provided for in the latter would be conditional on these two instruments being accepted. 5. A decision is now required as to which of the two following alternative courses of action should be pursued (a) His Majesty s Government could ignore the Persian representations and continue to press for a convention closely reproducing the provisions of that of 1925, and, in particular, including the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman m the Special Maritime Zone; or *5) An attempt could be made to meet the Persian wishes by excluding the two Gulfs from the Maritime Zone provided for in the Convention, and by dealing with them m the two separate instruments proposed in paragraph 4 above. r 1 lead ^to thp 1 id t0 C0U J Se (a \ is while it would almost certainly about a sitnatinn 0 - ^■ om the Disarmament (conference and bring would not n nraotF Considerable Anglo-Persian friction in the Gulf area, it be a LitVto Hp ^ ° f th ? n S hts we desire * As Persia would not aW n^htLver shin ^ 0uld n0t ac A uire under that Convention any shadowv rip-htF WP , 6 F eiSlan and P e f s ia w T ould certainly challenge rights have no sound Ipc/Th 1 P r ^ ent be exer cising, more especiallv as those or°control^ sMds S fl\dn p- tf^ P* 1818 ^ should we acquire no rights to visit have not yet^ban^doifpd^thr 61,81 ^^ lfc is P^bable that the Persians, who Persian orrecopri i^d 1 ^ aim t0 and certain otb er islands in the themselves claim rights oL^th^shiDm^ 1 ? 11 ^^^ the Arab rillerS ’ might incidents in respect of which we shoufd hp 0i the f territ&lt; ? rie .s, and provoke redress.

The twoConventions proposed in paragraph 4 above will give us precisely the same rights as we should have acquired under a Convention, to which Persia was not a party, based on that of 1925. In neither case is there any hope of those rights being extended to apply to shipping flying the Persian flag. 9. Objections have been raised to the adoption of course (b) on the ground that, even if in practice the results as regards the immunity of Persian shipping will be much the same, the formal exclusion of the Persian‘Gulf and the Gulf of Oman from the special maritime zone will weaken the value of that principle, and will be regarded locally as implying a weakening of the authority of His Majesty’s Government. In particular, it has been suggested that it is important to secure by some means or other the power for His Majesty’s ships to verify the right of ships flying the Persian flag to flv that flag. and‘ objections have been raised to the idea of ships being exempt from control merely by flying a flag to which they may, in fact, possess no right. It has therefore been suggested that, if course (b) is to be adopted, this should only be done conditionally on the insertion of a provision in the proposed bilateral Anglo-Persian Convention on the following lines : “ Both parties to agree to co-operate in checking the use of the ; Persian flag by unauthorised persons. For this purpose Persia will agree that His Majesty’s ships should have the right, in suspicious cases, to verify that the vessel is authorised to fly the Persian flag; this right, however, to include no power of detention or diversion of the Persian vessels.” 10. The difficulty about this proposal is that it would be impossible to secure the agreement of the Persian Government to any such provision. The Persian representative made it clear on the 24th April that Persia’s main reason for objecting to the inclusion of the Gulfs in the special maritime zone was to secure immunity for shipping flying the Persian flag from visits by foreign warships. Even if this basic difficulty could be overcome, the Persian Government would certainly insist on the right to verify the flag being reciprocal, and on Persian warships therefore acquiring a similar power to verify the right of British ships to fly the British flag. If this could be limited to United Kingdom ships, the difficulty might perhaps not be insuperable, since there are extremely few United Kingdom ships of under 500 tons in the two Gulfs. But it would, in practice, be impossible to prevent the right thus granted to the Persian Government from extending to British Indian and British-protected ships, particularly as we know that the Persians are most anxious to acquire rights over local Arab vessels, if only in connexion with the suppression of smuggling. If. then, Persia were to acquire any rights over vessels other than those flying the Persian flag, the Foreign Office consider that it is certain that they would claim the right to verify the flags of local Arab shipping and thus acquire the power to interfere with such shipping with results which would be fatal to our prestige on the Arab coast of the Gulf and in India. 11. It will be seen from the foregoing that, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, there is no prospect whatever of our acquiring the right to inspect vessels flying the Persian flag, either for the purpose of verifying the flag or for any other system of control, whether we adopted course (a) or the compromise suggested in paragraph 9 above; and that, this being so, there can be no doubt that course (b), which should enable us, with Persian consent, to maintain some degree of maritime control in the Persian Gulf, and to secure the adoption of the complete special regime in the remainder of the maritime zone and in the land zones, presents very considerable advantages. The advantages of course (a), indeed, seem to be purely illusory, while its drawbacks may well prove most serious; and I therefore trust that my colleagues will agree to the adoption of course (b), which will, in practice, secure precisely the same results, and to my addressing the Persian Charge d'Affaires accordingly on the lines of the note, a draft of which is attached as Annex. b 2 [8629]Draft Note to Fathollah Khan Noury-Esfandiary, Persian Charge d'Affaires, London. Sir, _ Foreign Office, May ,1933. IN the course of his conversation with me on the 24th April, Anoushirvan Khan Sepahbodi explained to me the views of the Persian Government on the question of the proposed inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the special maritime zone to be set up under the Convention on the Traffic in Arms which is at present under consideration by a sub-committee of the Disarma ment Conference. M. Sepahbodi expressed the earnest hope of the Persian Government that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom would agree to the two Gulfs not being included in the proposed special maritime zone, and, on my drawing his attention to the difficulties which the exclusion of this area from the zone might put in the way of the effective control in the traffic in arms, put forward, under instructions from his Government, certain alternative suggestions for meeting the situation. 2. M. Sepahbodi’s principal suggestion was that His Majesty’s Government should agree to conclude with the Persian Government a bilateral convention on the lines of the draft communicated to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran by the Persian Government on the 10th November, 1932.’ He explained that it was specifically provided in that draft (i.e., by article 2) that on the high seas of the two Gulfs the supervision and control of all vessels flying the Persian flag, which might be suspected of participation in the illicit traffic in arms, should be entrusted to the naval authorities of Persia, while the supervision and control on the high seas of the two Gulfs of all vessels suspected of the illicit traffic in arms, other than those flying the Persian flag, would be entrusted to the British naval authorities. Such a provision would, in the opinion of the Persian Government, give His Majesty s Government all the rights which they could legitimately desire, v. ou c lull} provide for the adequate control of the illicit traffic in arms in the wo us and the adjacent areas, and would offer a full and sufficient guarantee against its recrudescence. tn P omtin g out to ^epahbodi, in reply, that it would be impossible 7 means of a purely bilateral convention of this type, rights on one of exDlaffi^W g t P vf 1 p es ° ver n essels flying the flag of a third party, M.

For many veais the principle of the special zones has been regarded by His Maiestv’s overnment as one of the most effective means for combating this traffic, and it is clear that there are the gravest objections to weakening this principle by the removal from the special zone of a large area which has admittedly in the past been an active centre of the traffic. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Govern ment are anxious to co-operate with, and to meet the views of, the Persian Government in this matter in the friendliest spirit in so far as they can do so consistently with their policy of maintaining the strictest possible effective control over the illicit traffic in arms. Provided therefore that the alternative arrangements now suggested can be shown to be likely to prove no less effective for this purpose than those hitherto contemplated, and that the new agreements proposed can be concluded in anticipation of, or simultaneously with, the mam convention, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to modify their attitude in the sense desired by the Persian Government. 6. In these circumstances, I have the honour to request you to inform M. Sepahbodi that, on the clear understanding that a bilateral agreement on the lines ^ suggested by the Persian Government, with certain necessary minor modifications, is concluded without delay, and that the necessary international sanction for the relevant provisions of this agreement can be simultaneously obtained from the other parties concerned, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will be prepared to instruct their representative on the competent committee of the Disarmament Conference, as soon as these agreements have been concluded, to consent to the omission of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman from the special maritime zone laid down in the proposed convention. 7. It is clear, however, that both the proposed bilateral agreement and the multilateral convention or protocol containing the necessary international sanction for it, will need careful negotiation. In view of the importance of keeping this question wholly within the framework of the Disarmament Conference, His Majesty’s Government propose that this negotiation should be carried on at Geneva. If the Persian Government agree to this course, the necessary instruc tions will be sent to the United Kingdom representative on the Disarmament Conference forthwith, and as soon as the necessary agreement has been reached with the Persian representative and with the representatives of the other Powers concerned, the United Kingdom representative will inform the Conference officially of the modification of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government on the question of the inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman within the proposed special maritime zone. that uded - two id be the the g for most ment. mr of ictest ifforts r any herto ‘ !

They are at reeert apparently based upon the 'customary right' which British warships are presumed to possess of searching native vessels in the Gulf, if, however, the Gulf ceased to be recognise.-; internationally as a special mono, it is open to queotion whether the customary right of search could be maintained. In these circumstances, Their lordships re^in5It aa essential that the adherence of Iraq and aaudi Arabia to the protocol should be obtained * t?or eiiailar reasons 9 They wwil i also regard it as essential for all power© who raijr^ht be likely to claim the privilege of their own flag in the Gulf to adhere to the protocol# including of course all the principal areas producing countries* The sec ml point which Their lordships desire to safeguard is the possibility that a new general convention Blight be cone laded emitting the Sersisa Gulf as a special sone# and the subsequent Treaty with ersia and protocol fall throu^i* They consider it essential that H# •Government should secure the new powers proposed before abandoning the powers which would have been obtained under the 1936 Draft Convention. 1 am also to draw attention to the enclosed telegraphic correspondence with the ckMomanders-in^Siief# Medl terranean and Kast Indies* Qepies of this letter have been eent to the India &lt;&gt;mce, iioard of 2rad«, ar Office, Air ;;lrdetry and Colonial Office* 1 an# Sir, Your obedient servant#-■ PTfl.iU'l —ESWaml for ..lla tarul Th#r * {3rc tw0 fti^arnerttal eonsideratlonr. which -hould be clearly craaped before thla queetion i 8 «» alned in detailt ,:e firBt i8 that oinoe ie aaeily poaaible for a tihow to cha ? «e the flag eh. file, to euit any warehip .he ,ay Bisht » a &lt;» trol which divides the power of auperviaion between the warahipo of this country and era.u is bound to be useless unless Sritiah ships are given the ;oo- er to eheek the illegal use of the era!an flag, i. e . the l^wer to ’ we iiy the flag”. it is Irrelevant to this whether or not the control exercised by j erelan ***** i&gt;rovee t0 be ei'iective, ,althon/^i in the Admiralty View it ie alinaoet certain that it will prove to be Ineffective. Ttie second cone Id era ti on Is that tl^e ’right to verify tlie flag differs essentially from the 'right of search or the right of detention ’. Hie two laet met Honed mean tn t, the cargo of the ship may be eac&amp;iained or the ah ip sent into port for further examination or for udioation. A definite and appreciable delegation of sovereignty ie, cx'ore« involved by ;the grant of these rights* on tiie other hiirid # the 'right to verify the flag” merely means t*iat 4he S lip*© paper© may be exa ined, and involves no 1 ocrference with her unless she turns out to be an imposter. The grant of this right» therefore, involves no such appreciable delegation of sovereignty, since it is only if a vessel is not entitled to the protection ohe claims by her flag that she maybe interfered vdth* Both the aove consideration© apply with equal force to the anas traffic and to the slave tra* e in the Oulf.73 - a - Both theoo evils are carried on by the aaae types of person ;n toe mm native craft j and they are also susceptible of control at sea t&gt;y the same means• ersla has been iafomed tliat l\. .Government are prepared to aatie with her a slavery 'Treaty abrogating the 1882 Convention ;vtiieh gave Britleh ships the right to search , ersian vessels), and substituting for it a regime under ehieli the , eraian avy would t&gt;e solely responsible for the mipewiaion and soar oh of vessels flying the ersian Flag on the high seas of the Gulf. It is now proposed to apply broadly the same principle to the Arms Traffic* lltie Admiralty opinion, ae stated above, is that any ouch divided system of control unices suitably supplemented is bound to be a failure; and they consider that both these Treaties logically involve the grant of the right to verify the I erslan flag in order to mke them effective. They suggest that as the Arms Traffic Treaty is now under consideration a serious attempt should be mace now to get the ereiana to grant us this right, bo that similar arrangements may in due course be applied to the slave trade when the new protocol again cones tip for discussion* The objections of he i ersian Government to the continuance of the l ersian Gulf as a 'special gone'' for arms traffic purposes are stated to be, firstly, that it Is derogatory to their national dignity that the Gulf should be placed under a regime (power to a 'bacitwarcV' area, and secondly, that a oonsidereble interference with legitimate Persian Trade would be involved, by the diversion of dhows suspected of illicit traffic. oth these objections (although grossly exaggerated - particularly the second) can be urged with eome show of reason against the regime of the 'social zone'but they &amp;re not Tulld objeetlene against a proposal to permit British ships, under a regime In which the speelal zone has bc«m abolished, to reriiy the right of reeeela to ay the I erelan nag.

Proposals suggested by Persia are at present under discussion m London to remove the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman from special maritirae zones in Arms Traffic Qfcnventicn and to conclude bilateral treaty with Persia under which latter would exercise sole responsibility for supervision of vessels flying Persian flag in Gulf and would declare that she claimed no right to supervise non-Persian shipping and would raise no objection to H. .Ships doing so. This Treaty would be followed up by a protocol signed by principal powers recognising Anglo-Feraia agreement and indicating that Contracting powers would have no objection to British warships supervising vessels flying their flags in the Gulfs.

Maritime) zone should be retained in the l ersian Gulf and Gulf of Oman if possible Persian susceptibilities being met by extension of powers to all vessel (?nnder a) certain size instead of only to native vessels/ It is noted that under the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention Persia if a signatory would have seme rigfr of general maritine supervision as ourselves and would have sole right in her own territorial waters. Paragraph 2. (? If) retention of the maritime zone proves impracticable I consider that the suggested bilaterial treaty with Persia might be accepted substitute provided (a) right to verify flag flown is accorded (b) suggested protocol by the principal powers indicating that they would have no objection to British warships supervising vessels flying country (countries) flag (s) would in fact be obtainable. Paragraph 3. With regard to (a) experience has shown that -he right of verification of flag flown is the first essential when gun running or (?slave) trading has to be dealt with. If versification were not possible gun runner(s) could avoid all supervision by changing flag to suit warship sighted. Paragraph 4. it might no doubt be necessary to give Persia reciprocal right(s) of verification of flag but she would in any case have this right under the 1925 Arms (?Traffic Convention if she became a signet ory thereto. Paragraph 5. With regard to (b) proposed protocol appears to confer rights wider than those accorded by the Arms Traffic Convention as supervision preaa mably includes right of search If such wider rights were unobtainable consider that the lesser (?rights) visualised (?by the) (?Arms) (?Traffic) Convention would be acceptable. Paragraph 6. It appears desirable that (?Ira(i) and (?possibly Hedj should be parties to the protocol as well as the principal Powers. Paragraph 7. I am not clear as to whether the ..'roposed, Persian declaration that she wonII raise ( • no objection) to (? H*M.Ships) supervising non (? Persian) shipping would apply in Persian territorial waters but if teo this would seem a desirable extension of the power accorded by the (‘’Arms) Traffic Convention (?full stop) Paragraph 8. Persian Pavy has recently been very active and it is not considered safe assumption that its supervision will be in future negligible. If gun running revives in the Persian all it is considered necessary in the present conditions to visualise co-operation between H.M#Ships and the Jersian^Navy in its_ suppression. 1714Z/8./ With the complifiian^s- of\tpie jr*. &amp; • Secretary of the Admiralty, f*.

The Ahmlralty, moreover, regard it ns ,ost important that *e saould not specifically abandon any alights - of however shadowy a nature - which we mey locally be believed to posoe88* 6. Asaunjin^ for a moment that we were able to £^11 In completely with the Admiralty view not only as to our ultimate object but also as to the method for trying to ettaln it, what would ha one n would, I think, be as follows* e should press at Oeneva for the full retention of the zones as defined in the 1925 Convention and for the inclusion of the Persian Qulf and the Oulf of Oman in the Maritime r^one* Supposing we succeeded in getting a sufficient measure of agreement on this to make practical politics (which we in the foreign office seriously doubt-, the first result would be that the Persians would (however unreasonably) withdraw from the conference, uiddevelop one more active grievance against ua, which they could be relied upon to exploit to the full* fney would immediately embark on energetic propaganda at Geneve, irstly with a view to creating s general prejudiceprejudice egainat our policy on ihe gr. und th«t they had *&gt; ° ri ’ efred UB fln a^range-Hjnt b.- rhloh - e could have got all w nted ® d b y »Uh Lheo, but that «e had preferred to quarrel with theoj ana eecondly, ^ith a view to rendering inoperative In practice any arrengcnentB for the control of the Illicit traffic m emo which 'nijrht merge fr-n the Conference* T'tey would certainly insist on their full legal righta In the i’erston Oulf, end we can be quite sure that the;- v uld Inoedlatel y challenge our right to control any heratan shinning and lfie •trongeot protest If we continued to do on. ab you Know, the .'Irian of 1897 would not help us in such circuwatancos, and whatever mistaken iipresa ion ny at present exist in the oulf that wc have a right to control Persian suips. It would very noon be dissipated, probably iht real It of i net dent r. which light well trove very densglng to our prestige. 7.

If w© decide on o policy which involves definitely felling foul of the Persians over ell shipping questions in the Persian Gulf, we may be &lt;*uite sure that such Incidents will be of frequent occurrences end, so we shell be powerless to take effective measures to invent them, our ureatlge along the ' ■iOie ox the Arab const ie likely to suffer very seriously Indeed. Moreover, we are still a very long way from a settlement of the Henjen question, and ate till, pt? you know, under notice to quit, ’fo provoke a situation of acute Anglo—Persian friction in the Gulf seems to mo the best possible way of bringing about effective Persian insistence on our immediate withdrawal, Tf we are to ma^eany further uttei &gt;t to reach a friendly oetUe'ient of tho Henjom cuestion, — which we here earnestly deeiire - It seems essential not to emlittrle at this sta^e on an avoidable quarrel with Pcrale over maritime questions in the Persian Otilf* • 0 &gt;'it Ic/v us s'j % ose that wi ar&gt;e r&gt;re ;ared to faue all ris^s and to go anoad on tho lines you suggest. Thv majority of powers who will sign the new Convention providing for the inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Oulf of (Han in the Special ''orlti^e Zone will only do ho very reluctantly and half-heartedly. e shall be ixtremely lucky if we get an ^sny ratifications sa wc obtained in the Convention of 1926. Some of the Pom re imy well sign with no intention of ratifying, re nay thm acquire a few very United rights; hut we *iny be equally sure that the present indeterminate end provisional situation will not continue, ©nd that we shall he called upon to produce legal Justification for any rights which we try to exercise. V own feeling is that the result of ell this will be to leave ns ^ith far fev^er effective rights than we possess at present, or than we are lively /toto ©cquirtf by any wethod of conciliation end spreo’ftent. The Persians are already asking whet rights we clai* to exercise ©t present, and have hinted pretty broadly that they mean to challenge the'?. I feer that in these clrcima tenses to rely on 'iftoroV 1 claims will be worse then use less. 9. Now whet would be the position if* our proposals were agreed to and could be got through! The principle of the special zones in oil the other areas concerned would be maintained, and night ever, be made considerably more effective, as we should have disposed of the main attack against it* In the Persian Gulf we should make e bilateral agreement with the Persians by which we should not be renouncing any right which we could possibly ho.iie to maintain by any other means, but should be securing a guarantee from the Persians that they would not in future claim to control any of the shin ing flying the flag of any of the Arab States with which we are in soeci 'l relations. This declaration would have been secured by friendly agreement, end even if the Persians should thereafter wish to provoke an incident, which /ist! is u-Uikeli . they would b» in a., Wil mk « position internatlonelljr that we anoald be able to take a strong and effective line in dealing with it. 'e ahould. by meeting the Persians’ wishes over this convention, have gone 8 long way to iw ‘roving Anglo-fcrelsn relations in the Gulf, and the effect of such an improvement ’ might well prove far-reaching. ' ’ Apart from having thus secured immunity for non-Persian vessels p c3P8l8n control, we should, a 8 u 5 &gt; zone out of our vay to re^ch a friendly agreement with the Peraiana, be in a far .xon^r ^sition at Geneve to obtain the effective oo-o^eration of the other Powers in connection with the othoi eseeaures which we regard ae neceasary for securing the cont^l of non-Persian shi;, : tncs Tt is true that the iowers ^ay be reluctant to hand over the control, over all non-Persian shipping solely to t-in ^ejeoty's Government, end may seev to obtain a share in that control themselves. If so, however, and provided we had already secured, by cmr pro ^oned bilateral /conventionI convention vtth Per«in f the non-Participation or Persia * ^ iri euch coritro1 * I not think we should have any | objection* ih© position would be that the new I multilateral convention, to give effect to the bilateral f Anglo-Peraian agreement, would m practice amount to -rnotiesi 4* the seme thing as the 19,;6 convention, except that Perair's face would have been saved and I her ®^Pping would be specifically excluded in terms instead of being excluded by the mere fact of the abstention of Persia* further, the errangements would oc?^*n secured v?117.ingl e y end by friendly co-operation, cn’i we might, as a result, obtain e far larger number ol fcij. ioations not only for the Pex : sian Gulf protocol out, also for the convention as s whole# il* I confess that when I cow pare these two solutions, X find it difficult to see what we should gt.in by insisting on the first, ©nd it seems to me thr*i. Ivy nailing our colours to the mast of the VJ25 convention, in so far as the Persian Gulf ana the Gulf of umsn are concerned, we should only be losing the substance for the shadow* 12. The Persian Charge d’/ffaires is not /unnaturallyunnatuiTiHi' preosing Tor an answer to the official rironosalB which onsleur Scpahhodl nade to the Secretary of Sti te on April 84th, and X greatly hope that.

The Persians have always taken the strongest exception to this classification, wnich they regard as offensive to L, helr ^nour oropre . &lt;Ve, on the other hand, have consistently regarded it as of great importance to maintain effective control of the traffic in arms in tne Gull, since in the past tnis has been one of the principal areas tnrougn which amis nave percolated to tne North Went Frontier.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 3 of the 7th January, 1933, regarding the retention in any general Disarmament Convention of the provisions for the establishment of special zones which are included in the Anns Traffic Convention of 1925, and to inform you that in consultation with my advisers I have given consideration to the possibility of devising alternative measures in the event of the special zones being abandoned. 2. Should the opposition to the retention of the zones prescribed in Chapter III of the 1925 Convention be too great I suggest that it might be found possible to reach agreement that a special maritime zone, comprising the whole of the Red Sea, should be retained and that the measures of control provided in Chapter III should be applicable thereto. I make this suggestion because the Red Sea is the main channel of supply of arms to the Arabian Peninsula. 3. There is no satisfactory alternative to the retention of the special zones. If it should be necessaiy to acquiesce in their abandonment it might be possible to reach an understanding, reference to which could be made in T ne Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, Cr.B.E. ,M.P., etc., etc., His kajesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.109 in the general Disarmament Convention, that the governments ol Palestine, Xrans-Jordan, _gypt (including oinai), Syria and Iraq, and possibly of Saudi Arabia, should enter into negotiations for the adoption of reciprocal arrangements for the control of arms traffic between the several countries. I realise that ciilficulty would be caused by the fact that in some of those countries the carryir^ o_ ar s is prohibited save under licence, while in Trans jordan there is no such control. 1 have already considered the possibility of disarming the settled population in Tran a-Jordan and although 1 do not think that this can yet be done I am anxious that as soon as conditions appear to be more favourable a beginning may be made by providing for the registration of firearms in Iran s-j ordan West of the Hejaz Railway.

In the Convention drawn up the Persian cm the Oman Gulfs, contrary to the principle of the freedom of the sets, wOl'q included in special a ones, in which the trr ffio in arms by '’native” vessels of less than JOO tons were □ubJsotud co special regulations# These nones were exceptions to other maritime areas of the world, and in view of the £ ot that the inclusion of the Persian and the Oman Gulfs in these sonea was inimical to Persian interests, the Persian delegate* to tho Conference tried at that time to explain the situation of their country to the Conferonoe and especially to the British delegates# Unfortunately, owing to oertnin olroumstanoos they wei*e unable to bring the Conference, and particularly the British delegates, to an appreciation of tho Persian standpoint# Therefore, the Persian delegates withdrew from the Conference# Since that time the Persian Government have be n at pains on various occasions to point out tho defects of lMs Convention from the Persian point of view, and many times the Persian delegates at the Council of tho League of nations and elsewhere op plied for a revision of the Convention# The Persian Government are ready to recognise tho lawful rights of other cowers in these parts, and are, moreover, willing to co-operate fully with the British Gov crimen t in /preventing.rg.L'.JiT * f2Z rrsironting any illioit trading In arms in thosa parts. In this way it is considered that both the British etandpoint sr.i rftpsj.o..i ^.r-sfcige wovild be adequately saTe-guardedt, in rder t- atte.\n this end the Persian Minieter for Foreign Affairs presented to His Britannia Majesty's Minister at T. hr ran th.- draft of a propoaod bi-lateral Convention, and the ; araian Oovernment arc cf opinion that such a Convention, whilst safeguarding British interests, would erente no Prejudice to Persian prestige in regard to Persia's f.n.iy .utle* to the opeh sea. They are hopeful that, in view * ‘ * ; i•;nd),y relations happily existing between the two countries, thr British Govern®^* will eae their way to agree to this proposal without the necessity of including the Gulra in tho special zon^Qo mxen t ^ e Conference for the reduction and limitation of armaments we 9 convened in Genova in 1952, it was decided that the 1925 Convention be reused end incorporated in the final Convent U n .f that Conftr«^e^, it should be remeichered that ..v .05 .vODvention ? no’v uaving rcceivtsd the requisite number ci ratifications by the Powers concerned, still remains n w.A-aj.t Convention and hee not therefore com- into force, Persian delegate on the apecial eoicmittee and sub—committee has explained ttte' situation.- and the committee nae agreed that the Persian Government have certain difficulties that should be taken into account? and if I remember well the Br^u^sh delegate expressed the opinion that the present Persian situation is different from that of 1925* I need to explain this point that, although the proviston* of the 1926 Convention seem to be of general application they are in reality directed solely towards vessels -t lying the Persian flags because Persian vessels w*e mostly of less than c00 ton^ and fall in the category of !f natiw o H *; r :'nstire shipping'. Thopsfors this would apply to rsseals of the other signatory Power., which are generally of more than 600 tonnage. Furthermore, the inspection of these weasels la so regulated that after a time no such vessel would be able to carry on its lawful trade, for if vessels ara diverted a few time, by the formalities of inspection from their regular course they will be compelled to give up their work. The Permian Government have bean awaiting the view of the British Qoverment on the propoeal of the Persian Minister for Poreion Affaire made to the British Minister at Teheran. However, in the meantime the British delegate to the Disarmament Conference insists upon the obeemng of the provisions of the 1985 Convention regarding special zones, and ■ only concession made by him is to delete the word 'native' fro* v.tsmla of less than 500 tone. As mentioned above, the Persian Government are convinced that by adhering to a bi-lateral Convention the British Government will achieve their purpose. Moreover, the close inspection of the coasts of Arabia (both in the Indisa Ocean and the Persian Gulf), the Gulf of Aden and the Red 3ea will prevent any illicit trade in arms. If the British Gov^nment ttealred it, the peralaa Government would readily consent to the propoeed bi-lateral Convention being included in the general Convention of the Disarmament Conference ar4 left open to be observed by other powers* In consideration of the sincere friendship between Persit and Great Britain* the Persian Government are hopeful that the British Government will refrain from adopting their Policy of 19P5 in including the two Gulfs in special zones by which Persian prestige would be prejudiced and her free &amp;nd lawful trade with other parte of the world impaired*1 -• • • v fin m 2n order to conrey to Your Excellency the views of my Government on this sublet, I have been epecially Inetructed to -cme to London and my Government cherieh the hope that their ewe, which I submit are not opposed to the intereete or policy of ms Brittanio Majesty’s Government.will be shared to them, the Pension Government being convinced that the aeration of the British Government to this end would produce the 'best effect in PereiGo If ’ Unf0rtUn9te ly» th9 of the Persian Government are not shared by the British Government, the Persian Government would be of opinion that their further participation in the proceedings of the Disarmament Conference would serve no useful purpose, because it is inconceivable that any Government could present to Parliament for ratification a Convention which ie opposod to the prestige of the country and impaired its trade in the sole outlet it possessed to the open sea. In such case the Persian delegation to the Disarmament Conference would be under the necessity of explaining the 8it ' :an ' R t0 Conf * r * nc « stating that any decision the Conference took regarding the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, ' r aay thfc ’ r lsattei ' affacting my country, would not be oinding ..n Perata aco.ci'ding to international law. As my Government are not desirous of taking any steps in ■PPOsition to the view of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, I am presenting the whole, case for your Excellency's kind onsiceration, in the hope that you will be able to eee your 'ay to request the authorities concerned that the views of the Persian Government on this matter may be taken into serious -nsidei a»..ion, so that Persia can continue uninterruptedly her participation in the work of the Disarmament Conference. Oo^aed the meeting by deeoriblng the events which had led up to the despatch of Foreign office letter on the retention, in any international instrument which should replace the abortive Arms Traffic Convention of 1938 , # of the Persian Gulf indifferent to such objections, and there were indeed certain appreciable advantages in making sure that Persia did not participate in the proposed new Convention, since, if she stood out it, there would he less risk of her acquiring any rights to visit and control Arab dhows. The situation had now, however, somewhat changed, it appeared that the Persian Government attached a quite die- proportionate importance to the question 8 and, in the opinion of His Majesty^ Minister at Tehran which was shared by the Foreign office, there would be great political advantage;, in -^aching some agreement with the Persians on the subject, if this could be done without sacrificing the main objects which Hi.s Majesty T s Government wished to secure. The Persian Government had now sent their Minister in Herne on a special lesion to London to raise the matter personally with the b^cretary of state. Prom the interview which Monsieur Sopahbodi had with Sir John Simon on April 24th, it appeared that the main P^aGcoupation of the peroian Government was to secure the exemptionexemption of Phelan veesele from liability to visit and control by foreign warships, and that, contrary to our previous impression, the Persians were more or less indifferent to what was done regarding ships not flying the Persian flag. Moreover, it now appeared that the Persian Government would ntvo no objection to the aaglo-persian bi-lateral agreement which they had proposed being supplemented by some general arrangement by which His Majesty's Government should acquire the right to control the shipping of other nationalities in the two Gulfs. There wau no hope of British naval authorities acquiring any effective right to control Persian shipping under any of the arrangements which had been proposed, since the Persians were determined not to become parties to any arrange- ment on the lines of the 1925 convention, it therefore looked as though we might secure Just ae much by the new arrangements now tentatively suggested as we should have secured by our original policy, while the adoption of the alternative policy ncrcv proposed would have the further advantage of avoiding an inconvenient quarrel with the Persian Government, and the v.-. nation of a possibly invidious atmosphere at Geneva which might prove very unfortunate if it should become necessary to go back to the League on the question of the Anglo-per olein oil dispute. Moreover by the arrangement now proposed we should obtain a very useful guarantee against Persian intervention with Arab shipping. Memivihile the Persian representatives had made it clear that if Hie Majesty’s Government insisted on pressing for inclusion of the two Gulfs in the special maritime zone* ^rsia would feel obliged to withdraw altogether from the Disarmament Conference. It would be preferable to avoid this.If poearns, particularly ae the Ration uppsared to bo regarded at Gcasta ao almost solely an Aa*lo-i&gt;,rUaa ctncern ,o that if Persia sithdre* from the Conference aa a reault of our attitude, we should certainly be repreaented in league circles, which were alwaya inclined to be prejudiced in farcur of the smaller power, aa haring adopted an obetructire and bullyinr attitude. The Persians could be relied on to sake the most of thia and would contend that they had put forward alternative proposals under whiob we could have obtained all our desiderata, but which we had turned down without ad.,uate reason, on the other hand, if wo could show that we had gone . ut of our A'ay to meet the Peroiano over this question and could present the Disarmament Couferenca with an Anglo-Persian Agreement on what was regarded as mainly an Anplo-persian dispute, there w.-.a reason to believe that the Conference would l&gt;e oc favourably impressed that they would make little difficulty about concluding the multilateral protocol which w© should require. DmAcJcwerte referred 'to the correspondence which had recently passed between Mr, Soul and Mr. laithwaite regarding the position in which Arab dhowa would be placed if Persia were after all to accede to cm arrangement on the lines of the 1925 Convention. The correspondence, he maintained, kad afcnwn that even in such an eventuality Arab dhowa wou2d en,1oy legal immunity from Persian interference* Monsieur Sspahbodi had himself pleaded that in practice the only vessels which would be liable, under the 1925 Convention, to supervision would be Persian craft, and it was a fact that the number of registered United Kingdom vessels under 500 ton* in the Persian GulfIt foilwM . — ■ l1liu , ' P “’* S ,0 “t^i-tTOnt. » f at. tujo.tf. t m ,, anx , serious drawback to the revival 0 f the l»sfi Asree-wri x # the danger lest Per eis ehould acquire the right to dhows - was is reality illusory, and that Hi.

Not only would Peraia not agree to it, and withdraw fre* the conference if it were nr eased, but it was very prdbabla that other delegatee would side with the Persians, indeed if refused -.insider the Persian auggeetlon and nailed our colours to the meet of the 19£5 Convention, it wao very douhtfhl whether we should in oractiee acquire any of the rights we desired, since there was reason to believe that few of the other Powers were interested in the matter, and it wae llhely therefore, that we ehould meet with considerable difficulty in securing a sufficient number of signatures or at any rate ratifications to raahe our policy workable, to. Barnes observed that in this natter of eras traffic oontrol Hie Majesty's Government had pursued an entirely -oneistent and single-minded policy for upwards of forty years, during aoet of which time no opposition had been forthcoming from the Persian aide. Moreover it had received general acceptanceacceptance b, man, Powers, and the 1*56 convention had been ratified bjr no lees then thirteen countries, was it not a pity to break this long tradition at the present stage and go off on e fresh tack merely tc meet the ill-cone idered whim Of one onoivilieed member of the toaguet in this connexion the Anairalty representatives quoted from a receat letter by the Secretary of State on another phase of the control of the traffic in arms. vi*. the question of licencing arrange- amta, in which Sir John Simon had emphasised the desirability of pursuing an unwavering policy. Kr. Rendel did not consider that the fact that we had pursued a consistent policy for a long period was relevant to the present issue. Conditions in the Persian Gulf had conpl-tely changed in the last few year a and the fact that a certain policy wee appropriate in nineteenth century conditions wea an arguioenv against rather than in favour of the appropriate* jf each a policy to-day* Persia was now a centralised and violently nationalist State. Traditional practices which had grown up while Persia had practically no central Government and which were based on no legal right did not afford any satiwffectory basis for our policy to-day. But the question was aot wo asuh one of a change of policy - for no change of policy was suggested - but of a change of method. The Foreign off!os wars only supporting the nresent proposal because they fblt that it would enable Hie Majesty’s Government to secure thair objects no leas completely than the policy hitherto advocated, but by sllphtly different methods t which would avoid auch nnnaosseary and possibly politically dangerous friction, 51,3 Bight even present certain nraetical advantages. Mr. BarnesM£o_Jarnea doubted whether Persia would withdraw altogether from the Disarmament Conference If she failed to get what she wanted. It was ho thnno*.* «. it uaw, ne -cnouphu, much more reasonable to suppose that she would merely make the necessary reservations in regard to this specific question. H is Majesty-a Government, in similar circumstances, would never dream of withdrawing altogether from a Conference, m any case,, the policy which Kis Majesty’s Government had consistently maintained was obviously straightforward and of a nature to win general sympathy; he therefore saw no reason to anticipate an unfrvourable attitude on the part of the delegates of the Other powers at Geneva as a whole, and he reminded the meeting that the attitude of those delegates in other cognate matters he.d not proved so unreasonable« • .rtcnuel observed tiiat while it might be reasonable -ior uhe Persians to do no more than make a reservation in regard, to the proposed inclusion of the two Gulfs in the special 2cne ? it was useless to expect them to follow so moderate and reasonable a courseo The question had become one of national presuige, and the Persians, apart from their more uractical objections, had made it a point of honour not to subscribe in any way to an instrument which would place the only maritime approaches to Persia in the same category as wholly uncivilised and barbarous areas which could only be adequately controlled by international action« Mr. Rendel, therefore, felt convinced that the Persian threat of withdrawing from the Conference if the proposal were pressed, w^s a genuine one, and that it would be useless to expect the Persians to take the more reasonable course described by Mr® Barnes.- r -- 3aa ^ roana 11; hard ^0 Doliav* that the Persians wotild really consider the proposed multilateral protocol f-h c . con.;.,! oniv re made with their implied concurrence because it depended on the bl-lateral agreement) more palatable than wie general arrangements contemplated under the 1926 Convention. Tnit. protocol would in effect re-establish the Sulf as a special stone, and he thought that the Persians them selves must have misunderstood the wider implications of their own latest proposal* A further discussion ensued regarding the vagaries of Persian psychology and the Persian dislike of any general international instrument which would imply the existence of a state of lawlessness in the two Gulfs or in the bordering Persian territory. Colonel Fowle and Mr# Laithwaite supported the Foreign Office contention that the Persian Government fully grasped the implications of their proposal, and that, from the point of view of His Mu jesty^s Government, the form mattered far lees than the practical result* Captain Ponclcwerts xium suggested that acceptance of the new proposals might have a very adverse effect on British prestige in the Persian Gulf. What, he asked, would be the reaction of the local Arabs (wihose contempt for the Persians was well-known), if they were to be told that His Majesty's Government had abandoned their hitherto unswerving policy merely in order to please Persia, and had publicly renounced their right to supervise Persian shipping? Mr. Rendel pointed out that that right would be lost in any case, and that what was required was to prevent uuy risk of the Persian navy interfering with non-porslan shipsehipe and to make cure that we retained the right to do ^ H eaident expressed the »lew that the Gulf Arabs were not Interested In international instruments what they judged by was or act leal reaulta. if they found, as they would find, that the changes now proposed left them as immune a 8 ever from Persian interference, they would continue to respect us*. M r j»_ Hendel urged that the new proposal might even be oreferable from the point of view of local prestige. For if we quarrelled with Poreia over this question or if Porsia considered herself aggrieved, she could, and almost certainly would, provofce a succession of incidents which it would be difficult .0 setule satisfactorily and which in the aggregate would prove distinctly damaging to our position in Arab eyes. In recent years Persia's treatment of Bahreinis resident in Persia was a sufficient illustration of the fact that it was not always possible to secure for Gulf Arabs the immunity from persecution to which their independent national status legally entitled them, and we should be far more likely to put a stop 10 such difficulties if we could come to some friendly agree ment with Persia. Mr. Lao cel lea observed that the Admiralty, in urging the UMfcixed advantage of the policy embodied in the 1925 Convention, appeared to have overlooked the fate of British Indian dhows, of which, he understood, there was a considerable number in Gulf waters. If both Persia and India were to accede to an agreement on the lines of the 1925 Convention, Persian ships would acquire the definite right to 'Supervise' Indian dhows, and he thought that the probable abuse of that rightWa8 an inp0rtant faotor ln “y review of the relatire merite of the old and new proposals from the point of view of local prestige. Cagtain Panckwerts suggested that acceptance of the Persian proposal might give rise to difficulties with Itm saod, whose territory also bordered on the Gulf. Might not the Saudis demand similar special arrangements? The Foreign Off ice and India Qfflne rep resen tatives thought this contingency remote. The Hasa coastline was comparatively short, and there were hut row Saudi Arab dhows in Irulf waters. Moreover, ibn Send was on good terms with Eis Majesty's Government, and he was not likely to object to an arrangement the chief result of which would be to assure his people immunity from Persian interference. The same considera tions, they thought, applied to Iraq. Another objection raised by the Admiralty r ^presentatives was to the effect that the 1985 tfoavention, though abortive, did in nractice confer on Hifi Majesty's Government what amounted in the eyes of local Persians to a ripht to supervise shipping; the nroposed bilateral agree- meno would definitely destroy this useful illusion. The Foreign office and India Office representatives felt that it was no longer possible to roly on such illusory rights ,, w Wtule the future of the 1925 Convention was still uncertain they might have some value. But once the matter had been finally dealt with and regularised by the new arrangements, whatever they were, any rights we tried to ^zeroise would have to depend on something much more tangible* Wing-Commander McClaughry wondered whether, under an arrangementerrangencnt t»».a on tn. no. proso., 1 ,, onnjgn^ no. nonnon in ■ nr...n »- e „l» t6 u ^ not nitherto.

M^-Mithwalte agreed thet tnis was e consideration of seme weight, and that the difficulty could probably be overcome by careful drafting, Th^Adniraity representatives were not convinced tnat ether Powers would consent to any arrangement whereby nxs Majesty's Ships would acquire the sole right to supervise their vessels in the two Gulfs, They thought tnat the other P were, whan approached, would certainly claim complete reciprocity*, Mr, Rendel doubted this. Th£ League Committee as a wholo had made it quite plfin that they regarded the Question of the Persian Gulf as almost entirely an Anglo- Persian one and he thought that if any reasonable solution, acceptable to both His Majesty’s Gcvemment and the Persian ^rnment, were put forward, the other delegates would a r ^ept it with relief, especially as His Majesty’s Ocvernment uM with truth claim to have abandoned their former P f sition only with great reluctance and in order to be accommodating® Moreover, even if cth^r Powers iee c Powers ‘he. than Persia did claim reciprocity - i.e. the dame rightright as His Majesty-a Overrunent to control non-PeraUn vcsss.ts ■ ttif pceition would ba no worse than it would have been under tie abortive 1925 Convention. fiaptflAtt Dgnckwerta remarked that « third solution was ^cnceivabls, namely, a bilateral arrangement between the United Kingdom only on the one hand, and Persia on the other, on a baaia of complete reciprocity, the vessels of uach party being liable to supervision by the warships of the i ther party as well as by their own. This, he reminded the meeting, had been Mr, Hoare’a own original proposal. it would, he thought, prove more palatable to the Persians, who we.-e always faacinated by the idea of reciprocity and it seemed the only practicable method of obtaining the right to control Persian vessels. To this the Admiralty attached great importances This suggestion brought to a head a I«ng-a tending divergence of views between the India Office and the Admiralty* l^Jndia omce rep resentativeColonel Powle were strongly pposad to any arrangement which aight give Persian warships tne right to interfere with Arab dhows, while the Admiralty .C'-iprcger;tativ*3 wer»e inclined to see the Question in the light of a conflict between the narrow interests of the Trucial Sheikhs and the wider issue of the utility of control measures ss a whole 0 a less acute difference of opinion arose regarding the question whether in fact the Persians would welcome reciprocity in this particular casdo Mr* Rendel pointed out that such reciprocity would £ - ably be regarded by them as illusory* The main objection xiie Persians to the 1925 arrangements was that such arrange- ni iits would render all Persian shipping liable to visit and control by foreign warships* Their principal object in Proposing a bilateral arrangement was to avoid this, and a reciprocalreciprocal arrangements a8 that suggeeted by captain Panekwerts would, therefore, be uaeleee to them. Moreover, Xt would be obvious that there would be no real reciprocity in eucn an arrangement, Qi nce there were practically no UnU#d KingdCm Sillps in the GW under 500 tone, eo that practically no United Kingdom ship, would become subject Vi8it by th8 Perslan nav V' whereas practically the whole = Persian shipping would be erposed to control by British warships. Again the Persians had only a few inefficient warships while His Majesty's Government could always send a sufficient number of warships to the Gulf. The so-called 'reciprocal-' arrangement would therefore obviously valuable and far reacning rights on His Majesty's Government than on the Persians, The Persians would be the first to realise this inequality, and would regard a proposal for a reciprocal arrangement as a “lap. In any cae« it would be very difficult to limit the P '‘ oieR '' ght6 uhder such an arrangement to United Kingdom ip8 ° Th * Parsians would claim rights over Indian and P &lt;bably over various Arabian dhows, and there would bu a constant danger of incidents. ,v’afiiai»_k«il£5w«rts thought that too much weight should attachea to the explanations furnished by Monsieur j ahbc c i i n regard to the interference to which Persian shipping might bo oxp.: sed. Tho only ships which would '’ eally 3uff, er ii'icpnvsniance from maritime supervision were ' ■ -? engaged in the illicit armst raffle and anyhow it was - -urc to suggest (as Monsieur Sepahbodi had done) that j ' uslan vessels might be “taken away to distant ports for -vtigatiun more than once on the same Jcurney'. Turning naxt to the question of the procedure to - P d it the lergian proposals were to be furtner pursued, Mr. Barn es1*3 th* 'Arab .one' Tamb and Abu Musa, together with certain C islands the sovereignty over which, though not at present in dispute, was doubtful. Moreover, such an imaginary line would give rise to endless disputes. The Persians might easily contend that a Persian dhow had been visited by a British ship outside the zone, or that they had visited a non-Persian dhow inside it. when the true fasts were quite otherwise. In such oases it would be most difficult to establish the facts. Apart from this, however, the Admiralty representa - Uvea confirmed the original Foreign Office impression that suen an arrangement would be open to the gravest practical objectione, and would render effective control in any part of the two Gulfs extremely difficult. It was therefore agreed that the proposal need not be examined further for the present at any rate* Captain Pancfcwerts then suggested that it might be wor;,h considering a variant of the second Persian alternative t '7iz« a sort of narrow sea corridor along the Persian coast, giving vessels access to Persian ports without passing through the special Gulf sone 0 Such an arrangement, he thought 0 would estop the Persians from complaining that their only maritime access to the outside world was threatened with a special and derogatory regime of control* Mr* Rendel pointed out that such a sea n corridor' (or 'balcony') already existed in the shape of the narrow band of Persian territorial waters, within which the pro- Visions of the maritime zone would in no case be applicable* The Admiralty representatives , on their part, admitted that the scheme like the second Persian proposal, presented obvious praotioal difficulties, and it was agreed that144 6 proposal might be reserved for further examination solutions proved unworkable. Conclusion. S-omming up their general position, the Admiralty rejresenlatiyes stated that, in principle, and pending refer- enoe to their higher authorities, they still maintained their preference for a general Arms Traffic Convention with the Persian Gulf as a special zone, and that they would only he '■ ' ' :r ° a o an don the attempt to secure such an arrangement -i. iqu&amp;lly effective control could he obtained hy the alterna- method 0 The main objection to the proposal under discus sion was that under it the Persian flag would he inviolable, and to avoid this drawback they would prefer that the bilateral treaty should be on a basis of reciprocity,, Under no circum stances would an arrangement on the lines proposed be accept able unless the accession of a reasonably large number of other Powers had been obtained, as a condition precedent to the removal of the Persian Gulf from the convention as a special zone 0 Notwithstanding these reservations, they realised that the political, considerations advanced by the Foreign Office in favour of the new proposals were of consider able cogency, and they were impressed in particular by the disadvantages which might follow if Persia wero antagonised by being driven into a corner,, With the exception of Wing-Commander licClaughry (Air Ministry), who was inclined to share the views of the Admiralty, the representatives of the other ‘Departments (India Cifice. War Office and Colonial Office) and of the Political Kesident were definitely in favour of an attempt to reach an Tinderstending with the Persians on the lines suggested by the foreign Office; and it was suggested that the Foreign Office proposals that the if other'™ 0Sal8 8ll0U:ifi be Set forth detail in the form of a araft repl3 ' ^ MOnelenr Sepahb0dl (t ° ** sent through the Persian Charge d ! Affaires in London), for submission to, and further detailed examination b y , the other Departments concerned. That reply, it was agreed, should emphasise the reluctance ''■ th rhleb HiS f ^ eaty ' e Sovernmeat Tiewed the abandonment of their insistence on the inclusion of the two Gulfs in the meri- ti*e eone; it should lay down, as a definite condition of any such change of taction, that an adequate number of other 3t8tee Sh ° Wld aC ° ede ’ ^ ^rm of a protocol to the multi lateral agreement) to the proposed Anglo-Perslan bilateral tru:..„ru., a.id, -i. mally, it should make it clear that any further negotiations in regard to the new Persian proposal v uH- remain within the framework provided by the Disarmament Conference* The foreign Office agreed to submit a draft on these lines ’ Gnd a draft.which has, however, not yet been concurred i'i by the Departments concerned, is now attached (Annex A).

I4(p Draft note to /athollaii i:han i^oury-iiisfandiar^ Persian Cha.rg6 d ■'Affaires. London •Cn tbe course of Ms conversation with consideration by a sub-conuoittee of the iiisaraament Conference. Monsieur depahbodi expressed the earnest hope of the Persian Goirermnent that His Aiajesty g s GoTernment in the United L'ingdom would agree to the two Gulfs not being included in the proposed special inaritirae zone, and, on ray drawing his attention to the difficulties which the exclusion of this area from the zone might put in the way of the effective control in the traffic in arms, put forward, under instructions from his Government, certain alternative suggestions for14-7 a asating the situation. 2. Monsieur Sepahbodi's principal suggestion was that His fcajesty's Government should a^ree to conclude with the i^ersian Government a bilateral convention on the lines of the draft communicated &lt;,0 His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran by the Persian Government on November loth. 193 fc. ne explained that it was specifically provided in that draft (i*e. by Article 2) that on the high Seas of the two Gulfs the supervision and control of all vessels flying the Persian flag, which might be suspected of participation in the illicit traffic in arms, should be entrusted to the naval authorities of Persia, while the supervision and control on the High heas of the two Gulfs of all vessels suspected of the illicit traffic in arms, other than those flying the Persian flag, would be entrusted to the British naval authorities* Such a provision would, in the opinion of the Persian Government, give dis Majesty's Government all the rights whioh they could legitimately desire, would fully provide for the adequate control of the illicit traffic in arms in the two Gulfs and the adjacent areas, and would offer a full and sufficient guarantee against its recrudescence. 3. On my pointing out to Monsieur Sopanbodi in reply that it would be impossible to confer, by means of a purely bilateral convention of this type, rights on one of the contracting parties over /vesselsvessels flying the flag of a third party, Monsieur Sepahbodi explained that the Persian Government would see no objection to other powers acceding to the oroposed bilateral convention, or otherwise signifying their acceptance of its provisions in so x(xr as they and their vessels might be concerned* This might for Instance be done by means of a separate protocol to be concluded at the same time as the proposed bilateral convention* 4» aaonsieur Hepanbodi suggested as an alternative to the above suggestion that only the Arab side of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman should be included in the special maritime sone* and that the waters on the Persian side of the two Gulfs should be left free* l am informed, however, that this proposal would be liicely to meet with serious difficulties in practice* 5* I have now caused the Persian Governments suggestion for the conclusion of a bilateral agreement, on the lines of their draft of November 10th and for the conclusion of a multilateral agreement providing for the necessary concurrence therein of the other Powers concerned, to be most carefully examined by the competent authorities of His Majesty's Government* as the Persian Government are aware, it has long* been the constant endeavour of His itejesty'a Government to secure by every means in their power the strictest possible control over the illicit traffic in arms* Any relaxation in the efforts hitherto made to checx and control this dangerous /and/Government and pernioions traffic or an* public abundonEen „ by His Itajeaty's Government of an* of the rights hitherto exercised by them Kith a view to checking it, would be likely, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, to lead to a grave danger of its recrndescenoe. vith consequences which might well prove eoually serious to all concerned. For rainy years the principle of the special zones has been regarded by His Majesty's Government as one of the most effective moans for combatting this traffic, and it is clear that there are the gravest objections to weakening this principle by the removal from the special zone of a large area which has admittedly in the past been an active centre of the traffic. On the other hand. His Majesty's Government are anxious to co-operate with, and to meet the views of the Persian Government in this matter in the friendliest spirit in so far as they can do so consistently with their policy of maintaining the strictest possible effective control over the illicit traffic in arms. Provided therefore that the iaternative arrangements now suggested can be shown to be liicely to prove no less effective for this purpose than those hitherto contemplated, and that the new agreements proposed can be concluded in anticipation of or simultaneously with the main convention.

The Foreign Office comment on the proposals in that despatch is given in their covering letter of 06th April (P.Z.2421).

The In&amp;ia~Ci ; fice'^ug eetion at yesterday^ meeting that the pro^oeed bilateral 'Treaty with Persia should be limited to vessels M flyihg the Persian ^lag” (not Persian 'shipping' as originally suggested) has raised a new train of thought in our minde* which we fear was not expressed as clearly as it might have been at the meeting - for the reason that our ideas were not fully crystalised at the time# I think it would be generally agreed that as things are, although under the 19‘&amp; Convention we ehould hove no leg al right t o touch Persian vessels unless Persia came In, we should nevertheless retain a t oral., right, hocked no hv the concensus of world opinion, to stop Persian vessels which we knew, or strongly suspected on good evidence, to he engaged In Illicit ams traffic This right would become very strong if a serious recrudescence of anas traffic in the Cull arose. «?• should also keep the 1397 powers (i.e. the firman) W# Rindel» Koq.» C#M*GsYou will remember that even with the Convention unratified all the departments concerned were prepared to agree that Persian vessels might be searched for arms on the high seas There definite information or very strong suspicion exists, and that standing instructions in this sense were issued to the Senior Naval Officer and are now in force. We think here that a Convention generally ratified although without Persia would be of inestimable value if there were a weakening of central control either in Persia, so that arms traffic through Baluchistan again became a possibility, or in Saudian Arabia, so that the smuggling of arms through El Hasa for use against Transjordan, Koweit, or Iraw became a risk to be reckoned with. If we understand your proposals aright, it is a necessary feature of the bilateral Treaty that we should renounce in positive terms any conceivable right we may possess to touch vessels flying the Persian f 1 ag....on t»}i6 nigh seas# The Persian iTLag wouldj therefore, for the first time, become formally and legally recognised as a complete cover for any vessel flying it and - this is our point - there is no ef fectiv ejaeans for checkin/ its indiscriminate use All-disposed person of whatever nationality, since the control exercised by the Persian Navy would be negligible. Our fears are increased by the consideration that our arms traffic treaty with Persia would form the model for the eventual Slave Traffic Treaty with that country - and we do not think H.M* * Government would like to face the prospect of a revival of this traffic under cover of the i ersian flag in circumstances where we should be helpless to interfere# *e do, therefore, wish to press you to consider most carefully whether something could not be put into the Bilateral Treaty which would enable us to check the indiscriminate use of the Persian flag by unauthorised persons#••persons. Could we not* therefore, proceed on the following basis for the Persian Treaty, v/ith the object of saving the Persia face? (a) Persia to declare that she accepted sole responsibility for the control of shipping lawfully flying the Persian flag on the high seas of the Gulf, and that she would, for her part, raise no objection to H»M. Ships exercising control of other shipping on the high seas of the Gulf. (b) U.X. to take note of the Persian declaration. (c) Both parties to agree to co-operate in checking the use of the Persian flag by unauthorised persons. For this puroose Persia would agree that II.M. Ships might have the right in suspiciotis caoes to verify that the vessel is authorised to fly the Persian flag. This right to include no power of detention or diversion, except (a) where the flag was unauthorised, or (b) viiere it was incidentally discovered that illicit...illicit ams were being conveyed. In both cases the vessel would be handed over at once to the competent Naval authorities of the power to whom she belonged. Our preference for the pure doctrine of the 1925 Convention remains as strong as ever, and we are at present quite unable to say definitely that anything else would be acceptable to our Higher Authorities, v/e do however feel that if the Persian flag remains sacrosanct/ effective Naval control in the Gulf disappears, and we cannot hold out any hope that our authorities would willingly accept such a position. I am sending copies of this letter to Laithwaite, Pierse, James, Murray and Marker, and am suggesting to the first named that India Office might defer consulting the Government of India until this possibility has been explored.

Lear Seal, Many thanks for your letter of yeaterday aboul the Arms Traffic Convention. The proposals which have now been circulated by the Foreign Office for discussion this afternoon seem prima facie attractive (subject to a definition of 'non-Persian vessels 11 which will cower Bahrein, Koweit, and the other Arab Sheikhdoms to which claims of varying importance are or have been put forward by Persia) and if we can reach agreement on this basis the question of Persian rights of inspection of Arab vessels under the Arms Traffic Convention will no longer be of active importance. But by way of clearing the ground I might place on record our present point of view on certain of the points that have arisen. Position of the Arab Sheikhdoms ..i n relation to treaties and International Conventions* 2# Bahrein and Koweit are independent Arab principalities, under British protection, but not British protectorates* The Trucial Sheikhdoms (including Qptai} are, as stated in P.G.13, 'independently administered tribal principalities governed by independent Arab Sheikhs'; entitled to protection from us in varying degrees* By agreement, the foreign relations of all the above are in the hands of His Majesty^ Government, and the Rulers may have * Seal Esq., ADMIRALTY.have no correspondence or relations with any foreign power or its representative# Muscat is an independent State in special Treaty relations with us, and entitled in certain circumstances to a measure of protection from us, hut with foreign treaties and foreign relation^bf its own. 3. For general political reasons we are anxious to keep the foreign relations of al] the above States (including even Muscat so far as practicable) entirely in our own hands; and, save in the case of Muscat, which under pressure from us acceded to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, we have therefore never contemplated or wished to encourage, their independent accession to International agreements or conventions# On the other hand, so as to avoid any ground for complaint from interested foreign powers, we aim at securing that in practice these States shall so far as possible (i#e# making allowance for special local circumstances) conform to the provisions of such Conventions as His Majesty’s Government adhere to. rut the States are not in fact legally bound in any way oy such conventions in the absence of specific adh^r^nce either by the Rulers themselves or by His Majesty’s Government on their behalf and with their authority. It is correct in these circumstances to say that the adherence of His Majesty s Government to an instrument such as the Arms Traffic Convention would not by itself impose any obligation on the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf# Persian rights of inspect io n_under tne Arms Traixic Convention of 1925# 4. The Political Resident advises us that in practice the dhows of all our Arab proteges in the Gulf almost invariablyinvariably fly some sort of flag, either the Trucial flag, a n white-red-halved flag” (cf.H.M#S. Hastings's letter No.965/25 of 6 th November 1931), or the flag of Bahrein, Qatar, Koweit or Musoat. On the assumption stated above that the adherence of His Majesty's Government to an Arms Traffic Convention would not by itself bind the Arab Rulers, the ships of those Rulers flying either the Trucial flag or the flag of Bahrein, Koweit, Muscat or Qatar, would fall outside Categories (a) and (b) in paragraph 1 of Annexe II, Section 2 Subsection 5 (page 54 of Cmd.3448 of 1929) of the Convention of 1925, and Persia would have no legal right of inspection of such vessels. We have not I fear in our recent discussions sufficiently appreciated that this was the case, and are grateful to the Admiralty for emphasizing it. 5 # We feel at the same time in the first place that the 1925 Convention as it stands is so loosely drawn that we might find it difficult in practice to mahe an effective protest against the search by a Persian vessel of an Arab dhow flying the flag of an Arab principality which was not a party to theConvention. Secondly, and this is the argument which has carried most weight with us, and which the Political Resident would probably, we think, endorse, there is the extreme difficulty as we see it ofmaking sure that Persia will not abuse any rights of inspection she may be given (particularly if they are n too precisely defined). They would probably not bo too scrupulous in suggesting that a dhow improperly searched them was in fact flying no flag, and we might find it , n /-, 4- + Vi o r* Existing* 4 * ■o no Existing ri^ts of inspect ion by Persia* 6 . Persia under the Muscat authority of 1898 referred to in paragraph 3 of the Arms Traffic Memorandum on p.151 of P*G.13 has rights of search of Muscat vessels on the high seas» If she showed any sign of realising that she had this right, we should probably think it necessary to advise the Sultan of Muscat to &lt;ancel the proclamation of 1898, and substitute for it an autnority confined to His Majesty’s Ships. (it will be necessary to consider carefully th 1 © question whether Muscat should or should not be advised to accede to any i^ , i!is--raxfic Convention which mi^it give Persia rights against ner ships - conditions have changed materially since 1919). Secondly, it seems possible in view of your letter, that she nay retain sone rights of inspection under the Brussels Act of 1890. Prima facie we are inclined to feel some doubt as to this, and it is perhaps not irrelevant first that she does not appear at any stage in the recent discussions to have claimed or referred to the possible existence of such rights, and second that the governing instrument as regards slavery is at present the Anglo-Persi an Convention of 1882, which is wholly one sided and confers rights of search of Persian vessels His Majesty's ships without conferring rights of of any kind on Persia. 7 . The position th^T^we accept your view that so long as the Arab principalities of the Gulf do no. themselves accede or authorise us to accede on their Ar-nq Traffic Convention behalf, to an instruacnt such as the r... trpqqpls fly a flag whi di is of 1925, and ao long as their it ^ p Persia appears to have no legal not the flag of anH.C.P., Persia ^ ■Mrm Such vessels under the Convention: right of inspection es SUC - A that/?/ that Persia in our view only very doubtfully possess any rights of inspect ion at the moment (and quite possibly none save in respect of Muscat vesselsytwhich could be withdrawn without delay if necessary): that we have been and are most reluctant to see her acquire any such rights: that subject to this point being V adequately safeguarded we have however no objection to the principle of special zones, and that prima facie we are inclined departmentally to think that subject to the point mentioned in paragraph 1 above, the latest Foreign Office proposals may afford a solution which while making it possible to maintain the principle of the special zones will equally safeguard the interests of our Arab prote&amp;S's. 7.

UAITHWAITE.&lt; . -w ; ' ^ \ A' • V V r\ &lt;L P.Z. 420 1933 Dear Laithwaite, You will remember that I spoke to you over the telephone a few weeks ago about the applicability of the provisions of the Arms Traffic Convention to British-protected Arab vessels flying their own flags upon the high seas. As I gather this matter is likely to come up at the meeting tomorrow I thought perhaps it might be worth while to unburden myself more fully. H*M. G-overnment has always maintained that the Trucial Arab states are (to quote P.G. 13) 'independently administered tribal principalities governed by independent Arab Sheikhs'. This being so, even although it is true their foreign relations are in our hands, one would not expect to find them bound by the signature of H*M. Government to a treaty unless this is specifically stated to be the case. Bahrein and Koweit seem to be on the same footing from this point of view ^ SENTagyt^ '•1 laithwaits. Esq. ? °- r FROM StCRETARY, Pi chiefs, and luispal i ^ avnn mm-p definitely ENCOSURE W WEFK'Y i’-tteR H SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICEindependent. All these states, including 1 the trucial chiefs, have their own distinctive flags. If the trucial chiefs were to be committed in this way I should have supposed it could only be done with their prior consent, as we should be acting only as their agents. Since I spoke to you over the telephone I have unearthed a telegram, of which a copy is attached, sent from the Foreign Office to Sir B. Clive in 1929. The question answered by the first paragraph was whether the Persian Government would be justified in assuming Arab dhows under British protection, but flying their own flags, to be the same as British ships for the purposes of a proposed bilateral Slavery Convention. If the Foreign Office view in 1929 was correct it seems to be clear that the right of * visiting Arabian dhows need not ( and probably would not ) be conveyed by the Convention to any of the Contracting Powers. This would leave us with our existing’ rights of examining such dhows unimpaired, and (apart from the moral/moral effect of retaining the special zones, to which we attach importance) the Convention would be valuable in sc iar as it would give us (in common with the other Contracting Powers) the right to examine vessels flying no flag at all, or flying the flag of one of the Convention Powers. lou will remember that before the tfar French vessels from Muscat gave us a lot of trouble. A possible me nod of notifying to the world in general that the Convention does not convey the right to search British protected Arab dhows would be by a suitable statement in Parliament (e.g. inspired question and answer), which need not, of course, particularise the Persians. The last paragraph of the attached 1929 telegram raises another issue, to wit, the powers the Persians already possess for interfering with native shipping in the Gkilf under cover of slavery. So far as I can ascertain there is no trace in Admiralty records of any further consideration of this matter in 19^9, but neverthless the Persians were party to the Brussels/Brussels Act of 1SSC (which gave all Con tracting Powers the right to visit and detain slavers in the Gulf), they were not party to the 15IS Contention which, as between the Contracting Powers, abrogated the Brussels Act. In these circumstances it would seem very caestionable how far an effective diplomatic protest could be made if a Persian gunboat interfered with an Arab dhow to search for slaves. Taking these two points together, it dees seem to me that, as things stand, the Persians could find excuse for interfering with British-protected Arab shipping in the Gulf, and that the risk would not be increased at all if the Convention were entered into, I am sending copies of this letter to Hendel of the Foreign Office, LcSweeney of the Colonial Office, Parker of the Board of Trade, Group Captain Pierse of the Air ianistry, and Colonel Hurray of the War Office.

Sir, With reference to previous correspondence regarding the proposed arrangements for the control of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and the question of the inclusion of those areas in the proposed special maritime zone, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you the accompanying copies of further telegraphic and semi-official correspondence with His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, together with a copy of a despatch which has been addressed to Mr. Hoare recording two conversations with Monsieur Sepahbodi, the Persian Minister in Switzerland. 2 . In view of the political considerations urged by Mr. Hoare, and of the importance which the Persian Government evidently attach to the matter, it is clearly desirable that every effort should be made to find a solution of the problem with the least possible delay. As a result of the interdepartmental discussions which have already taken place on the question Sir John Simon understands that although somewhat divergent views have been held by the various departments concerned as to their relative importance, the main desiderata of His Majesty 1 s Government may broadly speaking be described as follows, (a) that the general principle of the special zones should be maintained; (b) that His Majesty^ ships snould have the right to visit and control shipping under 500 tons on the high seas of the Persian TJnder Secretary of State ^dia Offi Ce# copy Sent by air mail OOPY SfcHT TO.Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, although His Majesty* s Government realise that it may well prove impossible for them to establish any legal right to visit vessels flying the Persian flag; (c) that Persia should not acquire any right to visit or control non-Persian vessels outside Persian territorial waters. It has occurred to Sir John Simon that these various objects might still be secured, and the views of the Persian Government still be met if a solution were now sought somewhat on the following lines. In the first place a bilateral agreement would be concluded between His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom and the Persian Government on the general lines of the Persian draft enclosed in Mr. Hoare’s despatch No* 478 of l?th November last, of which a copy was sent to you in Foreign Office letter No. E 6433/2529/34 of 20th January last. Many important modifications would of course be necessary in this draft, but its main feature insofar as His Majesty^ Government were concerned, would be a declaration by Persia that she neither claimed nor would claim in future, any right to visit or control non-Persian shipping outside Persian territorial waters, and that she would for her part, raise no objection to His Majesty’s ships exercising such control. This agreement could be followed up by a separate protocol, to be concluded at the same time as any other multilateral instrument on the question of the traffic and manufacture in arms resulting from the Disarmament Conference by which the signatory Powers would take note of the bilateral agreement already concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government,m one of them may be concerned with the provision regarding the right of visit and control by His Majesty’s snips of non-Persian shipping below a certain tonnage in the Persii Government&gt; and express their agreement insofar as each one of them may be concerned with the provision regarding the right of visit and control by His Majesty’s snips of as each non-Persian shipping below a certain tonnage in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. This would in effect amount to a recognition by the other Powers concerned of the sole Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. right of His Majesty's Government to exercise such control. By this means the Persian Government's main desiderata - i.e. exclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman from the special zone provided for in the main convention - would be secured, while the main desiderata of His Majesty’s Government, insofar as it appears practicable to secure them secure them, would be maintained. 4. In view of the urgency of the matter I am to suggest that the whole question should now be discussed at a very early date at an interdepartmental conference to be attended by representatives of your department. I am to propose that such a conference might suitably be held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, 27th April at 3.30 p.m. Similar letters are being addressed to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, War Office, Colonial Office and the Board of Trade.

Monaieur Cepahhsdi, who had coins to i/.mdon for sho spacicl purpose of dieousaing tlis question w^.th me 3 wbb aocompeaj.od by Hurl Kafajidlarl. 0^ Monsieur iiopahbodi began by expltdning that the i-ersi&amp;n 'iG^rorr^ont attached the utmost importaneo to thia matter.

Monsieur benehbodl then went on to explain that, apart from this practical question, Persian national prestige was seriously Involved. yhe Inclusion of an area in the special zone Inevitably carried with it an implication that area wan either imperfectly controlled, or eo unstable politically as to bo specially liable to fall Into a disturbed condition. uuch an Implication, besides being wholly unjustified, would be bitterly resented In Persia, and the inclusion of the dulfs In the special zone would therefore bo incompatible with Persian self respect. it would thus be Impossible for the iersian Government, even If they were to agree to sign a Convention containing such a provision, to secure Us approval by the Persian ilejlle; end, rather than subscribe to such an arrangement, X'ersia would be obliged to withdraw from the iiearmamont conference. The Persian Government were, however, most anxious to uvold any such withdrawal. They wished to co-operate whole- heartedly in the efforts of the conference, and would glse.ly become/y tt; •'* r-p^-r. 127 become g party to uny instrument resulting therefrom which did ^K)t Injure Persian prestige or run counter to Persian interests. Similarly B they r/ere -Ailly prepared to meet all legitimate British interests. it won felt at Geneva that the Powers mainly interested in the Persian Gulf were Persia ti nd Great j&amp;rioaln* und * on^leur Gepchhodi had aseertedned tliat the other Powers at Genova would he fully satisfied if Persia and this country could coiue to an agreement between themselves as regards the Gulf. Pons lour oep&amp;hbo&amp;i had therefore been Instructed by his Government to urge most strongly that the question should be dealt with by a bilateral agreement between Persia and this country, by which the rights of both parties could be fully protected. The Persian Government had already put forward, through hie Majesty*e Minister at Tehran, the draft of such an agreement (i«e» presumably that enclosed in your despatch no. 4?8 of November i?th lost), but they would be willing to consider any modifications which ilia Majesty's Oovex»nment in the United &lt;ingdom might wish to propose in that instrument. The Persian Government could not understand why, in those circumstances. His Majesty’s Government still appeared to attach so much importance to including the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of cman in the special provided for in the main multilateral convention. 5. I explained to Monsieur Sepahbodl in reply that liia Majesty 3 Government were animated by the friendliest feelings towards Persia and wor* anxious to work in the closest harmony wi oh her in these matters. 7e had every regard for Persian sovereignty. Territorial waters were excluded and the difflcu.ltio of i&gt;he ease v/ore due to geographical circiiaatancos, r ihe nntter was on® of much,'much uoninXexifcy tind thoro seeaea to bo considerable dlfficuXtlea In the way of the solution which he had ^ust ou^catod* bllaueral convention would no doubt ^jlve both co ^hlo country ii»od to iersla the epedflc righto which niight be nrovided for therein. Ho such instrument could, however^ ( j v j f, r, j . .or porty rig^its as against third parties© xt j was no doubt true that provision could bo made in such a bilateral convention for dealing with shins flying the flog of either party; but what would bo the position of chips .t.l e /..nt*, ohe of third parties? Rights of control over such ships could only be acouired by agreement with the third partxos concerned; c*nd it wao indeed mainly in order to provide for such eases that His xla^osty’e aovemment had wished to deal with the Gulfs in a multilateral Instrument. 6 « Konslour Uepahbodl then put fonward two alternative cutest Ions* 'Clio first was that a bilateral Anglo- fere 1 an agreeraont should be concluded to provide for the supervision should be invited to adhea?e thereto. Ho saw no objection to special arrangements being made to secure th© agreement of ‘^ACh other P®w©rs to the provielons of any /aiglo-Persian ^greeinent such as th© fereian Government had proposed, that the Gulfs were not; dealt with In a general convention together with disturbed or undeveloped areas In a way which Persia could only regard as incompatible with her prestige. Alternatively j Monsieur aepahbodi suggested that the Arabian side of the Gulf only should bo provided for In the general convention, special arrangements being made for the ^©rnlaji side.

My dear Randal, 1 tnfcroed our Perelan friend yesterday, in accordance *ith your letter S 1846/8U/34, 0 f the 14th instant, that nle propeeal for a bilateral agreeaent was not acceptable and would not permit us to acquiesce in the omission of the Persian Gulf and the oulf of Oman from the special tones. We subsequently made a brief statement of our respective positions In the Sub-Committee, the proceedings of which are reported in our Despatch No. i2i or yasterday. {I enclose an extract herewith). Riasi seemed very disappointed; and when 1 repeated that those were my Instructions, and that I did not eee any purpoae m my puraulng the diecuealcn with nia, he asked whether I thought it would be any good hie going to London to diecuee it with the authorities there. I did not encourage him, but i euspeet that he has telegraphed to Tehran suggesting tnat he should do so. You will see from the same despatch that we eubmittfc'd t' the Oub~Ccmmlttee the amendments required to secure the suppression of the pnraae 'native vessels'. For convenience of reference I enclose the text of these amendments. This morning Rlad, having studied them at leisure, came to me and made the following proposal: If wo would begin our new article 27a with the words: “The Eeq., C .m.O.of 'The provisions respecting aaritime supervis II) and the ?lying of tne~fT thie convention sion (Annex II eg then he would reeommend nls government to agree to the maintenance of the ronee, aa there would then be no recognition of any right to Interfere with Persian vessela (except for the purpose of verifying the flag) He begged me to consult you about this proposal, and I could not refuse to do so, though I held out no hopes tliet the result would be favourable. He assured me that this proposal would give u 8 , if not all we wanted, at any rate all that we could poasibly obtain under a convention which maintained the zones but wao not accepted by Persia. Ha-e no confidence in my ability to follow all 'he . ami float ions of this abstruse question. But his 1 est contention eeeme to me prims facie correct; end if so, it may not be easy to explsin to him - and etili less easy to explain to the committee - why we onnot accept it. till you let me know what to tell Riaci?

Carr's letter. ’,Ve shall no douht hear further In the near future from tne foreign Oil ice atout it and I will keep you informed of any developments. One of the principal difficulties is that in so far as any arrangement aPout arms traffic is of political or bargaining value in our negotiations with Persia we are not in the least anxious to show our hand or in any way to meet the Persians while general negotiations are suspended. Our list of assets is very small indeed and if we could, in the event of negotiations being resumed, turn to bargaining value our readiness to agree to the exclusion of the Persian Gull from the special zones as a concession to Persia and possibly to negotiate an independent bilateral arms traffic agreement of a satisfactory nature with her, this would pay us far better than making any concession now. On the other hand, negotiations are raost unlikely to be resumed before next Lay at earliest and it is quite conceivable tnat the delay may be very considerably longer. We may, therefore, if there is any/213 any prospect Ox early progress in the Disarniainent Conference, have to show our hands rather earlier tnan we should like. But on general grounus I should be disposed (and I think the Foreign Office would agree) to go very slow at the moment/and merely play for delay on the lines contemplated in the instructions ^ent to kr. Carr. You may care to see the text of the instructions sent to him (P.Z.127Q) and also the Foreign Office letter to kr. Ho are at Tehran of 18 th January, to which reference is made by kr. Carr (P.Z.428/33). /&lt;*! tfejO oaft &gt;Cvy^YyvtlTet ife Geneva. 6 th March, 1933. My dear Rendel, I have received Warner's letter, E .1094/211/34 of the 28th February, and your letter E . 1147 / 211/34 of the 3rd instant, about the special zones. The enclosures contained in the former letter, and an interview which I have had today with the Persian delegate, have led me to a rather new train of thought; and I wonder whether, in view of more recent discussions (and in particular of the divergence of opinion between the Foreign Office and the India Office on the one hand, and the Admiralty on the other), the policy announced in your letter of January 18th to Rex Hoare is still applicable in its entirety. The instructions which I have received have one merit: they are not difficult to carry out. I fail to see that they have any other. They seem to me to represent not a policy, but a confession of inability to -ind a policy: for they consist in telling me to advocate somethingsomething which we know to be unattainable, and of which the attainment (if it could be realised) would, in view of the Foreign Office and the India Office, be very embarrassing to us. It is, you must admit a somewhat lame and impotent conclusion. When, therefore, I came to look into the Persian proposal of November last, it did occur to me that this proposal might provide us with a more satisfactory way out So far as I can see we might, if we availed ourselves of thi8 Proposal, arrive at a position where we have obtained the Admiralty objective of nutting on an indisputable legal basis the right of control which we claim to exercise in the Persian Gulf, and at the same time avoid the embarrassments foreseen by you and the India Office if the Persian Government were given rights of control over non-Persian ships. The objections to this proposal which you make in your letter to Hoare of January 18th are two: first, you suggest that, in view of the change of government in ersia, a method of direct negotiation may no longer be a PPropriate; and second, that direct negotations are not a Ppropriate so long as a general Convention is under discussion at Geneva. The first objection is, of course, beyond2U&amp; beyond my province. I can only say that the Persian delegate has assured me in the most formal and emphatic manner that the Persian Government maintains the proposal which it made in November last, and that subsequent changes have not in any way affected its attitude on this question. As regards the second objection, I can speak with confidence. There is no objection whatever from the Geneva standpoint to our settling this matter by a bi-lateral agreement with Persia. The other delegations are completely disinterested. If the matter comes up for discussion in the Committee, those who wish to be agreeable ^o us will take our side; those who feel otherwise, or think that this is another case of Great Britain browbeating a small Power, will take the field against us; and those tfho are actuated by neither motive will simply abstain. ^he third category will be by far the largest; and every member of the Committee will be delighted if we are able to announce that we have reached an agreement with Persia on the regime to be applied in the Persian Gulf and are therefore able to propose the removal of that area from the special zones defined in the 1925 Convention. I emphasise this point, because in nearly all the papers on the subject itit seems to be assumed by the Foreign Office that there is some objection here to dealing with the matter by bi-lateral discussions with the Persians. This is in no sense whatever the case. Perhaps then you will consider the matter further in the light of these observations and let me know whether you cannot authorise me to discuss the question privately I with my Persian colleague on the basis of the Persian draft. It will not be difficult to dispose of the minor objections Wxiich rioare raises in his despatch. f A , V s regards Article 3, I presume the Persians will maintain their theoretical standpoint about territorial waters, just as we maintain ours. But a solution can be found by omitting any definition of territorial waters from the draft, and dealing with individual cases of dispute as t ley arise (which is presumably what we should have to do now). Article 4 can obviously not stand in precisely its present form; but there will be no need to include it at all if we reach an understanding to agree on both sides to the omission of the Persian Gulf from the special zones, as defined in the definitive Convention which will replace the Convention of 1925. The only vital question - and the one ■v^ich you must decide - is whether Articles 1 and 2 suffice put our existing practice on a legal basis without exposingV- 2lg V ‘ ^ exposing us to an 3 ^ countervailing disadvantages. In any case I do not see that we can lose anything by exploring a solution on these lines, since if it fails, we .can always return to our insistence on the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the zones. Will you let me know as soon as possible what you think? I might add that the Persian delegate reaffirmed once more his objections to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the zones. I suggested that perhaps the real trouble arose from the definition of 'native ships”, which we were perfectly prepared to alter, but he was not prepared to admit that this helped him at all. He said that the exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the zones was a question of moral — i satisfaction for the Persian Government, and he did not give any hope that they would sign any Convention which did not give them this essential point.

The Sub-Committee on the manufacture of and ^raffle in Arms of the Disarmament Conference v/as to consider during the T veek beginning on March 6 th with a view to the preparation of its report to the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference, the question whether the Conference should be recommended to adopt a special zones regime* on the lines of that contemplated in the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925. The present interdepartmental meeting was required to decide upon the attitude to be a dopted on this point by Mr. Carr, the United Kingdom representative...221 representative on the Sut-Cornniittee. The Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned appeared to he agreed that Mr. Carr should be instructed to press for the adoption of the special zones regime. But there was a difference of view between the Departments interested regarding the question of the inclusion or exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the special maritime zone. If the regime were adopted, if the Persian Gulf were in cluded in the maritime zone, and if Persia were a party to the agreement in which this was embodied, she would acquire the right of interfering with Arab and Indian shipping in the Gulf. A further point for consideration by the meeting was what instructions should be sent to Mr. Carr regarding the attitude to be adopted supposing that a majority of the other countries concerned objected either to the zones regime in general, or to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in particular. It was understood from Mr. Carr that there was in general little support to be had for the zones regime, and it was quite possible that the Persians might obtain sufficient sympathy to secure a majority against its adoption, or at least against the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in it. GrcOUP-CAPTaIN PEIHSE explained that the interest of the Air Ministry in this question was entirely practical, and was based on their responsibilities in connexion Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan. They wished to see no legislation.....■ 221 3. legislation introduced which would weaken control over the arms traffic in the neighbouring countries in Arabia, the .Red Sea or the Persian and tney would, welcome any strengthening of such control,, They were therefore strongly in favour of retaining the principle of special zones. Such control however, to be effective must be general, and they considered that it would be most unwise to exclude the Persian Gulf from the special zones. The ADMIRALTY representatives suggested that Mr. Carr might defend the maintenance of the zones regime against any general opposition by pointing out that His Majesty’s Government had done their best to assist in devising an efficient system of arms control; that the results had been embodied in the 1925 Convention, and that it was absurd now to demand the abolition of that system. The Admiralty would prefer to oppose to the last any proposal to do away with the zones; and they would be prepared, if the worst came to the worst, to make a reservation in regard to the zones when the report on the arms traffic was sent in to the Bureau of the Conference. MR. RENDEL observed that there were two main diffi culties. First, how to meet any general opposition to the special zones rdgime, and secondly, how to meet the difficulty arising from the possibility that the adoption of the rdgime, with the inclusion of the Persian Gulf, might give Persia the right to interfere with Arab shippingspec ial * a o o o shipping in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. As regards the first point he saw no reason why the British representative should not be instructed to fight to the \ last for the retention of the general principle of the zones* As regards the second point the Foreign Office were inclined to agree with the India Office that, if ft^sia were likely to ootain the right of interference with native shipping t it might he more advantageous to exclude the Persian Gulf from the zones. MR, LAIiHWATTE stated that the India Office could not agree to insistence on the special zones principle or at any rate to Inelstence on the inclusion of the Persian Gulf In the zones if that Insistence were likely to lead to Persia obtaining the rights in question. In the view of the India Office, the political risks involved in the acceptance of any such arrangement were so serious as to outweigh any considerations on the other side. On that point they were unable to go beyond the views expressed In their official letter of the 23rd February to the Foreign Office. A general discussion then followed in which the following points arose:- (D the present indications were that Persia would ^ere to her previous attitude and would refuse to be- come a party to any arrangement which provided for the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the special maritime z °ne„ But there was no guarantee that she would not change her mind during discussions at Geneva. Further if the224 special zone regime in its present form were adopted ty the Conference with Persia abstaining, she would be at liberty presumably to accept it at any time subse quently, The Persian representatives had recently en quired the views of His Majesty’s Government on the proposal for a bilateral agreement between the two countries, which Teymourtache had communicated to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran last year. It was con- sidered by the meeting that although there were cer tain attactions in such an agreement, it provided no escape from the present difficulty e since it would be no security against Persia later acceding to the $jn~ vention if she found it more to her advantage to do so, and against her thus obtaining the rights, which it was desired she should not have 0 Since, therefore, there appeared to be no guarantee in any case against Persia’s deciding at some stage to accede to the Convention, it appeared that it would be impossible to secure the in clusion of the Persian Gulf in the zones v/ithout run ning the serious risks which the India Office feared, ( 2 ) It was realised that two different advantages, which His Majesty's Government hoped to preserve, were being weighed against each other. There was on the one hand the desire of the political Departments to maintain the influence of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf, and on the other the desire of the Service Depart ments to control the arms traffic danger in that region. With regard to the first of these, it was pointed out that His Majesty’s Government had not only their treaty ob ligations with the sheikhs of the Persian Gulf to consider**consider, tout also oil and air interests which relied ^ore for protection on the prestige of His Majesty’s Government than on any armed or financial assistance which could toe afforded them. Further, the danger of the arms traffic was not at present considered toy the Government of India to toe serious. The Air Ministry, on the other hand, pointed out that they had to take into consideration the possible collapse of the central authorities in certain of the countries bordering on the Gulf, and the consequent infiltration of arms into territories from which they could toe used against Palestine and Transjordan. MR. RENDEL was inclined to favour the proposal that as the Convention was still in the committee stage and its future was uncertain, His Majesty’s Government might take the risk of the Persians changing their rninds^ should authorise the United Kingdom representative to press for the zones principle in general, and should aim at including the Persian Gulf in the zones, unless the Persians appeared likely to alter their attitude or to obtain a majority in favour of their point oi view. In either of these cases Mr. Carr should refer home for further instructions. This would not however meet the danger of Persia’s making a reservation now regarding the inclusion of the Persian Gulf, tout later withdrawing it and acceding to any arrangement made and so acquiring the right of interference with Arab shipping. THEAil/iIRALTY representatives then suggested that the actual geographical definition of the zones might perhaps...f A * 1 ■a TT I'T 226 f; /a 7. perhaps be postponed. The special regime could be adopted in principe; there was no need to settle its details at once, though discussion might be conducted on the basis of the zones as fixed in 1925. I MR ’ yarded the suggestion as very hopeful and observed that, although it did not entirely remove I . the difficulty of a possible Persian accession to the Convention, it would leave that difficulty to be dealt with at a later stage when the Persian attitude might have become clearer. M3. lAlTHIVAITE also concurred in the suggestion, adding that it was understood that the Persians would in any case have no legal right to exercise any privil- i eges they ml 5 ht secure under the Convention until the latter had taken definite shaped M3. MA3KE3 also concurred, though with the reservation that the Board of Trade were strongly opposed to any wide extension of the zones. A newly arrived telegram from Geneva was then read to the meeting stating that the arms traffic question was to come up for discussion on the following diy . -he 3rd Marsh, Telegraphic instructions were at once drafted and concurred in by the meeting for despatch to Mr. &amp;arr: a copy of the text of these instructions is attached to this record.

On the other hand, (l) Persia at the 1925 Conference, and consistently since, has opposed the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the maritime zone mainly from consideration of amour j&gt;ropre and from unwillingness to agree to the provision, in virtue of which her shipping of below 500 tons would be liable to supervision on the high seas of the Persian Gulf by warships of other nations (i*e« His Majesty's ships); and, so far as it has been possible to estimate, she may be able to secure support in advocating the exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the zoneo ( 2 ) Persia having now acquired some small warships would,* 233 would,, supposing she by chance, now or later, changed her attitude and acquiesced in the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the special maritime zone* acquire the same right of supervision over vessels under 500 tons belonging to the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, which are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. Some 8pprePension is felt as the possible consequences of the acquisition of such rights by Persia; although the amount of interference allowed under the terms of the 1925 oonvenuion -io limited- jtt mAght well be that the Persian navy would use the opportunity to interfere with Arab shipping to ait extent that would be vexatious and dangerous, and also extremely damaging to the prestige of His Majesty’s Government.

The prevention of the Illicit traffic in arms is obviously in line with the general pima 0 f the Disarmament Conference. In previous international discussion of the question it has always been recog nised on historical grounds that the area of the world covered by the special regime provided for in Chapter III of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 is one in which, owing to fiS? geographical and poli tical conditions, special measures are necessary. The matter was the subject of the most careful and prolonged consideration in connexion with the after war international settlements, and as a result the Arms Traffic Convention of St. Germain-en-haye was drawn up in 1919. Various difficulties in the way of the putting into force of this convention led to its reconsideration and resulted, again after the most careful examination of the questions at issue, in the drawing up of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1)25. His Majesty's Govemment see no reason to revise the opinion on wnich tne inclusion in these Conventions of a special regime for tiaft. area in,, quest A was baaed. So far as territories in that area under their control or protection are concerned, they still feel as they did in 1925, that the adoption of the special regime designed to prevent the manufacture, tradetrade in and transportation of arms except under State supervision would be highly beneficial; and they still feel that it would be an essential part of such a regime that the warships of thelH^l— Contracting Powns should be entrusted with powers to check the smuggling of arms in small vessels which - a matt er o f historical fact - ia^liable to take place in the area \n ^ 2. Incidentally, the question of the illicit arms traffic by sea in this area is not unconnected with that of the Slave traffic and His Majesty’s Government consider that the measures for the maritime supervision of the illicit arms traffic provided for in Chapter III and Annex II of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 would if adopted be found of assistance in the suppression of the Slave trade, ^ 3. The territories covered by the special land zone of the 1925 Convention are mainly under some form or other of tutelage; but in the case ol independent States within the special land zone (such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia),the Governments of which might from reasons of hrouif prQP£&amp; object to the inclusion of their territory in the special zone, Article 28 of the 1925 Convention provides a manner of meeting such objections. Under this article a State can secure the exclusion of its territory from the special land zone by assuming ut the time of accession in the ^exercise oi its sovereign rights the — Chapter III of the Convention.&gt;0 * 1*^ r' ' 4 24 ’5.

Notably the Government of India find themselves unable to accept the iziclusion of Indian vessels under this heading and the Persian Government have also raised objections on this point among others. His Majesty's Government therefore desire to suggest a modification of the provisions of the 1925 Convention on this point, viz. that the special category of native vessels should be abolished and that the power of maritime supervision should be extended within the special zones to all vessels under 500, or possibly 400 tons, net. A note prepared by the Board of Trade on a necessary consequential amendment to the Chapter III of the Convention is attached hereto (Airnex I). Persian Gulf. In considering the desirability from the point of view of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of the inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the special maritime zone (as contemplated in the 1925 Convention) conflicting considerations arise. (1) that the Persian Gulf has in the past been one of the main areas of the illicit traffic in arms, and that in connexion with previous conferences for the consideration of the arms traffic question it has always been considered an area for special treatment; ( 2 ) that, though at the moment there may be 1 ittl 6 •••w —W' V, ■ k, » f’^f^ lit&gt;tle smuggling of, amis across fbe Persian Gulf «v ; ’ CaSK *aa 0CCW ^ J | » * f would ^r«uf 6%** 3 weakening ctf(1OTri5^1lral authorit; at once lead to its recrudescence; ^ UnA, (o) tjliao a j a l lie renunciation ^ItGeneva of tde principle of special control in the Persian Gulf would *v ft* •&gt;» &lt;ii»M destroy the impression prevalent locally that His Maj eB tyhavf special ri^its/to take^T^asures for the suppressiorT of the’ Tllicit arms traffic in the Pe«s4a» Gulf inapgftaaioja^4&gt;ai^A uaage, -not on any—sn i ^Gtjveranient caii now claim, but none the 1 -ess a 4eterr#nt-W-the aym o—t r )ir j^ li i_^C • the other hand, ( 1 ) Persia at the 1925 Conference, and consistently since, has opposed the inclusion of the Persian Gulf naSartS* r^uiwe, mainly from considerations of amour proore and from unwillingness to agree to the provision, in virtue of which her shipping of below 500 tons would be liable to i4f»r seme |o.n the hi^i seas of the Persian Gulf by warships of other nations (i.e. H.M. ships); and, so far as it has been possible to estimate, she may be able to secure c.ousSera.b-ie support in advocat- ing the exclusion of the Persian Gul^^ (2) Persia having now acquired some small warships would, suppos ing she by chance, now or later, changed her attitude and acquiesced in the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in •/ rvfjAVM ^ the special maritime zone, acquire the/Tight &lt;tsr ' ~ inspect vessels under 500 tons belonging to the arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, wnich are -unite/ to/;.

But if, contrary to expectation, there are inuications that the Persian representatives may acqiiesce in any arrangement the effect of which would be to give the Persian navy the right of inspection of Arab vessels in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom must not be committed to the acceptance of such an arrangement without further consideration of the matter. In the event, also, of a general measure of opposition to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the maritime zone developing, further instructions should be sought. 7 6 . It is understood that the proposal may be made that the special zones, referred to in Chapter 3 of the Convention should be extended to cover the whole world. The applica tion to the United Kingdom of the regime governing the special land zones would involve inter alia , in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 and Annex 2, Section 1, paragraph 3, tne abolition of the private manufacture of arms. Instructions have already been issued to the United Kingdom Delegation to oppose any proposal in favour of the abolition of private manufacture and the reasons set out in these earlier instructions may be used to oppose the present proposal to extend the special zones. A Cabinet decision has already been taken that 'No advantage 'should be allowed to countries relying on States as 'opposed to private manufacture'. 7 . The proposal to extend the maritime zones universally is equally unacceptable. The Board of Trade consider that,if the majority of the Powers represented on the Committee, particularly the Great Powers, can be persuaded to realise that the proposal would involve giving the riidit of searching their ships, even though below a certain tonnage, to the warships of other Hi$i Contracting Parties, the suggestion would find little support. o. a general objection against the proposed extension of the special zone regime to the whole world might be made on the following lines. The amount of the illicit traffic in arms in most of the world is, so far as can be ascertained, so small as to render it unnecessary to attempt to surmount the many and various practical difficulties which would be involved. In thearea of the contemplated special zones, however, the illicit arms traffic has, owing to the political and geographical conditions, been in the past of considerable and dangerous dimensions. It was found possible in 1925 to devise a special system of control for this area, which took account of the practical necessities of the case. An attempt to make this system appreciable to the rest of the world would undoubtedly involve a radical change in its character and would necessitate the redrafting of Chapter III of the Convention of 1925 throughout, - if indeed it proved practicable at all.242 c g P z. o.’jiCii, iisi'oh, 1933« My dear Victor, rt e hare Juat received, our InstroctionE fro® above ae to the line we are to take, at the meeting which 1. now xlxed xor 3.30 tomorrow here, on the cuestlon of the inclusion or exclusion of the rersian Oulf from the special 2 .one. 2.

Your proposal is that Carr should be instructed to press for the adoption of the special s&amp;one system including the Persian Gulf in the special maritime a one, and to refer bacjc for instructions if unexpectedly the Persian delegates seem likely to acquiesce. Our criticism of this is two-fold. (a) That, supposing the Persians do change their attitude, it rill make our volte faos on the question of the inclusion of the Persian Gulf, which is in any case going to be awkward, much more awkward, if our delegation h ve to demand the breaking off of the discussion in the committee while they await further instructions. On the other hand, there is no chance, we under stand, of either the India Office or ourselves giving way as to the necessity of denyin, the Persians the opportunity of inter fering with iiTab shipping and therefore as to the necessity Ox excluding the Persian Gulf, supposing the rersi;ms were prepared to accept its inclusion. If X.O. and f.G. are not prepared to give way there seems no point in deferring a decision on the matter, as suggested in the Admiralty letter of 4th Pebrmary, and it would be very much more convenient 1.0 inform oui deiegat^ 01 ® at • • •mmmmq ■ 2So at once of tho attltaSo to be talcen up if the Persians do seem likely to accept the inclueion of the Persian Gulf in the maritir.e zone.

The Admiralty comment on the proceedings of the meeting is contained in their letter of 4th February on P.Z.746/33. 3o far as tne Political Department point is concerned, viz. the Persian Gulf zone, they still consider that the risks of possible abuse of the ri^ht of inspection by the Persians are not substantial, and express the hope that we will abandon our point. But their arguments are not very convincing and this Department remains of the opinion that we should support the view cf the 1212 5CC0 9.32 Government/4. Section I para. 3) and 18. The effect would be among other things to abolish the private manufacture of arms in the territories of the Partiq (Art. 17). Possibly the ir/fentien is to extend to the whole world only the provisions relating to the maritime zones. This would apply inter alia Jte ^ ^ * provisions Annex II Section II para. 5 to all vessels below 500 (400) tons in all waters and, if the amendment (which would still be necessary) were made to meet Indian difficulty about ^authorisation to fly the flag”, no Indian (or presumably British) ship below that tonnage could put to sea without a licence subject to the condition in Annex II Section II paras. 3 and 4.-^ C I imagine this is quite impracticable and would be strongly objected to by India. I should think it would suffice to say that as regards the proposal to extend the special zones provisions to the whole world (which would appear to involve a radical change in the character of the Convention and its redrafting throughout) the Secretary of state agrees generally with the Admiralty and would prefer not to express any detailed views until he knows how other Departments of His Majesty's Government regard it. t J U.

Sir, 23 FEB 1953 I am directed* by the 3/3 tor I. to say that he has had under his ~ &lt; | consideration the proceedings of the meeting held at the F.O. on 20th January to consider the question of including provision for special zones in the Disarmament Convention, together with the remarks thereon of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty contained in Admiralty letter to the F.O. No.A.. 0243/33 aated 4th February. 2. The 3/3 fully appreciates the weight of the arguments advanced by the L.C. of the Admiralty, end the reasons which lead them to desire the retention of the special zone regime in the Persian Gulf. But in the light of the correspondence which has passed with the G.of I. and the Political Resident, and on a review of the history of tnis question and of the situation as a whole, he is still of opinion that the political risks involved in acceptance of any arrangement the effect of v\ hich would be to give Persian ships the right to search ^rab dhows in the Gulf -TT are serious/te-die' iinuertatran. 3/5 . On the other hand there seems at any rate a fair-.probability that the Persians will not themselves oe prepared to acceae to any instrument which classifies the Gulf as a special zone, in which case there would be no question of their acquiring rights of inspection which might be abused, and in these circumstances the 3/3 would see no objection to H.L.G.’s representative at Geneva being instructed in the first instance, at any rate, to press for the retention of special zones everywhere, so long as it was clearly understood that he should not, without' specific instructions to that effect from H.L.G., commi : himself to the acceptance of any arrangement the effect of which would be to give the Persian Government rights of inspection of ^rab dhows in the Persian Gulf. As regards the proposal to extend trie special zones provisions of the 1935 Convention to the whole world (which would appear to involve a radical change in the character of one Convention ana to necessitate its redrafting throughout) fe* th^TS^ ^ agreed generally with the L.C. of the iiamiralty^iad would prefer^Eo postpone a detailed^Assion of his! views/2£&gt;S Department. views until He^in poss^i^n of con^en^a^of the ofiier interested Departt^Hs of Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, C.O., VI.0. and Board of Trade. J. G. LAITHWAITE2&amp;2 tte aainUnuxioa of social zones, and that though other Departaents hold no strong opinion, there is general agreefaent that the British representative on the ieneva Jocmttse should press for the adoption, in principle, of the special zone ro^lae in the Bisaraaaent Conveotion. 5# There ore t*o special questions which arise, both concerning’ the Persian Gulf, Gn the one hand it is ecu landed that Persia, Iraq and Saudi Arabia would refuse to accede to that pert of the Convention dealing with arms traffic, with the result that H*i • Ships could not inspect their shipping* On the other hand, it is contended that if Persia does accede, she will acquire the right to inspect Arab dhows fceltnglng to the Trucial Sheikha, and the Government of India, the India Office and the foreign Office agree in thinking that this right will be abused # Are we therefore to agree to the exclusion of the Persian Gulf frof* the special zones, or to prase for its inclusion except in the improbable event of iarsia indicating a readiness to sign the Convention? 6* In regard to the first of these two questions, if it could be considered without relation to the second, it still appears to Their ^rdships that the balance of advantage lies in pressing for the inclusion of the Gulf inr.' •* r ^ ’ ^-rrrxT r'i in the spaoial xonas* could muice play at 'Mtura with the fact that thxe is a practical, tbou;jh wodest, proposal for the control of the trailic in aras f which traffic is sti Taatisod by a lam body of opinion at Genova as particularly odiou8 f in areas whore such traffic is raost likely to occur, and we could claim the support oi those who are pressin ^ for ^orc visionary, an i indue; fan last ic, niothods ox control# 7. My Lords are not convinced that in such a case the Persian Government will necessarily receive supjort at /dneva in opposition to the principle of zones, and if. tuir respect they do not share t © fears of Vw jovernmont 01 India. Our object at { jaeva would be to anieavwui U obtain as rauch support as we can with a view to ensuring that the principle oi the zones should oe embocued in the Disarmament Convention. This course would have thi advanta.ee oi ttaintaioing the principle oi mantir e supervis» and would, in Their ^ordehiprf opinion, Lvjv* a cotter sition in th« Gull, a^on il certain bordering states did not sim the Convention, th,m wo should ba in it the principle were abandoned# 8.

S. as regards the Becone question raises, My Lords are under no illusion ao to t* 1 e possibility of rersian interforonco with shipping. Nevertheless they are in doubt whether the Convention, with its very guarded provisions for control, offers any Teat opportunity which can dq seize t upon by Persia as an excuse for such interference. It appears to Their Lordships that. Convention or no Convention, we may have to face the possibility of trouble now that Persia has a Navy* The incident at Tanb occurred although Persia was a forty to no agreloent allcwing her to examine Trab dhows for wugrled goods elsewhere th^m in territorial waters.

In this connection Py jords desire ne to s^y that .....tfa.t th»y would undoubtedly hava prafarrod a ConventioD ^riviii; to H.M* Ships the right oi search, but They real iso that if such a right ^are conforrod by thy Conyontion, its exercise oy rersia would afford that country acre opportunity for cuusia; trouole, ani therefore they do not wish to press for the adoption of the proposal* 11, My l&gt;ords hope that in those circuastaDcefi the Pepartmonts concerned will be able to waive their objection to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf fbo epecial zones* 1&lt;2* My Lords understand that it is tno view oi l;:3 torsi gn Office that it is alaost certain that Persia will refuse to si to the Convention, and in that case the question of a bi-lateral treaty tfifh Persia, as sirprostod by the ^ovornment of India, cjuld oa further ( 50 QBidored* It appears to Their Lordships that there would be «ore hope of concluding an u^Teenjent which would asot oai^ mqui xesent with the ersians if the principle of mariti w zones were , definitely embodied as a part of the Pisaraaraant vOnvention oven thouc^h Persia had not ratified that Convention. 13.

As, ho.vover, the contingency of Persia agreeing to the Convention is considered to be so remote, i:y Lords suggest that it is not necessary to give this matter further consideration at the present time. 14. Their Lordships are askeri for an opinion on the roposal to extern the special zones provision to too whoie or Id. They share the opinion of the Foard oi Rraio t at f this were done, undesirable complications might result, 'hey do not consider that any adequate grounds exist icr inch an extension of the sjstem, and they do not think that ho proposal merits serious consideration. they trust that &gt;ur representatives at deneva will have suliioient inlluence :o enable them successfully to resist any such proposal. 15.

Special zones ar© cQrtain mar it ini© and continent®,! areas within which, under the provisions of tne abortive Arms Traffic Convention of 1919 and the unratified Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, the High Contracting Parties undertake to prohibit, save under the most stringent restrictions, the importation and (in the case of the maritime zones) the transport of specified arms and ammunition In the case of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, the relevant provisions are contained in Chapter III, Articles 12 to 27. 2. It will be seen from Chapter III, Article 12, sections 1 and 2, that the land zones cover (a) the whole of Africa(except Egypt, Libia, Tunisia, Algeria, the Spanish possessions in North Africa, Abyssinia, tne Union of South Africa (with its mandated territory) and Southern Rhodesia), together with adjacent islands situated within 100 marine miles from the coasts ofthe territories in question, and also Princes Island in the Bight of Biafra, St. Thomas, Annobon and Soootra, but not the Spanish islands situated to the north of the parallel of 26 degrees north latitude; and (b) the Arabian peninsula, Gwadar, Syria and Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan, and Iraq. 3. The maritime zone includes the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and is bounded by a line drawn from and following tin latitude of Ca^pe Guardafui to the point of intersection with longitude 57 degrees east of Greenwich and proceeding thence direct to the point at which the eastern frontier of Gwadar meets the sea. 4* The 1925 Convention (following thus the Convention of 1919) provides tnat within the special zones no native vessel of less than 500 tons net tonnage shall be allowed toship, discharge, or tranship specified arms, ammunitions and implements of war. The definition of a native vessel is one either owned, fitted-out, or commanded by a native of any country bordering on the Indian Ocean west of the meridian 95 degrees east of G-reenwich and north of the oarallel of 11 degrees south longitude, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, or the Gulf of Oman, or if at least half the crew are natives of such countries. 5. The question is of special interest to India from two points of view: - (a) the purely Indian; (b) in so far as she is politically responsible for the Persian Gulft I. The Indian aspect . 6. As regards the purely Indian aspect, the effect the previsions quoted above is, as will be seen, to discriminate against Indian and Burman ships, all of which fall within the category of native vessels. The Government of India have consistently taken the strongest exception to this discrimination (and have intimated that they are unwilling to accede to theConvention unless and until that discrimination is removed). 7. The Indian objection to the provisions regarding Native Ships is twofold. (1) Any sort of regime discriminating against ’’native ships” (as defined above) is regarded as an affront to the dignity of India. The discrimination is of course not against Indian ships alone but against those of India and a number of other countries near uhe Special Maritime Zone, but tais does not v/eaken the objection Ox the Government of India to the discrimination. It has been suggested/,9V ■' ' T 275 ' suggested that the fact of the ships discriminated against being entitled 'native ships' is an aggravation of the affront, but it is hard to maintain this argument as the term 'native ships' is in common use and used by the Government of India, e.g. in their Trade Returns. (2) There are certain practical difficulties in the my of enforcing the provisions of the Convention in regard to native ships so far as India is concerned: (a) Under Article 22 oi the Convention 'native vessels' ii of less tnan 500 tons must obtain a written authorisation to fly the flag of a Hiah Contractina: Party and such authorisation may only'be granted under specified conditions. But under Sections 73 and 74 of the British Merchant Shipping Act 1894 a British Merchant Ship (which term includes ships registered in India) is bound to hoist its oroper national colours on certain occasions, and the Government of India consider tuat legislation in the United Kingdom would be necessary in order to give' effect to Article 22 of the Convention. The Board of Trade on theother hand have expressed the view that it would be possible to deal with this without such legislation. For a better understanding of the difficulties involved reference may be made to the attached copy of correwpondence. (b) Under Article 21 all 'native vessels' (apparently without any tonnage limit of any sort) are required to carry manifests when in the Special zone. A number of Lascar Ships owned by important Companies and managed by reputable Agents which- though probably all.above 500 tons - fall within the definition of native. vessels are at present exempt from the necessity of carrying manifests and the cancellation of this exempt ion' would involve very considerable inconvenience and expense to the Companies concerned. On this point also further information can be gathered from the attached copy of correspondence. 8. It is understood that the British Government hope to be able to meet the above objections of the Oovsmment of India by getting a Sub-Committee now sitting at Geneva to accept a re-draft of the relative provisions of the Convention under which (1) the Special regime will be applied to all snips of a tonnage of less than 50u (probably 400), not 'native' ships only, (2) nothing in the Special regime will apply to any ship over 500 tons, and (3) the wordirg of Article 22 will be amended so that Contracting''Zllo Contracting Party to fly the flag of such High Contracting Party will nave to be provided with a document authorising them to be in the Special Zone instead of with a document authorising tnem to fly the flag of a High Contracting Party, 9. If the British proposals for amendment of the Convention are met with camter-proposals from foreign representatives of the Sub-Committee, the British representative may be expected to confer with thelndian Delegation to the Disarmament Conference as to the acceptability of the Foreign amendments from thepoint of view of India. 10. The idea of a special regime for 'native vessels' in a Special Zone is borrowed, as will be seen from the attached correspondence, from the G-eneral Act of the Brussels Conference of 1890, which has been ratified by the G-overn ent of India. But this fact does not justify the inference that the attitude of the Government of India in regard to the present Convention is unreasonable, firstly because the ideas of 1932 are not those of 1390 in regard to such matters and secondly because owing to differences in the definition of 'native vessels' and of the Special Zone no Indian shins other than coasting craft based on Aden are affected by the G-eneral Act of the Brussels Conference. II. The Persian Gulf. 11. The history of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf and of the question of the special zones in relation to that area is described in the Political Department memorandum B.410, of which copies are attached. For reasons very similar to those actuating the Government of India in respect of Indian ships and waters, the Persian Govern:vent have hitherto steadfastly refused to accede to the Convention. They stror^ly resent the classification of the/the Persian Gulf as a special maritime zone and the discrimination against Persian vessels involved in the 1925 Convention in its present form. 12. From the British point of view the non-accession of Persia has in the past been a matter of less importance, for she has had no naval forces and even if willing could in practice have done little to carry out the obligations incumbent on her under the Convention. The situation is, however, now changed, for not only is the Central Government in Persia at the moment in effective control of the country as a wnole, but she has purchased certain naval units from Italy and has in addtion acquired armed preventive launches. 13. But the position is complicated from our point of view by the fact that Persia, were she to accede to a Convention of the nature of the 1925 Convention, would acquire a right of inspecting the dhows of our Arab proteges in the Persian Gulf. There is general agreement that she would abuse any such right if granted to her and in these circumstances the Resident in the Persian Culf and the Government of India, with whom the India as at present advised, Office and/the Kreign Office agree, consider that if there is any risk of Persia acceding to theConvention and if the special zones are retained tnen we must press for the exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the special zone regime The risks of any substantial increase in the arms traffic in this area are so far as can be judged at the present time small. The Central Government of Persia, for its own reasons, is anxious to keep any such traffic under the most stringent control, while theNorth West frontier is saturated with arms and ammunition and likely to remain so for some time to come. On the other hand, the political dargers involved in the .grant of a right of inspection/278 inspection of Arab dhows are real and immediate, and on a balance of advantage are thought by the political departments concerned to outweigh the disadvantages of excluding thepersian Gulf from the special zone. In these circumstances the British representative on the Manufacture of Arms Sub-Committee which is at present dealing with the question is not unlikely to be instructed to direct his tactics by those of the Persians - in other words, so long as the Persians refuse to sign any Convention under which the Persian Gulf would be classified as a Special Zone, to press for the retention of all existing special zones, but if and when the Persians show signs of acquiescirg in such classification, to press for the exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the regime. 3?

IN my telegram No. 182 of the 11th November last, I mentioned that the Minister of Court had communicated to me a draft arms traffic convention at the interview which I had with him on the 10th November, and I expressed the opinion that the fact that his Highness should have gone to the trouble to prepare a draft was proof of the importance which he and the Persian Government attached to this subject. . , . . , 2. I now have the honour to transmit a copy of the text oi this draft, exactly as I received it from Teymourtache, and to offer certain observations thereon. n 1 , . . 3. The preamble calls for little comment, although it needs correction in matters of form and language. The words “ la pratique du ’ are redundant, but appear to be unobjectionable in themselves. The adjective illicite ” seems also to be unobjectionable, although the adjective “ irregulier,' which I adopted in my draft enclosed in my private letter of the 25th September to Mr. Rendel, is the one used in the international convention of 1925. 4. Article 1 of Teymourtache’s draft corresponds exactly with article 1 (1) of my draft. , . . , 5. Article 2 of Tevmourtache’s draft also corresponds in general with article 3 (1) of my draft! It naturally omits the words k ‘ en principe, ’ which are dependent upon the remaining sections of the same article. It also provides that, while Persian warships shall onlv supervise vessels flying the Persian hag. British warships shall supervise all other vessels whatsoever. Presumably this generosity is intentional; if so, it indicates a most satisfactoij f i a me o min . It would be for His Majesty’s Government to decide whether, from the point ot view of our relations with other Powers, it is possible to accept the °ff 61 &gt; in . ac ua , practice, the position resulting from it would be very similar to that envisage by the international convention of 1925. t . . L1 r&gt; 6. Article 3 corresponds to my article 2. and is unobjectionable excep the definition of territorial waters as being 7 kilom. in extent, which 1 presume can in no circumstances be accepted. .. 7. Article 4. to which I have little doubt Teymourtache attaches grea importance, is also, I fancy, entirely unacceptable, and as e ^ , convention is not in force it is really pointless as well. 1SC P variants below. . , i fmm 8.

The prospects of getting tiie regime adopted as a whole, were in Mr, Carr’s opinion, some what remote. Persia was strongly opposed to it froa the fir'd, and apparently maintained her objections. The fact that the 1925 Convention had uevor been brought into force tended to show that it was not generally viewed with favour. The Admiralty case for the retention of the regime had been stated In a recent letter which he believed they nad all seen ,vk. IU.NOOCX said that the Admiralty were strongly In favour of the retention of the whole regime but considered that some mediflcatione might well be made to meet to some extent at any rate the objections of Iiidla and Persia. MS.

With regard to the diffictilty raised by the use of the word •’authorisation', Mr. TtJPHm said that he would have thought that authorisation to fly the flag was given ipso facto on registration, anl that there was no point in the use of the word. iH. ■■ R assked What was the possibility of getting the provisions dealing with special tones amended?

INDIA OFFICE Colonial Office, Downing Street, ,S'. W'.l.212 Downing Street, Dear Warner, 31st January, 1933. Thank: you for your letter of January the 24th # enoloslrifc your provisional record of the Meeting on January 2Qth about the special zones provisions of the Arns Traffic Convention. I am authorised to say that the Colonial Office view is in favour of retaining the special zones; as regards the question of the inclusion of the Persian Gull, see (b) on pa^e 8 of your record, if the proposed special treatment is regarded as the most practicable means of getting over the difficulty in regard to that region, we do not wish to raise any objection. The Colonial Office has considered the question of the possible proposal that the special zone provisions should be extended to the whole world. I am able to say that we do not thini: that such a plan \ would be open to special objection from the point of view of the Colonial Office, as restriction of general application might probably be applied without difficulty in the whole of our dependencies. But we realise that general issues of policy are involved with which the Colonial Office is not primarily concerned. One more point, which is to say that I should like the report of ay remarks on page 2 to be \ reworded as follows, so as to brin 0 out the 'Red Sea' aspectaspeot to which I referred, and which is not mentioned: 'Mr. James said that the Colonial Office were chiefly concerned in the lied Sea, Gulf of Aden, Palestine, and frans-Jordan areas, and that ax ter consultation with the Pesident at Aden and the High Co jnissioner fcr Palestine, they definitely desired the adoption of the 'special zone' rdgime.

P.296-1T/32* Tty dear Ho are , Plepse rer©j?- 1933 vate :;nd confidential letter Ho. 592-11, dp ted the 22nd October 1932,and subsequent correspondence on the subject of a Draft Arms Traffic Agreement with Persia. I must apologise for not having answered sooner, but it was not until the Christmas holidays that I have h&amp;d an opportunity of studying the correspondence with the care which it requires. Trie present position, as I see it, is that the Persians have suggested a bi-lateral Arms Traffic Agreement and have presented you with a Draft which you have referred to London. You nave also prepared a Draft which I have compared with that suggested by the Persians. The main advantages claimed for the bilateral Agreement are * - (ij that it will enable us to continue to search on the high seas of the Persian Gulf all Persian vessels suspected of engaging in illegal arms traffic. This right we at present have under a Finnan, which rps never been acted on and would almost certainly be denounced by the Persians if we attempted to use it. For practical purposes therefore it may be said that we cannot exercise the right at present and it would be of definite advantage to have the matter placed on a more regular footing. ( 2 ) Compliance with Persian wishes in this matter will probably assist considerably in negotiating a General Treaty xssxxKKxRjt Settlement, provided that the Arms Traffic Agreement is accepted cy us only as part of that Se ttl emen t • On the other hand, the great disadvantage of concluding sny kind of bilateral Agreement securing to ourselves the right to search Persian vessels on the high seas of the Persian3o2- Persian 'juxf is that v/e shall have to concede to the Persians the converse right to search British vessels. There is also, of course, the general objection urged by Fowle that more agreements of any kind are undesirable since they are used by the Persians to secure their oun advantage and are not complied with by them if they work to their disadvantage. you will see from the enclosed telegram regarding the Arms Traffic Convention, the Government of India are not To Secretary of State for India, London, f disposed to attach any I\ T o. 2358, dated the 15th December 1932. * ---j 1 very great importance to the retention of 'special zones' in the Persian Gulf because they do not &amp;t present regard the danger of a revival of the arms tra-L^ic as very immediate. Fowle is in agreement with this view, but the Naval Commander-in-Chief and also, I gather, His lejesty’s Government are inclined to take a different view. If our view is accepted and the 'special zones' go, it follows that the first argument stated above in favour of a bilateral Treaty loses a good deal of its force end I think that our view would definitely be in favour of abandoning our right of searching Persian vessels if as seems inevitable, the right entails giving a converse right to the Persisn Governm ent. The second argument in favour of the agreement also appears to lack force in present circumstances since owing to Kenjam and the dispute over the Anglo Persian Oil Concession, we seem to be farther than ever away from a Seneral Treaty Settlement, general opinion therefore regarding the bilateral Agreement is that it is not at present worth having, but this is, of course, only a personal opinion and may have to be modified, if His Majesty^ Government come down on the other side. I do not propose at present to discuss the details of the Draft which you have put up and I am not in a position to criticise it without consulting other Departments. But there seems to be a good deal of force in the points put forward in Fowle* s private and confidential letter of ^.oveniber the3°5 I am afraid that you must have been having a ve troublesome time at Tehran but \ hope that things will a more favourable turn in the Hew Year. With all best wishes, I am, Yours ever, Sd/- H« A»y 0 r Metcalfe His ii£.jesty , s Minister in Tehran, PersiaCONFIDENTIAL. H Special zones' are certain maritime and continental areas within which, under the provisions of tne abortive Arms Traffic Convention of 1919 and the unratified Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, the High Contracting Parties undertake to prohibit, save under the most stringent restrictions, the importation and (in the case of the maritime zones) the transport of specified arms and ammunition In the case of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, the relevant provisions are contained in Chapter III, Articles 12 to 27. 2. It will be seen from Chapter III, Article 12, sections 1 and 2 , that the land zones cover (a) the whole of Africa(except Egypt, Libia, Tunisia, Algeria, the Spanish possessions in North Africa, Abyssinia, the Union of South Africa (with its mandated territory) and Southern Rhodesia), together with adjacent islands situated within 100 marine miles from the coasts ofthe territories in question, and also Princes Island in the Bight of Biafra, St. Thomas, Annobon and Soootra, but not the Spanish islands situated to the north of the parallel of 26 degrees north latitude; and (b) the Arabian peninsula, Gwadar, Syria and Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan, and Iraq. 3. The maritime zone includes the Red Sea, tne Gulf of Aden, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and is bounded by a line drawn from and following tin latitude of Cape Guardafui to the point of intersection with longituae 57 degrees east of Greenwich and proceeding thence direct to the point at which the eastern frontier of Gwadar meets tne s ea. 4. The 1925 Convention (following thus tne Convention of 1919) provides tnat within the special zones no native vessel of less than 500 tons net tonnage shall be allowed to3o5' ship, discharge, or tranship specified arms, a,munitions and implements of war. The definition of a native vessel is one either owned, fitted-out, or commanded by a native of any country bordering on the Indian Ocean west of the meridian 95 degrees east of Greenwich and north of the parallel of 11 degrees south longitude, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, or the Gulf of Oman, or if at least half the crew are natives of such countries. 5. The question is of special interest to India from two points of view: - (a) the purely Indian; (b) in so far as she is politically responsible for the Persian Gulf. I. The Indian aspect . 6 . As regards the purely Indian aspect, the effect of the previsions quoted above is, as will be seen, to discriminate against Indian and Burman ships, all of which fall within the category of native vessels. The Government of India have consistently taken the strongest exception to this discrimination (and have intimated that they are unwilling to accede to theConvention unless and until that discrimination is removed). The Indian objection to the provisions regarding Native Ships is twofold. (1) Any sort of regime discriminating against 'native ships' (as defined above) is regarded as an affront to the dignity of India. The discrimination is of course not against Indian ships alone but against those of India and a number of other countries near the Special Maritime Zone, but tuis does not v/eaken the objection Ox the Government of India to the discrimination. It has been suggested/3o&lt;5, suggested that tne fact of the ships discriminated against beiag entitled 'native ships' is an aggravation of the aifront, but it is hard to maintain tnis argument as the term 'native ships' is in common use and used by the Government of India, e.g. in their Trade Returns. (2) There are certain practical difficulties in the my of enforcing the provisions of the Convention in regard to native ships so far as India is concerned: (a) Under Article 22 of the Convention 'native vessels' ii oi less tnan 500 tons must obtain a written authorisation to fly the flag of a Hish Contracting Party and such authorisation may only be granted ' unde registered ir India) is bound to hoist its oroper national colours on certain occasions, and tfie i Government of India consider tnat legislation in the United Kingdom would be necessary in order to give effect to Article 22 of the Convention. The Foard of Trade on theother hand have expressed the view tnat it would be possible to deal with this w i^ 4 fi 0U ^ ? uc ^ legislation. For a better understanding of the difficulties involved reference may be made to tne attached copy of correwpondence. (b) Under Article 21 all 'native vessels' (apparently without any tonnage limit of any sort) are required to carry manifests when in the Special zone. A number of Lascar Ships owned by important Companies and managed by reputable Agents which- though probably all above 500_tons - fall within the definition of i the ncellation - ——-j- very considerable inconvenience and expense to the Companies concerned. On this point also further information can be gaonered from the attached copy of correspondence* It is understood that the British Government hope to be able to meet the above objections of the Oovaniment of India by getting a Sub-Committee now sitting at Geneva to accept a re-draft of the relative provisions of the Convention under which (1) the Special regime will be applied to all ships of a tonnage of less than 500 (probably 400), not 'native' ships only, (2) nothing in the Special regime will apply to any ship over 500 tons, and (3) the wordirg of Article 22 will be amended so that ships required by the legislation of a High Contracting/Contracting Party to fly the flag of such Hio-h Contracting Party will have to be provided with a 0.0 V”* h' ”« n ■ 1 ■, 1 — U 0 ' J ® in the Special Zone instead of with a document autnorising tnem to fly the flag of a High Contracting Party, ' J 9. If the British proposals for amendment of the Contention are met with ccunter-proposals from foreign representatives of the Subcommittee, the British representative may be expected to confer with thelndian Delegation to the Disarmament Conference as to the acceptability of the Foreign amendments from thepoint of view of India. 10* The idea of a special regime for 'native vessels' in a Special Zone is borrowed, as will be seen from the attached correspondence, from the General Act of the Brussels Conference of 1890, which has been ratified by the Government of India. But this fact does not justify the inference that the attitude of the Government of India in regard to the present Convention is unreasonable, firstly because the ideas of 1932 are not those of 1890 in regard to such matters and secondly because owing to differences in the definition of 'native vessels' and of the Special Zone no Indian ships other than coasting craft based on Aden are affected by the General Act of the Brussels Conference. II. The Persian Gulf. 11* The history of the Amis Traffic in the Persian Gulf end of the question of the special zones in relation to that area is described in the Political Department memorandum B.410, of which copies are attached. For reasons very similar to those actuating the Government of India in respect of Indian ships and waters, the Persian Government have hitherto steadfastly refused to accede to the Convention. They strongly resent the classification ofSo-g the Persian Gulf as a special maritime zone and the discrimination against Persian vessels involved in the 1925 Convention in its present form. 12. From the British point of view the non-accession of Persia has in the past been a matter of less importance, for she has had no naval forces and even if willing could in practice have done little to carry out the obligations incumbent on her under the Convention. The situation is, however, now changed, for not only is the Central Government in Persia at the moment in effective control of the country as a wnole, but she has purchased certain naval units from Italy and has in addtion acquired armed preventive launches. 13. But the position is complicated from our point of view by the fact that Persia, were she to accede to a Convention of the nature of the 1925 Convention, would acquire a right of inspecting the dhows of our Arab proteges in the Persian Gulf. There is general agreement that she would abuse anv such rinht if granted to her and in these circumstances the Resident in the Persian Culf and the Government of India, with whom the India as at present advised, Office and/the Preign Office agree, consider that if there is any risk of Persia accedirg to theConvention and if the special zones are retained tnen we must press for the exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the special zone regime Tne risks of any substantial increase in the arms traffic in this area are so far as can be judged at the present time small. The Central Government of Persia, for its own reasons, is anxious to keep any such traffic under the most stringent control, while theNorth West frontier is saturated with arms and ammunition and likely to remain so for some time to come. On the other hand, tne political dangers involved in the grant of a right of inspect ion/inspection of Arab dhows are real and immediate, and on a balance of advantage are thought by the political departments concerned to outweigh the disadvantages of excluding thePersian Gulf from the special zone. In these circumstances the British representative on the Manufacture of Arms Sub-Committee which is at present dealing with the question is not unlikely to be instructed to direct his tactics by those of the Persians - in other words, so long as the Persians refuse to sign any Convention under which the Persian Gulf would be classified as a Special Zone, to press for the retention of all existing special zones, but if and when the Persians show signs of acquiescirg in such classification, to press for the exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the regime. 31 JAN 1935f FiL (129 groups) ^Q-YJUUUL Qf TK I.EGRam.

A meeting took place at the Foreign Office yesterday to consider the line to he taken at Geneva in regard to the retention of special zones. Lr. Carr was present, Mr. E.J. Turner and I represented this Office, and there were also present Colonial Office, War Office, Admiralty and Board of Trade. ^• ‘A-S &amp; result of discussion it was agreed; (a) that the B.&amp; 0. Department and the Board of xrade should collahoraue with a view to clearing up the points in which the uroveinment of India were directly interested, viz. the classification cf Indian ships as native vessels, the authorisation to fly flags, etc.; (h) subject to further consideration by the Admiralty of the effect on their general position of the fact that the adherence of Saudi Arabia and Iraq need not be expected, and that in Mr. Carr f s view there was no prospect of Persia acceding so long as the Persian Gulf i emained a special zone, that i^r. Carr should at u eneva be guided in his tactics by the attitude of the Persians - that so long as the Persians maintained their present attitude of refusing to accede to any instrument unaer which the Persiai Gulf was classified as a special zone he should press for the retention of special zones everywhere, but that in the event of Persia showing signs of acquiescing in such classification he should then press -^or the exemption of the Persian Gulf from the special zones. On a minor but important point of detail Mr.Carr -^pressed the opinion that while reservations of any nature Aeie unae siraDle in principle so far as they could be -voia bLl&gt; ae saw no difficulty about a reservation by IndiaSic? to tiie sections or chapters dealing with the special zones in the event of its proving impossible to meet her over the definition of native ships, etc. 4* The question of liaison with Mr. Carr on oehalf of Inaia was raised. He at first suggested tiat if India, who was not represented on his suh-Conmittee, wished to raise any special points in connection with the report of that Coremittee they must do so in the main Conference; ou. alter further discussion agreed to take any drafting suggestions which were indicated to him on hehalf of India and make them his own (so long, that is, as they did not run counter to the attitude of H.M.G.) and to Keep in touch with the Indian delegation to the Disarmament Conference. Any major point which India desired to raise would clearly have to be raised by her representatives in the main Conference on the report of fne 3 ud-C ommittee• I mentioned that I understood that Mr. 3*K. Brown was arranging that Major Beasley should specialise in this subject and Mr. Carr indicated that he would willingly keep in touch with him. Ute conclusions of the meeting will be circulated for approval. Mr. Carr now thinks that it is likely to be a fortnight before the question becomes active. By then we should have received the^views of the Government of' India. But action on the lines indicated above would be entirely consistent with their readiness and that of the Resident to abandon a special zone in the Persian Gulf if its retention could be secured only at the risk of giving Persia a right of inspection of Arab vessels.'683 UM.-D * r The Under Secretary of state for War, presents his compliments to the Under Secretary of State for India and would he glad if he could be furnished with a copy of India Office letter Uo. p.Z.7625/32 dated 21st December, 1832, addressed to the Under secretary of state for foreign Affairs on the subject of the revision of the Arms Traffic Convention, 1925.

There is no longer any general Convention in force accoruin^ ohe right 01 search ..or sla'es, ^ut the Convention of 10th September 1919, revising the General Acts of Berlin (1885) and of Brussels (1890), states that the signatories (U.S.A., Belgium, British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal) will endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms, and of the slave trade bp land and sea. It can also be arguedthat the obligations of the General Act of 1890 stil apply to countries who were parties to it but not to the 1919 Convention, and therefore to Turkey and the States who have succeeded her. The latter would, however, probably refuse to ad ,it this. A further legal basis of a similar kind could possibly be found in the Anglo Turkish Treaty of 1881 for the suppression of the African slave trade. A more definite legal basis in respect of Hejasi, Asiri and Nejd vessels is provided by Article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 in which Ibn Saud undertook 'to co-operate by all the means at his disposal w : th his Britannic Majesty in the suppression of the slave trade'. 8. Treaties are still in force under which ... . Snips can search vessels of the following countries for slaves, viz. Borneo, Egypt (vessels under 500 tons', Italy, hiteria, husoat, Persia, Spain (vessels under 500 tons;, and -ahrein and the Trucial, Sheikhdoms (Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, ajman, Urn -A1 -Qaiwain and Has -al -Khaima). 3. By custom, however, native vessels within One Pea Sea may be searched for slaves outside the territorial waters of French and Italian colonies whatever ilag they may be flying. Searches in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper/324 proper (as distinct from Asir), i.e. north of Dahban, should, however, u e conducted with great discretion and should not take place at all in the vicinity of important oorts. ? must also be oaken to avoid giving offence to the French or Italian authorities by undue restraint on dhows legitimately sailing under their colours. The authority to fly the flag should be carried Vy the d,iOw. 5. Search must always be carried out in the manner laid down in the Slave Trade Instructions, ^ol.l. o. The main craffic in slaves is believedto cross from the Alien oo ^iie Arabian shore in the narrower waters at the southern end of the Red Sea, proceeding thence up the Arabian coast, inside the islands and reefs as far as possible, to the trading ports. 7• Runar' y S1 a-'es . The Arabs regard slaves as recognised servants, and to give refuge to runaways is liable to cause great irritation. On the other hand, it is against British or inch res to refuse these people refuge. Cora and ing Officers are, therefore, to consult British Consular or Political representatives in Arabia as soon as possible as to action to be taken. Prevention of Illic it Traffic in Arms and fciuhition . The Arms Traffic Convention of the 17th June, 1975, is not in force. Nevertheless, in taking steps for the prevention of the illicit traffic in arms by native vessels, the procedure laid down in this Convention should v e followed. By this Convention, H.M. Shi os have the right only to 'verify the flag' in native vessels under 500 tons which fly tue flag of one of the parties to the Convention. Under this Convention, if no authority to fly the fl^g is forthcoming if, inspite of such authority, strong suspicion still exists that the vessel is carrying on illicit traffic in ams °nd ammunition, she may be conducted to the nearest port of the/325 the Power whose flag she has flown, is given by the Convention. No r ight of search ?. By custom native vessels within the Bed Sea may be searched for ams outside the territorial waters of French 'no Italian ca onies, whatever flag they may be flying In view, however, of the absence of specific legal sanction for carrying out searches for arms in the Red Sea, it is of importance that all searches should be ostensibly for slaves nd noo or arms. Searches in the territorial waters of the Kejaz proper as distinct from Asir, i.e. north of Dabhan, ?nou u 0 conducted with great discretion and should not take place &amp;o all in the vicinity of important ports. If a native vessel is found to be carrying a greater number of ai.-h v,.an is necessary for the normal crew, it may beassumed tna t» ln t ' iie absence of a special licence, they are doing so i illegal 1 y and any rifles or pistols (but not swords or daggers) in excess of this number should be confiscated, but in the case of a dhow whichcould prove Hejazi or Asiri origin no action should be taken in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper (as distinct from Asir), i.e. north of Dahban. If any considerable quantity of arms is found on board, r tliere is ^ strong suspicion that the vessel is engaged in illegal traffic in arms or ammunition, the procedure laid aown An ex II, Section II of the Arms Traffic Convention ~ 8 L '° carried out in the case of vessels flying the flag of one oi the signatories to that Convention or flying no flag, dunject to the provisions of paragraph 2 a-ove, native vessels flying the flag of a country that is not a signatory should ce taken to Aden.

SLA Tr 3 AND AH-S TRADE IN PKRstam ffHT.jr Rln.^e Traffic. There is no longer any general Contention in force according the right of search for slaves, but the Convention of 10th September 1919, revising the General Acts of Berlin (1885) and of Brussels (1890) states that the signatories (U.S.A., Belgium, British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal), will endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms, and of the slave trade by land and sea. It can also be argued that the obligations of the General Act of 1690 still apply to countries who were parties to it but to the 1919 Convention, and therefore to Turkey and the States who have succeeded her. The latter would, however, orobably refuse to admit this. A further legal basis of a similar kind could possibly be found in the Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1381 for the suppression of the African slave trade. A more definite legal basis in respect of Hajzai, Asiri, and Nejd vessels is provided by Article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 in which Ibn Saud undertook 'to co-operate by all the means at his disposal with His Britannic Majesty in the suppression of the slave trade'. 2. Treaties are still in force between his Majesty’s Government and the following states, by which the cruisers of the former are allowed to search the vessels of the latter for slaves, viz. Borneo, Egypt (vessels under 500 tons), Italy, Liberia, Muscat, Persia, Spain (vessels under 500 tons) and Bahrein and the Trucial SeeLkhdoms (Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, Una-rl-h iwai , and Has -al -Mhaima). 3. The Anglo-Persian Slavery Convention of v jb2 is still in force. Article 1 of,this Convention states tnat the object of the possible visit and detention of Persian merchant3.22 9/'T ''IT 9 ' wmm merchant vessels was 'in order to prevent the chance of ne.gro ■ » - n - c., .le, @in^ imported into Persi' n . Although there is now no traffic in negro slaves, the convention appears none the less to confer on His .Majesty's Govern: ent the right to visit and detain Persian ships for slaves of all races. The Persian government maintain that the contention is out of date, and so inapplicable to existing circumstances as to he virtually null and void; but this is not admitted by His Majesty’s Government. 4. By custom, however, native vessels within the Persian Gulf may be searched for slaves, whatever flag they may be flying, except as stated in the following paragraphs. 5. Search must always be carried out in the manner laid down in the Slave Trade Instructions, Volume I. 6. As regards Persian vessels, the practice of search is to be continued in the neighbourhood of the slave route between Mekran andthe Arabian coast where action could be justified under the 1882 Slave Convention and by the right which is exercised to search vessds in Arab territorial waters in this Area. Greater care is necessary in areas such as the north-western portion of the Persian Gulf. In the latter case Persian vessels are only to be examined where definite information or very strong suspicion exists and in no case are Persian vessels to be searched in Persian territorial waters. V. As regards Iraqi vessels, on the high seas no change should be made in the present practice, although the legal position is doubtful. In Iraqi territorial waters no action should be taken except in special cases and then as far as possible in consultation with the Port of Basra authorities. Q* Nejdi dhows should as a general rule be exempted from supervision within Nejdi territorial waters. TT.LTGTT AR.S TRAFFIC. The Arms Traffic Convention of the 17th June, 1925,32? is not in force. Nevertheless, in taking steps for the prevention of the illicit traffic in ams by native vessels, the procedure laid down in this Convention should be followed. By this Convention, H.f. Ships have the rigtt only to 'verify the flag in native vessels under 500 tons which fly the flag of one of the parties to the Convention. Under tins convention, if no authority to fly the flag is forthcoming, or 11 , i )ite of such authority, strong suspicion still exists that the vessel is carrying on illicit traffic in arms and ammunition, she may be conducted to tne nearest port of the Power whose flag she has flown. No right of search is given by the Convention. 2 - B y custom, however, native vessels within the Persian G-ulf may be searched for arms except as stated in the following paragr • ons. If native vessels searched are found to be carrying a g-eater number of arms than is necessary for the no1 C1 6W &gt; ^ ma y assumed that, in the absence of a special lie nee, they are doing so illegally and any rifles or pistols v (out not swords or daggers) in excess of this number should be confiscated. If any considerable quantity of arms is found on board, or if there is a strong suspicion that the vessel is enga ed i 1 legal traffic in arms or ammunition, the procedure aid down in Annex II, Section II, of the Arms Traffic Convention is to be carried out in the case of vessels flying -he flag of one of the signatories to that Convention or flying no flag. The search of Persian vessels for arms could in case of need be justified by an arrangement made with Persia in 1397 -lich has never been cancelled; but it would be a mistake to a Ppeal to this arrangement at the present time, when there appears to be no extensive illegitimate traffic in arms; the Persian Government would undoubtedly repudiate it if brought to -heir notice. The existence of this 1Q97 arrangement mightYe extremely useful later in the event of a growth of the trafi ic, e.g« .01 re-exportation to India or Afghanistan* Persian vessels should therefore not be searched for arms in Persi; n territorial waters, and on the high seas only where definite information or very strong suspicion exists. 5. His Majesty* s ^-overn ent have no jurisdiction over Iraq vessels and no jurisdiction over vessels in Iraqi territorial waters. No steps have been tadcen to apoly the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919 to Iraq, as it has never entered into force; His Majesty’s Oovernment therefore have no power under Iraqi municipal law to enforce the stipulations of the Convention in Iraqi territorial waters. As regards the Arms Traffic Convent'on of 1925, although the signature of the British representative purports to cover Iraq, it was subsequently realised that it was constitutionally impossible for His Majesty’s Government to accede to International Agreements on behalf of Iraq and it is proposed that the necessary steps shall be taken, so soon as the Convention enters into force, to remove Iraq from the special zone. In practice the authorities of the Port of Basra could arrange for action to be taken in Iraqi national waters in cases of importance. 6. As regards Iraqi vessels on the high seas, no change should v e made in the present practice, although Hie legal position is doubtful. In Iraqi territorial wafers no snui n should be taken except in great emergency and then in consultation with the Port of Basra authorities. 7. Nejdi dhows should as a general ru:e be exempted from supervision within Nejdi territorial waters. 8.

Foreign Office, S.W.l. 10th January, 1933. Sir, Witn reference to your letter K$. E. and 0.32^4 of the 2nd December last, 1 am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state, for the inlomation of the Secretary of State lor India, that he concurs in the view that some legislation may be required in India to fulfil the obligations of Articles 21 and 22 of the Arms Traffic Convention of the 17th June, 1925 in its present form. The Board of Trade can best say whether such legislation should take the character of an amendment to the Merchant Shippi^t; Act, or whether it should be effected in some other way. no doubt the extension of the provisions of the Convention to all vessels below a certain tonnage will make the necessity of fresh legislation more obvious and may entail legislation in this country. 2. Sir John Simon does not consider, however, that the necessity of passing legislation is an insuperable difficulty in the way of accepting the provisions of the Convention provided that this is considered desirable on other grounds. In this connexion, I am to point out that legislation in this country will certainly be required to enable His Majesty’s Government to become a party to the Manufacture of Arms Convention. 3. As regards paragraph 3 of your letter under reference, Sir John Simon finis it difficult to construe The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, ArticleArticle 22 of the Convention as if the words 'within 'the zones' were inserted therein. In the first place, if the words are to be inserted in the Article, they would presumably follow the words 'no authorisation' and, at a result, native vessels would be authorised to fly uhe flag in one place and not authorised to fly it in another. Sir John Simon knows of no instance where a vessel is authorised to fly the British flag in one place and not in another. Secondly, vessels sail all over the seas and there is no guarantee whatever that a native vessel authorised to fly the British flag in the Bay of Bengal will not make an appeararce in the Persian half a short time later. This question raised by the Government of India in paragraph 8 of their letter of the 13th September, 1930, will not, of course, arise in the event of the present suggestion that the category of native vessels shall be abolished being adopted since, in that case, Article 22 will apply to all ships under a fixed tonnage flying the flag of countries who are a party to the Arms Traffic Convention. 4. Copies of this letter are beirg sent to the admiralty, Board of Trade and Colonial Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Sgd, C.Howard Smith.g 1 ' . .

Copies oi our letter of 21st December, supporting the views of the Government of India (subject to toe cormients of the Admiralty) were sent by the air mail of 23rd December to Bushire and the Government of India. Tile Admiralty now produce a lengthy and ( reasoned series of objections to action on the lines proposed by the Government of India and the Resident, (see their letter to Foreign Office of 11th January on P.Z.250/33 below). 3 * 0 f theirarguments are, I think, special pleading or rather unconvincing. This is particularly so as regards the right of inspection of Arab dhows by Persian ships. In the first place, what we want to prevent is any inspection of Arab dhows by Persians because of our certainty, based on past experience, that it will be abused. Secondly, as the Tamb Incidents show, it is in practice almost impossible to bring home to the Persians improper action by their preventive service, and considerable risk that we shall get no satisfaction out of them and have ourselves to compensate the injured Arab proprietors. Finally, (paragraph 5 of Admiralty letter) so long as the present Persian Navy remains in being there is quite a/I i I a considerable risk of patrolling oeing done 'by it in the Persian Gulf* 4 . Nor do I think that the argument in paragraph 9 is entirely convincing; while as regards paragraph IS the Government of India are in practically the same position as Persia in objecting to special zones. 5. I have discussed the Admiralty letter infonnaliy with the Foreign Office. They are particularly anxious to clear the ground as soon as possible, since kr. Carr is to be here until the beginning of next week and they attach importance to giving him some definite instructions and arranging for discussion between him and the other interested Departments before his return to Geneva. In the circumstances we might I think consider telegraphing to the Government of India and the Resident on the general lines of the draft attached. It will be well to draw them more specifically on the possibility of excluding the Persian Gulf from the special zone area while retaining special zones elsewhere, and we might also consult them on the Question of tactics referred to in the telegram.

Addressed G.of I Repeated Political^Resident, \ BushireCOHFIDflKTlAL M. 034 05/32 , p z’ 11th Jam3fP7,- r r a T -250 i Sir, I am oommanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to India office letter No. P.2*7625/32 of 21st ultimo to the Foreign Office concerning the revision of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, a copy of which was forwarded to the Admiralty, and to put forward the following observations for the consideration of the secretary of state for Foreign Affairs. 2. My Lords note with surprise that the Government of India prefer the abandonment of the ’special zones” provisions of the 1925 Convention to any attempt to maintain these provisions even with the modification that the maritime supervision clauses should apply to all (and not merely so-called native) vessels below 400 (instead of 500) tons, and they regret that the secretary of state for India is in general agreement with this view. 3* Although, as the Government of India point out, gun-running is not at present a live danger, My Lords consider*.• • Secretary of State, foreign office*350 2 • consider that It is impossible to forecast what the position may be in the future. They think it possible that conditions in the countries bordering the Persian Sulf and the Bed sea may one day become such that gun- running will again be a profitable occupation and against t; e interests of the British j£nplre 9 and that in these circumstances history will repeat itself and the armament firms of most arms producing countries will seize their opportunities and will not be seriously interfered with by their Governments in spite of agreements to control oxports. 4# The Government of India are apparently relying on meeting a revival of gun-running by a revision of the Convention. My Lords are convineed that the conditions in which a eerioue revival of gun-running might take place are such that there would be little hope of getting the Convention revieed while those conditions continued. 5* If the risk of a revival of gun-running is very elight, then the risk that the maritime supervision clauses w il 1 be abused and ships engaged in legitimate trade ^Justifiably interfered with is correspondingly reduced. Moreover, with the safeguards in the convention and the unlikelihoodunlikelihood of nmch patrolling being done in the special zones by any Havy other than the British, My lords consider i* In08t rmlikely that there will be any serious interference with ships engaged in legittmate trade. 6. Another reason given by the Sovernment of India for preferring the abandonment of the 'speoial zones' is that it is likely to be forced on us in any case, and it would seem impolitic to press for something which we shall probably fail to secure. It will, however, be borne in mind that far-reaching and indeed fantastic proposals for the regulation of the manufacture of and traffic in arms are being put forward at Geneva, and it would seem illogical that we should abandon our support of a measure of maritime supervision in areas where such traffic is most likely to be dangerous, especially when such abandon ment may also have the r esult that it will be very diffi«lt to continue to control a still more nefarious slave traffic with which it has always been intimately associated in practice and in international conventions. My lords venture to suggest, for the consideration of Secretary of state, that we should be more, and not lilcelylikely to be able to resist propoeala relating to arme traffic which we dislike if we oan show that even thie very mild measure of supervision is un- i acceptable to other States represented at Geneva. 7. The third reason put forward by the Government of India for abandonment is that if Persia ratifies the Convention she will have a right to search Arab vessels. The Convention gives no right of search but only very limited powers of supervision. My Lords suggest that the provisions in the convention for payment of compensation for wrongful exercise of the right, the possibility of retaliatory action against Persian ships, and the possibility of the Persian war ships spending most of their time in port, provide adequate safeguards in this respect. 8# The Government of Indian fourth reason is the apparent conflict between Article £2 of the conven tion and the Merchant shipping Act. My Lords do not, however, quite appreoiate what oonstitutes the conflict between the Convention and the Merchant shipping Act. presumably• tf;'* f *■ t- '.a. - fs- • V ^ u ► t-S :;a -'V $ h-*;t ■ : 0 :: rpto j _ • • . j o&lt;5 aii? »oq:o^q oct $ucj -n-tis mo &amp; 11 sflSfelh m? m -ftif •! itoig i VX to OXOOBOa £&gt;I, 0O«fiMPOOtl^^1C B 344 n i ^aBiafirotoi' i^i .■)*ur;^ :■; ..I J a^..: * ©▼«•* m : ‘&gt; c *;» Xi9tO|t«trc8&gt;C' 04^ + - «. 4 ®' :,de i0 J • 15 °* ssyt 3 -ToWaat.-no e/« . eieaaet » ' ' ' *U * *10 vT liOld'nsnaoo vdt ia a 14 ' u -oi4«Oito^0jl tc tfair^r ■ ■''•**'• ^'■ '^“ ^ . »« Off &lt; jt L id JioOOft : f(4 . ^ '' : “ ' ''' V ' i ' &gt; ' li x - ; « ’&gt; g '•»*• A « , Sri • n. • j ■■0 '-i •! n-ii *10 ,r»e/g ^alhasqe taifc • roer^o-. e Idi at et.^eim ^ ^teriK.sy c r • x&gt; V Sl‘ - •' - - : - ■ ' '/ i j 1 ^ ;;.. ; ; u *' «oew4 ec d'oJtl'.tijoo * J ^ • •'- •»&gt;-*• &gt; 4 «■ dp 6liit J J; ^ 3r(|- •oioO'Uoi^o tad# ; ;j . . vaMft DO Odi.- ifto ; 4 act fl 3^ srteii? t:,£(4- d iJiflKO 6*0-it Sliri’,' ti « ooitBOvaoS i • - ■•: •. i. 0 sts Otj-Sfi OE! 1:4 Jt*£Ort it cr.gfit $&amp; £* &amp;d . t r.t .

Article 73 of the iterohant Shipping Act lays down that the red eneign is the proper national colours for ships belonging to British subjects and looses penalties for flying other colours without a warrant. Article 74 looses penalties for not shewing the proper national colours on a signal nade by one of H.M. Ships or on entering or leaving port (British port only if ship of 5o tons gross or above). The argument that it will be neoessary to amend these articles if Article 82 of the Arms Traffic Convention came into force does not appear very convincing. »o conflict would seem to arise if the Indian vessels in question complied with Article 22 when it becomes part of British and Indian law as it must if the convention comes into force, it would be no defence against a prosecution under Articles or 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act to plead that the ship in question had no authorisation to fly the red ensign because she had not complied rith the conditions laid down in the legislation enforcing Article 22 of the QQT8H o XX C e e •354 6 . Canven tion. It would be the buelneee of the owner of the ship to con^ly with those oonditions and failing to do so would make him liable to a double penalty. The oonditions of Article 22 do not appear to be particularly onerous and no doubt oould be modified to meet any important objection. 9. The political Resident in the Persian Gulf in hie telegram of the 7th December, 1932, assumes that the only gun-running with which we need concern ours elves is that which might be for the tribes of the ff.W. frontier of India* The more convenient source of supply of arms for these tribes is presumably Russia through Afghanistan, but this supply oould be stopped or reduced to a minimum provided Afghanistan continued friendly. With Persia unfriendly illicit arms may again follow their old channel via the Persian Gulf and Persia to the frontier. It is, however, not only the supply of arms to the tribes of the N.W* frontier of India that we may want to stop. Conditions may arise in the future in which we may want to stop arms going from Persia to Arabia* It would indeed be optimistic to assume that diplomatic pressure on Persia will in itcelf be sufficient toto present the continuance of a traffic which may be harmful to British interest®. 10. M7 Lorfee also consider that the political Resident is unduly optimistic in stating that shipments of arms by steamers to the Gulf could be checked under Chapter II of the 1925 Convention. Tiis chapter provides for a system of export licences and the publication of statistics. Experience of the China Arms Embargo and of the provisional agreement between the principal powers to apply the 1919 Arms Traffic Convention to the special zones gives grounds for doubt as to whether this Chapter will be effective. My Lords consider that Maritime supervision by this country is much the more reliable deterrent. If these clauses were now to be definitely rejected at Geneva, My Lords think it probable that the Navy would find that its powers of supervision in these waters in peace time would repidly disappear, it is true that the powers exercised have little legal basis owing to the failure of Governments to ratify agreements reached at international conferences, but their formal o an collation, which will no doubt be well advertised by Persia, would be such a complete break with the pest that6. our rights, based mainly on custom, would almost certainly be generally challenged. H. An important point, of which My Lords consider Hach could be made at Geneva, is that these clauses of the Arms traffic Convention are intimately connected with the question of prevention of slave traffic, as is remarked on in paragraphs 13 and 14 below, and if abolished in one case, it will be much more difficult, if nottmpo ssible, to get them accepted in the other. 12• in dealing with the opposition to the H speoial % zones ', which is mainly the result of Persia 1 * narrow minded and assertive nationalism, it should also be emphasised that the special zones system is not something of reoent origin put forward by Great Britain but is much older than even the 1919 Arms Traffic Convention, having been embodied in the General Aot of the Brussels - Conference of 1890* It is true that the maritime super vision articles of the 1890 Act only refer specifically to the repression of the slave trade, but the connection between illicit arms traffic and slave traffic is clearly recognised in it. Moreover, the Persian objections do not refer particularly to special zones in connection with •••••••9. 357 with arm® traffic, but to the inclusion of the pereian Gulf in any epeoial zones« 13. Another point to whioh attention should be drawn is that although the General Act of 1890 was abrogated by a 1919 Convention drafted at the same time as the 1919 Arms Traffic Convention and signed on the same day, it was not anticipated that the 1919 convention abrogating the 1890 agreement would, but the 1919 Arms Traffic Convention would not, be ratified; nor that no definite provisions for maritime supervision in connection with the slave trade would get embodied in any international agreement. It was not until 1926 that any general convention about the slave trade was signed and this left for a later convention definite provisions for maritime supervision. It does, however, contain in Article 5 dif following paragraph:- 'The High Contracting parties undertake to negotiate as soon as possibls a general convention with regard to the slave trade whioh will give them rights and Impose upon them duties of the eaii;' nature as those provided for in the Convention of the 17th June, 1925, relative to the international Trade10 in Arms (articles 12 t 2q 9 £l f 22, 22, 24 and paragraph* 3 t 4 and 5 of section II of Annex n), with the necessary adaptation*, it being under stood that this general contention will not place the ships (eren of small tonnage) of any High Contracting paiHes in a position different from that of the other High Contracting Partie*', This reference to the Arm* Traffic Contention of 1925 is to the special sones articles and to the Annexe dealing with maritime supertision. 14. The objections of Persia to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the special maritime sone hate no substantial basis in tiew of the fact that the limited powers of supertision authorised by the Contention can only be exercised outside territorial waters. It cannot be disputed that the Persian Gulf is an area in which illicit arms traffic has frequently been oarried on in the past and may be again. It is not made clear in the contention that the territorial waters of oountriee that are, like Persia, not in cluded in the special land zones are not included in the maritime zone, but this could be con- and no particular. •• •l/ 11 . particular reaaom i« seen why it should not be* Persia would then cease to hare any grievance on this point as the high seas of the Persian Gulf are free to all and therefore a legitimate area for international control• 15. My Lords desire to en^hasise that without these powers of supervision we have practically no legal powers to take action on the high seas except in the case of vessels flying the Muscat flag. The so-called agreement with Persia of 1897 was only an exchange of notes giving powers in special circumstances and admittedly could and would be promptly repudiated by Persia if we took action under it. probably we could continue to assume or could get powers in respeot ofto coneider thi* queetion in all ite aapeote. 17 .

Dear Warner, Many thanks for your letter (E 6210/2529/34) of December 2nd which has introduced me for the first time to the appalling complications of the question of the special zones. I told Charles Howard-Smith a couple of days ago (and I hope he passed thej information on to you) that we shall not tackle Traffic in Arms till January, so that I shall have an opportunity of talking the thing over with you in London. But let me put up at once, for your consideration, a rather obvious point which occurs to me. So far as my occidental mind is capable of grasping what seems to be a particularly oriental situation, we are behaving exactly as if the 1925 convention were in force, which it is not; and the Persians, for their part, object not to our illegal behaviour, but to our attempt to legalise it by putting the text of the abortive 1925 convention into the Disarmament Convention. I should have thought that this was pre-eminently the sort of thing which we did not want to drag into the Genevese light of day. It seems to me one of those delicate aituacions which should be as jealously protected from public dis cussion as the honour of Caesar’s wife. If we are satisfied (as I gather we are) with the practical, though illegal, status quo , surely our best course is to sit tignt and say as little/ . U / V &gt; ^.A. Warner, Esqlittle as possible, since any controversy one way or the other must tend ipso facto to disturb it. We need not commit ourselves one way or the other on the merits of the zones. We can perfectly well take the line (or fall in with it when others take it) that these arrange ments, however excelle nt,are of local importance and that the matter is not suitable for discussion in connection with a disarmament convention whose provisions i are intended to be of general application. I should be delighted to indulge in a 'strong attack on the Persian position” (vide paragraph 9 of your letter), if our own position were even remotely tenable. But it seems to me on the information which you give me, that the Persian reply would probably be to draw attention to our present illegal behaviour and perhaps threaten us to denounce us to the Council. There is after all a proverb - perhaps it doesn't apply in the East - about people who live in glass houses. Yours ever, (Sgd.) E.H. Carr.371 $8/25*9/a 4 • 14th Doo^mber, 19ii2.

Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department.g, &amp; 0. 8224/1932 Immediate India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 2 nd December, 1932. Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter No.Wd0055/72/95 dated 20th October, 1930, regarding certain questions raised by the Government of India in connection with the Arms Traffic Convention of the 17th June, 1925. The question of a revision of this Convention having been raised at Geneva in connection with the Disarmament Conference, a telegram was sent to the Government of India on the 1st December, as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affair is aware, suggesting among other things the possibility of abolishing the category of ’’native vessels”, and making the special regime laid down in the Convention, applicable to all vessels, of whatever nationality and whatever their port of origin, below a certain limit of tonnage (which would presumably be substantially below 500). It will be recalled that the Government of India pointed out an apparent conflict between Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and Article 22 of the Convention in respect of seven vessels, of less than 500 tons, based on Aden which, not being commanded by Indians are not affected by the Act of Brussels, but which, half the crew being Indian, fall within the class of native vessels of less than 500 tons, within the meaning of the Convention. As was stated in your letter of the 20th October, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the /then tw r Secretary of State,3^0 then circumstances, preferred to defer his observations on this matter. It appears, however, that if the proposal referred to in the opening sentence of this paragraph were adopted, the sphere of conflict between Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant gripping Act 1894 and Article 22 of the Convention would be extended to all vessels below the limit of tonnage decided upon and it seems necessary that the bearing of this result upon the proposed amendment of the Convention should be examined forthwith. Reference is invited as to this point to the letter from the Board of Trade to the Foreign Office No. C.R.T. 989/30 dated 30th June, 1930. I am also to invite the observations of the Foreign Offic upon paragraph 8 of the letter from the Government of India of the 13th September, 1930. The Government of India have pointed out a further difficulty arising out of Article 21 of the Convention, which requires all native vessels to carry manifests within the special zones. This provision could be enforced under the existing law, but the Government of India state that it would cause grave inconvenience owing tn the fact that it is Lascar ships owned by important Companies and managed by reputable Agents, which receive the concession of sailing without a manifest granted under Section 66 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 It seems possible that the amendment of the Convention with a view to the application of the special regime to all vessels below a certain tonnage might, if that tonnage were materially less than 500, mitigate the difficulty which the Government Ox India apprehend in this regard. The point has been referred to the Government of India in the telegram of to-day s date of which a copy is enclosed. /Copies/ Copies of ‘this lotter have been sent to the Board of Trade, the Admiralty and Colonial Office.

L/ITH’A’AITE. -TH.'j vCMLIiTiiiij had under consideration a Memorandum hy the Admiralty (D.C.(l)(32) 10) dealing with the question of supervision. MR. HOWARD SMITH asked il it was the Admiralty f s idea that the gist of their Paper should he worked into the Report which the Committee were proposing to make to the Ministerial Committee. He was not quite clear about certain; points. He understood that one of the chief objections of the Admiralty was the fact that whereas the Council of the League had to take a decision unanimously, the procedure for the body which the Bureau were suggesting would take a decision either by a two-thirds or a three-quarters majority. It seemed to him that it would not be possible to apply the machinery of the Council to the Convention in question because there were included a number of States who were not Members of the League of Nations. CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS said that as the matter was originally put to the Cabinet, it was understood that the body would consi of about 21 people, that is to say, the equivalent numbers of the Council plus the seven Powers who were not Members of the League. This was an extremely different proposition to the one now being considered, v/hich envisaged a Commission of 64 States. He did not think that this particular proposal had been before the Cabinet when they made their previous decision. He quite agreed that the Council, itself, could not take a decision, but the Admiralty would like to have some body which would be analogous to the Council. In a large Commission of 64 States there might quite easily be a minority of 16 under the majority procedure proposed, and it was even conceivable396 tha t this 16 might he the big States. COLONiCL DAWTTAY said that what, in fact, was being suggested was that Mr. Eden’s acceptance of the existing proposal in the Buieau ol the Conference should be rescinded* CAPTAIN DANCK'TERTS said that, put bluntly, that is what the Admiralty s proposals meant, but he understood that the report of the Bureau did not actually commit any country and,in consequence, we were not definitely committed to the procedure and therefore the question of rescission would not arise• he was anxious tnat the Cabinet should be informed ol the position so tnat they might say how far they were prepared to go in the direction of the Bureau's report. MR. HOV/ARD SMITH said that, in point of fact, the position \ was that the oabinet had had before them the original proposals under which the Council would be the governing body and the ... ^ (the Cabinet Admiralty now asked for a further decision as to whether they/ were prepared to agree to a different governing body acting on a majority vote, supposing, in fact, that this proposal eventually was confirmed which of course was not at all certain. At the present moment all that was implied was that the Bureau were trying to evolve something to give effect to the resolution of July 23rd. The results of the Bureau's deliberations might subsequently be found to be quite unworkable but if that was the Admiralty’s main point, he could see no abjection to including a suitable paragraph in the report. COLONEL DAWNAY said he thought there was a point in the Bureau's report to which special attention should be drawn, and he referred particularly to Section III, Means of Supervision, Paragraph 5, which reads as follows:-'At the request of one or more Members of the Commission acting in the name of their Governments, the Commission may decide to conduct local investigations. 'This decision, which will define the subject of the investigation, shall be taken by a two- thirds majority of the Members present at the meeting, abstentions being regarded as negative votes.' He was under the impression that Mr. Eden had made a reserva tion on the subject of this paragraph. ( NOTE. The Minutes of the meeting during which this section of the Report was discussed at Geneva were searched but no specific reservation by Mr. Eden could be found.) CAPTAIN BANCKWERTS said he thought the question of the complaint was such an important and such a dangerous matter that a decision should be unanimous. With a body composed of 64 States this would seem to be a practical impossibility. He wondered if it might not be possible far the commission of 64 9 say, to elect a smaller body to carry out the work* The Admiralty felt strongly that a body composed of 64 Members was not really a proper or competent body to deal with sc /ital a matter. MR. HOWARD SMITH agreed that this point of view should be put in the report. COLONEL BAWNAY wondered v/hether a solution on the lines of Article 15 of the Covenant of the League of Nations might not perhaps provide a procedure acceptable to the Admiralty. -*-he last paragraph of this Article read as follows:- 'In any case referred to the Assembly, all the provisions of this Article and of Artie e relating to the action and powers of the council shall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a report mace y ^ Assembly, if concurred in by the representatives of those Members of the League repre^enwe Council and a maiority ^f_th^tM^ League, exclusive in each case of r P , oo^e of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same force as a report by the Council concurred in by all the Members thereof other than the repr , f of one or more of the parties to the dispute.Under this Article it was clear that there was a precedent for a majority vote and it seemed to him that a solution which might not ce unacceptable might 'be found under a procedure 'by which a complaint was accepted with a two- thirds majority, of which the Council States must he unanimou and the other States have a majority. uAPTAIN yANCK./.oRTS said that this suggestion would certainly meet the Admiralty. £3 Llit. HO '.A.RD SMITH said that he thought the suggestion if/cio a very /aluctole one and should be included in the report COiTQhUSTQIT, It was agreed - to instruct the Secretary to draw up a report dealing with the question of supervision in accordance with the Minutes of the Meeting of the Committee held on November 24th, 1932, and the Minutes of the present meeting, the report to be circulated in draft form for consideration cy the Committee and finally to be forwarded to tbe Ministerial Committee for their consideration. PRIVATE AND STATE MANUFACTURE] 01' ARMS AND IMPLEMENTS CF VAR. (a; Copy of a letter from Mr. E.H. Carr (at Geneva) to Mr. C. Howard Smith, C.M.G., Foreign Office (D.C.(I)(32) 13). THE COMMITTEE first proceeded to consider a letter from • Parr asking for guidance urgently in connection with a meeting of the Committee on Manufacture of and Trade in Arms which would be held at Geneva on December 1st, 1932. MR. HOWARD SMITH said he would like, first of all, to tern to page 3 of Mr. Carr's letter and deal with the question c f zones because this was a question in which the India Office were particularly interested and after that there would be no ne ed to keep them further at the discussion. In the lastparagraph of his letter Mr. Carr said;- 5, My impression is that the feeling of the Committee will he against the maintenance of these special zones altogether, and in particular that I should ho almost alone if I had to insist on the maintenance of the Persian Gulf zone'. So far as the Foreign Office themselves were coriccrned 9 they wore prepared to see F , the special zones omitted. MR© BROMN said that 9 from the point of view of the Government of India, there were three aspects of this question of the special zones© The first was of a military character© the second of a political character, and the third of an economic character© As regards tho military point; it was in the interests of India that there should he a restriction of gun running in the Persian Gulf„ The situation had changed a good deal since the war because various factors had combined to male© it easier for tribes men and other people to procure .weapons, hut at the same time it could not he said that saturation point had been reached© regards actual capacity for the absorp tion of arms, the following figures were relevant. There were something like 450,OCC men of fighting stock on the north-west frontier of India .of which about 200,000 possessed modern rifles© It would therefore be seen that so far as the tribesmen were concerned, there was a con siderable margin 'between what they had and what they might get and the Government of India was still concerned therefore to see that access was not made too easy© would ask Mr© Laithwaite to deal with the political sideMRo IjAlLlf'JAlFh said that the question of control of arms txie traffic in/Persian Gulf and the possibility of a bilateral arms traffic a^neem^nt with Persia 5 had formed the subject of considerable discussion from time to time between the India Office and the Foreign Office, in point of fact the political case turned to a very large extent on the military factors outlined by Mr. Brown, At the moment the position was not really unsatisfactory. Naval vigilance, coupled with the fact that both the Persians and Ibn Gaud were anxious to keep arms traffic in their territories under control, had resulted in reducing it to negligible proportions. To that extent therefore re tention of the special zones was possibly of less importance. But the India Office had to consider the future and the fact that a relaxation of control might take place in those countries, the result of v/hich v/ould be to render the retention of the special zone arrangements of greater importance than at the memento He referred to the fact that the Government of India had taken strong exception to the classification of Indian and Burman vessels as native ships and enquired whether the abolition of special zones v/ould mean automatically the abolition of the definition native ships*, CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS intervened to remark that he was quite certain this was so, MR. LAITHWAITE continuing, said he presumed also that if a general convention was concluded at Geneva, to which both Persia and ourselves were parties, there would be no objection to our supplementing this general convention with a bilateral Anglo-Persian regional agreement in respect of the Persian Gulf area. Ill .—'A- * -6-Mr that th MB ft to t agreeme incline the obs satisfi abandon CA like th obvious however this me As a ma his cor convent Persian If ther would b because Moreove running and alt conditj cloak 1 anythin our ant extreme MI r ‘ e gardj abuse 1 under £m r. WARNER thought there would he no objection at all, provided that the regional agreement was in line with the general agreement 0 MR. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office were not optimistic to the prospects of any satisfactory bilateral arms traffic agreement with Persia, and that he thought the Foreign Office were inclined to share their view. Ke thought however that subject to the observations of the Government of India if the Admiralty were satisfied that the special zone arrangements could safely be abandoned the India Office would bo prepared to accept their view. CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS said that the Admiralty did not very much like the idea of having a special treaty with Persia, because obviously there would be reactions outside the Persian Gulf. This, however, should not be regarded as an insuperable objection if by this means it might be possible to get an agreement on general grounds. As a matter of fact, he thought the Persian representative was basing his contentions on a misapprehension. In point of fact, the convention would not apply either to the land area of Persia or to Persian territorial waters, but it would only apply on the high seas. If there was going to be a general abolition of zones, he thought it would be more dangerous in the Red Sea than in the Persian Gulf, because most of the gun running took place in that area nowadays. Moreover, a good deal of the control which we exercised over gun running was carried out in co-operation with anti-slavery operations, and although we had no specific right to search for arms under these conditions, in point of fact anti-slavery operations were use.! as a cloak to carry out investigations regarding smuggling of arms, and anything which affected this procedure might react unfavouraoly on °nr anti-slavery operations. He thought that we should need to be extremely careful what we did. MR. WARNER said that if the provisions of the 1925 Convention regarding special zones came into force, Persia would be likely to a ^use the right which it would confer on her to search Arab vessels ^n^er 500 tons in the Persian Gulfo4o2 CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS said he did not think this was actually so as no right of search was implied in the convention. Powers were ^given only to identify vessels, and in cases of suspicion, to take them to the nearest port of the country whose flag the vessel was flying and leave them there for the shore authorities to deal with. MR, WARNER said that at the present moment the Persian Govern ment had no right to interfere with the shipping of the Arab State in the Persian Gulf, which were in special treaty relations with Kis Majesty's Government. The Foreign Office saw objection to any procedure which would give Persia excuse, if not authority, for such action. The special zone provisions, if agreed to by Persia would give Persian warships the right to ’'inspect” such vessels in uhe .ersian Gulf. On the other hand, since it appeared that the Persian Government were very unlikely to accede to any convention containing the 'special zone' provisions of the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention and Mr* Carr reported.that the general feeling on the Committee at Geneva was against the maintenance of the special zone provisions and since the position at the present moment could not he considered altogether unsatisfactory, the Foreign Office felt that unless there were strong reasons for pressing for the mainten ance of the special zone provisions, then it might well be best to acquiesce in their being dropped. oAPTAIN DANCKWERTS said that so far as the Persian Gulf was concerned, the position had been fairly satisfactory for some years. MR. LAITKWAITS enquired whether, supposing the special zone Proposal was abandoned, no arms traffic convention came into e xistence and it was not possible to negotiate a satisfactory bilateral arms traffic agreement with Persia, the Admiralty consid- er&gt;e d that the traffic could be Heft effectively under control in the Arslan Gulf purely by exercising our existing treaty powers and maintaining our existing practice as regards search of Arab vessels 0n the high seas?4o3 CAPTAIN DANCKWEETS said that the Admiralty thought our present success was chiefly due to the position on land in that the deaire to run arms was not very strong, that is to say, the present satisfactory position was not due to any naval action, hut rather to conditions on shore* ±f there should oe a recrudescence of a desire to run arms, then the situation might he different, and it would certainly not he anything like so satisfactory, because our present powers were extremely limited; in fact, if there was real determination to trade in arms, he doubted if we could stop it. MRo TURNER said that India had refused to ratify the Convention on grounds very similar to Persia. India disliked intensely the proposal to call all her ships 'native vessels', and to apply the right of stopping vessels to vessels of Indian nationality when others were exempt. There were other objections of a technical kind vdiich, however, might not prove insuperable on further examination. CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS said he thought also that one of the chief reasons for the cessation of running was that the gun runners imagined that we had far greater powers than in fact we actually had, in other words, gun running had been stopped partly by bluffo ItfR. WARNER remarked that if this was the case, a strong argument was provided for leaving things alone. CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS agreed, and said that the Admiralty would much prefer that things should be left as at present. MR. HOWARD SMITH said in that case he presumed there would be no objection to the zone proposal being4o4- abandoned so far as the Gulf was concerned, as there was no chance of the Convention coming into force. CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS said he ^as not at all sure about the position in the Red Sea, but he believed that gun running ^as more prevalent in this area. MR. WARNER said that apart from the special question of the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the special zones, he thought the special zone provisions would be valuable, if they could be got through; but since it was probable that the inclusion of these zones had had a great deal to do with the Convention not being ratified, v^as it worth while standing out for them, in the event of strong opposition on the C ommit te e u MR. HOWARD SMITH, in r eply to a question from Mr. Bernes, said he understood that we were only in a minority of one in regard to the Persian Gulf zone. It seemed to him that if a general disarmament convention was concluded at all, there would be a very strong feeling that everything should be done to put down gun running, and that it night, in fact, lead to a number of special agreements particularly designed to stop this form of traffic. It seemed to him possible, in view of the particular national interests at stake, the Bureau might feel a little awkward in discussing matters raised in this Convention; in any case, the Convention had not come into force. CAPTAIN DANCKWERT3 agreed, but pointed out that the whole idea was to produce another convention. UR. s.K. BROWN remarked that one of the risks he felt might arise at Geneva was that countries might assume that all treaties would he put into the nelting pot. MS. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office did not contemplate, cr in the least desire, that any of our existing treaties with the Arab Chieftains or the Firman should be scrapped, or our present practice as regards search of Arab vessels modified. -10-4o&lt;r HR* WARNER referred to the understanding vttiich had “been reached between ourselves, the French, Italian, Japanese and Belgian Governments to put the special zone provisions of the 1919 Convention into force as between themselves- Would it be possible to continue on those lines, and make further agreements with individual States or groups of States, since the general conclusion was that the present position was not too bad? He thought that Ibn Said would take up the same position as Persia* He would certainly want to keep the question of importation in his own hands, and therefore be in favour of control, but he would not be likely to agree to the inclusion of his territory in any special zone. He was not at all sure that the best plan might not be to try to keep going on existing lines, and not to try and stand out for the inclusion of special zones if there was no chance of their being accepted. CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS remarked that the Admiralty were really servants in this matter, and that if the general opinion was that it would be possible to carry on effectively without these zones, then they would fall into line • MR. TURNER asked what would be left if the special zones had gone* 7/ould there still be any need to classify ships as ’’native vessels”? CAPTAIN DANCKWERTS said he understood not; this particular phraseology was only applicable in special zones. MR, LAITHWAITE said that subject to confirmation by the Government of India, he thought that if the Adairalty were satisfied that in practice no real difference would he made hy their aholition, there would he no need to press for the retention of special zones from the point of view of the India Office, so long, that was, as it was clearlyunderstood, that existing treaties would remain in ferre ; together ^i-~h the right of seareh. MB. HOV/.'RD SMITH suggested that it was perhaps difficult to get a definite answer at the present moment ? particularly since the Government of India must ho consulted. He would he very grateful if Mr. Warner and representatives of the India Office and the .Admiralty would confer together regarding the sending of a telegram to India, and would inform him of their proposals so that he could telegraph to Mr. Carr today, to give him material with which to hold the fort until the Government of India reply was rec eived. CONCLUSION. It was agreed that Mr. Warner of the Foreign Office, and a representative of the India Office and the Admiralty should confer together with regard to the proposal to abolish special zones* and that they should arrange for a telegram oo he oent to the Government of India asking for their viewo on this matter as early as possicle, and that the result of their consultation should he . communicated to the Chairman so that he might he in a position to advise Mr. Carr as to ^ne line he could take pending the reply of the Government of India.

HOWARD SMITH said he thought there was general agreement as to the method to be followed in answering the questionnaire, but before proceeding to consider details there w r ere two points in the Admiralty paper which he would like to raise. First of all, on page 4 in paragraph 2 the Admiralty said 'it is not clear to them whether in fact information is required as to the sales of total output or to the sales cf total output of armaments'. It seemed to him that as this was a questionnaire on armaments, it could only mean 'total output of armaments .' SIR REGINALD TOWNSEND asked what was meant by the phrase 'total output,' Did it include subsidy, new manufacture, repairs, or what? MR. HOWARD SMITH said it seemed to him that it was obviously intended to mean new work only. COLON:xl LAWNAY agreed, MR. BROWL'TT said he thought that the point was cleared up if Categories I, II, III and IV of the draft Convention were studied.MR. MaciVER said that we could answer Question 1, i o a ■&gt; &gt; t, Rqr_t^j2UTjtoses_o^_t,he manufa cture o-r arms §—P-1 — dfLvlj—1-S. a spe cial permit required 9 If so , please p;iv e partic ulars. ,T ~ J:L - hy reference to the relevant Sections of the Firearms Act, 1920* Under this Act, any person manufacturing arms was required to register with the police as a firearms dealer and to keep a register of transactions which would be open for inspection by the local police (vide Section 2, sub-paragraphs (l) and (6), Section 8 and the Second Schedule of the Firearms Act). Also Section 6 of the Act provides as follows 'It shall not be lawful for any person without the authoruty of the Admiralty, or the Army Council or the Air Council to manufacture, purchase, sell, carry, or have in his possession any weapon of whatever description designed for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas, or other thing, or any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to contain any such noxious thing, and such a weapon is under this Act referred to as prohibited.' CAPTAIN DANCKWFRTS said that the position seemed to him to be that we have not really anything like the supervision inside the country which we were actually inclined to make out, but we did keep a very tight hold on anything which was exported. MR. HOWARD SMITH said that from what had gone before it seemed, to him that the answer to Question 1 was in the negative.MR. MacIVER said hs thought that we could hardly return such an answer* hut that we should say 'Yes' and quote the provisions showing that they were, in fact, rather limited. MR. BARNES remarked that in the case of certain arms and implements of war, he thought further restriction was required before an affirmative reply could he given. MR. HOWARD SMITH asked Mr. Maclver if he would he gcod enough to produce a draft of an answer to Question 1 on the lines of Sections 2, 6, and 8 of the Firearms Act, 1920, and also the A.rms Export Prohibit ion Order, 1931. MR. BROWETT added that another point in our favour which might he well worth remembering 7 /as that we did not use our Export Credits Guarantee for the export of armaments. MR. BARNES said that reference should also he made to the Treaties of Washington Act, 1922, and the London Naval Treaty Act, 19o0. MR, HOWARD SMITH said that in point of fact the idea apparently was not to attempt to give a direct answer to Question 1, hut rather to state facts.- ■ i,imiw«.w i-j. n Quest 2 of Questionnaire. ’' vmat__undc rtax ciiy G in the terrijbor^ under the jurisdicti on of ygi it Sta te are c hieily or lamel y engaged in the na nufactiij^_qf_article 3 coming, unde r Cat e^ ri es I, II 6 m an d TV nf _the..l?29^ draf t Go nyeiition wit h re,o:a rd t o t he Buper vi sj. on o f the manufactiir e of _am 3 and innl ernent s of war? a^ Are they State-oYv’nod h) or are they exploited subsidised under concession or under supervision by the State?

HO’IAPD SMITH said that his so com point y/’as raised on page paragraph 3 of the Admiralty letter* Here it v/as said 'it is suggested that Category IIl(l) be inter preted to include only Urns who would act as main contractors for building warships, since if sub-contractors for component parts of warships were included it is thought that an enomous number of firms would have to be mentioned and discrimination would be a matter of great difficulty'. If the Admiralty suggestion,, which seemed unite reasonable 5 was accepted; he thought there should be mention made by us of the fact that there were sub-contractors. It was important that we should not lay ourselves open to any charge of concealing information. he v/ould be grateful if the Board of Trade could help in regard to this question, MR. STAHLEY said that the only information the Board of Trade possessed came from the census of Production which* he would remind the Committee* was not held annually or in fact at any regular interval. The Board of irade collected information from all the private and State—owned firms* and the information thus procured foil owed; moie 01 less* he thought* the lines required by the questionnaire. - 16 - e^ - T - -17- I'll Ther^ was an important point 5 however 5 in that the statute Board of Trane wore prohibited by / from disclosing in the information they published the identity of any of the firms. It was not possible, therefore, to publish complete and full information. The information actually issued was in the form of a general summary under various headings. The last census of production had been made in 1950 and it extended to all firms except those employing less than ten persons. As regards State-owned factories, the Board of Trade had got full returns for 1930, but they had to be guided by the Service Departments in regard to the degree of detail to be published,, CAPTAIN DANGKV/ERTS said that the trouble was that there wore practically no firms which were wholly engaged in the manufacture of arms under Categories I, II 5 III and IV, and therefore logically our answer to thin question should be n No ,r . However, he thought tnat in point of fact we must interpret this question widely and include firms who were making what might be considered a reasonable proportion of armaments c MR. BARNES said that they had made this suggestion in their letter on page 3 under pax'agraph MR. HOWARD SMITH asked whether this proposal acceptable to the Board of Trade. MR. BROWETT suggested boat as a matter of x act he thought this was really more a question for the Servi.ce Departments to answer. He thought it the three Service Departments produced be owe^n them composite list, then practically all firms would be covered; if there were any others tney ojuui no doubt be picked up from the Department of Overseas Trade. Furthermore, as had already been stated, underthe rules governing the Census of Production the Board of Trade were precluded f ro , : g ivlng the n£ales of any firms, MR* FENNELLY said that the Board of Trade couldp of course* make up a list of firms from their general knowledge which would probably be family accurate, but they could not in any circum stances use information which they had collected for the Census of Production© LxR, JOrvARD SMITH asked whether the information could be obtained by asking the films contributing to the Census of Production if they agreed to their names being published,, MR© FENNELLY said he presumed that this could be done, but it would involve an enormous amount of labouro MR# BOVENOCHEN said that from the War Office point of view he really thought this question was an impossible one to answer. Any engineering firm in the countiv was capable of armament work, and, in point of fact it was War Office policy to try and increase the number of firms who would take on armament work as much as possible© SIR REGINALD TOWNSEND remarked that the number of firms involved was between 10*000 and l2,000 o MR© HOWARD SMITH said he gathered that the War Office would like the answer to this question to be that from our point of view it v/'as quite impossible to provide the information required© On the other hand*-19- ' J ^v- 4IS we could, he supposed, 'write and say that we would, in view of the difficulties of answering this question^ nice furthor precision as to what information exactly was required. GROUP CAPTAIN RABINGTON said that the whole of our efforts at Geneva had been aimed at preventing too much precision. He suggested that we should make it quxte clear that we could not answer the question with-any .decree, of accuracy, For example, the Air Ministry might buy from Rolls Royce this year, but next year they might not give them a contract at all. He thought that difficulties of this kind ought to be brought out clearly now. He would also remind the Committee that lying behind this questionnaire were far wider issues, such for example as the internationalisation of armament production. He felt it extremely important that we should emphasise particularly our difficulties in answering this questionnaire. SIR REGINALD TOWNSEND wished to know how, when answering this question, it was proposed to deal with the question of substances like chlorine, T.N.T. , gunpowder, etc, and whether a line was to be drawn between armaments and commerce, CAPTAIN DkNCKWERTS sc id perhaps the reply could be started with some phrase indicating that we possessed no armament firms but there were a number of firms who made armaments 0 SIR REGINALD TOWNSEND wanted to know whether this questionnaire was meant to deal with capacity or manufacture.COLONEL LAW NAY thought that our Lest plan would be to give a general statement in y/hich we v^ould describe the conditions in this country and state that in view of these conditions it was not possible* v/ith the best will in the world, to give a definite answer to Question 2. He thought if we could frame a general statement of this kind then the ansy^ers to Question 3 would not arise at all 0 1,{R 0 BARNES agreed but asked what in that case became of our claim to control and supervise the manufacture of arms end implements of Y^ar in this country*, MR* HOWARD SMITH agreed this made the position rather av/kward» MR, BARNES wondered vfhether v/e could rely on the legal position of the Board ox Trade to avoid making answers to this question® M2. BEOTOTT suggested that the hect answer TOUld he a short explanation of our position.

CAPTAIN DANCKtTEETS said that there were also certain State factories which would have to te mentions: SIE REGINALD TOTNSEKD said he presumed that only those actually manufacturing were to be given. There Wer ' o0 ' 1 '' ^^ctories on a care and maintenance basis and others which had been sold to private firms which would revert on the outbreak of war. HOWARD SKITH said he thought it was clear that information could only he given in regard to those who were in production between 1927 and 1931 , he then asked vdiaz answer 5 if any, it was suggested should.be given to (b) of Question 2. hk. hARNSS said that (b) and (c) obviously did not arise in the case of State factories. ivlho BRO'TETT suggested that if we answered the question in the general way he had proposed it would hardly do necessary to deed with these sub-heads. He thought they could be worked in to the general answer, and suggested a phrase on the following lines 'Ordersare placed under varying conditions of contract existing with the three Fighting Services n .

BROTOTT suggested that we should give the published Census of Production figures in answer to this Question, These figures were published and could oe bought by anybody at the Stationery Office and were, therefore, available even if we did not produce them ourselves. In reply to a question from Captain Danckwerts, he said it would be quite possible to distinguish between foreign and home distribution. MR. PATERSON, in answer to various questions, said that no distribution was made to foreign countries by State factories. The only trazhic tnexe wa^ existed between this country and the Dominions end India,remarked that in that case it might he sufficient if we said that no distrihution was made to foreign markets, hut only to the Dominions. Mf. BARIiES remarked that as a matter of fact we did actually sell certain surplus things to foreign governments. GROUP CAPTAIN BABINOTON suggested that we should give value only and not weight* MR. FENNELLY said that in view of the fact that both value and weight were circulated in a public document he thought it would he better policy to comply Ydth the instruct- ions and give ‘both* MR. BROWTT agreed and proposed that we should go as far hut no farther than, information given in the published document. MR. HOWARD cMITII asked Mr. Biwett if he would be good enough to work out an answer to Question 3 giving information which Y/as published by the Stationery Office, and Yfould forward this information to the Secretary. MR© BROWETT said that so far as State-owned factories were corrernedj information was produced with the approval of the Service Departments. He reiterated that he thought we should confine ourselves to infomation which we usually published to the wo rid a MB. BO YENS CHEN remarked that if we were proposing to give figures for the trade we might be asked to give similar information for factories, end we were particularly anxious to avoid giving any weight figures for factorieso He also asked whether^ if we gave information as to output from the trade, we could refuse to give the names of the firms on whose returns the output figures were based. Did the Statutory Prohibition, to which the Board of Trade had referred^ prevent them publishing names, if details could not thereby be identified? MR. PATERS OH said he thought we should make it quite4(2 clear that our factories wore concerned onl:^ with production for the United Kingdom and the dependencies and Indie.« SIR REGIR&amp;LI) T07NSEITD ashed whether repairs were supposed to he included.

HOWARD SMITH said that there was one question on which he would he glad of the advice of the Committee before it broke up„ Mr« Carr had particularly asked for information which would enable him to deal with the proposal to introduce an international licensing system for all manufacture of and trade in arms. MR. BROWETT said that he entirely agreed with tho point of view of the Admiralty that there was implied in this proposal a system of inspection which public opinion in this country would never tolerate. MR. MacIVER suggested that in order to help Mr. Carr he might, if the Committee agreed, produce a short note on the operation of the Firearms Act, 1920, which Mr. Carr could use to explain our proposal that licensing should be on a national basis. MR. BARITES suggested that he should also have the Arms Export Prohibition Order-in-Counci1 which would show the very tight control we kept on tho export of all armaments from this country. MR. BROWETT said ho thought mention should also be made of the fact that our Export Credits Guarantee did not include any armaments. MR. MaoTVER said that at the present moment the only Inspection in this country was the police inspection of registers and the inspections of premises carried out by Factory and Explosives Inspectors from the point of view of safety. Obviously any proposal of the kind referred State inspectors and would require to above would involve42o MR. BARNES said the real thing that mattered was obviously a question of export and we had complete powers under the Order-in-Council to keep the very tightest control on this side of the question. CONCLUSIONS. It was agreed - \&amp;) that a system of registration of manufacturers coupled with s comprehensive system of export regulations is considered to he an adequate means of supervision* that any extensive system of licences to manufacture would require highly con tentious legislation and would necessitate a largo and expensive staff of inspectors; that any system of international licensing would require legislation in this country so contentious as to make it inadraissablej (b) that Mr. Carr should 'be given a short note on the Firearms Act, 1920, which Mr. Maclver promised to supply; that he should also he given a copy of the Arms Export Prohibition Order, 1931, and should further he told to quote the fact that wo do not use our Export Crodits scheme in connection with armaments of any kind.

Of the Persian OOTernaent to th* Inclotion of the Persian aulf and fhilf of r a&amp;n. There seems no objection in the present circumstances to attacking the Persian Oovemaent’s standpoint and pressing the &amp;tteck y since their recent action in cancelling the nglo-'ersian Oil Company Concession appears to »*kc It quite unnecessary for His Kajesty's GwerMent at the present moment to pay undue heed to Persia* susceptibilities 5. In regard, however, to point 4 of the Persian Government f s objections, via, the Special Zone provisions regarding 'native vessels', the following special point arises. The Government of India have hitherto expressed s strong objection to the indue ion of Indian vessels under the heading of 'native vessels’. You will see fro* the enclosed India Office telegram that it has been suggested that the difficulty might be overcome by applying the special maritime *one provisions to all vessels below a fixed tonnage, which the Adalralty think might be less than the present figure of 600 tons without the purpose of the provisions being stultified. Apart, however, from the oovernment of India’s views on this point the suggestion must be further explored her© by the Admiralty in consultation with the oard of Trade, before you could mention it in the Committee? but the matter is being pressed on with. 6 . You will see that the Government of India have been asked to repeat to Geneva their reply to the India Office telegram; but the India Office ask me to say that if the Government of India do not concur with the views expressed in the telegram, they should not be taken as the last word on the subject without confirmation from here.424 w# hfeve ruleed with thm other Oeptrtmente the question 0 f u secortl li» e of defence f BUppoeing that the proposal to atlntuln ell the special eone provleione meete with strong opposition in the Committee. The a dmirtilty are considering urgently the question whether it eould be best to try for the maintenance of special aones with the exclusion of the &gt;erei*n Cftilf »nd the Oulf of t&lt;aon therefromj you will see that the point has been raised with the Coaaander in Chief, $t st Indies. On the whole, however, they feel at present th*t it would be best to maintain our view intact In the Committee and to try to have that view and the opposing one both set out in the report to the bureau. 6. T should perhaps add a word of explanation on the point mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 4 of the India Office tcltgrua. As matters are at present, and if the special none provisions are dropped, iersian warships have no right to atop Arab dhowj from the Trucial iiheikdoms, Bahrein, Koweit, and l-uscat, which are in special trealjr relations with His Majesty*s Government. The special zone provisions, as they stand at present, if acceded to by Persia, would give her warships tht t right, and they would not be alow to i«v&lt;.,il the&amp;aelves of the excuse ior intensive interference of a high-handed nature with such shipping. the new ersian Navy has now arrived in the &gt;ulf, thia aspect of the question is one to which we and the Indl&amp; tfice attach some Importance; but we should probably be guided largely by the lovemmcnt of India’s views on the point. If, as it appears, the Persian Government are very unlikely to accede to any eneciiil zone provisions which cover the e.alan ul (they/(they could preauatbly aeJee » reserve on the point when ratifying any final instrument, which emerges from the conference) the risk of Areh dhowe becoming liable to ^ j n terference from the Perelton nevy seems remotes 9 # These provisional views sre, I eat afraid, all I ean plve yo« ^ or the moment. Ye shall let you have any further information possible on the doubtful points as soon as may be. You will see f however, that the general conclusion Is that it would be well If a strong effort were made to inauce the Committee to adopt the special sone provisions in toto . on the ground that to drop the® would be directly contrary to the general sins of the dsarmament Conference, that the Persian position should be strongly attacked on the lines of paragraphs b and 6 of the admiralty note (with the caveat mentioned in paragraph 5 above regarding paragraph b(IV) of that note as to the modification of the 'native vessel* 4 provisions). It is also suggested that a good point could be made out of paragraph 3 of the admiralty note regarding the effect on the slave traffic of abandoning the special son© provisions. ($d) C.F.A.

This is insufficient to prevent the traffic in arms in these areas. 2. It is true that the Convention is not in force, but nevertheless we are at present acting in those areas as if the Convention were in force, and by custom we are even searching native vessels, which is a right the Convention does not propose to give. Our legal basis is extremely sketchy and it is considered that if the special sones were abolished, or if it were to be announced that they wouild not be included in a future treaty, our present methods could not be maintained. Moreover, the weakness of our legal basis would be so patently exposed that an encouragement would be offered to the resumption of illegal arms traffic. 3. It is also considered that the abolition of special zones for arms traffic would have a serious re-action on the ave traffic. The maritime areas in which the slave traflic is rried on are roughly the same as those in which *e . s affic is attempted, and the measures we take for the ppression of one are indissolubly bound up with t^ose we take r the suppression of the other. 4. It is suggested therefore that T. Carr should &gt;omt out that without either the continuance of special zones, or the extension to the whole world of the regulations to be preoc for these zones, no maritime supervision could oe e* e Experience extending up to the present day shows that a supervision in these special zones is essential to control the traffic in arms.- 2 - 44 ° 5. The following omarks are made with reference to the Persian objeetione ae set out in league Document C.414.M.170. 1931 IX, dated 12th June 1931. I. This objection now falls to the ground, since 'manufacture- is now being dealt with as well as 'traffic'. XI. Since the League has no maritime police or forces it is necessary for the league to entrust maritime supervision to the High Contracting powers. Ill* The Persian Gulf is one of the areas in which, on account of the state of development of sorae f the countries bordering on c it, illegal traffic in arms takes place end must be checked. The maritime special zone does not Include the territorial waters of Persia or any other pov/er. This can be made clear in the revision of the Convention. IV. Small native vessels are in fact the vessels in which attempts to smuggle arms are made. Supervision of large vessels which might carry arms from the country of manufacture can be carried out by the authorities of that co jntry before departure, if necessary the definition of native vessels can )C be made to exclude Persian vessels, though this is likely to lead to Increased illegal arms traffic under shelter of the Persian flag. V* propose a voluntary agreement between the High Contracting Powers to ensure oo mon action in this important matter. These regulations should be welcomed by Persia who presumably does not desire that illicit arras traders should shelter under the Persian flag* 6. Finally V. Carr might attack Persia and point out that her objections are apparently designed to hamper the v/or of controlling the traffic in i rms end render it impossible. any years experience have taught thie country that the proposed measures .......zxir - 3 - measures far from being too drastic in this area fall short of what is really necessary to ensure that this illegal traffic should he stamped out# 7. It is fot consideration whether ur. carr should make any reference to slWe traffic. Probably \t would be weak to base any arguments on arms traffic on the parallel case of slare traffic which is not at present under consideration. 1/ik'uIa ognat, miT^HALL, S.W. 1. 29ta HuYviuDar 1932 fcy dear lamer, I enclose a fair copy of the draft 1 sent you (there am one or t»o verbal au-ano^ente) am ,1bo of the redraft which Danclcwerta suggested by telepitone, which iaay be useful at tiie aiscuBslon tomorrow. on a Bilnor point, &amp;e you will see from paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Amo fraffic o.e^jorai aw in r,G. 13, we seem to have a specific authority for the search of Arab vessels on tne high .leas only In the case of Auscat.

Dear Danclcwerts, For convenience I enclose a fair copy of the uraft I sent over to you this afternoon ana also of the formula you suggested by telephone. They may help in our aiecussion at 3.30 tomorrow afternoon. On a minor point, as you will see from paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Arms Traffic MemonaidiBn in F.G. 13, we seem to have a specific authority for the search of ^rab vessels on the High Seas only in the case of j.uscat. if ana when we search Arab vessels belonging to other sheikhdoms we do so really on the strength of our special position in the States concerned, the rulers of all of which have given an undertaking to prohibit the traffic in ams in their territories. But as it is a question of practice rather than of strict law, the reference in paragraph of/ ^hih Uanckwerts •humimlty. &gt; H.N., 1of the draft telegram to ’existing treaties* with the Arab rfulers would need some modification in the event of our discussions tomorrow resulting 1 c consultation with India. Yours sincerely, J.G. .r~. r * *■ . xr ^ ♦ 7 m Redraft s ti^gested by tslejiione by Captain DancKwerts. Ttie iidmlraity consider that though at present there is little activity in gun-running in tne Persian Gulf yet the abandonment of Special Zones by all nations would make It apparent that no maritime supervision would In future be exercised* This might lead to a revival of gun-running. Under these conditions Admiralty powers would be limited to the search of vessels In Arab or Indian territorial waters and on the high seas of vessels belonging to such Arab Sheikhdoms as have agreed to that procedure. They do not feel that with these limited powers they would be able to prevent revived of gun-running.! Mr. Walton, Unaer Secretary of State, ihd present position as regards the ■ application oi international regulation of arms traffic in the Persian Gull is set out in paras.4-7 of the Memorandum attached. The Convention of 1925 ; (still inoperative) provides (Chapter III p.16) for 1 tlie establishment of certain special zones (including the Persian Gull and the Ped Sea) within which a special procedure is to he applied by the H.C.P. to 32 cneck the trade, ana for the application of further restrictions to vessels under 500 tons defined as 'native vessels', as defined in Article 20 (p.22). That definition covers Indian and Burman vessels. The Government of India, while in favour of applying special restrictions to Persia, etc v object to India and Bunna being placed in the same category, and so have never ratified the Convention. Persia takes a similar stand in respect of the Gulf. The Convention has been under consideration &amp;t Geneva in connection with the Disarmament Conference. 'The British representative (Mr. E.H. Carr of the Foreign Office) reported on 23rd November that general opposition to 'special zones' might be anticipated, and that as regards the Persian Gulf zone in particular he expected to be in a minority of one, and asked for instructions as to the line to be taken. The question ms considered this morning at an official sub Committee of the C.I.D. Mr. 3.K.Brown, Mr. W.H. Turner, and I represented the India Office. Foreim Office favoured abandonment of the special zones if there was opposition. Their jtelention was likely/! likely to militate against any general acceptance ot an Anns Traffic Convention, ana seemed unlikely, l| ;|| particularly in the Persian Gulf, to make any | substantial difference. Moreover, if Persia were to accede to the proposal for Zones, ana so acquire a : right to ,, inspect rt Arab shipping, the results might be very embarrassing. Admiralty disliked abandonment, but took the line that the real safeguard at the moment ms the absence of a market for arms owing to postwar semi-saturation. We should find it very difficult effectively to prevent the traffic even under a 'special zone' arrangement, ana it was unliKely, in any event , that the absence of such an arrangement would make much difference in the Persian Gulf, it was however essential that we shoula retain our existing, treaty rights of control ana search in that area. The In^ia office representatives indicated tnat so far as Inaia proper was concerned the Government of India might welcome abolition of •special zones' in so far as it involved also the abolition of the category of 'native vessels'; that in the Persian Gulf matters were at the moment much easier thanks to naval vigilance, saturation, and Persian anxiety to control arms traffic through Pers: tut that we had to look to the future, and abandon nothing now which we might regret later, subject to the Government of India's views, however, the Admiralty attitude be in 2 ; aq Q+-t - ~ -^6 as stated above, it looked a tnough we should stand to lose little in practice by oning^ special zones, and the Foreign Office poin out the rights of search which Persia might acquire m 3 uch zones if she acceded to the Convention was important.

INDIA OFFICE B. 410. Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf, 1908-1928. Introductory. 1. The Foreign Cilice (Supplementary) Memorandum of 1908 deals with the earlier history of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. At the date of that Memorandum the States, other than Muscat, bordering on the Gulf, had declared the trade illegal, or had agreed with His Majesty’&amp; Government for its suppression. The absence of any restrictions on the import and export of arms from Muscat, which was prevented from imposing restrictions by its treaties vyith foreign Powers, had, however, led to the concentration of the traffic in that State, and so to a situation which the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government, vitally interested in checking the flow of modern arms of precision to Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier of India, regarded with the utmost gravity. 2. The period now under review is marked by the conclusion of arrangements which have effectively curbed the arms traffic in Muscat and by the reduction to insignificant dimensions of that traffic in the Gulf as a whole. The present Memorandum proposes briefly to set out the treaty engagements and agreements concluded on the subject between His Majesty’s Government and the States bordering on the Gulf, and, after a reference to the Arms Traffic Conventions of 1919 and 1925, to refer to the more important developments in the Gulf between 1908 and 1928 in connection with the suppression of the trade in arms. Treaty Engagements, &amp;c., of States bordering on the Persian Gulf. 3. With the exception of the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, the rulers whose States border on the Persian Gulf at the present date are bound by treaty or agreement to prohibit and suppress the arms traffic in their territories. The import of arms into Persia was prohibited by the Shah in 1881, and again in 1900. In 1897 Her Majesty’s Government secured from the Persian Government a firman, under which the Shah empowered Her Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf to examine and search all merchant vessels in the Persian Gulf and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms found on board. This firman remains in force. On the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the Sheikh of Bahrein agreed in 1898 to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory ; the Sheikh of Koweit gave a similar undertaking in 1900, as did the 'Trucial Chiefs in 1902. The import of arms into Turkey (and so, up to 1914, into El Hasa and El Katr) was prohibited in 1802 ; and the Sheikh of El Katr, under his treat &gt; y with His Majesty’s Government of 3rd November 1916, undertook the same obligations in the matter as the other Trucial Chiefs. By a Proclamation of 1898, the Sultan of Muscat, who in 1881 had prohibited the import of arms at Gwadur, his dependency on the Makran coast, authorised British and Persian war vessels to search British, Muscat, or Persian vessels for arms in Muscat waters, as well as Muscat vessels in Indian and Persian waters, and to confiscate arms and ammunition intended for Indian or Persian ports. In 1903 he empowered British ’(and Italian) vessels to search Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms on the high seas; and in 1912 an agreement was reached with His Highness by His Majesty’s Government lor the establishment in his State of a warehouse regime, the result of which has been to dispose of the Muscat arms traffic as a serious issue. Ibn Sand alone of the rulers whose States border on the Gulf remains unlettered by any agreement in the matter. The Arms Traffic Conventions of 1919 and 1925. 4. Save in the case of the Sheikh of El Katr, the engagements iofeired to in the preceding paragraph had been concluded before the EuiopeanGulf, to enter mto any detailed account of the discussions which t ] i U Suffice it to say that consequent on them the matter was taken 0 ' ^ ^ pressed by His Majesty’s Government on the conclusion of the VJ? ^ that, on ^Oth September 1919, an Arms Traffic Convention was n a ’ an( ! and signed at St. Germain-en-Laye by the Allied Powers other j/ &gt;i)rov ^ United States of America, and by a number of the Powers assnoi ! i with them. ‘ b0Cla tea 5.

But the question was too important to he allowed to dmn and September 1923 the T emporary Commission on Annaments was invfted by the League of Nations to examine it further and to consider the nrepamti™ of an International Convention likely to meet with general acceptance The an 8 !tm Traffic Pon/* 0113 ' he hoIdi ' lg at Gene ^ a 111 »925 of nk,-'l- k° nfere “ Ce : vh,ch dr( ''’ l, P a revised Convention.

For dealing with th^ arm - tr 11 Majesty’s Government endeavour, in the arms trade, to he guided so far as possible by the spirit ofV *r the Convention, the binding mstrumeuts, so far as the Persian Gulf is concerned, are the treaty engagements and other Agreements referred to in para. 3 above. Arms Traffic in the Gulf, 1908-1928. (a) 1908-1919. 8. The question of most importance during this period is the suppression ~ 1012, of the arms traffic from Muscat The history of this question, and of the successful elioits made by His Majesty’s Government to establish control over the 1S . given in paras. 7 to 1G of the Memorandum on Muscat on page g, and it is not proposed to deal with it in detail here. Suffice it to say that, after lengthy negotiation, an arrangement was reached with the Sultan in May 1912, under which His Highness, in return for •certain considerations, and for the payment of certain compensation, agreed to establish in his State a bonded warehouse under efficient control, to be in charge of a trustworthy person from among his subjects, in which all arms aud ammunition should be deposited on importation. Issues from the warehouse were to be regulated by licences prepared by the Superintendent and countersigned by the Sultan personally, and such licences were to be issued only to individual purchasers or their authorised agents, subject to satisfactory proof that the issue involved was free from justifiable objection, aud were not to be issuable to traders. After long diplomatic discussions, the regulations in question were recognised by the French Government in February 1914, and from that date the arms traffic in Muscat—save possibly in certain areas of the Batineh coast, on which the Sultan’s writ does not run—may be regarded as under elective control. 9. The closing of Muscat to the arms traffic disposed of the most serious problem. But the conquest of Hasa in 1913 by Ibn Saud, and the reduction of effective Turkish authority in the peninsula of El Katr, which from 1910-11, consequent on the action taken by His Majesty’s Government to prevent smuggling from the Muscat coast to Persian Makran, had become an important centre for the arms traffic, afforded new openings to the trade which called for the attention of His Majesty’s Government. 10. No undertaking as regards the arms traffic was secured from Ihn Saud either in the Treaty of December 1915 or in the Treaty of Jeddah of May 1927, but the dominions of the Ruler of Nejd do not seem to have given rise to serious difficulty in this connection between 1908 and 1928. The outbreak of the war similarly reduced for the time the seriousness of the problem presented by El Katr ; the Sheikh, under his Treaty of 3rd November 1916 with the Government of India, undertook the same obligations in regard to the suppression of the arms traffic as had already been undertaken in 1902 by the other Trucial Chiefs, and no incident of importance occurred in connection with the trade during the remaining years of the European W ar. (b) 1919-1928. 11. The Naval authorities in the Persian Gulf reported in December 1920 that the present situation of the arms traffic indicated that, failing effective action to suppress the trade, a recrudescence of what took place before the war was probable. The chief centre of the traffic was reported to he Koweit, c. in c., e. indies, El Katr and the Trucial Sheikhdom of Dabai being minor centres ; the chief ' markets were southern Persia and Mesopotamia, with a continuous hut small infiltration of arms into Persian Baluchistan; and the line followed by the traffic was principally across the Gulf to the south Persian coast neai Lingah. 12. His Majesty’s Government took a serious view of the danger of any revival of the trade, and as a result a conference of the interested authoiities was held in Karachi in August 1921. The conclusions reached ly the Aup. 28 1921, conference Were that, while available figures showed no immediate mailed p.4«04. 3 m 453 ^ manivs soiery iu me v/i .. x - which were closely watching the traffic and periodically seaicbmg (1 K)US &gt; that there had not been any material increase in the traffic.

To deal with the matter the Conference recommended the tenance of the existing naval forces in the Gulf; the application of iTes^' to the local Sheikhs ; the grant of authority immediately to establish a boat coastal patrol should an increase of the traffic take place • ti? 1 establishment of a wireless installation at Koweit; and the making of off ^ to persuade the Sheikh of Koweit to establish registration of armc ^ lines accepted in Unseat in 19] 2. mS 0U the Naval C. in C., B.

The death in March 1921 of Sheikh Salim of Koweit had remov ] the principal figure in the arms traffic, and the succession of Sheikh Ahnnd el-Jabir afforded an opportunity to apply pressure to the Principality iiuhe matter (cp. para. 3 of Koweit Memorandum on p. JJ)- In view of this •uul of the finding of the Conference that the trade in arms was relaVivelv insignificant, the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government decided that the problem was not sufficiently serious to' justify soechl expenditure on wireless or special coastal motor boats, and that exist in o- arrangements were probably adequate to meet it.

That decision has been justified by events. The new Sheikh of Koweit has actively co-operated with His Majesty’s Government in the suppression of the arms traffic since his accession in 1921; by 1925 the Politied Resident was able to report (in connection with the deliberations of the Anns Traffic Conference at Geneva) that the trade, whether to Makran or to the httoial between the Shatt-al-Arab and Tingah, was relatively unimportant* in April 1920 it was decided that the maintenance of the telephone*and patrol establishment instituted on the Makran coast in 1907 in connection with the abolition of the arms traffic was no longer necessary ; and while in the same year the efforts of the Persian Government to disarm their subjects on the south Persian coast led to a temporary increase of smugMino- fiorn that coast to 1 racial Oman (in connection with the suppression of which His Majesty’s Government agreed that, provided they reported their captures, the Trucial Chiefs might lie authorised to retain, for the use of their own military forces, such arms and ammunition as were seized by them), the repoits of the local authorities have otherwise shown 3 r ear by year a consistent decrease in the trade, to which the exhaustion of the supplv of arms on the Arab coast has doubtless contributed. UllllllCLJ. J . 16. \\ bile a continual vigilance is necessary, the problem at the present day is one of inconsiderable dimensions, and the engagements existing between His Majesty’s Government and the rulers of the Arab littoral and eisia, coupled with the presence of His Majesty’s ships, are adequate, if stncth interpreted, to keep it within bounds. On the Persian littoral it is, moieovei, c efimtely to the interest of the Persian Government that it should r e , 1( ( u 1 ce( . t0 Ihe lowest possilffe level, but Persia is only slowly establishing l 61 aU . 1011 *? ln Persian Baluchistan; she is for practical purposes impotent ff T ’ f a o• S( T r • aS concerne( l the trade is kept under thanks to the f- ui , 8 ? j 18 Majesty s Government.

In the meantime I thought it wae &lt;iuite useless for him to raise this in our Commission. He agreed to th t, and no reference wac made by him to an^ negotiations between ue. As regi res (e) f he had elroe-y put in in writing the familiar reservations oi the Persian Government about the article of the Convention applying to the Perei n Gulf. I knew that he was bound to repeat these reservations in the Commission, but I tolt him that if he entered into any argument on the lyueetion, or put forward any detailed proposals for revision, I should probably have to return a polemical reply. If, on the other hand, he simply repeated his former reservation in more or lees formal terms, I should not have to refer to the past and coni', content myself with a vague and sympathetic reference to the future His speech, when it CMne, was quite innocuous and I enclose an extract from an advance copy of the Froeks-verbaux how I replied. I trust you will think that that was equally harmless. Although Mendel, Esq., C.M.G.' / y -*? * i ~ Although we oureelvee are satisfied with the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 ®e it stands, it has been quite evident frora the discuss lone in our Commission that it has become obsolete in certain points and th-t there is a pretty general demand for its re-examination* Indeed, it is quite certain that in order to get it ratified it will have to be fitted in to the general framework of e disarmament convention. In these circumstances it is quite clear that *e are not going to be able to retain the article about the Persian Gulf, at toy r te in its present form, as the Persians will never accept any document containing this clause and we have no particular support for it among the other Delegations. In these circumstances, the best course for us to adopt seems to me to avoid advocating too aggressively at Geneva a clause which merely annoys the Persians and gets no support from any other quarter, and to do what we can by negotiation locally to obtain agreement on the lines we desire. I know, of course, none of the loccl aspects of the question, but from the formal point ol view the Convention of 1925 is not in force, and by allowing the clause to lapse we are not therefore giving up anything which we in fact posseae.

My Lords are of opinion that the present British policy has produced the desired result of reducing the traffic in arms to the lowest limits. They consider therefore that no alteration in this policy is justified that is calculated to maKe the task more difficult without corresponding advantages in some other direction 3. In view of recent events in the Henjam controversy the final sentence or j^aragraih 11 oi no longer carries muhh, if &amp; ny» eight. ier-Secretary of State, i'OkEXQN OFFICE, S.V.l- '' K3 adventa^ee that accrue from the conclusion or a bi lateral agreement with Ptraia are, therefore, liKely to oe outweighed by the diri’iculties thf t mi^ht be e erienced In the working of the Agreement. In i-articuler, tne eu^geetion that . ereian enipe should be empowered to aearch britieh vessels on the high bees is, in tne o&lt; inion of j y l ords, iiifedmissible. Such a treaty right is too lively to be abused and would form a very undesirable precedent. 5* Paragraph 8 of tiiC aoove mentioned letter e tatee that the firman of 1897 will at once be terminated as soon as tne Persians discover Its existence. Ihe firman certaij rights to Hie Majesty’s Goveiutent, and it does not seem desirable to take the view that it can be denounced by the ersians in this way, without some quid pro quo being given. In 1980 the opinion w as expressed by H.J . M inister at j.ehran that it was desirable that hie Majesty’s Government mould reserve their lights under tnis arrangement, and &gt;y nords consider this to be the better way of looking at it. With reference -o the W/T suggestxon (ftxtish legation Tehian letter of 1st July,1932, ph 2 -a.graph 10),whilst ^his proposal is certainly practical, given good will on ooth eidee, it is of such a general nature that in practice it can be safely raid that no ship, either British or Persian would hav £••••«.•r^v have the eli&amp;hteet compunction in reporting either 'Signals failed' or 'No answer received', and in dis regarding entirely any W/T regulation should it be desired to search a suspicious vessel witnout delay, 7* My Lords presume that the Foreign Office will propose the necessary instructions to the British representatives at Geneva| A copy of this letter has been sent to Indi?

My dear Gilbert, fy pot I shall be glad if you will look at the recent correspondence, ending with that enclosed in Baxter f s it letter No. E 3693/2529/34 of August \, regarding the suggestion that we should conclude a bilateral Arms Traffic Agreement with Persia. I now enclose a copy of a letter from Colonel Fowle at Bushire, giving his views on the subject, and those of the Senior Naval Officer. You will remember that we have been awaiting this letter from Bushire, which was foreshadowed in paragraph 11 of Hoare's letter of July 1, before further considering the question. 2. As you know, our first reactions to the whole suggestion were distinctly unfavourable. Firstly, we did not see that we stood to gain anything from concluding such nn agreement with Persia. Secondly, we thought such an agreement would inevitably conflict with the provisions of the/ 8 ' ^thwaite, Esq.. WHY IMf By Am MAIL of y/ 2 / 3 L ENCLOSURE IN W.

Thirdly, we feared it would almost certainly lead to a treaty restriction on the liberty of British warships to search Persian vessels for arms, and hence that it might lead to a serious recrudescence of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. 3* We have now reconsidered the position, and we are doubtful whether our first impressions were entirely sound. I do not mean to say that we are in favour of concluding an agreement with the Persians on the subject at all costs; hut it seems at least possible that the Persian wish to conclude such an agreement with us is one which we might possibly be able to turn to our own advantage. 4. Take, for example, the first point in paragraph 2 above, - the question what advantage His Majesty's Government are going to obtain out of concluding such bilateral agreement with Persia. Persian co-operation as such is not likely to be of great assistance to the wavy in putting down the arms traffic in the Gulf. tut if we agree to negotiate some sort of harmless agreement with the/T-7- iTT '• i 1 LfK) the Persians on this point, to which they seem to attach some importance, and if we insisted (as we should insist) that such an agreement would only come into force as part of the general treaty settlement, there would at least be a further inducement to the Persians to conclude the settlement. Recent pz^ivate letters from Eoare show that he attaches considerable importance to this proposed arms ti*affic agreement, as one of his few potential assets in the negotiations. (The only other two new inducements, you may be interested to hear, which in his opinion might also be used to persuade the Persians that it is wedn their while to come to terms, are the “Bahrein dilemma” and the proposal to offer docking facilities in India, see Tehran telegram No. 18 Saving of May 30. We have written to you separately on both these points,/. In another letter, dated July 15, Hoare writes that ”1 am rainer obstinately disposed to believe that if you can do something with the arms traffic the effect -light be considerable”. We do not ourselves imagine wmu *- (i effect/n • ; » • effect would be so great as to turn the scale in favour of the whole Treaty settlement, but clearly if we can show the Persians that they can get more or less what they want, but only as a part of the whole general settlement, it will be all to the good. 5. The second difficulty in the way of concluding a bilateral Arms Traffic Agreement with Persia was the possibility or, as we imagined, the practical certainty, that any agreement likely to be acceptable to the Persians would conflict with the provisions of the International Arms Traffic Convention of Geneva to which we are committed, at any rate it can be definitely established that it will never come into force. Obviously we must avoid being hound hy the terms of two conflicting documents. On further reflection, however, it appears to us that this difficulty might he surmounted by specifi cally providing in the terms of the proposed agreement with Persia that it shall automatically terminate on the coming into force of the Geneva Convention in respect of eitner party./This would not, of course, meet the Persian par vj • Government’s contention that they dislike the provisions of the Geneva Convention and would like to come to a separate agreement with us instead. As, however, the Persians themselves are always maintaining that the Geneva Convention has no prospect at all of ever coming into force, they might find it difficult to oppose some such solution. On the other hand, if they did object, it might be possible to get over the difficulty by including a provision whereby the agreement with Persia on the ♦ subject of arms traffic could be denounced either at any time or at very short notice. 6. We come now to the third difficulty, the possibility that co-operation with Persia on the lines suggested by the Persian Government may merely limit the activities of our own warships and hence lead to a recrudescence of the arms traffic in the Gulf. We here still feel that any treaty provision by which His Majesty’s Government would publicly renounce all intention of ever interfering witA '• lie arms traffic/traffic in vessels flying the Persian flag on the high seas would he dangerous and undesirable. Such a treaty provision would soon become known in the Gulf and quite a lively traffic in arms might develop in vessels flying the Persian flag. ihe iiavy would then certainly be unable to prevent arms from finding their way into Persia by sea; and although the Resident and Senior Naval Officer are probably right in thinking that the Persian tribesmen will be much more inclined to retain these arms themselves rather titan to pass them on to the Indian frontier tribes, we think that there would be a distinct danger of their passing arms on across the frontier if they were actively harried by Persian troops. Although Persian troops seldom succeed in collecting arms from frontier tribes, they can often make things so hot for the tribes, that the latter are only too glad if they can sell the arms across the frontier for a good price. In fact, the very zeal displayed by the Persian regular troops in disarming the tribes may increase the danger of the aims finding their way/way from Persia across the frontier into India or Afghanistan, 7, ihere is another point to be considered, We must not assume that the danger of arms being smuggled into India could only come through Persia. There are several hundred miles of Indian Mekran coast, and very few sloops, so that if dhows flying the Persian flag were immune from search outside the three-mile limit, it might become difficult adequately to protect our own coast. 8. We must therefore make certain that any agreement reached with the Persians shall not deprive us of any right to search Persian vessels for arms on the high seas. This, however, is not really the strictly correct way of putting it, for the only right we have, so far as I know, to search Persian vessels for arms on the high seas depends on the Firman of 1897, which will at once be terminated as soon as the Persians discover its existence. On its disappearance we shall presumably be unable to claim the right to search Persian vessels for arms on the High Seas. The ability of the Navy to keep down the Arms Traffic in the Gulf seems, indeed,/IfK indeed, to depend in the last resort, on the fact that potential arms traffickers do not know the real weakness of our present treaty position. 9. Hoare's suggestion in paragraph 10 of his letter of July 1, if acceptable to the Persians, would, however give British warships the right to search Persian vessels on the high seas in certain circumstances, and this would be, from the point of view of the suppression of the arms traffic, a definite step forward. He proposes that we should only search Persian vessels 'where definite information or very strong suspicion 'exists'. I presume that at the present moment we should seldom if ever search a Persian vessel on the high seas unless definite information or very strong suspicion does exist. Hoare proceeds: 'and then only where an answer 'to a wireless signal indicates that no Persian vessel 'is available'. I am not sure that we have quite grasped his meaning here, but we think that it would be undesirable to provide that we should not search a Persian/Persian vessel beiore receiving the special concurrence by wireless of, say, the Persian Governor of the Gulf ports. It may therefore he better to provide that the search would tahe place unless gin answer to a wireless signal indicated that a Persian warship was available. This, however, is merely detail, though important detail. The main point is that, if the Persians were willing to accept some such arrangement as that now suggested by Hoare, we might be in a stronger treaty position for continuing to suppress the arms traffic in the Gulf than we are at present. 10. The real snag, however, is the necessity of providing in any such agreement that Persian warships shall have similar rights to search British and Arab vessels for arms. There is undoubtedly reason to fear that if such a treaty right were conferred upon the new Persian Navy, it might sooner or later be abused. The Persians might easily, for example, start searching Arab vessels outside Persian territorial waters, nominally for arms,/arms, 'but actually for contraband. They might even start harassing Arab dhows for purely political reasons. This difficulty is certainly a serious one and may perhaps be so serious as to render it undesirable for us to try to pursue the question further. I rather think, however, that it may conceivably be possible to overcome this difficulty too. For example, we might lay down very precisely in any agreement with Persia the exact procedure to be followed in the case of the search of a suspected dhow; we might lay down that the search should be carried out with all speed and that the dhow should on no account be detained or deflected from her course unless it was proved as a result of the search that she was in fact engaged in the arms traffic. We might further provide that, if found to be engaged in the arms traffic, she should be taken, in the case of a Persian dhow, to the nearest Persian port, and in the case of an Arab dhow, to the nearest Arab port; and we could introduce any other safeguards which you, the Government/Government of India, the Resident and the Senior Naval Officer could devise. 11. I shall he glad to hear as soon as possible what you think of the whole proposal. It seems to me that, in view of the position in the general treaty negotiations, we should do all we can to turn this Persian suggestion to account. There is also the point that the more it can be arranged for the British Navy and the new Persian ships to cooperate in the Gulf, the stronger will be the argument that the Persians ought to give us an extension of the present facilities at Henjam. 12. I am sending a copy of this letter to Cunningham at the Admiralty. Yours ever' ;opy* 7 (3 4058/2529/34). O THE RESIDENCY, BUSHIRE, the 2nd August, 1932* Bear Rendel, Please refer to paragraph 11 of Mr. Hoare’s demi- official letter No#592/5, of the 1st July last, on the subject Of the latest Persian attitude towards the Arms Traffic Convention. 2. In reply to Sir Hugh Biscoe’s request for his comments, Captain Crabbe has furnished the following extract from some notes recently prepared by him, which he considers accurately sums up the position to-day in regard to the Arms Traffic in the Gulf. 'There have been some vague reports which might tend to show that there is a danger of the resumption of Arms Traffic if Naval vigilance was relaxed. There has not been any clear case of traffic in arms for supply to malcontents on the frontiers of India. The Persian Government have a definite interest in suppressing the trade; they have succeeded in practically disarming a large proportion of the tribes in the country and are busily employed combing out the arms remaining in the hands of the more outlying tribes. Thus if any arms do find their way into Persia, the tribunal chief tains would be more inclined to retain them than to pass them on to the Indian frontier tribes. Careful watch is however being kept on all ports in the Gulf of Oman and ships will continue to cruise in the area off the Baluchistan l,R endel, Esq., Foreign Office, London.MSo ^ Baluchistan Coast, so as to show the natives that though the Anas Traffic may he non-existent for the moment, yet vigilance is not relaxed.” I agree generally with Captain Crahhe. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Hoare. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) T.C.Powle.1 (j 3693/25 29/34, BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. July 1st, 1932, My dear Rendel, Y ou won't be surprised if I aay that your letter of June 11th about the latest Persian attitude towards the Arms Traffic Convention is no great help. 2. If I am right, the Persians ’’are looking for a friendly gesture from us with a view to responding to it”: uiie gesture you suggest is a very definite, though perfectly polite and perfectly correct, snub. o. I wonder if this is the only course open to us. Your principal objection to attempting to reach a bi-lateral agreement with Persia is that we should be speaking with two different voices, here and at Geneva. This would be an insup erable objection, I agree, if the Convention were in force or if there were good prospects of its coming into force at an early date. If I am to believe Feroughi these prospects are virtually nil. I therefore suggest that there would be no vice in reaching a bi-lateral agreement provided that there were nothing in the agreement contrary to the spirit of the Convention (i.e., the prevention of illicit traffic in arms); obviously the agreement could not possiblj contain anything of the sort. 4. Standing instructions to the Senior Naval Officer (see your despatch No. 499 of September 2nd, 1931) are ’’Persian vessels should not be searched for arms in Persian territorial waters, and on the high seas only where definite information or very strong suspicion exists”. V^e cannot find any case of a Persian vessel being searched for many years back. 5 ./ p Rendel Esqui re, lhe foreign Office.T me 5. Persia is now to have her fleet’ and my strong impression is that the more we try to treat her naval aspirations seriously the less likely is that fleet to be a nuisance. 6. Pardon a reminiscent digression to illustrate and make my point that in dealing with folks such as these, one should never weary of play acting. Three summers ago the Egyptian Cfovernment were invited by the United States of .America to adhere to the Kellog Pact. They were hot and bothered about it because if they adhered without any mention of our reservations they would be branded as traitors, whereas if they did not choose their words carefully they might get into trouble with Eis Majesty’s Government. And so, with the active assistance of the Foreign Office,! cooperated with the Egyptian Government in con cocting the Egyptian counter blast of a suitably innocuous strength - Pure foolery, but it probably saved quite a lot of trouble. 7. Can’t we play the fool in the present case? Before trying to sketch a course of action, I should perhaps dissipate the fear indicated at the end of paragraph 4 of your letter and again in paragraph 5 that the Persians not being keen on the suppression of the arms traffic any agreement (which would of necessity transfer some responsibility to the Persians) would tend to lead to an increase in the traffic. It may safely be said that there are no arms in Persia today available for illicit expert: disarmament has been pretty thorough and such tribesmen as may have managed to retain arms would certainly not part with them. With regard to transit across Persia into India or Afghanistan, I feel sure that the Persian Government would be just as keen to stop it as we should, not necessarily in pure neighbourliness but out of fear lest some part of the Eonsigmnent be ’’lost” on its way through Persia.I 8. It may therefore safely be said that there is so little arms traffic that from that point of view Persian co operation presents no danger* The danger to be guarded against is Persia wishing to search Arab vessels on the high seas. 9. Could we work into the Treaty or elsewhere something to this effect:- In view of Persia’s inability to adhere to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 and of her desire to cooperate within the limits of her resources in supnressing the arms traffic, it is agreed that the two parties will immediately communicate to each other any information which may reach them in so far as it affects the Persian Gulf and the territories adjoining it. In territorial waters sole responsibility (more or less on lines of slavery protocol). 10. On the high seas British vessels will only search Persian vessels where definite information or very strong suspicion exist and then only where an answer to a wireless signal indicates that no Persian vessel is available and vice versa in respect of the search of British vessels or vessels of states mentioned in Article 1 of the Treaty. 11. If by any conceivable chance anything can be made of these ideas, I think it’s worth playing down to the Persians. I should not think so, were I not pretty sure that the Arms traffic in the Gulf is negligible and that Persia is quite clear that she has a lively interest in keeping it so. I will ask Biscoe to get some views from the Senior Naval Officer and to send them to you direct. 12. With regard to your last paragraph, I've already told you that I'm very ignorant in League matters, but the instruction I've referred to above states definitely that i^he Convention is notnot in force. Gan we have obligations under it until it is in force. Again supposing Peroughi is wrong and it does come into force would it be the sort of thing the League hates if Persia threatened to withdraw from the League unless the provisions regarding the search of native vessels were rendered inapplicable to Persian vessels? 13. Of course, it is realized that the Firman of 1897 is bound to go, if a treaty is concluded? 14. Ag regards Persian objections to the 1925 Conventiors would it make much practical difference if the provisions were altered to say that all vessels under five hundred tons could be searched in the special maritime zones? This would avoid the distinction against ’’native 1 ' or ’’riparian” craft which the Persians so dislike. It would give the Persians no right uhey wouldn 1 1 enjoy tomorrow if the Convention were in force and they adhered to it. 15.

I now enclose copies of letters from the Admiralty and from the India Office. In their last sentence the Admiralty allude briefly to one aspect of the question which has not, perhaps, been sufficiently emphasized in the past correspohdence. While it is trae that in general it is the policy of His Majesty’s Government to press for further accessions to the Convention, -here are certain special reasons why Persia’s intransigent attitude towards this question is not wholly unwelcome to us. ?he Persians, (who made up their minds about the Convention longlong before -here *gs any eertous talk of a Persian Havy), do not seem to have realised that If this international instrument sere brought into force with their cooperation it would provide then with an admira^^Scuse for harassing Arab dhows and pursuing an active anti-smuggling camneign on the high seas of the Gulf under cover of the search for arms. Owing to their peculiar fiscal system smuggling is I gather pretty general in the Gulf at present* and they presumably have little chance of putting it do*n effec ive* ly as long as their activities are legally confined to a stria of water over nine hundred miles long and only -hree (or, if you allow their own pretension in the matter of territorial waters, six) - miles broad* But he f y c uld do quite a lot of preventive work If in practice ' had the whole of the Gulf to operate in, and we feel that the result might hardly help British prestige among the Arabs a result which would in itself be by no ra &gt; ns unwelcome to the Persians*■1 ^ ^ n ' r ' r feel thfit we have now done ell that we can reaeonably be expected to do to secure be Persian Goremment'e accession to the Arms Traffic Convention, *nd that when you have returned to Feroughl a reoly on the lines suggested in my letter of the 11th June It would be well that you should make no further attempt to convert them.Previous Papers .*— hU liegistt'i- No. P'Z. u '0 SECRET .7 POLITICAL DEPARTMENT ? — from Telegram 7-o .

The proposal is briefly that H.M.G. and the Persian Government should first reach a Joint agreement regarding the arms traffic in the Gulf, and that, when this had been achieved, the British and Persian delegates at the League of Eations should jointly endeavour to secure the revision of the Arms Traffic Convention so as to meet the objections to that Convention in its present form, as the result of which the Persian Government have hitherto been unwilling to sign it. 2. I do not think that it is necessary to examine this proposal in great detail in view of the conclusive objections to following it up indicated in the Foreign ft/ Office reply to Mr.Hoare of 11th June, flagged/below. But our experience of the Persians during the whole course of these negotiations lends little support to the suggestion in the Minister’s letter of May 9th that the object of their latest move may be the search for a friendly gesture on our part with a view to responding to it. The Foreign Office interpretation of their intentions is very much more probable. 3.

It has to be remembered that the G. oi I* were •jnable to ratify the Arms Traffic Convention on account of objections, like those of Persia, to the definition of 'native vessels' 1 (which would include small In .ian craft), and the provisions for visit of such vessels. This, however, does not affect the objection to the present Persian proposal, nor the arguments used in t F.O. letter to Kr. Hoare of 11th June. It is desirable that a general international agreement (not necessarily on the precise lines of the aooruive Arms Traffic Convention, to vrhich the G. of I. objected) should precede any local bilateral agreement with Persia.

Minister at Tehran concerning a proposal by the Persian Government that this country should come to an agreement with them on the arms traffic in the Gulf and the Arms Traffic Convention, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you fox the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that They concur generally with the vie** expressed in Mr. Rendel’s letter to Mr* noare of tiu. 11th June. Any agreement which prevented tais country from taking action except in Arab territorial waters and which rendered it necessary to rely on i ^rsian control of her territorial waters, would ^robaoly 'useless in preventing illicit arms traffic. The amount of supervision authorised by the Arms Traffic Convention is in any case very limited It does Jhder Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.

These limited powers might well be accepted by Persia without any lowering of her national ^ amour-propre, especially as after the arrival of her new warships in the Gulf she would, when the Convention comes into force, be in a position to exercise similar powers herself.

Mr. Hoar? to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 7 ) (No. 255.) '' S ' ’ WITH reference to my telegram of to-day, No. 82^1 'have the^honour'to inform you that I had a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and il l Minister of Court yesterday at the latter’s house at 10 o clocl ffis Highness in anticipation of an all-day sitting, invited us both to lunch with him 2 1 have had some slight difficulty in recording the conversation, and, though I am satisfied that the enclosed memorandum represents fairly faithfully the gist of our conversation, its chronological order is probably not completely accurate. ^ 3 As you are aware from recent telegrams, 1 was afraid that the decision reached by His Majesty s Government to transfer Imperial Airways route to the Arab coast would be ill-received. As a matter of fact, the only indication that Teymourtache gave of disappointment was an enquiry whether, supposing he asked us to reconsider the decision on the understanding that we dropped our request for facilities at Hen jam, we would agree to do so. When I told him that we would certainly not he made no further reference to the matter. 4. It will be observed that, with regard to the discussion on the subject of Henjam, 1 made a very definite reference to the probable views of the First Lord of the Admiralty. I did so in order to make my statement as emphatic as possible, and, so far as I can judge, I produced the’desired effect. 5. It will be further observed that I mentioned the steamships Khuzistan and “ Baroda,” in connexion with which I am at present engaged in discussing with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs two recent instances of the aggressiveness of the local officials, to which it has been necessary to take exception. 6. With regard to the x\rms Traffic Convention mentioned towards the end of my memorandum, I enclose, for convenience of reference, copies of FeroughPs letter, which I have already sent to the Department. I imagine that all Teymourtache has in mind (I believe him to be really the author of the letter) is the fact, or at any rate the appearance, of co-operating in the Gulf with His Majesty’s Government on a footing of absolute equality. I admit that this hankering after appearances is a little wearisome, but the abolition of the fez in Turkey is an instance of a similar mentality, and I submit that where Mustafa Kemal has led we cannot complain if Teymourtache seeks to follow. 7. Throughout the discussion Feroughi spoke only once or twice, but he appeared to be enjoying himself, and displayed none of the uneasiness which I noticed in my first conversation with him and Teymourtache. This I regard as a favourable symptom, because, so far as I am aware, Feroughi, if he had the energy and will-power to espouse any cause, would always have been the champion °f good relations with His Majesty’s Government. 8. Teymourtache was friendly to the point of effusiveness throughout, am fully aware that at one time he was equally, or perhaps more, friendly towards my predecessor, and professed to him just as earnestly as he has to me ais desire to reach a settlement. Even with this precautionary admission, I eheve his protestations to be sincere, though I admit that 1 do not quite understand why he is so insistent in his endeavours to extract the last possible ou nce out of His Majesty’s Government; indeed, quite possibly prepared to miss u settlement in an endeavour to extract the last impossible ounce. It may simply e an extreme instance of the passion for a bargain which is deeply seated in the astern mind, or it may be that he considers his position to be weakened by the 1 scorn forts which his economic policy has caused, and feels that an inconclusive suspension of negotiations as the result of even an excessive assertion of Persia s [497 g—1] b2 claims would be less damaging than a settlement which his critics could represent as weakness before Bntish^pressvme.t d tches f r0 m various European capitals ^ • L Minister or Foreign Secretary concerned was experiencing rffichv in'adopting the policy which he admitted to be the right one, at any Jafe until he knew how the electoral cat would .pimp; and so I do not judge Teymourtache harshly. g despatch, with its enclosures, to the Foreign \°-,. v iHhe Government of India (No. 106), the Honourable the Political Sent i^ the Persian Gulf (No 90 ) and to Hi s Majesty s High Commissioner at Bagdad for the information of Sir E.

I had, however been over-ruled, largely, I thought, as the result of his visits to London He could therefore, safely conclude that His Majesty's Government were keenly anxh™ to reach an agreement, leymourtache replied that he did not see that anything could possibly have been gained by a postponement of the negotiations and asked how I thought that a spirit of confidence could be created while major issues were outstanding. I said that I thought there were a number of ways instancing the joint survey of the Baluchistan frontier, which we could perfectly well have refused, and from which I rather fancied we had nothing to gain and possibly a httle to lose and a possible arrangement for dealing with frontier district rebels in that region. Teymourtache agreed profusely that matters were easier now, but did not agree that negotiations should have been deferred. i ^ 1110111 to wonder whether a frontier rectification in Baluchistan might not provide the necessary “compensation” for Bahrein though he hastened to sa\ that the East was not the favourite part of the Empire I told him that I did not know in the least, but anyway it would be quite useless to make any suggestion if the Persian attitude on the subject of Heniam was a completely non possumus one, as his language seemed to indicate. As regards Henjam, I, having lived a good deal in the East, could understand his objections to a lease, though I doubted whether other people, e.g., the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was a person of some importance in the councils of His Majesty's Government, would be able to; but I could not understand, and quite certainly people m England would not understand, why the Persian Government should object to affording, in the full exercise of Persia's sovereign rights, the facilities for wmch we asked in consecration of a treaty of friendship. A refusal of these facilities would quite inevitably be regarded in England as a signal proof of unfriendliness and the feeling engendered would render it quite certain that no turther compensation for Bahrein would be entertained for one moment. In Lict [ should regard it as a waste of time to try and think of something, leymourtache replied that though he did not admit that the potential charge of unfriendliness was justified he quite understood that it would almost inevitably be made, and he said positively that if Persian national sentiment could be satisfactorily appeased over Bahrein a settlement regarding Henjam could be reached. (I hroughout the discussion of Bahrein I was insistent that he wanted vindow-dressing and nothing else and he did not deny it.) With regard to Henjam specifically, at one time he talked of the practical uimculties of meeting our wishes, rather suggesting that they lay in the high handed attitude adopted by the naval store-keeper there. I gave him recent instances, i.e., the “ Khuzistan ” and “ Baroda,” to convince him that this was ver y f ar from being the case and so he reverted to the line that Henjam would present no serious difficulties, but for the irregular situation in the Gulf which was a relic of the past and which made Persian opinion particularly sensitive and, indeed, suspicious. Persia had suffered severely, more especially during the war. When I said that we had not taken the initiative in violating Persia’s neutrality he admitted it readily enough, and also admitted that we had at no ime been guilty of aggressive action against Persia, but said that the effect on eisian opinion of the abandonment of Persia's interests by the conclusion of the A nglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 had been just as disastrous as any act of aggression and created the mistrust which had lasted ever since. I told him that finite understood all this, but that we were engaged in removing anomalies, and ! 'y.® were successful in removing' them his objections to Henjam seemed to me t0 disappear. 6 I Throughout the conversation whenever I pressed the discussion of Henjam tf ?t S ^ nc ^ lne d to switch off to Bahrein as soon as he could, and he kept saying a be wondered how a settlement over Bahrein could be reached. T reminded lm em phatically that he had said in London that he foresaw a quick and easy [497 g— l] b 2agreement. This to my mind could onl} mean, in vie'w of the course of the previous negotiation and of his knowledge that Hen]am was the one material thin 0 * we cared about, that he contemplated some ad\ance to meet us. By bis own admission the withdrawal of Airwavs to the Ai ab coast made matters much easier for him, but, none the less, there was no advance. When I asked what we should do next if we failed to reach a settlement bv ^ negotiation, Tevmourtache looked gloomy and evinced a definite dislike to an appeal to any outside body, saying that if they lost their case opinion in Persia would take the view that the arbitral body had not regarded the issue as between the Sheikh of Bahrein and Persia, but as one between the British Empire and an Asiatic State; it would all make for unpleasantness; but from another aspect an arbitral decision would, of course, relieve the Persian Government of a considerable measure of responsibility. At this stage Hen jam once again came into the discussion, Teymourtache observing that it was a matter which lay within the undisputed control of the Persian Government. I quite agreed and said that of course the Minister for Foreign Affairs could address us a note to-morrow asking us to withdraw. I supposed that we should then burn down the club-house and canteen, remove the coal-depot and blow up the store-houses and—Teymourtache added—fill up the well. I suggested that it might be easier and better to poison it and he quite agreed. Returning to a serious tone I said that none of this would advance our object, which was to place our relations on a good workable basis. He again expressed ready agreement and delivered a little speech on the paramount value to Persia of British friendship. I said that if he would view the draft treaty as a whole, coupled with the withdrawal of our request for air facilities, I thought he would find that he could face public opinion with equanimity. Teymourtache replied that he did not agree, and said that, though in a sense public opinion in Persia was not a factor of great importance, it had to be reckoned with, adding, in evidence, that on his return from Europe he had received from persons who presumably imagined that he had not been in touch with the course of events quite a number of letters severely criticising the settlement with Turkey. I said I quite appreciated this, and realised that even in countries, not excluding Russia, where dictatorships (to use a convenient word) existed, public opinion could not, for some obscure reason, be completely disregarded. At one point I mentioned the Duzdap Railway, saying that this would constitute a very definite benefit to be derived by Persia from the treaty. Teymourtache replied that, so far as he 'was concerned (though this did not matter, because it was not the view of the Persian Government), the Duzdap Railway was of no value to Persia whatsoever. He had been persistent with me on the subject (see my telegram No. 10 of the 9th February, 1932), because the Shah, “who liked railways indiscriminately,' had manifested a keen interest. If a treaty went through, the railway would be used bv Persia, but he was quite clear that it was by no means of importance. It was either at this point or when talking about the remission of a million of the debt that I said that, if he was not careful, I should say to him vdiat Sir Austen Chamberlain once had occasion to sa } German Government. He asked what it was, and I replied that it was to the effect that once they had obtained a valuable concession they immediately belittled it as an excuse for asking for more. Towards the end of the discussion, Teymourtache. who v r as beginning to look tired, began scribbling on a piece of paper w*hat. when he had finished, he called all soi ts of nonsense. This nonsense, which he proceeded to read out to us. Bah. 1 2 3 * * * ' nUm ^ er ^ aZ ' T ^ eas on subject of possible “compensation tor (1) A frontier rectification in Baluchistan.

I cannot remember what I said about the Arms Traffic Convention but evidently (see paragraph 2 of Feroughi’s letter) I said something. You will see that the letter is on very much the same lines as the memorandum comminicated to the League and to that extent calls for no comment. It seems to me however that there is rather more in it than that. My impression is that the Persians want us to make an advance to them of some kind or other with regard to Arms Traffic; verfc possibly the motive is simply national amour propre but I am not sure that they are not looking for a friendly gesture with a view to responding to it.

BOARD OF TRADE, GREAT GEORGS STREET, 17th August, 1931. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 19th May (81233/1931) and its enclosures, regarding the application to native vessels in the Somaliland Protectorate of Article 3 (b) of Section II, of the Second Annex to the Arms Traffic Convention I am directed by the Board of Trade to state that the conditions to which the Governor of Somaliland objects are precisely the same as those laid down in Article XXXII (2) of the Brussels Act of 1890, which relates primarily to the Slave trade. This Article of the Brussels Act applies throughout the zone defined in Article XXI of the Act, and would presundfly include the Somaliland Protectorate. If so, the conditions attaching to the right to fly the flag laid down in the Arms Traffic Convention have applied in Somaliland for some forty years. If they have given rise to so little difficulty in this case, it is not clear why difficulty should arise under the Arms Traffic Convention. The Board are unaware of the reasons which led to the inclusion of the guarantee conditions in the 1890 Act and to their retention in the Arms Traffic Conventions of 1919 and 1925. The^ would only observe that these conditicns are already in force in Kenya under Section 6 of the Native Vessel. Ordinance.

At the third meeting of the Sixty-Third Session of the Council of the League of Nations, during the discussion on the work of the Special Commission en trusted with the preparation of a Draft Convention for the Supervision of the Private Manufacture and Publicity of Manufacture of Arms and Ammunition and of Implements of Mar, the representative of Great Britain, Mr. Henderson referring to a cognate subject, that of the Convention for the Sunervision of the international Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of Mar, of June 17th, 192C, expressed the hope that those States which had not yet announced their intentions in this matter would. consider v/hether they could not, by their ratification, contribute to the bringing into force of the Convention.

It is scarcely necessary to dwell on this point which is so obvious as to have been unanimously recognised during the preparatory work and discussions. It is sufficient here to recall the fact that the two problems (manufacture and traffic) had been considered to be closely bound up with one another. Thus, in his letter of Kay 1st, 192?, to the Secretary of State of the United States, the President of the Council of the League wrote: ' the work carried out by the Permanent Advisory Commission on Military, Naval and Air Questions and by the Temporary Mixed Commission for the Reduction of Armaments, had led these bodies to the conclusion that the two problems of the private manufacture oi arms and the international control of the arms traffic were too closely connected to be dealt with separately, ana that the solution of both had to be sought at the same time and by the same methods. The Persian Government attaches the greatest importance to the two questions being dea±t with together, in accordance with this commonsense view, which has never been contested. It desires to point out that, at Scxty- ;ond Session of the Council in January 1’ T ' Persian delegate, His Excellency Hussein Eh an a , drew attention to the discrepancy, in regar o of the Convention 1925 and the draft Convention ou thu of armaments, and conse quently asked that the provisions ol^ tne ^Convention e to be drawn up on the manufacture of arno, ^ of the Convention of June 17 th, l--o snonl brought into harmony with one anotn-r. Se publicity, between the provisions of June 17th, limitation and reduction ar v&lt;- 5 - II. The second main objection raised by fche Persian Government is that the Convention of June 17th, 1925, constitutes a departure from an express provision of the Covenant of the League of Nations. In Article Z6 d) , the States Members TT v;ill entrust the League with the general supervision of the trade in arms and ammunition with the countries in which the con trol of this traffic is necessary for the common interest’ 1 . In virtue of this provision of the Covenant, the power to supervise the traffic in arms was conferred on the League. In spite of this provision, the Convention of June 17th, 19S5, or - to be exact - .Annex II thereof, provides for supervision tc be exercised in the n special zones'’ by the warships of the High Contracting Parties. We need not dwell on the practical consequences of the substitution of the military police of particular States for a police system enforced by the League of Nations or on its behalf and under its respcnsicility, with all desirable guarantees as to strict impartiality. The Persian Government considers that the oovenanu should be respected and that consequently the general supervision of the trade in arms and ammunition Ox war in the special zones should be carried out cy the league of Nations, all of whose Members have a right to demand that their equality and independence be respected. It is willing to co-operate in the study of the best means of enforcing such supervision, she ex^rcxso of which must not be allowed to infringe the sovereign of any State. y in. The Persian Government desires to pu» third objeotion, no less important t; lan 1 ~ Kith retard to the ^special zones . ^^ .p* .^trarily and, as iar as These zones v.'ere n^ar^-r c g oerned&gt; this the Persian Gnlf ana. »he j go.

Furthermore, the Convention of June 17th, 1925, confines its effective sanctions to ’’native vessels”, the character of which it arbitrarily fixes and which must be of less than 500 tons. Ivo supervision is provided for vessels other than 'native” vessels or for vessels of more than 500 tons. These provisions are such as almost to make one think that the supervision of arms is not really the ob ject which they are designed to achieve. Otherwise, why restrict them so drastically that they cannot affect any cut the national ships of the State specially aimed at? It must not be forgotten that small vessels could only engage in this traffic in a subsidiary capacity. If there is need for supervision, it should be extended to large vessels which are the only ones capable of trans porting arms and ammunition from the places of manufacture situated outside the special zones. The extremely arbitrary notion of ’’native vessels' and of 'less than 500 tons” should disappear from the Con vention. V.

The Convention of June 17th, 1925 should be made more precise on various points, without which it is to be ieared that difficulties of interpretation may arise. This applies, for instance, to the terms 'recoanisei State' and 'time of war', etc. But the Persian Government does not wish to dwell on these questions, which, though important, are of only secondary importance. It may revert do them subsequently when the Convention is revised. VII. In concluding this summary of its views regarding the Convention of June 17th, 1925, the Persian Government desires to renew f he statement which it made as far bach as 1925, affirming it sincere desire to support any reasonable measure or any equitable agreement calculated to contribute in the common interest towards the pre vention of secret (illicit) traffic in arms and ammunition of war. It desires to mention that it has already incorporated in its domestic legislation severe provisions against such traffic in its own territory. In its present form, however, the Convention of June 17th, 1925, is such that Persia is unable to accede to it, inasmuch as it departs from the Covenant of the League of Notions and infringes the fundamental principle of the equality of States in internot ional 1 v.

My Lord, With reference to Your Lordship 1 s Circular despatch of August 13th on the subject of the traffic in arms, I have the honour to say that I am uncertain of the exact intention of article 3 (b) of Section II of the Second Annex to the Convention for the supervision of the trade in arms. If surictl^ ^ppli-d to this Protectorate it will mean that xew if any natives will be allowed to possess boats, under the present regulations all vessels plying in Protectorate waters must be registered and fly the flag.

I have to call your attention to Article 22 of the Convention which stipulates that no authorisation to fly the flag of the Signatory Power shall be granted to native vessels of less than 500 tons as defined in Article 20 except by specified authorities and subject to conditions as prescribed in Section II, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Annex II to the Convention. It has been observed that in order to give full effect to the Convention in this respect some amendment of Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 may be necessary as regards vessels belonging to British subjects in the territories within the special zones, but it is thought desirable that the matter should be dealt with by local legislation as regards vessels belonging to British protected persons of any of those territories. The Board of Trade observe that this Article is identical with Article 14 of the unratified Arms Traffic-Convention signed at St. Germain en Laye in 1919, which, in its turn, is practically identical with .Articles 32 and 34 of the Act of Brussels of 1890.

My Lords think consideration might be given to the proposal of the Government of India that an attempt be made to obtain a revision of Chapter III of the Convention with a view to removing the discriminatory nature of its provisions concerning native vessels. Apart from the objections of the Government of India, these provisions would appear likely to prevent Persia from ratifying the Convention and may possibly also give rise to difficulties with Iraq, and Nejd. g. xt will no doubt be difficult to get agreement ior the amendment of the Convention so as to make it applicable to all vessels of 500 tons or under. Such general applicati v/ould probably be opposed by France, Ii/aly and U.S.A., if not by other countries, as .in the past. On the other nand the growing nationalism of the States bordering the area defined in paragraph 2 of Article 20 of the Convention is likely to render it increasingly difficult to get them to acquiesce in the terms of the Convention. It would therefore appear that the only way to make the Convention effective Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l. wouldwould be to amend the maritime supervision m bupeivision clauses so that they would apply to , 1 ^-pectea vessels of 500 tons or under'» As the Convent i on oi a ion already provides for the payment of compensation in a case of wrongful arrest My Lords would have thought it difficult for countries to justify their opposition to such amendment but all countries are reluctant to authorise any interference with their merchant shipping on the high seas in peace time. 4. In view, however, of the hesitation already shown by the signatories in ratifying this Convention, there will still be a strong probability that a considerable number of vessels will be exempt from supervision. 5.

Arms Traffic Convention. Question of ratification. Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the letter from Secretary, Economic 8c Overseas Department, No.4315/30, dated 12th June 1930, and to say, with reference to paragraph 2 of his letter No.2406/30, dated 6th May 1930, that, if the discriminatory nature of the provisions of Chapter III of the Convention could 'be removed, there would he no objection in principle to its ratification on behalf of India; and the Government of India agree that an attempt should be made to obtain a revision of the Chapter. 2. In your letter No.E.&amp; 0.2406/30, dated the 6th May 1930, it has been held that the three practical difficulties mentioned in the Government of India telegram NO.1460-S, dated 18th August 1926 are of a minor character and not insuperable. The second of these difficulties (which relates to Article 22) was considered the most important. Accoruing to Article 22, all native and so all Indian vessels of less than 500 tons net are required to obtain a yearly authorisation✓ authorisation to fly the national flag and the Government of India expressed the view that this was in conflict with Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. The Board of Trade, however, hold that Article 22 does not place on His Majesty's Government any further obligations than those assumed 40 years ago in connection with the Act of Bruscelc of lu90 and that therefore there is no pressing need fox' cin 8Jneii(lnien'fc oj. tiie MepciisLnd Shipping Ac'fc. 3. The Government of India however feel some doubt as regards the correctness of the view expressed by the Board of Trade. 4. The Regime prescribed by Articles 32 to 34 of the Act of Brussels applies to native ships as defined in Article 31 while travelling in the zone defined in Article 21. Article 31 defines a 'native ship' as one which fulfils one of the two following conditions:- Ca) a vessel which presents the appearance of native build or rig; Cb) a vessel the Captain of which and the majority of the crew of which are natives of countries bordering on the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Article 21 defines the 'zone' as the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and that portion of the Indian Ocean lying west of a line drawn from Cape d’Ambre in Madagascar to the coast of Baluchistan and passing 20 miles to the east ox Cape Ras-ul-Hadd in Arabia. The Masters of British steamers based on Aden are not Indians and hence, with the exception of a few country craft trading from the Continent oi Inxia to the East Coast of Africa, the only Indian craft affected by the Act of Brussels are the coasting craft based upon Aden. 5.5. The position under the Convention is, however, different• ihe epdcinl zone in the Convention is smsiiler than that in the Act of Brussels; 'but this is of no practical imiJortance, as Aden is included within 'both zones. The important difference lies in the definition of a ’’native ship”. According to Article £0 of the Convention, Article 2£ applies to all vessels of less than 500 tons net - Ca) which are owned, fitted or commanded by natives of India, or (b) of which half the crew are Indians. 6. There are 9 steamers based upon Aden and engaged in trading between Aden and ports in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Seven of these steamers are under 500 tons net and hence these seven steamers, although they are not affected by the Act of Brussels, will be governed by the Convention. This means that these steamers will have to obtain a yearly authorisation to fly the national flag and will not be able to obtain that authorisation unless the owners and Captain comply with paragraph 3 of Section 2 of the Annexure to the Convention. 7. The Government of India are of opinion that the application of the Convention to these 7 steamers would create a difficulty which does not exist under the Act of Brussels. It would be impossible to ignore the presence of these seven steamers when ratifying the Convention; the regime lain down by Article 22 could not be applied to these 7 steamers without an amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, ano. any differentiation between these steamers an^- other British steamers would be strongly resented by the owners. 8. I am further to add that the Government of India presume thatt-iiat the intent-ion and eiiect oi' Art-icle 22 is the same as if the words 'within the special zone' had been included th^i ain, and that the application of Article 22 is limited to the special zone defined in Article 12. This point is of some importance, for the reason that, if Article 22 applies to native vessels of less than 500 tons, whereever they may he, it will apply to all British vessels of that tonnage based on India.

Gommeroial Relations and Treaties Department, Board of Tfade, Great George Street, London, S.Vf.l. 30th June, 1930. Sir I am directed hy the Board of Trade to state that they have had under their consideration your letter of the 14th May (W.4544/72/95), and its enclosures, regarding certain objections raised by the Government of India to the special ^ones provisions of the Arms Traffic Convention. The purely legal difficulty as regards the conflict between the provisions of the Convention and certain sections of the Merchant Shipping Acts has been fully dealt with in the Board’s letter to the Colonial Office of the 8th February CM.4446/30), of which a copy it is understood has been forwarded to your Department. The Board have not previously considered the objection now raised by the Government of India as to the use of the term ’’native vessels”, but any proposal to extend the provisions of the Convention relating to the special cones so as to apply to all vessels of 500 tons net or under, and not to native vessels only of that tonnage might give rise to difficulty. As it is conceivable that vessels of 500 tons net or under registered in the United Kingdom might engage in trade in the special zones, the Board would presumably require power to license all vessels of the tonnage in question to fly the flag in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and this would entail legislation. Alternatively, if the Government of India press their objection to the use of the phrase ’’native vessels”, a radical modification of the provisions in question would Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l. probably■'*«'» '-T' i . .. vppgp probaoly be necessary. V/hether such a modification of the Convent ion at this late date would be practicable, and, if practicable, desirable, the Board cannot say. In any case, they venture to suggest that the Secretary of State may desire to convene an inter-departmental conference to discuss, the position, the Conference to consist of representatives of your Department, the India Office, the Colonial Office, the Admiralty and of this Department.

No.2634. The Government of India will see that no decision was taken on the proposal that a Conference of signatories should be summoned with the object of bringing the Convention into force as soon as possible, and the question was adjourned. It is understood that it is not likely that the question will be taken up again until further progress has been made with the Convention for the Limitation and Reduction of Armaments and the Convention for the Prevention of Private Manufacture and Publicity of State Manufacture of Arms, as the three subjects are too closely interconnected. In these circumstances the question of the possibility of revising Chapter 3 is not being pursued for the present. But as it will have to be taken up again sooner or later, the Secretary of State will be glad to receive any views which the Government of India may entertain in regard to the suggestion that an attempt might be made to obtain ^he revision of Chapter 3. It will be seen from the Council proceedings referred to above that the Persian delegate spoke in favour of a revision of the Convention.

E.&amp; 0.2406/1930. 6th May 1930. •I Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of 26th March, No. W 1277/72/95 as to the ratification by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of the Arms Traffic Convention and to say that he is taking steps to have the Government of India informed of the action taken by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom* The Government of India will, of course, consider their position in the light of this action. But, for reasons explained below, it seems desirable to Mr. Secretary Benn that Mr, Secretary Henderson should be informed without delay that the ratification of the Convention in its present form by India presents considerable difficulty. So far as Mr. Secretary Benn’s present information goes, the Government of India who are anxious that the traffic in arms should be rigidly controlled would be ready to agree to the ratification of the Convention for India were it not for the provisions in Chapter 3 of the Convention relating to the special maritime zone. These provisions present several minor difficulties of which that referred to in this Department’s letter of the 4th February last, No. E.&amp; 0.662/ 30, is one. These difficulties relate to points of detail and are probably not insuperable. The main objection of the Government of India to the Convention in its present form, an objection with which the Secretary of State for India is in sympathy, is due to the fact that under Chapter 3 disabilities and liabilities are applied to vessels not exceeding a certain tonnage within | rlle Under Secretary of State, the/ I 10 reign Office.the special zone not on a general, but on a discriminatory basis. That is to say, the prescribed regime affects vessels of less than 500 tons only if they are owned, fitted out or commanded by natives of countries bordering on the specified maritime area or if at least one half of the crew are natives of such countries. Mr. Secretary Henderson is aware that the vessels of the French possessions in the southern part of the Indian Ocean are excluded from this regime and that the Persian representative withdrew from the Conference of 192fe when these provisions were adopted. Mr. Secretary Henderson is also aware that when an undertaking to negotiate a general convention which would contain similar provisions was inserted in the Slavery Convention of 1926, the Indian delegate, on signing that Convention, declared that his signature was not binding insofar as Article 3 of the Convention might require India to enter into an agreement which would place her vessels in a position different from that oi other States signatories of the Convention. It appears to be certain that in India such discrimination in the case of the Arms Traffic Convention will be regarded as invidious and the Government of India have stated that it would not be tolfi rated; in these circumstances ratification by India would be impossible. The objection applies not to the regime itself, but to its application with discriminatory effect. The regime if generally applicable, would be advantageous to India as a means of controlling the traffic in arms, and indeed without it the value of the Convention to India would be seriously diminished. In fact it is desirable, from the Indian point of view,- that the discriminatory provisions should be removed from the Convention, not mere ^ c h itat e/facilitate the ratification of India, but to make possible the accession of other countries in particular Persia -vithout whose accession the value of the regime of 'the special maritime zone would be greatly reduced. Among other reasons for which it is desirable that ratification in respect of India should be made possible, attention is called (l) to Article 26 of the Convention under which awkward questions may arise if the ratification of Kis Majesty 1 s Government in the United kingdom becomes effective and the Convention is not ratified for India; and (2) to the confusion which will result if ships flying the British flag which come from East Africa are liable to the speoial regime while those coming from India are not. Mr. Secretary Benn understands that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have placed upon the ^ Agenda of the next meeting of the Council of the League a proposal for summoning a conference of signatory States to consider the best means of bringing the Convention into force with the least possible delay. The object of this letter is to suggest that Kr. Secretary Henderson should consider the possibility of securing that this Conference if agreed to, should be free to undertake a revision of Chapter 3 of the Convention as one of the means of bringing the Convention into force.

Sir, With reference to the Viceroy’s foreign and Political Department telegram of 19th August, 1925, No. 1460-3, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the Government of India’s information, copy of a letter dated 26th March from the Foreign Office, giving the terms of the contingent ratification of the Convention by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and a copy of a circular dated 7th March, from the Secretary General to the League of Nations in regard to a proposal for summoning a Conference with the object of bringing the Convention into early effect, which His Majesty's Government have placed upon the Agenda of the next meeting of the Council of the League. , __p cj+o+p has no desire to question the The Secretary of State vie, expressed W &lt;».

Re has accordingly caused a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, to be addressed to the Foreign Office suggesting that the British representative on the Council should consider the possibility of securing that the proposed Conference, if held, should be free to undertake a revision of Chapter 3 of the Convention. The Secretary of State has not overlooked the difficulties of a practical nature described in the second part of the Government of India’s telegram quoted above. But he has no doubt that these difficulties may be regarded as being of a minor character and not as insuperable, provided that the general objection to the discriminatory nature of the regime in the special maritime zone is removed. The Government of India will, for instance, see from the Board of Trade letter of 8th February 1330, of which a copy is encloeed, that the second objection enumerated by the Government of India in 1926, which the./ described as the most important of them, is not considered by the Board of Trade to involve any necessity for amending the British Merchant Shipping Act before the ratification of the Convention in view of the fact that the Convention of 1925 did not, in this respect, introduce any change into the situation which has existed for many years.

Lord Passfield notes that the Board of Trade do not consider it necessary to introduce legislation at present specially to amend Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, having regard to the fact that no difficulty has arisen under the Articles in the Act of Brussels of 1890 and the unratified Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, which are practically identical with Article 22 of the Convention of 1925. He proposes, therefore, when informing Colonial Governments of the ratification of the Convention, to call the attention of all maritime Colonies, protectorates and Mandated Territories in the Special Zone to Article 22 of the Convention and to ask them to consider whether any local legislation is necessary to enable them to give effect to it .

MERCARTIL3 MARINE DEPART!£E1?T , BOARD OP TRADE, GREAT GEORGE STREET, WESTMINSTER, S.W.l. 8th February, 1930. Sir, With reference to your letter of the Uth January (No.61013/29) regarding the difficulty arising under Article 22 of the Arms Traffic Convention in its relation to Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, I am directed by the Board of Trade to point out that Article 22 of the Convention is identical with Article 14 of the unratified Arms Traffic Convention signed at St. Germain en Laye in 1919, which, in its turn, is practically identical with Articles 32 to 34 of the Act of Brussels of 1890. The Act of Brussels was ratified by and has been binding on His Majesty’s Government since 1892. So far, therefore, as the Board are aware, the ratification of the Convention would not, so far as concerns Article 22, place on His Majesty’s Government any obligations other than those which they assumed nearly forty years ago. It is, of course, true that the area covered by the Convention of 1925 is not identical with that covered by the Act of Brussels. So far as the Board are aware, no difficulty has arisen on account of Articles 32-34 of the Act of Brussels and while there may be a technical inconsistency between these provisions and the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act above referred to, the Board do not believe that any difficulty will be found to arise in the future or that there can be any pressing need for an amendment of the Merchant Shipping Acts on thisS6 Uis ground alone, particularly as the only Department really concerned with Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, is the Board of Trade. It is intended to amend the Merchant Shipping Acts when opportunity offers and this point will he home in mind in that connection. The Board do not consider, however, that the technical point raised in your letter need constitute any har to ratification hy His Majesty^ Government, if such ratification should he decided upon on other grounds. Nor do the Board consider that the ratification of the Convention would justify the introduction of Merchant Shipping amendment legislation until a convenient opportunity arises. In so far as legislation is necessary in the Colonies and Protectorates to give effect to Article 22 the Board can only suggest that it might follow the lines of legislation (if any) already in force in those territories to which the corresponding provisions of the Brussels Act are now applicable.

In reply to your letter of the 23rd January, No.W.72/72/95, on the subject of the ratification of the Arms xraffle convention, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Benn to say tnat he has no observations to offer on the modification which it is proposed to make in the form of reservation quoted in your letter of the 10th December. When His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have decided upon the terms in which they are prepared to ratify the Convention, Mr. Secretary Benn will communicate with the Government of India with the object of ascertaining their present views as to the ratification of the Convention for India. When the ratification of the Convention was under consideration in 1926, one of the difficulties which the Government of India found in agreeing to the ratification of the Convention on behalf of India had reference to Article 22 of the Convention and Section 2 of Annexe 2, which, read together, provide that no authorisation to fly the ulag of any of the high contracting parties shall be granted to ships of less than 500 tons as defined in Article 20, except by specified authorities and subject to specified conditions, and that such authorisation, when granted, shall ce subject to annual renewal. The Government of India considered that these provisions were in conflict with Section 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and that amendment of that Act by the British Parliament would be This point appeared to affect other parts of the British necessary.Brit-Mi ** 1 T' - .T British Empire than India pp -r^v* * cm inaia as, for instance, Ceylon and Kenya, and the Colonial Office, in a letter dated 8th November, 1926, addressed to the Board of Trade, expressed their concurrence in the view of this Office that legiaiation by the Imperial Parliament would be necessary to give effect to the clauses of the Convention in question. In view of the more general difficulties in the way of ratification, this particular point was not at that time further pursued, vide Mr. R.H. Campbell ’ s letter of the 3rd November, No.W. 1020/900/95 to the Board of Trade, and Mr. Secretaiy Benn is not aware that it has ever been finally settled. Mr. Secretary Benn would find it convenient to be able to inform the Government of India what view is now held as to the necessity for amending the Merchant Shipping Act and, if it is intended to legislate, whether legislation will be undertaken before or after the conditional ratification of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is deposited.

With reference to your letter of the 10th December (ho. W 10885/2020/95) regarding the ratification of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the information of Mr. Secretary Henderson, that they concur in the terms of the reservation which it is proposed to attach to the ratification of the Convention. I am to take the opportunity of pointing out that if and when the Convention becomes effective fresh powers will have to be obtained by Order in Council and certain changes will be necessary in the administration of the Export Licensing system in this country. A period of notice is therefore necessary to enable the provisions of the Convention to be brought into force in this country. The Board are not quite clear as to the effect of Article 41 of the Convention when ratification is made subject to such a condition as that proposed, but they assume that it would secure four months 1 notice of the actual date on which the Convention was to come into force in respect of the United Kingdom. If this is not so, it will be necessary, in their view, to amend the reservation in such a way as to secure the requisite interval between effective ratification and the coming into force of the Convention.

Sir, I am directed by Dr. Secretary Henderson to inform you that at the last Assembly of the League of Nations Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, then principal delegate of Kis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom made the following statement in regard to the ratification of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925:- 'I am now able to state that the British Government 'have decided to ratify the Arms Traffic Convention. We 'very earnestly hope that all the other states which have 'signed it will be able to ratify it. There is one 'condition, perhaps, which I ought to add. The Convention 'deals with the traffic in arms and naturally affects, in a 'special degree, those countries which are producers of 'arms. It would be quite useless for one such producing 'country to sign and ratify unless the others did the same, 'and it will be a matter for consideration whether, in 'ratifying that Convention, the British Government shall 'not attach to it a condition that its ratification will 'only become effective when certain other countries have 'also ratified the same Convention'. 2 . The Secretary of State considers that this under- taking should be implemented at the earliest possible moment and he proposes to advise The King to ratify the Convention in respect of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and all parts of the British Empire which are not separate members of the he Under-Secretary of State, India Office.the League of i,at ions, subject to the follov/ing reservation:- ’’Provided, however that this Our Ratification shall ’'not take effect until ratifications of the said Convention, 'in respect of all of the following Powers and States, that 'is to say, Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Italy, 'Japan, Spain, Sweden and the United States of America, shall 'also have been deposited with the Government of the French 'Republic in accordance with Article 40 of the said Convention', 3.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th of October (C.R.T.3964/26) regarding the ratification of the Arms Traffic Convention, 1925. 2. I am to request you to inform the Board of Trade that the views expressed in the letter from this Department of the 8th of October, regarding the supplementary legislation required to enable native vessels under 500 tons to fly the flag of any of the High Contracting Parties to the Convention should be regarded as applying only to native vessels which are not British ships, and that, so far as British ships are concerned, Mr. Amery is in agreement with the views expressed in the letter from the India Office of the 10th of September that legislation by the Imperial Parliament would be necessary to give effect to the clauses of the Convention in question* 3. Mr. Amery is advised that, so far as British vessels belonging to British subjects are concerned, sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act must apply, and that it is not within the competence of the legislative of a British possession to use its powers under section 735 of the Act to legislate with regard to such provisions of Part I as deal with the registration of vessels and the flying of flags. So far as native vessels belonging to British-protected persons are concerned, fHE ASSISTANT SECRETARY, MERCANTILE MARINE DEPARTMENT, BOARD OE TRADE.concerned, there seems to he no doubt that a Colony or Protectorate can pass legislation in such matters, as has already been done by the Colony of Kenya with regard to the flying by native vessels of the flag of one of the signatory Powers of the Convention of 1919 revising the General Act of Berlin and the General Act and Declaration of Brussels. 4. Pi.e difficulty in the present case appears to i.ir. Amery to be that a ’’native vessel', as defined in Article 20 of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, may be either British- owned or native-owned, and that it is only with regard to a native-owned vessel that a Colony or Protectorate can legislate. 5.

The question of ratification in its general aspect has been considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence, who decided that it would be inadvisable for Great Britain to ratify unless the other arms producing states did so also. The Committee accordingly requested the Foreign Office to endeavour to come to an understanding with the other producing states in order to fix a date on which the Arms Traffic Convention should he ratified simultaneously (see letter from the Committee of Imperial Defence of February 3rd last). 3. The following is a summary of the replies which .iave been received to the representations addressed to the governments concerned: ^ g „d Czechoslovakia are prepared to ratify on any date which may he agreed upon hy the arms-producing States.

It appears that the British ratification of the convention must he definitely postponed, unless the policy recommended by the Committee of Imperial Defence is to he reversed. In the circumstances the Secretary of State considers that problems arising out of the application of the convention are at present of purely academic interest and he recommends that their consideration should he deferred at all events until there is some prospect of the ratification of the convention.

Mr. Amery is advised that the provisions of sections 75 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, are not sufficient to ensure compliance with Article 22 of the Convention and that supplementary legislation is required providing that native vessels under 500 tons shall not fly the flag of any of the high Contracting Parties unless they have heen specially authorised to do so in accordance with Article 22 of the Convention and with the conditions prescribed in Section II, i I 3 and 4 of Annex II to the Convention. 3. Mr. Amery considers that in order to meet individu local requirements, such legislation should he passed, not in the form of an Amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, by the imperial Parliament as suggested by the Government of India, but by the legislatures of the various dependencies which adhere to the Convention, a*d that it should lay down (l) who is to issue C omme r c ial felafion^’and Treaties Department, Board of Trade.—’—, ■ ■ ■ s— '• . i ; i', issue the authorisation, (2) hor application for the authorisation is to he made (3) the form the authorisation should take, and (4) whether a fee should he charged. 4.

One of their difficulties has reference to Article 22 of the Convention and Section II of Annex II, which read together provide that no authorisation to fly the flag of any o* the High Contracting parties shall be granted to native ships of less than 500 tons (net tonnage) as defined in Article 20, except by specified authorities and subject to specified conditions; and that such authorisation when granted shall be subject to annual renewal. The Government of India say that these provisions conflict with Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1694, and that amendment of that Act ty the British Parliament would therefore he necessary if they were to ratify the Convent ion.

We have carefully scrutinised the Convention and could have ratified it were it not for the definition of ’’native vessels” contained in Article No.20, which was apparently substituted for that of the original draft as a result of inter-departmental conference of 23rd April, 1925. With the exception of part of Burma, all India falls within the area of the definition, and all Indian vessels would be classed as ’’native” whether they belong to the Indian Mercantile Marine or new Indian Navy, as also would be many British and foreign steamers, like those of P. and 0. Steam Navigation Company, containing a predominantly Lascar crew. It is clear that Indian public opinion will not tolerate such a definition contained in an International Convention.rtr/ia.

Received 18th August, 1926. 4 p.m. XX 1460-S. Seconds Last Part. The definition would also involve difficulties of a practical nature, (l) all native, and so Indian, vessels would he required to carry manifests inside the special zones, (Annexe No.21) while those less than 500 tons would also, (2) have to obtain authorisation to fly the Red Ensign (Article 22), and (3) be liable to search within special zones (Annexe 2). To the third of these difficulties there are objections of the same nature as to the definition itself. The first could be enforced under the existing law, but would cause grave inconvenience, for it is to Lascar ships owned by important companies and managed by reputable agents that the concession of sailing without a manifest is granted under Section 66 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878. The second is perhaps the most important however, for it conflicts with Sections 73 and 74 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. Amendment of that Act by the British Parliament would, therefore, be necessary if we were to ratify the Convention. But practical difficulties aside, we feel that we cannot accept for India the stigma implies in the definition of Article 20, and if it cannot be amended we see no alternative to refusing to ratify.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002d1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2182</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002d1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2182</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/14 'Persia and Persian Gulf: suggested Anglo-Persian Arms Traffic Agreement.

The volume also contains a number of communications received from members of the Persian Government (Muhammad Ali Foroughi [Furūghī], Abdolhossein Teymourtache, and Anoushirvan Khan Sepahbodi).The material principally concerns negotiations between the Persian [Iranian] and British Governments. The Persian Government wished to have the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman excluded from the list of special maritime zones, and sought British support in achieving this at the Conference. In response to British concerns about the possible impact on their ability to effectively limit the transport of arms and slaves in the region, the Persian Government proposed a bilateral Anglo-Persian treaty.The following topics are discussed in depth:general Anglo-Persian relations, and the British desire to make progress with regards to the position of Henjam;the traffic in arms and slaves in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea;the reluctance of several nations to ratify the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention;the definition and designation of 'special zones', 'special maritime zones' and 'native vessels' within the proposed conventions;the proposed bilateral treaty, its terms and conditions;the rights to inspect foreign vessels in the Persian Gulf, and British concerns over the ability of Persia to inspect British, Indian and Gulf vessels;the possibility of enabling other nations to accede to the bilateral treaty separately, to enable British inspection of the vessels of other nations within the Persian Gulf;and the concerns of the Admiralty over the potential impact that the agreement would have on their ability to police the traffic in arms and slaves.The following are particular items of interest:memorandum of the Persian Delegation to the League of Nations, noting their objections to the Arms Traffic Convention, ff 517-522;communication from HM Legation to Tehran, enclosing details of an interview with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for the Court (Foroughi and Teymourtache), ff 492-500;minutes of the Interdepartmental Cabinet Committee on the International Disarmament Conference, ff 394-420;details of a meeting between the Foreign Office and the Persian Minister to Switzerland (Sepahbodi), ff 185-192;Persian Government aide-mémoire on the progress of the negotiations, ff 121-124.The volume includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>United Kingdom Delegate to the League of Nations Disarmament Conference</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gulf of Oman </geographic></subject><subject><topic>Slavery</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><subject><topic>Unlawful trafficking</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002d1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
