For over a generation after the discovery in the United States of America that wells had to be t drilled for hundreds of feet into the earth before there was i ny chance of oil in commercial quantities .? t being secured, the Persian fields lay untouched, none of the great oil companies of the World linking t* •. . . •; upon them as of sufficient value to repay the heavy cost of sinking Ust wells in the regions remote from the sea where it was thought oil might possibly be found. Today Persia stands in the forefront of the world s oil producing countries, and last year the national exchequer received over JP. 500,000 from royalties abrnr paid upon tin oil. In addition the Anglo Persian Oil Company that year paid in wages to 20,000 subjects of the Hiah for work done in the Oilfields, Refinery, and other places, the colossal sum of 1,100,000 while many thousands ot other Porsiaus who supjdied the great industry with foodstuffs and materials, shared between iht m the further huge sum of ^ 400,000 spent locally by the Company on these supplies. These are some of the wonderful results that have come to Persia f«om the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, an enterprise that in little more than ten sh rt years, and though seriously interrupted by the World War, has built up a vast industry, by far the mist important in Persia today, I in the distant regions ot Arabistan and the B^khtiari Country that helore ware looked upon as among the least valuable parts of the Shah’s domains. • '•* ■ ■■ O'. ^ . , To the enterprise of one man-;he late William Knox D’Arcv, a New Zialander hv birth —Persia owes a great debt af gratitude, for \i him must In given the credit for first discovering the oil wealth of the country. Mr. D’Arcy, who had made a fortune by developing the copper irdustry in Australia, became interested in Persia, where he believed, in spite of the failure of earlier exp’orers, that oil • .. . ....../ il Securiug at considerable expense the concession then looked upon by others as of very doubtful value, he sent his drillers in the year 1901 to the area of Chia Sourkh, north-east of Baghdad, where for many years a primitive oil industry b*d been established at Kasr-i Shirh.. After considerable work had been done, oil was obtained at this point, but it proved to hare only a local value as the region was too far from the sea to allow a pipe-line to be laid through Persian territory tn order that the oil could be shipped to the great world markets. Undiscouraged by hi« flrst disappointment, Ifr D’Arcy sent his drillers to bore fresh wells at a point near Ran) Hormuz in the Karun River area. These tests gave poor results, and Mr.D'Arey having spent by this time close upon 3»0,OtiO of bis personal fortune, was at last forced to look for financial help elsewhere. By good fortune he was able to interest in his project the Burma!) PH Company, which had developed a great oil business In India, and the late Lord Strathcona, High Commissioner for Canada in London, one of the founders ef the great Canadian Pacific Railway. Finally success came to Mr. D’Arcy, after seven years in all had been spent in driliing test wells in these various areas, when his drillers, then engaged in testing the area of Maidaiw-Naftan about twenty Miles east of the Karim River on the track between Malamir and Shuiter, struck oil in paving quantities. But though huu Ireof tliousati Is of pounds had already bsen spent up to this point in the search for the precious oil, this was but the beginning of furtlur vast outlay before the oil could be refmed aud delivered to the markets of the world. It is a point generally forgotten that oil in the earth is of no value until great sums of money have been spent on wells, storage tanks, pipe-line, tank steamers, refineries, and ail the elaborate organisation needed for marketing the refined products. Before therefore the newly-found oil could be sold, all these had to be provided. Such a programme was too vast for any but a great Company able to call upon its shareholders for liberal supplies of capital. Accordingly there was brought into being the Anglc-Persian Oil Company, in whose subsequent success, as was fitting, the people of the two great Kmpires of Persia and Great Britain were to share. Very soon this new enterprise, like a young Rustam, was challenging the great companies which up to that time had monopolised the oil trade of the world. Some idea of what it has cost to bring the Persian oil iudustrv to its present position may be^ to liftj gti Pirsiai y lUl first oz in thti close upoD By jooil id a great one of tie rilling test M-Naftoa nek oil in int in the could he the earth ne, tank ;$. Before ireholdifl Coffipwii and Breat the great 3 |j gained when it is known that British investors lure hem called upon to provide close upon J?\20 000 000 of capital for the Anglo Persian Oil Company besides lending other great stuns to the Company on de bentures. Added to this, each year large amounts of money have been spent out of earnings to help supply the immense plant recessary to carry on the business. When Mr. B'A rev's geologists and engineers first visited the area of Maidan-i-Nafiun, they fou- J| d the district almost cut off from the world by rough mountains and deep gorges, with no roads, and only mule tracks linking it with Shuster, and thence with Isfahan, Tehran, and the other chief centres j of 1 ersia. Ihe Maidan itselt was a barren, desolate region, almost unbearably hot in summer, and du- | ring the rainy season the sorroundirg country was a morass of sticky gatch, mud and boulders. Ihe first exporers had to drag in their heavy boilers and drilling material as best they could hv mule team and waggon o\er Ihe mule tracks which took the p'ace of roads. To transport ihe thou sands of tons ot heavy material for the new wells, powerful pumping stations, storage tanks, pipeline, and the buildings for the oil-lielu stalf, roads were absolutely necessary, so Ihe first work of the Com pany s engineers was the making ot a road oetween Ber-i-Khazineh, ihe point to which steamers came on the Upper Kanin River, and Maidan-i-Naftun. One of the Roads built by the Company in the Oilfield Area. This first road followed the Tembi River for part of its length, crossing and recrossing the river at taiiotis points by ford, but as during Ihe rainy season it could not be used owing to the flood, a second more elaborate road was next constructed, great shelves being cut in the mountain skies to car-|| ry it. Over this ruad at the present time trains of motor lorries pass day and night eairying most of j; lhe material needed for the fields. As the great work has grown, even this second road has not proved sntlicient for the iraftic, so the Company has now built a railroad, the first of any length in 1 ersia, which will soon link the oil fields with the Karim River and thus with the sea. One of the most difficult pieces of work which the Company’s engineers had to do was to lay the heavy pipe-line over two ranges of hills, the Imau Ri/a and Till Khayat, which lay between Mai- dan-i-Naftun and Alnvaz, and which at their highest point reach an elevation of 1,300 feet above the refinery built by the Company at Abadan. Twenty miles of this hill section iiad to he laid where no roads existed, the pipe being carried by double mule teams over tracks cut and blasted in the hill side. Four mules were needed to carry a single length of pipe 20 feet long and weighing 820 pounds, the pipe being slung from wooden bars joining the saddles of each pair of mules. It was not until the year 1913 that the colossal task of building the pipe-lines, refinery and other || work was complete enough to allow any quantity of oil to he shipped, hut in the ten years since that date so rapidly has (he work grown as to place Persia today in the fourth place among the great oil- producing countries of the whole world, only the United Stales of America, Mexico and Russia produc ing more oil. Only by the operations of one great Company able to employ the most capable oil engineers am drillers in the fields, and to provide the large amount of capilal required for all the work of refining and distributing its oil, could the Persian oilfields have been developed at so rapid a rate as they have been. Hie people of Persia are therefore to be congratulated upon the wisdom of their rulers, who in stead of dividing up the oil concession among a lot of small companies, entrusted it entire to Mr.D’Ar- cy, through whom the Anglo Persian Oil Company was formed. Countries such as Roumania, Galicia, Egypt, and Trinidad, where oil industries operated by nu ll mfirous sma!i com l )anies llilve been in existence for from two to three times as long as the An 'do Per sian Oil Company, show the poor results that follow from competition of this kind. Too often the sma ll oil company is not out to produce oil hut to hold its area until some other Company is ready to ° fter a ]llg] l pri( ‘ e lor i( - Even vvlien a rea! attem Pt is made to find oil, the small producer has not sufficient ^ .

Even where a number of larger oil companies arc competiting against one another as in Mexi co and parts of the t nited States, the results are bad for the country, as such competition leads to waste, resulting in the oil fields being exhausted very early. This has been the c,m particularly in Mexico where a whole great field has been ruined, and as a consequence the Mexican Government is now faced with loss of revenue from the oil. No such fear exists for Persia, for from the start the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has worked carefully to produce and ship to market the greatest amount of oil possible but without waste or in jury to the valuable oilfields. The Persian Government can therefore look with confidence for a steady and substantial revenue from its oilfields for many years to come. Great as are the financial benefits already mentioned, which ihc people of Persia are receiving from the oil industry, these by no means exhaust the advantages that the nation has obtained from the presence of the Anglo-Persian Company. In regions where formerly (here were only a few scattered peasants earning a precarious living, today arc found towns given over almost entirely !• the oil indns- ti'}. On the Island of Abadan a great refinery has been developed, and at Mohammerah, Ahwaz, Tembi, Maidan-i-Naftun and many other points the Company lias built great works and helped to develop the towns and villages on modern lines. Everywhere fine roads have been built which the population make use of, and on the Kanin Itiver a great river service has been established, Added to these works, tin Company has built and maintains at bis own expense tbree-fnl y- equipped modern hospitals, thereby providing full medical service for the population as well as for the Company s workers. In Tehran itself the Company contributes to the support of a fourth hospital, and as a further benefit it is now trying to have established technical schools in which Persian youths can be trained for the more scientific work of the oil industry. Socli brief!) describes the history and work of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the most impor tant single enterprise in Persia today, and the one which is doing the most to restore the ancient pros pei it\ of the Empire of the Shahs. It was a fortunate circumstance for Persia'that to a subject of Great Britain, whose Government for generations has been the firm friend of Persia, should have fallen*■ »■ ; i 6 the lot of discovering iltese great oilfields, and equally fortunate that British f&lt; risk the great sums of money without which the oilfields were worthless. capital was prepared to WINNING AND REFINING OF THE OIL Drilling- The method by which the source of oil is tapped at Maidan-i-Naftun is called the Percussion I System. In this system the strata are perforated and broken up by successive blows of a heav\ steel bit screwed into a weighty iron rod wdiich is in turn attached to a device enabling the bit to luohe a sharp jar on the upward stroke fresing it should it have become jammed. Above this again is a second heavy iron rod which is attached to a steel cable. The string of tools thus constituted is suspended from one end of massive steel beam pivoted at the Centre, the other end of this beam is connected with a crank on a horizontal shaft driven by a steam Engine. Oscillating motion is thus imparted to the beam and vertical reciprocating motion to the string I of tools ending with the bit. - Oilfield Scene showing Derr irks used for d rilling Wells.4 / (:2~ V Pumping to the sea coast. The oil having been thus tapped is conveyed through steel tubes to the Refinery at Abadan. For this purpose four Pumping Stations are necessary each fitted with powerful Turbo Pumps driven by 1200 h. p. Steam turbines. View of Work* at Tembi with Pumping and Electric Power Station Refinery After a journey of 150 miles the oil arrives at the Refinery at Abadan. In planning the refinery every advantage was taken of the knowledge gained from practical ex perience in other refineries through-out the world, and from the studies of the Company’s slaff of re search chemists, who for some years past have been closely examining the properties of Persian Oil with Laying Pipe-Line over Desert Pipe* Bending Operation. i i\i- a view to securing from it the best possible products. The result is a plan whirl, embodies all the la test improvements, and which in layout, efficiency, and economy of operation takes second place to no plant of its kind in the world. The refining of Petroleum is a lengthy operation, consisting in the lirst place of a disiillatiou process for separating the oil into the various fractions from which, later, the petrols, lamp oil, lubricants, etc. arc made. This is followed by chemical treatment for the purification of the several distillates, and sometimes, as in the present instance, by refrigeration lor the removal ot the solid paraffins and the subsequent refining of these hy a heating process known as sweating. The system of distillation For the first treatment of the crude oil, the continuous system of distillation is employed at Aba- ; dan, the oil passing through various units in a constant stream. The most volatile fractions, 'which form the basis of petrol and kerosene, are first separated; then the others in order oi their volatility. Maximum economy of fuel is secured by the introduction oi heat interchangers, these utilising tiie heat from the vapours of the stills and from certain residue to raise tne temperature of the cold oil entering I the system. Section of the Refinery at Abadan, A badly planned refinery can be extremely wasteful of fuel, hut, at Abadan the question of heat conservation has been carefully considered so that the total fuel consumption is maintained at an ex tremely low figure.9 The progress of the oil through the refinery is marked by changes of colour at every stage, and from the dull black crude after the various processes have been completed, there comes the colourless petrol and gleaming white wax. From the tank farm the crude oil is pumped to the refinery, where it passes through the first | distillation process already referred to, the distillate, from which petrol and kerosene are derived, being practically white in colour. The residue flowing from this series of stills may be disposed of as Fuel Oil, or it may be fully refined and converted into various heavier products which it contains, such as gas oil, lubricate, tar, j! and, pitch. yr, | . | r J Motor spirit and kerosene- Following the distillate from the Crude Oil stills, it is transferred to the Benzine Refinery, and there agitated in an upright vessel, known as a washer, with a solution of caustic soda, being partially deodorized in the proc&lt;ss. The distillate so treated is then passed to the Benzine Rectificatitn stills, 1 where it is split into such fractions as the market demands at the moment petrol and kerosene. The petrol, even at this stage, has still a fairly strong odour. It is returned, therefore, to the Benzine Refinery, where it receives its final treatment to remove sulphur and to deodorize it. In this j process the petrol is agitated with a solution prepared by electrolysis, this solution being prepared at j ' the refinery in a special section of plant. The kerosene or lamp oil, undergoes a special filtration process through Granular Bauxite, pre pared in a particular manner. From this process the oil comes SAveet in odour and perfectly colourless, being, in fact, the highest grade of kerosene. Both the petrol and kerosene, now ready for the market, are transferred to their respective sto rage tanks previous to delivery to the market. rr The making of wax ; j Aportion of the heavy residue from the Crude Oil slilis goes to other specially constructed stills, j where the intermediate and heavier fractions are separated. The heavier part, containing solid paraffin I and lubricating oils, is refrigerated, being cooled to a low temperature in an elaborate and specially-exudes through cloths. Oil removal from the presses the crude paraffin, technically known as ''scale,, undergoes its whitening process, the first stage of which is known as sweating, through bauxite, in which the colour is removed. 1 o-. The final stage consists of filtration The power plant The boiler house at Abadan is an important detail of the plant, for steam figures tery largely ! in the refinery operations. There are 2 huge steam turbo—generators, and thiee Inigo reciprocating sets which supply the electricity required to light the entire plant, and the stall houses, as well as to operate the numerous oil and water pumps, and for the electrolytic processes in the refinery itself. Oil firing is generally used throughout the refinery, and the immense plant provides an object lesson in the efficiency and convenience of this modern method of steam raising.m CONFIDENTIAL'.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Colonel Trevor’s despatch No. 16/205, of the 28th of March, in regard to the Anglo Persian Oil Company’s negotiations for oil concessions on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf, and to inform you that, after consultation with the Board of Taeade, I caused a letter, a copy of which is enclosed, to be addressed to the Company. 2. You will see that, as regards Bahrain and Kuwait, they have in accordance with Colonel Trevor’s suggestion been informed that unless they have successfully accomplish- -ed their objects by the 51st of March next, other companies will be allowed to institute negotiations on their own behalf. 5. I fully agree with Colonel Trevor that it would be most undesirable to allow the Anglo Persian Oil Company indefinitely to prolong the negotiations and thereby pre- -vent other companies having an opportunity of securing concessions in these areas. I should be glad to learn at an early date whether in fact the Anglo Persian Oil Company have made any material progress towards accomplishing their objects in either Bahrain or Kuws.it. 4. As regards the territory of the Shaikh of Q,atar, I note that Colonel Trevor considered that there would be little objection to throwing ppen this area also to compet- -ition, the Shaikh himself being anxious to negotiate a concession. As you will see in the enclosures to my despatch No. 6 of the 7th of Pebruary, while feeling bound to recognise the Anglo Persian Oil Company’s prior claims as regards Q.atar, I do not consider the present a suitable time on general political grounds, for negotiations to be instit- -uted, a.nd I find myself unable to modify my previous attitude so far as this area is conc'erned. 2.Enclosure to Colonial Office Despatch ho. 15 of 27th May 1924. 22811/19244 Downing Street, 27th May 1924.

You will doubtless agree that it is undesirable that negotiations should be prolonged further than is absolutely necessary, especially in view of the fact that other applications from companies have been received by His Majesty’s Government for facilities similar to those which have been afforded to yourselves. Mr. Thomas desires me to take this opportunity of stating for your Company’s information, that your claims to priority will be recognised as at present, up to the 31st of March next; but that should you have failed to accomplish your objects by that time, His Majesty’s Government will feel bound to entertain pro- -posals from other applicants to be allowed to proceed with the institution of negotiations for oil concessions in these areas.

I asked him if he would be willing to detail these to me privately in order that T might acquaint my Directors with his requirements and thus be in a position to immediately reply to any proposals that I might receive from you. His Hxcellency replied that public opinion constit uted a factor in these negotiations which it \ as impossible for him to disregard and that a Majlis was already sitting in Howeit to consider the terms for a Concession submitted t{ z ) ( goiiTiimsD ) Major Holmes and also the Draft Agreement submitted by the Colonial Office, the terms of which the Company had expressed its willingness to accept. I informed the Shaikh that if a geological examination of his territory was to be undertaken this cold season, it v/as very necessary that the geological party should be in the field not later than mid-October. I remarked that immediately the Agreement was definitely concluded v/e should be in a posi tion to place a fully-equipped geological survey party in the field, but that if the negotiations were delayed it would be difficult, if not impossible, to undertake this work until the autumn of 192 $.

Major Holmes accompanied 'by a Doctor Heim and a Mr. HadgwicM are reported to he about to proceed from Basrah to Bahrain in the near future. Ho doubt Holmes will, if time permits, pay his respects to the Sheikh of Kuwait on his way down the Gulf. Major Holmes appears to keep himself in sympathy with the advisers of the Sheikh of Kuwait, as also the advisers of .the Sheikh of Bahrain, by means of presents suitably distributed, and I fully realise the influence this action he.s on the Eastern mind. In considering our proposals for Concessions we are in a position to clearly demonstrate our ability to faithfully carry out the conditions of any Agreement we may enter into, which of course is not the case with the Eastern General Syndicate, who can, as in the case of Ibn Saud, only continue to prevaricate until they succeed in capitalising and floating a Company for any Concession obtained. Such concessions, when end if obtained, are of little if any real value until costly geological examina tion, followed by actual testing of certain areas, has been carried out. My own feeling; in this matter is that the advisers of the Sheikh of Kuwait will endeavour to hinder the Sheikh from actually granting the Concession as long as there is any prospect of their getting further bribes from Major Holmes, and it has therefore occurred to me that, if we were definitely in a posi tion to guarantee payment of suitable cash rewards immediately following the actual granting of a Concession to us, we might successfully overcome the antagonism to the Company which has been worked up by Major Holmes. I should very greatly appreciate your views in this connection and an indication of what you consider would be the total amount of suitable rewards. As promised, I shall be sending Mackie to Kuwait in the course of a couple of weeks. “i^h kind regards ana wishing Mrs. More and yourself a Happy Christmas and Hew Year * Major J. C. More, D.S.O., H.

The result of his enquiries is very much what one would h-ve expected: a number of people still look on the A.F.O.C. as a Government concern pure and simple, id object to it for th reason; others do not want an Oil concession to be given to anyone, partly because it would provide work for a large number of eople and thus make it harder to get pearl divers, * nd partly because they think it would lead to our Interfer ing In tut internal affaire of Kuwait, which they apparently have a great dread of.

My own opinion is that, if Holmes is to meet with any success, he cannot help watering the ground, which he would only do, as you suggest, through some Arab agent. I should only be’ inclined to adopt a similar action if assistance rendered led to our obtaining the Concession, whereafter presents promised would be distributed. I trust, however, that such action will not be necessary as it is distasteful, to say the least of it, and opposed to any procedure adopted by this Company in the past. I have just received a telegram from Mackie informing me that the Sheikh is still procrastinating and advising me that the only possible way of pushing matters is through the medium of Mulla Saleh- Mackie tells me that you are inclined to agree with this view, but consider that it would be very dangerous for Mackie himself to approach Mulla Saleh. I am therefore considering sending Mr. Williamson, down to Howeit. He is, as I think you know, our Gulf Agency inspector and he will go down ostensibly to look into agency matters in Howe it and will, of'course, deal direct with our Agent. I have explained matters to him and I will let you know if he is able to obtain any information by baok-door methods calculated to assist us. I am wiring Mackie accordingly.

I have recommended to London that we should pay Hull a Saleh a sum of £100/- down with a promise of a further sum of in the event of his being able to induce the Sheikh of Lowe it to grant us the Concession before the 31st of March. In asking you to communi cate with Haji Williamson I felt that, if we could indicate to Lulla Saleh rightaway that we were prepared to recompense him for services rendered, this indication might, pending definite sanction from London as to the amount, prevent him from flirt ing with Major holmes should the latter again appear on the scene. I enclose for your information a copy of Eaji v/illiam- son T s report to me, which you will agree is interesting, although' it does not afford much additional information. As you suggest, Williamson does not appreciate the reasons promoting the Sheikh’s desire to prevaricate during, the next two months, but this attitude is of course not surprising in that Major Holmes has already been told by the Political Resident that he will not be allowed to negotiate for oil at either Bahrain or Loweit until after April, as a result of which he has undoubtedly taken every precaution to ensure that the priority period granted to the Company by the Colonial Office is of little or no real value to us. In a report from Mackie at Bahrain he now informs me that Daly has told him that, prior to the abdication of Sheikh Isa in favour of his son Sheikh Hamad, the Bahrein Concession had definitely been granted to Holmes and that, although Sheikh Hamad would be quite willing to enter into negotiations with the Company, he nevertheless feels that he is unable to go back on any undertaking given by his father as he feels that this will cause his father (with whom he is by^no means on good terms) to intrigue against him. Really it_ is a nice position all round and from what i can see of it the Colonial Office priority, whilst not assisting us, is in^actual fact merely delaying the ratification of the concession at either Bahrain or Loweit to anybody.

ITDUPLICATE ENCLOSURE TO DESPATCH TrL No, - ^ ■ J OF ^ - Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, iii.C. 2 . 30th October, 1925. Bear Sir John, 1 am very glad to hear of your recovery,which I hope will not be undone by an excess© of work on your return to office. A question has arisen here which I think can better be explained in a personal letter. Professor de Boekh,of whose international repute you are aware,has recently visited our Persian Melds as our Chief ecological Adviser. In his discussions with our Chief Geologist he laid great stress on the necessity for &amp; widening of our knowledge of the regional geology of the Persian Gulf, and xrrrjssed his desire for a traverse of the Kuwait &amp;rea in order to afford further material for his larger regional interpretations of Persian geology generally. On first learning of the proposal by our Geological Department to conduct a reconnaissance surgey in the Kuwait area in the coming cool season, I asked that definite arrangements be suspended pending your approval, foi incomplete negotiations for a concession by one department here and action by another, whi oh might be / interpreted as having an intentionally direct relation to tne concession question,might lead to misunderstanding. I do not suggest that any knowledge of the eunace geological indications in the Kuwait region would be Shuckburgh,K.C.M.G.be Yfcluelese to us in discussing &amp; concession for that ^ area,but I take it that if we hare the Sheik’s approval you will h-iv@ no objection to the proposed reconnaissance by two of our Geologists,since the question at issue between us over the Gulf concessions has no relation to the existence or non-existence of oil in those areas,or to the geological information which we are seeking for assistance in the interpretation of our Persian problems. Ifours sincerely, (Sgd) H .Ui chols .Britannic Houee. iJinebury Gircua, London ,i£. C.2. 23rd November, 1925.

(♦)• A route programme was prepared which would allow of examination of ail the principal features indicated on the maps of guweit territory, including the Jal Kjs 2 or, El y&amp;, Abatih and Samar ridges; jebel Sanam; the Batin valley as far as Riga!; the sh&amp;gg valley at its northern end; and the ieolated hills south west and south of Koweit, including eerooially jebel ^ a rail, Burgan, and dish rif (: asr es Birrah).

IX* 0 H Q 0 H A P ii Y * (8) . the region examined is a fairly even pi in rising gradually westwards from Sea level to about 800 feet at the further&amp;t point reached. rhe surface is never absolutely flat, but is always more or less etched by erosion into slight hollows and ridges. The hollows are sparsely covered with a growth of one or more speeics of aensb and grass, while the ridges are generally bare and covered with loose gravel. ( 9 ) * The major negative features of the country are the Batin and the Shagg, which are river-cut trenches; and K&lt;meit Bay, which Is regarded as the work of ifttyfut erosion. (IQ 5 • The Batin is a remarkably straight feature as re presented by the maps, and it was at first suspected that it might be a long, narrow rift-valley, yield evidence, how* ever, is against this. The Batin has been hollowed out by swiftly flowing water. The heavy rainfall giving rise to this must have occurred at a distance, - presumably in theV ( 3 } -*C central Arabian Aighlands, - for the main channel ha® been deepened more than the tributaries in the section examined, so that the latter tend to hang over the former in many cases. The deepening of the main en&amp;nne l shows at least three stages, as the banks, eepe daily near Ugai, show traces of two gravel capped terraces, about 2 J and 5 t) feet above U'K- r recent bottor r The &amp;&gt;*) th of the trench is perhaps Bo ft* at Higai, and diminishes gradval ly north wards . {11 )• Tne ;ha:|g , where examined, is a much shallower channel taan the Batin; and, on the groun ,, failed to give the impression of a straight trench that the maps convey. It appeared rather like a bundle of hollows, trending more or less north-north-west. The map shows it terminating in a broad shallow depression, without outlet to the Sea. (12) . a number of closed shallow depressions of this nature were seen- Their origin io not explained, but It is suspected that they art subsidences due to removal of under lying soluble materials by percolating min water. The existence of a soluble formation underground is, however, not proved by observation* ( 13 ) . The jal 11 Y&amp; is a low narrow elongated ridge, rising perhaps 2J feet above the plain. The regions called El Abatih and El Ham&amp;r are characterised by a succession of shallow wadis, draining mostly to East and North East, but in one section to South %«»t. The wadi bottoms tend to be sandy and scrub-covered, while the intervening ridges are gravelly and bare. (14). jebel Ganam (or the Hill of the oa el Hump) is just outside the Howeit border, but deserves mention because it i« an unique feature in this region. It ic a 1 : nd markrisible for 3c or miles around, and must hare been ©o for ages past, as it is a pinnacle of old rocks projecting above the shc-et of Young nediment® which covers the whole of the surface of Yoweit territory. (!?• . The Jai &gt;* r,or is the most prominent geographic feature in the neighbourhood of Koweit. it l a a sharp escarpment, precipitous in m.uny places, rising t&gt; over 4ou feet above sea level north jahrah. forthetwards the al titude decreases graduall y , until the ridge is cut off entirely by the Kb or S© 3abiyah. south 1 eet^ards, there is actually a rise to ever jfbo f^et, but the esoarprdent aies out at this point. The cliff face shows marked terraces at three levels opposite Jahrah, at about Jq, loo, and 2jb feet above sea level. The terme &amp; are determined by bands of slightly more resistant rook, but it sterns clear that they have b* en cut by the sea. rraces of marine deposits can occasionally b© seen on them. On top of the Jal Kz :or there is a narrow strip of flat land strewn with pebbles. Beyond this, the land surface sinks gradually, and is much dissected by ^auis draining to north-east. (16) . South of roweit, the land rises in the form of a low flat ridge, which at Jtbei \,&amp;rah is over 200 feet above sea level, jebel ! ama is an isolated block of indurated rock rising abruptly some 60 ft. above the surrounding country. The Burgan hills are of similar composition, but arc lower and less abrupt* Uishrif ( asr bb sirraii v , and numerous low flat-topi: d hills in the same neighb &gt;urhood, are also detemined by the presence of an t.n&amp;urutea stratum. rhey buq\ , in piacefc;-, relies of a capping of shelly grit, containing a species of Conus which is v ry abundant in the recent littoral formations.TH**# is tiiu*, MWI sea level in Uils region steoa in recent times i.') f®®% t and probably mors, above the present level. Jebei v.&amp;mh and the B‘ ; rgan hills are therefor# relics of marine erosion. III. S T 1 A T 1 0 R A p U Y t ( i'/’ • There ia a slight development of shelly sand (littoral concrete) on the present shore line at and near fto^eit, and on former #hore lines, a muddy shell rock is found in Kdwelt Bay aad on the lelande outside it (i’ailajah etc). These ar», of recent formation. Relatively recent aleo are the *Ji*t graveie**, which cap aatny of the emiaeaeee through ut in© northern part of roucit territory, und the terraces of the Batin valley, with the one exception of J«b&lt;?l Sanaa, ail the r aainder of the surface examined iu covered by the Kswelt aerits. This series is exposed to a de.th of same 45 o feet in the jul hz dor j se&amp;rpgtent north of Jahrah. it mtcrops all along the Batin an far as 'tigai, tvhere it has been penetmted by aid veils to a depth of over 100 ft* in some place® (Kulaiba and oulban •* l obeid); and it eeerts probable, from the description by philby, that the veils at Hafar are atso sunk in it. hi^hrif, v/arah and \ Burgan present a superficially altered farm of the same formation. (la'. Kowei t fjerlee. Those beds are typically famed of ouart* grit, or gritty and pebbly e^.nd, &gt;ft*»n felnpathic, and very often Viith a matrix of Phite argillaceous substance that seems to b« Kaolin. The quarts is translucent, anti the grains are relatively angular. The materials have clearly been derived from the waste of a m#a of decomposed medium grained granite, and have been washed down and deposited rapidly by flood water#, without much sorting, an grit particles and small l ebblea are found mixed indiscriminately through finer✓'-'w - ( 6 } . Materials. The Kao Uni c substance which aoimortly occurs as a matrix a® fouAd as a thin bed at Bargan* Tifcc-;wh6rt r argillaceous bands are rare, but frequently a ntrefik of reddish color appears on outcrops, and is found to be due to the presence a ^ferruginous argillaocous matrix in the grits. The most striking development of the sort Is seen on the south aide of the Burgan bill*;, where there is a section showing aorac Jb ft. of variegated beds, comprising not only the normal *rey and white F&amp;oiinio grits with a thin Kaolin bed, but also beds of pale green, yellow, red, purple and brown color. The colored argillaceous beds frequently contain thin plates and veinletu of selenite; and sometimes show a salt content by ths presence of an efflorescent crust of sodium chloride. (19;* Calcareous Cementation . The Koweit grits arc v?ry often found in a loose friable condition. But even in such cas 0 , they are characterised by an abundance of small or large concretions, which are move or less round masses of the rrit cemented into a coherent rock by carbonate of lime. In ,H&gt;st .sections, this calcareous cementation has .also produced ledgea of hard rock at intervals. The tor terraces are an inat nee of such selective cementation on a large scale. The roeks supporting the terraces ar^ coherent calcareous grits, while the inter vening beds are incoherent. (£q) . The Calcareous concent occasionally increase© still more, producing a rook which can be called a sanoy limestone* The sandy limestones in the Koweit a t ries are unite or grey, less often pink, and are sometimes rather coarsely crystaline* Sand grains oan, however, generally be seen even in the most crystalline varieties, and there is 4 gradation from line- stone to calcareous grit. The limestone 5 props* were never observed to attain c talekness greater tiian one or tvo feet.But beue of coherent calcareous grit up to 2 d ft- thick can be seen. ( 2 q&amp;). Cross beading is occa&amp;ionaily seen in tiie Ko^ 8 it grits, for oxuujic in the mas«iv« cliff of jebei dmrah. The true bedaing gives everywhere the improosion of hori- ssont&amp;lity, though the long section of the Jul na sor escarp ment seems to indicate a gradual dip north-eastwards. Tuia is the direction in which the sediments were originally carried, and no tectonic significance can he attached to the observation* (21'. It may be remark d at this stage that the assemblage of features described is rather pub sling. ' oetrital xaate rials from a predominantly granitic source have been washed down rapidly and deposited in an unsorted condition; an 2 though there are only rare traces of fossil shells, the resulting sediments have a high content of calcium carbonate, with subordinate but distinct traces of gypsum and sodium chloride, the latter - as is natural - associated with the more argillaceous members of the series* It could be opec ted that such a source of detritus would supply Alkali Carbonate, ;-nu not lime carbonate to any extent, one is tempted, there fore to suppose that the sediments ware piled up In an enclosed seta, free from currents* such a sea would heve a high salt content, and littls or no lime secreting fauna* It would, however, probably have a high calcium sulfate content. Calcium carbonate would thus bo imar ox&amp;tely preci pitated from the incoming 3 food waters, if, as supposed, the latter contain d alkali carbonate - \ Cased-t-Hag Co3 * 0*003M«t2 04.

The presence of 00 much kaolinic matter in the FOwelt grits implies that a great quantity of alkali carbonate was liberated at the earn* time - something approaching 2 / 7 th» of the weight of Kaolin. Some Ca C 03 would, of course, also be xonsed, as the felspar would probably net be pure aibite. Again, some of the felspar would be or the class, whion would give a higher rslatirs weight of carbonate than the Soda mineral. In the conditions Imagined, it is haraly too much to suppose that these decomposition products would hare accu mulated to same extent. ( 22 ). Si riel ideation. As already recorded by Mr.hister ju^rs, the irowelt grite at Burgan and w'arah show a rather remarkable sillci-fication. This* phenomsn m affect a ^nXy thi »upt rficlai b«?d» an tii-c Mil taps, viisrs they are mare ar less indu rated, and occasionally altered into dense splintery quartzite, in which there is no longer any trace of cal careous cement. The thickness of beds affected is seldom more than about ten feet. Underneath, the ordinary friable grits, with calcareous nodules and ledges, are found. Si Unification has clearly been a downward process, one specimen collected from below the hard quartzitic crust shows calcareous grit containing a geode lined with quartz crystals. T-iven the raoiinic bands are indurated when they are found on or near a hill top, producing a kina of poreellanite. The surface with which the silicification process ms associated lay above the level defined by the hilltops of &lt;*rah and Burgan, which are relics of denudation (23;. perhaps more remarkable still is the silicificatlon seen near Koweit, at Jfishrif (casr Ks Sirrah', and on a number of small hills between there and the Jahrah gate of Koweit. The rock affected here is a sandy limestone, which is quite often pink in color, but commonly gr.sy, and. highly crystalline. Geodes lined with caleite crystals are k ome- tiiacs abundant. The sand content varies a good deal. But even in the purest limestone, tubular masses of sand are frequent, .all gasteropod ait cl la aro visible in one epeci- men. This rock nearly everywhere shew* incipient replace ment by brown or black chert, and replacement is sometimes complete over large masses. The sand tubes are, however, frequently preserved where the surrounding limestone has been replaced. This indicates that the replacing medium expelled Calcium Carbonate with relative ease, but did not affect quartz grains - at any rate with the o&amp;rae facility. It was also observed that a small gasterujad shell waa silitified, while the sandy limes tune in which it was imbedded regain d untouched. This would indicate, probably,■ ' ( 4-6 ( 10 5 ■J+M a preference for aragonite on the purt of the silica solution. Underneath the hard cap fomed by the chert- Uaeetone bed, the Kowtit grits arc again found in the usual incoherent condition, with calcareous nodules. Alteration to Chert is entirely a superficial phenomenon, and is confined to rocks rich enough in Calcium Carbonate to be called limestones. Tt sccois clear that the same siliceous agent which changed lijaeetone to cnert, changed the ieos calcareous grit into a quartzite* (24-}. Mr.Lister James* description of jebei crain leaves no room for doubt that the Koweit series is found ther also ?*ith a cap of Kandy lim&gt; stone tartly replaced by chert. The silicification surface thus appears a© a plane, rising from roweit, *fcere it is found at 5 o ft. above sea level, or even less, to Mishrif (loo ft), over Jebel \mxmh and the Burgan hills, \hich must be about JoQ ft. to Jebel ^rain (perhaps 400 ft). The nature of the si Unification process is not clear. C*K.Leith has recently { .con.Geo 1 XX, 6 , 1925 p .513 - 523 } remarked on the frequent association of erosion surfaces and silicification; and aiiicification of surface rooks has been described from the Kalahari desert of southwest Africa. Silica appears, under appropriate conditions, to be a relatively soluble substance. But the best known condition for the solution of silica is the re^ence of Alkalis, it is just conceivable that sodium carbonate waters coming; from the granites of the Interior of Arabia may have been brought into action on thin elongated, and comparatively narrow strip of the Foweit series, by some accident of drainage after dopesi* tion had ceased. Thin is, of course, entirely a speculative idea, but it explains the apparent absence of chert and quartzite elsewhere in the roweit series. The superficial position now occupied by the Mishrif chert &amp;nd the Borgan - Warah quartzite would be due, on this line of reai oning, tothe ability of these hard rocke to arrest denudation for a tiiae. The fciiieification process ;may hare been active else where in the KoweIt series, but erosion has not reveiled it, because it has taken place underground v.hen surface waters containing silica in solution imTe been held up by a relatively impermeable limestone or calcareous grit. ( 2 §). Gypsum . It has already been mentioned that some of the more argillaceous beds of the roweit series ©how .gypsum in the form of thin plates and veinlete of Selenite. An attempt has been triads to indicate how this gypsum, and the salt which accompanies it, may hay© been derived from saline waters into which the Koweit sediment© were poured. But this is the least conspicuous occurrence of gypsum in Koweit. Almost universally, it can be found within a few inchen of the sur** face in the form of a loose mass of crystalline particles, enclosing grains of ©and, grit, mail pebbles, or lura; s of disintegrated i*ock from the local foraation. The thickness of this surface gypseous layer is variable, it may be only a few inches, but as much as 1 q feet has been seen. Occasion- fcily it has the apiear-nce of a solid bed, but closer inspec tion reveals impurities of various kinds, dependent on the local materials. The torn up ground around Kuweit town i® due to exploitation of this gypsum, which occurs as a cake 2 - 3 ft. thick, cementing the surface layers of Koweit grit. n top of the jai izz Zojt, and in numerous places in the Batin, gypsum crust could be found by digging a few inches into the loose grits of the surface, its origin was well displayed in some %adi section® near Shiqaiya (Batin), whore / a gypseous salty argillaceous bed \ms overlain by ordinary Calcareous grits. Thin gypsum vein© appeared in the argilla ceous bed, and became more numerous towards the sudface, until the 3-4 ft. of rock immediately unu&amp;r the surface was found( ) 'A-Zj to be ©earned in all direction© and thoroughly permeated with gypcujsu pccsibiy ame of the lime cement had been removed in thle process, for th«s material was no longer coherent* but could easily be powdered into a loose mane of which gypaust crystals were the most obvious constituent. (26) . The indurated .rocks of uishrif, faafah, and Burgan show trace® of a similar concentration of gypsum near the surface. The porous rocks underneath the hard cap are often found to be permeated with fine crystals, while the hard rooks are veined along joints, on a ^mall hill about H miles south of the Juhrah date, Koweit, the a&amp;ndy lime stone* where not replaced by chert* is strongly gypseous. Gaicite-lin© druses have fine gypsum crystals deposited in the space between the c&amp;icifce cry©talc. The whole rock, in places, appears to have been partially disintegrated, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that some of U « Ca Co 3 boon MtuaUy ctongod to gypaum, since lump, of limestone coated and permeated with gypsum can be found embedded in a powdery .mss of gypsum.. Sometimes, in fact, it appears as if only the sillcified part of the original limes tons bed had survived the attack of the gypsum as a kind of skeleton. (27) . In parenthesis, it may be*, here noted that the Kha rag island limestone shoft s a very simil&amp;r development of gypsum. The ou&amp;rry operation© have shown that the sur face rock to a depth of 2 - 3 often quite rotten, and contains abundant powdery gypsum crystals. The remainder of the rock is relatively hard and compact, but frequently shows a coating of gypsum along cracks. In one cose, a highly coralline layer in the limestone, about 6 inches thick, is reduced to a powder by growth of gypsum* Here again replacement of CaCoj by Ca ^ 04 .2 U 2 O is an observed facU The coralline structure is in some cases totally obliterated.Mr. 0 *?;;•&amp;#©Si fend, the writer have? observed a similar r-placement of coral by gypsum in a rleiBtocene raised-b ach at Titawe b, Sudan coast. There, as at Kh&amp;mg, the beds *Mch underlie the coral rock are highly gypseous. ( 28 ). Thors can he little doubt that the surface concentra- ' tion of gjrp&amp;m in the Kernelt Series is due to capillary rise and evaporation of sulfate-bearing solutions. The source of the sulfate must in most cases be the gypsum disseminated through the underlying strata. But in lorn-lying regions adjacent to the sea, if the ground is porous, suif&amp;t# tuny be derived directly from sea mtsr. Kr.hses and the *ri v«r observed this process of gypsum formation an the nod Sen coast at fort Sudan. The beach material mis composed of porous shelly sand, cheifly coral powder and forsuainifsra vath some quarts sand. Thin layers of gypsum crystals mre encountered at depths of about Iq Inches, in places where the beach was flat for some distance away from the sea margin. Similarly, a gypsum cake was found at about 12 to 16 inches from the surface in the low sandy flat a mi^e couth of j&amp;hroh g&amp;fce, Koweit. cone ntration of ©@a water takes place in such circumstances more slowly than in a olooed lagoon. But given time, and repeated wetting by &amp;m water, quite consider- able gypsum masses may be formed, in addition to direct preci pitation of the gypsum contained in sea water, it is possible that gypsum may also be formed at the expense of any 0 a Co 3 present by interaction with the sodium and magnesium sulfates also contained in sea water. Thus Mgs©4 plus C a Co3 * MgCoj plus c&amp;sq 4« This reaction is known to take place with a saturated solution of p'gso4; and under appropriate conditions, the gypsum may remain as a solid. _ — w ——w— W-™ irm I. w*. ,pi w. \ j W MS.-**W( 14 ) S&amp;adun nn&amp;y indicate that tae Koweit series extends to that point* There is certainly no topographic reason for ex pecting a change of strata in that direction, ( 30 ).

These are frequently many tono in weight 1 *. The writer found only quartzite and black foetid dolomite and daloBdfcie shale in this formation. Igneous rocks were noted, but au they were rounded boulders they were referred to the Iraq gravels. The rocks (specimens of which were brought to POhssMaerah} correspond exactly with prof, d# BockhVs des cription of the black foetid dolomite which is almost universally found overlying the salt plugs of the Persian aulf. So characteristic is this rock that professor 4m Bockh and his associates hav , on the str nr th of its occurrence alone, auoignsd the salt of K&amp;m&amp;riJ and sums of the gypsum at Ah ram to tdi@ Hormuz .series, though these are not otherwise incongruous with thn Fars beds with wnich they are in contact. If this black lot old dolomite is so sure a criterion, then there can be no doubt whatever that the whole of the pre Koweit rocks exposed at Jobel Stmwa i.e. hr.James f s Groups 1,2, &amp; 3, belong to the Hormuz Series \ '' j' -, 1 !and Um% gyp&amp;um ae-n tkara aas uj thing t j do with the yara parlod.

Tue deacriptiona of the structure and strata exposed .« this hill, especially when read limed lately after prof, de Bockh f » account jf the Harmua rocks and salt plugs, point directly to the'conclusion that the whole hill, except for Its girdle of row©it grits, and a few detrital elements belonging to the Iraq gr&amp;yels, is a tectonic breccia, tlxrust upward by a salt intrusion, and possibly further confused by collapse due to leaching away of the upie r i a rt of the 0a It lug. ( 32 ) . Iraq aravels * The Kuweit series contains many beds which are pebbly, but these pebbles are invariably &amp;&amp;&amp;!!. in no instance can it be recalled that pebbles io re than 2 inches in diameter were seen actually in the Kuweit series# On the other hand, the surface of the desert over- wide areas, especially the tops ox'* all the low ridges such as the Jal i* for, JT&amp;l Hi Ya, and the plateau surface on either side of the Batin as far as it ms traversed, is strewn with a cover of distinctly coarse pebbles and even cobbles, ranging up to d or Xu inches in diameter. (33) * The Batin in its upper part shows three distinct pebbled terrace^, of waieh the upp?er one is the general level of the country, with surface etched by wind and rain into a network of shallow hollows and low ridges. The second terrace is some 3 q or 3 (; feet lower, and is marked by only a few isolated gravai capp d hillocks, of which Tel hi obei.4 (The Little digger) is the most conspicuous.- ( 16 ) - The taird te;n,ao is some 2? feet above the Batin floor and is fslrly well preserved a 8 a chain of gravel capped ride. a.

(34). Tiiare iu thun revealed a rather lengthy history of denudation, extending back from the remote time when the Central Arabian highland lest had a climate mgi&amp;l enough to send water down the Batin, and beyond that to the time when great floods were pouring granitic debris into an enclosed sea in this region. Ceogra hical data available permit©, however, only a glimpse 0 f the events of this period. The pebbles of the Iraq gravels may b-% classified roughly in order of diminishing i'rccucney as follows - Vein cuartse, white or pink. Acid intrusive rocks «*■ ryholite, quarts porphyry porphyry, and feisits. dhyolitic agglomerat &amp;. Quartsite and quartxitic sandstone (not unlike 6 &lt;&gt;me Hu b i an a auds t no s}.

( 38 ) . the diagenetie state of thoee beds varie© so much, fro^i extreme min- raiifc&amp;tion to the opposite end of the scale, that no exact judgment can be based on this feature. Hevcrthelese, if it is correctly surmised, that most of the ca CQ^ in the aeries was deposited along Tlth the detritai elements, and not introduced oubeequently, the normal degree of consoli iation due to diai^cnesis must be rather Ion* ( 39 ) * The abnormal silicification of a restricted part of the formation is due to some special cause anti has no bearing on the question of agu. (4o). fne nature of the s edimeats points to a period when a rainy climate prevailed in Central Arabia, and when there was an enclosed sea flanking tlie Arabian continc-nt in this vicinity, it my be noted that the higher contours of the Arabian mss (looo - 3uOO feet, see Bartholomews 9 map) show &amp; very pronounced reentrant sen th west from Basruli. The effect of tills would be, given a rainy climate in the highlands, to concentrate the run off along, a line roughly bisecting the reentrant - that is, towards Koweit. (*i!‘ • 4 branch of the Faro sea would fulfil the second condition, if, as has been suggested, Ca CO 3 fsally takes the place of vlia t in notcmal Far® It rata hue been deposited as gypsum.} ( 42 ). On other hana, it is not impoeeiblt that an inianu initiated in thia region, uy rift faulting, at a much later period. The: period when thia might naturally be expected would be the late pliocene or early pleistocene, then the Dead r.ea - Jordan Rift was definitely formed and when the Hed sea trough finally sank so far that the Indian oocen and the mediterranean were joined. ( 43 ) . The latter supposition would accox’d more naturally with the first requisite, namely, a humid climate in central Arabia, it is known that the Glacial conditions which prevailed in northern lurope in pleistocene times produced a change of clinate even so far south as Sgypt and the ped sou. fH® wile then carried down gravels, which* [ have been discharged into it by wadi© which are now permanently dry. The deep gorges cut far back into the Red sea Hills can scarcely bo the work of a climate so relatively dry as the present one. There is, of course, the direct evidence of the Batin trench, and its gravels, which proves that there has been a pluvial age even in Central Arabia. But the question - © now whether the capacity of this pluvial time can be extended so as to include first a period of great sedimenta tion into a closed tceweit sea, men a breaking up. of the Koweit barrier and a rise of these goweit sediments into the sphere of erosion. ( 44 ) , as regards the length of tim«: during which pluvial conditions prevailed, there seer is to be no imp© ssi bill ty in these assumptions. The Ice Age in iurope has been found to cover a very long interval, and to comprise four mu in periods of glacial aavance, separated by retreat or interglacial period, in the very attractive tables of professor I O; pen, the oldest glacial period is plausibly dated 55 o * 6 c;O, 0 og years ago; while the youngest fulls only 7 o - 120,000 yeax^s( 19 &gt; &amp;S0 1*^ pT9SUI39d 'thGlti 6GCil gl&amp;CiQ'X p'-»_0 : iia.. Si biTRiXtiX* effect in pressing southward the limit oi the vjet belt. I { 45 ). With regard to the Batin and its gravels, the suggestion may ha made that perhaps the climate of Arabia is not so arid on the average as present dry conditions indicate. It may be that once in a while - perhaps once in several hundreds, or even thousands of years - a deluge such as Noah experienced may take 7 place. ®he Batin terraces may be steps cut by successive single deluges at long intervals. One knows (to quote analogy in lieu r of evidence - of which there is not enough) that the arid northern region of Peru is affected by a real rainfall only once in about • 3 j years. But this occasional rain is such as to effect tremend- J ous changes in the landscape, excavating gorges and piling up debris which appear inexplicable in the intorveniiig rainless i years. 1'he well known tanks at Aden were evidently built with a knowledge of a considerable potential rainfal such as Aden has never known. But it may be that, at long intervals, an adequate fall of rain does take place. ( 46 ). Sufficient evidence is not available to settle the age of the Kowoit series. Speculative support can be found ^.or any age from Miocene to Pleistocene, i’he writer would prefer, on the whole, to accept the latter, but cannot pretend to decide on first hand evidence. IV. C 0 li C L U S ION. 'The Koweit Series extends inland, northwestwards and probably southwards far beyond the limits which it was permitted to explore. The nature of the series, the conditions of its deposi tion, and its age are considered. Speculative answers are put forward to some of the questions raised. a pleistocene age is preferred, though certainty is not attainable on first hand - nor indeed on any evidence.isALL COMMUNICATIONS TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY. .X ^ 0,1 co «^ LONDON, GLASGOW AND MOHAMMERAH. ^ Telegraphic Address ANGLOPER3.

Major Holmes* London principals have been bother ing us for the last few months trying to sell us the Koweit concession before they have got itl and all the other con cessions too. They say that they have no intention of work ing themselves. All they wish to do is to sell to someone else, but we are not having any. The refusal of the Colonial Office to agree to freedom of Customs duty on imported ma terials for the period of the concession makes it difficult for us to go in for it, as to do so would be to prejudice our position in Persia and that of our friends the Turkish Petro leum Company in Mesopotamia where, in both cases, freedom of Customs duty has been provided for in the concession: but we shall go on trying and sooner or later when the Colonial Of fice and others finally realise that the E.G-.S. have - as they have admitted to me - no intention of working the thing them selves, the Colonial Office may agree to our taking on the job and really trying to find oil. May we expect you home this year? If so, I shall be glad to see you both. I hope your wife is well again. With very kind regards, Yours sincerely. Major J.C.

You ui?y remeaber that #hea you -vere returning ShaiJch Ahaad* s call on your recent visit here, the subject of drilling for water came up in conversation. I mentioned that Mr. Armstrong had told me that very day that he had reached a certain depth, and the Shaikh was surprised at what I said, as he had been told a diffsrent depth. You will have seen from my last Diary that ’’drilling operations have had to be stop ed temporarily,pending uha receipt of a further supply of piping from England'. Major Holmes came here last Just before I went on leave, and I was surprised when I got back to find that, although drilling operations had been in Progress since the iirst fortnight in May, there was nothing on my files on the subject subsequent to the Agreement signed bn Oth April 19 ^ 6 , of which I sent an advance copy to the Resi dency with my memorandum No.39H of 8th March 1916,although this Agreement required a slight modification in view of^ Clause vl). I understand, however, that this is what is supposed to be being worked on. 8y it the Syndicate has to sink a well - or rather two wells - to a depth of 7o0 feet, unless sweet water is found at a lesser depth, and to go beyond that depth if required but only on receiving an extra Rs.90/- a' foot for any depth over TOO feet. The Shaikh has given up all hope of water now, and certainly vould not pay extra for boring beyond 700 feet. „ According to Mr. Armstrong, they have now drilled •?,bout &gt; 0 feet“ I learn from another source however that he has already used up at least ^50 feet of piping, and probably more. I asked him how much he was expecting out from Home now, and he said about 700 feet. I asked him what he wanted so much for as he had already done 500 ,and according to the Agreement o ily had to do ? r 0 - There is n » W ii 10 t 5 ik 0f a ? econd wel1 -• He replied that this was a smaller bore of piping, which he would put down inside the the existing piping right to the top, and then he hoped to DHj - 1 u ? ^He^exl^s t log pi pi ng,. I pretended to believe this, out I most certainly do not. The don hxe iiteut. Colonel L. B. H. Haworth, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 3ushire.kr. Armstrong also said that the Syndicate would not haggle over digging an extra hundred feet or so, if they thought the chances of getting water were &amp; ood, as It would only take a day or two to do so. Yet I gathered from what Jacks of the A * F * 0•G• told me at the time the Agreement was made, that it could not pay anyone to sink wells at the price at which the Eastern and General Syndicate has under- taken to do it here. I did not think anything of that asl assumed ^lajor Holmea' a object was to ^.et a footing in Kuwait In the hopes of ultimately t.etUrifc an oil concession, . v Has the possibility ever struct you that the drillint in Auwait may really be for oil , and not for water et all.

The Concession terms and conditions to be on the same lines as the Bahrein oil Concession granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, on December 2nd 1925 by the Sheiich of Bahrein. The Concession Agreement has to be sanctioned by the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf before it becomes valid. Office Col.Prideaux suggested that it was not an opportune moment to approach the Sheikh of Koweit and suggested that it would be better to delay approaching the Shaikh for a tim*« Syndicate, Limited, as its representative to approach the Sheikh of Koweit to see if he be willing to discuss and grant an Oil Concession covering his Territory* this letter to the Hon’ble the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf with the request that the political Agent in Kuwait be instructed to inform the Sheikh of Koweit in writing that The Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, have permission from the Colonial Office to negotiate with him if he be willing to do so an oil Concession for Koweit Territory• When the permission was given by the Colonial I am n&amp;w instructed by The Eastern and General I would therefore be glad if you will forward 1 shall be much obliged if the ilon , ble the Political^esident of the Persian Gulf would advise the T» Political Agent at Koweit to inform the Sheikh as above2 above requested as soon as possible so that l may call, see and sound the Sheikh of Koweit as to his wishes in the matter on my way home to England towards the end of the present month. 1 am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Referenoe your telegram No.361 dated the £ 26th Ma^r 1928 . The Shaikh has shown rae a draft Agreement for an Oil Gonoessicn, which Major Holm-fs haa submitted to him. 1 gather that he has only been persuaded to consider i at all by the promise of a Lincoln motor car, and I do not think there is much liklihood of his granting the concession as he told me that he considered the Eastern &amp; General Syn dicate a very 'weak' concern. He added that in any case he would have several other conditions of his own to lay down which they might well not accept. The failure of the water drilling operations,although they still say that they hope to get water any day, has un doubtedly detracted from the prestige of the Syndicate in Kuwait. In fact a good many people in Kuwait think that the were never trying for ahhwataaii water, but were secretly trying for oil Instead. I of course do not know what the Shaikh thinks about this, but he certainly must have heard the suggestion* The actual draft Oil Concession is based on the BahraJi Oil Concession, but is very much more generous to the Shaik I enclose herewith a note showing such differences as exist between it and the Bahrain Oil Concession. If the Shaikh should wish to grant the Concession, I can see no grounds on which we should object - except in so far as the last clause of Article IX is concerned. Thi$ clause reads that ’’All imported native xabour will be sub ject to and obey the Laws of the State of Kuwait .1 presume this wasthis was inserted as the result of prerlous negotiations,- but, as imported native labour would probably be largely Indian, It could not hold, and In any case Is quite outside the sphere of a oommerolal Agreement.

Major Holmes did not apparently mention the word ”011' to the Shaikh during this visit. Lieut.-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait1 CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch Mo. 5, dated the 5th February 1929, 1 have the honour to report that Major F. Holmes arrived in Kuwait on the 6 th February and left on the 16th for Baghdad, whence it is understood he left for the United Kingdom on the 23rd February. The Political Agent at Kuwait reports that during this visit Ma^or Holmes apparently did not renew with the Shaikh the negotiations for an oil concession. The following develop ments resulting from an agreement for the sinking of artesian wells in Kuwait are, however, not without interest in connection with the oil con cession . In March 1926 the Eastern and General Syndicate undertood to sink within the area surrounded by the town wall of Kuwait two wells to a depth of '’OO feet, unless sweet water was obtained at a lesser depth, in consideration of T&gt; s . 100,000 of which Hs. 40,000 was to be paid in advance, Hs. 30,000 on completion of the first well HIS MATES'^SECRETARY OF 3^ATE fohJthe colonies; COLONIAL OFFICE, DOWNING STREET, Ho- s? /S'S'' LONDON•well and the balance on completion of the second well. After several failures the first well recently reached the depth of 700 feet without striking sweet water and Majof Holmes haa apparent j.y advised the Shaikh that owing to the nature of the rock which has been reached it is to the Shaikh’s interest to abandon the bore and not to exeica.se his option of drilling deeper at his own expense. The Shaikh has paid under the contract only .lie initial sum of Hs. 40,000 and it would appear that on being approached by Major Holmes for payment of the sum of the Rs. 30,000 due on completion of Hie first well the Shaikh has now demurred on the ground that'the Syndicate have failed to fulfill their undertaking to find water. The curious feature is that, despite the fact that under the agreement this payment is noo conditional on success, and that any point in dispute is to be referred to the Political Agent xor arbitration, Major Holmes has apparent ly only agreed, subject to the Sundicate’s concurrence, to waive this and all other claims against the Shaikh under the agreement, but has also offered to drill another well elsewhere entirely at the Syndicate’s expense and to rely on t$e Shaikh’s generosity in the event of finding good water. Lieutenant-Colonel More reports that Major Holmes is most mysterious as to the nature of the rock reached at the depth of 700 feet and has told him that he would greatly like Mr Mayo, the Chief Geologist of the Anflo-Persian Oil Company3 . *■ 4 4? Company, to examine it and that he has written to the latter ahoHit it. Major holmes has also instructed Mr Armstrong, the Syndicate’s driller at Kuwait, to send him in England hy atr mail a sample of the rock. The facts suggest the possibility that Major Holmes believes that he has reached an oil bearing formation and that it is wotth the Syndicate’s while to drill elsewhere in KUwait in order to carry out further investigations.

From Lieutenant-Colonel H.B.P.Bides on, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. To T&amp;e Hon’ble the Political Resident in t&amp;e Persian Gulf, Bushire. ^mTor holmbd T oil Sir, In reply to your telegram No.818 dated 9 th September, and in continuation of my confidential despatch Ho.294 dated End September and paragraph 9, I have the honour to forward in the form of an attached statement certain corrections and additions which I think with ad- A- •vantage be incorporated in Major Holmes* draft oil conces sion ; which he proposes negotiating with His Excellency the Shaikh of Suwait. 2 . I would also suggest that before any final agreement is signed, Major Holmes* draft together with my suggestions be examined by a person possessing legal know ledge with a view to insuring that non© of its articles run contrary to the provisions of the Kuwait Order in Council of 1925. 5 . I would also venture to suggest, if you see no objection to such course, that similar action be taken with Air Headquarters, Baghdad, with a view to safeguarding all possible present and future requirements of the Royal Air Force. 4. In particular, I would lay stress on para graph ( 5 ) above as in my humble opinion the principality of Kuwait with its excellent climate and land-looked harbour, is bound to become a point of great strategic Importance to the Empire as time goes on, and especially after 1932, when♦Iraq will obtain lier independence, I even go so tax as to assert that in Kuwait, we possess what is destined to bee one our leading Haval and Air Base in the Gulf. For it is evident that a force established at Kuwait will be able to dominate the Gulf 9 protect our Eastern air route (both that portion which passes down the Euphrates and also the portion down the Arabian shore), and last but not least, will give us a secure ff pi@d a terr© n from which to threaten Basrah, the Euphrates valley and hejd. S* Ihe Kuwait 'wedge* penetrating deeply as it does into, and dividing the boundaries of Hejd and ’Iraq where they meet near the Persian Gulf, will further give a** us all important dominating advantage over He jd and f Iraq / and put us in the position of betag able to strike at the flank of either State should they ever be at war with each other, and it is to our advantage to come to the assistance of one or the other. 6 . i’o my mind the advantages of creating the future Gibraltar of the Gulf at Kuwait, are so obvious that I think a form of military occupation of the Prin cipality is not an improbability in course of time, which if tactfully arranged with the BuXer by means of suitable treaty, to include such things as generous subsidy, the guaranteeing of all his frontiers, tine placing of any military force in can to meats well away from the town area, and complete assurance of non-interference in internal matters, will be welcomed rather than resented, provided always the matter is approached with tact and diplomacy. 7 . This brings me to paragraph 1 of major Holmes’ agreement and the safeguarding clauses which I think should be inserted. The Shuwaikh area and coaling station as recently leased by us from the Kuler, and given up when we occupied ’Iraq and thought we were going to stay there, is of great value because it xjossesses a good deep water aiid anchorage, a few hundred feet from til© mainland,v 3- -o- / 0 whioii anclxoragB is oaapietely protected from the stron G est 'Bhamals' or Worth West wind by the island of Grain. With this area safeguarded for the future * se of the Royal Havy and Royal Air Force, we retain the principal asset for a future Air and Naval Base in our hands from the .tart,and ,*° any 011 or otller that may come along. Similarly-, if no t secured beforehand, it will be the first spot to be seized upon by a commercial concern. ** similarly the only suitable site for future cantonments having regard to the intense summer heat of Kuwait, is the land lying along the Northern diore of the naa alT.'-rdh peninsula, starting froa al- 3 haab to the Ras al-virdh point. In this area the summer temperature is always 7° to 10° cooler than anywhere further inland, be cause both North Western and South Eastern winds which prevail blow across water# It is necessary therefore in my opinion to deny this area and to a depth of 1 mile, to Major Holmes’ company who will be the first to build barracks etc* etc. for their staff on the site* I s or similar reasons, I have also included the aerodrome, and camping grounds of al-Basm&amp;h and al- Nigars, 1 and 2 miles respectively South East of Kuwait and on the road to the reserved area mentioned in ( 8 )# 10 * I do not propose to discuss other proposed additions and alterations in the agreement of Major Holmes suggested in the attached statement, as each bears an obviously important meaning, and speaks for itself. Para graph 8 and subheads (a) and (b) must of course come out and the 'British Nationality' clause as laid down by the Colonial Office must replace it. This to me is an obvious and ne cessary precaution and one which the Shaikh himself desires. 11. Lastly if Major Holmes 1 company agrees to the 'British Nationality' clause being inserted in the Agreemait, the next step will be to decide on the best way of getting-4- 3*0^ tbe other various clauses suggested by me^put in, always of course provided th^r are approved. In ray opinion and ©specially as the uhaikh has not as yet seen the proposed agreement, it would be simplest and quickest if His Majesty 1i Government were to Instruct Major Holmes to make the correctr ions required, before he returns to the charge, and opens discussions with the Shaikh* This can be don© either in London or by letter from you to me. The other way, but not so good, is to wait for Major Holmes to start negotiations and then when the Shaikh asks our advice, to require him to get Major Holmes to insert our clauses.

The two copies were handed to the Political Agent Kuwait on the 29th August 1930, with a request that one copy he sent to the Political Resident Bushire. This I did so that the Political Resident and the Political Agent Kuwait could forward their views on the subject to the Colonial Office and so save time in the forthcoming negotia tions with them here. Yours faithfully, Sd/- Frank Holmes. The Secretary Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, 19, St. Swithin’s Lane, E. 0. 4*Confidential lA 2 - ' ^ D.O. No.8 of 12.1.31. Th© Agency, Kuwait. I have recently been prowling round the state and trying to find out what has made Holmes so keen on getting an oil concession from the Bheikh of Kuwait. 2. As I think the results of my investigations will interest you I give them below. 3 •Also they will be useful for you as weapons should you meet Holmes in Baghdad, where I hear he is at the present moment• ^••Briefly, and as already mentioned in my Intelligence Report No.333 Dated 27th December, I found a most inter esting spring of pure Bitumen or tar, oozing out of the ground in the crater like depression formed by the ”Burgan ' hills 40 miles south of Kuwait. Though the aera is now heavily covered with a deposit of sand, I believe if properly examined the whole place would divulge a series of Bitumen springs which I presume is a bl-product of oil. The stuff was oozing out in a soft glutinuous state, and I brought back samples. Actually these springs have been reported in Knox’s time I believe, but the report may have quite easily been overlooked. Holmes certainly visited Burgan Hills and examined the springs. 3. At Wara, the curious sugar loaf shaped hill, 10 miles north of Burgan, I found a piece of stone covered with Bitumen deposit. I brought back a sample. No deposit of this mineral has ever been reported as far as I know to u exist at this place. Holmes also visited 'Wara'^ Hill and examined it. 6.On the 9th I visited and examined the area due north of Kuwait Town on the opposite side of the bay. Near '^Mughatti where th® whole country side is a mass of red sandstone, I found in the low lying salty depression known as the The Honbl®• Lt.Col. H.V.Biscoe 0/0 H.E. Th© High Commissioner for Iraq,the 3ahra M , two obviously fairly recently excavated holes in the ground out of which crude oil was slowly oozing and trying to mix with the salty puddles that lay about after the recent rains. It was quite obvious what the stuff was from its strong smell. My bedouin escort told m® that in Hamlltons tim® a Euro pean had paid the place a visit from Basra, but to his disappointment had almost immediately been recalled. They said Holmes did not see the place, tut I happen to know that in Holmes* absence in England his mining Engineer Armstrong did do so on the quiet. My informant also tells me that he reported very favourably on what he found to London. It Is significant that the so called ’’water bore” which Armstrong put down near the Sheiks Palace, and which went down 700 feet and more, lay exactly on the straight line drawn between the oil spring mentioned in ( 6 ) above and the ’’Burgan” hill to the south: Also samples of some kind of black deposit of the consistency of putty, and strongly Impregnated with crude oil were brought up to the surface. I got this from a person who saw it, and I know the sample was never shown to the Sheikh. According to Armstrong who openly told me this in private conversation, there are traces of oil also in the form of surface ooze 5 miles east of Jahara on the sea shore( south side of Bay) • These I have not yet visited. Armstrong also gave s. fri.end of mine to understand that he thought the oil bearing Zone moved in a S.Westerly direction from A.P.O.G’s main fields at Maidan Naphtun, and that the most llkel y_glace to find it in Kuwait^territory was towards the A out All the above facts I give for what they are worth, as you may think it worth while passing my letter on to the A.P.O.C or to It Is quite patent to me that there are strong ’surface” oil Indications in Kuwait, but whether the ’strata” lies the right way is another matter: Holmes quite obviously thinks it does, or he would not be so anxious to get his agreement through.

Downing Street, 18th February 1931. Dear Colonel Biscoe, Please refer to our despatch ConfidentiaI'A H of the 6th of February, and previous correspondence about the application of the Eastern and General Syndicate,Limited, for an oil concession in Kuwait. I think you should know that, with a view to ascertain ing whether there are any prospects of British interests being willing to undertake exploration for oil in the Kuwait area,, Sir John Cadman has been asked, through the Mines Department here, whether either the Anglo-Persian Gil^ Company or the Iraq Petroleum Company would be prepared to consider the matter. A reply has now been received from him to the effect that the available geological information does not encourage the Anglo-Persian Gil Company to take t any further steps in the matter. The Company point out that they endeavoured in 1921 to obtain a concession without success, and the present condition oi the oil market and the discovery of further large resources of oil in Iraq, have not tended to strengthen their case xor expending any more capital on oil exploration in Kuwait. Moreover the country of Kuwait appears to be entirely covered with alluvium and rocks of recent geological age, which would involve drilling of a very speculative type. I should add that, before replying definitely on the point Sir John Cadman expressed a wish to know the character of the terms which the Eastern and 'j-eneral Syndicate ... r k *7 ^ '•V£&gt;- 2 - Syndicate were prepared to offer in Kuwait, and also the terms on which the concession in Bahrain was actually concluded, -^o objection was felt to supplying Sir John with a copy of the Bahrain Concession, which is a fait accompli, and this was done. As the Syndicate’s application was at that time still under consideration, Sir John Cadman and the groups which he represents had to be regarded as commercial competitors, and it was thought inadvisable to disclose to one competitor the terms which had been offered by another. He was, therefore, told no more than that the proposed Kuwait Concession was Qifygenerally similar lines to the concession already granted in Bahrain, with variations as to payment. I did not want to put this into a despatch and hence have resorted to a semi-official letter.

On final arrival at Kuwait ho called on me and told m Mm ho had only come to close down his so called watts:* boring plant and pay tho Shaikh compensation of Es 10,000/- for not finding water.

I Ixive also good reason to believe that results have bo^i highly sa-. tory from his point of view. 0* On the lot May the Shaikh told me that Holaos had given him 'notes' for i. 10,000/*- trid had asked permission to remove the 'water' boring plant, which mis to be sent to Bahrain, fh© Shaikh highly praised f olmes 'generosity' which he said was most unexpected* 7* The mchinory was them dismantled., but under the exouse that existing pipes could not be withdrawn only 10 tubes out of a pipe depth of 750 feet (a prccc.) were removed. The rest have been left in situ, and the whole thing has bean covered over with oarth. Tho boring machine nai awaits shipment to Bahrain. ( fidenttally that holmes Ivjd called and given him two draft and discuss natters itk me or at least send me a copy of the agreemsat, X waited patiently till the 15th May without results# I then visited the BhsLlch and asked if h© could let me see th© copies sent to him. This was readily don© and they were sent round to me* Vhe Xhaikh at this interview assured me that Molr.nes had in no way discussed the drafts with him, nor mentioned anyt inn at all about the. 'British nationality Clause' which both he (the Bhai:ch} and we ha 6. requir ad to be included. Xo. At this and a subsequent interview th© Shaikh made it quite clear tc- me that he would look at no agreement unless it contained the •’British i*atiosmllty Clause', in accordance with his wish expressed to you and me#n • Having road bath Holmes draft agreements sent me by the shaikh, X found that the first was exactly a facsimile of the one ho had put in to the shaikh last ysa year, and which he had been told was not acceptable. The second was an entirely new one, IS. the l . , I wrote to Holmes (copy attached) and asked his to send m a copy of the draft which I understood lie had give?!, to the khal’di and on the same day he forwarded me a copy of tine second end new agreement only. He followed up his covering note by call ing and apologising for not having sent it before, and talked Wory big about what the Colonial Office had said e» to him, and ho to the Colonial Office. 1 for my part adopted a guarded attitude and refused to be drawn. 13 # After his departure 1 examinee the new agreement, and found that it contained no clause what soever that complied with tie Nationality Clause^ w© stood, out for, instead clause 8 had been inserted which as you will see for yourself in no way meets the case, and. to my mind is even more objections.ol© than t.sut in serted in the 1930 draft agreement. 1 also found certain differences betweem the -ruble and knoll eh texts rhich I have smrlced. I rattiest* suspect that Holmes hopes to push his present draft through by judicious palm*oiling of cor tain high dignataries here after I am gone. I do not of course believe the baikh will succumb to such an attack - X have far too mch confidence on Ms sense. 1 r J# I enclose with tids the copy of the draft agre&amp;rnant in question, with a request that should you desire to give me any special instructions in the snattei , these.' might be sent me by telegram. 16&lt; I shall of course explain to Gr nway beforo X go hor? the local 'oil” situation stands, but beyond this and advising him t o be on his guard I do not mycolf counsel any particular action at present.17.

Before he left he come and saw me, and in a long rather defiant talk gave oo to understand, that he did give the Bhaildi the last year's draft agreement as well as the new one (sent Biscoe by me) deliberately, as he wanted the Shaikh to decide which of the two he liked best. 5. He said he was aware that last years draft had been turned down by His Majesty's Government for having no nationality clause and the new one woo like unto it hut that did not worry him, and he was determined to return to Kuwait in about 15 days to see what he could do as regards a special 'Nationality” clause of his own that would suit the shaikh's 'qualms' {hie words). 4 . He added that he had bean told by the authorities at Home (I’ve no doubt a lie) that he could acyxXn go and try his luchT with the Shaikh even though His Majesty* a Government had thrown out his is SO agreement* By this I suppose he meant that he intended to persuade the shaikh to waive hie objection to a 'Bril^h' clause by hook or by crook.
