A Certificate of Identity has been issued to ABDULLA bin FARAJ in order to enabL him to proceed to Basra. In regard to i/iURAD bin DOST MUHAMiV.AD. This inaiviaual states he is from Mekran and is a Persian subject,hence a Certificate of Identity cannot be issued to him. In the circumstances it would perhaps be preferable if you would issue him a Permit to enable him to land at the first Persian port if his repatriation to Charbar is I too expensive,since,he being a bad character, it would be undesirable to sena him to Basra.
