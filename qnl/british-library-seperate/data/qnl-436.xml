The hostilities were initially due to the dispute on the sovereignty over Al Udaid [’Odaid, Qatar] considered to be Abu Dhabi property, and provoked attacks and raids. The main events dealt with in the volume are the attack of Bedouin from Abu Dhabi on Al Bida [Qatar] during which twenty-four men were killed including Ali, Shaikh Jasim's son, and the subsequent Qatari attack to Dhafrah [Abu Dhabi].The volume also contains copious letters in Arabic (with English translations) sent to the Political Resident in Persian Gulf at Bushire by local rulers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Muḥammad bin 'Abdullah Āl Rashīd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Bidda</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Odaid</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a2#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
