Under the terms of the agreement, signed on 22 July 1937, the Ruler of Dubai was to receive 440 rupees per month for 'pay of guards' for the seaplane base; a new five-year agreement was signed on 6 June 1938, by which the payment ('rent' for the base, including 'pay of guards etc') was increased to 940 rupees per month. The records cover payments for the period July 1937 - January 1945 inclusive. Payments were made through the Residency Agent, Sharjah; original receipts were to be forwarded to the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The papers include: covering letters for the payments, sent by the office of the Political Agent, Bahrain to the Residency Agent, Sharjah, and (from 1943) the Political Officer, Trucial Coast (POTC), Sharjah; letters in Arabic (with translations into English) from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, and (from 1943) the Political Officer, Trucial Coast (POTC), Sharjah, confirming payment to the Ruler of Dubai; copies of receipts in Arabic (with English translations) issued by the Ruler of Dubai; and some related correspondence between the office of the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.There is also an apparently-misfiled group of papers following the same format, recording a payment to the Regent of Kalba (Khalid bin Ahmed [Shaikh Khālid bin Aḥmad bin Sulṭān Āl Qasimī]) for the period January-February 1941, dated March 1941 (ff 167-169).The title is taken from the front cover; there is also a similarly-worded title page within the volume, on folio 10, but with file reference 4/25.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00030e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00030e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
