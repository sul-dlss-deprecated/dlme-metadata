From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. There is nothing to report. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. The British and Bussian Ministers had an audience of the Shah this afternoon at which a general understanding was reached for cordial and inti mate relations between the three Powers based on a policy of benevolent neutrality on the part of Persia towards her two neighbours. The Cabinet is to be strengthened by the inclusion of tw T o Persian Statesmen Prince Ain- ed-Dowleh and Prince Farman Farma who are known to favour the streng thening of the friendly relations between the three Powers. Tehran is perfectly quiet and very pleased with the news. His Imperial Majesty the Shah is at the Palace and the report that he has left or intends to leave the Capital is without foundation. 64 Telegram P., No. 457-F., dated the 15th (received 16th) November 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Great alarm has been caused here by arrival of Bussian troops at Karej, twenty miles from Tehran, and advance of a few outposts beyond that point. Shah made preparations to depart to Bum from the capital. Bussian Minister and I were invited to Palace where Prime Minister, President of the Council and other (s) Minister (s) (were ?). We came (to) following agreement: — Troops will not advance beyond Harej and Cabinet will meanwhile be strengthened by inclusion Farman Farma and Ain-ed-Dowleh whose presence and responsibility will be a guarantee to us of a policy of benevolent neutrality towards the two Powers. As soon (as) our conversation has begun (with) new Cabinet for the pur pose (of) agreeing as to measures required for giving practical effect to this policy troops will be withdrawn from Karej to Yengi Imam, viz., about half way (to) Kasvin and eventually to Kasvin. I earnestly (trust ?) that this arrange ment will meet with approval. -ived on 20 J i w i t) v.'.ui INDIA FOREIGN SSCRETABY’S Letts?.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Clear the line. My telegram No. 457. Yesterday three enemy missions left Tehran, Germans being first to go. Their departure shows how ( [ lffi dent they are of their hold in Persia. Advance of Russian troops on the other hand has terrified Shah and a mere rumour they are coming nearer might cause Shah to tollow Germans It is of prime importance therefore that Russian Minister and 1 should be allowed control for next fortnight or so over movement of troops towards or from Tehran. For the moment the danger point is an inexperi enced and nervous youth who requires constant management. As for Government as distinct from Shah it seems as if Germans boast that a Turco-German (force ?) will appear in Persia has made considerable impression upon them. I do not know what importance should be attached to this, boast, but Germans and Turks might succeed in getting together on frontier some force of tribesmen with a few regulars, and I think it w r ould be useful if w’e were authorised to assure Persian Government that in order to repel any aggression in that quarter two powers would give their support to Persia. A defensive alliance would possibly he best solution : it would he commit tal of Persia to us and would regularise use in Persia of Russian troops. It is impossible to predict what effect in Provinces events of yesterday will have German Agents working there are far more resolved and reckless than was German Legation (has proved ?) and they will very likely (now try to ?) raise revolution in the country. If, on the other hand, in the next few days we can definitely commit Per sian Government to our side I think it is probable majority of their partisans will abandon Germans.

Yesterday Russian Minister and I were invited to Palace for consultation as to formation of Cabinet. The attitude of Ain-ed-Dowleh was most unsatis factory, partly from jealousy of Farman Farma and partly from fear of responsibility and he refused to accept any ministerial post in the Cabinet.

Shah received to-dav the Russian Minister and was much less insistent on withdrawal from Karei of troops. It would be most expeditious nevertheless in order to appease public opinion and to (re-assure ?) Shah that a commencement of withdrawal should be made. A moderate detachment should, however, remain since Germans, Mujahidin, Austrians, etc., would return, if troops were withdrawn completely before Farman Farma has situation in hand and we should revert to situation that prevailed before their arrival in the vicinity.

It seems from various telegraph departmental communications which I have seen that Director of Persian Section, Tehran, Superintendent, Kerman, anticipate Central Persian line, may be permanently put out of use at any moment. If so, all the State traffic from Tehran will have to come through Kobat, Sistan and Meshed. There is only one Indian telegraph clerk at Eobat. At Sistan the two English clerks are not paid by Telegraph Department but by this Consulate for^which in addition to telegraphing they have always been doing all my clerical confidential work. When Eobat-Sistan line was constructed I practically lost altogether services of one clerk. If Central Persian line breaks down I shall lose entire services of both clerks and without assistance they will be unable to cope with the work for many days. Similarly there appears urgent need for reinforcing Eobat. I understand that Persian section is under-manned. It seems desirable if Indo-European Telegraph Department clerks cannot be sent from Karachi that military signallers or Indiars should be sent to both Eobat and Sistan. As the Persian Government presumably will maintain their title to day hours, most of working hours will piobably be at night. As there is only one clerk at Meshed now it appears that staff there should also be increased. 87 Telegram P., No. 296-C., dated (and received) the 19th November 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan, Robat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Mr. Medcalf, who has joined my office, was relieved of his duties by Mr. Dormer, lately Telegraph Clerk in Sistan Consulate Inspectorship of seventh sub-section (i.e., from Sistan to Bam). The Officer Commanding, Sistan Column, has expressed a wish to have Mr. Dormer brought on to the Indian Army Eeserve of Officers and attachecl to his Porce. I enquired from the Director, Persian Section, through Hit; Majesty’s Minister at Tehran if Mr. Dormer’s services could be spared. A reply has been received from the Director to the effect that, provided no relief is asked for and that Lovell or Medcalf is permitted to take over Inspectorship of seventh sub-section, he has no objection. To Medcalf resuming charge in addition to duties in Sistan I have no objection and I would like to gratify wishes of Mr Dormer and the OfficerCommanding, but on the understanding that Mr. Medcalf is not required to tour along the telegraph line until the telegraph staff at Sistan is reinforced by at least two more men if possible. In this connection please refer to my telegram No. 295-C. of to-day. The Army Department |would not I presume in the special circumstances of the case require Mr. Dormer to undergo one month’s training in India with British Regiment.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, To—The Deputy Director General, Telegraphs, Traffic, Calcutta. Central Persian telegraph line is apparently interrupted and is likely to remain so for some time. Consequently heavy traffic will be inevitable on line via Robat, Sistan and Meshed and staffs will require reinforcement. Could you send at once ten or twelve additional signallers to Quetta to proceed as soon as escorts are available to Persia. They should report for orders to General Officer Commanding, Quetta.

The Persian Government has intimated to the Russian Minister and me that they are ready to enter into an alliance against Turkey, with us. I have no accurate details yet but I understand, among other things, they will require promise to defend Persia from possible Turkish attack by which (it ?) may be understood that a promise of hundred thousand rifles and two hundred guns, latter to be under orders, British and Russian officers will be required. Six points mentioned in my telegram No. 442 will also be brought forward for later discussion and possibly they may ask for some formal shares in possession of Holy places in Mesopotamia, administration being left entirely in our hands.8 ■hhhmhhmmhmm^ I am assured that no to By a friend in whom I can place implicit reliance outrageous demand will be made.

As yet I have taken no steps with Persian Government as I have not requisite information as to the situation at Shiraz to know how they can deal with it. Government here would be powerless, if report of Kawam’s assassination and of Soulet’s defection proved correct. Any attempt to put pressure on them would make situation here, which is difficult, worse than it is now. Turkish Ambassador is at Shah Abdul Azim, German Minister is at Kum, Austrian Minister is at Kerizek. An attempt to seize any of them by means of Russian troops would be signal for Shah’s departure. This would mean virtual rupture of relations with the two Powers. 97 Telegram P., No. 268, dated (and received) the 21st November 1915.

From—The Deputy Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. My last telegram. It appears from a letter from O’Connor that about 9 am. November 10th an anonymous self-constituted “National Committee for the protection of Independence of Persia ” delivered to O’Connor ultimatum giving him thirty minutes to submit to the “ Provisional arrest of himself and the British Colony and their despatch to Borasjun to be there detained for exchange with German and Persian prisoners taken on Persian neutral territory by his compatriots. As for women they can, if they wish remain in perfect security at Shiraz or accompany you to Barasjun whence they will be sent under escort to Bushire immediately.” Failing acceptance within thirty minutes houses of British would be bombarded. Assistant Superintendent Smith would be held liable personally if the telegraph installation was not handed over intact. After arrival of British Colony in Borasjun as stated the men were handed over to Tangistani Khans and in whose charge the prisoners are is not quite clear. Mrs. Ferguson says Sheikh Husain but I have not received any letter from him or anyone else. In his letter O’Connor states that following are Khan’s conditions for the release of prisoners :— I. Return of all German and Persian prisoners taken on Persian soil with their belongings. II. Repayment of certain sums attached during occupation belonging to Ghazanfar and Sheikh Husain. * III, Evacuation of Bushire, that is, the withdrawal of our troops from there. As^ regards No. II subject was referred to in my telegram No. 482-C., Ghazanfar’s money is intact here; about one quarter of Sheikh Husain’s money was used to reimburse out-of-pocket loss caused to British subjects by raids which his son led. The balance is here still. As it does not appear in the ultimatum this condition has been apparently interpolated by the Khans. I presume that these terms will be quite unacceptable. Mrs. Furguson states, that to intensify the force of ultimatum Husain sent a message by her demanding a reply by Wednesday, November 21th, or “ he would declare war on10 f mittee.” Repeated to Foreign, Sir P. Cox ; addressed to Tehran. 102 Telegram P., No. 712-C., dated the 21st (received 22nd) November 1915. jr roni The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Please see my telegram No. 70S-C. Darya Begi says telegrams to Kawam, Soulet and Khans would carry more weight if they were signed by Ain-ud-Daula instead of or in addition to Firman Firma. Possibly Shah himself might be induced to send some telegrams. The “ National Committee ” referred to in my telegram No. 710-C., appears to be composed of Persian officers of gendarmerie assisted by German Consul. I venture to suggest for consideration, since the whole business was engineered by gendarmerie, whether it would not be advisable that His Imperial Majesty the Shah should issue Rescripts ordering return to Shiraz of prisoners and their reinstatement with all honour in their original places or their surren der to us here, failing which Fars regiment of gendarmerie would be disbanded forthwith. This would not, I imagine, induce gendarmerie to hand over prison ers, or affect their own prospect much as anyhow they will not get much pay. But I think it might make an impression on the people who are inclined to be friendly or really neutral as it would deprive gendarmerie of their official status and show clearly that by Persian Government their actions are disavowed and generally discredit them. In any case I think such orders would not do any harm speaking from local point of view as the Fars regiment has evidently thrown in its lot with the rebels, and if disbanded would lose strength as even if the Committee retained their services many of the regiments of Native Cavalry would pro bably drift back to their homes.

At present moment both Persian Government and Shah are genuinely alarmed at situation to w hich their German intrigues have brought country and they feel that Persia must adopt an attitude which is more definite neu trality, even the benevolent neutrality they profess themselves ready to practise, will always leave the door open to complaints from one party or other and they woyld like to put end to all ambiguity and to declare that Persia commits(herself)to one side or other definitely, Government and Shah prefer to go to country)anif questions of alliance were raised I think that they w T ould vote iovlen tente) Of course, for their alliance they w r ould demand more than six points reported in my telegram No. 442 and first of all they will require assurances of protection against Turkish aggression. His Majesty’s Government aie of course much better able than myself to gauge consequences to ourselves if Persia entered into war against us, but I feel that they far outweigh any disadvantages, present (or^future, attendant on conclusion of a Persian alliance. If Persia willingly or otherwise joins Germany, German aims of immobiliz ing force in India that are required elsewhere, of making insecure our military position in Mesopotamia and of stirring trouble in Caucasus may well be realized. If Persia, on the other hand, becomes our ally German plans here fail assuredly. In the event of Persia joining them they are promising Persia that in two or three months a Turco-German army corps will be sent from Constantinople. I do not suppose that they ever intend to do more than send a small force as nucleus of an army for use against us in Mesopotamia and Afghanistan, recruited, formed and organized under German and Turkish officers. This scheme would be certainly abandoned if no response could be expected in this country. Moreover, propaganda here would soon collapse with Persian Government openly hostile to Germans; they would keep certain number of small tribes with them, but all the greater ones would stand by Persian Government. Prom military point of view our responsibilities would therefore not be great. Persian demands as price of her alliance may be grouped under two heads—financial and political. She will w^ant money in some form but certainly nothing at all commensurate with cost of prolongation of war for single w r eek. As to political demands they may be comprised under six points above mentioned or others might be added. Whatever they are they w T ill certainly be aimed at freeing Persia from the hold two Powers have in various direc tions over her. Apart from purely geographical conditions our hold has mainly been established in recent past through Persia’s financial dependence on two Powers and such is chaos reigning here it may be safely assumed that if all Persia’s debt were extinguished to-morrow and large sum given to her to start afresh with, her financial embarrassments will in very few years again reduce her to depend on us so that to re-establish our present hold we shall again have requisite lever in our hands.12 Balance of advantage in favour of alliance seems to me therefore to be enormous on our side and I venture to urge that great concessions can be made to Persia to secure her alliance. I surest Bussian Minister and I be authorised to open negotiations at once for this purpose while Persian Government is well disposed. If 1 ersian Government demands are too exorbitant, negotiations can be dropped; we at all events gain time meanwhile, I hear first rate authority that inducements which Germans are holding out to Persia are being daily increased and they produce certain effect on credulous Persian mind impossible of realization as they are.

I had desired Mr. New to make a more extensive tour down the boun dary to Duroh and other villages as it appeared improbable that he would ever again have so favourable an opportunity for touring this winter after my own departure from Birjand, but the suggestion was found impracticable for the reasons given by the Vice-Consul. 3. Mr. New r has acquired some useful information, but I am not entirely prepared to accept all the inferences which he puts forward. I submit the following observations of my own— (а) Ali Akbar Beg is undoubtedly a rogue whose sentiments in the main are hostile to us on account of the pressure w r e put upon the late Hisam-ud-Dowleh and his son Hashmat-ul-Mulk to pay compensation for the Neh raid. His claim to be Shaukat-ul- Mulk’s servant has been denied by the latter, but in my opinion he wrould not dare now-a-days to act in any serious matter con trary to the present Governor’s view T s. It is a fact that he had sent me two belated and stale news reports before Mr. New went out; this was done probably out of fear that our troops would pay him a special visit. I have promised him a good reward if he betrays any Germans into our hands, but I have little hope of any valuable result. (б) The story about the Mirza’s two telegrams is scarcely worthy of credence. I think I should certainly have heard if they had ever reached the Neh, Birjand or Kain telegraph offices, and it is not apparent why Ali Akbar Beg did not himself undertake to get copies sent away. If the telegrams really were written I presume that they must have held some hidden meaning. (c) The story about Asghar Zadeh leaving Herat for^ Meshed has been corroborated in Meshed Confidential Diary No. 41 for the week ending the 9th October 1915, but it has not been ascertained that he ever succeeded in passing through Khurasan. (d) I am not inclined to accept the view that the villagers of Sunni Khana are well disposed towards the Germans and Turks because they are mostly on bad terms with the Governor’s family. I believe that since the late Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s death these Sunnis ha\e not been badly treated, and they have little desire to be annexed to Afghanistan from which country they are not infre quently harassed by raiders even now-a-days.{e) It seems probable that the earlier stories which reached me about Afghan Agents buying up stocks of supplies in Sunni Khana Tillages were incorrect not as regards the visits but as regards the results. The Sunnis of the Julga (valley) do not wish to see any Afghan force marching through their district mainly because it was so badly devastated by locusts last June. (/) The report which reached Mr. New that the Governor had issued instructions for the arrest of Germans and other strangers was incorrect. I particularly asked His Excellency if it was true, and he has denied it saying that he had only impressed upon his subordinates the necessity for prompt reports of such persons’ movements. 4. Mr. New has all this summer held an opinion about the Governor’s sincerity and friendliness towards our Government more assured than my own, and I must admit that His Excellency’s personal relations with all the English in Birjand have been as pleasant of late as they were in the preceding years. I am, however, more and more becoming converted to the view that his poli tical sympathies are really with the Germans. In the first place he detests our Allies the liussians, both on general and on personal grounds, and in the second his most intimate associates, the two chief military officers and the ex-Director of Kevenues, are undoubtedly pro-German. The soldiers openly express their admiration for Germany, but the Finance officer Seyid Mohsin who never discussed them in my presence, has probably done the greatest mischief. He was doubtless sent to Birjand in the Autumn of 1914 for the very purpose of alienating the Governor from our side. It is rather a significant fact that when His Excellency was informed of the British victory at Nut-al-Amarah he refrained from expressing a single word of congratulation. He is not in my opinion benevolently neutral towards us now, but I think that he considers himself still to be strictly and literally neutral. If nut to any serious test I believe that he will show nis benevolence to the other side. Enclo. to Serial No. 106. No. 152, dated Birjand, the 17th October 1915. From— R. H New, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Brijand, To— Major F. B. Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, I have the honour to report that under your instructions I left Birjand on the 21st September on tour in the Julgi-i-Sunni Khaneh and Zir Kuh districts, to visit various villages through which the German party and Herr Paschen passed, and ascertain the general impression they created in these districts. 2. I was accompanied by 10 of your escort and 8 Persian and Afghan levies. I also took my Mirza, Seyid Ghulam Roza and one Ghulam of the Vice-Consulate. 3. Halts were made at the following places visited on the dates noted • 2 let September Aliabad • 16 miles. 22nd n Isfizar 13 22nd t&gt; Naozad . 16 » 23rd ii Dareh-i-Charm 16 it 28rd }• Takhtiban 14 it 24th it Pish Bar . 15 it 24th a Bashiran . 14 it 25th it Muharaadabad 18 a 26th it Gumeh 15 n 26th it Gulmiran. 12 a 27th it Gazik . 17 n 27th it Awaz 4 &gt;t 28th it Ah Garm . 8 a 29th ti Taghan 16 a 29th it Furg • 8 it 80th tt Bushkaz . 17 a 1st October To Birjand . • 32 it tt14 to send bill to 4 At Naozad on the 24th September I heard that a force of more than 400 Afghans had collected at Yazdan (in Persian territory) three days previously, but enquiry proved the report to be entirely ialse. Here, unfortunately, two of our horses broke dcvra and I had back one of them to P.irjand with a Persian levy. There is a difficult negotiate before reaching Naozad with a very steep cescent. ° 5 At Takhtiban I met Ali Akbar Beg, who, according to report, had done a good deal, to help the Germans. He is intelligent and cunning and was, until two years ago, Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s Tahvildar m Sis an. Now he claims to be a servant of Shoukat-ul-Mulk. He has a good house at lakhtiban, which is a large village of some 1,500 inhabitants, and he appeared to have a good supply of grain, for he supplied my requirements and said 1 would have found difficulty in procuring grain elsewhere in the village. 6. I accused Ali Akbar Beg of having helped the German party which passed through the village in July and Herr Paschen. He was perfectly frank and said he had made it his business to appear friendly to them in order to o'et at their secrets and intentions for the information of his master, Shoukat-ul-Mulk. He boasted of having some days previously sent you a report, through Jawala Singh, of Paschen s movements, and asked me to pay for the Kossid who carried the report to Birjand. He did all he could for my party, and placed his house at my disposal. My impression is that Ali Akbor Beg did rather more for the Germans than was necessary, but that his motive was simply mercenary. I think he is a rogue who would give Paschen or any one else away to the highest bidder and willingly serve two or more masters. 7. Ali Akbar was quite open about Paschen’s doings and he gave me a complete account of his return from Afghanistan, with despatches, which is as follows : — Paschen reached Takhtiban from Herat on the 20th Shaval by the Gozukht route, the shortest from Yazdan but very difficult for horses and mules. He left for Duruksh next day. On reaching Naoghab Ghiek, 3 farsakhs from Sehdeh, he learned that the road was held by Indian and Cossack patrols. He remained at Naoghab Chiek for two nhrhts looking for an opportunity to get through, and on the third day returned to Jarf, a small Kalata near Takhtiban. Here Paschen sent for Ali Akbar and discussed the prospects of getting through to Tabas, suggesting he could disguise himself as a shepherd or a camelman. Paschen was greatly agitated. He said he had no care for his life but could not aPord to lose the despatches he carried, a big parcel from which he showed Ali Akbar two telegrams, which he said were given to him by their Persian Mirza, a Tehrani, named Mirza Husein Khan, for despatch from Kain. These telegrams were (1) To German Minister, Tehran, asking that his (the Mirza’s) things might be sent with 50 Gandermes to Birjand, and (2) To German Consul, Ispahan, asking for Ts. 2,500. Ali Akbar further states that Paschen told him the Persian officer of their sowars Askar Zadeh, had also left Herat with despatches for Ispahan travelling via Meshed. He advised Paschen not to attempt the journey to Tabas, and the latter left the same night for Herat, again travelling by the Gozukht road. 8. The German party seems to have been well received at Takhtiban, where, besides Ali Akbar Beg, a person named Mirza Muhammad Khan, gave them considerable assistance in procuring supplies. They camped on an open space of ground near water; on the outskirts of the village. I gathered that many Sunnis in the Juigi district who are mostly on bad terms with the governing family of Kainat, were well disposed towards the Germans and Turks accompanying them, but the party do not appear to have created any real impression even in Takhtiban, as they were regarded as fugitives. They paid liberally for supplies and guides. At Gozukht they are spoken badly of as they threatened the people and forcibly broke open se* era! ambars in search of grain, which they seem to have been told at Takhtiban was procurable at Gozukht.I understand, Niedenlmeyer, who was head of the party spoke Persian fluently, but Paschen knew only a little Persian. Paschen, I gathered, is tall and heavily built, with fair hair and green eyes and wears a longish fair beard. His dress was of Khaki, with tunic, and he wore a forage cap, with a gold band and badge in front. 9. Ali Akbar asked me for employment and claimed to have done much work for the boundary commission in years past. I told him he had success fully hidden Paschen’s movements until he had got safely away; that we would not employ anyone desirous of serving both sides, but if he would prove his worth by giving us timely information of any other German Emissaries, which might lead to a capture, he could expect a very liberal present from us. 10. At Takhtiban I heard that the Deputy Governor of the Zir Kuh district, Naib Ali Beg, who was sent to Zir Kuh from Birjand by Shoukat-ul- Mulk some 20 days previously was of Aviz. I was inclined to be suspicious of this individual’s doings and decided to proceed to Aviz and meet him. At Bashiran, 2 farsakhs from Aviz, I learned the Naib had gone to Muhamadabad. I met him there and found that his tour in the Zir Kuh district was quite innocent and that he had, on the contrary, received instructions from Shoukat- ul-Mulk to arrest any Germans or other strangers. The truth of this seemed to be borne out by the fact that soon after I reached Muhamadabad a sowar from i viz arrived there with a report for the Naib that 57 strange sowars had reached Bashiran the previous day. It was my party. 11. I had heard a report that Naib Ali Beg had been collecting grain at Aviz. He confirmed it and explained that a party of Cossacks had lately visited Aviz, and as the people there had been put to some trouble in supply ing them with grain, he had laid in a stock from outlying villages in order to be able to cope with the requirements of any other party of Cossacks going there. Naib Ali Beg had no news except that he had been ordered by Shoukat- ul-Mulk to visit Shahrakhs and Yazdan. He asked me to petition Shoukat-ul- Mulk to allow him to return to Birjand. I hear the Naib had in 20 days managed to collect for himself 600 tomans from Zir Kuh villages. 1?. From Muhamadabad I intended visiting Malaki and Gozukht, and touring the Eastern side of the Ahanga^an hills to Awaz, but unfortunately the condition of my horses and mules, which had had a very trying time over much sl.ony ground through difficult hills, would not permit it, and after visit ing Ahangaran, I cut through the hills by way of Gumeh to Gulmeran, a place through which the German party and Paschen passed. There is no village at Gulmeran and fodder had to be sent on ahead from Muharaadabad. I heard here that very little fodder was obtainable at Gozukht and that the Germans had threatened the people there and broken open several ambars in search of grain. 13. Thence I moved to Awaz via Gazik. Here there was a report that a German (possibly Paschen) had passed Sabzwar (in Afghanistan) a few days previously, travelling south. There was also information of another party of 8 Germans who were said to have got through to Herat from Kerman by a route near Neh into Afghanistan. Both these reports were vague and I could not get at their source. 14. I would have proceeded to Duroh, 60 miles south of Awaz, to try and gather some confirmation of the above reports, but even after a day’s halt at Awaz, the condition of my animals w*as so poor, many of the horses and mules having cast shoes which could not be renewed, that I was compelled to return to Birjand by w T ay oi Furg and Bushkaz. 15. The people of Awaz spoke very highly of Bahmat Ali. He seems to have carried out his duties with tact and made himself popular there. The scheme of intelligence which he controls, of 6 mounted sowars and 6 footmen, is eminently practical and well organized.16 16 .

On the route followed by the German party from Takhtiban, through Gulmiran, Gorukht, Malaki, Yazdan, toTngat in Afghanistan, a distance of about 100 miles, practically no gram is now procurable. 18 Dafedar Muhammad Khan, who was in charge of my Escort was most helpful. He obtained his supplies en route often at very moderate prices, without any friction, and the entire party behaved very well. Die Dafedar also did his utmost to nurse the horses by dismounting his men at bad places in the hills. 19. I made notes of all routes traversed which I hope to submit in the course of a few days.1 Telegram P., No. 279-C., dated (and received) the 4th November 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Sistan, To —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Please refer to my telegram No. 271-C., dated the 29th October—it was sent. in the belief that war was imminent. The British Minister at Tehran had just informed me that he had asked for permission to present an ultimatum to the Persian Government. Orders had also been sent to me to destroy Cypher Code f&lt; P In event of a similar crisis recurring and developing unfavourably the Officer Commanding column and I have no clear orders as to what we should do. The Baluch Sardars of Sistan are, I believe, inimical to the present Governor Shaukat-ul-Mulk and thoroughly disloyal to the Persian Government. If they were assured that they would not be punished at the termination of the war or if we announced our intention of annexing the province they will side with us. Though really preferring British rule to that of either Afghanistan or Persia they would desert us if Afghanistan also entered the war on the side of our enemies. If Baluch Sardars join us and Afghanistan remains neutral our position here would be secure until Germans and Turks arrive in force, but if jehad is taken up at once by the Afghans we should, I think, have to make as quickly as possible for British territory hardly waiting for the contingent at Birjand who perhaps would do better to go to Meshed and join the Russians. Telegraphic communication would presumably be cut on or even before the outbreak of hostilities Repeated to Tehran and addressed to Government of India. 2 Telegram P., No. 234, dated (and received) the 4th November 1915.

His surrender was demanded by the Acting Karguzar, but I replied to the effect that so long as the presence of British and Russian troops was required in Persia for the maintenance of peace and to prevent our enemies’ Agents from obtaining access into Afghanistan I declined even by one man to reinforce our enemies.

We said it lay not with us but with Russian Government to arrest the movement of troops. Government had our assurance that troops came only for protection of colonies and legations and that it was duty of Cabinet to explain this to people and make it clear that there was no hostile intention in the movement of troops towards capital. His Excel lency pressed us to say what we desired Government to do to obtain return of troops to Kasvin. We replied that essential thing was to remove ]ar°-e number of Germans, Austrians and Turks and seize arms, etc., which German legation possessed. He promised Germans, Austrians, etc., should be removed to a safe distance from Tehran and kept under guard and that Government8 would try to obtain possession of arms. He added that our safety would be absolutely guaranteed by Swedish Government. E-ussian Minister promised to report, what Minister foi hoieign Affairs bad said to Petrograd.

X then pressed JVXinister for Foreign All'airs to tell us terms on which Persian Government were willing to adopt benevolent neutrality towards the two Powers. After dilating on necessity (for) conciliating public opinion His Excellency produced them as follows :— (1) Settlement of purely Russian question that is strict observance. of Treaty (of) Turcomanshai and collection of revenue(s) by Russian Consols. (2) Request for arms, etc., to form Persian Army. (3) Revision of tariff. (4) If other neutral countries are allowed to send delegates, Persia to be represented at peace conference. (5) Undertaking (to) withdraw Russian troops from all parts of Persia to be discussed at a later date in a friendly spirit. (6) Cancellation of recognition by Persia of 1907 Convention as well (as) of other undertakings obtained by ultimatum in 1911. I said consideration of public opinion could hardly have inspired inser tion points (3) and (4). During the six months I had been in Persia neither point had been even mentioned by Minister or in press and as for number 4 it looked as if it was of German origin. I feared that in London list would not make a favourable impression. Russian Minister concurred. He said as regards (1) that although he had repeatedly expressed his readiness to discuss these points, and he was equally prepared to do so still, Persian Government four months ago had not cared to discuss questions involved. As to (5) conversations had taken place between Persian Government and his predecessor and could be renewed. We agreed to inform our Governments of Persian Government’s proposals and recommend sympathetic consideration. (?)

Reference my telegram immediately preceding. Minis ter of Education called last night about 9-30 and stayed till 1-20 a.m. He said he had been sent by Cabinet to obtain answers on two points (a) on what terms we would withdraw troops to Kasvin and (h) on what terms were we prepared to negotiate for Persia’s benevolent neutrality on terms communi cated by Minister for Foreign Affairs to us. There was, I said, little to add as regards («) to what Russian Minister and I had already told Minister for Foreign Affairs, that is that it did not lie (? with) us. It seemed to me as if hint thrown out by Minister for Foreign Affairs about Government retiring to Ispahan was nothing but a threat ( ? that) if we did not agree to Persia’s requirements in return for her bene volent neutrality, Persia would throw in her lot with Germany. I was not much impressed by threat as I was convinced Shah would not care to take left seat in Prince Reuss carriage and I knew Cabinet did not wish to see Persia involved in war which could only have results for her which would be disastrous. If in its professions ?) towards us Government was sincere it should have the courage to declare its policy openly and let the world know that it frankly accepted our assurances (that) the troops had been moved merely to insure safety of Legation, etc , and had no purpose of an unfriendly kina. We had by according moratorium already given proof of our friendliness and we must have some corresponding sign from Persia. His Excellency said that the approach of troops might have disastrous effects in provinces. I retort (ed ?) that position of our Consuls could hardly be worse than it is if there is any objection to entirely passive attitude of Government and gendarmerie’s open hostility. As to (ft) whole thing looked like blackmail but we were now in a position of defence ? ? I replied ? ? and to ask us to abandon that advantage was ridiculous. If troops now withdrew to Kasvin I should pro bably be in same plight myself as Consul, Shiraz, who has not been able to leave his garden for two months. That position I declined to accept. Nearer troops came the better I should be pleased. As to substance of Persian proposals the more I thought of them the less I understood spirit in which they had been framed. To accept them in principle as he suggested sounded well but any acceptance at all as regards two of them was fully impossible (?) I would communicate them to you and report your reply to Persian Government. It was significant that Minister said little or nothing about departure to Ispahan and so long as we stand fast and allow troops to move nearer situation may be saved. If we show weakness it certainly will be lost. In German Legation there is great activity large quantities of flour furniture, etc., are being packed some being (?) sent to American Legation during the night. Town perfectly quiet, Secret.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Please refer to my telegram immediately preceding. This morning Russian Minister and I met Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs by appointment. Ministers dilated at great length on necessity for conciliating public opinion and upon recall of troops to Kasvin. They said, that as soon as that was clone, and two Governments had agreed to discuss terms on which Persia would adopt benevolent neutrality, Persian Government would declare their determination to put an end to German intrigues, etc., publicly. We said that movement of troops was not under our control and that situation here in any case did not warrant their withdrawal. Persian Government had promised to remove Austrian prisoners and take other mea sures but had done absolutely nothing but provide few guards armed with unserviceable rifles, for defence of Legation. Orders to troops could not be modified m these circumstances. Meanwhile as to proposed negotiations we might expect instructions from our Governments. By accepting moratorium Persian Government had practically pledged themselves to benevolent neutra lity and had no cause whatever to regard presence of troops as unfriendly If Government was sincere in their professions they would at once make this clear to public and our Governments. Minister said that they could not take such a step m face of public opinion. 17 T un( ^ ersta J 1 ^ n g tfoit so long as Mujahidin are not dis- lOHi W0 'i &lt;1 not movc , J ack -, Persian Government say that until after 10th Moharrem, November 18th, this cannot be safely done. form^tli^a^ cv! *° W11 ffi aSt \ s k e li ev ed for Hamadan and I can in- 101 m that all German officers here did the same.n It would seem certain mules were utilized to carry to Hamadanarms, etc., mentioned in my immediately preceding telegram and if this is so Govern ment had already connived at this move. German Minister has left his Legation and lives in house adjoining f United States Legation. To-day attitude of Minister was entirely unsatisfactory and (?) I think troops should without delay move nearer to Tehran. Sent to India, Petrograd, addressed to Foreign Office. 36 Telegram P., No. 34-D.

Could you not create a diversion in the Sarhad ? Ends* 38 Telegram P., No. 284-C., dated the 11th (received 12th) November 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Kerman.) Please refer to your telegram 245 of the 8th November. I fail to under stand the advantage of diversion suggested. The Germans it appears are making for Afghanistan in two parties from Nain and Kerman respectively and I suspect that they may have with them northern party and a wireless apparatus brought from Baghdad via Ispahan. They cannot with tribesmen alone make much impression against either Kacha or Sistan and to weaken our line between Kain and Sistan would seem to be play(ing) (the) German game. I have an idea that the most important party of enemy will come through Naiband and the lesser party will make for Neh. They will probably try to amalgamate eventually^ in which case the northern party will I think pass south of Birjand. Our Sistan and Birjand detachments have a most difficult task to intercept these two parties owing to the fact that the Germans travel so fast and that it is almost, impossible to get adequate notice of movement of the more northern parties. We rely chiefly as regards lesser party upon news through you from Bavar and Khabis but we have also got scouts at Deh Salm and are sending others to Khabis. Until he is joined by some Germans with machine guns, Jehind cannot, I think, help our enemies beyond wrecking telegraph line and office(s) at Dehaneh Baghit and Bam.12 39 Telegram P., dated (and received) the 12th November 1915.

(Addressed Foreign Office, London, repeated to Petrograd, Basrah and Bushire.) With reference to my immediately preceding telegram, I have heard from Minister for Foreign Affairs who denies all knowledge of any such occur rences at Shiraz. The story it is just possible is a German invention made up with the object of influencing events at the capital. A story of very much the same kind was circulated here regarding Hamadan which proved entirely without foundation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs talked in the most friendly way and asked whether Russian Minister and I mistrusted the present Cabinet. If we did so a Cabinet could easily be formed that would enjoy our confidence. The Shah, he declar ed, had no intention of leaving the capital. The Persian Government seems to be on the point of coming over to us. The German Agents are still moving from Tehran and their flight has naturally shaken the belief in them, There is also an exodus of their adherents. 41 Telegram P., No. R.-333, dated the 12th (received 13th) November 1915, From—The Hon’blb Lieutknant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.L, K C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Knt, through Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. The great importance of preventing as long as possible the news from becoming public in the event of a rupture with Persia, is again urged by the Consul, Mohammerah,—in order to give the Sheikh time to assemble the heads of tribes. In the cases of other friendly elements the same considerations apply. It would appear that the only effective means of securing this would he to seize the Persian telegraph offices at Tehran as early as possible. Can Director make any suggestions as to particular measures which could be taken m the provinces.

Please see your telegram 284-C. An informer of mine who has had confidential talk with Daood Ali and another Indian who is addressed by them as Professor, reports having decided against trying to get through in small parties (of) six ; they mean to make the next attempt in force : that Jehind has promised them assistance: the route through Deh Salm is that selected : and Zugmeyer will join them from here. This person was some time among the Baluchis. It appears from the reports from Yezd that all the Germans are collected there. My opinion is that they will come on by Zarand Pass north of here either to Khabis or a point near it where they trust to meet the Baluchis: while Zugmeyer with 100 to 150 Persians will probably join on as they pass. Special sowars have been posted by me at the road due north of here and I will try to send you information of exact route taken as early as possible. Further an arrangement has been made by me for an attack on Jehind’s home by his enemies in the customary course and I thought that you might perhaps to able to take similar action in the north in order to draw him back to his own country. 45 Telegram P., dated the 12th (received 13th) November 1915.

S. of the 8th November. I fear it may not later on be practicable to get Sardars on our side if ground is no now thoroughly prepared. Ten days ago at my request Sardar Khudad-ad Khan sent one hundred and fifty camels to Nushki but he was cautioned against doing this and threatened by both Deputy Governor and late Revenue Director. Several other Baluch notables have offered to supply me with sowars and riflemen to oppose Germans. They do not at present take Germans seriously but news is beginning to filter in about Jehind joining Germans and lar^e number of Bakhtiaris on Germans side. Consequently Sistan Sardars may begin to think official policy (of) neutrality more politic and unless we haveu previously bound them whole keartedly by liberal treatment to our side if their country eventually is dragged into war they will have to follow. May I commence entertaining sowars and riflemen up to two hundred from tribes which I consider most trustworthy and inform their Saidais at once that British txovernment will safeguard them and levies whom . they supply to us from Persian Government’s anger ? As latter are permitting Germans freely to entertain Persians against us it does not seem that Persian Government can object though local authorities may do so.

Knowledge that our friends will stand by us and that we are acquiring new friend(s) will on the contrary influence Persian Government more favourably towards us. ^ Germans are making great effort(s) to bring about movement in many parts of the country in their favour but until Persian Government has taken a decision here any great success in that manner is doubtful. Their object of course is to show Persian Government that advance of the Russian troops has roused whole of Persia against us.

Shah received Russian Minister and me in audience to-day and conver sation lasted more than two hours. After explaining to Shah that presence of troops denoted no hostile intention towards Persia but quite contrary we urged that modification of Cabinet should be made such as would satisfy our Governments that Persia meant to carry out engagement to put an end to enemy intrigue implied by acceptance from us of financial support and that a declaration should be published of Government’s new policy of benevolent declaration towards us. His Majesty would agree only to nomination of a Minister of the Interior whose presence in the Cabinet would inspire two Governments with confidence but this only provided troops first returned to Kasvin. We told His Majesty that this was impossible and we were unable to move him from that position although we gave him to understand in unmistakeable language that if Persian Government did not act against Germans, Russian troops would undertake that task and that if Persia allowed herself to be driven into war against us results to Persia and to himself would be disastrous. His attitude was unsatisfactory and obstinate. I understand interview yesterday of repre sentatives of enemy with Minister for Foreign Affairs was as inconclusive as our own to-day.

This is quite a new departure. The Risaldar usually reports that the Russians have virtually no troops left on the frontier and are in terror of the Afghans. The Russians are sending Jamshidi immigrants back to Afghanistan. The Amir has sent orders that the artillery men who failed to help the Kurramis when the latter were attacked by robbers (see Diary No. 32) should be imprisoned.

One; of the Germans appears to be Paschen, who has returned from the frontier. The Governor has lent them three horses to ride and has sent them flowers from his garden. He has also forwarded with his own post a letter from them to their friends in Kabul. These Germans are said to be making secret preparations for leaving Herat.

See Diary No. 40. The robbery of my post sowar between the frontier and Herat was not the result of a German intrigue, for the postbags were untouched, but the agent at Herat, in speaking to the Governor on the subject, attributed it to the Germans.

It would take time and probably produce no result apart from other considerations. If possible you should inform Agent that }ou are fully cognisant of his proceedings and warn him that his conduct will be brought to notice of Amir if he does not desist from such talk. This will probably make him act more prudently. Hepeated to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. 82 Telegram P., No. S. 1063, dated the 20th October 1915.

Following telegram, No. 413, received from Shiraz :— Begins. Reference Government of India telegram No. 1063 S. Question of future expenditure in Ears. As (directed?) I have submitted proposals for subsidising Kawam and Soulet, in order to enable them to restore aud maintain order in Ears, more especially at Shiraz, on main road, and in littoral districts. This expenditure, although nominally a subsidy, amounts in reality to financing of Ears administration rattier than to ordinary secret service expenditure. It may in fact be regarded as diversion to two Illkhanis, of the funds originally sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government for use of gendarmerie, in order to enable former to perforin duties which we can no longer safely entrust to latter. It would appear from telegram under reference that Government of India is not prepaied to include such charges under the heading “ secret service”, and 1 would therefore request you kindly to take question of necessary funds in this connection into consideration. As already reported, 1 have not yet had opportunity of ascertaining views of two illkhanis regarding whom 1 (telegraphed ?) but I hope to be able to submit definite proposals during course of next few days. The sum mentioned in my telegram No. 395 is maximum and I believe thirty thousand pounds should actually the ?) (sufficient ?) figure. In view of fact that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to provide fifty thousand pounds for gendarmerie of Ears, they will per naps agree to devote this or lesser sum to subsidising of the two lllkhani in execution of proposed programme.

SCape in dis S uise . to p ersia from Russia, Persian P f eisian Government are in agreement with tne TurkishAmbassador and the Austrian Charge d’Affaires. Please refer to my telegrams Nos. 87 and 88; the three Austrian prisoners mentioned therein were sent here by an a^ent in Russian territory named Mirza Jawad Khan and were actually brouehtV one Mohamet Sadie Beg vid Kakhha to Meshed. Amin-ul-lah Khan is another agent in Russia. The whereabouts of these two agents are unknown to me but I have letter addressed to the former from Karguza-r here in which he makes mention of Mery and Baku as places where he is most likely to meet latter. There are, however, I am informed by my colleague, no prisoners at Mery and that where there are prisoners the agents must be looked for. At Askabad there are still some prisoners. The letter from the Karo'uzar bears his private seal and is, I think, in his own handwriting, though disguised somewhat. The receipt of the three Austrian prisoners is acknowledged by him with thanks and he praises Jawad Khan for the energy displayed by him and encourages him to hope for handsome rewards from Turkish Ambassador and German and Austrian Legations. . Zahir-ul-Mulk is mentioned by him. Zahir is I believe in charge of the Turkish section of the Foreign Office as Agent who is conducting negotiations with Turkish Ambassador and Austrian Charge d’Affaires in this connection : Zahir-ul- Mulk is Karguzar’s brother-in-law. When the Karguzar sent off the three Austrian prisoners he telegraphed to Minister for Foreign Affairs in cypher saying he was carrying out his instructions regarding the observance of secrecy in receiving and despatching .prisoners of war. This course of action, therefore, leads me to believe that the Persian Gov ernment are mixed up in the affair. Though others may have gone by other routes, I do not think (please see my telegram No. 85) that any considerable number of fugitives has passed through here, probably not more than three in question. As Sadie Beg seems to be retiring from business, I do not think he will return to Russia. The letter from the Karguzar was to have been delivered to Jawad Khan by him.

Sardar Ashja gave me special assurances respecting protection of Julfa telegraph office and so long as these are carried out Ashja should be able to keep Minister well informed of general aspect of situation even if unable to furnish full details re under currents. I am not aware if other arrangements have been made subsequently or would be possible.

I am not aware of its contents hut in all probability it authorised him to remain. The Governor-General has received a cypher telegram from the Admiralty (Minister for Foreign Affairs ?) through the Karguzar in which he is directed to report the number of prisoners of war belonging to Austria waiting on the frontier for guides and the number which have already arrived at villages in Persia. He has also been directed to assist in sending them to Tehran secretly.

Consul, Shiraz, telegraphs as follows:—“ No. 423, October 25th. General situation. “ I am I fear now* forced to submit my opinion to you that it is im possible for us to remain here any longer unless Persian Government are prepared to take immediately vigorous steps to set matters right in Pars. Tw t o outrages have now been committed with perfect impunity and that others will follow is certain. With the exception of my private servant and (Psowars) all have been either wounded or killed, and I am practically a prisoner myself. Together with our friends and employes, Kaw r am and I are constantly threatened with assassination. In fact situation is intoler able and is I venture to think one to w r hich no representative of Great Britain should be expected to submit. Of course I am most reluctant to recommend evacuation of Pars and I myself am quite prepared to remain in region as long as agent of His Majesty’s Government at Tehran considers this desirable, but no useful purpose it seems to me can be served by our remaining here in such circumstances any longer, and I am reluctant that our friends and employes should be exposed to further risks. I do not think as long as German Consul43 Repeated to Basrah and Petrograd. and agents remain in Fars that any improvement can be expected in situation. Tjnless Persian Government are prepared and able to have them removed, ln mv opinion it is better for us to withdraw. I fear neither Kawam or Soulet can be relied on to deal with situation adequately. “ One advantage of withdrawal would be that it would enable our author ities in Gulf and elsewhere to undertake such military and other measures as may be considered advisable. Persian Government, I would suggest should be informed of expulsion of British from Shiraz and that it entails on the part of His Majesty’s Government following measures: &lt;£ A. Military occupation of Sistan and Arabistan Gulf ports. “ B. • Stoppage until situation in Persia is satisfactory of all trade with Southern Persia both import and export. “Withdrawal from Kerman and Yezd might be also necessary. Addressed Minister; repeated Resident, Bushire.” Ends. jyr Of course if we can no longer look to Soulet and Kawam to save situation in Pars I see nothing for it but to direct Consul and British Colony to leave but though position of Consul is beyond question vcny perilous^ I can hardlv think after his repeated expressions of completion (confidence ?) in them that these individuals are really incapable of taking effective action piovided we are ready to finance them and that they understand that we look to them to administer province almost independently of central Government. Wb must expect if Consul leaves to see both Kawam and Soulet fall into enemy s camp and effect on Kuhgelus and even on Bakhtiari would be deplorable. Of course I am most reluctant to ask Consul to remain in a position of so much danger, but interests at stake make it necessary it appears to me to hold out as long as possible. I think Kawam should be able to provide sufficient torce to protect Consulate if we can find requisite money. Unless Indian military authorities can find sufficient force to undertake expedition inland simultaneous ly with contemplated reinforcement of Russian troops at Kasvin, I can see no advantages in evacuation. Occupation of Gulf Ports would have little useful effect and indeed would probably only result in adding fuel to hostility which has been raised against us by Germans. Repeated Petrograd and Sir P.

From—His Britannic 'Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To— The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Twenty Hazaras are being despatched to Birjand by Consul-General, Meshed, to join the 80 already received and Consul-General is of opinion that he can supply another 50 if we can equip them. He has also made an offer to permit Captain Thorburn to remain for some months in charge of these levies. The proposals have been discussed by the Officer Commanding, Nasratabad, and myself and he gladly welcomes both. In view of objections of the Chief of the General Staff to locate regular troops at any place other than Birjand, Sistan and Kacha, his idea is that levies should be posted in parties of about 20 at every stage along the trade route up to Kain, having the cross roads watched by scouts. Our present number of levies is not sufficient for this work. The services of Thorburn as Inspector of levy posts and Commander of same would be most valuable as he understands the local conditions and the men, while none of the military officers with the Column can speak the Persian language. For the present his headquarters would be at Birjand where there is also no officer of the Indian Medical Service. Our Martini ammunition is unreliable, old and not enough in quantity. It is suggested by Colonel Wikeley that all levies may if possible be armed with Lee-Enfield rifles of old pattern, the supply of which can perhaps be obtained from India. It is understood by me that the General Staff are of opinion that the Com manding Officer should spend more money on arrangements for obtaining intelligence but the difficulty is in obtaining men who can be trusted. On both questions very early orders are solicited. Addressed to Government of India.1 % 'V ! &amp;iO 9 P 423? '915 — '&gt; L ’ From t iceroy, 16t/? November 1915. Foreign Secret.

Germans have been showing great activity for last few days. Large quantities of ammunition and arms and, it is said, bombs are being imported and German agents have increased considerably in number. Of course exact figures are not obtainable, but from reports received by me it is evident that Germans are constantly arriving in compara tively large numbers and in all Persia there cannot, I think, be less than two hundred and fifty Austrians, sixty Germans, most of whom are escaped prisoners of war from Trans-Caspia, and perhaps fifty Turks, renegade Indians, &amp;c., with eight thousand rifles, seven or eight machine guns, bombs, &amp;c. Insignificant as this force would be elsewhere, iu Persia it is formidable with gendarmerie is entirely, and police probably disalfected, and with rigorous pressure and the worst elements in the country in the enemy’s pay. In addition to above, funds are being more lavishly spent than ever. Probably this spurt is due to their fear of the imminent fall of Baghdad which event would (include ?) present release eastward of line of communica tion with Constantinople and also to probable arrival of Grand Duke in Caucasus which may imply military measures of a more rigorous nature in Persia. If I am correct in this surmise, Germans’ supreme efiort w r ould appear to be imminent. I have not enough material to foretell with certainty the direction it will take, but for the present Hamadan appears to be present focus of attack. British Consul there is being openly threatened by German Consul w r ho gives out he is going to avenge arrest of Turkish Consul at liesht. The latter is said to have three hundred tribesmen who are led by a German in his piy and against these the Governor, who is timid though well disposed, has possibly extremely ill led men while police and gendarmerie forces are untrustworthy. Though Persian Government have sent, a hundred Persian Cossacks from Tehran they admit the gravity of the situation and that the Consuls are in great danger. Kussian Minister is requesting permission from his Government to despatch a regiment of Cossacks from Jlasvin. Provided they are not detained for an indefinite period there, I think, that would be good (move?); but we must not be led into undue weakening of our only force which is within striking distance of Tehran. Wassmuss is making great efiorts in Pars to prevent new Governor of Bushire from going to take up his post. Sultanabad is threatened. It seems evident that Germans intend to make a move of some kind in Tehran, from fact that Swedish commandant of gendarmerie has been making enquiries of Armenians as to what attitude they would adopt if Persian Government should declare themselves on side of either of belligerents or if an attack were to be made on Cnristians. In month of Monarram which begins now attempt would be certainly made as this is the time religious fanaticism easily roused.

The following has been received from Consul at Shiraz. “ For preserva tion of order in Pars we must now depend on Kawam and Soulet and we could not remain in Shiraz any longer without their goodwill and help. Both of these men have professed friendly feelings for us and Kawam especially has given evidence of his good faith. Therefore as matters are at present we must continue to depend on these two chiefs and to help them financially. Till end of present financial year I suggest following rough programme :—(1) As cost of maintaining garrison at Shiraz subsidy to Kawam to defray expenses of say 1,000 men. We could not, in present circumstances, stay here a day if his men were withdrawn. (2) To defray cost of expedition carried out either by him c elf or by one of his brothers to restore order in littoral districts and on Bushire road subsidy to Soulet. (3) To maintain order on main road subsidy to both Illkhanis. At present I cannot frame even a rough estimate of w’hat these subsidies will amount to, but as Government of India have asked for an estimate of expenses to end of present financial year, I suggest the figure at fifty thousand pounds. Ends. I am informed by His Majesty’s Consul that he has been given a free hand by you but that without special authority he shrinks from incurring such heavy expenditure. I am of opinion that with feeble and inert Government, which is now in power, scheme offers only reasonable (prospect of ?) combating German efforts and of restoring order (and I ?) (trust ?) expenditure will be sanctioned. In two or three days Soulet will be in neighbourhood of Shiraz and on Soulet’s arrival His Majesty’s Consul should be in a position to negotiate with him. * ° At my request Persian Government have sent a telegram to Kawam giving him full powers to co-operate with Soulet but Pei*sian Government will not be in a position to f urnish much if any money at all. 70 Telegram P., No. 199, dated (and received) the 17th October 1915.

Repeated to Sistan, Kerman, Meshed and Birjand.CONFIDENTIAL A I Meshed Diary No. 37 for the week ending September 11, 1915. Persian Officials. I am informed that the Karguzar is to be recalled. For the last week or so he has been lying in his andarun professing to be unwell, but he has visited the Governor-General once or twice on urgent business connected with the intrigues of both, and on September 9th he was seen driving to visit the Mutawalli Bashi, who is a party to these intrigues, looking particularly well. As the Kar guzar is doing no work and the Governor-General holds no communication with either Consulate-General, business with Persian officials is at a standstill. Most of the Heads of Departments and specially the Commander of the Troops are busily intriguing against the Governor-General, who has disgusted all by his neglect of duty and open venality. The Governor-General is attempting to get the Commander of the Troops dismissed, but it is to be hoped that he will himself be removed. The robber, Muhammad Khurshabadi, has been appointed Chief of the Road Police between Fakhr-i-Daud and Sabzawar on the Tehran road, and has received the title of Khan. Persian Affairs. —The democrats have recently agreed to demand the dismissal of the Governor-General and have sent a telegram to Tehran to that effect. They are also attempting to obtain the dismissal of the head of the provincial Court of Justice, whose own subordinates are intriguing against him. The democrats have recently been talking about the presence of foreign troops in Persia, but have wisely decided that nothing can be done against them without disciplined troops, citing the case of undisciplined Arabs in Mesopotamia who, according to them, numbered 200,000 and lost 40,000 killed when they attempted to face regular troops. Russian Affairs. —At a drinking party at a shrine about six miles from the town, Mir Mahdi, a Russian subject, shot Zain-ul-Abidin, another Russian subject, in the course of a dispute regarding a prostitute. The injured man is still alive and Mir Mahdi has been arrested. Cossacks sent from Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari toNishabur unfortunately missed a caravan of Shirazis bringing arms to Meshed. The pilgrims are said now to be selling their arms in villages on their route, and to Muhammad Khurshabadi. The Shirazi pilgrims who were disarmed at Turbat-i-Haidari are now on their way back to Shiraz, and are said to be troublesome to travellers on the road. It is reported that 400 Cossacks are to be sent to Sabzawar. German Intrigues. —One of the Persians, a Chinarani, arrested at the house of the Austrian dentist, has been detained as a German Agent. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —It is reported that a German doctor who was in Tabas left the place only two days before the arrival of the Cossacks. Colonel Scouratt has returned to Turbat-i-Haidari. The Karguzar at Turbat-i-Haidari, acting under instructions from Tehran, has strongly protested against the arrest of M. Eger by the Russian Consul. The Consul has given the Karguzar an answer which will probably end the affair. Cossacks are now stationed at Tun, Bushruya, Isfak, Dih-i-Muhammad, and Tabas. As I had reason to believe that the Russian Consul was wilfully withholding information from Colonel Gushchin, I ordered the agent to arrange to see ( olonel Gushchin every day and asked the latter always to have an interpretei at hand at the hour fixed. I have received a most grateful letter from Colonel Gushchin, but these squabbles between Russian officials hamper work very much. News from Kanz. —The Kanz district is much disturbed o\v ing to the quarrel between the Barbaris and Taimuris. The Governor, Haji Shuja-ul-Mulk, lias ordered every fourteen families in Kariz to engage a man with a rifle to protect their l. i tvsd on i - • 1 ^ ^ J f Olbwith 5DIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S % i ^ K1 It Letts Ko.

Notwithstanding these precautions a house at Taibat was broken into on the night of September 4th and 150 tumans in cash were stolen. News from Herat. —The Russians are giving land in the Panjdeh district to Muhammad Azim Baig, Faizullah Baig, and the families of 30 other Hazaras of the Firuzkuhi country. The Turkomans do not approve of this invasion of Hazaras and threaten to migrate to Afghanistan to take up the lands vacated by the Hazaras. The Governor of Herat has ordered the frontier guards to stop the emigration of the Hazaras. The Governor of Herat has sent sowars to see that all rubats on the Maimana Kabul, and Kandahar roads are properly stocked with grain, straw and provisions. Responsible officials on the Kabul road have been specially warned to have sup plies ready for the party of Germans expected shortly to travel from Herat to Kabul. A Jew trader has had 28 loads of merchandise robbed at Rubat-i-Ghurian, two farsakhs from Herat. The Governor is sending 100 sowars under Muhammad Haidar Khan, Barakzai, to reinforce the frontier guards under Risalder Yar Muhammad Khan. Habibullah Khan, Achakzai, head of the Khawanin sowars in Herat, has been appointed Mihrmndar to the German party about to be sent to Kabul. An arrival from Farah reports having met there an Afghan who professed to be the bearer of letters between the Amir and his spy or agent in Constantinople. The man received some money from the Governor of Farah and continued his journey to Kabul. The party of Germans, Austrians, etc., is still lodged in the Bagh-i-Shah and the Governor continues to treat the foreigners with great consideration. The strained relations between the Governor and the Commander of the Troops have fortunately led the latter to take the opposite course and he demurred to placing the guaid over them undei the command of a colonel until he received written orders from the Governor to that effect, and warned the Governor that if a colonel were required to watch officers no higher in rank than a captain, the Governor himself would have to command the guard should a German general succeed in escaping across the frontier from Persia. The Germans are not doing much to acquire the good will of the Commander of the Troops and his men. They criticized the rifles describing them as imitation rifles supplied by the British, whereas they came from Kabul arsenal. They also criticized the officers, who, they said, were old and past work, and when, some days afterwards, the Commander of the Troops threatened to dismiss some of the officers, our agent was careful to let it be known that this was what came of German criticism. This has had a good effect. On Friday, August 27th, those of the party who said that they were Turks attended prayers in the mosque and our agent warned the Mulla that they would probably ask to be allowed to recite the Khutbah. The warning was well timed, for this was what the lurks did They were silenced by the answer that the Khutbah could be read on } y ie v a « appointed by the Amir. The Turks, who were escorted to and irom the mosque by a guard, gave 30 tumans to the Mutawalli of the mosque. +t ^ II j U f US ^ ^ ie P art y returned the call of the Governor, who received em in in ar. ur agent could not obtain admission but heard what passed at Sd fi whlch 16 C ° mmand f of the Troops was present.

On August 31st Colonel Abdur Rauf, command^ the wa“d over the party, reported that the Governor had allowed four of the party to Sra to collect the property which they had left on the frontier. These were perhaps Paschen and the four Austrians of whom Major Prideaux has heard The Governor has refused to allow the Germans to take photographs of the shrines in Herat but they have visited Gazurgah and are said to have made plans of Herat and lists of vdlagesm the neighbourhood but they cannot have had an opportun ty of making surveys of any value. They asked the Commander of the Troops for permission to inspect the troops but he has refused it, in the absence of ordersfrom the Amir, and he has also refused to receive a visit in the Ark from the Germans ine Germans have been allowed to visit shrines in and near Herat. On September 1st the Governor visited the Bagh-i-Shah and warned the party to be ready to start for Kabul on Sunday, September 5th. Rupees 10 000 Kabuh have been placed at the disposal of Habibullah Khan for their entertain- ment on the way. A force of sowars said to number 200 is being detained on the frontier at Chah- rig until orders come from the Amir. The sowars say that they belong to a Turkish party. ® Political Summary. Condition of the Country. — The country is much disturbed owino- to the quarrel between the Barbaris and Taimuris. The Commander of the Troops and M. de Beauvais, when at Shaban-i-Garma, saw eight large villages entirely deserted, and fugitives from the hills came to beg for food. The Taimuris, though they say that 500 families of the tribe have been ruined, do not appear to be prepared for peace. Nishabur is very disturbed. Mashallah is plundering the neighbourhood and the Governor and the financial agent are plundering the town. The Shikari robbers, after a raid on Budkan near Chinaran, are being besieged in Khij by Kar- balai Husain of Daulatabad, whose men are robbing the caravanserias on the Gulmakan road. Cart-drivers, being Russian subjects, have presented a formal petition to my Colleague to complain of the insecurity of the roads. One of them, Nasrullah, has been attacked at Kudamgar near Nishabur. The robbers took from him five horses, 70 tumans in cash and a parcel worth 200 tumans. Mirza Hussain Khan, Governor of Bulukat, has been attacked by 30 Shikari robbers, who killed three of his men and captured a fourth. The post and travellers have been robbed at Hauz-i-Ghulam between Sabza- war and Nishabur. T. W.

He found an Afghan party of 11 sowars under Duffedar Yasin Khan at Yazdan on the 9th September 1915. They told him they were there because they could not get supplies on their own side of the border ! They had been there about 12 days. They left quietly on the arrival of 18 Persian sarhazes. On the 12th September Munshi Rahmat Ali crossed Herr Paschen and 5 sowars near Karez-i-Malki returning to Afghanistan. There was about a mile between them, fortunately for the Indian Munshi! The Munshi was told next day that the German had been persuaded by Ali Akbar, Tehvildar, not to continue his journey to Ispahan as the whole road was blocked by Russians and British and even the Governor would help to arrest him. Paschen has been buying stocks of grain and leaving them in the villages. From two other news-reporters I learn that about a dozen Afghans have been similarly purchasing. A few villagers in Sunni Khana have refused to sell out of fear of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The Persian Sunnis are notoriously anxious that the Germans and Afghans should not pass through their district, as they fear that the Shiahs will seize the excuse afterwards to punish them. September 16th. —I hear that Captain Thorbum, I. M. S., Agency Surgeon, Meshed, has started with 1 Hazara officer and 79 rank and file for Birjand. A second detachment with 19 more men will follow, it is hoped, about the middle of October. The Sistan Column. September 16th. —News is received from Khusp that a sentry of a small post at Dastgird shot dead about midnight a local levy placed at the disposal of the Military by the Consulate. The unfortunate man, according to the sentry’s and a Hazara sepoy’s statements, gave no reply to challenges. He was sent forward from another post by a non-commissioned officer who could not have instructed him how to act. The Karguzar has written to me alleging that the sentry was awakened at his post by the messenger ! The Situation in Sistan. September 27^.—Sardar Taj Muhammad, Reki, has passed through Lutak on his return journey to Sarhad without interviewing either the Deputy Governor or His Majesty’s Vice-Consul. At Deh Khalikdad near Lutak, he carried off three men of a tent-dwelling tribe alleging that they were runaway slaves. F. B.

A Peshawar mistri employed in Amir’s powder factory who left Kabul on Tuesday last arrived at (Peshawar ?) to-day. He is exceptionally intelli gent man. He reports that a party of Germans, Austrians, Persians and Turks, all of whom were armed, arrived at Kabul about 10 days ago with one field gun drawn by 10 horses. Twenty of the party wore European clothes, the remaining 200 Turks, Pathacs and Persians were dressed in oriental garb. Pour out of the 20 dressed in European clothes are leaders. Party was, on arrival at Kabul, accommodated at Babar Bagh where officials sent from Paghman made arrangements for them. The party was at once joined at Bahar by Sardars Inayatulla Khan and Nasrulla Khan who came from Paghman and they have remained 'with them ever since. The four leaders have not moved out of a house in Bahar Bagh where they have most of the time been closeted with Inayatulla and have also frequently been visited by Nasrulla Khan. Correspondence passes between Sardars and the Amir, who is at Ozai Kas, five miles beyond Paghman. The 20 in European dress do not leave Babar Bagh but the native members of the party go about the country freely and talk. The latter say four leaders are high German Austrian an/Turkish officials with letters from their sovereigns demanding alliance or at least free passage for an Army. Those who came before and who are still interned in I)eh Afghanan, are in no way connected with this . party.D.-o., No. 1115 C., dated Parachinar, the 2nd October 1915.

Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. 7 Please refer to my cipher telegram* of b&gt;day. In addition to the information contained * No. 110 K., dated the 2nd October 1915. therein my informant gave me the following Kabul news and gossip which I did not consider it necessary to include in my telegram. The cholera in Kabul broke out two days after the Id-ul-Fitr, i e„ about the 16 th of August, it was very bad indeed and there was hardly a house in Kabul that had not a death in it. The Amir fled to Paghman at once and, as a great many people followed him, he put guards on the roads and went on himself further into the hills. Sardar Nasrulla Khan and Inayatulla Khan stayed in Kabul for some time after the Amir, but eventually joined him. Now there is nobody in Kabul except the Kotwal and his staff, the workmen at the Amir’s factories who have been detained by force and troops to guard the factories, storehouses and palaces. Those of the population who have not fled to great distances are living in the villages round Kabul where cholera still continues but in a less severe form. My informant's uncle is the head of one of the departments of the Amir's factories and gets Its. 160 (British) a month, he has now 250 men working under him, the number having been increased by 50 quite recently. A considerable proportion of these men are from India, they are occupied in making smokeless powder, previously they used to do task-work and to be paid by results, but lately they are forced to work ten to twelve hours a day and have soldiers stationed through the factories to see that they do not leave. The machines in the neighbouring factories which turn out cartridges cases are working at high pressure. My informant does not think that there has been much leakage recently from the arsenals or he would have heard of it. Kabul gossip is to the effect that Sardar Nasrulla Khan recently asked the Amir to increase the pay of the sepoys from twelve rupees Kabuli to fifteen, that the Amir refused and that Nasrulla Khan let this be known with the result that the Amir is now very unpopular with the army, that a number of military officers in Kabul sent a deputation to inform the Sipah Salar that the army were determined on jehad and that if the Amir would not lead them they would find somebody who would. It is not known whether this was reported to the Amir. Food is very dear in Kabul and the troops are discontented and are talking openly of the Amir's deposition. It is said that on receipt of letters from the Germans and Turks the Amir recently asked the advice of the Sipah Salar who advised him to reply that he would remain neutral in the war and would oppose any force which tried to enter Afghanistan. The Amir was pleased with this reply but the Sipah Salar's advice was strongly opposed by Nasrulla Khan and Inayatulla Khan of whom the latter is said to be even more strongly in favour of war than the former. It is believed in Kabul that the Germans have come to ask the Amir for an alliance if possible and failing that for a free passage of an army which is said to be ready in the Caucasus and for which they have already arranged a passage through Persia. Little is known in Kabul of the disturbances in the Mohmand country and in Swat, but it is openly said that Nasrulla Khan has sent Mullas to stir up trouble amongst the tribes. My informant struck me as an , exceptionally intelligent man and appeared to be speaking the truth as far as he knew it.*XJ Translation of a letter from His Majesty tbe Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, No. 215, dated the 27th Shawal 1333 Hijra, corresponding to the 8th September 1915.

Doubtless he is conveying despatches to Ispahan. Two parties of our cavalry have been sent out to intercept him, but they will not go more than 40 miles from Birjand in view of yesterday's warning from Tehran about critical nature of situation. I intercepted a letter yesterday to Shaukat-ul-Mulk from Imad-ul-Mulk which was written from Duhuk. It is reported by latter that Russians are quiet at Tabas and that there is no news of Germans.

German party in Herat. Please refer to my telegram No. 1 F. of the 3rd instant. The party was on 3rd instant still at Bagh-i-Shah but had been warned to be ready to proceed on the 5th instant to Kabul. Places of interest and shrines have been visited by the Germans under escort and it is said that they have made plans but as they were not allowed to take photographs this may be doubted. When received in durbar by Governor the Germans exhibited a map and proclamation of jehad issued by Shiahs and Sunni Mullas and the Sultan of Turkey and they promised assistance in the form of officers, troops and arms assuring the Governor that Germany was prepared in return j for her help to insist on the cession of Turkistan as far as Samarkand to j Afghanistan and (of India ?) as far as Bombay. Very little impression seems to have been made by these promises. Not much has been done by the Germans to make themselves popular and by many they are owing to information circulated in our interests regarded as fugitives. Their criticisms of the armaments and troops of Afghanistan was not acceptable and the commander of troops has declined to allow them to inspect the troops or to receive a visit from them. They are well guarded, the Turks were refused permission to recite Khutba and the party are not permitted to have free intercourse with the populace. Unfortunately four or five of them have been permitted by the Governor to return (see my telegram 21 F., dated Birjaud, the 9th instant) and he has also permitted a small party of stragglers who were detained at frontier to join them in Herat, but on the other hand he has pending the receipt of orders from His Majesty the Amir detained at the frontier a body of horse said to be about 200 strong and professing to be Turks. The first party’s movements were it seems very likely known to the Gov ernor, but in order that he might lay the blame on the commander of the troops he took no steps in the matter while for having stopped the body of men now on the border he will take all the credit.

De In Birjand, our one British banking and trading firm are doing no business and on account of the general financial stringency find it difficult even to collect their large outstandings.

[140220] No. 1. Mr, Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received September 28.) (No. 111.) Sir, Tehran, September 1, 1015. MUCH as it has been talked of, the definite resignation of Ain-ed-DowLek’s Cabinet on the Oth July came as a slight surprise to most people, as he had been apparently making a stronger stand against the Democratic attacks on Farman Farma for two or three days previously. Nor am I quite certain even now, a month after the event, exactly what his reasons were, but the general opinion is that his Highness, being one of those who do not believe in the existence of two kings in Brentford, hoped that by sacrificing Farman Farma he would be brought back to office by the grateful Democrat. During his short tenure of office Ain-ed-Dowleh seems to have endeavoured to do what Hussein Hilmi Pasha and other Grand Viziers failed to do with the Committee of Union and Progress in Turkey, i.e., bend the Democrats to his will; but, like the Turkish statesmen, he eventually discovered that if he was to retain office it must be as servant, not as master. All the time he was professing to the Russian Minister and myself his earnest desire to serve our interests, which he always admitted were identical with those of Persia, but always failed—out of fear of offending the pro-German Democrats—to give practical effect to his professions until just before the fall of his Cabinet, when he permitted the arrest of an obscure German agent proceeding to Meshed. M. de Etter and I called on his Highness on the morning after his resignation and give him to understand that if he wished to resume office without Farman Farma he could no longer count on the financial support which the two Powers were ready to afford him. Farman Farma had been attacked because, in virtue of his office, he had been the instrument of such mild measures as the Cabinet had taken to check German intrigues, and if his Highness now sacrificed him to Democrats—i.e., German clamour —our Government could only regard it as a German victory and Ain-ed-Dowleh as an instrument in the hands of the pro-German party. Having demolished Ain-ed-Dowlehs Cabinet, the Democrats had to find a substitute. I need not weary you with the list of their futile efforts, but it will be enough to say that at his second attempt Mustofi-ul-Mamalek succeeded on the 19th August in presenting to the Medjliss as heterogeneous a Ministry as e\ei sat at the same Council table. Mustofi himself represents the Democrats—not that he is one at heart, but because he cherishes the fantastic belief that if Russia would consent to remove her troops from Kasvin and elsewhere in Persia, public opinion would pass from bitter hatred to warm affection for the northern neighbour. He can therefore be trusted to keep open the sore between Persia and Russia. Vossugh-ed-Dowleh an Sipahdar, on the other hand, are considered to be nothing but Russian agents, wmle Ala-es-Sultaneh represents Great Britain, and the presence of these three is to secure our tolerance, if not our support, of the combination. With Muin-el-Vezarek as his “chef de cabinet,” Motesham-es-Sultaneh can be trusted not to compromise tie Government with us, while Assadullah Khan seems to have been thrown m o strengthen the “ English ” element in virtue solely of his knowledge of the language. The others scarcely count. , „ , . , ^ i ,i The Russian Minister and I have, of course, been accused of having prolonged the crisis, but the accusation is unjust, for the simple and obvious reason that our interests would have been better suited by the installation of any Cabinet except a 1 ank y democratic and pro-German one, and that, as events showed the Democrats covdd not achieve. On two occasions we made endeavours to induce the Shah to use hisintluence a„d terminate the crisis, but His Majesty was too much under the influence of his German-paid entourage—it is alleged that he himself has not be ® a , i | inducements of this character - to listen, and 1 have some reason to think that His Majesty’s eyes were only opened to the “ German peril by the insolent behaviom ot the German consul at Kermanshah (see my despatch No. 110). Meantime we have succeeded, thanks to the influence of the better-informed press, m creating a body of opinion among the more educated and substantial classes strongly opposed to t e [2474 ee—6]2 fatuous tolerance which the Persian Government has up till now exhibit a Germans and their intrigues. ?fiibited to the Unfortunately, however, during the seven weeks in which the eountrv a Government the enemy has had a free hand, and has made thtnuost German chief centre is at Ispahan.

The position of a local Governor was thus difficult. He was, like everyone else, much impressed by the reports assiduously spread by the Germans of crushing defeats to Russia, and he felt that to oppose the Germans was to run counter to the artificially raised sentiments of the populace, and he hesitated to risk an encounter without the most explicit orders from the Government. By the beginning of August, however, a slight change for the better took place. The appearance of the Cossacks in Kain and JSeistan, and the advance of our own column from Baluchistan, and a little later the occupation of Bushire, woke Persia up to the imminent danger into which party struggles bad led her, and it was then possible (by the help of proper inducements) to get instructions sent through Suleiman Khan, the ultra-Democratic Secretary-General of the Minister of Interior, to Seistan, Kerman, and Ispahan, and occasionally warnings to Shiraz. Even so, these instructions were often scarcely better than the traditional order “to maintain neutrality,” i.e., do nothing, and when a more categorical message was sent it was not infrequently cancelled by a subsequent secret telegram. I do not, however, believe that this partial change of attitude was due to any fear of future chastisement on the part of the two Powers. The impression created by the Russian retreat in Poland was too deep, and it was rather from the consciousness that German intrigues had been allowed to go too far, and from fear that unless checked at once Persia would relapse into anarchy. The same apprehension forced even the Democrats to recognise that a Government of some kind must be formed, and as they recognised that a purely Democrat Ministry, even if accepted by the Medjliss, could not stand for a week, they left Mustofi a free hand to get support where he could. Mustofi-ul-Mamalek means well, and he is reputed, and I believe rightly, to be absolutely clean-handed, but while he is aware of the dangerous position to which his friends have brought the country, he is also appalled by the difficulty of surmounting it. His proper course would be to assemble a reliable force composed of the Cossack Brigade and Bakhtiari sowars to Tehran and then close the Medjliss and suppress the pro-German press. But he hesitates to incur the wrath of his quondam friends the Democrats by employing what are regarded as being respectively Russian and British forces, and still more to be frank with the Russian Minister and myself and work honestly with us in interests which are, as he admits, more Persian than foreign. Instead of that he is trying to “ squeeze ” us in order to be able to conciliate the Democrats and their kind by showing that he has wrung concessions from us. buch a policy, which is entirely to the taste of so weak a character as Persia s present Prime Minister, can only fail, and our present endeavour is to get what we can out ot the Cabinet before it falls.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I am informed by llussian Vice-Consul that Cossacbs are stationed at Tabas, Kain and Tun, but that he is not aware of their strength. The main body is still at Turbat-i-Haidari, I suppose. Colonel Gushchin has declined to send Cossacks to Khur. Both Colonel Haig and myself have heard that in vicinity of Tabas two or three Germans are lurking, who are still holding communication with west and Afghanistan. I am informed that some of the Germans who joined mission into Afghanistan came by Naiband route. The road to Tabas from Naiband is quite open to Germans at present. The road to Sistan from NaibaAd is via Garmab Sarichah (see map Volumes one and four, “ Routes in Persia ”). Colonel Hale has received orders from Colonel 'VVikeley to advance to Khusp from Neh. I shall meet Hale at Khusp. In your opinion is it necessary that any special (arrangements ?) should be made to cut German communication between Tabas and Naiband ? If so, orders should be sent to Colonel Gushchin through Russian Legation at Tehran to arrange with Colonel Hale. For their support of Germans I would like to see Imad-ul-Mulk and his son Imad-ul-Mamalik receive severe punish ment, but I do not know if it is possible to punish them with force which we have at our disposal. It is not difficult, I understand, to block all roads leading to the town of Naiband, although place itself cannot be reduced (without ?) a field gun. We ought also to put a stop to caravans taken supplies to Naiband from Kainat. In regard to this can we ignore objections of local authorities? Shaukat-ui-Mulk naively said to me 10 days ago that be was in correspondence with Imad-ul-Mulk and that latter would certainly let him know about any more German parties which might intend to enter Kainat region. At the first sign of trouble all the Governor's sowars who accompanied Mr. Hormer to Naiband disappeared and never came back to his assistance.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to my telegram No. 313. His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, describes situation as of a very disquieting nature and advocates the departure before it is too late of at least the women and children. Reports received from Russian Consul is equally alarmin'. Both of them describe populace as in a state of ferment due to the occupation of Bushire by us but excitement against us is fictitious and Germans would have invented another cause if cause alleged did not exist. Russian Minister and I are of opinion that for our colonies and Consuls to stay any longer would be a useless risk. It is of course true that by with drawing them we are playing German game, but Germans will renew their attempts at murder if they remain, thus bringing about their object. In spite57 of risks I should be disposed to hold on if any action whatever could be tak by Government here, but even if they are attempting to act which I ;irn } eT l inclined to doubt, they cannot really do anything.

As long as Cabinet remained passive, Persia believed that it approved of the German propaganda against two Powers. ■With regard to question of Bush ire he urged strongly the withdrawal of our troops from that quarter. I replied that Prime Minister and I bad talked matter over and that I declined absolutely to recede from the arrangement offered yesterday to His Highness.

From— His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Urgent. The conversation which the Russian Minister had with His Majesty the Shah of Persia yesterday was not satisfactory. Shah seems to be somewhat under influence of enemy. Prussian Minister and 1 are of opinion after a long and careful consideration that an attempt at Ispahan following on other attrcks on our Consul(s) discloses a state of affairs that demands strong action without delay on the part of British and Itussian Governments. It is plain that object of enemy is to bring about a rupture of relations between Persian Government and the two Powers by infamies of this kind so as to enable enemies to announce union of two Islamic peoples. No action whatever is taken by Persian Government .to restrain German proceedings or even to influence public opinion against them ; Government’s one idea on the contrary is to use Germans as a means to squeeze us unless we can bring some kind of pressure to bear on them and offer them substantial inducements also. If we applied pressure in the nature of say occupation of another port, such action would defeat its own object, because it will only (provide ?) Germans with another pretext to inflame public feeling against us as in the case of Bushire. Unless numbers of Russian troops at Kasvin are very greatly augmemed say up to 15,000 men same considerations would also apply to their being used, and even if Russian troops were available there is no time for this. Only course which is left to us (is to ?) offer Persian Government the choice of declaring herself on our side or on the side of enemy. It would be insufficient to ask (?) Persia to break off relations with the enemy Powers; distinction is of too subtle a nature for the average Persian intellect to grasp and step would be so signal a one as to leave no room for doubt or half measures. If Persian Government wants to join us, she must make a declaration of war on enemy Powers and we would in that case agree to moratorium from now to be in force until say three years after the conclu sion of the war. In contrary case the British and Russian Legations would leave the country at once holding Persian Ministers responsible for safety of our Consuls and colonies on their journey, for safety of any of our nationals who wished to stay back and for safety of all British and Russian property in Persia. Persian Government would be allowed say 48 hours in which to arrive at a decision. My Russian colleague and I believe there is a chance that Persian Gov ernment would accept these terms though that Government would very likely stipulate for military assistance, for a sum of money to be paid down, for a69 guarantee of territorial integrity at end of war, and for eventual removal f,- Persia of all foreign troops: some or all of these points would be for by Persia. ymated It is a matter for Allied Powers to decide whether their interests wl * k are at stake make some such arrangement as that defined above necess’i^ desirable, but unless some very drastic measure is taken or a decisive mil if ° r success occurs to shake Persian belief in German powers invincihilitv p Minister and I are agreed that we shall not be able to remain muc«l„' S8U ? n Tehran and it at least (will?) be less damaging to prestigeoTour Seci™ Governments for us to leave Persia by our own doing than to be comn^l 1^1 do so. Belgian and French Ministers are in accord with these views ami 1 .,',/° has wired to his Government that situation is becoming critical in Persia. ^ Petro A “ es9a S 0 identical with foregoing is being sent by Russian Minister to If Persian Government declares for us, enemy missions will nrohahlv make for Ispahan, and grave disorders may ensue if they succeed tboi.T r do not think that these disorders would last very long if Persian Government had plenty of money to use among tribes. At Shiraz and Ispahan tTere would be some danger for Consul and colonies and former would have m depend on Kawam for assistance and latter on Bakhtiari Khans I ? thmk there would he much danger elsewhere.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to your telegram No. 241 regarding Bushire. Tins morning I saw the Prime Minister. I said that as anticipated by me the solution he had suggested could not be accepted by His Majesty’s Government, hut I was glad to know that a proposal practically indentical with one I now brought with me had been put forward by the Persian Minister in London. The dismissal of the Governor-General of Pars as a necessary condition of the restoration of Persian Civil authority in Bushire was agreed to by His Highness without very serious demur, hut he then boggled over the punish ment of the Khans and insisted that our troops should be withdrawn at an early date. He would not promise that further punishment should be meted out to the Tufangchis v;ho had actually taken part in attack and in regard to the Khans who were responsible for it he would give no kind of promise. As regards the troops he said they must be withdrawn in order to appease public opinion. The news of an attempt on the life of the Consul-General at Ispahan was received by me at about this point. I at once communicated the information to His Excellency and pointed out to him that the public opinion he wished to placate was that which had brought about occurrences such as this. It was the opinion aroused and paid for by German gold and to his making any concession to it I could not consent. Until ail danger was past the British troops must remain. Gendarmes w T ould, His Excellency said, be sent to which I replied that he was setting wolves to guard His Majesty’s Kepresentative and that the suggestion would not he entertained for a moment. Especially in view of the attack on the Consul-General I consider His Excel lency’s objections as tantamount to a refusal to give us any satisfaction and as an indication that there is no intention on the part of the Persian Govern* ment to carry out the policy of neutrality which they have so often proclaimed and I regret to have to telegraph to this effect to you. The attempt at Ispahan w as, I warned His Excellency, the fourth of a series of attempts on the Consular Officers of the two Powers for which no adequate satisfaction had as yet been given. It revealed a most serious situation and the Persian Government had now r to make the choice as to whether or not they w ere going to' permit the achievement by the Germans of their object of making our position here impossible. Should it he decided by His Excellency now not to give us very moderate satisfaction circumstances required that we should draw our own conclusions from his attitude, viz., that Persian Government contem plated the possibility of relations bein? broken off between Persia and her two neighbours without serious misgiving. Without consulting his Colleague H»9 Excellency said he could not give a reply.

From—The Secretary to the Goverument of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, To—His Pritannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain (repeated to His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran). Instructions are being conveyed by the military authorities to Colonel Dale to the effect that he must on no account, without definite sanction, move west of Khusp. It should be clearly understood that the object of sending troop? to Sistan is merely to counteract the influence of the Germans and, if possible, to intercept their parties where this can be dene with reason- eble hope of success ; but that there must be no idea of attacking Persian subjects who show sympathy for the Germans or Persian towns. By such action a situation might arise with which our force would be quite i nadequate to deal. At Tehran the situation is very critical, and if relations are broken off with the Persian Government, the question of our future action in Sistan will have to be very carefully considered. No action should there fore in meantime be taken which is at all likely to provoke genral hostility. Telegram P., dated the 175 6th (received 7th) September 1915.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Denari, ment, Simla. Clear the line. Urgent. Please refer to telegram from Government of India No. 912 S., dated 6th September. My Russian colleague and I have had in mind constantly the importance which Afghan and Indian consider ations possess in relation to the Persian problem and the proposals we thought out were framed entirely with a view to hold up situation in Persia. That there is no small element of chance involved m proposal must be readily admitted but bow policy of drift which Government of India advocates can meet the difficulty I entirely fail to see. Every day the Germans are strengthening their position here and by employing same methods as those which they have resorted to at Ispahan, could even now render our position impossible. The question therefore is not one of drifting but of how lom&gt;' our enemies will stay their hand and it is scarcely to be hoped that Germans will wait for the occurrence of some signal success to alter position such as forcino 1 of Dardanelles. What would be much more to the purpose would be the capture of Baghdad in my opinion. An alternative course lies open to us, but it seems to me to labour under same disadvantages as to the policy of drift which has been su^ested. That course would be for us to inform Government of Persia that we are prepared to give them support which they are always hinting at, viz., arms and money or in other words to confess to surrender on our part and allow ourselves to be blackmailed mercilessly. We should ask Persian Government in return to close'the Mejlis, suppress hostilities, newspapers, &amp;c., and at first sign of such action on part of Persian Government, Germans would strike their blow. That Persian Gov ernment will go to considerable lengths to prevent the British and Russian Legations from leaving Tehran is (as a) matter of fact only element of present situation in our favour. Germans are endeavouring to overcome even this reluctance and two inopportune incidents have just^taken place which are calculated to assist German policy as they will give Germans further ground for exciting Persian opinion. The first of these incidents is the landing to-day at Enzeli of a Russian regiment, a force which is insufficient to command respect but whose advent is provocative. The second incident is the intentional deportation of Turkish Consul-General, Resht, but Russian Mimster teUs me lie will use his efforts to get orders sent from Caucasus. Indian Government consider our proposal involves playing game which Germany wants; on the contrary we see game is already in hands of Germans and we believe in the course which we suggest, by‘utilizing onlv element of situation that is favourable and promising financial assistance at same time and other inducements (ior?j pulling chestnuts out of the fire which we have offered to Persia. Chance of its being a success is but a small one, for I can scarcely believe when moment comes so flabby Minister as Miustaufl would find courage put bis name to a declaration of war against Germany, to say nothing of Turkey, in spite of halt hints from Persian Government that they would at a price become our allies. At the present moment disposition of Persian Government awb* U Ai? ay be S ? U p d by fact that 1 have j ust received from Minister for iorei n Attairs verbal message that Persian Government reject our proposal insist on bn, S e r re &lt; l u ® stlon ’ aud P ri o r to recall (of) Governor-General, b'ars, insist on hoisting ot Persian flag at Buslnre. &gt; % ¥ -o8 64 If, however, our respective Governments decide against our proposals, I submit that we should at least try to induce Persian Government by giving them assistance in money and arms which they ask for rather than adopt a policy of drift and an ever (increase Pjing drift. Sooner or later this will of course involve settlement of Bushire question on Persian terms, but it offers a slight chance on the other hand of inducing Persian Government not to tacitly encourage pro-German feeling in country. It may however just as well have a contrary effect as it will show Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government are wholly dependent on goodwill of Persia. Initial money inducement will have to he large, and will he necessarily- limited by power (to) Imperial Bank of Persia to make advance. Advance must also be given immediately and without waiting for concurrence of Kussian Government. Addressed to Foreign Office; sent to Government of India, Sir P.

Facts have become known to me which show that Persian Government h not sincere in its dealings with us. Knowing that I feel anxious about the safety of British Consul and community at Shiraz, they are trying to use it as a means to induce us to evacuate Bushire. Position of Consul becomes still more dangerous by their attitude and I have sent him instructions to nrem™ to leave Shiraz. y P The Bakhtiari are professing at Ispahan and Tehran that without orders from Government they cannot bring sowars, and Prime Minister will try to make these orders conditional on our evacuation of Bushire. Of course Khans are taking advantage of this opportunity to squeeze money out of us.

These two were well received and were lodged at Baghishah where two Captains and an Infantry guard have been put in charge of them. Balance of this party was expected from Farah and escort was sent out by Governor with ponies for their baggage and with provisions for party. Our Newswriter at Herat suspects Governor of playing a double game j it is reported by him that visitors were received by the people with some enthusiasm, but I think that for the present party will be interned and that Amir’s orders will be obeyed by the Governor.

Russian Minister has sent a wire to Petrograd which is couched in very pessimistic terms. He is of opinion, ia which I largely concur, that Germans with their Mujtabids, and gendarmerie aie virtually masters in some of principal towns of Persia, viz., Shiraz, Jvermanshah and Ispahan, and that Germans are seeking to reproduce in Tehran itbCil these same conditions and that in other (places ?) such as Luristan antiin the south of Persia anarchists hold sway. He is also of opinion that German plan is to undermine authority of Persian Government to point when it will be incapable of maintaining a semblance of order, to render position of our Consuls, &amp;c., in Persia so precarious that they will have to be withdrawn and finally that plan aims at expelling legation itself from Tehran.

I would invite your attention to Tehran telegram 298 addressed to Foreign Office. For Consul to leave Shiraz or to make preparations to do so would, I respectfully submit, be a great mistake. He is not alone there. At Shiraz there is also a British community which includes ladies and children if I am not mistaken. If our people did leave Shiraz where, except to Ispahan, could they go ? Surely by remaining in Consulate under guard they run less risk. Enemy’s objective is Busbire. To judge from reports of Consul at Shiraz there does not appear to be any lively reason to expect trouble there. Kawam will probably assist Consul. Governor-General would probably not allow Consul or British Community to be harmed for sake of bis own skin. The withdrawal of our Consul from Shiraz would have worst effect possible on situation generally. I venture to suggest that Governor-General should be warned that he himself will suffer personally should any harm come to any of our people.

For the last few days Germans have been endeavouring to rouse feeling of populace here against ourselves and the Russians by preaching in the streets and distributing leaflets shaking(?) the friendship of Persia towards us. But little has been done by the Police to prevent it and the gendarmerie are nearly openly hostile. The object of the Germans would seem to be to make hazardous an advance of Russian troops from Kasvin. Great excitement has been caused at Shiraz by the occupation of Bushire and by other operations and the Consul there describes the situation as being critical. The Clergy are agitating in Ispahan, hut the Bakhtiaris are keeping aloof from the movement. German Consul at Kermanshah has threatened to stop by force the return of Russian and British Consuls.

This morning I received definite information that a German caravan con sisting of 11 camels carrying barley and flour left Khur for Naiband on night of August 15th. Six Persian sowars escorted it. It is believed by my Ptussian Colleague that next day one German with 3 servants followed, but I am of opinion that these probably overtook the party going across Afghan frontier. Twenty Cossacks are sick out of the 60 who were here and 25 have just gone to Seb with a telephone. For Khur none were considered available and Itussian troops are forbidden to operate south of Birjand and that place. I am sending to-night under Mr. Dormer a party of 30 sowars, which includes 8 Indians of my escort, with 2 Duffadars all riding on camels to Garmab and possibly to Naiband to obtain information and to seize German supplies if possible. Ten sowars are being sent by the Governor-General with the party to act as messengers and guides. As in the case of those who accompanied Russian Vice-Consul to Afghan frontier they are forbidden to fight. The party is being accompanied as far as (Khusp ?) by seven Cossacks. For several days Monsieur Samsonoff has been urging Colonel Gushchin to send to Khur 100 Cossacks. I beg that His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed will, if possible, use his influence to this end.

I mildly remonstrated with His Excellency on August 17th for sending men to Khur without inviting my co-operation {vide my telegram 12 E.). His reply was to effect that orders he received from Minister of Interior are still to be neutral and he will not fight Germans, vide my diary No. 31. He cares nothing for orders of Persian Foreign Minister which were conveyed through Karguzar at Meshed to him. He is only subordinate to Minister of M ar and Minister of Interior. For their behaviour at Kain he hates the Russian and if he orders his troops to co-operate with them he will gain unpopularity.

He was formerly£9 in the service of German Legation, which according to his statement he left after having had a quarrel with Hentig. In his attitude to us we have always found Seyyid Mohsin of an extremelv friendly disposition and he is a sensible man hut his subordinates at Kain and other places have lately behaved in manner which is very suspicious. It seems possible that Pugin, who visited Birjand in April 1914, through his friendship with Heynsens got him appointed here. Russian Consul thinks that Seyyid Mohsin is still in the pay of Germans.

It has come to my knowledge that the conversation carried on by the Governor in the Telegraph Office was with his Deputy in Sistan and not with authorities in Tehran. Governor was informed by Deputy that there is no cause for uneasiness as Taj Mohamed has come only to buy sheep.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistant and Kain, To Ihe Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Mr. ^ew and Mr. Hale came back to Birjand on August 12th. Th following is a reliable account of event at Kain. Before dawn of July 30th eighty Russian cossacks arrived there. Ten o them were sent in advance up to the city gates under the guidance of ttoGoyernor s estate agent, who had been arrested some 16 miles out of the city by Cossacks on suspicion ot being a spy. This party was shot at by the Germans and two Cossacks were wounded. The estate agent was also wounded mortally. It was suspected that he had behaved treacherously and he was shot through the back, possibly by the Cossacks. Governor’s camel attendant had been sleeping all night outside the city gates against advice given him by Germans, and when the Russians arrived he vainly shouted to be allowed to come in. Probably this man was shot by Russians also. J For about an hour Cossacks then exchanged shots with the Germans and then retired to a tower some two miles outside town and as the day advanced fell back to a village four miles away. At day-break the German party left Kain. Until they received message in the evening to follow to Behad, four Bakhtiari sowars and the 25 mules with Arab muleteers remained behind. I Until noon of July 31st Russians did not make any attempt to advance against the town again. It came as a surprise to them to find that German party had escaped through southern gates of (the) Kain. The gardens of Kain embrace a large area and to guard ail the exits would require a cordon of pickets about 10 miles in length. I Russians having then taken up their lodgings in a mosque commenced to search houses of inhabitants for German loads and for arms. A contingent of Cossacks arrived under a more senior officer on 2nd August and examination of houses was resumed. The rifles which were taken from Revenue sowars were given back to their owners again. Transport was being collected for captured loads on 3rd August. Before mules were produced a number of people had to be beaten. The whole party of Cossacks left on 4th August, one division following German party up to Tun( ?), the other making their way towards Turbat-i- Haidari with the transport which included all the rifles found on Persians in town. It is alleged local Ghulam of the Russian Telegraph Office was the chief source of mischief. Not only did he lead the Cossacks into the dwellings of innocent people and do a little pillaging on his own account but he also freely demanded blackmail from others who paid up in order to avoid having their homes searched. Monsieur Samsonoff has promised to have this man severely dealt wdth. Samsonoff paid the sum of eleven tomans as compensation to a spy from this Consulate who had been arrested by Cossacks on suspicion and had been robbed of his watch and money. The owners of rifles have been given to understand that their rifles will be returned to them in Meshed if legitimate ownership can be proved. Besides arms and ammunition, I hear that German loads included Tosbakhana articles, such as swords and abas. It seemed as if some of the boxes contained bombs. They were all marked with star and crescent of Turkey. 4 80 Telegram P., No. 179 C., dated (and received) the 14th August 1915.

Please refer to your telegram 807 S., of the 11th August. Germans drove away my first spies in Kain. The Cossacks arrested my later man. The telephone line is m such a bad way that, as my Russian colleague says, no one but the line Gbulams can make any use of it. The Ghulam at Kain, who is referred to in my telegram No. 8 1., was more profitably engaged than in telegraph w'ork. As a consequence even the Russian Vice-Consul here was kept almost in the dark in regard to events that were taking place. From a Persian source I have heard that the Russian Vice-Consul advised the commander of the Cossacks to vacate the mosque, and that Cossack Com mander declined to return to the telephone. Officer in command of Cossacks27 also only telegraphed his reports to Meshed to his senior military officer. Thi no doubt accounts for proposal of Russian Vice-Consul to make a trip to Kaj 8 and his request that either I or British Vice-Consul should accompany him on his journey. Afterwards when my Russian colleague refused to make the journey on the ground that a Russian Consular officer was coming from Meshed’, I felt that I apart from the fact that the Persians had been told that Mr. New was goin» ^ with Russian Vice-Consul to Kain, I had a good reason for sending Mr. °New there to collect information.

I have been informed by His M ajesty’s Minister at Tehran that Russiai* Government have no objection to our sending armed Hazaras to Birjand from Meshed. I believe there are in the neighbourhood of Tabas 300 or 400 Persian sowars with two or th?ee dozen Germans and Austrians and several machine guns. On account of presence of Russian troops these will probably not come near Birjand but only alternative open to them would appear to be to return to Ispahan or proceed in a southern direction to Sistan (and) Sarhad via Naib^nd. Since August 3rd Consul-General, Ispahan, has mentioned that seven parties comprising 12 Germans and 61 Austrians have set out down road (to) Shiraz since July !|.9th. These are mostly believed to have turned off intq an easterly direction. If these Europeans succeed in getting into Sarhad, I think they will be able to do a great deal of harm; the addition to our force in Sistan of a hundred Hazaras may be most valuable in the forthcoming winter. Colonel Haig is prepared to allow Captain Thorburn to bring down the Hazaras to Birjand and as soon as it becomes evident that Germans have abandoned their intention of coming here I can take them on to Sistan. It is thirteen stages between Meshed and Birjand and now the road is quite open to traffic. At the present time I have 28 camel riders from Sistan and eighteen from Birjand are here in temporary service. In a few days I hope to be able to discharge these men but am awaiting news of some engagement between eimans and Russians. If I cannot have the Hazaras, whom I would much pre er, I propose to keep these levies on if the Germans continue to threaten 4&gt;Ujand and the road is strongly intrenched by them. .'Telegram P., No. 10 F., dated the 16th (received 17th) August 1915.

According to him very few Kainis are in possession of rifles and he points out that, when he requires contingents to oppose Sarhaddis, it is necessary for him to arm them himself. He promised to lend me 25 rifles on July 21st; but apparently he does not intend to carry out his promise. He has prevented me from enlisting men at Khur and Mud by enrolling them in his own service. Our Indian contractor, on July 24th, arranged in the bazar to buy 50 rifles. Just before the bargain was concluded, Governor seized rifles himself. It may be that it is the intention of Governor to honestly and simply prevent conflict between Germans and ourselves. He has been much distressed at the news from Sistan that on July 24th our troops had entered Persia and that Cossacks from direction of Turbat- i-Haidari were approaching. He sent word yesterday to tell me that he would pledge himself to protect both Consulates from Germans if I stopped further advance of our troops. I believe that, against Governor’s wishes no Kaini j tribesmen will help me.

Please refer to Foreign and Political Department telegram§ 721 S. of 26th July. In Kainat I think very few malcontents will join Germans. There is only one warlike tribe which is thoroughly obedient to Governor. Remaining population would be a source of weakness to whichever side engaged them, as they have been cowed by Baluch raiders. Governor is most anxious to keep Cossacks out of his province. There is a faint chance that he will send (?) his troops to arrest Germans or drive them northward. I however have a poor opinion of fighting qualities of his force and if Germans managed to get the upper hand of them and came to Birjand, Russians would certainly I have to follow. We have ladies, Hindus and bank here. If our troops do not co-operate as quickly as possible, we shall lose much prestige. It occurs to me that we can try to enlist Sarhaddis on our side if Governor fails us. Their leaders have already expressed wish to visit Officer Commanding, Robat. It would be necessary to oli’er them a big subsidy but they could probably supply one thousand men with which number in conjunction with our troops we could overrun Sistan and Kainat and by this course we would nullify attempts of Germans to seduce them. There are no armed parties of Germans making for Kacha or Sarhad at present so far as I understand, but later on 200 Bakhtiari sowars in service of Governor-General at Bam may possibly prove hostile to us. It is a point not to be lost sight of that they have hitherto been opposed to Sarhaddis.

O.—A, dated Simla, the 30th July 1915, From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To—-His Majesty the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. * Jfter compliments.-—In my letter No. 15, dated the 25th July, corre sponding to 12th Ramzan 1333 Hijra, I gave Your Majesty such further information in regard to the moyements of the German agents now in Persia as had then come to my knowledge. Since then I have received reports from my Consular officers in Eastern Persia showing that one of the parties, consisting of four Germans, with some 80 sowars and machine guns, have actually reached Kain. The German in command of this party intimated that he had come as Consul, although he had no credentials whatever and no intimation of this had been made by the Persian Government to their local officers; and, further, this German declared that he intended to post German Consuls to Sistan, Birjand and Herat. The Governor of the Kainat sent a message to this party protesting against their moving with armed escorts through his Province, and he has referred the matter to his Gov ernment. Whether or not the Persian Government will issue stringent orders on the subject I cannot say, but, in view of their generally supine attitude, due to constant Cabinet changes and to German intrigue at Tehran, and the fact that their local officers have no adequate forces to deal with such a situation, His Majesty’s Government have decided, in consultation with the Russian Government, that we must take definite steps ourselves in this matter, both in our own interests and in the interests of Your Majesty. It has been arranged, therefore, that the Russians should despatch about 1,000 troops from the north to intercept these parties, if possible, and prevent them entering the vicinity of Meshed, where Russian interests are considerable, or proceeding by that route to Your Majesty’s territories. The Government of India, on the other hand, have decided to despatch a small force now at Robat, near the Persian frontier, to Nasratabad, in order to check the spread of German intrigue in Sistan, where the influence and interests of the Government of India are predominant, and also to prevent any German parties from reaching Afghanistan by this route. I think it right to inform Your Majesty at once of these measures, in order that you may not be misled by any wild stories which may reach Kabul of Russian and British forces operating in Persia. The forces employed, as I have already stated, will be small and only sufficient for the purpose of supporting the local Persian authorities against these mischievous intruders. As the distances in Eastern Persia are very great, it would he practically impossible for either the British or the Russian forces to reach Birjand in time to intercept the party now near there, and if these German parties adhere to this route it would probably be impossible for either the Russians or ourselves to intercept them, and I must leave it to Your Majesty to issue such orders as you may think fit for dealing with these parties, should they enter Afghanistan on that side. I have no doubt whatever that those orders will be in accord ance with the advice I have already offered Your Majesty in this matter.— Usual ending. * Amir Habibulla Khan. fieeeived an gj £ .• M 915 w Rh INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter.

I am informed by Russian Government that Governor- General, Turkistan, has just formed, under the command of a Colonel, an expeditionary force consisting of four machine guns and about 1,000 horses. Force has crossed Persian frontier and is advancing against party of Germans which is coming from Tabas. * ^ i Tn. FOBEip-r , o - a 3 a n ri Huiij I n 3 O2 It is the opinion of the Russian Government that this considerable force ■will amply suffice to intercept Germans whose numbers counted together do not amount to more than five hundred men, who are marching as much on Afghan frontier as on Meshed. In these circumstances, it appears to Russian Government that the formation of a force of 100 men by His Majestv’s Consul-General, Meshed, would be superfluous. Russian Government consider it preferable for patrol of southern portion of Perso-Afghan boundary provinces, where it would be difficult for Russian troops to arrive to be undertaken by Government of India while on the northern portion of this region Russian troops would undertake the same service.

Please see Foreign and Political Department’s telegram of July 29th, No. 746 S., to Consul-General, Meshed, I venture to submit fact of Meshed cot bein (T&gt; depleted of Bussian troops does not alter the fact that Northern Section of British sphere, namely, from Birjand to Hamun, is devoid of troops and column which has been sent from India and which is about to garrison the town of Nasratabad is considered to be regretably w eak in numbers. I hope that, in the circumstances, one hundred Hazaras may be sent as quickly as possible from Meshed to Birjand. I believe that 60 Hazaras are already available, and without such a force our prestige will suffer locally. This party in addition to 50 Afghans who are due on August 3rd will be utilised in Birjand district alone and will suffice to garrison the town, even against the whole of German forces, while the Bussians scour the country side. There is no fear of Governor betraying us, now that he has received orders to arrest Germans, though it has become quite apparent that his troops are no good for co-operating with ours in the task. Assistance of Cossacks in town is at present unnecessary. It is a most unfortunate occurence that 50 Cossacks have just arrived in Birjand from Tun and have consequently missed the first party of Germans who are retreating from Kain. At the time when w r e were8 doubtful of Governor’s attitude, Monsieur Rormnovski had pressed Russia Consul, Turbat-i-Haidari, to order 200 Cossacks to Birjand and these Cossacks have in consequence come by forced marches. As soon as they are rested, the will, I hope, leave. TB 23 Telegram P., No. 159 C., dated (and received) the 1st August 1915.

Clear line. Please refer to your telegram, No. 753 S. of 30th ultimo. The position at Birjand is (? far) more grave than in Sistan in my opinion. In Sistan the Persian authorities now-a-days never act upon their own initiative but refer to the Governor in Birjand every little question. Unfortunately Russians are detested by the Governor and particularly the present Russian I Vice-Consul. I would like to remain on near the Governor for the time being and I consider that my departure from Birjand might be misunderstood, I am separately reporting a most serious complaint about action at Kain of Russians. Such troubles are likely to be repeated. Major Heron is persona grata with all Persians in Sistan who are of importance. He has two and-a-half years’ political experience and possesses great tact. He will be able promptly to refer to me in all cases of doubt as we can generally converse on telegraph line twice a day and perhaps even use Russian’s telephone line. I believe that in Sistan at any rate for some time to come there will be no friction whatever. My going down would necessitate the withdrawal of the greater portion of Consular escort from Birjand which is undesirable for various reasons. In these circumstances I beg for a recon sideration of the orders of Government of India. I believe it would he a very good thing if the Russian \ice-Consuls at Meshed and Birjand could be exchanged. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Sistan, can only use Foreign Office Cypher Code, 1873, when telegraphing to India. I propose that, except in cases o grave emergency when he might sign his name as well as designation, 1 reports daily to me only and that I repeat in a more modern code and India. to Tehran25 Telegram P., dated (and received) the 1st August 1915.

Clew line. Urgent identical letters have been written to my Russian Colleague and mysell by Karguzar complaining against actions of two hundred Russians who arrived at Kain on the 30th ultimo. They are charged as follows:—They have quartered all their men in Juma Masjid. They have hilled one camel-drivcr, servant of Governor, who was lying asleep in gateway. They have illtreated representative of Revenue Department and have com menced house to house search for Germans. They have robbed several rifles Governor’s servants deprived various sowars of horses and all accoutrements. It is feared that antagonism through out Kainat will be created by such behaviour. Governor sent his representative to me. He particularly requested that Juma Masjid be vacated leaving for later settlement other matter. I asked Russian Vice-Consul to communicate by telephone with Officer Commanding, Kain, immediately. He agreed to do so but opined (?) that very likely Officer Commanding would not listen to him and added in his opinion Persian authorities through their own dilatoriness had brought these unpleasant results on their people. I fear adequate measures to satisfy local authorities may not be taken. I am told that the Cossacks arrested chief Mullas in Juma Masjid (?) for obstruction and sent them up to Turbat-i-Haidari. 26 Telegram P., No. 763 S., dated the 1st August 1915.

Karguzar had asked that except in the presence of representative of Governor houses be not searched. It is considered by Vice-Consul that for military reasons this is not practicable. The village of Kain is surrounded by a garden which contains detached houses and it was suspected that in them many Bakhtiaris were being sheltered and baggage hidden, I have been given by Vice-Consul an extract from his telegraphic report to Legation in which he states “ Karguzar’s arguments are of no importance at a time of military action amongst the Persians, the majority of whom with their Governors are giving German agitators a welcome '. * r lo-night the Russian Vice-Consul is requesting his Legation for permission to go to lun, thougli 1 believe that most of the Cossacks are now out in pursuit of enemy. I propose to send British Vice-Consul with him if he goes. Latter s proceeding to Tun will have a reassuring effect upon the Persian authorities, while the Russians will have a contrary impression.

No doubt the^bjeetion of h^tn GotnSntwa12 based on the assumption that I was recruiting men foi sei\ice in the Russian zone of influence. This objection is no longer valid. All that has been done by me so far is to recall some ex-soldiers who had served in the Indian Armv (supplemented by a few of their relations) for the protection in Birjand of f British interests.* The services of these men will be confined to British sphere. ~ It is a fact that originally I thought that I might require services of these men at Meshed, but that was at a time when I understood that Meshed would be without troops and that Russian Consul-General was not sending for more Cossacks. I readily acceded to the request of Prideaux, when 1 dis. covend that Cossacks were coming and I would respectfully point out that, in regard to the employment by us of ex-soldiers of the Indian Army in our zone, objection of Russian Government is inadmissible.

Though they are still very friendly with us, the Governor, Karguzar, and Finance Agent are furious with the Russians and they declare—(I) that the estate agent of Governor, who was w r ounded near Kain and has since died, was killed not by the Germans but by the Cossacks; (II) that alter his house was rifled and even his pillow ripped open; (III) that Cossacks with their horses are in mosque itself into which they have piled the (goods r) captured from the Germans and that the school adjoining mosque is a building situated lower than mosque; that the Ccssacks a]e insulting the women ; that a search has been made of the offices of Revenue Director and being in fear of his life the Revenue officer has come to Birjnnd. A request has been made by the local authorities for us to make a full enquiry. For the death of his employe the Governor says that he must have satisfaction and that if Persians under his rule are treated as enemies the whole district w r ill be in a ferment. The only alternative is, I believe, to order all Cossacks to leave the Kainat District till such time as the enemy again enter it. If Russians can with an advance post at Tabas place a coraon along the Turbat-i-Haidan Juma in Tun Duhuk and Naiband line, this province will be protects I effiectively without occupying it. The two Vice-Consuls might, alter tie Russian troops have left Kain, commence enquiries and ascertain wia irregularities were actually committed. Because Monsieur Samsonon wi reach Kain about 7th instant, Monsieur Romanovski is now apparen J unwilling to go.

On the 31st July Sardar Taj Muhammad Beqi of Sarhad arrived with a considerable following at Koh-i-Malik Siah. At our subsidised shop, his men made a few small purchases. Sardar says that he must get grain from Sistan.. I have been authorised by the Governor-General to inform the Sardar that the claims against him will be compromised for 2,000 sheep.

It is reported by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan that he has teason to believe that within a short time there will be some 300 Austrians and Germans (former being prisoners of w'ar who have however escaped from Trans-Caspia) assembled in the town of Ispahan. They are at present in camp, a short distance from outside of town limits, and possess large quantities of rifles and ammunition in addition to having a wireless telegraphy apparatus, machine guns and bombs w r ith them. They will not allow any one to approach their camp. A considerable number of Mujtahids are also in their service.Small batches of Germans are coming continually via Kermanshah route probably Oppenheim in among them. ail(l Attitude of Bakhtiari at Ispahan is exceedingly doubtful and I ha evidence that Sardar Assad, who is here, is playing a double game and probahl 6 Samsam-es-Sultaneh is doing the same. ^ aD v . South of Ispahan German parties have on more than one occasion inf f ^ rupted Indo-European Department wires and German Consul there has e ' « 4 written to Department’s officer threatening to interrupt line. This consid? able concentration of Germans and Austrians at Ispahan and acts of this ki h' obviously imply that more than a mere attack on our Consulates is intend D d and it is popularly rumoured here that German design, which is shared h democrats, is to carry off to Ispahan both Shah and Government. This is ^ far-fetched idea, but it is not improbable that hostile legations are contemplat! ing flight to Ispahan in the event of Bussian troops entering Kasvin and threatening Tehran. Three months ago idea was current topic of conversation here. Erom Ispahan with communication to Turkey open via Kermanshah .Germans would hope to throw the whole of Persia into disorder and by destruction of telegraph lines paralyse Persian Government’s action trusting to luck to involve Persia in w ar with Great Britain. The idea has also struck me that they might be threatening our position at Basrah or contemplating an attack on Anglo-Persian Company’s Oil fields. Loyalty of Bakktiaris cannot be relied on, as I have mentioned before. While at least one party Germans has gone away from Ispahan by southern road for unknown destina tion and their object may be to try and stir up tribes, Kuhgelus for example, I have also been informed by Sardar Assad in a manner that veiled a threat that he w T as trying to negotiate an alliance with Kawam and Kash^ais. Kumber of small German parties which are proceeding to Persian Gulf may indicate that attempts on their part are being made to gain over those powerful elements. Though these speculations m ay appear to be far-fetched, I can offer no better guess at reasons for Germans and (Austrians ?) coming to Ispahan. ■Whatever these reasons may be, I think that it is imperative that we should get an end put to intolerable position we are now placed in of having no responsible Government. This can only be done by appearance of Kussian troops. I hope Bussian Government will see their way to sending them with out delay. Bussian Minister entirely concurs in this opinion. In the meantime the position of Consuls at Shiraz and Ispahan is decidedly dangerous, but in the opinion of both Bussian Minister and myself, to withdraw thim and our colonies might precipitate trouble and would be interpreted as a sign of weakness. On the other hand w T e see no means of rendering effective assistance to them.

Please refer to your telegram of 1st instant. Your obtaining from Meshed a force of Hazaras cannot be approved by the Government of India, as this would involve a reference to Government of Russia whose susceptibilities on this point are tender. Moreover, measures would in all probability be ineffect ive owing to want of officers to lead Hazaras and to distance of Meshed from Birjand, and especially as it is unlikely that German parties will take this route between Russian and oui own troops. It would be remembered in regard to Russian action that in this matter they are faithfully co-operating with you and that support and cultivation of friendly relations with Russian officers is called for from you rather than criticism. 47 Telegram P., No. 169 C., dated (and received) the 5th August 1915.

Great difficulty for ready money is soon li e f he experienced.In the bank at Birjand there is only sufficient cash to defray for three months the ordinary expenses of the Consulate. In Sistan the Sistan bank are just paying out for military requirements two hundred thousand Krans which is all their cash. Ordinarily the Manager receives from Revenue and Customs Department 150 thousand Krans monthly. Now-a-days Customs receipts are low and Manager cannot buy my drafts on Tehran, if money is retained by finance agent or if revenue collecting is checked. I have been informed by the Birjmd Manager that in the Persian Gulf branches there is surplus stock and he suggests that specie be immediately brought rid Karachi and Nushki to Sistan. Sistan Manager reports that at present he can sell plenty of drafts on India up to Rs. 20,000 per mensem, provided that the Persian authorities’ rate is higher than 385 Krans per Rs. 100. Present rate of bank is 415 Krans. I hope that these suggestions will be considered by His Majesty’s Minister in consultation with the Director of Bank and that Government of India will allow me to sell to the Manager, Sistan and Birjand, at Rs. 100 per 380 Krans treasury supply bills. I consider that some specie should also be imported, as it is not safe if the condition of the country becomes more unsettled to rely on local merchants buying drafts.

Please refer to your telegram No. 46. I have constantly spoken to Persian officials in the sense of the instruc tions contained in Your Excellency’s message of June 17th. The remark which ends my telegram No. 67 of the 1st instant^was unfortunate and was due to the fact that 'when I told the Deputy Governor and the Karguzar that two Vice-Consuls were being sent to Kain, they replied that from the Russian Vice-Consul they had no hope of any satisfaction but expected a true report would be given by Mr. New. Monsieur Romanovski has never, as Your Excellency knows, exchanged even official visits with either of these Persian ' officials. I have always worked my hardest for harmony. It is, I presume, my duty to continue to submit reports of any stories for which there appears to be some foundation in truth about indiscretions of the Russians, but I shall understand that no action will, as a rule, be taken by Your Excellency on them. Possibly some representation may be made by the Finance Depart ment to you regarding the treatment meted out at Kain to their Amin Maliyeh.

Your Excellency has written as follows [His Majesty quotes the whole letter.] I have understood all this and write to say in reply that it is not and has never been the rule for the Government of Afghanistan to allow armed parties of foreigners to tour about in Afghanistan. Should the parties in question enter Afghan territory, they will be disarmed and interned till the end of the war. Notwithstanding this I have sent orders to the Governor of Herat directing him to disarm the parties in question, in case they should enter the territory of the sublime Government of Afghanistan, and send them to my presence at Kabul.— Usual conclusion. Dated 18th Ramazan 1333 Hijra, corresponding to the 31st July 1915. [ ] Seal of Siraj-ul-millat-wad-din. P.S. (In the Amir’s own handwriting.) My dear friend, After writing this letter I received Your Excellency’s letter, dated the 12th Ramzan 1333 Hijra, corresponding to the 25th July 1915. In. this Your Excellency has given detailed particulars regarding the parties in question. I, therefore, write to say in reply that Your Excellency need have no anxiety about the movements of those parties, for firstly they will not enter Afghan territory. Should they do so, please God, they can in no way interfere with the neutrality of Afghanistan, since full instructions have been issued by me. Should the parties in question enter Afghan territory, they will be disarmed at once. I assure Your Excellency and the Great British Government of the neutrality of Afghanistan during the present war. (Sd.)

Consul al Meshed communicates substance of intercepted letter from German at Tun 77 U.K. addressed to German Minister at leheran informing latter of welfare of German parties and stating that cjoutliein party lias succeeded crossing Afghan frontier and that gratifying news from K. is to be expected. Consul at Seistan telegraphs on 22nd August that Cossacks returning with Russian Vice-Consul have deiinitely ascertained that German party lias crossed Afghan frontier atChah Rig- after travelling 255 miles in seven days. Party consists of (a) six Germans including bitten, Fischer, and Frederich, (b) two or three Turks and a Mullah, (c) two “ Indian Princes ” (d) one “Kabuli Artillery Officer” named Mir Mast and five other Afghans, (e) bO Arab soldiers from Baghdad, (/) one Persian named Asghar Zadeh, late ( hief of Police at Tun, (g) 50 transport mules.

O.—A, dated Simla, the 25th From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General To—His Majesty the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. ^ After compliments.—In my letter No. 13 P. 0. of the 6th July 1915, corresponding to the 22nd Shaban 1333 Hijra, I apprised Your Majesty of the fact that a number of German agents were now in Persia attempting to stir up trouble, and that these German agents were moving in small armed parties eastwards with a view apparently to entering Afghan territory. More detailed information has since then reached me in regard to these parties and I hasten to send it on to Your Majesty, in order that you may fully understand the situation in this connection. 2. I have now ascertained that the following parties, led by German agents, are now in Persia, namely :— Party 1. At Isfahan.—Several Germans and Austrians, with an un known number of followers. Party 2. At Kerman.—Two Germans, one Bengali and 30 Persian sowars. Party 3. At Gunabad (about 150 miles north of Birjand).—Two Germans, eight Austrians, 32 Persian sowars, 12 servants, 17 camels and 16 mules (four for machine guns and 12 for arms and ammunition). Party 4. At Anarak.—Eight Germans, five Austrian, three Indians or Afghans, 39 Persian sowars, 12 servants, 12 camels, 32 mules and 17 loads of ammunition. Party 5. At Jandak.—Eight Germans or Austrians, 10 fanatics, three camels with rifles, four camels with machine guns and five camels with ammunition. Party 6. At Nain.—Nine Germans or Austrians, two Austrian soldiers, ten Caucasians, seven Persian sowars, six fanatics, and 42 mules. The total of these parties is approximately— Germans ... Austrians ... Indians ».• Persians Eanatics and Caucasians ... 29 ... 16 ... 26 ... 146 26 Total ... 243 mostly armed with rifles, and with six machine guns. The object of these parties is apparently to unite eventually somewhere near Tabas, which is about 150 miles west of Birjand. They doubtless propose thereafter, unless they are stopped by the Persian authorities or otherwise, to proceed to the border of Afghanistan in the vicinity of Gazik or Sabzawar. 3. I fully realise that, if any or all of these German parties succeed in getting through Persia and in violating Your Majesty’s territories by armed incursion, Your Majesty will be put in an embarrassing position, but I feel no doubt whatever that Your Majesty, should this occur, will deal with these German intriguers and their escort of hired assassins strictly in accordance with the rules of that neutrality which you have*o scrupulously observed. I have thought it right to give you this further detailed information regarding these German agents, without delay, in order that Your Majesty may issue such orders to your frontier officers as you may think fit, in time to anticipate this movement. I am told that wild stories are afloat in Afghanistan and among the tribes of the frontier to the effect that a Turco-German army is on the march towards India vid Afghanistan. I need not tell Your Majesty how * Amir Habibull* than,\ - &gt; absolutely ridiculous and unfounded sucli stories are, since there are Turkish forces in Persia at the present time, and no German or Austr'* 10 troops of any kind, but I would suggest to Your Majesty the advisability^ having them officially contradicted, if indeed it is true that such rumours 0t prevalent in Afghanistan, in order that the more ignorant and credulou Y r our Majesty’s subjects may not be misled into thinking that these Germ° parties, should they appear on your frontier, are the vanguard of a laro-e fn^ following. 4. I would take this opportunity of again congratulating Your Majest on the wholehearted and honourable manner in which you continue to ma tain the neutrality which, at the beginning of the war, you guaranteed a^ which not only serves the best interests of your country, but also earns for vo the gratitude of your old friend and ally, the British Government. In U former letter, in which I expressed somewhat similar sentiments, I took the opportunity of giving you my personal opinion as regards the course of the war in Europe, and I would now again reiterate the opinion that, in spite of the present set-back to Russia in the eastern theatre of the war, and in soit of the lack of very definite successes in the west, those who are best qualified to judge have no doubt whatever as to the ultimate issue of this unhappy war With the patience and determination that inspires the Allies, these nations* numbering some 314 millions (excluding India and Japan), with far superior economic resources and the command of the sea, cannot fail eventually to crush Powers with less than a third of their population and au infinitely inferior economic condition, a ruined trade and complete exclusion from the seas, however great the initial advantage of the latter may have been in military equipment and organization owing to their long and secret prepara, tion for this war. It is impossible to forecast, of course, how long this war will last, but Your Majesty may be assured that the allied nations are absolutely determined to see it through to a victorious conclusion, and that, with the advantages above mentioned, this result is eventually inevitable. 5. I shall keep Your Majesty informed of any further information which I receive with regard to these German parties in Persia, and will gladly con' sider any suggestion Your Majesty may have to make in regard to any co-operation on my part that you may think desirable in preventing them fpm violating Your Majesty’s territories.— Uaual ending.v oTo hen 1 S8nt ™ y , tel ^ , : am No - 1398 B - 1 thought that Minister’s telegram ^so. 2-3 was sum total ot his recommendations. I afterwards received his tele gram No. 247 and in view of it ventured to repeat my telegram No 1398 B to Secretary of State. Telegram V., dated the 16th (received l‘7th) July 1915. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To- His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Please refer to Marling’s telegram No. 245, dated the 13th instant. He has been told that His Majesty’s Government agree entirely and that he should in concert with you take necessary action. Telegram P., No. S. 680, dated the 17th July 1915. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London (repeated to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran; Sir Percy Cox, Basrah; and Major Trevor Bush ire). Persia. Please see Tehran telegram 247 to Foreign Office of 14th July. We concur in Marling’s opinion that time has arrived for strong action. We do not agree with Marling that seizure of Mohammerah, Lingah,°Bunder Abbas and Hormuz is desirable, but we entirely support proposal for increase of Russian garrisons in North. By the forcible occupation of Moharomerah we should estrange a valuable friend who has by his conduct deserved well of us, and possibly again excite the tribes astride the Oil Company’s pipe line. Bunder Abbas, Lingah and Hormuz present no difficulty in taking, but by their occupation we should dissipate our strength and, as has recently- occurred at Bushire, expose small garrisons to tribal attack; nor would such action be very effective. In our opinion action most suitable to take would be to assume administration of Bushire at once, take over control of Customs House, hold revenue and disallow despatch of merchandise into the interior of Persia. This action should be taken without intimation to Persian authorities, who should be left to question action of His Majesty’s Government themselves. In this way we should prove to them seriousness of intentions of His Majesty’s Government and place onus of discussion on Persian Government at same time. When questioned, British Minister at Tehran might inform Persian Government that the measures taken by us at Bushire are due to the conviction unwillingly forced upon His Majesty’s Government that the Persian Government are no longer in a position to maintain order in Bushire and its neighbourhood, and that the regrettable attack made by 300 tribesmen in which tw r o British officers were killed and several sepoys wounded and killed affords confirmation of this. Further that it is clear to His Majesty’s Government that the Persian Government are either unwilling or unable to prevent Southern Persia being made a base of hostile operations against England and her allies from the fact that the Persian Government arc permitting various armed parties of Austrians and Germans to recruit Persian sowars and to leave Ispahan and Kerman with supplies of arms and munitions. His Majesty’s Government is reluctantly compelled to take such measures as it may consider necessary for the protec tion of its ow r n interests as a situation of this kind is intolerable. But if the Persian Government are now prepared to deal effectively and seriously with matters which are constantly being brought to their notice, British Minister Beceived on 25 Aii3 «bi5 IKD1A FOREIGN SECRniALi b Letter. Ko. 80 M Bated o- jyjJ9152 will be prepared to state terms of His Majesty's Government, but not other wise. Terms to be dictated to Persian Government should be that Persian Government must within a week — (1) take definite steps to punish those Khans who were concerned in Bushire outrage; (2) for each British officer killed in outrage, pay compensation at rate of five thousand pounds, for each sepoy killed five hundred pounds, and for each sepoy wounded one hundred pounds; (3) in regard to German agents now in Persia, take definite action by having them disarmed, arrested and interned or handed over to British authorities for deportation ; (4) recall present Governor-General of Province of Pars. His Majesty's Government will not only retain Bushire, but will take such further action to safeguard her interests as the necessities of the situation may dictate, if Persian Government fail to comply with terms within time specified. In any circumstances Government of India do not propose that at present military operations should be taken outside Bushire except that Dilwar might be bombarded from sea by His Majesty’s ships. We should content ourselves with merely defensive measures and should attack be repeated trust it may be repelled effectively. While we realise that to bring home to the Persian Government the impossibility of allowing German and Austrian hostile machinations in Persia to proceed unchecked action of some kind is absolutely necessary, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that although Persia herself is impotent and a negligible quantity it will certainly become much more difficult for the Amir to maintain his position of neutrality in opposition to the warlike tendencies of his subjects if Persia should in consequence of our action declare war on Great Britain and Russia, and it must be remembered that declaration of war will probably create bitter feelings and unrest amongst our own Muhammadan subjects.

Pteinforcements will bring total to two Squadrons Cavalry, 450 Rifles Infantry and four machine guns, these should arrive by 6th August.

Repeated to Basrah, Bushire, Gorern- ment of India and Petrograd.) Urgent, Please refer to my telegram No. 247. Yesterday I obtained an audience with His Majesty the Shah and after pointing out dangerous state of affairs proved by the attack at Bushire informed him that unless a satisfactory Cabinet were formed {viz., one in which Farman Farma was included as Minister of the Interior) His Majesty’s Govern ment would be compelled to come to the conclusion that the Government of Persia w as under the influences of enemy and could not he considered as bein» determined to keep a really neutral attitude and that I should be obliged to advise that to protect their interests His Majesty’s Government should take their own measures. I added that His Majesty’s Government would be painfully impressed by the absence of any official expression of regret for the death of the tw T o officers on the part of the Government of Persia. His Majesty replied that he could not interfere in details of formation of Cabinet being a constitutional sovereign, and that there was no one who could convey Government’s regret until there was ministerial (body ?). I replied that His Majesty’s Government could scarcely w r ait quietly for reparation for recent outrage until it pleased a handful of politicians, who were in league with our enemies, to allow the Government being formed, and expressed a hope that His Majesty would use his influence immediately to end crisis. The attitude of the Shah was thoroughly unsatisfactory and the crisis may continue for an indefinite period. \ cry similar language was used by the Russian Minister to Ain-ed* Dowleh. I recommend, in these circumstances, that, provided that the two Govern ments have at their disposal the requisite forces, I be given authority to put; forward our demands and to add that, if they fail to accept them, we shall take our own measures. Our demands might be—(1) An official apology given in writing for the outrage committed. (2) The dismissal of the Governor of Shiraz and the nomination of a successor of whom we approve. (3) Punishment of tribes concerned and deposition and outlawry of their Chiefs. (4) Selection by us of the gendarmerie officers in Pars, Bushire and Kerman. (5) Wassmuss’s arrest and expulsion, recall and disarmament of all unrecognized German emissaries and agents together w r ith their followers throughout Persia, (6) Escaped Austrian prisoners of war to be interned. (7) For the murder of officers an indemnity of twenty thousand pounds. Acceptance of numbers (5) and (6) will, of course, be solely dependent upon the immediate reinforcements of Russian troops as suggested in my tele* gram mentioned above. Demand of number (2) will probably be complied with, and of others, which are intended to cover desiderata (enumerated ?) by Sir P* Cox in his telegram to the Government of India No. 1398 B. If troops (oao he ?) spared, we can ourselves exact execution.5 Depart- 4 , We shall have to be content with such measures as we can ourselves take in south if troops are not sent by Russia but on the general political position tins will have little effect no matter what the local results may turn out to be. 3th for Depart- iorern- 1 after Bushire i which rovem- tent of s being iged to Id take uld he for the ition of could ed that ion for league essed a crisis, is may Un-ed* rovern* to put J1 take or the md the tribes by us imuss’s ierman Persia, nurder icndent iy tele- d with, SirP. s (can Telegram P., dated the 16th (received 17th) July 1915.

You must judge as to this. It seems to me improbable that you can provide sufficient forces to carry out Mr. Marling’s programme and make headway against opposition which armed intervention may arouse and .this affects expediency of giving an ultimatum to Persian Government. Of getting any further troops from Egypt I see no possibility. Telegram P., No. 74, dated the 18th (received 19th) July 1915, From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to your telegram No. 680 S., dated the 17th instant. The seizure of the custom house and principal Gulf ports was suggested with the object of dispelling the view that we are near the end of our military resources, a view that has been carefully fostered by Germans, but if, as I gather, it is considered by the Government of India unwise to detach troops which would be necessary for this demonstration, we must confine ourselves perforce to lesser measures. r lhe occupation of Bushire in normal times would unquestionably have brought Persia to her senses and it is just possible may do so now, but we may find that with the strong influences of the enemy that are at work here our moderation will be interpreted as inability to do more as it will be pointed out that in view of relatively considerable force we maintain at Bushire we are virtually already in possession. No doubt it would suffice if w r e even obtained promises if not execution of reparation for the outrage recently committed, but I question if it would be sufficient to provide requisite proof of the determination of Russians and ourselves to insist on real neutrality on the part of the Persian Government. An exhibition of strength is requisite for this purpose, and if it can he done half-heartedly by us in the south it is more indispensable that in the north Russia should act in sphere where moreover action is much more effective owing to the position of the capital. It is too late, with one German party in neighbourhood of Tabas, to count upon their emissaries being stopped by Persian effort alone from entering Afghanistan. Reliance must therefore be placed on our own measures. (As proved by events at ?) Bushire where we have strong consular guard (with) us, we must expect any action we take against those emissaries to be met with reprisals against our officials in less defensive inland places by the Germans. We have to rely on the Persian Government for their protection and that Government has to be convinced of the earnestness of the two Powers wffio are ready if necessary to force the Persian Government to put an end to the activities of the Germans. That Persia desires to become embroiled in war with two Powers, I do not believe, but there is no denying the fact that great prestige has been given to the German cause by the recent retirement of the Russians in Galicia and Poland, the slow progress in the Dardanelles of the allies and also in Flanders, and the small apparent results (of) entrance of Italy into the war, and have made less unthinkable than before the idea of a rupture of relations between ourselves and Persia, and if at present juncture we fail to show strength the possibility is brought nearer of Persia being dragged into war.G I would urge in view of these circumstances and of the Government of India’s manifestation of uneasiness that it is an urgent necessity that liussia 1 troops should be despatched. Meanwhile Bushire should be occupied by us at once. As for the actual demands which we should make on Persia we shall be able to formulate them better when we know in what position we are to enforce them, but if thev include any specitic measures against the German emissaries they should to that extent, be made jointly.

This force will be used by him in the absence of Russian Cossacks to maintain peace at Meshed and, further, to intercept any German party who may come into vicinity of Meshed. In event of their attacking such party success fully he is authorised to promise tnem handsome rewards. (2) Consul, Sistan, is being authorised to raise, under Dafadars of his escort, a force of fifty Afghan Camelmen to intercept German parties coming within range.

This force will be authorised to operate without regard to frontier of Persia. (4) With regard to Kerman, we are in doubt as to the expediency of the Consul making an attempt to raise local force, now that German agents have actually arrived there. Germans would certainly come to know of such a measure and might organise an immediate attack on the Consulate. However the matter might be left to his discretion. For the present we are not issuing any orders to nim. (5) There would appear to be no necessity to raise a local force with regard to Bushire, but until we learn the decision of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the action to be taken in connection with the recent outrage at Bushire, the question might xemain pending.

If the Gov ernment of India are still of opinion that it is all important that these parties of Germans and Austrians should not be allowed to enter Afghanistan —vide Poreign and Political Department’s telegram No. 623 S., of July 2nd,—it is imperative, iu my opinion, that our 450 Rifles Infantry which are now at Robat and Kacha should be ordered to move to Sistan immediately. As large a number of Chageh Levies as can be spared should be sent to take their place at Rohat and Kacha. It may be necessary for our troops to leave guards | in charge of grain supplies at Koh-i-Malik Slab, until such time as suflicient camels can be collected and sent to that place for removal of grain back to Sistan. If we find that Germans have cleared out, the only way we can intercept them is by means of our cavalry and portion of ’infantry whiedi should come north by forced marches towards Ahwaz which is on border of Afghanistan. Even if it is the intention of Germans to go south either via Birjand or along edge of western desert, I think it should be possible for troops to intercept them near Neh and Shusp. In any case it is necessary that the greatest expedition should be exercised. If Consul-General, Meshed, can spare me any number of surplus rifles and if he would send (them to me with ?) as many old soldier, Hazaras, as he can entertain, I should be glad. It does not seem possible to secure the services of any British officers in time who would be able to command them. If I am permitted to take charge of these until force from south arrives, I shall be ready to do so.

It will (not ?) be necessary to inform the Persian Government about them, if the other troops have crossed the frontier previously. 4 128 Telegram P., No. 316 C., dated the 20th (received 21st) July 1915. From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Officer on Special duty in the Persian Gulf Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. / 1 The latest reports received from several independent sources show that tribesmen on 17th and 18th (dispersed ?) after Wassmuss left for place ( ?), News appears to be correct. -Wassmuss is said to have made a promise to come back at the end of Ramazan and the tribesmen are supposed to have only gone to their homes until that time. The belief that we are at the end of our resources mentioned by Minister in his telegram No. 229 is strongly prevalent amongst the hostile tribesmen, and if active steps are not taken by us to avenge death of the two officers and to punish them for the attack on Bushire they will be confirmed in their view and will think that they have nothing more to fear from the British than from their own Government. I again beg permission to mention that the only course which will be locally understood is for garrison at Bushire to be temporarily reinforced until in co-operation with friendly tribes it is strong enough to undertake punitive measures against the Khans that are hostile to us. The policy a tooth for a tooth is the only one which is understood by these tribesmen. They will not be affected in the slightest degree by seizure of customs as they smuggle in all their requirements (and more for purposes of sale). Therefore as far as their principal offenders are concerned seizure of customs will be quite harmless unless we are ready to enforce Dashti Tangistan coast blockade, assist Shaikhs of Koweit and Qatar and Bahrain to seize or expel from their ports all Tangistan dhows wuth a view to our seizing them on high seas. As regards the towns people, in my opinion, seizure of customs would he considered as quite an unsuitable punishment for the crime, firstly as punishing innocent people and letting guilty party off scot free, and secondly, because seizure would be considered by them merely as a trick on our part to embarrass the finances of Persia. A minor point is the question of managing Customs, present Director and Stall will no doubt refuse to run it and there is no one at Bushire who knows how to do so. To get men from India will be expensive and inconvenient. In view of the fact that, as His Excellency’s Minister observes, Bushire is as it is virtually occupied by us and all Customs receipts are paidia to the Imperial Bank of Persia automatically from a local point of view there already appears to be no advantage at all in seizing Customs store and formally occupying island.

Please refer to your telegram of the 21st July, No. 6640. On the 6th July His Excellency the Viceroy addressed His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan on the subject of German agents in Persia and suggested that the Afghan Government should arrest, disarm and intern German parties in accordance with the rules of neutrality if they entered Afghanistan. Amir will issue his own orders to Governor-General, Kandahar, if he intends to take this line. It is therefore not considered desirable for you to address Governor-General through British Bepresentative on this subject, as this might offend the susceptibilities of His Majesty and might also be interpreted as evidence on our part of undue anxiety. At the same time it is desirable that British Representative, Kandahar, should be told of situation in regard to German agents in Persia for his own information, in order that he may be in position, if questioned by Governor-General, to contradict wild stories regarding approach of Turco-German army, and understand and report any action taken, by Kandahar authorities in this connection.

B. Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. ^ Clear the line. The foEowing is the text of an identical telegram which both Russian Vice-Consul and 1 have telegraphed to our respective Legations at Tehran '.—Begins, To-day a party of four Germans and forty Persian sowars reached Kain. It is believed that probably another forty sowars with machine guns are in vicinity. Word was sent by the German in command that he was Consul; he demanded Istiqbal from people. The whole party repaired to the residence of the Deputy Governor who received them as his guests. They will make Birjand in all probability on 27th July. We think that the Governor of Kainat will receive party as other Governors on the road have received other parties of Germans. British Consul has not succeeded in bis efforts to enlist local tribesmen to oppose this party. We are of opinion that these Germans are proceeding to Birjand and Sistan and not to Afghanistan, in pursuance of general plan of Germans which is to establish, in every district of Persia, an influential party, pending the time when a hostile Persian cabinet will embroil Persia in war on side of Germany. Recognising the fact that for us to attack this party of Germans with our combiued escorts is in itself a risky undertaing and that even were it to succeed, the outcome might result in retaliatory measures against our Consulates elsewhere in Persia, while here in Sistan itself it will be regarded by Persians as an unprovoked assault on Ger- mans, we do not intend to take such action without specific orders from our respective Governments. It strikes us that the longer the party is stationary in Birjand, the grater the opportunity for us to strengthen our position and institute effective measurses. Meanwhile we desire to lay stress on the fact that, during next few days, the existence of small European colony here, even with problematical active support of the Governor, will not be secure. Both my Russian colleague and 1 venture therefore to urge that, as many Cossacks as can be spared, should be sent at once to Birjand from Turbat-i- Daidari, which number should be augmented by a force from India if this is necessary. Ends. If I am mistaken as regards objective of German parly; it appears that only Cossacks, who are now at Turbat-i-Haidari, can intercept ttiem on Afghan frontier. Force of Afghans which I am raising in Sistan cannot reach Birjand before August 2nd.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, To His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain (repeated to Meshed and Baluchistan). My telegram No. 722 S. of 24ith July has apparently crossed your telegram of same date. lor following reasons we cannot at present sanction movement of troops to Sistan from Kacha;— (1) It would appear to be the intention of German parties in north to unite somewhere in the vicinity of Kain or Tabas and to move probably via Gazik into Afghanistan. Risk attaching to despatch of small force on this long and unsupported march and to leaving Kacha garrison in a weakened state is not justified by chance of success. . ^ (^) 1° send troops to Sistan would place them in little better position f° r interception of Germans and owing to attitude of Saiyids and Baluchis might excite situation in Sistan that would be embarrassing for us and would react on Afghanistan in an unfavourable manner.63 (3) When united German parties will comprise some 250 men with six tnachine guns and may have considerable support of local malcontents. Number of troops that could now be spared is only 400—and if the regular troops were to meet with a reverse, this would be deplorable and have worst effect on the Alghan situation. Government of India have therefore decided for present to let troops remain at Kacha to intercept any party of Germans moving in that vicinity from Kerman. For the rest you must do all in your power to get German parties intercepted by means of forces locally raised and handsome subsidies and promises to tribal leaders. 172 Telegram P., No. HI C., dated (and received) the 26th July 1915.

As gendarmerie are open(ly) with hostile faction {vide my telegrams, 191 C , 80—528, 196 C. and numerous others from Shiraz and Bushire), it is most necessary to get tower (referred to in my telegrams, 61—4,22 and 73—4,70) handed over to Governor. In the event of attack I have no doubt gendarmes would either remain passive or more probably assist enemy. In either case it might easily become imperative (?) to turn them out by force, as the tower is an essential point in the scheme of defence of the Isthmus and could not be left in hostile hands. This would of course, be most undesirable and a difficult operation during or in the intervals of an attack by tribesmen.

Following from His Majesty’s Representative at Shiraz, No. 178;— Begins. Please refer to Bushire telegram No. 215 C. Your Excellency can perhaps judge by now whether there is any likeli hood of Persia deliberately throwing in her lot with Germany and Turkey or not. If such an eventuality seems at all likely, I venture to express agree ment with Major Trevor’s view that the sooner the gendarmerie disappear ithe better and that we should do nothing further to support them. If, however, Persian participation in war is improbable or even uncertain, I venture to dissent strongly from Bushire point of view which appears to me rather to take into account interests of Bushire itself than those of Ears .and those of Southern Persia, as a whole. In spite of all their (insolvencies ?) and failings which I fully realise and admit, it cannot be denied that gendarmerie have preserved Southern Persia from anarchy during the last two years and have kept roads open for commerce, posts and travellers. Such situation is, I venture to think, infinitely more beneficial to our interests than a state of chaos which might compel us to intervene and which might involve us in serious embarrassments of many kinds. During the last few days I have been bringing very strong pressure to bear on Captain Pousette with regard to the question of neutrality, etc. He is beyond question sincerely anxious to correct faults of the gendarmerie, and has given me repeated and earnest assurances to this effect. (Above ?) fact combined with my general observation of the situation and personal experience convinces me that the proposal I have outlined is one best suited to what I believe to be our interests, this is, maintenance of order in Southern Persia and prevention of necessity for intervention here.4 But if Your Excellency and His Majesty's Government do not approve further advance being made for the use of the gendarmerie, 1 shall try to formulate alternative proposals.

It was, therefore necessary to decide at once; and it was difficult to differentiate between one tnbe and another In order to allow country to settle down and facilitate the forward movement if settled upon, I accordingly, in consultation with Sir P. Cox decided that we should in principle assume the attitude of readiness to accent submissions generally, provided they appeared bona fide in each case lam now in a position to be able to report that the Chief Sheikhs of all the tribes met with between Kurna and the neighbourhood of Ali Gharbi have made their submission in a formal manner. Starting from Kurna end, Beni Malik, who, until the Turks occupied their villages around the liota position, had been in friendly relations with us, came in at once on our arrival and desired permission to be allowed to return to their homes. Above them on left bank of stream came Mahomet Bairam (?) Yessir (?) and on the right bank the A1 Bu Mahomet (?) Saihud. K ' The Chief Political was visited by the Sheikhs of these sections who made their formal submission. Above them came the head of the section of A1 Bu Mahomet represented by Araibi Pasha on Jahalah canal on the left bank and by Majid Al-Khalifa at Majar Al-Kabir canal on the right bank. They had been from the very first anxious for our arrival and were the first to tender their submission. Pormal visits were paid by their Sheikhs and pending permanent arrangements by ourselves they were subsequently installed in charge of the late Government’s mudirates at their headquarters. On the right bank above them come the Azairij, above and below Amara with headquarters on Majar As-Saghir canal. Their Sheikhs were installed in same way as the last named. This brings us to the extensive tract occupied by Beni Lam above Amara and almost to Kut on the left bank. Ghazban, their principal Sheikh, has of course been the chief mainstay of the Turks in their incursions into Persia; but immediately on our arrival Palin, bis brother, wrote expressing his readiness to hand over to us two Turkish field guns which had fallen into their hands and also offering to submit. We, therefore, decided in spite of their previous hostility to regard the delivery of the guns as evidence of their bona fides and provided Palin and Ghazban came in in person to offer it, agreed to accept their submission. This they did and written assurances were given to the effect that in the event of our moving forward they would if desired co-operate and would in any case guarantee that on the river within their sphere we would not meet with any tribal opposition. Only important tribe up to and beyond Ali Gharbi, apart from Beni Lam, is (?) Bu Durraj. Their Sheikh also in person tendered his submission. As far then as one can judge from the above, no tribal opposition need he expected by us up to Ali Gharbi or possibly up to Kut provided that at the latter place these tribes are not dominated by strong Turkish reinforcements. Many personal jealousies exist between the individual Sheikhs which have always been fomented by the late Government; these tribal elements will therefore be difficult problem and will require careful handling. The position for the present seems satisfactory. Prom outside, our task will be facilitated if Kut-al-Amara which is only a few miles outside conventional y ilayet (of) Basrah can be brought within our present sphere of occupation, including, as it would, the starting point for all irrigation works in Basrah Vilayet from Tigris. Our hold on the tribes in future will depend mainly in no small measure on the extent to which in direction (of) irrigation their agricultural interests are promoted by us.

From what I have been able to see of canals and river and land nn to and forty miles beyond, Amara, country, it is evident, is very fertile and h is immense potentialities. Keystone of its prosperity in the future lies in con. servancy and control over its waters and it appears that interests of His Majesty’s Government and of inhabitants demand the establishment of a system of irrigation which should be administered by most expert irrigation engineers that it is possible for Government of India to provide. Irrigation will be the chief means by which to bring in good revenue and to work out pacification of people, and its administration will mean contentment of tribes or the reverse. Destruction of ancient system of irrigation has resulted in enor mous waste, by leading off of waters by means of large canals which run into marshy areas in most uneconomical manner, or flood lands for a season or else leave them permanently stagnant. An examination of present conditions held by an expert of high water can alone show lines on which improvments are necessary and can be carried out not merely for irrigation purposes alone but also for safe navigation of the Tigris river. I therefore venture to urge tnat a highly qualified engineer should immediately be deputed here with a considerable staff, with the object of inspecting the country and reporting what should be done to lay the foundation of a Mesopotamian river conservancy and irrigation department. .

It could be left entirely unanswered, as it is only a proforma document, but if, as seems to be the case, we are no longer conducting operations on this side of frontier, I should be able to give reply to that effect to the Persian Government.” Cox has sent the following reply No. 1256 B., dated June 17th : “ Your telegram No. 197. lam desired by the Army Commander to suggest a reply somewhat on the following lines in so far as you consider it expedient. Until the Turkish troops from Arnara invaded Arabistan unopposed with avowed purpose of inflicting injury on Great Britain by wrecking Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s pipe lines and attempting attack on British forces at Basrah in flank, not a soldier was landed by us in Persian territory. Persian “Government were either unable or unwilling to take any steps whatever to repel this invasion of their territory and it was not until Turkish troops had been a fortnight in Persian territory and Nasiri itself had been threatened and British pipe line wrecked that Great Britain was compelled to despatch troops to repel eiaetmes of Persia and save further damage to property of the Oil -Company. As it is the destruction of the pipe line was brought about by the Turkish invasion and the Persian Government failed to take any measures to prevent it and consequently the oil industry has been at a standstill for four months thereby causing the Oil Company to lose many thousand pounds •sterling. The bill for this will he presented in due course to the Persian Urovemment as also for expenditure incurred in maintaining British troops in Persia for the expulsion of the Turks and the protection of British property .and lives. In the circumstances, it is astonishing that the Persian Govern ment should be surprised at the operations of British troops in their interests. As a matter of fact, a portion of the British force has already been withdraw n from Persian territory since the Turks have just been expelled beyond Persian frontiers and, until Persian Government has shown herself capable of assuring it herself, only such troops as may be necessary for safety of British life and property in Arabistan will now remain there.

Wnssmuss has been very active lately, and is well supplied witR funds. He lias given large sums to four Confederate Khans and there is considerable competition among these gentlemen for honour (and profit) of putting him up. He has engaged five headmen of sowars and footmen at 50 tomans per month each and about 100 sowars at 18 tomans each and has offered Khans 18 tomans for each sowar and 12 tomans for each footman they can bring. Fur ther he appears to have a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition which he is distributing. He talks very big about being ready on June 26th and about German ships coming up the Gulf and he seems to be getting considerable following. Governor has recently replied to a telegram from the Minister of the Interior that only source of trouble in this district was Wassmuss and that, if the Persian Government could not get him recalled, there would most certainly be trouble and that British would have legitimate grounds for intervening. I venture to suggest that it might be advisable to inform Persian Govern ment that Wassmuss is using all means to stir up Khans to attack Bushire and seems likely to succeed; and that, if Persian Government do not take immediate steps to get him recalled at once, we shall be compelled in our own interests to land men and guns, etc., to protect British lives and property.

His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran telegraphs as follows. No. 207 :—“ The activity of the Germans in the province is increasing. An endeavour is being made-by (?) Wassmuss to organise an attack on Bushire by the local tribes, strengthened by men locally recruited. A party of German (s) and Austrian prisoners of war, who have escaped in some numbers from Trans-Caspia via Meshed, is starting for Birjand and Afghanistan. Another similar party under Greisinger and Zugmeyer is making for Kerman and Pugin is leaving for Meshed. “ Thanks largely to the Germans at Ispahan; the murderer of the Manager of the Bussian bank is still at large and the only satisfaction which the Bussia(ns) have obtained for the outrage is exchange of (?) Sardar Motashem for Sardar Ashjaan, his own brother, as Governor-General, while as yet I have not succeeded iu obtaining the removal of the Governor-General of Ears. The fact is that the Prime Minister is falling more and more under influence of pro-German democrats and though profuse promises are made by him that he will check the intrigues of the Germans nothing of an effective nature is done, and there is a prospect now that Earman Earma, Minister of the Interior, who is the only member of the Cabinet who shows in that direction any degree of energy, will be transferred to Ministry of War, which is nothing but a sinecure, at the instance of the Germans and Turks. In that position he will be of little practical use to us. All representations for effective measures on the part of Persian Government are met by the Prime Minister with threats to resign and with requests for the withdrawal of the Bussian troops. He is in a difficult position. Of Persia’s real interests he is well aware, but any12 steps he may take to protect them are represented as heins: taken in Ancrlo- Bussian interests. He is therefore object of constant attack by strong pro- German elements in AEejlis and tbe Press. “Bussian retirement in Galicia has bad its effect at this moment. “Bussian Minister and I nevertheless see nothing better than to support him, as any other Cabinet wonld probably be worse and not better than the present one. “ Persians will not, I think, join the enemy intentionally, but the d-mirer is that these parties of German agents are so powerful that they cannot without actual fighting be arrested for which no Persian Cabinet cares to be responsible. German Consul, Ispahan, is said to have 200 retainers; while in one or two instances parties number 50 or more armed men with probablv a machine gun. Mission to Afghanistan will therefore possibly be able to reach its destination, while others will succeed in Kerman in producing there tbe same state of things that made it possible for tbe Bussian Bank Manager to be murdered. To authorise His Majesty’s Consul to recruit guards for themselves would be use less, as such action would tend to precipitate a serious incident, such as Germans seem to be seeking to bring about and I can only suggest that in informing tbe Government of Persia of intention of the two Governments to grant them advances a very strong warning should be conveyed to them by us of the dangers they are running and it should be clearly stated that for any untoward results that may be caused by their supiueness there or in the neighbouring countries, Persia will be held to account.

Please refer to my immediately preceding telegram. Following from Minister 208, repeated Bushire, Foreign. Your telegram No. 140. “ Ispahan situation. There are certainly disquieting elements in the situation. Centre of German activities has been transferred from Tehran to Ispahan since the arrival of Bussian troops at Kasvin and four or five German agents,, with perhaps thirty Austrian soldiers, prisoners escaped from Irans-Caspia vid Meshed, and as many as 200 armed retainers recruited locally and from Naib Hussein’s brigands are now at Ispahan. Possibly German plan is to attack Bussian and British Consulate, &amp;c., in the hope that Bussian troops will be sent to Ispahan and that eventually Persia will get embroiled in the war in this way. At present Persian Government have about 4f.0 gendarmerie in Ispahan and more are to be sent from Fars. New Governor-General, Sirdar-i-Ashjaan, whom Bussian Legation believe can be trusted, has a considerable force of Bakhtiari sowars at his disposal. Persian Government has sent orders that German retainers are to be disarmed and there should be no danger if Swedish officers have their men in hand and are sup ported by Governor-General. However, rank and file of gendarmerie and also and moie particularly native officers of that force are reported to be very pro- German in their \iews while at time of Bnssian demand for dismissal of Sardar Mobtashem attitude of Bakhtiaris generally was decidedly defiant and Bussian hold on new Governor-General so far as I can see consists mainlv in his personal relations with Evreinoff. It was on that account mainly that Bussian Legation agreed to his appointment as Mohtashem’s successor. I deprecate personally the withdrawal of Consuls which would be a sign of weakness. Moreover with them colony and telegraph staff would presumably have to shmd/i! 80 ' f 1 ? s T tlmi i late Governor-General’s friendship 1 think Evreinoff hould be sent to Ispahan with a good supply of money.13 Zil-es-Sultan s appointment to Fars was suggested about five weeks ago by Persian Government. At the time it seemed unobjectionable, but proposal Las not been revived. Nothing has been heard of a request for a guarantee made by His Highness.

Mr. Marling’s telegram No. 214, dated 24th instant, regarding German activity, has no doubt been repeated to you by Sir P. Cox and i presume that Consuls at Meshed, Birjand and Kerman are alive to the import ance of preventing the entry into Afghanistan of the Germans and of otherwise neutralising their efforts. Aide Memoire from the Russian Government states that the Karguzar of Sistan reports that one hundred thousand rifles had been distributed by the Amir of Afghanistan and His Majesty was also at the instigation of Turkey, equipping twelve thousand men to march on Meshed. The Persian Government were asked by the Russian Minister at Tehran if they had a force sufficiently large enough to prevent Pugin and the other Germans from reaching Afghanistan. On receiving a reply in the negative, Russian Minister said that Russia would he obliged to take steps herself. It is, the Russian Minister thinks, of first importance that Pugin and his companions should he prevented from reaching Meshed. Enquiry should be made, and, if you see no objection, it would be as well to endeavour to arrange with the Amir if they cross his frontier for immediate arrest and deportation to India of these Germans.

Following from Eis Majesty’s Representative at Shiraz, 191 Begins. Disorderly state of Shiraz and neighbourhood is becoming daily more serious. There are constant robberies in and around town. Armenians are being threatened and assaulted. Situation in town was critical yesterday and serious trouble was only averted by gendarmerie under orders from Pousette. It is becoming increasingly evident that only force to be relied on for maintenance of order both here and on road is gendarmerie and I again venture to urge that if His Majesty’s Government desire to have pence and order maintained in Southern Persia it will be necessary to provide funds for gendarmerie as already proposed. Men have been nearly three months without pay and early decision is necessary. To avoid delav, I suggest that His Majesty’s Government should authorise Your Excellency to expend, say, £50,000 on upkeep of gendarmerie in Ears for one vear, money to he disbursed from time to time as required on demand of Officer Commanding (at) Shiraz addressed to British Consul, llus uould avoid any formalities with Persian Government and would make gendarmerie practic ally dependent on us.

To that our “ply would presumably have to be occupation of Tehran and also an endeavour to seal whole of the frontiers of Afghanistan. enueavour to endeavo'nrTnfto 11 tnrnTeT 011 qU - ite different lilies and shoM endeavour (o) to turn the local feelings against the enemy, and (b) avoid increasing the anti-Bntish feeling in Persia which at present eists j As regards (a), an admirable object lesson is furnished by the Turkish incursion. Its result was to reawaken against the Turks latent hostili v of G,e Persians and to make the much talked of jehad a complete failure Germans or rather Wassmuss with his plan of attack on Bushire may (also ?)' render their cause similarly disastrous); and proof is that efforts are now being made by the German Minister to induce Wassmuss to return to lehran just as an appeal was made by the Turkish Ambassador to Raouf to withdraw to Turkey. Presumably now Bushire ought to be in a position to defend itself and I can think of nothing that would be more helpful to us than (Wassmuss?)’s attack. We should in another direction endeavour to utilise press and with that object in view I have just been enabled to make arrangements by having had some funds placed by His Majesty’s Government at my disposal. W e should, as regards (S), avoid any overt action against Germans and should invariably take action through the Persian Government. In this direction the present Cabinet has done something and I have succeeded in getting strong instructions despatched to the Governors of Sistan and Kerman to hold up emissaries of the enemy and disarm their followers but whether these instructions will be carried out effectively depends upon the support we can give them. This is like everything in Persia a question of money more than anything else. The value of this weapon has been well understood by the Germans and since my arrival here in the middle of April I have every reason to believe that the enemies’ missions here have disposed of at least £50,000 while the agents of the Germans in the provinces of Persia appear to be pro portionately well supplied. Our policy until quite recently has on the contrary been not to use money on any scale compared to this, except in Southern Persia, but I feel that if I can be granted, say, £5,000 a month and if our reluctance to employ these means is now overcome much can be done to stimulate the courage of the Persian Government and its supporters of (?) party in Mejlis and also by subsiding some of the local papers to cause a veering round of public opinion in our favour. At any rate experiment (?) (when compared with?) action which I cannot but regard as certain to produce most regretable results is worth trying. At all events it is not a costly method and in the event of its failure does not preclude us from the possibility of trying the more drastic measures con templated by you which latter, moreover, could, in no circumstances, I appre hend, be undertaken except after consultation with Russia.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London (repeated to His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran). Clear the Hue. Persia. Please refer to your clear the line telegram of 7th July. . On the 6th instant instructions were issued to local authorities in the same sense and will be repeated. At same time our view of situation in Afghanistan appears to have been entirely misunderstood by Marling. We have every reason to distrust popular attitude in Afghanistan, which is pro-Turkish, fanatical and inflammable to a degree, though we have good reason to believe in Amii s sincere desire to maintain neutrality. Presence of German agents with armed parties in Afghanistan would almost certainly provoke situation there which would make it doubtful whether the Amir would be in a position to persevere in his present attitude, and Government of India might be faced with a position which would strain their resources to fullest extent reacting as it certainly would on the whole Indian frontier, including Baluchistan. It was with the object of obviating such a possibility that it was proposed to emplov troops to intercept German parties which might be attempting to cross v'a Perso-Baluch border into Afghanistan or Sistan in much the same manner as troops have in the past been used to intercept arms traffic, but Government of India only proposed this as a last resort. If Persian authorities in interior are competent to deal with German parties, so much the better. Instructions which were issued by Government of India to Consul, Kerman, afforded them every opportunity of doing so and. no action in inteiior of Persia was suggested by Government of India which was not in consonance with rules of neutrahty as hitherto observed. It is only in the event of failure on the part of local authorities m interior of Persia, that Government of India proposed ^ aS £°.

To-day both Russian Minister and I, at an audience we had of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, pointed out the danger towards which Persia is drifting and we also informed His Majesty that our respective Governments would view Cabinets resignation, at bidding of a minority in Mejlis, as a sign that Persia was under the influence of the enemy and that as there could be no prospect of Persia observing a real neutrality in those circumstances by putting an end to the German intrigues and preventing their endeavours to create troubles in Afghanistan, etc., the only course open to us was to suggest to our respective Governments that they should consider what measures they themselves should adoprt tor the protection of their own interests. We also urged upon His Majesty that he should exert his influence to keep present Ministry in office. It seems from the Shah s rep y Cabinet has at length definitely resigned, and that, although His Majesty would like to maintain it, he doubts his ability to do so. Crisis is therefore likely to continue, and no action can be taken to hold up emissaries going to Afghanistan so long as it lasts.

In spite of the prospect of seeing the late Persian Cabinet resume office with increased prestige, I think that in view of the opinion expressed by His Majesty’s Consul, Birjand (please see bis telegram No. 100 C.), that the local Persian authorities would prove unable to stop German parties. Preparations to send troops from Kacha should be pushed forward for action as suggested by him. These ( ?) should be able to deal with any parties travelling via Khadis or Bam. But it would be more difficult to intercept party which the Consul at Yazd reports as having left Nain for Tabas on 6th instant via Anarak (Yazd tele gram, 6th, which was repeated to Meshed and Sistan) and party seems to be too numerous to be dealt with even by methods put forward by His Majesty’s Consul, Birjand, which by His Majesty’s Government we are prevented from using.

Presumably a force will still be in reserve at Pobat, whose presence will have great moral effect especially on Sarbaddis south of Koh-i- Mahk Siah. Last night I saw Governor. He maintains that he cannot arrest or interfere with Germans without definite orders from his Govern ment. He says at the same time that, if his Government permit Germans to enter Sistan, he will threaten to resign on account of mischief they may do intriguing with Baluchis. I observed that apparently neutrality of Persian Government is so pronounced that the Persian authorities will not interfere if a British force of 300 men were to encounter a German force of ISO men in neighbourhood of Sistan. He concurred in this, declaring at the same time that if ordered to do so his garrison at Sistan is quite capable of dealing with Germans. I hold a different opinion as to this. It must also be remembered that Persian authorities are particularly inert during month of Bamazan and resent being called upon to take any active measure's. Until it is certain that a German party is making for Sistan, I do not advise our troops crossing the frontier. Repeated to Tehran 40, Meshed and Baluchistan.

Should attempt be made, I recommend that Officer Commanding, Robat, be ordered to intervene, as if supplies are carried away much inconvenience will be experienced by troops.

In amplification of my telegram No. 128 of do-day's date, informing you of my interview of yesterday evening with Sardar-i-Asbjaa, I have now the honour to report as follows : My Russian Colleague having expressed the desire to accompany me when 1 should call on the Sardar-i-Ashjaa in pursuance of the instructions contained in your telegram No. 51 of the loth instant, I arranged wilh M. Hildebrandt that we should pay a joint visit yesterday evening to His Lxceilency who had for some days past been soliciting an interview with me. In a preliminary discussion on our line of action M.

(/e) Rukn-ul-Mulk (the present Head of the local Tribunal-Adliyeh) brother of the Qawam-ud-Dowleh—Mutammid-i-Khaqan—* formerly Governor-General of Ispahan. (m) Mirza Ahmad Khan Mir Panjeh, whose name and qualifications are known to you. His Excellency said that No. 1 having refused the choice lay between Nos. 2 and 3. Personally he inclined to No. 2, but would wish to be guided by our private advice. X gave my unqualified and my Colleague a somewhat qualified assent to His Excellency’s choice. (2) The Pulpit and the Press. His Excellency on his own accord brought in the question of the “ Mimber ” and my Colleague (who seems even more susceptible than other llussians of my acquaintance to the utterances of the Press) brought in that of the local rag “ Zayandeh Roud” remarking on the fact that the Editor thereof holds the post of Public Procurator attached to the Adliyeh. His Excellency gave us very profuse assurances that both the Clergy and the newsmongers will be forced by him to observe the declared neutrality of Persia. (3) The Police. After consulting us as to the desirability of maintaining in office the present Acting Chief of Police (Sultan Mahmud Khan of the gendarmerie), His Excellency himself hesitated between this course and the appointment of Mirza Ahmad Khan Mir Panjeh to the post—Sardar-i-Asbjaa said that he had been passing sleepless nights in his earnest consideration of the question of the local Police, the number of whom (130 or thereabouts) as at present sanc tioned in the provincial budget is absolutely inadequate. He was about to apply to Tehran for an increase. My Colleague and 1 to whom His Excellency appealed to support this application seized the opportunity to point out that the enrolment here of a larger number of untrained police would hardly make matters better, but we undertook to give our fullest support to an application which His Excellency declared himself prepared to make for a hundred trained policemen from Tehran. I pointed out that the sum sanctioned for the military budget (Ts. 4,200 per month) was far in excess of the local requirements. As a matter of fact the number of officers and sarbazes maintained out of it (150 to 200) absorbed only about Ts. 1,800 per month, tho major part went into somebody’s pocket. JBy transferring Ts. 2,000 from the Military to the Police Budget it should be possible to increase the police force very considerably. His Excellency said that he would examine this question with the Acting Comptroller of Finance with a view to seeing how far it would be possible to approach the desideratum for the Ispahan Police, viz., 500 men. (4) Gendarmerie. Sardar-i-Ashjaa said that, while he was anxious to do everything in his power to maintain the neutrality of Persia, he would like to feel that in so doing he would be fully supported. He broadly hinted at the possibility of the gendarmerie turning against him, and alluded to the many reports current regarding the pro-German proclivities of the local gendarmerie officers. M. Hildebrandt and I assured His Excellency .that in our opinion he could rely most fully, as we did ourselves, on the loyalty of Captain (xleerup (for other officers we could not speak) and that as to the possibility to which HisS3 Excellency had alluded, of Sweden entering field of war in support of Germany, His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran alluding to reports to this effect circulated by the Germans, had qualified any such action on the part of Sweden as an absolute impossibility. Throughout the interview above reported I was careful to adopt the most friendly phraseology and, in compliance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram No. 53 of the 18th instant, to avoid anv appearance* of endeavouring to wring conditions from the Sardar-i-Ashjaa. All the proposals made by His Excellency were spontaneous. In this connection it may he of interest to you to know that at a meetino* of Bakhtiari Ulama notables and merchants held on luth instant at the house of Sadr-ul-Ulama (please refer to my telegram No. 124 of 17th instant)—as I am informed—a telegram from the Cabinet was read appointing Sardar-i- Ashjaa Governor-General, the wording of which excited the suspicions of the Clergy present and caused some of them to declare that in their belief the Government was laying a trap and intended eventually to despatch Prince IS usrat-us-Sultaneh hither probably without giving any previous notice. . ^ s hall not fail to use my best endeavours to conjure any suspicions of this nature from the mind of Sardar-i-Ashjaa and shall continue to “ mark time ” till I receive some other word of command from you. . 1 P r °pose however to profit by the present apparently favourable disposi tion of the new Governor-General to press for settlement of various lomr- outstandmg British cases (more particularly certain claims of th« I have, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., Tehran.

The crisis in regard to the Cabinet still continues and although it seems a certainty, that office will be retained by Ain-ed-Dov leh he already talks of doing so without the Minister of Interior Parman Parma. Ain-ed-Dowleb will, should this final concession be made to the pro-German party, be so dependent on them that to expect that anything effective will be do'ne to check German action here will be hopeless. As it is by the resignation of the Ministry, the small beginning to fulfil frequent promises made to me to bold up German emissaries proceeding east has been arrested. The whole fact of the matter is that there is a very general belief, which is carefully fostered by the Turks and Germans, and from which Ain-ed-Dowleh is by no means exempt, that our allies and ourselves are in desperate position; contrast is being drawn between the mild action taken for the murder of her Vice-Consul at Ispahan by Russia and the vigour with which she would in the past have displayed her displeasure at such an occurrence, and the conclusion is drawn that even in Persia, Russia is really powerless to help herself. No doubt Ain-ed-Dowleh may know better, but he prefers not to risk with the noisy demorcratic minority in the Mejlis his present popularity by taking measures of an energetic nature to put an end to the constant and flagrant violation by Germans and their allies of Persian neutrality, and he thinks that lie can satisfy us with promises and half measures as we do not show ourselves capable of protecting our own interests here. In regard to the future he reflects that if friction between the two legations were possible during the war when their Governments were allies, disagreements between them in future may make it possible for Persia to play one Power off against the other as before the Agreement of 1907. With this state of things in the-Capital we are now confronted with an attack on the Bushire Residency, an attack of which the Persian Government had had every knowledge and warning and which is beyond question directly due to German intrigue. I submit that it is absolutely imperative coming as it does on the outrage at Ispahan, that decisive action should at once be taken by Russia and ourselves and 1 would urge for the consideration of the two Governments that Russian forces at Resht and Kasvin should be raised to -5,000 men with a proper proportion of guns and cavalry (which Ain-ed-Dowleb now agrees is necessary) and that Mokammerah, Lingah, Bunder Abbas and Bushire should be seized and Hormuz occupied and that when we have done £0 the Persian Government be informed that until reparation is made for the attack at Bushire and until German intrigues are put a stop to, by the arrest of the various German Agents now at work in Persia, we shall retain possession of these towns. If Ain-ed-Dowleh should not retain office such action (will become all ,tbe ?) more necessary. If we fail to do this we must be prepared to see the Germans free to do what they like, except where we are able to use our own resources, and to be exposed to the possibility of furtfl o r outrages.The Russian Minister is communicating to Petrograd these views will, wiiich he entirely agrees.

From— r lhe IIon’ble Lieotenant-Colovel Sir Percy Cox K C I E C S I Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. r Attack which was recently made on ns at Bushire and which has been long expected and planned, and of which the Persian Government since the time of Listeman s arrest, has had full warning, is indistinguishable from an act of war; hut I know that the policy of His Majesty’s Government is not to treat it as such. I venture however as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to urge that v'e should make prompt use of incident both to oblige Persian Government to adopt a really neutral demeanour and to get them to° abandon their present attitude of veiled hostility, and also to institute active measures on our part for preservation in Pars and elsewhere of those interests which Persian Government is unw illing or unable to protect. In the former direction I v'ould urge that we present an ultimatum to the Government of Persia based on following lines :— (1) That the present Governor-General of Pars should be recalled at once and his recall made public by announcement. (2) That forthwith the gendarmes in Pars should be recalled to their duties on the road and that they should be withdrawn altogether from Bushire-Borasjun section which should be handed over to the charge of the Governor of Bushire, who will maintain a guard from funds to be drawn from Bushire custom house under our supervision. (3) Arrest or recall of all Germans in Pars. (i) Deposition and proclamation as outlaws of following local Khans, viz., Rais Ali, Dilwari; Zair Takly of Tangistan; Sheikh Hussein of Chahkutah, and his son Mahomet, who have been concerned in the recent attack on Bushire; and removal of Ghazanfar-us- Saltaneh of Borasjun and his replacement by a nominee who will be agreeable to us; and expulsion from Pars of Saiyid Murteza, the hero of the disturbances of 1909 and who is now concerned with the above persons. In the event of Persian Government failing to accept these terms within 48 hours and failing execution within 10 days, we should, pending compliance with above ultimatum, assume control over the custom house at Bushire, hold revenue, and disallow the despatch of merchandise inland. If military resources admit of it, as Resident I would further recommend that w r e should send an armed reconnaissance to raze the towers of the Khan of Chahkutah (and his ?) son at Ahmadi and of the Khan of Borasjun at Lorasjun, w r e should also bombard the town of Dilwari from the sea as has been done before. If we were to take this action and were to warn friendly Khans of our ntentions, I am confident latter wmuld of themsei\es co-operate in tie nterests of law and order and settle affairs in the Bushire hinteiland in a ray which would be conducive to the future interests of His Majesty s Government. In fact they have repeatedly made offers to do so. It does not seem to me as a layman that, for the occupation of the Bushiie ustom house and action above recommended, garrison would need to De m- reased temporarily by more than two regiments, one mountain battery, and w'o squadrons of cavalry. It would be necessary to have a man-of-war conti nually present. As regards Germans, it is shown by experience that all rascally eiements a the Busbire hinterland are in favour of the German faction, and, so tar, tier of bribes, no matter how great the amounts, has produced no results. Mure of the attack on Bushire, it is possible, may, however, alter the * tua ion, and it is also possible that, as has happened on the Tigris, some ot their ecent friends may now be ready to turn on the Germans.

The Russian Consul-General is not satisfied with the reply received from his Government and wants definite orders authorising, him to employ Cossacks to arrest party. Latest idea which has struck the Governor-General is that they will be able to secure the disarmament of the Germans by persuasion and that resort to force- will not be necessary. I have sent a private warning to the Deputy Governor of Herat, (who has in many instances prevented suspicious characters from entering into Afghanistan and turned away others) telling him that the Germans may possibly try to enter Afghanistan; he has accordingly issued, orders that a careful watch must be kept and that no foreigners should be permitted to cross the frontier.

The number and composition of the party is not yet known, but it is estimated at one hundred, and the informer saw two guns; the other half of which is following is a party of similar strength. Nidibin was visited by me and advised to ask for the assistance of Cossacks or at any rate to request that pending further orders, the Cossacks be sent to Turbat-i-Haidari, but without sanction from his Government he refused to do any (thing). It was a°reed by _ us in consultation with the Russian Consul-General that it was of the highest importance that Cossacks should at once be sent and he asked if Your Excellency with the Russian Minister would compel the Persian Government to send orders to the Governor-General to employ Cossacks and to render them every assistance.

Germans have more than once interrupted Indo- European Department wires south of Ispahan and German Consul there has even written to Departments officers threatening to do so*- ActsActs of this kind and this considerable concentra tion at Ispahan obviously implies more than a mere attack on our Consulates, and popular rumour here asserts that German design urged by democrats is to carry off the Shah, and Government to Ispahan,- This is far-fetched, but it is not improbable that hostile Legations contem plate flight to Ispahan should Russian troops arrive at Kasvin and threaten the capital.

Prom this centre with communications open to Turkey via Kermanshah they would hope to throw all Persia into disorder, and paralyse the Persian Government f s action by destruction of telegraph lines, and trust to a chapter of accidents to involve her in war with us. It has also occurred to me that they might be contemplat ing an attack on oil fields or threatening our position at Basrahr As before-said.Bakhtiari loyalty cannot be relied upon, while at least one party of Germans has left Ispahan for unknown destination by southern road, and they nay be trying to rouse the tribes as example of (group undecypher able)-Sr Sirdar Assad also has informed me in a manner that implied menaces that he was trying to make an alli ance with the Kashgais, and Kawam, and the number of small German parties going armed may indicate that attempts to ^ain over those powerful elements are being made* These speculations may seem far-fetched, but I can offer no better guess at the objects of German prepara tions at Ispahan,.

Prom—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To—His Majesty the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.B., G.C.M.G/ Aflei compliments. Information, has reached me that a number of German agents are now in Persia attempting to stir up trouble, contrary to the law ot neutrality, and endeavouring, by this means, if possible, to embroil the Persian Government in the .present war. These German agents are, in some cases, accompanied by Austrian war prisoners who have escaped from Hussian territory and by lurks, and are moving in small armed parties eastwards, with a view, apparently, to entering Afghan territory. For instance, one party is reported to be proceeding towards Birjand, via Meshed; another party has left Isfahan for Kerman and will probably proceed thence towards the Afghan frontier, via Sistan \ another party has left Isfahan in the direction of Birjand, via Nain and Jandak, and there is news of other parties, further west in Persia, moving in the same direction. The total strength of these parties, so far as has at present been ascertained, amounts to 26 Germans and Austrians, 43 lurks and Armenians, 23 Indians and 87 Persians: altogether 179 men, armed for the most part with rifles and with two machine °guns. These parties are at present scattered, but it is possible that they may unite before reaching the Afghan border. That armed parties of this kind should move about in a neutral country* attempting to stir up trouble, is a flagrant breach of the law of neutrality, and steps are of course being taken to move the Persian Government to deal with the matter, but it is possible that, in spite of these diplomatic measures, these German parties may still find their way to Your Majesty’s territories. Should they do so, I would suggest to Your Majesty that you should issue orders for them to be treated as such parties would be treated in any other neutral country with a strong and effective Government (such as is the Government of Afghanistan), namely, that the party or parties should at once be arrested, disarmed and interned, pending the conclusion of the war. By such action Your Majesty would not only be acting in accordance with the principle of neutrality to which you are so staunchly and honourably adhering, but would also prevent these parties from exciting the more ignorant and fanatical portion of Your Majesty’s subjects by false stories and wild promises. I have thought it right to give Your Majesty the earliest information of this possible contingency and also to advise you how such a contingency can best be dealt with, and I feel no doubt whatever that Your Majesty will, in conformity with the correct and honourable attitude which you have adopted, accept my advice.— Usual ending. * Amir Qabiballa Khan- Received on 4 AUG 1915 /itl1 INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

(Repeated to Teheran.) Foreign Secret. ^ our telegram of the IGih July. German agents in Persia. In spite of request of Consul at Seistan that troops should at once he moved from Kacha to Seistan, we have decided to keep troops at Kacha for the present for following reasons : —(1) It appears to be intention of bulk of German parties to unite somewhere near Tab has and to cross into Afghanistan probably via Kain and Gazik. Owing to distance troops could not. we think, arrive in time to intercept these parties. (2) Reinforcements have not yet reached Kacha, and risk of sending small force on long and unsupported march and leaving Kacha garrison weakened is not justified by chance of success. (3) If troops merely went to Seistan they would be no better placed for interception of gang than at Kacha, while presence of small British force in Seistan might excite embarrassing situation there owing to attitude of Persian Baluchis and Sayyids that would react unfavourably on Afghan border. (4) If troops are to be used we should be certain of success. These German parties when united will amount to about 250 men with six machine guns and may command large support of local malcontents. Any reverse to our regular troops would have deplorable effect both locally and in Afghanistan. We therefore prefer for the present to keep troops at Kacha with a view to intercept any German party that may move from Kerman, in that vicinity, and to trust to our Consuls being able to deal with German parties in north by means of local forces and promises-yf handsome rewards to tribal leaders, in addition to measures taken by Russians. We are again addressing Amir furnishing further details of German parties and asking him to contradict wild rumours that they are vanguard of Turco-German army.[ThlB Docnment la toe Property of me Brttonnlc Majeaty'a Oovemment. and shonld ne retnmed to me Foreign Office when done rer.nlred for official nsej ^ IOU RUSSIA MILITARY Decypher of telegram from Sir G.Buchanan (Petrograd.).

Aide-memoire from the Russian Government informs me that Governor General of Turkestan has just formed an expeditionary corps composed of about 1,000 horse with four machine guns under the command of Colonel Goustchine. The force has already crossed the Persian frontier and is advancing against the German Caravan which is com ing from Tebbes. Russian Government express the opinion that this con siderable force will vamply suffice to intercept German caravans which are marching as much on the Afghan frontier as' on Meshed and which counted together do not amount to more than 500 men. In these circumstances the formation of force of 100 men by His Majesty's Consul General at Meshed, your telegram No.1528, appears to Russian Govern ment superfluous. The latter consider it preferable for the Government of India to undertake patrol as we control southern portion of Persia and Afghan boundary provinces where it would be difficult for Russian troops to arrive while the latter would undertake the same service for the northern portion of this region.[This Document Is Ilia Properly of His Britannic Majesty^ Qover^^enti and should be retumea to the forsign Ottice when done wllh nniftint required for offlolal nso.] Decypher, Iir.

' (Repeated to Tehran, Basra, and Bus hire ) Foreign Secret. Persia. Reference to Minister at Tehran's letter to Foreign Oifice, No. 247, dated 14th July. We agree with Marling that time for strong action has arrived. We entirely support proposal for increase of Russian garrison in North, hut we do not agree with Marling that seizure of Mohammera, Lingah, Bunder Abbas and Hormuz is desirable. To occupy Mohammera forcibly would be to estrange a valuable friend who has deserved well of us and possibly again to excite tribes astride the pipe-line. To occupy Bunder Abbas, Lingah and Hormuz, which presents no difficulty in taking, would be to dissipate our strength and to expose small garrison to tribal attack such as has recently occurred at Bushire ; nor would such action be very effective. We consider that the most suitable action would be at once to assume administration of Bushire, take over control of customs house, bold revenue and disallow despatch of merchandise inland. This should be done without intimation to Persian Government, who should be left to question our action themselves. We should in this way give proof of seriousness of our intentions and at the same time place onus of discussion on Persian Government. When questioned our Minister might inform Persian Government that the action taken at Bushire is due to conviction unwillingly forced upon His Majesty’s Government that the Persinn Government are no longer able to maintain order in Bushire and its neighbourhood, of which fresh confirmation is found in the regrettable attack made by 300 tribesmen, in which two British officers were killed and several sepoys killed and wounded. further, that it is clear to His Majesty’s Government from the fact that the Persian Government are permitting various armed parties of Austrians and Germans to recruit Persian sowars, and to leave Ispahan and Kerman with supplies of arms and ammunition, that the Persian Government are either unwilling or unable to prevent Southern Persia being made a base of hostile operations against England and her Allies. His Majesty’s Government cannot tolerate a situation of this kind, and are reluctantly compelled to take such measures as she may consider necessary for the protection of her own inteiests. But if the Persian Government are now prepared to deal seriously and effectively with matters constantly brought to their notice, he is prepared to state terms of the British Government, but not otherwise. These terms should be that within a week Persian Government must: (1) Take definite steps to punish Khans concerned in Bushire outrage; (2) pay compensation at the rate oi 5,000L for each British officer killed in the outrage, 500?. for each sepoy killed and 100?. for each sepov wo inded ; d) take definite action in regard to Germans now in Persia by having them disarmed, arrested, and interned or handed over to us for deportation ; (4) recall present Governor-General o F&amp;rs a If Persian Government fail to comply with terms Within time specified,. British Government will not only retain Bnshire but will take such further action to safeguard their interests as the necessities of the situation may dlCt \Ve do not in any circa instances propose that military operations should be taken outside Bushire at present, except that Uilwar J’fLmmck be from sea. We should he content merely to defend, and should attack he repeated trust it may be effectively repelled. v , rl „„ While we feel that action of some kind ,s absolutely necessary to bung home to the Persian Government the impossibility of allowing ^mn mn Austrian hostile machinations in Persia to proceed close our eyes to the fact that if Persia shou i in consi &lt;1 - i lioible Great Britain and Russia, although Persia herself is quantity, it. will certainly become much more mndencies of his tain his position of neutrality in opposition o te ''j unrest amongst subjects, and it will probably create bitterness of feeling and among our own Muhammedan population.Telegram from the Viceroy.. .

Your telegram No. 622 S. to Bushire appears to indicate that your confidence as regards Afghanistan is not so complete as I have been hitherto led to believe (please (group omitted ?see) correspondence ending with your telegram 68 S.) and that you consider it of first importance to prevent German and Turkish Emissaries from reaching that country and are prepared to send troops into Persia for the purpose. Such a course especially if successful appears to me to be calculated to bring about results we desire to avoid Appearance of troops and capture by them of these emissar ies would give tremendous impetus to German agitation here and would vastly strengthen position of pro-German party in Medjliss. Even moderates would be carried away by care fully excited outcry against us, and a Government would be formed entirely subservient to German interests and reck less enough to carry out German objects by sending Persian agents into Afghanistan. Our reply to that would have presumably to be to endeavour to seal whole of Afghanistan frontier and certainly aiso to occupy Teheran. In my opinion we should proceed on Quite different lines and should endeavour (D(1) -to turn local feeling against enemy and (2) avoid increasing existing anti-British feeling in Persia. As regards (1), Turkish incursion furnishes an admir able object less-on. Its result was to re-awake latent hostility of Persians against Turks and also to make much talked of Jehad complete failure. Germans or rather Y/ass- muss with his plan of attack on Bushire may render their cause similar disservice: and proof is that German Minis ter is now trying to induce YVassmuss to return to ieheran just as Turkish Ambassador appealed to Raouf to withdraw to Turkey. Presumably Bushire ought to be now able to defend itself and I can think of nothing more helpful to us than Yfessmuss's attack. In another direction we should endeavour to dtilize press and I have just been enaoled to make arrangements with that object by having had some funds placed at my disposal by His Majesty's Government. As regards (2) we should avoid any overt action against Germans and (?operate provisionally) through Persian Government. Present Cabinet has done something in this direction and I have obtained despatch of strong in structions to Governors of Kerman and Seistan to hold up enemy emissaries and disarm their followers but it depends on what support we can give them whether these instructions will be carried out effectively. Like everything in Persia this/question of money more than anything else. Germans have well understood value of this weapon and I have every reason to believe since I arrived here in middle of April eneny missions here have been able to dispose of £50,000 at least, while German agents in provinces appear to be proportionately well supplied. Until quite recently our policy&lt;■ policy on the contrary lias net contemplated use, except in south, of money on any ccale comparable to this but I feel convinced t' at if our iluctance to employ these maans is now overcome and T . can be furnished with say £5,000 a month much can be done to stimulate courage of Government and its supporters of (?moderate) party in Medjliss and by wb^ r ortrteg some of local papers to cause public opinion to veer round in our favour. At any rate experiment as an alternative to action which I cannot but regard as certain to produce most regrettable results is worth trying. It is at all events not costly and should it fail does not preclude possibility of trying more drastic measures you contemplate which latter moreover could, I apprehend, in no circumstances be undertaken except after consultation with Russia* I am repeating telegram to Foreign Office as well as your telegram No. 622 S.! 2456 o From Vicerotj, 3rd July 191 Foreign Secret. Your telegram of the 25th ultimo. We have authorised the following steps to counter German agents in Persia and to prevent their entering into Afghanistan :— (1.) Consul, Kerman, has been instructed to spend Secret Service money freely with object of putting leading men against such parties, getting them boycotted, and collecting information with regard to their numbers, move ments and -eawpai gns— which information he will at once pass on to Consul, Seistau, and Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan. (2.) Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, has been instructed to authorise Political Officers on the Perso-Baluchistan frontier to spend money freely in collecting information, and to proceed against any party of German agents approaching the frontier, with militia and such local forces as ma\ be available, and to destroy them. . . (3.) Consul, Seistan, has been instructed to collect information in similar manner and to co-operate with the Officer Commanding the hobat detach ment, which will be reinforced by two squadrons cavalry, two machine guns, and, if possible, detachment of Imperial Service Camel Corps. If German parties enter Seistan, Officer Commanding is authorised if possible to intercept and destroy them with this force. (4.) Consul-General, Meshed, has been asked to arrange with his Russian colleague if possible for Russian troops to capture or annihilate any party of Germans attempting to enter Afghanistan via Birjand or Meshed, and to collect information and pass it on as in other cases. I am writing to the Amir warning him of the possible advent of German parties to Afghanistan, and advising him to have them arrested, disarmed and interned pending conclusion of war. I do not think it wise to suggest deportation to India as this would be contrary to ordinary rule of neutrality, and might make Amir suspect that we were trying to embroil him with Cjt nxiciiis ^Information reported by Russian Government regarding distribution of rifles in Afghanistan and intended despatch of Afghan troops to Meshed is so far as we know, baseless. Similar report was received by Consul-General for Persia and contradicted by us. 4 U ^PLBSIa. J POLIIIOaI,. Decypher cf telegram from Jar. karliag(Teherau) D. 8.30 p.n. June 26th. H.

According to Karguzar this expedition is due to instances of the Turnisn government which is trying to persuade Ameer to take up arms and to force Persia to take part in struggle lor defence Islam. Russian Minister profited by the occasion (?to) ask if Persian Government disposed of sufficient force to prevent caravans of the German agents with Pugene at tneir nead from proceeding towards Meshed and the Russian and Af^nan frontiers. Minister having replied thare ware no gendarmes at Meshed Russian Minister pointed out that in that case we should be probably obliged to take steps to prevent state of things arising which would be danger xo Persia herself. Aide-memoire concludes by stating' uhao Russian Minister , considers it to be of first important to prevent Pugene and his companions from reaching Meshed. \ t- jPERSIA. 2 339 POT.ITICAL. r 25JUN1^|t) De cypher, Mr. Marling (Teheran) June 24th 191 o.

Prime Minister meets all representations for effective measures on the part of Persian Government with reouests for the withdrawal of Euseian troops and with threats to resign. K e is in difficult position. He is well aware of Persia's real&gt; &lt;' 'J real interests but any steps iie rray take to protect them art represented as being taken in Anglo-Russian interests and he is therefore object of constant attack by press and strong pro German element in Mejlis. Russian retirement in Galicia is not without its eifect at this moment. Nevertheless Russian Minister and I see nothing better than to support him as any other Cabinet would be no better and probably worse than present one. I do not think that Persia will intentionally join eneriy: danger is that (2 groups undecypherable) German agents are sc powerful (in one or two instances they number fifty or more armed men with probably a machine gun, while German Consul at Ispahan is said to have two hundred retainers) that they can not be arrested without actual fighting for which no Persian Cabinet cares to be responsible. Thus it is possible that Mission to Afghanistan will reach its destination while others will succeed in producing in Kerman state of things that made murder of Russian Bank Manager possible. It would be useless to authorise His Majesty's Consuls , to recruit guards for themselves as this would tend to precipitate a serious incident such as agent seems to be seeking to bring about and I can only suggest that in inform ing Persian Government of intention ox two Governments grant them advances we should warn them very strongly oi dangers they are running and inform them that Persia Wj.11 ce held to account for any untoward results that may he.caused there or in neighbouring countries by their supineness.
