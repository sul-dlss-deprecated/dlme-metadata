The presence of an \"ankh,\" or life sign, in his right hand is unusual for a statue that does not represent either a king or a god. In this case, it may be an item used in temple ceremonies. The statue's inscriptions request benefits for Hor-nakht from the gods Amen-re and Osiris, including life, prosperity, and health.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/22462", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "19th Dynasty", "Reign": "Ramesses II (1279-1213 BC)", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.017", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.105_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.105_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.105_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.105_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.105_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2280", "Images": "PL1_22.105_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
