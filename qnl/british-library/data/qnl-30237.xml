Politicail Agent, Muscat, Political Resident, Bushire Dated 7th January 1943» Sheikh Muhammad bin Isa elder son of Sheikh Isa bin Salih al Harithi visited me on the 2nd and 4th January, Last reference to him is in Muscat memorandum No.C/114 22nd April 1933 to you. 2. Sheikh Muhammad brought a letter from his father stating vaguely that ''things are happening in contravention of the terms fixed by your High Government between us and the Muscat Government' and further stating that he addressed me w as Sultan is in Dhofar and his Ministers here do not reply satisfactorily to Sheikh's representations. 3. My view is that this letter an oblique attempt to get us interested in Sheikh's efforts to obtain for himself more than a fair share of the rice coming in to Muscat. This view supported by the fact that Sheixh Muhammad's only, specific request to me was that he should be allotted part of the Muscat rice quota so that he could import it in his own boat from India; the implication being that the Muscat State authorities do not allow a fair quantity of rice for export to Oman. 4. I refused Sheikh's request for part of quota since to grant it would form a most unfortunate precedent for the allot#nent of the quota to other than established traders; and, further, I believe that the Muscat Government has seen to it that the Sheikh is getting his fair share of rice through the ordinary trade channels. 5. If you approve I propose to take the following / further■■■■■■I further action:- (a) reply to Sheikh Isa^ letter that the British Government was not a party to the 1920 treaty and that questions concerning it should be settled amicably between him and the Muscat Government. (b) inform the Sultan of the incident at the first opportunity and tell him that we do not want any trouble from the Omanis and that we expect him to cope with them. -POLITICAL-mmmwKmmmmmamsmammmmam 4 (P Telegram Q From Political Resident, Bushire.

Following for Pelly. In continuation of ray telegram No.137 January 12th. Presume you are satisfied that Shaikh Isa bin Saleh*s letter had no deeper political siginificance. He was a prime instigator of Oman ?rising in last war, and is connect- ed by aarriage with Imam. His family has a record of implacable hostility to Al Said. His remark about the Sultan’s absenteeism seems pointed and visit may have been intended to test our support of latter. 2. Did you gather what he meant by H things happen- sfr- s i(VolS) ing in contravention of 1920 treaty ,, and whether this referrec to recent strengthening of Muscat State forces which ?thev regard as a threat to them ? -BRITCONSUL-Telegram From Q Political Agent, Muscat. Political Resident, Bushire. To No.C/93. Dated 8th February 1943* Demi-Official for Colonel Prior. 6. b Yo'or telegram No.213 18tli January. Am satisfied letter had no deeper political significance and that visit was not intended to test our support of Sultan. 2. Omani camelmen have been held up for smuggling at the Customs post established at Ruwi five months ago. I think the phrase ’•things happening in contravention of the 1920 treaty” was an attempt dishonestly to represent the Customs restrictions partcularly at Ruwi and necessary restrictions on rice export from Muscat as contraventions of the treaty. 3. I mentioned visit to Sultan at Dhofar. He told me he had written letter to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh explaining necessity rice restrictions. 4. Am taking action as directed in your telegram P'V No.137 12th January. -POLITICAL-</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000028_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/265</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000028</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/265</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/67 MUSCAT STATE AFFAIRS: MUSCAT – OMAN TREATY.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1942/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-26T22:09:05</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (8 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 10; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file concerns a letter received by the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat from Shaikh Isa bin Salih al Harthi [Shaikh ‘Īsá bin Ṣāliḥ al-Ḥārthī], in which the Shaikh mentions that the Muscat Government, in the absence of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], has been contravening certain terms of the 1920 treaty [a treaty between the Sultan and the Omani tribes].
