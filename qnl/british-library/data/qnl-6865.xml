The Future of Mesopotamia. [E.G. 173.] (Note by Sir Percy Cox.) I. 1. Before dealing with lesser issues I should like to state the position as I understand it to be at present, to make sure that I start from the right premises. (i) In the proclamation which we issued on our arrival at Baghdad we announced to the people, and, in the Press, to the world at large, that we came as friends and not as conquerors, to emancipate the inhabitants of the country from the oppressive rule of the Turks, and to assist them to work out their destiny on more auspicious lines. Incidentally we invited them to come forward and take part in the administration. (ii) In the announcement of policy made by His Majesty's Government in the telegram of 2l)th March 1917, from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, it was stated that, whereas it was contemplated that the Basrah Vilayet (as then defined) should 44 remain permanently under British administration ' and annexation w T as deiinitely indicated, the Baghdad Vilayet, on the other hand, was to be formed into an Arab State or Province under British protection, in everything but name. 2. During the year that has since elapsed the general situation has undergone considerable development, an important feature of which has been the entry of America into the war, and in the latter connection certain fundamental principles have been enunciated for which America in particular and the other Allies in general are considered to be fighting. Of these principles the one which particularly concerns us at the moment requires that the peoples of the countries interested or affected should be allowed to determine their own form of government. Uecentlv the Prime Minister has publicly stated that the destinies of Palestine, Mesopotamia, &amp;c., will be decided at the Peace Conference. 3. I gather that it is now proposed to deliberate as to what particular steps or line of action are advisable in order to square our working policy with the above principle and announcements, in case we should have to adhere to them in spite of the fact that Germany has not respected them in dealing with conquered territory in Russia. 4. I assume that, if at the end of the war we find ourselves in a sufficiently strong- position, and in effective administrative control, we should still hope to annex the Basrah Vilayet and exercise a veiled protectorate over the Baghdad Vilayet; but it is recognised that the question of annexation has become exceedingly difficult ms-d-vis the President of the United States, who will presumably exercise the most potent influence at the Peace Conference. Our original proposals must consequently be regarded as a counsel of perfection, and we must be prepared to accept something less. At any rate, however, we have the strongest grounds, in view of our assurances to the inhabitants and the millions of money we have sunk in making the Port, for standing out for the annexation of Basrah and from thence to the sea, with a small block of territory necessary to round off the enclave. As regards the rest of the occupied territories, the essential aim must be to effect the complete elimination of Turkish suzerainty, and it is assumed that we shall leave no stone unturned to achieve that end, only tolerating its retention in the last resort. 5. In any case we must set our faces against the admission of the slightest Turkish element or participation in the administration. In this connection, I should mention that when I was in Cairo it was suggested that, as events were shaping, we 10 s 4 175 11/18 • amight be obliged or decide to come to some compromise with Turkey at any moment • I also learnt there of Sherif Faisal's secret overtures to the Turks; and when asked' my opinion I expressed the view r that if in the last resort we were compelled to come to some compromise with Turkey I did not consider that the retention of nominal Turkish suzerainty need be considered altogether incompatible with the realisation of our practical aims, always provided chat the country were safeguarded against the least control or interference by Turkey in the administration. As cases in point we have the precedent of Egypt and the more pertinent one of Koweit. The fact is that the bulk of the people of the country are not concerned with abstract theories or niceties of international principle ; for example, so long as the Shaikh of Koweit feels assured that his interests are under our practical protection, and are safe in our hands, he does not trouble his head as to whether in the distance Turkish suzerainty exists or not. I think the position would be the same in the case of the inhabitants of Iraq, where nine-tenths of them are altogether inarticulate, and all they are concerned with is the manner of their treatment by the Government actually in control of Baghdad. As regards the remaining tenth, who are capable of understanding the real issues, they would of course not be completely reassured (supposing that the fiction of Turkish suzerainty were being maintained) unless they were absolutely safeguarded against the participation of Turkey in the administration. 1 assume, therefore, that w r e are on common ground in considering that if the Turks were to be allowed to retain the suzerainty of Mesopotamia {minus Basrah) they must, at any rate, be completely eliminated from the administration, and that it must be our mission to ensure that Iraq obtains the administration which the country needs and which her future demands. There must be no Turkish Commissioner and no Turkish flag. A special flag must be devised. 6. Alluding for a moment to the question of relative status, as between the Basrah and Baghdad Vilayets respectively, it is my very definite opinion that a homogeneous administration in all practical aspects is not in any way incompatible with a technical difference of political status, and that it is essential in the interests of the countrv that the administration of both Vilayets should be uniform, that of the Basrah Vilayet being brought into line with Baghdad in due course. 7. In considering the precise form of the administration there are several alterna tives to be weighed in the balance, and attached to each alternative are subsidiary difficulties which need consideration. For the moment we will consider the Baghdad Vilayet only, on the hypothesis that Basrah Vilayet can be made to conform to it at a convenient juncture. 8. The question of the ' Arab facade ' offers no insurmountable difficulties to my mind. The essential problem is the determination of status to be assigned to the province of Iraq. It is agreed that the administration should be under British guidance, and the more complete the British control can be, the better for the country. In fact, unless it is assured the country has no future, for it would be impossible to get money for its development unless investors are satisfied that their interests are fully safeguarded, a condition which cannot be assured except under protective British supervision. How is that supervision to be achieved? The most satisfactory solution would seem to be government by a High Commissioner assisted by a Council, formed partly of the Heads of the most important Departments of State, and partly of representative non-official members frOm among the inhabitants. But the foreign relations of such a government must obviously lie in British hands, and it would thus be practically a British protectorate. 9. If such an arrangement could be achieved and recognised by the Powers, well and good ; but if not, then the existence of a titular native ruler would become a necessity. 1 do not think it would be impossible to find one, but the difficulty is that if the administration were given such a form it might be difficult for it to avoid being hampered by capitulations, and the right to consular representation by Foreign Powers ; the former contingency being one which we should obviously do our utmost to escape. 10. If it is decided that we should have a nominal headpiece to the administration to conduct his own foreign affairs under British guidance, 1 think, as I have said above, that it would be possible to find a local candidate, and f cannot see the least3 justilication or necessily for intro.luciuR one of the family of the Shent of Mecca lo play (his role. I have always ventured to deplore the fact that the discussion of the future of Iraq with the Sherif, as one of the pawns in the negotiations with him, was ever permitted I have also expressed my views plainly on the political and practical obiections to recognising him as King of Arabia and Sovereign of a group ol Con federate Slates. In my opinion a more reasonable solution would be that he should remain King of Ilejaz, and, if desired, have his own representative with Foreign Powers, while the foreign relations of the Iraq State, and ol the other contederate Aral) Potentates or States, should lie in our hands. For the Aral) liuler ol the Iraq State a title might be devised conveying something less than King, c 3., Sultan or Ilakim (liuler), and all (he Confederate Rnlers would nndoubtedly pay appropriate deference to Kine: Hussein as iSherif of the Holy Places in ihe Hejaz. If con&amp;idoied essential in view ot' their commitments to the Sheril, His Majesty s bovcrnmmt mioht even decide to guarantee the payment to him of an annual snbsidv in some 101m iiom the revenues of Iraq, as recognition of his services to the cause of Arab independence during the war ; or, as a religious contribution towards the upkeep of the -Holy Places. II. Obseuvatioks on the more Detailed Issues. 11. Can any Arah authority, dynastic or representative, he discovered that will command the necessary moral sanction in the country as a uhole 9 11 hat ncKjht dots King llu ssein or his family carry ivitli the local Arabs ? In my opinion, we liave in the Wicjib of 1 Baghdad and his familv a dvnastic element which would carry tlie necessary moral sanction, in the Baghdad \ ilayet undoul)tedly, and, in my opinion, in Iraq as a whole. I believe they could be brought to identify themselves with British interests. Ihe present Naqdj himself possesses a \ei\ gie.il prestige and influence not only in Mesopotamia but among the Mohammedans of India,'and I feel sure his selection as Head of the State would be regarded as an appropriate solution, and be received with favour throughout India as \\oll as Mesopotamia. The Naqib considers himseli superior, in purity of descent and nobility, to the Sherif, and no less important, and the jntioduction &lt;&gt;1 a iclati\e of tlu Sherif of Mecca as head of the State of Iraq would, in my opinion, be greatly misunderstood and resented by the Naqib and his family, and thus tend to alienate our most potent element ol inlluence over the Arabs of Iraq, l^ing Hussein and his family carry no weight in Iiaq, where only the most distant interest is taken in iiim. In the early days of the Sherifs entry into the lists, when the question of giving him military help was being discussed, the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, wan asked by the War Office whether the failure or collapse of the Sherif would prejudice our military or political interests in Mesopotamia. W e leplied altei delibeiate consideration that the inhabitants had not been at all moved bv his successes, and would, in our opinion, regard his failure with complete indifference. 12. What materials exist for setting up a Local Administration or Administrations of a suitable character ? There is adequate Arab or local material available or in the makhig for the sub ordinate services of the administration. The dilliculty we are confronted with at present, and must be for some time to come, is to find individuals suitable for higher posts in the administration, e.g., Mutessarifs, Qaimaqams, such as would be tilled m the Indian administration by gazetted officers—Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners. The reason is that under the Turkish regime almost all these posts were filled by pure Turks; these have been eliminated, and there is at present no one to lill their place. Wherever we have tried ex-officers of the late Administration they have almost invariably proved unsatisfactory ; they are in fact saturated with the evil traditions of the regime in which they have been brought up and trained. Until we can create this element, enlisting as far as we are able the assistance of the Egyptian and Soudan Administrations, we must rely mainly on young British officers. 1 may mention here that whereas I have done my utmost to employ experimentally any inhabitants of the country at all likely to be suitable, this laudable endeavour tinds no favour with the local inhabitants concerned. I am continually appealed to by them not to place the conduct of their affairs in the hands of ex-officials of the late regime, s 4 a 24 even lliough they be Arabs of the country, on the ground that they have all been born and bred in a vicious school oi' corruption and cannot rise above the evil traditions of the past. The population, from the cultivator to the well-to-do merchant or land owner, infinitely prefers to be handled by a British oilicer, who of course employs Arab subordinates. 13. I fully realise the importance of finding or creating a type suitable for employment in the superior posts, but the fact is that it does not at present exist. In the more subordinate posts our personnel is almost entirely indigenous. Where other elements, Indian or English, are employed it is almost entirely in the purely clerical or technical branches of the Headquarter Administration, e.g., clerical and cypher branches, English branch of Government Press, &amp;c. The following is a rough analysis of employees in the Baghdad Vilayet: — Arab, Armenian, Christian, Jew, ex-exployees of the late Govern ment taken over by us - - - - - - 210 Newly sanctioned by us :— Mohammedans of Iraq - - - - 17 Domiciled Persians of Iraq - - - - - 16 Jews of Iraq - - - - - 60 Christians, Syrians, Chaldeans - - - - 132 Egyptians - - - -* - 3 Indian Christians ______ 19 British-born Europeans - - - - 35 (Government offices, Government Press, &amp;c.) 14. The highest type of official corresponding to those who function as Heads of Departments and Ministers of State does not exist in Mesopotamia; they will have to be imported. 15. To what extent is the Adininistration hasea on Indian models, and to what extent is British supervision indisjwnsable? Except in that the Iraq Occupied Territories ' Code of Law applied in Basrah is based on English and Indian Law (just as the Soudan Code is) the administration is not in any way based on Indian models. We have taken over the structure of the Turkish administrative system as we found it, substituting British officers for Mutessarifs, Qaimaqams, &amp;c., but for the present designating them Political Officers and Assistant Political Officers, while in the posts which, under the Turks, would have been filled by an official of the status of Mudir, we have been able to employ natives of the country subject to the exception that wherever British garrisons or troops are located it is essential, owing to the difficulty of the language question, and the fact that the local product cannot be left to deal with our troops, to use British officers, and we thus require more of them now than will be necessary in the permanent administration, after the troops have left. But apart from that, as I have explained above, until we can produce the necessary type of superior Arab official more extensive and close supervision by British officers will continue to be necessary. 16. In my opinion, with the unavoidable exception of the military regime of the Military Governors in the large towns, the administration as carried on now in Basrah and Baghdad Vilayats is that to which the people, both urban and rural, have been accustomed, except that the element of corruption is greatly reduced. 17. The branches of the administration in which we are necessarily most backward, and in regard to which our hands are in a great measure tied during the military occupation by military considerations and exigencies, are the Civil Judicial and Civil Medical. 18. As regards the former, Mr. Bonham Carter, the Judicial Officer who was lately appointed from Egypt, has only been with me a short time, but is now getting into the saddle. I have submitted to the India Office a copy of proposals for a temporary judicial system for the Baghdad Vilayet formulated by him in consultation with me. It seems to me just what is required. Meanwhile, such local law and justice as has be.'ii essential has been administered by my district Political Officers with simple civil5 and criminal powers granted them by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief on my recommendation. As a matter of fact, outside the large towns we have been little troubled with civil and commercial suits, incapable of adjustment by compromise through the good oifices of the local Political Officer. 19. As regards the Civil Medical branch. We are almost ready for the separation of the Civil Medical work from that of the Army Medical, and just before I left I raised the question with the Director of .Medical Services as to whether the time had not now come for creating a Civil Medical Department with a separate personnel, though still to be under his general supervision. It is under lively consideration. A similar separation has recently been effected in the Department of Civil Posts, but in these matters we are so dependent on the military organisation that we have to defer to their views to a great extent as to when developments are feasible. 20. The extent and the period for irhich British and Indian Troops icillhe required after the War is a difficult question for me to answer without discussion with the military authorities, and depends so much on the position in which we are left at the end of the war. In peace times the Turks employed about 20,000 regulars of all arms, and 3,000 gendarmerie for the maintenance of security and order in the Baghdad and Basrah Vilayets. I should say that, for a peace establishment for internal security only, we should require for some time after the war to keep a division in Mesopotamia with one British regiment to a Brigade as at present constituted, and about the same number of gendarmerie, exclusive of 1,000 civil police for the towns. In the course of time we should hope to replace the Indian troops by Arabs, organised on the lines of the Egyptian Army, but it must necessarily take some years. 1 am not of the opinion that any Indian police will be required, except small leavens to begin with to form a nucleus for the training of the indigenous product. I hope that in this field we shall be able to give employment to the Arab ex-officer of the Turkish Army, otherwise this class will be a difficult and malcontent element to deal with. 21. The directions in ichich we can most use fully direct our energies with a view to popularising our Administration are Irrigation, Education, and Civil Medical. In all these departments we are alive to the importance of speedy progreas, and are doing our utmost compatible with existing conditions and with the material at our disposal. 22. The elements that ice most need to encourage are : Firstly, the Jewish com munity in Baghdad. In this connection I recommend that Dr. Weizman be induced, if possible, to pay a visit or send a reliable representative to Baghdad to influence the Jewish community in favour of the British connection. Secondly, the Arab notables and nobility among the townspeople of Baghdad and Basrah. They are a somewhat impecunious and backward element, but one which it is very necessary to encourage and take into our counsels as far as possible. Thirdly, the wealthy landlord element, both Arab and Jew, and the important Shaikhs of the settled tribes. If it becomes a question of obtaining public expression of feeling in favour of British control, it can be done; but I think the subject would have to be handled cautiously. The intelligent inhabitants of Iraq at the back of their minds are possessed by the apprehension that Mesopotamia may conceivably be restored to the Turks at the Peace Conference, and as long as this nightmare is present with them we should merely emphasise it by asking them which Government they would prefer. By so doing we should be clearly putting them in a very unfair position because they know well that if they elect for British control and if nevertheless the Turks were ultimately to return, all those who had declared for us would receive short shrift. It will be understood that the rural population of Iraq as a whole is quite inarticulate and can hardly be consulted. As regards the elements who do count, e.g., the Jews and other denominational communities in the large towns, they could without doubt be squared in some form to give expression to the sentiments that we desire. But we must consider and decide what is to be regarded as constituting the representative public opinion which we have to consult. 23. Steps to be taken to consolidate Commercial Influence in Mesopotamia. 1 he great initial difficulty here is the absence of commercial transport and general scarcity of tonnage and accommodation, and last, but not least, the uncertainty of theG future. It is difficult to encourage private enterprise when accommodation for agencies is not available. Sites and land cannot be sold, and machinery cannot be imported. We are most anxious to encourage trade generally, but to announce that trade to Baghdad is open is to suggest that commercial tonnage both by sea and by river is available and not liable to be requisitioned. Another difficulty is that, owing to the importance of preventing supplies reaching the enemy from the markets of Iraq, we have not only to maintain an external blockade cordon, but have also to limit exports inland from Basrah to the minimum requirements of the towns and communities inside occupied territory. This in itself interferes greatly with the natural flow of trade, yet we can only relax our safeguards with great caution. As a matter of fact r there has quite recently been some easing of the blockade. P. Z.

It consists of two main parts. The first part deals with the premises for British policy, namely, the proclamation issued on British arrival in Baghdad, that they had come to emancipate the country from the 'oppressive rule' of Turkey; the announcement of policy in the telegram, 29 March 1917, from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy which advocated annexation of the Basrah [Basra] Vilayet and the creation of a 'veiled protectorate' in Baghdad Vilayet.It discusses the 'difficulties' this would create with President Woodrow Wilson's principles of self-determination (paragraph 4) and the issues surrounding the creation of an 'Arab facade'.Part II deals with observations on more detailed issues and considers: the nature of Arab authority, dynastic or representative and Arab attitudes to King Hussein, Sherif of the Holy Places in the Hejaz [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī, Shereef of Mecca]; personnel available for establishing a local administration; relevance of Indian models of administration and British supervision; requirements for Indian troops after the end of hostilities; ways of popularising British administration through irrigation, education and civilian health; elements the British should foster; measures to consolidate commercial influence in Mesopotamia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ottoman Empire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002ae#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
