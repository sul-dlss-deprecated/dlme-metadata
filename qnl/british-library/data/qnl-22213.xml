PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LTD. CONFIDENTIAL BAHRAIN PERSIAN GULF. DO/PCN.1/4170 POth March, 1946 ^ My'dear Colonel, Many thanks for your note No 17th March 1946. C/279 dated the 2. Last July I approached Mr. Belgrave with a view to purchasing some Government land on which to build Company houses in Manama and also asked him for assistance in arranging the water supply or permission to drill a water well. He put this before His Highness who surprised him by making some unexpected conditions. In effect, His Highness made a satisfactory settlement of the Qatar/Bshrain disputes, a condition to helping A/*., us with the facilities required. Mr. Belgrave had jo apparently discussed the matter with Mr. Pelly and I sent Mr. Pelly copies of correspondenceBelgrave then went on leave. Mr. Pelly left and I anticipated the matter would have to wait for Mr. Belgrave’s return. 3. In Mr. Belgrave T s absence, however, His Highness approached me through an intermediary and volunteered to help the Company in exchange for an assurance that the Company would not interfere with the mosque and cemeteries at Zubarah. I had it conveyed to him that I had no doubt that the Company would be pleased to provide the necessary assurance but the correct cnannel should be through the Political Agent, Bahrain. 4. Nothing further accrued until Mr. Belgrave 1 s return, when I told^him of His Highness’ offer. He found His Highness a little vague on the exact wording of the assurance and eventually induced His Highness to produce his own draft which reads as follows ”1 assure you that the Company’s operations in 'latar will not trespass upon firstly the mosques, secondly the cemeteries, thirdly the properties of the Khalifa at Zubara”.DO/PCN.1/4170 (contd.) The addition of 'properties” alters the matter entirely. The expression covers a wide range including such controversial points as water wells, forts and land. The Ruler of Qatar might view with a certain amount of displeasure direct contacts between His High ness and this Company but he could not voice his objec tions very strongly on an assurance given to respect Moslem mosques and graves. He would, however, be well within his rights to object very forcibly to the Company’s implied acceptance of Bahrain’s claims to 'properties'. 5. Unless His Highness can be persuaded to specify the 'properties' and these 'properties' are of a nature which will not give rise to controversies, there seems to be small hope of a successful issue. In any case, it is highly desirable that the Shaikh of Qatar should not receive the impression that the Company are responsible^ in any way for the revival of the Zubarah dispute and, in these circumstances, it is submitted that now that the matter cannot be confined to mosques and graves it is advisable that His Highness should function through the normal channel (the Political Agent) and the Political Agent should contact the Company and the Ruler of Qatar as necessary.

'Zubarah case* and I dare say it may come to the forefront soon. that you still require land in Bahrain and that it is required conjointly for P.C.L. ^atar, Trucial Coast, Muscat and Dhofar. An unfortunate impression has grown up in Bahrain that your office is the Qatar Office, which it may be, but that is only a part of its functions. If you wanted the land for P.C.L.

I enclose a copy of a recent letter to Mr. Belgrave, no.DO/PCN. 1/ 4194 dated the 18th April 1946, on this question of land acquisition. Later I had an opportunity of discussing the letter with him and he very kindly offered to help us if necessary in the Land Registry Office. 2. We are buying land next to the Cable &amp; Wireless house on the Juffair Road sufficient for two houses and the transaction is so far proceeding smoothly. We are paying Rs.1/4/- per square foot.

In my no.DO/CY. 1/4008 dated the 1st August 1945 (copy attached) addressed to Mr. Belgrave, of which I think Mr. Pelly had a copy later, I made it clear (for the information of His Highness) that our activities in Bahrain combine Petroleum Concessions Limited, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, Petroleum Development (Oman &amp; Dhofar) Limited as well as Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, and the new accommodation for which we are planning is concerned in varying degrees with the needs of all these Companies during the next few years.

My dear selgrave, I am sorry to trouble you again on the ruestion of the building sites. I had hoped that Mr. Wheatley would be visiting Bahrain and I could have got some guidance in this rather delicate matter. Unfortunately he could not fit in the visit and has left for home. I realise now that it is unreasonable for us to expect any assistance from the Government. In endeavouring to make our own arrangements, however, we should very much like to feel that if we can come to an agreement with a private owner the person concerned will not change his mind inexplicably when the transaction reaches the final stage. I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any further details as the position is known to you. I feel that it is highly desirable to rush through the purchase when the opportunity arises. I should be most grateful for your personal advice in the solving of our problem to acquire sufficient land to build our transients quarters and a house for Mr. ball. If you could spare me a few minutes in the near future I should like to explain our plans. Again many apologies for adding to your problems, Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) E.V.Packer. C.

I am sorry that we are adding to your problems. 1 notice that you mark your letter 'personal'. Will it be in order for me to discuss our difficulties with the Political Agent and later to explain the situation to our Managing Director ? Before doing this, however, it has occurred to me that you may care to put the following aspects of the matter to n.M. Our Office combines Petroleum Concessions Ltd., Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd., Petroleum Development (Oman &amp; Dhofar) Limited as well as the work in connection with Qatar, and the new accommodation for which we are planning caters for the needs during the next few years of all these companies. After some years it is expected that Qatar will become almost completely self-supporting. The second aspect is that the Ruler of Qatar has always objected strongly to the Company’s use of Bahrain as a port for unloading its enuip- ment and as the local purchase centre. It has long been a source of annoy ance to him that Bahrain revenues benefit considerably from customs transit dues on our oil eauipment and that Bahrain dhows bring water to zekrit. Nothing would delight the Ruler more than to hear that difficulties have arisen for us in Bahrain. In fact it can be expected that he will take this opportunity to press the Company again to use Dohah as its port thereby expecting the flow of money and prosperity to his main port. It could be inferred from your letter that the object of b.b’s attitude in the matter of P.C.L. accommodation is to induce the Company to use any influence it may possess, either directly or indirectly, to change the Shaikh of Qatar’s attitude on the Zubarah controversy. Even if it were in order for us to approach the Shaikh on a matter in which B.M.G. was the arbitrator it is obvious that the Shaikh of Qatar will do nothing to help us to continue to use Bahrain facilities. As explained above, the sooner we get out the better he will be pleased. If these aspects can be put to B.B. we are not without hope that the kindnesses and facilities we have experienced at the hands of His Highness in the past will be repeated in this case of the comfort and well-being of our British and Indian staff. yours sincerely, C.

No. C/617 The 10th June, 1946 Dear Belgrave, I understand from packer that P.C.L. require to buy some Government land in Manamah to assist them in conducting operations concerning all their concessions, and not only Qatar. 2. You may find difficulties in the way because of the quarrel between the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar, but I doubt whether Shaikh Salman would really wish to hinder British interests for the sake of this quarrel, particularly as by not helping British oil interests on the island and putting difficulties in their way he would tend to drive P.C.L. away to Qatar. This would detract from the position which Bahrain is, I am glad to say, acquiring, as the focal point in the Gulf. 3. I would be glad if you could let me have your remarks without raising the subject either with His Highness or Packer. C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government B a h r a 1 n.

My dear Colonel, You will probably know that we have permission by the courtesy of the Bahrain Government to use our Sitra jetty for our Bahrain-Q,atar launch service. This was granted on the under standing that Company passengers only would be disembarking there. A complication is that the Qatar Shaikhs and Saleh al Mana try to get passages for non-Company Qataris. They are perfectly willing for us to take the risk of losing this privilege as a result of our infringement of the conditions. V/e have told them that unless we get prior permission from you and the Bahrain Government, we cannot permit passengers to embark at Zekrit for disembarkation at Sitra. I have told Saleh that he can confirm the position from you if he so You will understand, of course, that the regulation against carrying non—Company passengers to Sitra suits us admirably as ve do not want to start such a traffic, which would soon become a real nuisance. This matter has come under notice as a result of a recent refusal by Dickson to carry a passenger sent him by Saleh, xears ago we brought over one or two cases of serious illness involving danger to life and these were reported to the Political Agent before disembarkation. We do not wish, however, that it shouM be assumed by Saleh that a plea of illness will ensure a passage, as the opportunity will be abused. We should prefer to have no fixed understanding regarding exceptions to the rule. I am writing this letter so that you will be au fait with the situation should Saleh approach you in the matter.

No.C/617 dated 10th dune 1946, PacKer told me, some time ago, that the Company wished to buy three building sites for houses, we discussed possible locations and decided upon a site on the Jufair road. Unfortunately I did not obtain His Highness T s approval before going into the matter with Packer, it did not occur to me that he would have any objection to selling land in an area which we would like to see developed. The Bahrain Government does occasionally sell land as for example the large areas in Manama, Muharraq and Jufair which were sold to the British Government. Later I told His Highness about the matter. He was exceedingly annoyed and said that he would not sanction any sale; I therefore had to tell Packer that the deal was off. I tried for some time to persuade His Highness to change his mind but without success. Though I personally do not agree with His Highness T s action in this matter I do not think that his general attitude towards the P.C.L. has been unhelpful.

He says that he Ccune yesterday to you co report tne following, for your information only, in case it will come to your notice. He imported two ,, International' , lorries in transit to Saudi Arabia, but he kept them in Bahrain for sale to the public, but no one has come to buy them. it is a system in Bahrain that if any goods arrived at Bahrain in transit, the importer has to pay 21 j transhipment duty. As he wants to dispose of them in Bahrain, Haji Yusuf paid the full duty of 10£- Tbe above two lorries remained unsold for two months. P.C.L.bought one of them for their work at Qatar, and it has been shipped to Qatar. The information about the sale and shipment reached H.H., and he rang up Haji Yusuf's son Ibrahim asking why the lorry has been sold to P.C.L., and shipped to Qatar. Haji Yusuf says that he has never ^-thought that H.H. will not accept the sale of cars to P.C.L. for Qatar. He s tnau P.C.L. is a Britisn interest, and ne sold tne car to her. It happened that he visited the Adviser for export of some old dates, and during the talk, and in a joking way he told the Adviser ” H.H. is angry with me, because we have sold a lorry to P.C.L. for Qatar'. The Adviser replied him that he received a letter from H.H.enquiring how the export of the lorry has been allowed to Qatar for P.C.L. Haji Yusuf says should H.H. not wanting anything to be sold by the merchants to P.C.L.they should be informed secretly beforehand, and not after.

Your Highness is doubtless aware thac for a long time the sca^e of my health has made it difficult and embarassing for me to have the pleasure of calling on you. It has corne to my notice recently that certain purchases made by the company in Bahrain for export to .^atar have incurred Your Highness's disapproval. This has caused us all considerable concern in that it is our first aim to comply in every wav with v °ur Highness's wishes. We are particularly anxious to clear up any misunderstanding as we are indebted to vour Highness for many favours in the past. position in general is that we should like to continue to make purchases from Bahrain as we have done in the past for the purposes of the Company's operations in Qatar, and in the case of foodstuffs for consumption by our Company employees. 4. rhe main categories of our purchases from the Bahrain merchants or markets are shown below, ‘your Highness will see that with the exception of motor vehicles' the purchases are all of a minor nature. jn addition, the interests of Bahrain pur chasers are protected in that it is necessary for the company to obtain export permits for all local purchases from the Director of Customs (and Food Controller) who scrutinises all the^lists personally with the utmost care. The sanction of the political Agent also is necessary in most of these cases. (a) Foods tuffs (i) Fresh meat Poultry Fresh vegetables . Potatoes Eggs (ii) Dry and tinned provisions (b) Miscellaneous small items of mess, camp and machinery equipment, medicines, etc. (c) Motor vehicles. 5. As we understand your Highness is particularly perturbed regarding certain recent transactions concluded or impending, in which motor vehicles are involved, we are dealing with motor vehicles first in principle, and following this with particulars of the abovementioned transactions. We are assuming that Your Highness is not concerned with vehicles belonging to the company passing through Bahrain in transit, or with vehicles ordered from Bahrain Agents and consigned to these Agents under the category M In transit, to Qatar'. T .7e believe, however, that you object to (a) Sales to us for export to Qatar of vehicles brought in, in transit to Arabia or rruciul Coast and (b) Sales to us for export to Qatar of vehicles imported into Bahrain ostensibly for sale and use in Bahrain.S S- © - 2 - 7. e on this subject we should like to know if Your Highness any objection to the company applying for export permits the export to the 'frucial coast of vehicles purchased in Particulars of actual transactions mentioned in para 5 as follows. All the vehicles concerned are for Company except the last. (a) 3 Dodge 15 cwt. Trucks, secondhand, bought from ? £300/- each. Total Rs.12,000/-. Export to Qatar refused.

I have been turning the matter over in my mind and find that I am still of the same opinion as when I first read your letter. 2. My recollection of the conversation is that you said that Shaikh Salman had requested, or in some way conveyed to you, that you should visit him and it was to this that I agreed. If he has any statement to make to you that is altogether different from your writing to him in anticipation and in an endeavour to clear up certain points. So far as I know he has done nothing overtly, and has but clandestinely hindered the smooth wording of P.C.L. If you have any complaint to make on this score, you should, I suggest, make it officially through me. To write in an apologetic tone to the Shaikh can only result, so far as I can see, in strengthening his hand. 3. If he feels inclined to take up any matter in conversation with you I can see no harm in that, but I do not at all like your writing to the Shaikh on the lines of your draft. It may be that you are experiencing difficulties which are unknown to me, and which might demand the issue of some such letter as you suggest. In any case I should welcome your comments on this letter. 4. I am returning the draft herewith. v ours sincerely. E.V. Packer, Ssq., Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Ltd., Bahrain.BAHRAIN RECEIPT. ...

DO/PCT.1/4732 18th February 1947 My dear Colonel, EXPORT PERMITS TO QATAR As you know, I had an interview with H.H. Shaikh Sulman on the afternoon of the 15th February 1947 . The visit lasted an hour and a half. I was received with the utmost friendliness, and H.H. stated that he would agree to the export of anything from Bahrain, provided it was clearly understood that these exports were for the us e of the Company and its employees, and were not to be diverted by any method whatsoever to the Q,atar Shaikhs or Qatar is not in the employment of the Company. I did not touch on articles in transit to saudi Arabia or for transhipment to Saudi Arabia, as I think this savours of evasion, and Ihs an un pleasant aspect. In such cases I think personally it will be better if the importer pays full Bahrain customs, and we buy from him and apply in the usual way for an Export Permit. In other words, I would prefer that the Conpany should not be directly involved in transactions in which the object is to divert consignments, in transit to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar. 2. His Highness also mentioned that he would agree to the Company buying land in Bahrain. 3. As I anticipated, however, the subject of Zubara was eventually introduced, and reference made to previous verbal assurances by me that the Company would not inter fere in any way with the tombs and mosques there. On this occasion, however, the word houses’ jalso came up. As far as I know, there are only a few rei^ants of houses, but it was not thought appropriate to point this out. As under the terms of our Concession mosques, graveyards, private houses or other buildings are protected, there is, in my view, no harm in the Company putting the assurance in writing. In any case if anything was to be achieved and the existing deadlock broken, it was necessary to take a decision, and I therefore gave His Highness to understand that I would confirm the assurance he required • • •DO/PCT.1/4732 (contd.) in writing when he visited me next morning. Further more there were indications that procrastination would have led to H.H. taking counsel and probably attempting to widen the issue. 4. I enclose copies of my assurance to H.H., and H.H’s letter to me, also H.H. f s instructions to the Director of Customs (all English Translations). I think you will agree that the object of my interview - to establish better relations with His Highness, and obtain his co-operation, and the facilities required by the Company in connection with its operations in Qatar - has been achieved. It remains to be seen, however, how long these improved relations can last, in the face of possible Ihrther controversial matters affecting Qatar and Bahrain directly, and the Company indirectly. 5. In conclusion, I should add that I was a little perturbed when it became necessary for me to commit my self to givii^ H.H. his assurance, without confirming from you that you had no objection. I could not, however conceive of any objection to such a simple statement in view of the fact that I was authorised to make my attempt It also occurred to me that you might prefer not to be associated with the matter if it could be avoided.

'phis should have cleared the air a good deal, and on the whole is probably to the good, but I will reserve further comment until I have received an official communication. 2 .

No.C/256 The 25th of February, 1947 My dear packer, Thank you for your letter No. DO/PCT.1/4732, dated the 18th February, 1947.‘ 2. Since both Qatar and Bahrain are within my juris diction I have to consider your letter from the Qatar and Bahrain angles. 3. As regards the former, it is doubtful to my mind if you should really have mentioned in writing the existence of Khalifah mosques, graveyards and houses at Zubarah. We are accustomed to hear of the mosques and graveyards but, as you say yourself, the introduction of the word 'houses’ is new. As a matter of fact there are no houses at Zubarah that I know of, so I can only guess at what Shaikh Salman was driving at. I think he was trying to establish that he had some property there, but as that aspect of the case has been pressed for so long, and as both p.C.L. and the shaikh of Qatar wish to exclude areas with a religious connection from operations, and as there are no houses, no great harm should have been done. Quite how the shaikh of Qatar will link the matter up with the final phrase of the first sentence of article 1 of the Concession I do not know. The Shaikh of Qatar is sure to hear of it, but I don't think it should be of great significance particularly in view of his expecta tions of early oil production. Were he to take the matter up with you I hope you would be able to avoid any suggestion of urgent need having arisen. 4. From the Bahrain point of view, you have certainly succeeded in clearing the air and we now have it in writing, though I, and I dare say other political Agents, had it verbally that the Shaikh of Bahrain would place no hindrance in the way of imports and exports for P.C.L. Since he gets a fat income from these he scores both ways. His object will be now, I guess, having cleared the air as regards P.C.L. to drive ahead with his claim for Zubarah. This has been coming for some time and so, on the whole, I think your recent nego tiations are for the best, and I hope that the Shaikh of Qatar does not cut up rough. 5. I see that you have marked your letter personal and Confidential and so I am neither filing it nor this reply, but will you please let me have a brief note of the events for official record? Yours sincerely,Translation Sulman bin Hamad Alkhalifah, Buler of Bahrain. No.^74/1366 Dated 27/3/1366 c/t. 18th Feb. 1947. To Mr. Smith, Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer, Bahrain.

U f v ?e were informed by Mr. Alcard of Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., on Thursday the 28th of August 1947 that the nakhoda of a Bahrain water boat employed by them for our account and running between Muharraq and Zekrit had been fired on by a Qatari guard when attempting to go alongside the pier at Zekrit after dark. A cable was immediately despatched to prevent a recurrence and instructions given for an enquiry to be made. We have today received a report with the follow ing findings: 1. The water boat in question was leaving for Bahrain without undergoing the usual Customs inspection. 2. The Qatari guard called the boat back and the crew refused to obey and it is alleged bad language was used towards the guard who, as a result, fired in the air which action made the boat return to the jetty. 3. The boat was searched and as nothing was found was allowed to leave. 4. The Qatar guards, supplied by the Shaikh of Qatar, have no instructions to use their rifles under any pretext.• • • 2 o/Lsn/5109 (contd. ) 5. The guard reported the incident to the Customs Officer, Zekrit, who omitted to inform the Fields Manager or the Security Officer. The nakhodas have since complained to H.H. Shaikh Salman who informed me through Mr. Narayan, the Secretary to the Adviser. A reply was given verbally that action had already been taken and that a recurrence would not occur. vje now propose to acquaint H.H. of the above facts, which do not agree with the report first made to Cray Mackenzie. We are also addressing a letter to the Shaikh of 0,atar on the subject and are asking him to take strong action with the guards concerned and to take steps to prevent a recurrence.

Dear Sir, We have been informed by our Qatar Office that one Mohamed Rashid, nokhoda of the water dhow No.BN-1287? and Abdulla bin Ahmed, a khalasi, both Bahreinis, are being deported by H.E. the Ruler of Qatar as a result of an incident in which a dagger was drawn by the nokhoda consequent upon a heated argument that ensued between these two men and the armed guards on their usual routine inspection at Zekrit, when the latter rightly objected to the dhow creeping rather suspiciously alongside one of the barges loaded with materials, instead of return ing to Bahrein after delivering the water. This case, we are informed, has been investigated by our Liaison Officer. Under instructions from H.E. the Ruler of Qatar these two men have been sent to Dohah on the morning of the 14th June for deportation and the Ruler is expected to make formal representation to the Bahrein authorities in due course. In the meantime, we pass on this information to keep you au fait in case the matter is brought before you.

The principle correspondents are: the Political Agent at Bahrain; Sir Charles Belgrave, Advisor to the Government of Bahrain; Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad Al Khalifa [Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah], ruler of Bahrain; Shaikh Abdulla bin Qasim Al-Thani [‘Abdullāh bin Qāsim Āl Thānī], ruler of Qatar; and representatives (usually Ernest Vincent Packer) of Petroleum Concessions Limited (hereafter, the company) and its subsidiary, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited.The matters covered by the file are mostly founded on the rival historic claims to the old settlement of Zubarah. They are as follows:the need to settle normal relations between the two countries, partly driven by the clarity needed to define oil concessions;the company's attempts to buy land in Manama which lead to conditions imposed by the ruler of Bahrain concerning mosques, tombs and properties in Zubarah that are claimed by the Āl Khalīfah family;disagreements over the company's use of the port of Sitra in Bahrain, and what they are permitted to import and export;a meeting held between Packer and Shaikh Salmān on 15 February 1947 to settle these issues;incidences of violence and conflict between Bahraini seamen employed by the company and Qatari guards at Zekrit during 1947 and 1948;the refusal by Qatari authorities to allow Shaikh Shafi bin Salim, head of the Bani Hajir tribe, and his four sons to land at Zekrit in July 1948.Folios 43-45 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Qatar Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sitra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zekrit</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00013a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
