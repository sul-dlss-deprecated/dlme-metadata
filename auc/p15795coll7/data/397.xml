She also gives an account of attending the protests at Tahrir Square for several days, noting the sense of familiarity due to the presence of AUC community members and the location near the old campus, as well as concerns over reports about snipers shooting from the roofs of AUC buildings.  ###### gives her observations on the role of the news media and social media, and tells about how the curfew and the closure of the university affected her.  She discusses the effect of the revolution on AUC, including making students and other community members more politically aware and vocal about their rights, and how this influenced her teaching.  ###### describes the demonstrations against the military and Muslim Brotherhood that took place after February 2011, including their limited impact, lack of direction, smaller numbers of attendees and generally reduced public interest.  She relates her own participation in demonstrations like the one held for International Womenâ€™s Day in 2011 and other protests against sexual harassment, and speaks about the political campaigns, elections, and referenda that took place.</dc:description><dc:coverage>New Cairo; Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:date>2013-04-08</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>20130408</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
