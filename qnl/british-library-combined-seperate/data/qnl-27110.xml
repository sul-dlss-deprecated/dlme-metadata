Following this is the instruction to send surplus cash at Bushire to Basra in case the Khan turns hostile to the Company. There is approval for the purchase of a boat to carry correspondence between the Agency and the Residency, but disapproval sending the linguist to Yezd with so much of the Company's cloth during these dangerous times. It is explained that the Agent cannot authorise the Resident's pay rise, but he will put the case to the Presidency.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189854.0x000196#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
