I am asking him to try and narrow the gap.

I consider that we ought to ask the Shaikh to submit a formal claim for compensation for the share of the garden of which he was deprived. If we satisfy this claim we shall not of course have to pay anything further for the garden under the proposals contained in my demi-official letter No C/68, dated the 20th March 1947, except in respect of the one-sixth share which the Shaikh did not lose by litigation.

We are attracted by the prospect of one day not having to concern ourselves in detail with the difficulties continually encountered by the Sheikh in respect of these date gardens. We share your doubt, however, whether the Treasury would accept the fairly stiff price which it would probably be necessary to offer the Sheikh in return for his agreement to release us from thepledge given in 1914 By His Majesty’s Government. u We see no harm however in asking Hay to put | forward concrete proposals embodying the best terms which he thinks would be accepted-by the Sheikh. It understood of course that nothing would be said for the present to the Sheikh on the subject. '■ T ' E.P. Donaldson, Esq.., India Office.Ext. 741/47 736/47 753/47 4^. ^r% DATE GARDENS OF THE SHEIKH OF KOWEIT SITUATED IN L- 9 for the recent history of this complicated case attention is invited to the notes Ext.6575/43, Ext. 5660/46 and Ext. 6967/46 (flagged). The Sheikh of Koweit owns a number of date gardens situated in IraJ|. The gardens are the subject of a British guarantee given in 1914 to Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit:- 'That your gardens which are now in your possession viz., the date gardens situated between £ho and Qurnah, shall remain in your possession, and in possession of your descendants, without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes'. Since Iralj became fully independent H.M.G. has found it increasingly difficult to safeguard the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit under the terms of this guarantee. The IraJf Government have exerted a continuous and remorseless pressure against the Sheikh of Koweit in an effort to squeeze him out. In 1932 the Ira|| Government introduced a new system of indirect taxation (The Istihlak Tax), and H.M.G. were compelled to implement its guarantee by compensating the Sheikh of Koweit for the financial loss which he suffered as a result of this tax. In return for a lump sum payment of £22, 000 the Sheikh agreed to release H.M.G. from any further liability in respect of any losses suffered as a result of the Istfcklak Tax since its imposition in 1932, and^ar^y further losses arising from this tax or any other tax on land or produce^ might be levied thereafter. Even after this part discharge from our 1914 guarantee we still remain pledged to the Sheikh in respect of A 1&amp;ntinued possession of his date gardens. It further follows that the Sheikh will have a just claim to compensation if he has at any time dispossessed any part of his l&amp;asefcs in Irafy. The situation has now arisen in which as a result of prolonged litigation in the Irai| Courts, and through no fault of his own, the Sheikh has in fact lost possession of a garden known as the Bashiyah Garden. The Sheikh*s share (amounting to 5/6ths of the whole garden) has been auctioned by the Irsu£ Government, and the Sheikh has been forced to buy back the property through an IraJji subject put up to bid for him. In the light of this situation the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf now submits two proposals 1. It is submitted that we are under a clear liability to compensate the Sheikh of Koweit not only for the actual cost of buying back the Bashiya h Garden , but also for the expense incurred in litigation. We know that the purchase price paid by the Sheikh amounts to I.D. 8399/404, and the total extent of his losses is, therefore, expected to be in the region of £10,000. The Sheikh has not so far made any direct request for compensation, but the Political Resident proposes that we should show our readiness to honour our obligation by inviting the Sheikh to submit a formal claim for consideration by H.M.G. 2. The second proposal put forward by the Political Resident relates to the of , 01 ^ guarantee. He suggests that the time has come when we should seek to be discharged from the remaining obligations contained in the guarantee, and that we might approach the Sheikh with an offer of a lump sum assessed at say fifty per cent of the value of the remaining gardens. The Political Resident is willing to make concrete proposals along these lines if required. I suggest that we might support both these proposals, and consider them separately as below:-1 • The Foreign Office sind the Treasury have been kept in touch with the developments regarding the Bashiyah date garden case, and it has been generally admitted that the Sheikh will have some claim to compensation under the terms of the British guarantee. Some indication of the Treasury’s view may be gathered from the letter at Flag A in the file attached. The argument advanced in para, 3 of this letter would seem to have no foundation now that the Sheikh has repurchased his property. We have no precise details of the cost of litigation incurred by the Sheikh, and in these circumstances there seems reason to support the Resident’s proposal that the Sheikh should himself submit a formal claim to compensation. 2. The Resident’s second proposal is an entirely new development. The cost involved is likely to be considerable, and the Treasury may be reluctant to support the Resident’s suggestion. Nevertheless, there seems good argument for the proposition that the course indicated would in the long run be cheaper for ^•Opor all practical purposes H.M.G. hatt*nof effective means of fulfilling the obligation given.in 1914. It is clear that the Iral| Government intend to the present situation whereby the Sheikh is being forced to resort to endless litigation in Irajj Courts (under conditions of extreme difficulty) in an effort to maintain his rights. See, for instance, the present situation with regard to the Fao garden. It seems more than likely that H.M.G. may be faced with a series of situations in which we shall be called upon to pay compensation to the Sheikh, and this piecemeal compensation will mean that we shall be paying each time for the Sheikh’s costs in litigation. Moreover, there is nothing conclusive about the results of such litigationy. £ven now, for instance, the present position with regard to the ownership of the Bashiyah garden is far from satisfactory. The Sheikh is at the mercy of an Iraljl subject, and it is conceivable that at some future date another attempt may be made to dispossess the Sheikh of this same property. A settlement on the lines suggested by the Political Resident would also, of course, mean a considerable saving in the administrative machinery required to watch over the Sheikh's interests in respect of these date gardens. Without comnitting ourselves on this matter, it does at least seem that the Resident's proposal is one which deserves examination, and there seems no reason why he should not be asked to make concrete proposals for consideration by H.M.G.

(2) In 1943 the tenants, incited by a lawyer Sulaiman Shmwaf, refused to surrender the Shaikh's share; but after much pressure a commission was appointed to assess the crop. By then most of the dates had in any case already been made away with; and the Abul Khasib judge, by refusing to recognise the Shaikh as representing the heirs of Shaikh Jabir, the legal owners of the property, succeeded in thwarting his efforts to secure even the share allowed him by the assessors. (3) In 1944 the estate was registered by the band Settlement Cohrt as the property of the Shaikh, but nevertheless the tenants again succeeded in depriving the Shaikh of his rights. (4) In 1945 tne Shaikh managed to secure his share of such part of the crop as was produced within the jurisdiction of the Basra Court (less thgn half) by an attachment order. (5) In 1946 this attachment order was suddenly cancelled (by the same judge, it la understood, who made it. and on grounds of the doubtful meaning of a phrase in the text)• It appears to be generally believed that the judge was either bribed or acting under some other extra-judicial influence. The Shaikh's lawyers have stated that he has been given another appointment with higher pay. ( 6 ) There seems to be no method by which the Shaikh can secure in 1947 the proprietor's share which he enjoyed uninterruptedly up to 1942, and that in spite of the fact that the land was legally registered in 1944 as the property of the heirs of bhaikh Jabir (whom he represents).

After com Jt /liments. i e enclose herewith in ori cine 1 e letter received by us from our lawyers, Suleiman Faidhi and JAmil adiq, for your information re arding whot is mentioned therein about the law suits concerning our property in Iraq. *e request His Majesty’s Govenuuent to intervene in this matter and settle these law suits which hi ve been pending for many years. We believe that you will not acquiesce in such deliberate obstructions brought about by certain individuals in Iraq for the purpose of adversely affecting our relations with the Iraqi Govern ment. In these circumstances we fear that no lawyers in Iraq will in future, agree to represent us in our law suits as long as such deliberate obstruction takes place. v ; e have every hope ohat His I ajesty’s Government will take action and bring these matters to an end.I submit that I accepted to act lor your and all the &gt;ubaii family with ruy oollee -ue, the lawyer Jamil iadis^in the hope of carrying out our professional clut) to protect all your rights according to the principles of faithfulness, conscience, and professional honour in view of the confidence you placed in us. But it baoame clear to me that I was unable in spite of all my endeavours to protect your rights for the following reasona:- 1. You have adopted a method unpopular with landlords, in bhat instead of keeping guards on your property during the harvest to protect your proprietory share of the crop and to control ii#, you relied upon neglecting that method and appearing weak. You took refuge in the courts by (applying for) the precautionary attachment of your proprietory share every year, and by applying for sanction of ohe attachments as if the property had passed out of your hands or had been taken away from you by force and your control over it had been removed, This proceeding is not correct on the one hand, and on the other it encourages your opponents to continue their revolt against you and mnkeeyou appear before them and even before the courts to have little right and very little power. I hove advised you .many times to abandon this unfamiliar method and to keep control over your crops by means of guards os is the custom of all other landlords, but you have neglected my advice. I believe that the person who counselled you to adopt thia unusual method was not sincere in his advice. 2. By virtulre of my power of attorney and according to your advice of lest year I applied for precautionary attachment of your proprietory share nhere of the crop and after strenuous efforts and arguments with the judges succeeded in obtaining some orders for attachment of a part of the product^and 1 found it very difficult to obtain orders for the attachment of the remainder in spite of my references to higher authority on the subject and about the judge who was refusing. We then submitted applications for the sanction of the attachment, but they were delayed pending the decisions of the Land Settlement Court of Appeal. 3 3. We again appealed this year for the precautionary attachment of the proprietory share of your crops end we obtained 2f&gt; orders from the Basrah Court of First Instance and 120 orders from the Abulkheseeb Court of First Instance, end *hen applied for sanc tion of the attachment, but the Judge of the Basrah Court of First Instance, who had ordered last year , s attachments and had rejected the arguments of your opponents, changed his mind (for reasons un known to me) this year, and accepted the unsound arguments and passed a decree in defiance of the law for the removal of the attach ments. He was followed by the Judge of Abulkheseeb Court of the fr’irat Instance who passed a similar decree, and thus your opponents mad© away with all your crops. I filed a complaint against the above-mentioned judge (a copy was sent to you to refer to higher authorities) and I myself submitted it to the euthorlties concerned in Baghdad, i.e. the Prime Minister, I ininter of iteiioojftnd 6 ief Jua e of the Court of Appeal,with a verbal explanation, (a copy of tula complaint with full particulars was submitted to your Highness by me). Ay accusation was sent to His Fxoelienoy the Chief of of the Basrah Court of Appeal for Investigation and he submitted his findin s which I naturally could not sec. fhe result was that, instead of removing the said jud ; r,e for contravening the low, end for the losses suffered by you because of the action taken by him, he was rewarded by being iven a higher post cnu higher pay.zmo 4, During tlx© last two and half years, aboxt oases heve been filed by your opponents against you in the Land settlement Court of Appeal. But up to the time of writing the Court has not heard one of them In spite of my continual refercnoes to them and in spite of my submitting an application to the Ministry of Justice and ^•o &amp;he head of the Court of Appeal. In this application I ©sited that the oases may be heard, and pressed for their settlement either by the present Chief of whe settlement Court of ^ppe.l or by another jud^e, (a copy of this application was sent to your Highness for information). However the Ministry paid no attention to my request in addition to you (?) and 1 believe that these cases will not be settled for many years due to this situation. aoMKAinr The above-mentioned reasons together with other circumstances surrounding your affairs maKe me and my colleague find ourselves un able to protect your rights in spite of haring justice on your side, and our conscience will not be at ease unle s we carry out our duties faithfully. The wages paid to us^I.D.Suo/- per annum^hre attractive but our peace of mind is worth more than aoney in return for which we can do nothing to protect your rights. Therefore I and my colleague, withdraw from acting as your agents with effect from the 15th December 1946 with the request that you will accept our excuses. I also wish to assure your Hijhnesa that I shall always remain faithful to your Highness and your Highness family. I vd.ah to add that w© have prepared everything for the 2600 oases in the Settlement Court of Appeal and are nearly ready for whoever may taKe up the woric as our successors. Usual ending.1282 / 19/46 F7 British embassy, B agda d. (±j 23rd December, 1946 Sir, I as not altogether unprepared for your express letter M. No ( &gt;71-“S Q f hoven^ber 11th l»st concerning the Shaikh of Kowai^b r s^ date gardens at Basra. I had already learnt from His Majesty’s Consul General there that the Shaikh’s share of this year’s date crop had been lost to him by the manoueuvres of the tenants* lawyer and the matter was recently mentioned to the Counsellor of this Embassy by the Sheikh and Major Tendy. On his return to Basra Mr. Busk learnt from Judge Good that he had been instructed by the Iraqi Ministry of uustice to make an enquiry into the matter following a complaint from the Shaikh’s lawyer. 2. In his complaint to the Ministry of Justice the Shaikh’s lawyer alleged that the Judge, Andres Asher, who ordered the cancellation of the attachment order on the date crop, had been bribed. Judge Good has completed his investigation and has informed His Majesty’s Cons 1 General in strict confidence that while there are grave causes for suspicion of Andres Asher* s actions the allegations underlying the complaint cannot be proved. I understand that d udge Good has so reported to the Ministry of austice. The senior British Judge in Iraq has also followed this business and has informed Mr. Busk confidentially that though he agrees with Judge Good’s decision that nothing can be proved against Andres Asher, he is^rranging with the Minister for his transfer from BasraZ-fo ct i\ 3* I must confess that in these circumstances I see no action which I can usefully take. I fear that there is little or no hope of the Shaikh recovering the ID 15000/- which, it is estimated, he has lost. Even if an action at law against the Iraqi authorities had been possible I think that Judge Good’s report makes it clear that it would fail* Our efforts, it seems to me, must be directed to securing the Shaikh’s position for the future. I shall continue'to press the Ministry of Justice to have the appeals by the tenants against the Land Settlement decisions decided. And as I understand that a comparatively snail number of decisions will dispose of nearly all the 2764 cases I have hopes that the most unfortunate occurrence of this year will not be repeated. 4* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Political Agent at Kowait, His Majesty’s Consul General at Basra, to the External Affairs Department in hew Delhi and to the Foreign Office.

(SGD.) A.C .GALLONAY.Translation of a lettar dated the 6th October, 1946 from Shaikh Mohammed al Ahmed al Jabir asrSubah, Basrah, to His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait. Mutasarrif t „ „ r _ ■ rights to the present year*s crops at r’ao, Jfror ttre purpose of obtain ing the necessary orders from the court in this respect but he himself refused to render us any assistance in obtaining our rights to the dates of our property at Fao. Thus we were forced to communicate with the courts, in order to protect our rights, and the lawyers Sulaiman Faidhi and his partner arranged the cases and their executions by way of security and we seized by legs! authority all of our share of the dates at Fao through the Courts.at Basrah and Abulkheseeb. We appointed a third person, to protect the dates and we engaged guards and hired motor launches to patrol the river and we had arranged every thing to preserve our rights of the Fao crops this year. But Sulaiman Shawaf, the Ta 1 aba’s lawyer made certain arrangements with the Judge of Barrah, named Andres Ashu, and subnitted to him notices of protest against our seizures and asked the judge to remove the seizures. The aforementioned judge, Andres Ashu passec a judgment for the removal of all the seizures secured by us. in a way which is against justice and law from various points of view, as I was informed by haj Sulaiman Faidhi our lawyer who added that these violations of the law are as follows:- (i) bulaiman Shawaf, the lawyer does not hold a power of attorney from all the Ta * abas (farmers) but he submitted the notice of protest against the seizure on behalf of all of them, and his protests were accepted. This is a clear violence of the law, as Sulaiman Faidhi the lawyer says, (ii) The notices of protest should be submitted to tne Court by the defendants (those against whom the seizure according to law was/enoorerti j as their lawyer within a period of eight days only from the date of seizure, but the abovementioned judge has passed his decision for the removal of the seizure on the Fao dates after 50 days and this, according to Sulaiman Faidhi, is against the law. (iii) We, even had old debts i.e. our rights of the crops for the past years to be recovered from the Ta'aba, but this year we did not seize except our share of the dates which are our rights of the crops for the current year. We left the Ta’abas shares with them and did not interfere with them at all, because we were afraid that we might fail with our seizure. We submitted the legal securities and necessary guarantees to the Court against the value of the dates seized by way of security against possible loss which the Ta’aba may sustain in case we were found to be in the wrong in our seizure and in our case. We have done all this as a precaution as the lawyer Sulaiman Faidhi wanted it to be. ttu. cl \A^ Mutasarr asked theBut the &amp;bovernentioned Judge in jppl te preceutionary measures' taken by ua, passed a decree for the removal of the seizure on all the Fao dates dashing all our requests, which were suooorted by official documents, against the wall. We have thus failed in all our seizures which were filed in the Court of Basrah, and when the judge of Abulkhoslb Court saw the decree of the Judge of the Basrah Court of the First Instance for the removal of the seizure, he similarly issued a decision for the removal of the* seizure on the dates seized by the Coiirt of Abulkhesib and so the seizure is removed from all Fao dates and •were handed over to the ?a*aba and their lawyer Sulaim^an Shawaf. lour Highness is well aware that the decrees passed by the abovementloned judge (Andres Ashu) was according to Sulaiman Faidhi the lawyer against the law. I have discussed the matter with some other lawyer end askec them about the decision of this judge and they told me that trie decision of the judge for the removal of the seizure is quite clearl:/ against the law, but his agreement with SulaiiLc?n Shawaf made him come in our way and pass such a decision for the removal of the seizure. Haj Sulaiman Faidhi submitted several pro tests against the removal'of the seizure, but the above- mentioned judge paid no attention to our legal protests which are supported by documents, while he, the said judge, accepted protests of the lawyer Sulaiman Shawaf which were against law r and justice. The Courts of Basrah, the Government and the administration are all against us and against our law ful claims. They incline towards the Ta*aba side and Sulaiman Shawaf quite openly against us and there is no difference among the Courts in this respect. For example, the Settlement Court of Appeal which was detailed to see the cases, whether in favour of or against, was to be held on the 3rd October, 194G to see some cases between ourselves and the Talabas of Fao, and while our lawyer, Suleiman Faidhi was waiting to be asked to attend the Court, the Judge left the Court and did not see our cases and. thus they have been postponed and left for future reference and they have been neglected. This shows quite clearly that such postponements are done purposely against us, ard the delay an of our case is in favour of the Ta‘abas. The Courts here are post poning them from time to time without a reasonable excu/(se, but for the benefit of the defendants I referred the matter to the Chief Judge many times but he told me that these cases did not concern him.61 jpreola of piooeedlngs pi x»a«ard to the , c: Uiaiicli of Kuwait's Pete Oardta?

(Trsiislatioii of a letter dated the 7th tTure,! Shaikh Mohammad al Ahmed al Jabir As subah, ba the Shaikh of Kuwait•) I have tried for a long time and hav^dene my bea.tL_io avoid bothering you with any of the outstanding oases which are in the Court of Settlement and in other courts as well. I tried to settle these oases personelly, by using every possible method. I communioated repeatedly with the Courts and aaited that our cases should be heard, as they were very important, but they continued to hinder the progress of our oases by putting off and deferring the court sittings, rhis negligence I saw In all courts and by all judges In general. They have been postponing our cases from month to month and for long periods on various pretexts, without having any grounds for these postponements. Tour Highness is well aware that their sole purpose is to win time and give the farmers s chance to consume the dates of the Fao estate this seas# on, as they did in the previous years. As for Salman Ifeidhi, the lawyer, he does not care how long the case hangs fire, as ho gets his annual fees, and the del* ay of the oases by thf courts for a longer period Is in his fsvour, because he will continue to receive his annual fees from us. I have asked him several times to ask the court to fix the date for appeal and to try our cases. He goes to the judge and asks him to hear our cases, but the judge makes many excuses and postpones the cases from month to month. Moreover, the Judge appointed to hear our cases in the Court of Appeal of the Land Settlement is the acting Chief Judge of b asra Liwa and iu the same time he performs other duties. ?or example he performs the following duties 1. 2 . 3. 4. 5. Fe tries the oases of appeal of the Land settlement, for us and others. ’ He is a member of the Civil Court of Appeal. He Is © member of the High Criminal Court. He Is the Judge of the Court of Rationing. He goes on tour to Arnara and Naseriyia now and then and stays there for the purpose of hearing cases of High Criminal Court. Thus the Judge appointed to hear our cases is being kept busy with several duties and our cases will remain pending in the Courts forever. The Court ahaould have fixed certain dates to try our cases, which axe numerous, and pass the final judgement according to law and justice, whether in our favour or against and settle this problem* Salman Faidhi, the lawyer and myself believe that it is the Government of Iraq who are delaying and postponing our oases purposely by suggesting to the Courts to delay the cases for the purpose of causing loss and damage to us and enable the fanners (Taafca) to consume our dates and to mice us appear in the ©yes of the farmers as helpless and failures. On the other hand their intention in postponing our cases in the present time may be to gat the chance some day to ar^ash all our cases, (God foroid), and of this I am afraid. I have often communicated with Mr. Good, the Ch.ief Judge. He has always been kind and showed me a smiling face. He wishes to help us, but he can do nothing for our eases openly.

Of these, the Eao garden (which, it should be noted, is the most valuable and worth about £ 15,000/- per annum to the Shaikh at current prices) is the only one which is at present the subject of litigation. As a result of the litigation the Shaikh has not been able to obtain his dues from the Eao estate for the last three years* 3. The property was registered by the Land Settlement as belonging to 'the heirs of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah As Subah', the great-grand-father of the present shaikh, and this decision was notified in the Gazette in February, 1944. Shortly afterwards the tenants, instigated by a lawyer, Suleiman Shawwaf, who told them that the Iraq Government was anti-shaikh and would help them to secure his property, appealed against the Land Settlement decision. The appeals,- over 3,000 of them - are still pending and the executive authorities in Basra have been instructed not to enforce the payment of the Shaikh 1 s dues until the appeals are decided. Accordingly last year the shaikh applied to have his share of the produce attached, and this was done by the Basra Judge of the Court of the First Instance in respect of about half of the property which was held under tenancy agreements stipulating that disputes should be heard by the Basra Courts. The tenants later found a surety and the portion of the produce attached was released to them. The remainder of the produce was not attached as the Judge of /the3 the Court of First Instance, Abul Khasib, whose duty it was to make the order, refused to do so out of (I am informed)personal spite against the Subah# This year there is no Judge at Abul Khasib as the post is an unpopular one and officials nominated for it invariably find good reasons for not taking up the appointment. When the appeals are finally decided the Shaikh should sue his tenants for his share of the produce for 1943, 1944, 1945^and 1946. This, of course, would be a waste of time except possibly in regard to the produce attached last year and released against security. 4. There is another bone of contention at Fao. The Land Settlement, while registering the actual date gardens as Subah property, registered the uncultivated but cultivable mud flats between the gardens and the river as the property of the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior. Suleiman Shawwaf has succeeded in having this allotted to the Shaikh^ tenants for cultivation and it has actually been divided up among them, as soon as they have paid the lawyer and the Government their dues the tenants will be free to cultivate this area and, in doing so, will cause considerable harm to the Shaikh*s properties. Most, if not all, of this land has been deposited by the action of thf river since 1914 and is therefore not directly covered by our guarantee to Shaikh Mubarak. 5. A possible further complication is that the division of the property among the heirs off Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah As Subah and the Power of Attorney purporting to empower Shaikh Ahmed al Jabir to act on their behalf may be successfully challenged. This, hov/ever, has not yet occurred. 6. There is another date - garden about which there has been litigation, and in regard to which His Majesty’s Government’s obligations to the shaikh have not yet been fulfilled, it is the Bashiya garden forming part of the Faddaghiya estate, and, on the 4th May, 1944, the Shaikh’s appeal was rejected and 180 out of the 216 shares into which the garden is divided passed out of the Shaikh’s possession. The value of the property lost to His Highness and the cost of litigation has beencomputed at £ 10,000/- but compensation has not yet been tendered to the‘Shaikh. I understand that the Iraa Govern ment, intend to auction the 160 shares and that the shaikh will put up an Iraqi subject to bid for them. When bought they will become in fact the Shaikh’s property, and we shall know exactly the extent of the loss suffered by the Shaikh, apart from the expenses of litigation. 7. At present the Shaikh continues in peaceful enjoyment of his other properties. M.B. '© BRITISH K1BASSY, ,Nd £xbd i 70/fa/4 5 sm) Sir, With reference I iVi 757-S of llth^hXy','wlirg h^'we' receivad on 23rd July, I have the honour to sta'te that the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior of the Iraqi Government, ^r. Ditchburn, informs me that he has discussed the matter with the Mutasarrif of Basra, who said that he had received no complaints about the Sheikh’s troubles with his fellahin, either from his Qaimraqam or from Sheikh al Sabah, 2. Some time ago, Mr, Ditchburn says, the latter approached the futasarrif regarding the Land Settlement Officer’s decision, declaring plots 14 and 15 as rntri Irf in the name of the Ministry of Finance, but the Mutasarrif informed him that such appeals must be lodged with the Special £iand Court, 3. In Mr, Ditchburn’s opinion, the fact that no such appeal has been made by the Sheikh’s legal representatives indicates that they realize the weakness of their case. 4. In general Mr, Ditchburn says that the metavace system in Iraq is attended by many evils. Any trouble that the Sheikh may be experiencing with his fellahin is unfortunately of only too common occurrence. 5. The Kutasarrif has assured the Adviser that he will do all in his power to assist the Sheikh in every way possible whenever any complaints reach him.

The responsibility of your office for the maintenance of the status quo ante in the districts where settlement has been announced does not go beyond the definition of the state of affairs regarding the actual pos; ession of the lands at the tine when the declaration of settlement was made.

The announc ment of the settlement in the district does not affect the right of the landlord to refer this matter to the courts.

Acting on the advice of his lawyer, the Shaikh of Kuwait has compiled a new Inheritance document leaving out the names and the shares of Ali Kohanned A1 Dubah and Lulwa al Ghuneim. The reason for this step is that, as the Iraqi Courts have already passed a decree against both Ali Lohannied ^1 Subah and Lulwa al Ghuneim when they claimed ri pits in the Fao property, the inclusion of their names in the Inheritance Document would enable them to appeal against the previous decree, and obtain a' new judgement in their favour. 3.

Subject*- Shaikh’s Date Gardens a t Fao• Sir, I have the honour to refer to your endoree- ment No.539 -S of the 19th May, 1945, and to inform you that I discussed the position of the Fao date gardens with Shaikh Mohammad Ahmad in Basra on the 17th June and the following points emerged: The most immediate menace to the Shaikh’s enjoyment of his Fao gardens is the refusal of the administrative authorities to take action on complaints of theft or misappropriation lodged by the Shaikh against his tenants. The refusal is made on the grounds that, since the appeal of the tenants against the registration of the estate in the name of His Highness is pending, the question of the ownership of the gardens and produce is sub judlce. I submit that, in accordance with established legal procedure elsewhere, the status .jluo should be maintained during the currency of the case arid the Shaikh continue to receive his share of the produce as he has done for the last thirty years and more. As an example, a trans lation of a complaint, alleging theft and wilful damage against certain of the tenants, filed in the Court of the Qaim Maqam of Abul Khasib on the 27th May, 1945, is appended. No written answer was given to the Shaikh but he was verbally informed that the officials concerned had received orders from Baghdad prohibiting them from interfering between the Shaikh and his tenants. 2. It is improbable that the appeals will be disposed of by the time the present crop is harvested a ? d ] f^ th L action or * rather, inaction of the local administrative authorities is allowed to pass without a protest, it is certain that His Highness will lose his share of the entire date crop as he has done for the last two years.

Repeated to H.M. Ambassador, Baghdad* No. 484. Dated and received 14th May, 1945. Reference Shaikh f s date gardens at Fao. 2. His Highness informs me Iraq Ministrie of Finance and Interior have granted his tenants at Fao right to reclaim land from river where it adjoins his date gardens. He maintains that land reclaimed from river has always been considered property of owner of river bank--in this case himself—and that if peasants are given right to reclaim this land and occupy it in free hold results of reclamation of property will be disastrous. in writing to Mutessarif Basrah but was informed verbally that latter could do nothing ?and he should make immediate protest to Ministries of Finance and Interior. This His Highness^ now asks us to do. action of Ministries was clearly directed against Shaikh and that he and his subordinates had been ordered not to interfere in quarrels between Shaikh and his tenants. If this latter is true it will mean that Shaikh will see no more of 1945 harvest than he did of preceding two harvests. Mutessari^s position be safeguarded in respect of this dis closure. 3.

To The Hon'ble the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1945 I have the honour to invite a reference to my pre decessor’s telegram3 T a* 1S3 of the 5t’a liaxc h, 1944, and to say 'that His Highness states that he is both unable~and unwilling to produce a division of the Fao property betv;een the 'Heirs of Jabir bin Abdullah' who died in 1859. 2, Certain of the heirs were specifically excluded for consideration and their exclusion was recorded in writing. At my request in July, 1943, -vide Kuwait tele pram No. 501 the Land 'Settlement Board under the presidency of Judge Good took cognizance of. these documents and specifically excluded those heirs in the registration of the property. 3. It appears, however, that there are a number of other heirs who have been excluded without consideration by success ive Rulers in the exercise of their prerogative. Certain of these heirs are now resident in Zubair and are Iraqi subjects, and His Highness is apprehensive that they will be able successfully to claim shares in the property. ' 4. Failure to produce a division also involves His Highness in certain more immediate disabilities, because the Iraqi Courts will not take cognizance of a lawyer’s power of attorney unless it at least purports to be given by the heirs of Jabir bin Abdullah. This prevents His Highness from resorting to the Courts to safeguard his share of the produce of the Fao gardens against his tenants, who have apparently been disposing of His Highness’ share of the produce, 5. As His Majesty’s Government guaranteed Ghaikh Mubarak As- Subah and his descendents in the possession of the date gardens between Fao and Qurnah which were in his possession in 1914, it appears that His Majesty’s Government may ultimately have to compensate the present Ruler for any of the Fao gardens of which Shaikh Mubarak was in possession in 1914 that may be lost to any of the heirs of Jabir bin Abdullah who are not also heirs of Shaikh Mubarak. It is, therefore, in our interest that the present Ruler, or the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak, should secure as-much of the property as possible. 6. I understand from His Highness’ lawyer that there is nothing to be gained by His Highness appealing against regist ration in the name of 'Heirs of Jabir bin Abdullah' because he was given the chance before registration to produce a division of the property. 7. I can only suggest, therefore, that His Highness should now produce such a division as he is able and should defend it in the Courts. 8. Before giving this advice I should be glad to have your instructions.

(a) iou will recollect that originally i advised against a suit for the return of the purchase money and gave my reasons for doing so in my letter Bo.C/b4b-2/b of 4th October,1941. bater after consultation with hasrat al karisi in Baghdad i revised ray opinion and for the reasons stated in my telegram ho.C/203 of 2nd April,1943, was m favour of a suit oemg i lied, the case was heard in basrah in August and the verdict was given for the defendants, uuring my interview with Judge Good on Wednesday he regretted that they had been forced to give the decision against His Highness in Basrah and expressed the view that the Bhei&amp;h had no case. This statement was volunteered, and as i did not feel that 1 could properly question the Judge about a case which 1 gathered he had himself tried, i did not persue the matter. An appeal has been lodged in Baghdad bpt no date of hearing has yet been fixed. (b) m view of the Judge's statement and for the reasons given previously i have little hope that the case win succeed on appeal or on reference to the Court of Cassation should such a reference be pecessary and consider ed desirable. We should therefore be prepared to make a monetary payment to the Shaikh in condensation for his being dispossessed of property we had guaranteed should remain in his possession, in order to mitigate the feeling of chagrin which he will no doubt feel at our failure to fulfil our undertaking i consider that our monetary payment should be prompt and generous. it will be recalled that so far he has not made any request that the numerous sums expended by him on lawyers and in Court fees in fighting this long battle for the uashiyah should be in whole or in part met by His Majesty's Government. This point should in my opinion be taken into consideration in computing the sura to which he will be entitled. 1 suggest that steps be taken tow to ascertain the sum due to His Highness in the event of further adverse judicial verdicts. ' 1 The Hon # ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, Camp Bhiraz. 3./3. THE Jb ADD AG 11 AH CASE Sulaiman Shawwaf has made a reference to the Court of Cassation and Alii Murataz the Shaikh’s Baghdad advocate has put in a written reply. His Highness* case is a strong one and it is probable that the verdict will be favourable but by no means certain, nothing is in law. Should the verdict be favouraole a tiresome case will oe finished, should it be uni avcurable we shall have to work out and add up some very disturbing figures. 4. EAO . Judge u-ood informed me that he haddecided in His Htighness’ favdUr and that the decisions had been written and were being typed and would be made public as soon as the maps were received back from the Baghdad Survey Office. So far so good, but Ut remains to be seen whether the wording of the decisions leaves a loophole for the inter- rainaole law suits beloved of the asiatic. i fear it will. 0. The position at kao is not particularly satis factory for it 3'eems that Suiaiman shawwaf has been down there and has been inviting the fellaheen to confide their troubles to him. he is understood to have enlightened them with regard to their rights and the somewhat invidious position that the owner of the land must remain in until the estimate is actually registered in Tapu. He seems to have a friend in the employ of the kao Section of the Basrah Bort Directorate who keeps him informed of events. 6. As far as 1 can understand the position the fellaheen are now collecting the 'windfalls* and disposing of them without reference to the owner. The owner also fears that before the time of dividing the season’s coop they will have smuggled the majority of the dates across the Shatt-al-Arab. The owner normally has two judicial courses open to him. He can prosecute individual male factors if he can obtain reliable evidence or he can evict the erring tenant. The first course is expensive and tedious as it might be necessary to file several hundred cases which owing to the difficulty of obtaining evidence would not necessarily be decided in the owner’s favour. The second and most effective course is dangerous in the present circumstances as the estate not being registered a court might hold that His Highness had no right to evict any of the fellaheen. This interesting position has, 1 am informed, been made known to the fellaheen oy oulaiman Shawwaf. 7. There are non-judicial ways be which the Shaikh could safeguard his interests and one of them is by appoint ing watchmen to supervise the fellaheen. Shaikh Mohammad bin Ahmed, his highness 1 agent maintains that he has been unable to induce Iraqis to take on the work and conse quently His Highness decided to send some of his own subjects to Eao. unfortunately however Eao is a prescribed area under an Iraqi Defence Regulation and no foreigner may proceed there without a permit from the Mutessarifiyah. The Muttessarif has informed Shaikh Mohammad that he does not favour the grant of permits to Kuwait watchmen, very natural, as there probably would be some bickering and scwffling at kao before the watch men and the fellaheen saw eye to eye.8* i called at the Consulate-Cieneral to discuss the matter but discovered that Knight was on leave and Ootn Oldham and Wiltshire were out. As the time of their return was unpredicable and i had a great deal to do X asked the head clerk to acquaint the Consul with the facts oi the case and to tell him that l would instruct Shaikh Mohammad to call upon him and discuss the matter, x felt that possibly the Consulate-General could press the Mitessarif to help Shaikh Mohammad to find watchmen or in the alternative to direct the Mudir- al-^ahiyah at Kao to take an active interest in affairs and advise and induce the fellaheen to behave themselves, x also suggested to shaikh moharnmad that ;bhe should call on shoesmith the lort Director at xeA and acquaint him with the part his ernployeesma alleged to be playing and ask him to warn the individual if investigation showed the allegation to be true. lours sincerely, Sd.

The foreign Office however considered it advisable for the question of arbitration to be oarefuly studied before the sigh Comialcsioner was authorised to use it ixs a powerful persuasive and auggestca that the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown be sought.

It was decided that the Faddaghiyah case and any others that might be brought must be decayed until a solution to the whole problem could be found, and that to this end the Shaikh of Kuwait should refuse to accept letter 139 B/ 308 / 3 ervice of processes on the groun s that he was an 93 j/30.3.33. independent sovereign and therefore not subject to the jurisdiction of the Iraq Courts. At trie same time it was considered desirable that the &gt;haiKh should defend under protest the Faddaghiyah case and the Law Officers of the Crown were consulted on the whole '.uestion of the 1914 guarantee, 9. Vhile these decisions were being tauen i-he Shaikh of Kuwait’s Counsel in Basrah informeu him that unless a copy of the original Power of . ttorney granted to Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair authorising him to act on his wife’s behalf could be obtained from Constantinople then he considered the Shaikh’s position as regards the Faddaghiyah property as hopeless and advised him to compromise the case by paying £.5,000 to the plaintiff Abdullah nephew of.. Aisua, and her wwo Hhugnters who although resident in Constantinople had briefed Khan Bahadur Kirza Muhammad to watch on their behalf the judicial proceedings in Basrah. The compromise idea was not pursued and in August the Political Agent in Kuwait reported that a copy of the original power of attorney having been obtained by the Shaikh’s lawyer from Constantinople be considered that the suit could now safely be defended and sought the Hesident’s sanction to so Inform the Shaikh.

In Baghdad in 1'ay 1933 His Majesty King Feisal had been asked to intervene and it had been suggested that if he would do so then His Majesty’s Oovera^ent would probably be willing to compensate the Shaikh of Kuwait for P.1.3848 of 1333(para.8) P.^.4128/33 for future looses under the new Iraqi system of taxation. The King of Iraq said that he would ensure that the Shaiic would regain in possession of his late gardens.

All concerned were in ag. eement that time should be given for King Peisal to act and that even though the Shaikh’s lawyer in the Faddaghiyah case was now optimistic it was better for the case to be kept out of court and an attempt to s«• vv e the Shaiich by post s ' rustrated. It was perhaps as v/ell that this attitude was adopted for in October the foiltioal Agent Kuwait reported a serious defect in the power of attorney sufficient to invalidate the document.

Wote on an interview with His Majesty’s Consul, at Basra on the 14th December 1942. Mr. Weld-Forester showed me the Consulate file dealing with the Date Gardens case and the papers concerning the export of dates from Basra. He stated that at the behest of the Embassy enquiries had been made regarding the activities of the Shaikh and his Agent and the opinion of certain European firms who were interested was obtained as well as that of some of the local merchants; the replies were all to theeffect that undoubtedly the Shaikh’s dates were being smuggled out of the country. Mr. We Id-Fores ter stated that they had not meant to indicate in their telegram to Baghdad that His Highness was himself involved, i said that whatever had been inten ded the natural meaning of the telegram was that His Highness was himself involved or was at least aiding the smugglers. I informed Mr. Weld-Forester that 1 was quite convinced that His Highness had had no hand in smuggling but that it was more than probable that his fellahin had smuggled large quantities of dates abroad. His Highness had sold a percentageof his crop to the fellahin and held receipts. Mr. Weld-Forester said that on receipt of Political Resident’s telegram Ho.2364, dated the 15th flovemben 1942._ containing His Highness* assurance, he had made fiurther enquiries from local Iraqi owners and deiXfcrs and was interested to find that they were unanimous in their opinion that His Highness had had no hand in smuggling, and he had so telegraphed to Baghdad. Further he had ascertained that His Highness h$d ; stored at Fao the dates that he had always maintained were there and this information had been confirmed from independent sources.

I enclose copy of a letter dat ed 20th October, from the Assistant Port DirectorHfoT^e 1 d ForesterT~ copies of which I have already sent to the Political Hesident and the Political Agent at Kuwait. It will be seen that the last paragraph strongly supports the Sheikh’s claim both to the ownership of the property and to the right to collect rent. Meanwhile when Sheikh Mohamed 31-Sabah went on my advice to see the Mutasj(arrif, the latter said he would refer to the Mudir at Fao for further information. On October 36th Sheikh Mohaiaed wrote to say that he had not yet received a final reply from the Mutasarrif, who was then in 'Baghdad, but that he hoped to see him on his return. It is stated in the last paragraph of Nouri Said’s letter of June 13th, 1939, to Sir P. Newton that in the event of the Sheikh’s encountering any difficulties, he should make representations to the local authorities, and the implication in the whole letter is that diplomatic or consular channels should not be employed until all possibilities of obtaining satisfaction through local channels have been exhausted. I therefore do not propose to take any further action here for the present. Should, however, the Mutasarrif not give a satisfactory answer within the next fort night, I will approach him myself, my hands strengthened by Payne’s letter.

To The Hon^le the Political Resident^^ in the Persian Gulf, Cas^ Bahrain. Sir I_havo the honour to refer to telegram No .C/ 703, . . dated, the 27th Decamber, 1941, and ny TeTfcrarTrfo.HI?, dated the 23th August, 1942. 2. It now appears that the position in regard to the Fao estate as described in paragraph 2 of my telegram of the 27th of December, 1941, is hot correct as the statements of Abdul Jalil Partu, Kis Highness 1 late Attorney, on which that description was based were not accurate. The* case is in fact still before the IGth Land Board but, I understand, the President of the Board hopes to finish the case in two months 1 time. 3. The Fao estate comprises the original lands that belonged to His Highness 1 grandfather Shaikh Mubarak, a considerable area of land reclaimed from the river on the east side of the property, and a lesser area reclaimed from the waste lands to the west of the property. That the whole of the' original estate will be registered in His Highness 1 name there is little doubt, but the question of the reclaimed land Is a very serious one. On the river front this land is in places of considerable depth and is threaded by the water channels which passing from the river to the gardens behind form the sole means of communication between the gardens and the river and along which must pass the produce of the gardens during the date season and tne requirements of the cultivators at all times. Should these reclaimed lands not be registered in the name of the Shaikh they together with certain other adjacent properties not owned by the As Subah will completely encircle His Highness* estate. Naturally water rights and rights of way will be legally assigned to him but even so the position will be ideal from a mischief-makers point of view and it may well be that the 'Date Garden Case' will continue for many more years to be the bete noir of K.B.M’a Embassy in Baghaad and the Political Agency in Kuwait. 4. Reclaimed lands are normally planted by the owners oi the adjacent terciiory either by themselves or by their tenants ?/ith r/iaterials supplied by the owners so tliat after a lapse of time they become absorbed in the original estate and the owners thereof register the lands as part of their property ana p&amp;y such taxes and dues as may be leviable. Thus the 10th Land Board, would ordinarily register these reclaimed lands adjacent to His Highness * property, which have been brought into cultivation by His Higrmess* employees at His Highness* expense, in His Highness* name, but unfortunately His Highness is a foreigner and I understand that the Iraq law precludes the Land Boards from registering land/land of this nature in the name of a forei^pner thus tne President of the Board, should he proceed according to the la.w avid there is no reason to suppose he will not, will be forced bo dispossess the Shaikh and will havo to decide in whose name the land should be registered. No doubt his decision will be influenced by the case of Shaikh Khazal of Mohamaorah in which the Land Board awarded the reclaimed area to the tenants actually tilling the ground. Therefore unless some means can be devised of altering the law. we shall find the area of land between the Shaikh of Kuwait s estates and the river in the possession of and inhabited by His Highness 1 ex-tenants, for presumably they will no longer require to work for anyone but tnamaelves. a people ignorant and easily swayed by clever and unscrupulous persons. 5. That it is highly desirable that good relations witn His Highness and between Kuwait and Iraq should be maintained there can be no doubt nor can there be any reasonable ^ ^ the Land Board alienating a considerable conducive to the continuance of good relations either with His Highness now or between the two countries in the future, I am ignorant of the nrinf*ini a nrvl nyoi-vM +.Viz see if there is any possible legal way by which this unfortunate state of afiairs can be prevented. I fear it will be a fruitless task and that the only way will be for the Iraq Government to be moved to amend the law to enable an exception to oe made in His Highness* case and authorise the registration of the lands in his name. This will no doubt be a formidable and unpleasant task but troublesome though it may be it cannot compare with the tremendous amount of future incon venience which will be saved should it be brought to a successful conclusion.

Political Agent, Koweit reports that land board recently passed orders alienating from estate of Shaikh of Mohammerah certain areas of reclaimed land. It appears likely therefore that Iraqi Government have not instructed land board that the Shaikh of Koweit is covered by pledge mentioned in concluding clause of the amending law. The Consul-General, Basra could perhaps enquire from them if such instructions have been issued.If not issued, I request that Iraqi Government's attention he drawn urgently to the verhale undertaking given hy the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign on March 29, l Q 4l (c.f. desnatch No. 127 (310/12/41)^0 April 10,1941 to Foreign Office) and it he insisted on that the necessary instructions he issued immediately to the president oi the land hoard.23rd November, 1942. No.655 . URGKNT. My dear Minister, ' ^ As Your Excellency is probably aware, a special Land Settlement Committee is now working in the Basra Liwa on the settlement of the properties of the Shaikhs of Muhammerah and Koweit. 2. In 1Q41 a Law (No.26 of 1941) was enacted Amending the Land Settlement Law of 1938, which had the effect of inserting the word ‘'Iraqi” after the word 'individual” in clause 3 (c) of Article 10 of that Law. At the same time this Law provided that this amendment should not cover foreigners to whom the Iraqi Government had formerly undertaken to grant title within the Basra Liwa, and in a note to sir Kinahan Cornwallis No. 1176/ 1176/100/10247 of August 24th, 1941, the MinisteI r 'T 6 r Foreign Affairs - gave an ^assurance that this second provision was intended to cover the properties of the Shaikhs of Koweit and Muhammerah. 3. As I have mentioned above, land settlement is now being applied to the properties of these two Shaikhs, but from information which I have received it appears that the President of the Land Settlement Committee may not be aware of the intention of Article 1 (2) of Law No.26 of 1941. I accordingly request that Your Excellency will be so good as to cause instructions to be sent to him acquainting him with both the intention of this clause and the assurance given by His Excellency Al Saiyid Ali Jaudat in his letter to Sir Kinahan Cornwallis of August 24th, 1941.

As a result of these interrogations I am inclined to the belief that the market was in fact built by the Port, or rather Ooaster in his capacity as Dredging Superintendent, on land belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait outside the Port boundary as compen sation for the cutting of date palms to permit of the road leading from Kao Depot out to the desert road being straightened. This straightening process was, I confirm, carried out before the work on the Xeshla road was commenced. This seems to fit in with the statement made Shaikh Mohamed and it would appear that the structure &lt;ris undeniably the property of the Shaikh of Kuwait, who presumably has the fight to collect rental from users of it. ■h ie. x/i.

At discussion with Consul General Basra on 17th October, Political Agent Kuwait learnt that Andrew Seir &amp; Co. l&amp;eiA have dcld forward 1,850,000 cases to United Kingdom Food Controller, but are unable to purchase dates at a forward price which will show any profit and are therefore faced with a serious loss. It is understood that to force merchants to sell dates to Andrew &lt;Veir &amp; Company, Date Board have prohibited export of all jjiackable dates. 3. Andrew Weir informed Consul General that although they do not require Shaikh’s Fao dates which are of poor quality, they would object to relaxation of export prohibi tion owing to effect on other growers. 4. Kuwait dhows, v/aiting at Fao to load essential date supply for Aden, are held up and if export permit is not granted, sailing season will have passed and Shaikh will be left v/ith date crop on his hands. 5. as monopolists have never previously exercised any control over Fao crops, and to prevent serious loss to Shaikh, grateful if Date Board could be urgently moved to relax prohibition in respect of Shaikh’s Fao estate. - Britconsul.

' Af / 1 ' Position is that Date Association exercising their legal authority have prohibited export of all dates j cove red by monopoly including variety known as ,, SAYER ,, . Shaikh’s dates are '•SAYER ' 1 and therefore come under embargo e 2 . If exception v/ere made in his favour it would become impossible to resist appeals for similar exemptions from other influential persons and result would be that Date Association would be unable to meet their obligations to Andrew Weir and latter would be unable to supply quantity required by Food Controller in the United Kingdom. 3. If Shaikh will not sell to .undrew weir at concession price he should have no difficulty in disposing of dates in Iraq at good price in view of keen local demand. r 7u A A- J * . I - Thompson.

Holt, who is the Oriental Secretary in Bagdad, and the only person who has any idea of what is going on, at once saw the danger and asked the Counsellor, Holman, to take up the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs* Apparently in the Foreign Office when you are under orders of transfer you cease to take up any more sork, so the Ambassador was unable I - 'Welt* to deal with it himself* Holt was pressed by Holman to get the amendment cancelled, and ascertained privately that the addition empowering the Iraq Government to make grants was being drafted in the Ministry of Justice* 3* When Holman approached the Minister for Foreign Affairs the latuer told him that the Shaikh's position would be fully protected, but when Holman asked him for confirmation of this ^ /in R*?.Peel Esquire, C*B*E*,M.C., The India Office, London*in writing he said this was quite unnecessary and that he would guarantee it himself• Holman retired with this answer which was, of course, quite worthless and did not even send a record of their conversation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs which might have the effect of tying him down* i told Holman that Taufiq Suwaidi*s undertaking was worthless and that it was a great pity that there was nothing in writing* He said 'Yea, yes, too bad of him wasn’t it V Too bad, too bad.' 4. I do not think that we shall ever get the Shaikh’s properties registered now, and am afraid we will eventually be forced to pay a very large sum in compensation* How the Embassy could have been totally Ignorant of such vital legisla tion passes my apprehension* I am sending a copy of this letter to Caroe and toFILE COPY r o p. 1714 ,9 4 i Allotted to Political Depar^meno , ^ ^ Co p iea Circulated . &amp; SECRET 4669, From Dated Received DECYPHSR OF TELSGR A, K .

XXX Addressed to India Office repeated to Government of India Its Majesty's Representative, Baghdad, Political Agent, Koweit. Galloway had received information that Iraq was introducing legislation to prevent foreigners acquiring landed property in Iraq which would preclude registration of Sheikh’s date gardens and nullify settlement operations. Enquiry from Embassy shows that Land Settlement Law No.50 of 1932 Article 10 Section (c) &lt;*.o sub-section (l) is being amended by insertion of word 'Iraqi' between first two words (? with the) declared intention of preventing registration of land in name of foreigners in Basra Liwa» 2. ,Enactment was apparently at Committee stage and as a result of representations to Iraq Government addition is as providing that ”(? the) limitation does not include foreigners to whom the Government has REC*.

Hven if Minister remains ii power and admits having given undertaking, Irac* Government could repudiate it at will by saying that it was unauthorised. I do not think slightest reliance car be p3,aced on verbal assurances, more especially in view of history of the case (? and would) urge that v^ritten undertaking be obtained at the earliest possible moment.

Judge Good has agreed to accept this appointment. 3. Disadvantages of this arrangement seem to be:- (l) Good’s lack of experience in settlement work; (2) Fact that if Good is Settlement Officer he will presumably not be able to preside over the Special Court in manner envisaged in paragraph 10 of Embassy letter to Minister for Foreign Affairs No. 3A7 of 8th July, 1936.

(b) The information in the enclosure was indirectly obtained from the police, and it is unlikely that commonierftions or payments could be made, even through a lawyer, without the knowledge of the police, and the risk involved in objection (a). (c) Owing to the Iranian exchange laws and the present exchange position, the heirs will almost certainly wish to obtain payment abroad in a manner that will obviate pressure by the Iranian Government to oblige them to remit to Iran. The situation in this respect has become more acute since paragraph 8 of Sir H. Seymour’s despatch Ho. 540 of the 25th December 1936 wete written. /a.

S.W.l. 27th April. 1940. Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to request you to invite the attention of the Lords commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to the question of the execution of the pledges given by His Majesty's Government in 1914 to Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah,by which they and their heirs and successors were promised tax-free possession of the estates of the two Sheikhs in what is now Iraq. 2, Their Lordships will recall that in 1936 His Majesty's Charg4 d'Affaires at Bagdad addressed to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs a note in which suggestions were made for a comprehensive solution of this difficult question. The proposals of His Majesty's Government were, in brief, that they would make no further claim against the Iraqi Government for the exemption of the properties of the two Sheikhs from taxation in Iraq, provided that the Iraqi Government would for their part (a) give a satisfactory undertaking to make no claim for arrears of (direct) taxation against either Sheikh in respect of their properties in Iraq, and (b) provide a satisfactory assurance that no disciminatory taxation would be imposed upon the properties of either in future. As an integral part of this settlement it was further proposed/ Kin 17 ? MAV 40.40 The Secretary to the Treasury. ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER No. 17 ^3 MAY 1940 FROM SECRETARY, POLFHCAL DEFT. INDIA OFFICE'2-®( proposed that all uncertainties should be removed in regard to the boundaries of the Sheikhs' lands in Iraq and a formal title be awarded to them through the application by a British official of land settlement to the areas in which the lands are situated. It was added that His Majesty 1 s Government were prepared to abide by the decisions of the land settlement officer as to the boundaries of the lands in question and by any modifications of those decisions which might result from subsequent appeals to the special court provided by the law; and that they were further prepared to undertake not to make any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of any changes which might result to the present boundaries of the Sheikhs’ lands in consequence of the land settlement procedure. In addition, His Majesty’s Government were prepared (although the Iraqi Government were not specifically informed to that effect) themselves to compensate the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak and Sheikh Khazal for the losses which they had suffered in the past, and wonId suffer in the future, in consequence of the introduction by the Iraqi Government in 1932 of a new system of indirect taxation (the Istiklak tax), 3. No progress had, however, been made in these negotiations by the end of 1937 and in the Treasury letter S. 32453/14 of the 10th January, 1938 it was stated that in the circumstances Their Lordships agreed in principle that no further attempt should be made at that stage to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Iraqi Government, and that negotiations could be opened with the present Sheikh of Koweit and with the heirs of Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, with a view to obtaining from them, in return for lump sum payments, written acknowledgments releasing His Majesty’s Government//'“N Government from any further liability in respect of any losses suffered as a result of the Istihlak tax since its imposition in 1932 and any future losses arising from that tax or any other tax on land or produce that might be levied thereafter^ It was at the same time stated that the question of the amount of compensation to be offered and any other subsidiary matters arising out of this decision could be dealt with by informal discussions between the departments concernedo 4. After preliminary enquiries into the questions of detail involved- an interdepartmental meeting was held at the Foreign Office on the 21st April* ]938o At this meeting it was decided that His Majesty’s Government could accept the figure submitted by the Sheikh of Koweit for the losses suffered in respect of the istihlak tax from the years 1932/3 to 1936/7, and that this provided a satisfactory basis for calculating the amount of compensation due to him and to the other heirs of Sheikh Mubarako The method of calculation adopted in this case was to strike an average for the years mentioned above (£1*037) and to multiply this figure by twenty so as to give the Sheikh and the other heirs a sum equal to twenty years 7 losses in respect of the future. The figure reached in this way was rounded up to £22,000. It was also decided that the heirs should be paid past proved losses for the seven years since 1932. 5. On the other hand, it was not considered possible for Eis ilajesty* s Government to accept similar figures for losses due to the Istihlak tax submitted by the administrator of the estates of Sheikh Khazalo Nor was it found possible to devise any '-leans of reaching a satisfactory estimate of what these losses had in fact been Q His Majesty’s Government felt/felt justified, however, in concluding from the estimates for the now abolished Land Tax made annually by the authorities in Iraq on the estates both of the Sheikh of Koweit and of Sheikh Khazal in the years preceding 1932 that the income from the latter was then, and might reasonably be supposed to have remained, a little less than one-half of that from the former-, it was realised that this was a method of estimating the losses on the Mohammerah estates which might not be acceptable in a court of law, but this was not regarded as a matter in which it was essential for legal forms to be strictly followed, provided that His Majesty's Government were themselves satisfied that the heirs of Sheikh Khazal were not being treated unfairly, in tne case of the Sheikh of Koweit His Majesty’s Government had a legal obligation, which is still in force, to a ruler whose good will is, incidentally, of considerable importance to them* The position with regard to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal is, however, rather different. The promise made by His Majesty's Government in 1914 was a promise to the Sheikh of Mohammerah m his capacity as an independent ruler, and was legally dependent on his continuing to be so 0 The Sheikh is now dead, and had indeed ceased to be an independent ruler before his death; and although His Majesty’s Government regard themselves notwithstanding as under a moral obligation to pay fair compensation to the heirs, this coxu^w m' v-. i S; i n their view, in effect an It was therefore thought unnecessary to negotiate with the heirs, and it was considered that their losses could justifiably be assumed without further investigation to be approximately half those of the heirs(£§) of the Sheikh of Koweitr The compensation to be paid to them was accordingly fixed upon the basis that it should be as Koweit, subject to certain modifications in the method of calculation which the absence of any agreed figure as to actual losses in respect of the Istihlak tax since 1932 rendered inevitable. The calculation was made as follows*, the assessed average annual loss on the estates of the Sheikh of Koweit from 1932/33 to 1936/37 (£1,087) was divided by two and the resultant figure multiplied by twenty-seven (twenty years in respect of future losses and seven years in respect of past losses since 1932) 0 6* Unfortunately, even when these principles had been laid down, the actual task of negotiating an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit and of effecting payment to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal proved both complicated and prolonged. In the first place, it was at that time thought desirable, in order to safeguard the position of the other heirs of the late Sheikh Mubarak, to pay compensation in respect of past losses only to the present Sheikh, the compensation in respect of future losses being paid to a family council, if such a body could be established. Moreover, the question was raised whether the 1914 pledge should be taken to cover all the properties administered by Sheikh Mubarak at the time. So far as the properties of Sheikh Khazal were concerned, the question of payment was greatly complicated by the multiplicity of the heirs. There are, besides one surviving widow, thirteen sons and sixteen daughters, some of whom are dead and whose rights in the property have passed to their descendants or to their collateral heirs, A basis for the distribution of the compensation among all these persons has, however, now been reached which meets nearly as possible half of that to be paid to the Sheikh of with/ /with the unofficial approval of the British judge at the Court of Basra. It has, moreover, now Been decided, in view of the objections of the Sheikh of Koweit, that it is not essential to insist upon the establishment of a family council, while on further examination it was considered reasonable to pay compensation in respect of all the properties administered in 1914 'by Sheikh Mubarak. All these enquiries, which involved research into questions of fact and Moslem law, have, however, necessarily taken a considerable time, and it has therefore only proved possible to authorise a definite approach to the Sheikh of Koweit in the last few days. Even now the heirs of Sheikh Khazal have not yet been informed of the amount of the compensation which will be paid to them on the signature by them of a suitable discharge, but it is hoped that this will prove possible in the immediate future. 7, In view of this delay, it has been considered unavoidable that the payment to be made to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal in respect of past losses should be increased by one year, i.e. from twenty—seven to twenty—eight times the assessed annual loss, or £15,218 in all. The figure to be paid to the Sheikh of Koweit has been increased in the same way by one further year's payment, in respect oi losses for the year 1959/1940, and in order to save further delay it has been decided not to require exact details of past losses in respect of those years for which such details are not already available, i.e. 1937/8, 1938/9 and 1939/40, but to pay compensation for these three years at the average rate of proved losses in the preceding years (£1,087). The compensation which will therefore be paid to the Sheikh of Koweit amounts to £8,696 in respect of losses from 1932 to the present time, and £22,000 in respect of future losses, /ordio) or £30,696 in all. 8. I am to request that Their Lordships may he moved to give their formal sanction to this expenditure, for which provision has heen made in Subhead L (Special Missions) of the Estimate for Diplomatic and Consular Services, 1940. 9. In conclusion I am to remind Their Lordships that, contrary to the expectations entertained in 1937 (see paragraph 3 above), the Iraqi Government have in fact accepted the proposals for a comprehensive settlement of the whole problem of the date gardens put forward by His Majesty’s Government in 1936. k translation of the note t on the subject to Sir Maurice Peterson from the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs was enclosed in the despatch from Bagdad of which a copy was sent to the Treasury with Foreign Office letter E 6676/28/93 of the 25th November, 1938. The Iraqi Government have, moreover, in fulfilment of the obligations which they thereby assumed, recently passed legislation writing off the outstanding claims in respect of arrears of direct taxation against the two Sheikhs, they have taken steps to apply land settlement to the area in which the properties are situated, and they have asked for the secondment of a suitable British official to undertake the necessary land settlement operations (see Bagdad despatch of which a copy was sent to the Treasury with Foreign Office letter E 1312/1148/93 of the 3rd April). 10.

TREASURY CHAMBERS, WHITEHALL, S.W.l 15th February, 1940 Dear Peel, With reference to your letter of 18th ultimo (P.Z. 102/40) about the Koweiti date gardens, I write to confirm the agreement given orally to Gibson on 26th ultimo to the proposal that the discharge could be signed by the Family Council, provided that the Sheikh was a member of the Council and signed as such. I note that you say that only the compensation for future taxation losses is to be paid to the Family Council. But I thought you held all along that the compensation for past losses should also be paid to the Council, and the latest communication to the Resident that we have - of 27th November last - still takes that line apparently. So far as I can trace the actual form of the draft discharge to be signed by the Council has not been sent to us until now, but the draft proposed by the Foreign Office, in Baggallay's letter of the 6th instant, which , )mutatis mutandis is on the lines of the draft discharge for the Sheikh's own signature only and has, I understand, been vetted by their legal people, would he quite satisfactory to us. If it is correct that the Sheikh should hinself get the compensation payment for past losses we should equally agree to the draft discharge for him as now revised by F.O. As i egercis the calcula.tion of losses in respect oi the past years which are at present undetermined, we should be willing to agree to the adoption of the average figure for the years 1932 to 1936. As regards the question of extending the past losses by those of a further year we are in complete accord with what Baggallay’s letter savs on that -nnint(E 274/110/93), FILE COPY r.z. '793 1 , i LiElOj' FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 6th February, 1940, Xv RCC*.FOt. bept: ; FEB'940 INDIA OFFICE Dear Peel, Your letter P.Z» 102/40 of 18th January about compensation for Istihlak taxation on the Koweiti date gardens. 2. As you were informed on the telephone, we for our part see no reason why the Family Council should not sign the discharge for any sums paid to them, so long as it is understood that in any case the discharge is signed by the Sheikh. 3. I see that the third paragraph of your letter proceeds on the basis that the Sheikh is entitled to compensation in respect of the year 1939, as well as for the periods agreed upon last year: that is the years 1932 to 1938, and twenty years purchase for future losses. It is certainly awkward to talk now about'•past' losses if we mean losses for the years 1932 and 1938, and ’’future' losses if we mean losses in respect of the years/ R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C2^ years after 1938# However, to increase the amount of compensation to he paid to the Sheikh because of the delay in reaching a final settlement with him, would seem to put a premium on the negotiations dragging on indefinitely, and in the suggested redrafts of the two discharges which I enclose, we have gone on the assumption that the amount to he paid, whether to the Sheikh or to the Family Council, will he the same as w r hen the matter was broached to him last year. If it is decided to throw in an extra yea^s payment, the drafts would of course have to he altered accordingly. 4. So far as we are concerned, we see no particular objection to your proposal that the losses for 1937 and 1938 (and 1939 too, if payment in respect of last year is sanctioned) should he calculated on the basis of the average for the years 1932 to 1936. In fact this seems to offer some advantages. Actual losses for the years 1937 and 1938 (or 1937-1939) might prove to he less than the average of 1932 to 1936, hut then they might prove to he greater (the Sheikh would have an interest in showing that they did) and, if they did, the question might then he raised whether £22,000 could he regarded as adequate compensation/HIcompensation for ’future 1 losses. To increase that amount would, however, not only he undesirable in itself, but would be awkward from the point of view of the Mohammerah heirs, since we have already fixed the amount to be paid to them, and since this is supposed to be, roughly speaking, half what will be paid to the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak. 5# Moreover, as you say, accepting an average will save a lot of trouble all round, and considerable delay. 6* You will remember that we calculated in this way the whole amount to be paid to the Mohammerah heirs, as it seemed impossible in their cases to get any satisfactory figures for actual losses in the years since 1932. 7. It would, of course, be a great simplification to drop the distinction between ’’past’' and 'future” losses, pay the whole amount to the Sheikh and get a receipt from him alone. I suppose, however, that the objections to that still stand. I am sending a copy of this letter to Wright ofCopy.

You will have seen that dated 18th November,1939. ) after careful consideration of tne point raised by Fowle it has been decided that it would be inadvisable to attempt a reassessment of the compensation to be paid to the Sheikh. The proposal already made to the Sheikh therefore still stands. 3. Will you accordingly, if you see no objection, please cake tne earliest favourable opportunity to press for the acceptance of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, in accordance with the instructions which were given to Fowle in our Express Letter of the 28th February before he raised, the question of a revision of the amount of compensation. These instructions require, however, one or two modifications in the light of the recent correspondence with the Treasury, namely:- (i; In place of the term ’’Mubarak’s heirs” reference snould be made to his ”heirs and successors”, since this pnrase seems to come nearer the meaning of the pledge.

The Sheikh has already been informed that His Majesty’s Government’s proposal is subject to two conditions, viz. (1) that payment shall be made to a Family Council which he should set up to represent the heirs and successors concerned, and (2) that he should give Kis Majesty’s Government a formal discharge for their liability for compensation for taxation losses both for those actually incurred up to the present and for those which may be experienced hereafter. The Sheikh has demurred to the first condition (vide Fowle’s telegram Ho.133 of the 14th March), but this condition has been considered essential in order to avoid any miscarriage of the payments. As regards the second condition the Sheikh should be required to sign a discharge of our liability on behalf not only of himself, his heirs and successors, but of the other heirs and successors of Sheikh Mubarak and/3 .

Dear Gihson, e^yioy, i^ill you please refer to Wright’s letter S. 32453/19 I o to you of the 10th November and your letter P.Z.7017/39 to me of the 14th November about the assessment of compensation for Istihlak taxation on the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens in Iraq? We agree that instructions may now be issued to the Political Resident on the lines set forth in the second sentence of paragraph 5 of Peel’s letter of the 31st October# We also agree to the alteration of the phrase ’’heirs” in the draft discharge to ’’heirs and successors”. We ourselves, in our despatch No# 524 to Bagdad of the 10th November about the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, used the phrase ’’heirs and assigns”. The truth is that it does not look as if any English phrase can be found that really quite meets the case. I am sending a copy of this letter to Wright.No. 524. (E 7137/39/93). ( FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 10th November, 1939 Sir Your Excellency will he aware that His Majesty 1 s Government have for some time had under consideration the question of granting compensation to the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah for the losses suffered by the heirs since 1932 on account of Istihlak taxation on the produce of the estates in Iraq of these two Sheikhs, the tax-free possession of which was guaranteed to them by His Majesty’s Government in 1914. 2 0 In the case of the Koweiti estates His Majesty’s Government have been able to accept the figures submitted by the present Sheikh for losses in the years 1932-3 to 1936-7. This provides a satisfactory basis for calculating the amount of compensation due to him and to his co-heirs. The method of calculation in this case has been to strike an average of the losses in the years mentioned above (£1,087) and to multiply this figure by twenty, so as to give the Sheikh and the other heirs twenty years’ purchase in respect of the future. The figure reached in this way has been rounded up to £22.000. It has also been decided that the heirs will be paid past proved losses for the seven years since 1932. The amount actually to be paid to them may, indeed, have to be slightly reduced owing to a /doubt His Excellency Sir Basil Newton, K.CoM.G., e.c. , etc., etc.. Bagdaddoubt having arisen as to whether the estates administered by Sheikh Mubarak in 1914 were all actually owned by him, and if it is established that they were not wholly owned by him it may be decided that the 1914 pledge only covers the estates of which he was the owner, as opposed to the administratoro No final decision on this point has yet been reached, but, whatever the decision is, it will not affect the estimated amount of the taxation losses on the Koweiti estates as a whole, although, as I have said above, it may lead to some reduction in the payment made to Sheikh Mubarak's heirs e 3e For the reasons given in Mr, OgiIvie-Forbes *s despatch No*390 (202/13/34) of 12th July, 1934, and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s despatch Noo499 (577/3/36) of the 7th October, 1936, it has not proved possible for His Majesty's Government to accept the similar figures for losses due to Istihlak taxation submitted by the administrator of the estates of Sheikh Khazal. Nor has it proved possible to devise any practicable means of reaching a satisfactory estimate of what these losses in fact have been. His Majesty's Government have, however, felt justified in concluding, from the estimates for the now abolished land tax made annually by the authorities in Iraq on the estates both of the Sheikh of Koweit and of Sheikh Khazal in the years preceding 1932, that the income from the latter was then,and may reasonably be assumed to have remained, a little less than half of that from the formerc 4° I realise that this is a method of estimating the losses on the ^ ohammerah estates which might not be acceptable in a Court of Law, but I do not regard this asa matter in which it is essential for legal forms to he strictly followed, provided that His Majesty’s Government are themselves satisfied that the heirs of Sheikh Khazal are not being treated unfairly. In the case of the Sheikh of Kov/eit His Majesty’s Government have a legal obligation, which is still in force, to a ruler whose goodwill is, incidentally, of considerable importance to them. I am advised, however, that the position with regard to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal is rather different. The promise made by His Majesty's Government in 1914 was a promise to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in his capacity as an independent ruler, and was legally dependent on his continuing to be so? The Sheikh is now dead and had indeed ceased to be an independent ruler before his death; and although His Majesty’s Government regard themselves notwithstanding as under a moral obligation to pay fair compensation to the heirs this compensation is in their view in effect an ex gratia payment. They therefore think it unnecessary to negotiate with the heirs, and although it is no doubt desirabl to obtain if possible a complete discharge from each recipient in return for any payment made this is not strictly speaking essential and it might be sufficient in practice to secure a receipt only. 5. In all the circumstances, therefore, I feel that the losses of the heirs of Sheikh Khazal can justifiably be assumed without further investigation to be less than half of those of the heirs of the Sheikh of Koweit, and the compensation to be paid to them has accordingly been fixed upon the basis that it should be as nearly as possible exactly half, subject to certain modifications in the /methodmethod of calculation v/hich the aosence of any agreed figure as to actual losses in respect of Istihlak taxation since 1932 has rendered inevitaole a The calculation has 'been made as follows: the assessed average annual loss on the Koweiti estates from 1932/33 to 1936/37 (£1,08?) has been divided by 2 and the resultant figure has been multiplied by 27 (20 years in respect of future losses and 7 years in respect of past losses since 1932)-, The tooai reached in this way is 10o 0 e 6&lt;. In his despatch No® 6_I2 of 31st December 1936, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr reported that there were in all 20 recognised heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammeralu Of these 13 were sons and 14 v/ere daughters and there was one widow? Sir Archibald Clark Kerr added that all the sons and daughters are entitled without exception to movable property and to mulk and miri property also, the sons, however, receiving twice as much as the daughters? The widow is entitled to movable and m ulk property, but so far as mlrj property is concerned she is entitled to trees and buildings but not to landc He went on to explain that in Ottoman Law the division of property amongst the heirs should be made in the following manner; after the widow’s share of 1/8 of the movable and mrOk (immovable) property has been deducted, the remainder is split into 40 shares, of v/hich each son is entitled to two shares and each daughter to one share. This position was confirmed by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his despatch No .340 (133/17/36) of 25 th December, 1936o As I have explained above, His Majesty’s Government regard themselves as having a free hand in assessing and distributing che compensacion go be made to the heirs in view of its ex grati a nature, and I do not consider it necessarylol to make any attempt to estimate whether the widows share should he less than l/8« It will, I think, he quite sufficient if her share is fixed at £1,834« 6. 3-, or 1/8 of the compensation, (which may, however, he rounded up to £1,835) and if each of the sons receives £642. 0. 0. or 2/40 of the remainder and each daughter £321. 0. 0. or 1/40 of the remainder. 7. Subject therefore to any further observations which Your Excellency may wish to make, I shall he glad if you will now address a communication to each of the heirs, except Sheikh Ghassih, on the following lines. 8. You should start by saying that His Majesty^ Government are prepared to make an ex gratia payment in full and final settlement of past losses due to Istihlak taxation since 1932 and of prospective future losses from this or alternative forms of taxation on land or produce. You should then inform each one of the amount which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to pay as his or her share of the compensation due in respect of the estate as a whole, and should say that this payment will he made in each case if the heir concerned is willing to sign the following form of discharge; 'I do hereby acknowledge the receipt 'of the sum of £ , paid to me on behalf of His 5, Majesty ! s Government in the United Kingdom; and so far 'as my rights and interest in the estate of the late Sheikh 'Khazal of Mohammerah are concerned I accept this payment 'as a full settlement, binding equally on me and my heirs / 'and'and assigns 9 of any claims which, as a result of the pledge 'given to Sheikh Khazal of Hohammerah in 191h&gt; the heirs of 'Sheikh Khazal have made or may make upon His Majesty's 'Government in the United Kingdom for the losses which Sheikh 'Khazal or they have suffered since 1932, or v/hich they may 'suffer in the future, hy reason of the Istihlak or any 'other tax hitherto or hereafter levied on landed property 'or agricultural production in respect of lands which they 'hold in Iraq as heirs of Sheikh Khazal'. 9c As and when each heir signifies his willingness to sign this receipt, arrangements should he made for him to do so in return for a cheque for the amount concerned, or, in cases where it is preferred, a letter notifying him or her that payment will he made into a specified hank in Iraq, Persia or the United Kingdom. 10. As you: are aware. Sheikh Chassih has an English wife who is living with her children in destitution in this country. His Majesty's Government regard it as very desirable that Sheikh Chassih should, if possible, he brought to make provision for this family. In his case, therefore, instead of saying that the money will he paid to him on his completion of the discharge, you should inform him that His Majesty's Government are prepared to pay the amount in question, hut consider that it is his duty to make provision for his family in the United Kingdom. They trust therefore that he will agree to his share of the compensation being paid direct to Mrs. Gladys Chassih. If he declines to notify his agreement to this procedure you should report to me for further instructions* For your own information, His Majesty's /Government.... - 7^ ! Government may in that event decide to retain the money indefinitely or to pay it to Mrs* Chassih without Sheikh ChassiVs express consent. This is, however, a point on which no decision has yet been taken,, 11, It is possible that some of the heirs are resident in Persia, and you should in any such cases consult with His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran, to whom a copy of this despatch is being sent, as to the best method of communicating with them, 12c In conclusion, I would draw attention to my despatch No, 134 of the 9th March in which Sir Maurice Peterson was instructed to inform the Iraqi Government, unofficially, of the intention of His Majesty’s Government to make a payment to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal on account of taxation lossesc I am not aware whether an opportunity has yet occurred of making the proposed communication, but in any case the Iraqi Government should be informed now of the sums that are being paid, I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)'rr'TI Telephone No. : Whitehall 1234.

Wright, Esq., Treasury, Y«hitehall, S.W.l. Will you please refer to your letter No. S.32452/18 of 12th July, regarding the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens. 2. Y.'e have had made a translation of the English version as: 'that your gardens which are now in your possession, viz. the date gardens situate between Fao and Q,urna shall remain in your possession or in 'Your gardens of date palms which are at this moment beneath the grasp of Your Honour, situate between Fao and Qurnah, shall remain in your control and the control of your successors without there being upon them anything of taxes and imposts'. phrase 'beneath the grasp' appears etymologically to imply property of which the Sheikh had entered into personal possession by right of ownership, but the phrase 'in .your control' appears to cover property * 1 NOV 1939 17 that portion of the Arabic version of the 1914 HLedge which is rendered in the possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts.” litcml The^ translation of the Arabic COP v AIR MAIL of words used is: (10337) Wt.l4054/P.164 10,000 5/89 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 over/over which the Sheikh or his successors exercised absolute control without necessarily enjoying personal ownership. The Arabic word which has been rendered as *’successors” is akhlaf (plural of khalaf). This means, in the i’irst place, ’’successors', and its cognate form 'khalf' is used in the Qur*an to mean 'succeeding generation' (of a community in a perfectly general sense.) 7/hen the word 'father' is expressly used (khalaf abThi) the word then comes to denote quite strictly 'son', in the sense that a son succeeds his father in the b't U.&lt;b&lt;.rry administration of his property. The who translated the Arabic for us, was not prepared to say whether in Mohammedan fcaw the term 'khalaf' can include descendants other than direct male issue, or political successors who are not necessarily related to the original owner. Incidentally we had better avoid using the terms 'heir' and 'non-heir', partly because they do not appear in either version of the 1914 pledge and oartly because according to Mohammedan law parents, grandparents and other elder relatives are entitled to share in an inheritance. Thus their use may obscure the issues. 3. It is quite possible that on the strict interpretation of the English version and to a lesser extent of the/the Arabic version of the 1914 pledge, the figure of £1,087, on the basis of which we have calculated the payment to be made to the Sheikh in respect of future taxation, may include taxation on some property which was not covered bji the pledge; e.g. property which, although controlled by ubarak and by tbd| present Sheikh, was not owned by Mubarak^ 1 On the other hand, the figure of £1,087 may conceivably not include taxation on some property which was covered by the pledge; e.g. property which was owned by Mubarak and which is now owned and controlled and on which taxation is paid by 'successors’' or 'descendants' of Mubarak other than the present Sheikh. 4. It seems clear that, partly by reason of the difference between the Arabic and English versions of the pledge, and partly owing to our ignorance of the precise legal position of some of the date gardens, any examination of the question how far the figure of £ 22,000 which has been offered to the Sheikh in compensation for«r 'vy \ \ . 4 as to the legal position of the gardens and &amp;Q7 the extent to which the application of the strict language of one or other version of the pledge would result in a revision of the figure of £22,000. It is unlikely that the Sheikh would he very forthcoming, and it is certain that the controversy v/hich would prohahly cJc arise round the points issue would make the conclusion of our negotiations with the Sheikh for the settlement of this tiresome dispute more difficult.^ In this connection you will rememher thht our plan is to g4-ve the Sheikh a take it H or leave it offer of a fixed sum, the amount of which we would refuse to discuss.

We are, however, ready, if you wish, and if the Foreign Office agree, to instruct the Political Resident that, if he thinly there is any foundation for a fear that the payment to the Sheikh of £22,000 in respect of future taxation might prejudice our freedom of action in the event of the Sheikh claiming, at some time in the future, compensation in respect of any loss of property which may not he sIriu'Lly covered by the strict language of the 1914 pledge, he should tell the Sheikh that it seems possible to us that the figure of £1,087, on the basis of which that of £22,000 has been reached, may possibly include taxation on some property which is not covered by the strict language of the pledge; but that, in the interests of an amicable and speedy settlement, we do not propose to go into this point in respect of compensation for future taxation. 6.

A literal rendering of the relevant paragraph would be:- ”Your gardens of date-palms which are at this moment b eneath t he grasp of your honour, situate between Fao and Qurnah, shall remain in your con trol and the contro l of your successors without their being upon them anything of taxes and imposts”. The phrase ’’beneath the grasp” appears etymologically to imply property of which the Sheikh had entered into personal possession by right of ownership, and would therefore seem to exclude any property over which the Sheikh exercised rights of control short of actual ownership. The phrase 'in your control” appears to have exactly the latter implication, that is, property over which the Sheikh or his successors exercised absolute control, without necessarily enjoying its personal ownership. In rendering both phrases by the word 'possession”, the official English version is inaccurate and misleading. I shall of course be very glad to be of any service to your department, in spite of my present translation to other spheres of activity.-zk 1 ^ ?: Department. A. J.

I wonder if, although you are no longer sitting in the India Office, you would agree to assist us in the matter in view of the fact that you have already seen the papers.

What it seems necessary that we should have is a translation of that passage in the\ A Arabic text which runs as follows in the English version: 'That your gardens which are now in your possession, viz. the date gardens situate between Eao and Qurnah^shall remain in your possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts'. It would also be useful if we could have some comments on the meaning of the word used in the Arabic text to trans late the word 'possession', indicating whether this Arabic word applies only to rr gardens in the ownership of the Sheikh or whether it can also be applied to gardens over which the Sheikh exercises some measure of control v^hich falls short of ownership . I realise that this last question is largely a legal one, but lawyers would no doubt derive great assistance from your notes on the etymology of the word.

As far as the etymology of the word goes, I would say that the Arabic akhlaf (plural of khalaf ) means, in the first place, successors : and its cognate form khalf is used in the Qur’an (7 168 ) to mean succeeding generation (of a community, in a perfectly general sense). When the word father is expressly used ( khalaf abihi ), the word then comes to denote, quite strictly, son : in the sense that a son succeeds his father in the administration of his property. The question which a lawyer would have to answer would therefore be (1) whether the term khalaf can include descendants other than direct male issue (3) whether it can include descendants other than related descendants, i.e. political successors. I see that in some of the previous papers the1 | 1 -'' • v.... „ , .w«» - -* r ~ ~ • A 1 r ^ x' ' 'gm: ^ N word heirs has been used in this connection. rse this is quite incorrect, as according to Mohammedan Law n parents, grandparents and other elder relatives are entitled to a share in an inheritance. -It might be interesting to know what was the Arabic original of the phrase 'your successors from among your male descendants', as perhaps the wording of the 'pledge' had reference to this. Yours sincerely,24 th July, 1939. ' 1 Dear Arberry, I wonder if I might enlist your help in a matter of Arabic scholarship? The point at issue - as you may see from the Treasury letter to Peel, S.32453/18, dated 12th July, 1939, at the top of this file - is the precise meaning of the word which is rendered ’'descendants' in the English translation of the pledge given by His Majesty’s Government to SheikhMubarak, dated 3rd November, 1914. According to Colonial Office letter of 11th October, 1929 (P.6513/29, flagged) the term is to be distinguished from successors and the Foreign Office take it to include only the actual heirs of the Sheikh’s body. (F.O. letter of 19th October, 1929 P.7846/29). In the pledge which was made to the Sheikh of Moharnmerah, however, the operative term is/ -J. Arberry, Esq., M.A., Litt.D.@) XI'S 2 . is the quite general term ”heirs” altheiugh there is also a reference to M your successors fran among your male descendants” in an earlier paragraph .4142/147* I have inserted flags in the relevant files which accompany this note and if you could help us to elucidate the question we should he most grateful. The view of this Department - 'which you will find stated in OdJ^on’s letter to Baggallay dated 10th June, 1939 (P.Z. 3445/39) - is that too strict an interpretation of the term ”heirs” should not he pressed and that it should he considered in close connection v/ith the Kov/eit system of family ownership and administration. Hov/ever, the terms 'descendants” and 'in possession of” may doubtless he considered separately. Yours sincerely,'- J 2 '7 4 r' ^ \^ « '•'* t •(. 9 ~'C From To &amp;O.K71.

Ihe Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Simla, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document gfri^ .Would you please refer to your letter of 10th ultimo, (P.Z.3445/39) to Baggallay about the compensation for the Sheikh of Kov/eit, and Colville* s letter to me of 23rd ultimo on the same subject (copy of which I suppose has gone to you)• \ We realize that there may be strong arguments for standing to what has already been said to the present Sheikh about the amount of the compensation, irrespective of the merits of the case, but we should like to size up the merits separately first. If a good case on merits can be made out, then we are saved the necessity of considering the always disagreeable question of acquiescence or not in the results of a mistake. ^ The question raised by Powle is primarily whether the word ’’descendants” in the English translation of the 1914 R.T.Peel Esq., M. C. , f — India Office. | KECd - POL. DER T . 13JUL1939 'NDIA OFFICEas 1914 pledge to Sheikh Mubarak covered 'non-heirs 1f well as 'heirs’ 1 , hut your letter appears to make the question primarily one of 'ownership or administration'. In your second and third paragraphs you refer to the basis on which the property was actually administered in 1914 and you contend that Mubarak would have regarded the pledge as covering not only the gardens owned by him personally but also those owned separately or in combina tion by his family but controlled and administered by him. Now that Mubarak himself is dead, his actual area of ownership or administration would appear to be no longer relevant but I take your contention to be that, if the 1914 pledge covered Mubarak’s area of administration as well as his area of actual ownership, so it should be regarded as covering also such area as is actually administered by the present heirs. That seems the most that could be claimed on that line of reasoning. I gather from your letter and its enclosures that the Fao estate is in xact administered by the present heirs just as it was by Sheik Mubarak in 1914. The share of the non heirs in the Farhaniyeh estate apparently is not, but you(Sh 277 say that estate is small and comparatively unimportant. Iv This point, i.e. whether the 1914 pledge covered gardens in the administration of Mubarak as well as those owned hy him, seems a primary one. The word used in the English translation of the plegfde is ’•possession 1 '. As there seems to he no talk in the file of reference hack heyond the translation to the Arabic original when points are in dispute, I take it that no copy of the original Arabic pledge was made or that it j/t now no longer extant. But as the/question is one of K compensation for tax liability, the incidence of the tax on the property owned by the non-heirs but administaed by the heirs should presumably be the guiding considera tion. It would seem to be implicit in any reasonable claim by the heirs for compensation in respect of the tax in past years on the property administered (but not owned) by them that they had in fact finally paid the tax on the administered property. Equally it should be implicit in the inclusion of compensation for the future in respect of the administered property that the heirs should continue to pay the tax on it. Alterna tively in either case the heirs should hand out to the.jAiTz^cra;'G , &gt; non-heirs the proportionate share of the latter in the capital payment made as compensation. Is it known what the position is in this respect? If the problem is to he looked at from the ^ angle, as suggested in your letter, of ownership or administration, the question whether ^descendants 11 covered non-heirs as well as heirs would become secondary. But the latter question would still have scope as regards that part of the Parhaniyeh estate owned by the non-heirs which is not administered by the heirs. And the whole problem can still be looked at from this angle, rather than from that of ownership or administration. ^ Here too I am assuming that we cannot now ascertain the true meaning of the Arabic word in the 1914 pledge which is rendered ”descendants” in the English version. There was I find some discussion in 1929 on the use of ”descendants” in the English version, but it was as regards its use instead I of the more usual term - according to Colonial Office letter j5b214/29 of 11th October, 1929 - ’’successors”. The Foreign Qffice in a letter E. 5244/1358/93 of 19th idem said that ”descendants” would appear only to include the actual heirs of the Sheikh’s body. (There is no mention of looking up the Arabic word). The word used in the English translation of Jof the pledge to the Sheikh of Mohammerah is 'heirs”, and prima facie one would have expected the same word, or words with the same meaning, to he used to the two Sheikhs in 1914. The letter to Sheikh Mubarak contain ing the pledge to him says in fact that ”1 have addressed a letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah similar to this I am writing you”. 'Heirs” is the basis on which the question of compensation in the Mohammerah case is being approached. In so far as the question is to be decided from the angle of the meaning of 'descendants”, it would seem also to be implicit, at least on merits, that the non-heirs should get their appropriate share of the total compensation if that is assessed on their tax also, as otherwise the heirs receive an openly uncovenanted benefit. Finally we should be grateful if you v^ould en lighten us as to the distinction between heir descendants and non-heir descendants in this connection. Does the former mean descendants on the male side only or only some of those? I donH know whether illegitimacy enters into the distinction in Arab conditions of life.3479 12360 (2) &gt;*2 iVo. 504 * (109/52/39) HIS Majesty’s 4100 i I 959 _J Wv ^rO Ant»assador at Bagdad presents his compliments to Hi8 Majeaty's ^ State and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents.

The only exception made is in the case of Fish and Meat Markets without any reason. I, under the circumstances, wrote a letter to the Qaimm a qam , Abul Khasaib on the 23rd May 1939 on the subject requesting him to in truct the Mudir of Fao Nahiya to deliver the Fish and Meat Market as well to our agent with the rents realised. 1 have likewise written to the Muair of Fao Nahiya, but so far have received no reply. As regards our estate at Feddigiyah, o i ir agent went there as arranged, but finds himself In adverse circumstances, and therefore is afraid to leave his house in case he is molested by the Fallehin in-stalled therein by the Audir Nahiya when the properties were attached. IVe have tried our best to eject these i- allanin with a view to replace them by our old Fall shin , but of no avail. Mudir Nahiya objects to this being done. The result is that these new Fallahin do not care for us or for our orders, and consequently their existence in our properties is detrimental to our interests, ^he best thing, therefore, is that these Fallah&amp;n be turned out from our property, and our old Fallahin re-instated for our future good.

My dear* Prime Minister, I venture to invoke Your Excellency^ personal help for the early and final settlement of the troublesome affair of the attachment of certain properties in Basra belonging to the Shaikh of Kowe it. It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the facts which are already familar to Your Excellency. I will only recall that, so long ago as March 29th, you informed Mr. Houstoun-Boswall that the Iraqi authorities concerned had given orders for these attachments to be cancelled and for the properties to be restored to the unfettered control of the Shaikh, A ffew days ago, in spite of your assurance to Mr. Houstoun-Boswall, I received a report from Koweit that toe local authorities of the Basra liwa were still interfering in the Shaikh’s control of these properties. I thereupon asked our Consul at n a sra to send me a report on the situation. After making careful enquiries, the Consul informed me that the Mudir of Eao continues to refuse to allow the Shaikh’s agent to re-establish in the Faddaghiyah gardens the fellahin whom the Mudir evicted last March and replaced by others hostile to the Shaikh. He has also informed me that the Shaikh’s agent is prevented by/ HIS EXCELLENCY SAIYID NURI)AL)SAID, G.C.V.O., ETC.the Mudir of Vao from collecting the rents due to; h.it5. frqfr the fish and meat markets at ^ao. I understand that Your Excellency agrees that the local authorities acted entirely without proper authority in attaching the properties of the Shaikh of Xoweit and that it is your wish that all action which was taken in pursuance of this attachment should be speedily reversed, the attachment itself formally cancelled, and the status quo ante restored. I trust therefore that Your Excellency will cause urgent instructions to be issued to the authorities concerned to desist forthwith from the reiterated and unwarranted interference in the Shaikh’s administration of his properties to which I have referred above.

I also informed him about the Pamiiy Council (see my telegram No.T/57 of 27t h February 1939). The Shaikh expressed no opinion on the adequacy or otherwise of the proposed compensation, but had strong I objections to it being paid to a Family Council. 3. I need not at present deal with these objections as there is another and more important question to be settled, as follows. All along the payment has been proposed to be made in respect of taxation losses 'on the late Shaikh Mub arak's estates In Iraq.' (e.g. paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter No.E.941/39/93 of 15th February 1939). The Siam proposed to be paid as compensation has been cilculdted on the average annual loss (£ 1087 approximately), vide para graph 2 of India Office Express Letter No.P.Z.1074/39, dated 28th February 1939. 4. But, as it has now occured to me, the figure of £ 1087 represented the annual loss not only on Shaikh Mub arak’s property now in possession of his heirs, but also on 2. On my last visit to Kuwait I accordingly approached R.T. Peel, Esquire, M.C The India Office, London. property /2 property in possession of members of the Shaikh’s family other than the heirs of Mibarak. If the term 'heirs' is to he strictly interpreted a new assessment of corn- pens ation will have to he made deducting from the basis of £ 1087 the average annual loss on property owned hy the members of the Shaikh’s family other than the heirs of ITUbarak. The Shaikh would of course have to be in formed, which naturally will be awkward. 5. If His Majesty’s Government decide that the present compensation is to stand then no further action is necessary. 6. If,-however, they decide that the compensation should be revised then my comments are as follows. \ (1) The division of the date gardens between 'heirs *- of Mubarak', including of course the Shaikh him self, and the 'non-heirs of Mubarak' must be either: (a) that the heirs own certain definite plots of land in the gardens and the non-heirs, other plots, or, what is more likely, (b) that there is no division of areas but a division in fixed proportion of the income from the gardens. (2) 'That we have to ascertain is the proportion of the annual taxation which the Shaikh paid on account of the heirs. 7. (1) If it is a case of (a) then we will have to deduct from our taxation basis the amount paid by the Shdikh for the produce from lands owned by the non-heirs. (2) /given ti h »t n 3. (2) If it is a case of (t)) then we will have to reduce our assessment hy the proportion in which the income is enjoyed hy the non-heirs. 8. I ashed de Gaury to try and ascertain verbally from the .Shaikh, without of course giving away the reasons for his enquiry, what was the position of the whole of the Subah family in connection with the date gardens. de Saury’s reply was that it was a case of paragraph 6 (l)(b) for the Fao estate, of 6 (l)(a) for the I'arhaniya estate, and the remaining estates were OYmed solely by the heirs of Iftibarak. But this in the circumstances cannot be taken as a final authoritative statement, and if it is decided to re-assess the compensation we shall have to request the Shaikh for an official statement. 9. The Shaikh has not raised the (question of compensation on my present visit, and if he should do so I will put him off with an appropriate reply. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe, and giving one to Galloway. —. c 'tirivrhj I • *' vv ' * sent under Printed Letter Bo.C/218 of 24/5/39.Confidential gent at Kuwait presents his oomf [i m eri&amp;7 ^ ^ , p. k:. 1.

This sort of interference with our property by the Iraij Government happens too frequently, without any reason, and our personal prestige has suffered consi derably of late. It is widely known that our properties in Iraq are to be protected by the High British Government according to their promise given in 1914 (Zulhijja 1332) which was conveyed by the Hon'ble the Political 3esident| Bushire, and the High British Government has always been protecting our interests by lawful means. We hope now that she will fulfil her promise in safe guarding our interests in Iraq. In the circumstances we sincerely hope that you will be kind enough to forward our request to the proper] quarters, as our interests lie in the hands of the High British Government. They are well known for their justice and their kindness towards their friends. I ll I know very well that you and the Hon'ble the Political Hesident are fully aware of the present situation but I hope that proper justice is soon given to us, since otherwise it will seriously affect our ll prestige. i '322 2^ 183 No, 2741 M. &gt;.!~1 (109/37/39) HIS Majesty s 1 a-p-poi r»o&lt;a at presents his compliments to H.M’s Principal Secretary of State for and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentToiSscl 3ocumei?ts.

Following this, on March 22ni, the Mudir of Fao attached the Shaikh’s property at Faddaghiyah, evicted all the cultivators and replaced them by others. I have no detailed information of the nature of the unpaid taxes in question, since none is given in the printed form mentioned above, but there seems little doubt that the sum claimed represents the total revenue assessments of the Shaikh’s properties in Iraq up to the time of the institution of the ’Istihlak’ tax system. always maintained the right to claim that the properties of the Shaikh of Koweit in Iraq should be exempted from taxation and that, in Mr. Bateman’s note No. 347 of July 6th, 1936, it was proposed, by way of final settlement of this question, that no further claim for the exemption of these properties from taxation should be made, provided that the Iraqi Government would, for their part, give a final/ cy Nuri al Said, C.I .G., D.E.Q., nister for Foreign Affairs, BAGDAD. 3 Your Excellency is aware that my Government havei 25°' final undertaking to make no claim for arrears o taxation in respect of these properties, ^ # This proposal was accepted by his Excellency Saiyid Taufiq al Suwaidi in his letter to Sir i.iaurice Peterson, No. 14184/2440/100 of October 30th, 1938. Your Excellency will therefore understand my astonishment at the present inexplicable action of the local authorities in Basra. 5 . i feel sure that Your Excellency will agree that it is essential that instructions should be issued at once cancelling the action taken by the Mudir of Pao and withdrawing the revenue demand which has been addressed to the Shaikh*s agent, and I hope that I may receive an early intimation that this has been done.

Dear Baxter, Please refer to your letter of 19th November last (E 6481/28/93) about the amount of compensation to be offered to the Sheikh of Xoweit and his family in respect of future taxation of the produce of his date gardens in Iraq. Our view of the logical position is set out in my letter of the 12th May last, S.32453/15, namely, that the amount to be offered should really be the same number of years’ purchase of the average loss as that which the sum which a purchaser of the gardens would offer is of the average profits. In so far as money rates in Iraq are a guide, it looks as if the number of years’ purchase of the profits which a purchaser of the gardens would offer would be considerably less than twenty. However, in order to avoid bargaining and to get a settlement which should leave no doubt in the mind of the Sheikh that he is being generously treated, we are prepared to accept Powle's rate of 5/, though not on the C.W. Baxter, Esq., M.C., ' part Foreign Office.M MV J* / part comparison with Government of India stock rates and British Bank interest rates which appears to have influenced him. This would yield a payment of approxi mately £21,000 on the basis of the annual tax figure of £1,087 taken in our letter of 24th August last. In Crosthwaite’s letter of the 9th September last (E 4999/28/93) it was suggested that there was a possibility of the Sheikh now being in possession of certain lands not occupied by Sheikh Mubarak in 1914, in which case capitalization on the above-mentioned incomeSheikh may be begun on the ba ;is of twenty years purchase of an annual tax figure of £1,087, with a discretion to Fowle to make a reservation on the point in initiating the discussion, should he consider it desirable to do so in the light of the latest local knowledge available to him. Je agree that the same interest rate as is applied in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit sho\ild also be applied in the case of the heirs of Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah. I am sending a cony of this letter to Gibson of the India Office. Yours sincerely.Cory British Kmhsssy, (E 6676/£8/93) No. (176/20/38) YN AIR L &gt; a L . (Copies 'by beg). Bagdad, 3rd November, 1938. My Lord, ;.ith reference to Your Lordship’s telegram No. 108 of 9th August, I have the hon &gt;ur to transmit to you herewith a translation of a letter which I have received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replying to Mr. Bateman’s Note No. 347 of 8th July, 1936, concerning the applic tion of Land Settlement to the roperties of the Shaikhs of Koweit and i uhammerah, and a copy of my reply. 2. It will be noticed th t the wording of the fifth paragraph of the Ministry of Foreign Affair’s letter differs slightly from that communicated to you in my telegram No. Ill of 22n July in that the word ’non-Iraq’ has been omitted before ’nationalit/'• 3 understand that this omission was due to the reluctance of the Iraqi laovernment to commit ihemselves in any way concerning the nationality of the Shaikh of Koweit. It does not appear, however, that the value of the undertaking given in this paragraph is, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, in any way impaired by this omission. Therefore, having regard to the importance of expediting the declaration of Land Settlement before the Faddaghiyah appeal comes before the Courts, I did not consider that it was desirable to risk further long delay by attempting to persuade the Iraqi/ The Right Honourable, The Viscount Halifax, K. • , G.C.S.I., G.C.T.ij.,Iraqi Government to restore the abandoned word, 5. The other paragraphs of the Minister’s letter are the same as the corresponding paragraphs of the draft enclosed in Mr. Morgan’s letter to Mr. B^ggallay No. 176/3/36 of 9th March. 4. T shall now do my best to bring about the earliest possible declaration of Land Settlement in the Pao and Siba Nahiyahs of the Basra Liwa which embrace all the , properties of the Shaikh of Koweit. 5.

Houstoun-Boswall.Enclosure No. 1 In Bagdad despatch No, 543 dated 3rd November. 1938 * No* 14184/2440/100. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bagdad, 30th October, 1938. Your Excellency, The proposals concerning the properties in Iraq claimed by the Shaikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah which were contained in Iv : r. C.H. Bateman* 8 Note No. 347 of 8th July, 1936, addressed to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, A1 Saiyid Nuri A1 Be id, have now received the careful consideration of the Iraqi Government. 2. The Iraqi Government are disposed to accept these proposals, subject to the following;-* 3. With regard to sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 6 of Mr. Bateman’s Note, legislation must be passed before the undertaking can be given. The Iraqi Government are prepared to propose such legislation and, on its comn^g into force, to give the undertaking requested. 4. with regard to sub—paragraph (b) of paragraph 6, ^he British Government may rest assured that the Iraqi Government have no intention df imposing discriminatory taxation on the property of any person in Iraq. Furthermore the British Government must be aware that such taxation would be in conflict with the provisions of the Iraqi Constitution. The Iraqi Government do not, therefore, consider it proper or necessary for any further assurance to be given by them in this connexion. 5. With regard to paragraph 8 the Iraqi Government confirm/ His Excellency, Sir Maurice Drummond Peterson, •C.k.G. His Britannic Majesty* s Ambassador t?— rtpr»v Pi enlxiot.entiary in Iraq.confirm thst the nationality of the two shaikhs shall constitute no impediment or delay to the completion of the registration of the properties which may be awarded to them in accordance with the provisions of the Land Settlement Law. 6. The Iraqi Government are prepared to give the assurance mentioned in paragraph 9 on the basis of the Land Settlement Law or the Regulations issued thereunder. 7. ith regard to paragraph 10, it is necessary to point out that Article 25 (b) of the Land Settlement Law provides that all judgments of the Special Court are subject to appeal to the Court of Cassation on points of law. The Iraqi Government cannot, therefore, confine litig tion against the Shaikh of M&gt;weit to appeals, against the decisions of the Land Settlemen'c ufiicer, to the Special Court set up by virtue of Article 4 of the Law. 8. V*ith regard to paragraph 12, it follows from paragraph 7 above that the British Government should recognise the decision of the Court of Cassation as well as the decisions of the Land Settlement Officer and the Special Court, nd that the British Government’s undertaking not to object to any changes which may result to the present boundaries of the ShaikhS lands in consequence of the land settlement procedure must extend to changes which may result from any decisions of the oourt of Cassation. 9. The Iraqi Government consider it necessary as part of the settlement of the present question to put an end finally to all disputes as to the coapetence of the Iraqi Courts and the application of Iraqi law in all matters relating to immovable property in Iraq owned or possessed&lt;g) Hit, 'by either Sheikh or in which either Shaikh has or claims an interest, and for this purpose the Iraqi Government declare that for the future they will exercise the Iraqi jurisdiction over such property and all matters relating thereto without any distinctions being made between it and other immovable property in Iraq or between the Shaikhs and other persons interested in immovable property in Ira q. 10. On receiving the British Government acceptance of the conditions above-mentioned the Iraqi Government are prepared to carry out with a minimum of delay the course of action proposed in Mr. Bateman’s Note and this Note.
