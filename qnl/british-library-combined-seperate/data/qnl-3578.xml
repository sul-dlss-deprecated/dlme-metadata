The file contains correspondence relating to: plans of the Californian Standard Oil Company to construct landing strips along the Arab coast between Dhahran and Kuwait; Pan-American Airways aircraft being used by the United States military in the region, and an agreement that such aircraft should be entitled to the same privileges in using aerodrome facilities as British RAF aircraft; concerns among British officials at Pan-American Airways’ attempts to further their commercial interests in the Gulf during the war. A final item of correspondence in the file, dating from 1950, concerns a request by the Lebanese authorities to extend an air route to Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Pan American World Airways</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002f0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002f0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002f0#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
