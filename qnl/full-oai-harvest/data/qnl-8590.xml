Much of the correspondence is between the Foreign Office and India Office/Government of India, and discusses: precedents to the request (specifically, a request for Survey of India maps from the Afghan Government in 1936); the Government of India’s refusal of the Iranian Government’s request in August 1937, due to the continued military importance of the maps in question; a long delay in responding to the Iranian Government’s request, which remained unanswered until November 1938.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Access to information</topic></subject><subject><topic>Maps</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Survey of India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000047#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000047#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
