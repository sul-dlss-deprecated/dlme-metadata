It may be useful to explain, in continuation of the printed departmental Memorandum of the 28th December 1911, the present position of the scheme lor the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian (xidi, adopted as the result of the local enquiry held in 1909. A convenient starting point is the ' summary of maximum possible expenditure,' described in paragraph 12 of that Memorandum in the following words; ' Assuming, for the sake of ' completeness, that the lights and buoys recom- ' mended in the letters of the India Office of the ' U'th September and 18th November 1911 {see ' paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without ' the adoption of the Treasury suggestions), that a ' lighthouse tender were procured at a cost of ' 30,000L initial, and 5,000i. annual recurring, ' and that a depot were equipped at the full ' capital cost of 22,000L, the resulting expenditure ' would amount to initial 102,400L, annual ' recurring 7,TOOL' 2. The ' Treasury suggestions ' above referred to were that a light vessel proposed for the Shatt- el-Arab should be dispensed with, and that a liglited buoy should be substituted at Bushire for a light- vessel. After some correspondence the Treasury withdrew their objection to the Shatt-al-Arab light- vessel, but, as regards Bushire, it was decided that a lighted buoy (at the outer anchorage m addition to that for the inner anchorage) would be sufficient. In another important respect the scheme described in paragraph 1 was modified, viz , m the elimination of the spare light-vessel ( CC)S ^ 9,500L) that had been included as part ot the equipment of the depot (cost 22,UOUL) s. 186. a3. The items of the scheme as ultimately sanctioued were, therefore, as follows Scheme as ultimately sanctioned. Light, &amp;C., and Locality.

These are in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911 and the unlit buoys taken over from the British India Company.| It was subsequently decided that the cost of two dioptric lanterns for Bushire {see paragraph 11 below) should be met from savings out of the total figures here given. * In abeyance, .see paragraph 6. It is in addition to the British lighted buoy already laid in the Shatt-al-Arab (outer bar). See paragraph 6 of earlier Memorandum. t Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Memorandum dated the 28th December 1911.

By good fortune it was found possibie to obtain for the Tanb Island lighthouse the plant that had been ordered for a lighthouse for the Colonial Office. The construction of this light house is consequently well in hand. The plant for the lighthouse at Musandam has been ordered, but will not be ready for several months. As regards the Shaikh Shuaib lighthouse, there has been a hitch, owing to the fact that the conditions attached by the Persian Government to the erection of a lighthouse on their territory are unacceptable.

The cost and 4mf e, l ^ Stated ab0Ve ' is 8 ' OOM - initia l. and tOOt. annual recurring. The corresponding figures for the cost of a light-vessel, according to Innitj House estimates, are 9,500i. initial, and i mnual recurring. (The Indian authorities aye, however, stated that they could themselves build a light-vessel for 1,080^. less, i.e., 8,mi see paragraph 5 below.) o. On the lecommendation of the Grovernment of India the light-vessel for the Shatt-al-Arab is being constructed in Bombay Dockyard, where light-vessels have been built for the Bay of Bengal. According to latest information, it is anticipated that a saving of 1,080L may be effected on the sanctioned estimate (9,500Z.) The iron mast, lantern, &amp;c. are to be sent out from home. 6. Five lighted buoys have been sent out (in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911). The sixth, intended for the inner bar of the Shatt-al-Arab, is not for the present being supplied, in view of the negotiations opened with the Turkish Government for the establishment of a Shatt-al-Arab Navigation Commission. 7. The unlit buoys are, like the light-vessel, being constructed in Bombay Dockyard on the recommendation of the Government of India. 8. A matter in which no progress has yet been made is that of the lighthouse tender. The Committee that reported after local inquiry in 1909 on the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf regarded it as imperative that a specially constructed steamer should be provided to act as a lighthouse tender, and Mr. D. W. Hood, the expert member of the Committee, wrote in his Supplementary ReportI estimate her cost, ' delivered in the Persian Gulf, after coustruction in England, at 30,00$. The Indian Government ' from their own experience will be able to estimate ' what her annual maintenance would be in the ' East, but it would probably amount to about ' 5,0001. per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, ' coal, stores, and all charges.' These figures— initial expenditure dU,UUUt., and annual recurring 5,000L—represent the maximum estimate sanctioned by the Secretary of State m Council and the Treasury, but the plans received from India are for a larger vessel than that contem plated, and one that would cost very much more to maintain The matter is still under consideration.9. It was first proposed to locate the lighthouse depot at Koweit, but this plan was abandoned in favour of a site on the land leased by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the island of Abadan, near Mohammerah. Details are about to be investigated locally, but the conditions contemplated are, briefly, that land up to a total of two acres should be rented at U. an acre for 49 years from the 29th May 1912, the period of the Company's own lease, and that the Company should carry out certain works recommended by the Trinity House,supply oil (if in accordance with specification), and erect the necessary oil tanks. It is hoped that the result of the local investi gation will enable work at the depot to proceed without delay. An appreciable saving should apparently be effected on the cost of the depot, as originally estimated, through the employment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's agency. 10. In accordance with the recommendation of Trinity House, certain stores for the depot are being sent out from England, viz :— 2 spare lighted buoys. 2 spare lanterns. 3 sets of spare buoy moorings. It is also in contemplation to send out a crane. 11. Mention may here be made of the supply of two dioptric lanterns for the Residency at Bushire at an estimated cost of approximately 124^. initial expenditure, plus 2J per cent, for Trinity House charges, and 241. annual recurring. The Treasury took exception to the supply of these lanterns outside the sanctioned programme, and explanations were furnished by this Office. 12. In a letter to the Foreign Department, dated the 11th August 1912, Sir P. Cox has called attention to ' the regrettable consequences, both ' political and economic, that might result from the ' failure of any light, even temporarily,' and, with a view to placing future administrative arrange ments on a satisfactory footing, has suggested that for the present the Political Resident should be the chief lighting authority in (he Gulf and ex officio Inspector oi Lights,' and that pending the provision of the lighthouse tender the officer commanding the R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence' should be gazetted u Assistant Inspector of Lights.' He has also suggested a scale of allowances for officers and men of the 'Lawrence' employed in lighting and buoyage work. The views of the Government of India on these proposals have not yet been received. Any extra expenditure on this head may perhaps be met out of savings effected on other parts of the scheme.
