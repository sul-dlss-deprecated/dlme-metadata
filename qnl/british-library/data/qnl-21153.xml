When I was in Sharjah recently I enquired what food supplies Qatar had been taking from Dubai. I under stood that during the month of July alone Qatar imported from Dubai 4281 bags of rice (equivalent to nearly 330 tons). These figures can be checked, if necessary, from the routine statement of imports and exports which R.A. sends us every month. 2. We shall have to see that the Shaikh of Qatar does not duplicate his imports of rice, flour etc. by obtain ing these commodities both direct from India and by re-export from Dubai. 8/8/42. It Supplies of rice for Trucial Coast and Bahrain. R.A. Sharjah tells me that it is most unlikely that during the next two or three months the Trucial Coast will use its quota of rice from Calcutta. The reason is that there are already substantial supplies of Karachi rice in Dubai and merchants will not import Calcutta rice, which is so very much more expensive, until stocks of Karachi rice are much reduced. 2. It will be a great pity if rice which India has made available to the Persian Gulf should not be brought here and I have little doubt that Bahrain would like to import any Calcutta rice surplus to Trucial Coast requirements. This will have to be verified from the Adviser but, if the Bahrain Government are willing to import stocks of Calcutta rice, I suggest that we should help them to do so. The best means of doing this is for us to examine the Trucial Coast Civil Requirements Programme as soon as it is received. / From* that programme we can see what amount of rice is being imported from Calcutta# If there is a surplus for the month i*e* if proposed imports are below the quota per- mitted, we can at once inform the Bahrain Government and they can make an addition to their own Civil Requirements Programme. Against that addition we should have to add the words 'Debitable to Trucial Coast Quota'. 3. If for any reason which I do not foresee there is some flaw in this procedure, an alternative would be to get D.I. to import rice from Calcutta to Dubai (the necessary addition being made to the Trucial Coast Civil Requirements Programme) and such rice can then be brought on to Bahrain either by country craft or by the same steamer in which id it carried from India. 4. If neither of these suggestions can be carried out other alternative methods of utilising the Trucial / Coasts full quota of rice can probably be devised. In view of the shortage of rice stocks in Bahrain and in view of the difficulties which may be experienced later in the year in obtaining rice from India, I think it absolutely essential that we should obtain now all the rice that we possibly can. question at length with the Residency Agent. I also dis cussed it with the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah. It was the general view that the Shaikhdoms of the Trucial quota of rice allotted to them from that place. The reason for this is (a) Calcutta rice is of better quality, and therefore more expensive ; than Karachi rice^and even in normal times the people of the Trucial Coast cannot afford Food Quotas for Trucial Coast On my recent visit to Sharjah I discussed this Coast could not, and would not, obtain from Calcutta the the Calcutta quality of rice* (b) the transport of rice from Calcutta is terribly expensive. Transport by dhow is N N*■ ( impossible and insurance charges on freight by steamer are very heavy* I was told that Calcutta rice landed at Dubai costs the importer Rs28-30 per bag, while the cost of • • Karachi rice landed at Dubai is only Rsl8/-. 2. The Residency Agent is communicating to all the Sh+ttA Shaikhdoras their pyapisrUaa of the aggregate Trucial Coast quotas* He expects that most of the Shaikhs will protest strongly against the obligation to import so much of the rice allotted to them from Calcutta. I myself think it a pity that so large a proportion of the Trucial Coast*s quota should be obtainable from Calcutta since Ca) people on the Trucial Coast are poorer than people in Bahrain or Kuwait and cannot afford to buy Calcutta rice however much they need rice and Cb) Bahrain and Kuwait normally import rice from Calcutta by steamer whereas the Trucial Coast has not in recent years imported any rice from Calcutta but has brought the greater part of its requirements from Karachi in dhows* If the Trucial Coast is now compelled to bring its rice from Calcutta there will be an unnecessary use of steamer space since, if the Trucial Coast could get its rice from Karachi it would bring it all in dhows*. 3* When we hear what the aarangementna of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs are it may be possible to help them by exchang ing a given portion of the Trucial Coast*s Calcutta quota for a smaller portion of the Karachi quota of Bahrain or Kuwait. By this means the Trucial Coast would be the losers on paper i*e. their aggregate quota would be reduced, but would be the gainers in practice as they would import the full amount of rice available to them from Karachi whereas they will be compelled to leave untouched a sub stantial portion of their Calcutta quota. Bahrain and Kuwait would also profit from such an interchange since they would get a larger quantity of rice from Calcutta in return for their surrender of a smaller quantity of rice from Karachi. 4. This is only a tentative suggestion which may be wholly impracticable. In any case nothing can be done# • • # • I-C 4?

Confidential. \ 1 The people are not satisfied at the present arrangement made by the Food Controller as regards the distribution of food and the issue of sale chits on shopkeepers from whom the food is to be obtained. It appears that no peoper account of the quantity of rice which the merchants have in stock is kept because on occasions it happens that the office of the ^ood Controller issues sale chits on merchants for the supply of a certain kind of rice which they have not got in stock. Thus the chit sometimes has to be changed 3 or 4 times until they get at the right man from whom the rice is to be obtained. The rich and the middle class of people do not care if any delay is caused to them by changing their sale chits but the poor class who forms the majority of the population of Bahrain and who lives from hand to mouth v/ill suffer if a better arrangement is not made in the rationing system. It was lately decided that the people should drop their cards in a box which has been kept for this purpose. This arrangement may be of advantage to the staff of the Food Controller whose desire is to keep the mob away from their offices but it will not help the poor people in getting sale chits earlier than before, because it is evident that a villager who drops his card in the box first may be the last man to get his sale chit as it cannot be ascertained from the hundreds of cards dropped in the same box who is the first and who is the lafct man who dropped his card in the box. The villagers who come from a long distance and whose family eagerly await their arrival with food have to be the constant visitors of the Food Controller’s office until they get their sale chits. After getting the sale chits the poor people are then confronted with another difficulty « * i.e., their inability to pay for the ration which has been issued for one month. It is said that the shopkeepers have been told to issue food to the poor people by instalments if they cannot afford to pay, but this arrangement v/ill also be to the benefit of the shopkeeper who may for the first time give a poor man a small quantity of food and put him off the second and third time until he gets fed up and ceases to go to the shopkeeper. The poor people want nothing but ready made bread as it is very P.T.O.difficult for a large number of them who have no proper arrange ment for baking to get their bread baked soon after their return from work. If the flour which is now issued to them and to the public could be given to the bakers who should be kept under strict supervision so that they may not conceal any part of it, the poor people may be saved from their difficult position. Most of the poor people are now living on fresh dates and water, and fish if they would be able to get it in time. The fresh dates may last for another one month only. The flour v/hich is sold by the shopkeepers is full of insects and worms and it is suspected that the shopkeepers, who have been appointed by the l4 ‘ood Controller may be selling by special arrangement with some merchants the old flour which they had concealed a long time ago and have not declared to the -food Controller. The Food Controller sometimes increases the rate of some foodstuff which is owned by certain merchants without seeing the invoices of other merchants. The people say that the Food Controller should see the invoices of other merchants and then decide about increasing the rate of the foodstuffs as one special merchant might produce a false invoice which has been prepared by his agent in India or elsewhere. There are many retail shopkeepers in Manamah and Muharraq who have not since the last 1^ months, it is said, been given any rice by the Food Controller's office whereas some selected shopkeepers get their stock regularly. The Food Controller issues sale chits continuously on some merchants until their whole stock is exhausted and leaves the others. This indicates that either the office of the Food Controller is doing this through ignorance,or purposely in order to favour their own friends and give them a better chance to make profit by increasing the rate of the foodstuffs which they possess. The people say that the present arrangement is not satisfactory and there is no hope for any improvement in the rationing system,,so long as the Director of Customs is in charge of Food Control, unless a Committee consisting of some honest and impartial merchants Y/ho are better aware of the requirements of the people be appointed for this purpose.' - » r J.

Tr Nailsea Hoor ff , which manifests 12,643 hags of Canadian (Manitoba) wheat, shipped by The Ministry of Food without marks, or consi-'mee stated. * There can be no doubt that this is the quantity of wheat asked for some time ago (as per my telegram to Stanley &amp; John j homp son Limited, of 13th May last); and the quantity is being dul' r taken into charge for re-sale to the public. Unofrtunately for us, the wheat has been bagged in single gunnies whicn do not stand up well to repeated handling, expeoiallv with nooxs. The quality of the wheat is excellent; and it ia great pity that so much leakage should have occurred in transit. This shortage will reduce the total quantity to be ultimately received into charge, as I have arranged with steamer T s Agents that every defective bag shall be put aside and re-filled to the proper weight before being accepted by the Customs. Up to date the cost of this shipment is not known, so it is impossible at the moment to ascertain how much the Government of Bahrain will have to pay, and, the price to be charged to bhe public later on. I have asked for this price to be wired for, as it is desirable that the wheat may be issued as early as possible. In the meanwhile I would suggest the desirability of arranging for another supply of ten thousand bags of wheat, either from Canada or from the Argentine-Brazil, where, I understand, there is a tremendous glut in the market. Such a quantity should arrive here by the time the present supply is exhausted. i\W Confidential * No*C/12Q7 * To Political Agency, Bahrain, the 10th August 1942* cb) The Station Superintendent, British Overseas Airways Corporation, Bahrain* Dear Sir, Reference your letter No*BAH/l/636/C-5 dated 2nd August 1942.

The other articles are also issued by permits^from Control Office, which cause a great difficulty in obtaining. Most of the members are habituated to wheat only and by taking rice continuously, for such a long time, the health is going down rapidly. Now-a-days, even rice is not available in sufficient quantity and we are just facing the starvation point. Therefore we request you to kindly arrange our food stuffs being sent ftfom Karachi as it was in Jiwani and to kindly relieve us from the terrible starvation. Thanking you in anticipation. 3d/- S.A.

Sir / I have the honour to refer to your letter No.3/1625/OA-4E dated 29th July 1942. 2. At the time when the Pilot-Balloon Observatory Staff's letter was written, there were some difficulties over the food situation in Bahrain, but the letter greatly exaggerated them. Since then further supplies have arrived and, with the introduc tion by the Government of India of a quota system to ensure adequate supplies of essential foodstuffs for Bahrain and the introduction by the Bahrain Government of a system of rationing them, former difficulties have largely disappeared. The Obser vatory Staff can obtain essential foodstuffs under the ration ing system, and there should be no need to import special food for them from Karachi.

To sace lime and formalities it is worded and signed as if it had been so despatched,] Confidential , Urgent . Fbom Political Bahrain. To Political Resident, at Bahrain. ^ C/1277. Dated 22nd August 1942. • On the 2nd August 1942, when the rice position in Bahrain was serious, owing partly to the fact that it had become clear that the previously sanctioned monthly quota of 383 tons and the ration fixed in consequence of it by the Pood Controller were thoroughly inadequate, and partly to the fact that even the sanctioned quota was not being shipped here from India, the agent of the firm of Dhamanmal Isardas informed me that he had 700 tons of rice at Cal. cutta ready for shipment here if an export permit from India could be obtained. I therefore issued the telegram, of which a copy is enclosed, to the Export Trade Controller, Calcutta. The reason for the request that the consignment should be debited to the Trucial Coast quota was that (owing to the existence of considerable stocks there)the Trucial Coast had not indented, in its Loading Programnes, for its full quota of rice from Calcutta in July-August, and a Request for an additional shipment within the sanctioned Trucial MFp_1206 SAP—(M-l 723)—4-2-30—200,000. / Coast- 2 - Coast quota would not, whereas a request for an addition to the full Bahrain Programmes would, cause confusion. Whether It would be necessary for any portion of this consignment, after arrival in Bahrain, to be re-exported to Dubai would depend on the situation here and on the Trucial Coast when it arrived and whether by that time Bahrain was receivii^g its full sanctioned quota. 2. I received no reply to my telegram from the Export Trade Controller, Calcutta, but Dhamanmal Issardas has now produced a wire from his Bombay office indicating that the Export Trade Controller will not issue an export permit for this consignment without instructions from the Government of India. There is at present in Bahrain only five weeks'reserve of rice, and fresh supplies are arriving irregularly. Furthermore, since the issue of my telegram to the Export Trade Controller the Government of India have transferred 208 tons from the Trucial Coast quota to the Bahrain quota. I therefore request that, if you see no objection, the Government of India may be asked telegraphically to release this consignment of 700 tons, on the understanding that I will ensure that such portion of it/is surplus to Bahrain* s quota is then re-exported to Saudi Arabia, to meet the shortage there which H.M.Minister at Jedda reports. (Such re-adjustments as this transaction invc grammes when the quota s possible, then at least the 208 tons by which the Bahrain 1 *^ August Loading Programme fell short of its now sanctioned quota may kindly be released. 3. The matter is urgent, as Dhamanmal Isardas reports that the loading of the steamer at Calcutta on which he wishes to send this consignment began today. as f for Political Agent, Bahrainlamediatet The Agency, D»0»No»C/X278 &gt; Bahrain, the 22nd August 1942* With reference to our discussions this morning, will you please let me have, very urgently, the totals, during each of the last 3 years, of the imports of rice, wheat and wheat flour made by each of the merchants who import these commodities into Bahrain. Imports for local consumption and for re-export may kindly be shown separately. 2. It would facilitate my enquiry if you would kindly send your Head Clerk with the required figures to my office.

In reference to your No: C/1269 oY the 20-8-42, and to our interview of yesterday, wherein we discussed an adaptation of the September Requirements Programme to the Proposed List of Established Shippers to Bahrain, I had to point out to you that this 'Proposed List' was somewhat out-of-date, and in any case was inapplicable to local conditions. to import the quantities assigned to him in the Loading Programme, and the fact that nobody can export without an importer, it seems to me that the wiser allocation of the Quota would be so that it conforms with local requirements, rather than an hypothetical list which it is impossible to put into effect. You will thus save the risk of arousing local resentment from Importers. I have extracted from the September programme the details of the merchants' undertakings which I enclose herewith, as regards Karachi Rice, Calcutta Rice, and Karachi Flour, which are quite clear and conform to the local merchants' ability to import; and I would recommend you to adopt this list in the place of your 'Proposed List of Established Shippers'.

Dixon Esquire, I.C.S., Acting Political Agent, ’ BAHRAIN:*Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Shaaban 12, 1361 August 25, 1942. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, IV^ /V Bahrain. (j Memorandum: - It seems likely that the new arrangement which has been made to enable certain Bahrain merchants to import rice and flour up to the amount of the authorised quota will necessitate a change in the amount of profit which has been allowed by the Government. From the time that measures were taken in Bahrain to control the supply and price of food the merchants who imported the supplies were allowed a clear profit of 10% on their goods. This system worked well for some time until the Government of India imposed restrictions on the export of certain foodstuffs and required exporters to obtain export permits before removing the foodstuffs from India. The imports into Bahrain then decreased although RE cargo continued to arrive. A number of discussions took place and the merchants stated that the chief reason for their failure to import food for Bahrain was the difficulty in obtaining exit permits which could only be got by spending money on bribes and this expense could not reasonably be shown on the statements which they submitted to the Customs. They also admitted that it was more profitable to trade with Saudi-Arabia and they con tended that they were entirely in the hands of their Agents in India who sent them goods for Bahrain or for re-tran shipment according to the amount of profit to be made in either Bahrain or Saudi-Arabia. As profits were bigger in Saudi-Arabia and the Agents shared in the profits more goods were sent for transhipment than for import^ into Bahrain.2 The matter was discussed on innumerable occasions by His Highness and his uncles and myself. His Highness was and still is extremely displeased by the mercenary and unpatriotic attitude of the merchants, of whom almost all were foreigners, including Nejdis and Persians who started life in Bahrain as men of no consequence or means and who might have been expected to assist their country of adoption in a time of crisis. During June the position became worse, the Government of India had laid down a quota to cover Bahrain^require ments in rice and flour but the merchants failed to import the amount allowed in the quota. Eventually, on 22nd June, with the greatest reluctance, His Highness decided that in order to induce the local merchants to import rice and flour they should be allowed 20$ instead of 10$ profit on imports of these two essential foodstuffs. The merchants were informed of this measure by a customs notice, of which a copy is enclosed, but this concession failed to produce satisfactory results. Now the whole position has changed. It can no longer be argued that much money has to be spent on obtaining export permits and that Bahrain merchants are faced with great difficulties in persuading their Agents to send goods to Bahrain. The quota and the authorised list of Bahrain importers and Indian Agents are known to us and if Agents misbehave or merchants fail to place orders which they have promised to do presumably their trade activities can be restricted. The position is now that the merchants will strive to be included in the list of authorised merchants who are allowed to share the quota and there should be no necessity to bribe them to bringsupplies to Bahrain by a 20$ profit, at the expense of the consumer. In addition the new arrangement about re-exports to Saudi-Arabia will prevent profits on RE trade being greater than profits on direct Bahrain trade. Taking all these matters into consideration it now seems an appropriate time for the Bahrain Government to revert to the previous arrangement by which importers were allowed 10$, not 20$, profit on their imports into Bahrain. I should be obliged if you would favour me with your views on the matter, particularly as with two or three exceptions all the merchants concerned are foreigners. Adviser to the Government.

Lxdts of established exporters at each of the Indian ports are being prepared and will shortly be forwarded showing the proportion of export trade which each of them normally handles. Political Agents after consultation with local importers will inform the export Trade Controllers at the Indian ports of the names of exporters in these lists to whom licenses for stated quantities should be granted, taking care to keep within (i) The total monthly quota for each commodity, (ii) In the case of rice the fixed fraction thereof for each Indian Port. Importers shoudl simultaneously place their orders on the nominated exporters. Political Agents xhBHsi should do their best to ensure that orders are dis tributed amongst established exporters in India, roughly in proportion to their share in the export trade. Additions to the list of exporters may be proposed subject to the condition that it can be shown that firms so proposed have been regularly engaged in the export trade to the Persian Gulf in the past. ho proposal for an export monopoly such as was recently made from Kuwait can be considered. t* ^ Jn©3A fa 1 .:wsj 7{ ifnx A. — ^rzrzzzrr~r .—c Jji©i aSV« • 8 39031; ff&lt;» y • ft* \ nut hi - o4 Qtittl 5 ( 0 i Ji.T lo. sM m 6 ■ i—rV'S-r ifcirfV ■; 79/143. \ i Ttlegraju 7roiD To No•6847 • Dat«d atUh received 29th Auguet 1942.

The Agency, Bahrain, the 30th August 1942* O' j^U Please refer to my Memorandum No.C/1269, dated the 2( th ugust 1942, and our subsequent discussions, on the subject of food quotas* 2* ihe Political Resident has pointed out to the Government of India some of the difficulties that arise out of the lists of which a copy was forwarded with my letter, for instance that Nos. 2, 5 and 7 of the proposed Karachi Rice shippers do little or no business with Bahrain, for various reasons* He feels, however, that even if those lists are in other respects unsatisfactory and it is not clear to us at this end how they have been compiled, we should stick to them as closely as possible to start with, until we have ascertained to what extent they are susceptible of change at our suggestion and to what extent we find they are unworkable, as otherwise there is a danger of our falling between two stools* I have interviewed the importing merchants, both individually and collectively, with a view to the allotment of quotas based, as far as possible, not only on the figures supplied by the Government of India, but also on the proportionate shares of the export trade from India of the various importers and re-exporters here. I have obtained from them thu figures of their imports of the chief quota commodities for the last three years and, as the addition of their figures gives totals remarkably close to the total Bahrain imports as recorded in Trade Reports, I have no reason to suspect any particular figures of having been unduly 'cooked*. ^ I Oh 3* I enclose 3 statements which I have prepared on the basis of the information supplied to me by the merchants^ they explain themselves. Column 4 in each statement gives the C*C»L. de Grenier Esquire, Director of Customs, i Bahrain. / proportionateproportionfite shares of the importing merchants based entirely on / the figures of their trade in the last 3 years with which they supplied me, except that Dhamenmal Isardas has been given a modest increase of 25 extra tons of Karachi rice in view of the fact that, before the fall of Burma, he used to buy nearly 80$ of his total requirements of rice from Rangoon (a vastly higher percentage than any other merchant here) and that other merchants* shares have been proportionately decreased. Also a few of the lesser merchants, who 7? had smell figures both of rice and flour, were given the option of trading in either one or the other and a total figure for the commodity chosen equal to the original figures combined. Columns 2 and 3 are based, not on precise figures, but on rough estimates of their proportions of Local and Re-export trade given to me by the merchants. Column 5 is based on information given me by the mer chants. Column/is a suggested division of importers* allotments among the various exporters, based on the Government of India*s list and designed to cause as little inconvenience to importers as possible. Nos. 5 and 7 of the Government of India*s list of Karachi rice shipper* have been omitted, but No.3 has been included as the merchants named have expressed their readiness to trade with him. No.6 of the Calcutta rice list has, I understand, disposed of his business some 4-5 years ago to the Poojara Trading Company, but licences made out Company. In passing the final lists on to the Export Trade Con troller, I will clear this point with him. 4. The Loading Programme forwarded with your Memorandum No.PA/RP/12/459 dated 10th August 1942 will be followed as far as govern orders placed in September for October shipments . fill you kindly examine the three statements enclosed? The allotments indicated in column 4 of each list do not affect to be perfect, for they are baaed purely on figures whose accuracy I have no means of checking, and there may well be reasons for amending them. If 6 in his name will presumably be dealt with by tholPtrejera- Trading exports for September are concerned. The new allotments will / youkm -3- «rv»i t you wish to make appreciable changes In them, I would be grateful if you would kindly inform me, before referring to the merchants, noting your reasons* If not, will you please acquaint the mer chants with the individual allotments proposed for the^ for October, ascertain whether they can place orders accordingly^ n^w, make such changes in columns 2, 3 end 6 as their representations indicate to be desirable, provided that the figures to exporters in column 6 conform reasonably closely to the lists furnished by the GovernpoLent of India, and thereafter send me, as early as possible^ end in (Sili cate, a list (in the same form as the ,f Civil Requirements Programmes 1 *) showing to whom export licences at the Indian ports should be granted for October shipments * The procedure as far as the merchants here are concerned will then be the same as it has been in the case of the Loading Programmes in the past, except that they should not place orders on the consignors mentioned in the list until they are requested to do so, through you, by this Agency* For this reason it is necessary that the list should be here earlier than the Load ing Programmes - in fact, as early as possible* The Loading Pro grammes should not henceforth include quotaed commodities. 5. For future months, the Political Resident is prepared to pass on to the Government of India any reasonable proposals for the revision of the lists* It is doubtless inconvenient for mer- e scoffe rs chants here to have to deal in some cases with mftamtm to whom they are not accustomed, but in view of the fact that Export Trade Con trollers will now be asked to state in each licence the details given in para 4 of my memorandum of the 20th August referred to (in addition to the name of the steamer,) the exporters* previous habit of hawking their licences round among importers* agents in Karachi to secure the best bidder should come to n end* If in the course of time it transpires that any of the exporters is not complying satisfactorily with orders placed on himy—e.g. that he is overcharging, failing to ship or sending 'short bags** or goods of inferior quality, — then the question of his removal from the list or the reduction of his / quota-4- '*?) quota can be taken up. Stepe have been taken to ascertain each week the wholesale commodity prices in Karachi and Calcutta and lists of them will be sent to you when received. 6. I told the merchants the other day that they would be in formed of their allotments of the quotas in due course by you. I shall be grateful if, when taking the action indicated in the previous para, you will kindly make it clear that the figures for October shipmenos are ngt intended to be final and permanent allotments. There are many reasons why we may want to c-hange them in the light of experience. Furthermore, Mr. Wakefield may well wish to make alterations. The merchants may be shown the Government of Indian listf^in order that they may see why some of them have been paired with agents with whom they have not previously had dealings. I told thecy in general terms of these lists when they were here, but did not give them details - though incidentally, I found that many of them had already been made familiar with them, through their agents in India. 7. The Government of Indian Calcutta Rice list does not include the extra 208 tons which have been allotted to Bahrain. The figures in that list, if all increased in the same proportion, would be as follows 8.

HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTIES POLITICAL AGENT, Bahrein* Dear Sir, FLOUR REQUIRSt,TENTS. We recently placed an order on Caltex (India) Limited at Bombay for shipment to us at Bahrein of fifty 196 - lb. sacks of flour. Messrs. Caltex (India) Limited have now communicated with us stating they have received advice from the Supply Department the Government of India that there is a definite fixed quota for grain and flour to be exported to Bahrein and the Supply Department are assuming that the requirements of the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited come within this quota. Before they will allow this or future orders of flour to be exported to our Company they wish some assurance that our supplies are not included in the amount allotted to Bahrein. of flour locally. We used to secure our requirements from the United States, but this source is not now available to us. We have secured some flour from South Africa but export from there is also now prohibited. At the present time we have an order on Australia but due to transportation difficulties its receipt here is extremely uncertain. In view of the conditions outlined above it appears very important that we now be able to secure our flour from India. included in any general quota set for Bahrein Island. We shall very much appreciate receiving advice from you confirming this fact in order that we may give Caltex (India) Limited the information they need in arranging for the export of flour to us from India* The requirements of flour above referred to are for the Staff members of the Company and also the families resident in Awali. As you are aware, we have not been purchasing our supplies It is our understanding that our requirements have not been WAG: CDS.\ f THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN: 7th September, 1942., 25th Sha'bfai, 1361., //f f(\&gt;) y t' In reference to your B.O.No.C/1306 of the 30-8-42., I take pleasure in informing you that all the merchants concerned have been interviewed and informed of each one’s share in the sanctioned quota of exports to Bahrein; and they were invited to express a preference between column 5. and column 6. It is extremely interesting to record that all these concerned agreed to import their shares in accordance wit! the list of exporters in India supplied by the Government of India in column six, with the following exceptions: 1. Messrs D. Hemandas desire to import their Karachi quota from no^rrom Hajy Suliman Adam Kothari, which of course is not surprising, as both are Hindu firms; and.... 2. Messrs Haridas Janimal desire to import the whole of their quota of 80 tons of Calcutta Rice from Mahdavlal &amp; Co., thus cancelling the 20 tons allotted to them from Hajy Ebrahim Yusuf Zainal Alireza. This also is not surprising for the same reason. Apart from these, there are no comments to be made; and the preparation of the October programme is proceeding on these lines. I note, however, that your allocations have been made on the basis of the past three years; and I agree that this gives a juster appreciation of the situation than figures for previous periods of three years which did not take into account reserves of stock.

Political Agent. Bahrain* The Hon’ble the Polltloal Heeldent in the Perelan Gulf, . Buehlre• into Bargain of li.1 Sir, 1 have the honour to report that during recent months, and particularly since the Introduction of the quota system, the food situation In Bahrain has deteriorated so seriously that, unless Immediate and drastic steps are taken to ensure that essential foodstuffs reach the Island In considerable quantities, popular discontent, which is at present confined to comparatively Innocuous criticism of the existing rationing system, will reach a dangerous degree of unanimity and Intensity. If this should occur, the consequences will be grave. Anti-British elements of the population will come to the fore, the Shaikh will be rldl~ culed and abused for his loyalty to us, security Interests will be prejudiced, and, finally, Indian and local employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company will refuse to work unless rations are guaranteed to them, and the production of oil will certainly be Interrupted and may, indeed, cease altogether* 2* That these apprehensions are not unduly alarmist will be evident from the following facts and figures. Bahrain's normal Internal consumption of rice Is 739 tons monthly* Appli cation of the 205&amp; cut leaves a monthly quota of 591 tons, or 8072 bags* Imports of rice from India Into Bahrain for local consump tion during the last four completed months have been as followss- May June July August 554 bags 2035 bags 1705 bags bags / 3.• S' &lt;/ / 3. During the four months May to August inclusive Bahrain’s quota of rice for internal consumption was (4 x 8072) 32 f 288 bags* (The island*s normal consumption would have been 40 f 360 bags)* Out of the quota allotment of 32 1 288 bags Bahrain received only 4977 bags f or approximately 15% of its quota* 4* Before reverting to the parlous position of Bahrain Itself in respect of supplies of rice, a few words must be said about ship* ments of rice consigned to Bahrain for re-export to Saudi Arabia* The quota for rice shipped via Bahrain to Saudi Arabia has been fixed ^ at 713 tona, or 9739 bags* During the four months May to August inclusive the following consignments of rlee 9 marked R.k*, were received at Bahrain for onward shipment to Saudi Arabian portas- May 11038 bags June 7330 bags JUly 19011 bags August _ bags 5* Saudi Arabia’s quota for rice during this period amounts to (4 x 9739) 38,956 bags* At flrat sight it would appaar, there fore, that Saudi Arabia was securing shipment of its full quota of rlca whereas Bahrain was only obtaining shipment of 15% of its quota* As s matter of fact, this was not the ease* Of the Saudi Arabian quota of 9739 bags, 5914 bags were allotted to Karachi and 3825 bags to Calcutta* But little, If any, of the rice consigned to Bahrain for re-export to Saudi Arabia cams from Calcutta; all, or almost all | of it cams from Karachi and was dsblted at that port to the 'Bahrain quota” of 666 tons* This consolidated 'Bahrain quota”, it is of interest to note, la made up of the Saudi Arabian Karachi quota of 433 tona plus the Karachi quota for Bahrain proper of 233 tons* The Foreign Trade Controller at Karachi had not, up to the 11th September, received any intimation that there were separate quotas for Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Hla information was simply that the 'Bahrain quota” was 666 tons* Export licences for ship ments to Bahrain ware accordingly issued within the limits of this combined quota, and exporters ware at liberty to mark their shipments / B.E./ no . 3 . I H.B.ae and whan they plaaaad* Sinea profits wara controlled In Bahrain and uncontrolled In Saudi Arabia it was not, perhaps, unnatural that nearly 902 of the rice consigned to Bahrain during the eujwasr months was narked H#2« Unfortunately I was unaware, until 1 visited Karachi earlier this month, that no distinction was made by the authorities at that port between cargo for Bahrain proper and cargo In transit to Saudi Arabia via Bahrain* If I had had this knowledge 1 could, and should, have authorised the detention in Bahrain of such of the rice which actually want through to Saudi Arabia* 6* To rev art to the position in Bahrein* During May to August inclusive 4977 begs of rles (excluding consignments marksd R.E.; wsrs Imported into Bahrain from India* During September (up to the 20th of the month) 4 bags of rics have been imported, end one further bag of rice arrived marked R*2* Stocks of rice In the Island wars estimated e few days ego at 6,686 begs end will, unless further consignments are received In the meantime, be exhausted by the middle of October* The fact that there le any rice at ell In Bahrain at the present time le due to two facte* (I) At the end of April, before the lean period set in, there were substantial stocks of rlcs in Bahrain, amounting to nearly BO,000 bags* This stock was greatly depleted when the pearling fleet provisioned Itself for the season’s operations* (II) Some 10,500 bags of rice, marked H*B*,were purchased by the Bahrain Government from local merchants while the rice was, strictly speaking. In transit to Saudi Arabia* 7* Sines rles constltutss the staple food of the inhabitants of Bahrain It will be agreed, X think, that the dangers Inherent In the present position have not been over-emphasleed In the first paragraph of this letter* A solution to the problem cannot be found locally* The rice ration le only 12 Ibe* per adult per month, and can hardly be reduced further* Indeed, It le e popular grievance that the present ration Is Inadequate to ths needs of e healthy working man* I know of no substitute for / riceIV - 4_ xzj rlc«| and if 'the population of Bahrain are reduced to a diet of fiah and dates* supplemented by a small ration of wheat or flour, the consequences which I have envisaged earlier in this letter will indubitably ensue* 8* During ay recent visit to Karachi I was enabled* by the courtesy of the Foreign Trade Controller and his Assistant, to study the working of the quota ayatem from a new angle* This study provided me with the answer to many conundrums whioh it had baen beyond my power to solve in Bahrain. As a result of my in vestigations I came to the conclusion that there were, apart from minor misunderstandings susceptible of easy adjustment * two main factors , mutually inter-related, which operated to the disadvantage of Bahrain (and probably of other Gulf ports also) In the running of the quota syatam* In the first place, no one in Karachi is interested to see that quota goods for which axport lieancas have been issued are, in fact, exported. Secondly, shipping apaca la allotted to merchants proportionately to their demands and without regard to public requirements at the port of destination* Both these points require some elaboration* 9* Whan the Foreign Trade Controller allots to 'Approved Exporters* their quotas for a given month, tha quotas are communi cated to them In the form of Provisional Export Licences* These Export Licences are only valid for a period of two months, and, if they have not been used before the end of that period, they lapse on its expiry and cannot be renewed* If they have been partially used during the permitted period, they lapse at tha end of the period to the extent that they have not been used, and again no renewal is allowed. Bo one in Karachi la interested in seeing that a particular merchant uses his axport licence* The Export Trade Controller ie certainly not Interested; his duty is to ensure that quota goods are not exported in greater quantity than la permitted by the Government; his sphere of responsibility is not touched if quota goods are exported in lass - far lass - quantity than la permitted* It may be 'argued that It is to tha / advantageadvantage of a merchant possessing an export licence to make nee of it. This may or may not be the case. On too many occasions in the past it has not been the case. The reasons for a parti cular merchant 1 s failure to use an export licence may be one of many• Posaibly he has no stock of the goods for which he possesses an export licenee t (Export licences are issued to exporters on the approved list without their being called upon to produce evidence that they possess stocks of the commodity concerned) t and he may be unable to purchase stocks at a pries which will give him a profit. Possibly he has applied for an export licence aa a cheap speculation (hoping to make a bargain with another merchant who has got stocks hut no export licence) and is disappointed in his hopes, Posaibly the application of the holder of an export licence was bona fide, and he genuinely held stocks of the commodity covered by the licence, but was unable to obtain shipping space for the goods or, more likely, preferred to use the limited amount of shipping space allotted to him for the export of more profitable cargo. The possible reasons why export licences are not acted upon by their holders are numerous and varied - and the results are disastrous for the Gulf Sheikhdoms♦ Vital supplies, the very mininum necessary to sustain the populations of Bahrain and Qatar, Dubai and Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, are withheld because there is no one in the Indian Ports whose duty or interest it Is to ensure that supplies ear marked for the Persian Gulf are actually despatched there, 10, The second factor operating to the disadvantage of ports in the Persian Gulf is that, in the allotment of shipping space, no regard is paid to the relative importance, at the place of destination, of the goods being shipped. Thousands of eases of tea, large quantities of spices, coffee, plecegoods etc. have been shipped in recent months to Bahrain and the Trucial Coast when the only real need was for rics and flour. The main reason for this anomaly is that prices of flour and rice are everywhere controlled, and re-export is not allowed. Merchants' profits in respect of / these/ 12. MM ■- these cofikuoditlee are therefore strictly Halted* On other commodity lee, of which there le locally an adequate supply y no export ben la imposed and very large profits can be made on reexported goods* normally the price of any particular commodity falls whan that commodity ia in good supply y and merchants tend automatically to import goods of which there is locally a shortage* But recently an axaotly opposite tendency has been shown by importing merchants* For inst&amp;ncet there are large stocks of tea at Dubai* Merchants are therefore importing more and more tea into Dubai knowing that re export will be allowed and that they can make big profits by selling the tee in Iran or Iraq* Ho doubt they place orders for rice also on their Karachi agents; but those agents know well enough what ship ments will prove the most profitable, and enormous cargoes of tea etc., unwanted on the Trucial Coast, shut out the bags of rlca so urgently needed there* 11* I do not know whether at Karachi Messrs* MacKinnon Mackenzie, if they were advised of the needs of individual ports in the Persian Gulf, would be in a position, when allotting shipping space, to give priority to certain goods* In any cess, such an arrangement would not go nearly far enough as the particular applleatlone for shipping space which they received might not include the goods to which prior ity was to be given* I can only suggest that an agent be appointed in each port, or at least in Karachi, to watch the interests of Bah rain (or possibly of all Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms), and to ensure that thoee interests are protected. Such an agent, given the necessary authority, could see that export licences for quota goods were either acted upon by the licencees within a stipulated period or surrendered for re-issue to exporters who would act on them. Hs could, moreover, recommend the removal from the list of 'Approved Exporters* of the names of merchants trading in export licences or otherwise acting mala fide* He could, furthermore, in accordance with instructions Issued to him from time to time, advise Messrs* Maekinnon Mackenzie of the commodities most urgently required in particular areas so that shipping space could be allotted accordingly*IS* If these unsatisfactory features of the quota system could be eliminated, whether by the appointment of a Bahrain (or Persian Gulf) Trade Agent or otherwise, the system itself would run much more smoothly, and Bahrain might perhaps receive its allotted quotas of rice and flour. But, in present circumstances, this is not snough. Bahraini quota of rice from Karachi is only 233 tone, or 3182 bags. This is less than 40% of the total allotted quota of 591 tons, or 8072 bags, which itself represents a reduction of 20% on normal con sumption. Sither the population of Bahrain must resign itself to “&gt;a ration of some 5 lbs. of rice per head per month, with the con- sequences which I have sketched earlier in this letter, or steps must be taken to provide from some other source the quota of rice from Calcutta (358 tons or 4890 bags) which is no longer available. I make tentatively the suggestion that, if rice can by no means be supplied in sufficient quantities from India, an effort might be made to secure supplies from Iraq. It is understood that the rice crop in the Middle Euphrates area has been exceptionally good this year, the yield being estimated at 100,000 tons, and, if an approach to the Iraq Government through official channels is considered un desirable, His Highness the Shaikh could no doubt make an appeal ad misericordiam to Hurl Pasha with whom he is on friendly terms. 13. In conclusion, I express regret both for the length of ^fchis letter and for its unpelatable contents and presagings. But Bahrain has acquired a position of such importance in relation to the War that I have thought it imperative, before the position becomes irretrievable, to acquaint you with the dangers with which this island and its people are so imminently confronted, and to attempt some analysis of the factors which have contributed to the present unhappy situation. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, BahrainNo. of 1361 Y 'Xy Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Ramadhan 13, 1361 September 24, 1942. ilemorandum:- H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. With reference to your memorandum No.0/1438 dated 23rd September, 1942, enclosing copies of letter which have passed between yourself and the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. The present ration, during the month of Ramadhan, is 4 lbs of flour and 4 lbs of wheat. This ration wqs recommended by the Food Committee and approved by His Highness Shaikh Salman at the end of last month. It was announced to the public by broadcast. The wheat has been issued to the public since then but it appears from the Chief Local Representative’ that his Indian employees have not availed themselves of hi its. It is not difficult to grind it locally. In almost every house hold there is a grinding stone and these are being used in the towns and villages for grinding the wheat ration into flour. There are many people who are willing to grind wheat for a small fee. In para 4 of the Chief Local Representative's letter there is a reference to the time-lag in the issue of ration cards. This matter was pointed out by Mr. Grisewood to the Director 0 -. Customs some time ago and since then ration cards have been dated from the expiration of one month from the previous issue so that no days are missed.

Local merchants complain established shippers are not sending commodities ordered through them and think that they are using licences themselves instead of shipping for importers. Britagent.Telegram From S Political Bahrain To Foreign New Delhi No.646 Dated 27th September 1942 niPCKTANT. Following from Hay* Shortage of one or more essential foodstuffs (viz. rice wheat and flour) is serious in Bahrain and likely to become serious in other Shaikhdoms owing to non-receipt of quotas. Consignments of tea, piece-goods etc. which are not required are arriving but not essential food-stuffs. Reason is believed to be that exporting firms in Karachi and other ports prefer to ship goods which are not so closely controlled at this end on which therefore there are larger profits to be made and apply for shipping space accordingly. As far as is known Gulf importing firms are not to blame and in any case they can be dealt with at this end. Very little rice indeed has been received at Bahrain and Kuwait during last two months and it is doubtful if any of this was against July or August quotas. There has also been serious deficien cy in delivery of wheat and flour at Bahrain. 2. Situation is even more critical in respect of essential food-stuffs for Saudi Arabia and Griffin who is now in Bahrain has asked me to represent case to Government of India. 3. I would suggest that Shipping Controller at Karachi be instructed not to allot space for non-quota goods until all quota goods outstanding have been shipped and so far as quota goods are concerned to give preference to cereals over sugar. 4. So far as established shippers are concerned I suggest they should be warned that if they fail deliberately or through negligence to export quotas allotted to them grant / of- 2 - of shipping space for all goods will be refused to them. If this expedient fails it will be necessary to press for re consideration of proposal previously made in respect of Kuwait that each Shaikhdom should appoint its own agent in each port for export of quota goods. If food situation is allowed to become really acute in Shaikhdoms or Saudi Arabia serious political repercussions are inevitable. 5. I would also request that where an export permit for quota goods has lapsed under the two months rule the Gulf Shaikhdoms and Saudi Arabia should not thereby be deprived of essential supplies but that either the permit should be renewed or a new permit issued to another firm for the same goods against the same quota. 6.

H. B. M’s Political A^ent, Bahrain. G Memorandum:- p' With reference to your Memorandum No.C/1472 dated 30th September, 1942, enquiring v/hether it would be practicable to substitute rice by flour as a temporary measure. 2. Rice is now the staple diet of the Arabs of Bahrain though in the past, thirty or forty years ago, it was not greatly used. It is the principal food for provisioning the diving fleet. Some of the foreign communities, which are small and the Persians, who number about 7000, would be equally satisfied with rice or wheat, provided that they could buy flour or bread. The prospect of being unable to obtain rice would be extremely distasteful to the Arabs. Sven if they knew that there was a sufficient supply of wheat they would be greatly disturbed if rice was unobtain able. I believe the substitution of wheat for rice would not be detrimental to their health but having become accustomed to a diet of rice they would take hardly to being unable to obtain rice. 3. I have sounded several Arabs on the subject and the general opinion is that an equal weight of flour or rice will satisfy the consumer though a smaller quantity of rice produces satisfaction more rapidly than bread or wheat porridge.4. The present price of Indian flour which is on sale in the bazaar is As. -/10/- per rub*a and the price of Karachi rice now available As -/14/- per rub*a. If the wheat which may be sent from India produces flour at the same price as the Indian flour which is being sold here now it will be cheaper for the public to use flour instead of rice. It would not be cheaper for them to use the Canadian wheat which is of superior quality to wheat imported from India or neighbouring countries. The price of Canadian wheat is As -/ll/6 per rub*a. 5. I think the substitution of wheat for rice would be extremely unpopular and would provoke a considerable outcry but if the public are told that rice for the time being is unobtainable from India and if other States in the Gulf are treated in the same way and receive no rice I believe the public would accept the situation as an unpleasant outcome of the war.

I beg to infom you that on the Trucial Coast rice forms the larger diet of the local people and they depend chiefly on it. Rice is also cheaper for the local people to live on. If there is no alternative the local people, can, howwver, adopt themselves so as to have one rice meal instead of two per day and one of bread. If this procedure is adopted the present quota fixed for the Trucial Coast can be reduced to half and for the balance extra supply of — wheat, and more preferably flour, is given instead, 0^- Residency agent, Sharjah,. ■I kj : Bahrain and on Trucial Coast flour would be preferable to wheat. Bahrain and Trucial Coast Arabs would probably acquiesce quietly in twenty five per cent substitution of flour far rice and even fifty per cent substitution could be enforced temporarily if publicity were given to reasons for alteration in rations and if all Shaikh- doms and Saudi Arabia were given equal treatment. Substitution to greater degree than fifty per cent would undoubtedly provoke serious unrest among Arabs.

I explained the contents of the letter to Kis Highness Shaikh Salman. His Highness has already discussed the question of quotas with me and with his uncles and with a number of the Bahrain and foreign merchants and he wishes me to express his views to you in this letter. His Highness is strongly opposed to any system which creates a monopoly of trade in certain essential foodstuffs. Many Bahrain merchants, both Bahrain sub jects and foreigners, have complained to him saying that they wish to import rice and flour but as they have not been trading in these commodities for a number of years, or in some cases not at all, they fear that they will not able to obtain a share in the quota. Among the principal persons whose cases have been considered by His Highness are Abdulaziz al Kosaibi, Yousuf Kanoo, Khalil Kanoo and Khalil al Moayad. His Highness would like all merchants who wish to trade in rice and flour to be given the opportunity of importing from India irrespective of whether they have traded in the past or His Highness would like his Government to be allowed to purchase and import the full quota of rice and flour@&gt; - 2 - 1 every month and then to distribute it among the Bahrain merchants for sale to the public. He thinks that this would be the most satisfactory method. IOLl. / Regarding the Tist encldsed in your letter, His Highness wishes to know why such a large proportion r-v of the quota has been alotted to Mohamed el llarzook jLMJSlIlJk and his partner Abdul Aziz al Bassam, His Highness would like to divide most of the amount allocated to Marzook and Bassam among other Bahrain merchants who are not at present included on the list. I should say that His Highness is not commenting on the arrangements for RE cargo but his remarks refer only to direct imports for Bahrain. Yours sincerely, \ / Captain M. G.

Dear Sir, Our New York office advises that there is a possibility that rice can be obtained in the United States at $180 per ton; adding transportation and handling costs would bring the price to approximately $170/180 per ton.

A detailed note on ex port proceedure has been sent to the Director of Customs, of which para 11 deals with the, question of “quota months* 1 .

Sir, I have the honour to request that the attention of the Bahrain Government may be drawn to the imperative necessity of conserving all supplies of essential foodstuffs. In regard to rice, wheat and flour I believe this necessity is realised, as the Island has already experienced a shortage of these commodities. In regard to sugar, however, the fact that the Bahrain Government controls supplies which should be sufficient for several months may lead to a misapprehension about the real position. Stocks of Java sugar in India are practically exhausted, and it is not yet known to what extent, if any, sugar grown in India will be available for export. As stocks of sugar In Bahrain are used up, it will be necessary to obtain the assistance of the Government of India in obtaining fresh supplies. Such assistance will, I am sure, be forthcoming; but it will be forthcoming with greater readiness if I am in a position to assure the Government of India that sugar has been, and is being, used sparingly, and that no exports to Iran, Iraq etc. have been allowed except against Imports of other essential foodstuffs.

When I asked Mr. de Grenier on what basis his Loading Programmes for essential which I gather that he meant his own. When asked for details of the procedure, he said that importers had first been asked to state what orders they proposed to place during the month in question. When these figures were received and (presumably) found considerably to exceed the sanctioned quota, the importers were then asked to state ,f what they could do'. All the I am'. Mr. de Grenier expressed horror at the he said, would be too long a process. He was unable to say whether and to what extent the new figures which he brought this morning co incided with the figures given in previous Load ing Programmes. At one stage he appeared to resent the cross examination to which he was being put, but he saw the point when I explained to him that the Government of India had placed on Political Agents the responsibility of allocat ing allotments of quota exports and that it would be to this Agency that merchants would protest if they thought they had not been given their share• /l.a/48. 3- The question, raised by P.A* in his note of the 9th August regarding the issue of flour to bakers,was also discussed. Mr. Belgrave tells me that a plan is being evolved whereby a number of bakers will be employed and paid by the Bahrain Government to make all the Island^ bread requirements. The Bahrain Government will issue the wheat or flour as the case may be (purchasing the latter from the merchants at the controlled price,) to the bakers, who will make the bread for the Bahrain Government. The latter will then sell the bread to selected shopkeepers of the Munici- % paiitjAwho will sell the bread to the public. Periodical visits by Municipal Inspectors will ensure against profit eering. This scheme is still in the embryo stage and in a week’s time we might write and ask the Adviser for details of it. In the first instance it will embrace Manama and Muharraq only but will later cover the whole Island. Flour rations will then no longer be issued to individuals. 4 . I was unable to get an opportunity of speaking to the Adviser about the point raised at B in S (5). Please remind me about this point when writing the reply to the P.R.’s enquiries about the alleged inefficiency etc. of the Food Controller and his staff.V Pp. U.C. may be filed. ^ Reference para 2 of my note of the 22nd. As it seemed to be impossible to get any figures out of the Customs (vide the reply to my D.O. letter of the 22nd August, which may be filed,) there was nothing for it but to send for the merchants - those named in the list produced by Mr. de Grenier with additions suggested by the Head Munshi, - and obtain from them* lists of their imports of the main commodities from India in the last 3 years. They were not told what these were required for, but presum ably guessed; however, the addition of the figures supplied by them gave totals remarkably close to the total figures given in Bahrain Trade Reports, so perhaps they were not unduly ,, cooked w . The Draft to Mr. de Grenier, which ex plains itself, may issue, together with the draft to Mr. Belgrave below. There will be a number of questions for decision in this connexion, after P.A.*s return:- (a) whether we should give permanent quotas to our importers at all. The Government of India’s instructions are merely concerned with the fixing of quotas for exporters, but it seems to me desirable’“that permanent ^iota/|should straightened out, latitude poaeiblrc-tfr the Customs Head Clerk, who would otherwise be in a position to change the lists monthly as he thought fit. (b) Whether such men as Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz A1 Qosaibi, who have not engaged in the food trade for many years past but now wish to do so as they find it more pro fitable than their ordinary line of business, should be in cluded in the quotas. I understand that Qosaibi has approached Shaikh Salman in this connection and that the latter is disposed to back his cause. (c) Whether r on the other hand, as alleged by Haridas Janimal in the letter of which a copy is to accompany the draft, the result of taking only the figures of the last 3 years has been detrimental to the interests of those merchants / whoM - 2 - who regularly Imported before the war. Cd) Whether it is necessary for the fig ures supplied to me tp be checked by the Direct or of Customs, if they are to be accepted as the basis for our quota allotments. There would in any case not be time for this to be done before sending in our lists of October allotments. 3. As regards para 5 of the draft to the Director of Customs I am not at present absolute ly clear to what extent Bahrain merchants will find it difficult to deal with exporters in India with whom they have not previously dealt. Some of them, e.g. Abdul Aziz Ali A1 Bassam, (who is, I gather, to a large extent operating in partnership with Mohamed El-Marzook of Karachi,) talked as though such a thing was impossible; Dhamanmal Isardas on the other hand said that under the new system he was prepared to import from anybody^ other Hindus have said the same. I imagine that, under the new arrangement^ except for those who have their own firms in Karachi Calcutta or Bombay as the case may be,(e.g.Rattanchand Dipchand, D. Hemandas and Governdas Dharamdas,) merchants should find no great difficulty in changing their exporters, (if that is necessary to accord with the Government of Indian list.) The transactions in India are carried on through brokers and, provided that the eaiporting firms 4 are prepared to accept payment 'on presentation of documents' (i.e. Bill of Lading, Insurance Policy and Invoice,) and do not insist on being made in advance, and that the sys tem is properly worked (vide the separate note recorded on the procedure at Karachi,) it should not matter to a Bahrain merchant l! N, : i jH 8 NI saw both Mr. Kakumal of Haridas Jani- mal and the Naval Contractor this morning. They explained that the object of marking 250 bags of flour RE was so that funds might be provided for the contractor to buy vegetables for the Navy in Qatif* the initial suggestion came from the Contractor. The flour was consigned to Haridas Janimal's firm in Qatif; on the under standing that the firm would supply him with rupees^u'^'^r the value of the consignment without charging the usual 5% exchange on rupee drafts _ ^ cv* on — -'' 379/42 . 1 %.c\ t' N O 1 e h ej . e| ; „ -6.0.* /-i— t'vut ^ - 4r /VtU-s— The following two questions in connec tion with food supplies for BAPCO were discussed this morning with Messrs. Anderson and Belgraver (a) Flour. The Company are now down to 3 months* supply of flour for their Staff per sonnel and are finding it a great drain on their reserve giving bread to their Indian employees. They are hoping that a fresh supply of flour may soon come in from Australia, but there is no in dication of when it is liekly to arrive. They will continue for a week or two to give bread to their Indian employees, but unless fresh flour arrives in the meantime they will then have to cease doing so.j m l.a/48. G*?- n (b) Rice* The Company will also soon be running short of rice and will not thereafter be replenishing their stocks. At the moment, in addition to the Staff personnel, about 90 domestic.servants are given rice from the Company's own supplies, but Mr.’ Belgrave agreed that, when this came to an end, th^doraestics could obtain Bahrain ration cards, as they (unlike Staff personnel) had bought from the Bahrain market previous to the War and were therefore included in the figures on which Bahrain’s quota was based* .The ration that these domestics are given in Awali is 15 lbs. a month, as against the original ration of 22% lbs. and the present ration of 12 lbs. given by the Food Controller.

I have interviewed 22 merchants in connection with the Re-export of quota commodities to Saudi Arabia. 13 are those who were given R.S. allotments in the lists prepared here and forwarded to the Director of Customs at the end of August, 5 more (Hussein Ali Kazem Bushiri, Khalil Dav/am, Ishwardas Vasandmal, Abbas Kazeruni and Soverdhandas Sharamdasj) had been given allotments for Bahrain but not for R.3. in those lists and desired B.d. allotments now; while the remaining 4 (Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz al Qoseibi, Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo, Haj Mohamad Taher Khunji and TT aj Kohamed A.^abi o Bushiri,) have not been dealing in foodstuffs in the last fev\T years but had previously dealt with then at one time or another and desired to do so now. the remaining merchants, (other than the 5 named above,) who had been given allotments *■ * for Bahrain but not for in the August lists, do not (it was ascertained through H.r.,) wish to engage ?^n the R.ji. trade of quota commodities. 2. Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo did not wish to re-export if he could import for Bahrain and has therefore been omitted irom the Re-Exporters. Yusuf Yakhroo was not prepared to give any guarantee that he would order the allotments made to him and furthermore was unwilling to buy from anyone in Karachi save Fahad el Marzook, and he has therefore been omitted. The remaining merchants accepted the terms for R.-'j. (which were explained to them in case there was any douot, and undertook to place orders in India for whatever allotments were made to them. -Lhe smaller merchants expressed a unan imous preference for a small quota every month rather then 3 months ! quota in one month followed by noth: ng in t.ie next two. The general consensus of opinion was that 5C bags was the smallest consignment of any bulk commodity^that could be conveniently and economically sent in a single consign ment. 3. The merchants expressed inability to divide the quotas among themselves and 'allotments were therefore m^de bjAgency, based principally on the figures in column 4 of the lists prepared in August but giving somewhat higher figures to those who had been re-exporters in the oast. The allotments were made known to the merchants, at a subsequent meeting held yesterday, and the basis of them was briefly explained to them; they again undertook to place orders accordingly. Lists, approved by P.A., were sent to the Export Trade Controller, Karachi, and copies of then are now being circulated to the merchants concerned to ensure' against confusion. 4. Only for the two principal commodities, rice and flour, were lists prepared by me; in the case of last barley and grains and pulses the lists/sent by the Director of Customs were followed.- The Adviser should be informed of this fact as regards imports for Bahrain In the case of these lesser commodities the allotments given to shippers in India coincided with those sent to us by the Government of India; in the case of rice and flour they are as follows Rice Flour Mohd. el Mar zook 260 Ravji Jhaverchand 25 Hiranand Versimal 25 3aud A.A.Fulaij 15 Lalji Lakhmidas 70 Mohd.

All the merchants wishing to re-export quota commodities were given allotments except Goverdhandas Dharamdas, who expressed his unwillingness to export from anyone other than his own firm, Dharamdas Thawar- das. The 4 tons of flour which he had been allotted were therefore added on, one ton each, to thenr^ allotments of Abdulaziz Ali al Bassam, Suleman Hamad al Bassam, Dhamanmal Isardas and Ishwardas Vasandmal. A letter has since been received from Boverdhandas Dharamdas to say that he is prepared to export from anyone, but it arrived too late to be taken into consideration in regard to the October quota. I will deal with it on return of the file. 6. The merchants were informed at the first meeting that, though there were at present no signs of when the export of rice from Calcutta, which we had been informed was 'temporarily impossible', would again become possible, we should arrange for the distribution of the Calcutta rice quotas in the hope of its being re-started. An allotment was therefore prepared, but it was not announced in view of the latest telegrams re: a special shipment of rice from Calcutta. 7. As regards sugar, the merchants generally expressed unwillingness to export from India, as they say there are adequate stocks in Hasa, Jubail and Qatif, where the price is now Rs 95 per bag, as against Fs 100 per bag wholesale at Bombay, and, in view of the absence of demand yet in . Saudi Arabia, it would be uneconomic to bring it there. 1 pointed out that they, the merchants, would not be concerned with the sugar after its arrival in Bahrain and transfer to Messrs. Gray Tackenzie. The question of kkx allotting the quota among the merchants did not arise, as the 'estab- ♦ lished shippers' system has not yet been aoolied to Java sugar; ^Government of India are being asked whether it applies to Indian sugar. I subsequently spoke to Mfc.Tikamdas of Dhamanmal Isardas about sugar and he said that his Cal cutta branch would apply for an export licence for the full October sugar quota— less the amount apolied for by other merchants. I imagine that it is the. high cost of sugar in Bombay and the consequent difficulty of providing capital for its purchase in any quantity there that renders merchants disinclined to bring sugar for B</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00038b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/172</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00038b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/172</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 1/A/48 IV FOOD SUPPLIES.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1942/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-12-21T18:21:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">guj</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (330 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file, except where enclosures of an earlier date are filed after their relevant covering letter, and terminate in a set of notes (folios 309-331).
