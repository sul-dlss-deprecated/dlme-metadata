Had I taken this view the tone of this letter would of course have been ouite different. 4o it is, however, I am indeed only too pleased to be ableLyrrjtjkzr . unaer 3e private ^ry oi state etary, Please see the Secretary ot State’s note on Tehran despatch No*491 oi sQth October below* I venture to n&amp;ke the following comments: (a) Vfrile conditions in Tehran have admittedly altered ■&lt;2_ materially since 19^0, and particularly since ifeiza Khan ascended the throne, the alteration in conditions in the Gulf has been very much less marked. It is true that the opening of the air route has brought the Sheikhs of the Arab coast into a direct contact with western civilization ana that oil developments in Koweit, Bahrein ana ^atar have also hud or are likely to have the result of opening out those principalities increasingly in the near future. But the Trucial Coast remains for practical purposes, as Colonel Barrett described it in 1928, to some extent living in the seventh century, ana while Bahrein, Koweit ana muscat (and, to a much lesser extent, Qatar) are more in the world, they are still essentially Arab Sheikhs, more or less enllgnteneu, but ruling populations the basis of whose existence has not materially changed for centuries; who draw their own straightforward inferences, which may be wrong, but of which it is difficult to disabuse them, from our action or lack of action vis-^-vis Persia; our failure or success in defending their interests (e.g. their shows) against the Persian Navy, etc. while, therefore, as Mr* Pallet says, we must, in dealing with Persia, deal with it at any rate In name as a western nation and apply western standards, it is still necessary to apply standards much more primitive in character to the Arab littoral of the Gulf. (b)/* o (lg) 4. (t)) IX on occasion (there were signs of this at one stage during the suumer) the Gulf shows an insufficient appreciation of the difficulties of the position of the minister at Tehran and the policy which he has to pursue t there is also the other danger, which,' on a distant view, is not less great, that Tehran does not fully appreciate that the Gulf is not merely an appendage of fersia, action in which must he subordinated in all circumstances to considerations of Persian policy• The essential importance of the Gulf to H.ti.G* is as the air highway to the £.ast and as commanding one of the flanks of India. It is secondarily important because of the possibility that difficulties either with Ibn Saua or with the other rulers of the Gulf may have Jwohanmedan reactions of consequence. Finally, our position being to a lesser extent than is desirable based on formal treaties and to a very considerable extant based on prestige and custom, we cannot lightly afford to pass over incidents which, however, unimportant in themselves, may, in the special circumstances of the An b littoral, have an effect disproportionately great on our position and prestige. 3. on the question of the attitude to be adopted towards Persia, it is no doubt inevitable, as kr.toilet says, that we should to some extent pursue a policy of playing up to Persian vanity. But there are limits to the extent to which we should go ana there Is always the aariger that by adopting a too accommodating attitude we may encourage the Persians to take liberties and press points to an extent which they would not otherwise do. lir.toilet is// # o *Yes. And ■ moral seems be that we should now atti' that we are not saltars. 'Do v* c? i Q * for Persia friendship.

J.C.W. satisfactory settlement, we have now exhausted the list of concessions which can be made to Persia and if a treaty cannot he obtained in return for wnat we are prepared to concede any hope of it must he abandoned. 4. Our main hostage to Persia at the moment is the A.P.O.C.'s oil. So long as we are dependent for oil supplies to so large an extent on an oil field in Persian territory we must walk carefully (though the Department has consistently held tne view that the 3hah is very unlikely to press a policy of pin-pricks in that area to a point which will conflict with his own interests, and the Company^ position is, of course, stronger internationally as a result of the agreement recently reached with the Persian Government.)

Foreign Office, Reference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure.[E 6756/1329/34] No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon—{Received November 6.) (No. 491.) Tehran, October 20, 1933. ' RECENT events in the Persian Gulf have unfortunately once more shown how wide a divergence of view exists almost inevitably between those members of His Maiesty’s services whose duty it is to watch events in Persia from the different angles of Tehran and the Gulf ports. It is useless to ignore the tact that this divergence exists, but it may be of use to attempt to examine the i eason for it and to search for the means of greater harmony in the future. 2. The difference of view is due partly to training and partly to environment As regards the former, the diplomatic stall at Tehran has usually no experience of the administration of oriental peoples which forms part ot the training of officers of the Indian Political Service. Its members are accustomed to treat with officials of foreign Governments on terms of at least outward and nominal equality. Diplomacy knows of no subject races; it must not openly admit the existence of racial or colour prejudice; it cannot ignore the framework of the League of Nations within which its post-war activities are confined, where all nations are equal under the Co\enant. . 3 As regards environment, we at Tehran have to deal with a I ersian Government admittedly below that level of civilisation to which a diplomat is accustomed, though perhaps no lower than that of some of the Central and South American republics. Nevertheless, to us the Minister for Foreign Affairs represents the Persian Government, just as you, Sir are His Majesty s Government as far as the Persian Legation is concerned The decencies and courtesies of diplomatic intercourse have to be observed punctiliously. the diplomatic missions plav the game of diplomacy, with its social round and official decorum, as far as possible unaffected by the fact that they are living in a country still barely outside the confines of barbary. . 4. In the Persian Gulf, however, life still goes on rather in the old way, far from Tehran and its new streets and new methods of government, but near the waters in which the British navy has held unchallenged supremacy for more than a century. The Gulf is still, in fact, to some degree an apanage of our Indian Empire, and the Political Resident is the visible sign of that Empire s grip 0 n the Gulf. He still enjoys that halo of prestige which comes of the proximity of armed force. The halo has become less conspicuous of late—like a Titian halo to that of a Fra Angelico—but it is still rather nebulously there. At Tehran, however, we discarded halos about the time the Persians took to Pahlavi hats For instance, our escort of sowars has gone; I would not wish for it back. It used to impress the Persians; it would now merely irritate them as a bygone relic of “ imperialism.” For the modern Persian who has travelled abroad realises how people—even how diplomats behave in European count lies. Infected by the Turkish bacillus, he wishes to be treated as an occidental, lo treat him as an Indian is a deadly insult. . . i 5 So we pretend that the Persian is an occidental, and we try to play the game of diplomacy according to the rules of the Congress of Vienna. We have, in fact, given up the idea that you can bluff and bully the modern Persian. Perhaps we have learnt much from the Soviet Government in this respect. Ihe Russians succeeded in the past by ignoring colour prejudice We may succeed in the future by pretending to an Aryan kinship which Hitler would certainly not willingly claim. _ , . , ^ 6. In the eyes of many people this post-war policy of playing up to Persian vanity is despicable and wrong. If it is, the excuse for it must be that it was at least inevitable. Our military prestige—greater than ever before m our history at the armistice—dwindled quickly enough as our legions withdrew from the confines of Russia and our improvised fleet from the Caspian; it vanished on the day of the surrender at Enzeli. The prestige of West over East, on which [971 f—7]Britain’s strength in oriental countries so largely rested, had already been rudely shaken in the Islamic world when the Christian nations embarked in the World War with all its barbarous consequences. 7. New Persia has no use for foreigners, who claim a special position. She has still, however, need for friends, the Shah himself probably knows this well enough. He will never make friends with the Soviet Government. To whom, then, must he turn ? 8. Yet, though we have helped him greatly since he came to the throne, our help has been passive rather than active. We have waited to have successive concessions wrung from us. We have given way, always a little too late, over tarih's and Capitulations; we have shown no marked enthusiasm at Persia’s military progress, at her attempts to create a navy and an air force. Our gifts have been grudgingly given and accepted without gratitude. 9. Meanwhile, Persia has acquired self-confidence. She is, in her own eyes, quite a military Power. She is a member of the League, no doubt considered quite a personage by the smaller Powers represented at Geneva. This admission into wider social circles has brought her a host of new diplomatic missions to Tehran, whose only utility seems to be to flatter Persian vanity. Best of all, Persia now feels that if either of the big neighbours tries to browbeat her there is a hope of salvation by appealing to the sympathy of the smaller nations at Geneva, who are jealous of the preponderant influence of the greater Powers. 10. An event in the Gulf, such as the flag incident at Basidu, is rightly examined by the Political Resident and his subordinates from the dual point of view of its eftect upon Persian and Arab opinion. Admittedly it is of importance that the Arab rulers should not become unsettled. But it is of no special importance, as far as our Persian policy is concerned, whether the Persian dwellers on the northern shores of the Gulf are impressed or the reverse by the action or inaction of His Majesty’s ships. What matters in Persia is the effect on the Shah. He is, it is true, remote from the Gulf, but his writ does definitely run throughout his kingdom. He is too remote to be alarmed at anything our fleet does in the Gulf short of a definite act of war, but he is just near enough to be mortally insulted and furiously angry. “ 'reaching the Persians a sharp lesson,” and “ reasserting our authority,” may help materially in bringing to heel a recalcitrant Arab sheikh across the water, but it does not have at all the same effect on Reza Shah. It may merely result in the disappearance of whatever friendly Ministers may surround him at the time and their replacement by men sworn to enmity against Great Britain, and therefore ready to play the Russian game. It merely means that the next spinning mill will not be ordered in England but elsewhere, that the next aeroplanes will not come from British but from foreign factories. 11. The point is that the Shah is a rabid nationalist, and any action by a foreign Power which can be twisted into an insult to him or a threat to the independence of any part of his dominions merely makes him more obstinate than ever and more anxious to find means of retaliation. 12. Tension in the Gulf between the British navy and the embryo Persian fleet can only produce fresh crops of incidents, but any signs of real friendliness on our part will cause real pleasure to the Shah. 13. As regards incidents, we must, I fear, be patient. They will not cease automatically; the Persia n officers are ignorant and arrogant; the Customs Administration is haunted by the spectre of smuggling; the Shah is grumbling at the decreased customs revenues and enjoining greater zeal. Any prohibitionist policy must breed bootleggers. I find it hard to believe that the Arab sheikhs, our friends, are not profiting by the contraband traffic carried out by their subjects. It is an old game, played long ago by Queen Elizabeth. The Persian fleet no doubt have at times exceeded their rights, especially in searching dhows on the high seas. We must in such cases point out the fact to the Persian Government, but I urge that we should do so now. as formerly, in a friendly and good-tempered way, and not ourselves make matters worse by using force where sarcasm and humour might possibly suffice. 14. There will always be a time-lag between Tehran and the Gulf. The new spirit which may be expected to follow the conclusion of a treaty would arrive late and somewhat diluted in Bushire and Mohammerah, hut, with a treaty in operation, I see no reason why many questions which riotv are referred to Tehran could not be settled locally.['VIS) :i rudely in the m.

The main solution, as I see it, is to pursue as vigorously as possible the negotiations for a general treaty with Persia. Admittedly this is a task of astonishing difficulty, but we ought to attempt it in a most generous spirit. I he Shah is used to haggling, and he is quite good at getting a good deal of his way ^.fter hard bargaining, as witness the Anglo-Persian Oil Company settlement. %ven at the cost of further concessions, we ought, in my opinion, to make a serious effort to rebuild the ruins of our former military prestige on a new foundation of mutual confidence. Persia as a friend may be worth little to us, but, as anything less, she can be a great nuisance. 16. A treaty such as is contemplated would surely enhance out* position in the eyes of the x4rabs, whose status Persia would thereby have recognised, and we should have less need in the future of impressing them at the expense of our friendly relations with Persia. 17. An additional way of diminishing friction in the Persian Gulf over the activities of the Shah’s naval vessels would be the conclusion of a bilateral convention with the Persian Government on the subject of the control of the arms traffic in those waters. It might, if you so desire, be possible to stimulate the Persian Government to issue the necessary instructions to their representative at Geneva, though I am doubtful whether the instructions would entirely meet our views. Even the signature of such a convention would not. however, solve the problem of smuggling, on which Colonel Dickson’s report, enclosed in India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 4th July last, throws an interesting light. Sooner or later we shall find it necessary to do something to help the Persians in their attempt to check the contraband trade, which is flourishing in the Arab States, for whose foreign relations we are responsible.

But it is, 1 think, unfortunate that his previous service in the Gulf was at a period when our effective control and influence was quite abnormally high, viz. during the War period, when we were obviously in a position to make our weight felt without any difficulty vis-a-vis any recalcitrant sheikh. (Even at that period we had difficulty with the then Sheikh of Koweit). Moreover, he served there when the Gulf had for many years been governed by the strong personality of Sir Percy Cox. In the particular case of the Sheikh of Qatar, the Sheikh,, the treaty with whom had been negotiated by Sir Percy himself, had on the whole considerable reason for satisfaction with its terms, for they included a guarantee of protection against aggression by land which, when it came to the point, we were unwilling to implement save to the extent of diplomatic support. 2. Conditions have now, of course, radically changed. The Gulf is perhaps as important to us as it ever/2 ever was* But Persia emerged, temporarily at any rate, ^ as, in this area, a major state. The existence of the League of Nations and the change in the international position makes it desirable for us to stand on firm legal ground so far as possible (and our legal ground is not always too strong in the Gulf) and we have finally suffered from a series of changes in personnel. There have been six Residents, including the acting appointments of the late Colonel Barrett and of Colonel Loch himself, since 1928. It is to be hoped that the present Resident, who has so far given proofs of definite balance, whose relations with the Tehran Legation are very friendly, and who is highly thought of by tne Foreign Office, will be able, if his tenure is of a reasonable length, to pursue a continuous policy ^ ^7304 I Private and Personal. The Tesic^rcy, Bushire, the 12th October, 1933* 1933 Will you kindly refer to ’Fifthly* in my tele gram No.896 dated the 11th October 1933 about Basidu. 2 . I should like to give you an illustration of the change v;hich has taken place in the last, few years. Some sixteen years ago 1 accompanied the Deputy Political Resident (Bill) to Doha in Q,atar, with the fair copies of the Treaty with Q^tar for signature. Bill told the Shaikh that he had brought the ^reaty and that, before he asked him to sign it, the Head Munshi would read it out. The Head Munshi started to do so, but Shaikh ’Abdullah turn- j ed to Bill and asked him if the treaty was what he had initialled some months before. Bill explained that hese fair copies, which had been made in Simla, were exactly what he had initialled before. Shaikh ’Abdullah said that in that case there was no need to read them, he would sign them; and he did so. A year ago Prior took him a letter conveying an assurance in connection with the proposed landing ground and Shaikh 'Abdullah said that it was only signed hy the Resident, which was not enough. 3. It is a humiliating state of affairs, but all along the Arab Littoral they look at the Shaikh ol Mohammerah and the Shaikh of Kuwait and draw their own conclusions. 4 I am sending a copy of this lett er to Traser- Tytler.(zu P.

I entirely agree with you that the matter may now be regarded as closed. Incidentally, in a letter which reached me only yesterday, Clive remarked that Haworth had spent nearly a week with him and that he was in no Haworth had also suggested to Clive to come down to Bush ire to stay with him as he (Haworth) was , . t-l t J ^ T f- Vi vi a on nm o h.Vi ft h l 1.D. Vakely, Es^., C.B., li-BIA 0Fj 1 ICE.*t Please refer to your PriYate and Personal letter of 29th July, about Haworth’s odd behaviour over the report on the Consulates question. Since writing, you will have seen my pretty sharp telegram of the 19th July to Haworth drawing his attention to his subordination, as Consul General, to Tehran. I think this anticipated the action you suggest! in any case Haworth has cleared the air in his later despatch (Ho,248-3) and one gathers his present visit to Tehran is not unconnected with the amicable settlement of this and the other little differences which he, like most of his predecessors, has had with Tehran. To L.D*V7akely, Esquire, C.B., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London. / (With 2 spare copies.)V I. ^ / My dear Wakely, You. will remember that a short while ago I spoke to you about a despatch from Haworth at Bush ire to Clive at Tehran. I wonder whether you have found it possible to take any action, such as writing to Bray on the subject. My reason for asking is that, while the papers were sent to me, they really belong to another department Who need them back when co nvenient. L.D. Wakely Es&lt;i., C.B., India Office.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000d6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3652</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000d6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3652</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/76 'Divergent points of view on Persian Gulf affairs of Tehran Legation and Bushire Residency'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1927/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-25T10:50:38</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (35 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 37; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns different views on British policy in Persia and in the Persian Gulf between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the British Legation at Tehran.The file is composed of correspondence between the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, the British Legation at Tehran, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000d6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
