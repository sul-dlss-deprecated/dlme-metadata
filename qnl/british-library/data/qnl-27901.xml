Some months ago Ibn 3aud requested and India and Koweit have since agreed that the mails to or from Riyadh marked via Koweit should be transmitted via Koweit and not via Jedda. First mail despatched from Riyadh a few days ago but [grp. undec.] G-aury informs me that the Director General of Iraqi Post Office has refused mails from Riyadh via Iraqi Post Office in Koweit. I should be glad to be informed where the difficulty lies and whether objection is made on behalf of Iraq or of Post Office in Koweit which happens to be administered by Iraqi postal authorities. King is much worried by this delay. Repeated to Foreign Office telegram No. 161, (with reference , to Bushire telegram No. 360 July 6th to Secretary of State — for India) Koweit telegram No. 61.

You may recall that the procedure adopted in reaching an agreement about the Bahrein Transit Dues vms the following. His Majesty*s Minister at Jedda wrote to the Saudi- Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs making proposals for a local conference between Saudi-Arab!an delegates and representatives of the Bahrein Government at Bahrein. This conference was held and His Majesty*s Government were infomed of the settlement which was reached. The two parties to the settlement concluded it by an exchange of letters which/2 . which were communicated to the Political Agent Bahrein and the British Minister at Jedda. In the final event official notes embodying the substance of the Agreement were exchanged between the Saudi-Arabian Government and the British Minister at Jedda on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Bahrein. In the present instance there will be no need for these elaborate preliminaries since agreement on the point at issue has already been reached. But we should be glad to learn whether you think that the agreement might be formally concluded by such an exchange of notes, in order to avoid the need of obtaining, in respect of Koweit, the signature of the Iraqi Posts and Telegraphs Department. Ufa- should bo glad to- learn to- wha-t extent yobsihink some procedure such as the above (though course less elaborate) might suitably be ac^^uted in the present connection in order toav«*id any situation which would, in respect of Kbweit, necessitate the signature of the agreement b\the Iraqi- Poo to and-gelographo Yours sincerely.file copy FOREIGN OPPICE, S.W.l. 2nd August, 1939.

The Bombay office of exchange does not, however, prepare a direct bog for 3 uwait, articles for which are included by it in the weekly despatch made up for Basrah forward. The mode of the further transmission from R&amp;sr&amp;u to i\uwait is not known to this office. 3. It lias been ascertained that the Karachi l ost Office prepares a direct bag for Kuwait which it despatches weekly by the Slow Gulf Bteamers. As the call at Kuwait of these steamers is a fortnightly one, it is presumed that every alternate despatch to K uwait from Karachi is overcarried to B*&lt;sr&amp;h. If therefore it is considered preferable that articles for Kiyadh should be included in a direct bag prepared for Kuwait, they will be sent to Karachi for inclusion in the direct bag prepared for Kuwait by that office. The number of articles for Riyadh despatched each week by the Bombay office of exchange through Basrah Forward averages one letter.r ■3 2^0 In any further communication on this subject, please quote i _ , ,, *°£34-S~3/2w/z.j- — *jUa- I^MEDIATE. and address— not to any person byjianfe, buti to —— of '^tate 302 :• pipH for ELoreign Affairs presents his hMjJf. / &amp; THE Under-Seer compliments to an ^’ by direction of the Secretary of State, ' transmits herewith cop#^ of the under-mentioned paper Foreign Office, ,193^.
