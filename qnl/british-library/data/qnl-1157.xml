DATE ... 25th April, 1942 No.584/39/A The attached report fcf the sinking of (Sgd) H, A, BASS Major, R.M., Staff Officer (intelligence)( COPY ) (P COPY OP A SECRET REPORT No.C-1 DATED 14th APRIL. 1942, PROM THE at about midnight on 1£*4»42 that 35 crew or a vessel sunk by a submarine had arrived in a boat, I immediately proceeded to Malvan early next morning. On questioning the crew I was able to glean the following information, a summary of which I have already given Warwatch Malvan to communicate by wire to you. sailed with general cargo of tamrind, spices, coir yarn and timber from Calicut on 22.3.42 for Basrah and Khatar. The two vessels were the FATEH REHMAN of about 45 tons of Koweit, and the BOOM SAMHAN oi 49 tons of Khatar. Both these places are ports on the Eastern coast of Arabia about 250 miles apart. Koweit being near Basrah. Both dhows made Panjim for water on April 1st, 1942, and left on April 3rd, 1942. As winds were not favourable they sailed due west for 204 miles. On Ai-ril 9th at sunrise they sighted a large submarine about 600 yards away due North and heading towards them. Hie submarine loot no time in firing a few shells without any warning. Some fell short but one caught the FATEH REHMAN almost amidships and' she sank immediately. The submarine next tui’ned her attention to the BOOM SAMHAN and a couple of shells made her heel over and sent her crew scrambling into the water. Y/hile the BOOM SAMHAN was still lying on her side with the crew in the water, the submarine passed between both the struggling crews. The vessels at the tine they were fired on were about 150 yards apart. The Master of Hie BOOM SAMHAN who was still clinging to the side of his vessel, called out to the 3 or 4 men on the conning tower to save the crews. No notice was however taken and the submarine proceeded in a southerly direction. The Master of the BOOM SAMHAN is definite that the men on the tower of the submarine were not Japs but either Germans or Italians. The hull of the submarine was painted with bands of black, blue and black, one below the other. The jolly boat of the FATEH REHMAN sank with the vessel, as it also received a shell. The jolly boat of the BOOM SAMHAN being behind the overturned vessel was evidently not visible to the submarine, who probably expected both the vessels to be sunk without trace. As soon as the submarine fired, the crew waved their national flags, but again this was ignored. When the submarine left, the crews of both dhows got into the jolly boat of the BOOM SAMHAN and, after salving as much as they could from the heavily listing . vessel, they set sail for the coast; i.e. due East at 2 p.m. During the encounter with the submarine no other vessels of any sort were visible, in fact they did not encounter any vessels till the 12th the day they landed at Malvan. At about V p.m. a Vessel,VITHALPRASAD Malvan No.8031, at anchor outside Malvan, saw the jolly boat and piloted her into Malvan Harbour. 3. As the Master of the vessels were conversant with map reading, with the help of maps I was able to establish the position they met the submarine to be North Lat.lS^O* , Long. 70° 27* • 4. Three of the crew have been hurt by shell splinters and are in the local hospital. One had had a splinter pass right through both his knees, the other has an inch deep incision on his right side, and the third has superficial wounds. The Civil Surgeon, Ratnagiri, who visited the injured men with me, was of opinion that two men were not fit to be removed. I have to report that on receipt of a telegram from Malvan 2 Two Arab Dhows - sailing vessels - under Arab colours, hadtv ZBrjbb N0.579-S of 1942.

Me morandum ♦ sk ' 3 Reference letter Ho.503, dated the 2nd June 1942, from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. There is no objection to your passing on to the Shaikh °f Qatar the information contained in the second enclosure if you^o wish, though I imagine he is in possession of full details already from the crew of the dhow that was sunk. 2. With reference to the first enclosure I do not know what action the Shaikh could usefully take beyond perhaps granting relief to the crew or owner of the dhow and no suggestion should be made to him at present that any action is called for. As you will have seen from my Express Letter No. Sei-sf dated the 16th May 1942, 1 have referred to His Majesty’s Government for instructions on the subject. Xf however the Shaikh of his own accord makes any representation please inform me of the details. sd. W.R.Hay* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
