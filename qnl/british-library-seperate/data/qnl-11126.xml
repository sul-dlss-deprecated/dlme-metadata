The first (folios 125-130) provides an update on the political situation in Persia, and considers how advantageous/disadvantageous it is to British interests, with specific updates on the following places: Isfanhan [Eşfahān], Fars, Bushire, Kerman, Baluchistan, Seistan [Sīstān va Balūchestān], and Meshed [Mashhad]. There is a running — British — concern over the expansion of German influence, and the operation of German supported 'bands' in Persia; a list of causes is provided on folios 129-130.The second section (folios 131-132) provides an update on the North-West Frontier of India, and the third section (folios 133-134) provides an update on Afghanistan. The latter considers the loyalty — to the British — of the Amir of Afghanistan and the influence of a German party in the country. Three copies of telegrams from the Viceroy of India on the subject of the Amir can be found on folio 135.The fourth section (folios 139-140), on the other hand, is a brief update on the situation of the British garrison at Aden, and considers the necessity (for British military interests) in 'separating the Arabs from the Turks'.The conclusion (folios 136-138) provides suggestions as to the measures that may be taken to improve Britain's geopolitical position in Persia, and mitigate future threats to British India.The author is Sir Arthur Hirtzel, Political Department, India Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000137#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
