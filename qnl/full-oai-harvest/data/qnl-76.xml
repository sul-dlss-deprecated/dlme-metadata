These numbers appear in the top right or top left corners of each page.Condition: there is a hole measuring approximately 60x50mm in the top centre of folio 1F, probably caused by the oxidisation of iron gall ink. This hole reappears, diminishing in size, in the following nine folios (to f. 10). The holes have caused loss of text between ff. 1F-9. There is also minor damage to the edges of some folios, but this has not caused any serious loss of text. The entire volume was conserved, probably in the 1980s, in the form of an appliqu√©-coated guard book.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume consists of chronological diary entries containing transcripts of correspondence sent and received, and notes on the arrival and departure of vessels at Bushire.
