ANGUK— A village of 50 houses near Baft {q.v.) in the Kirman province.— Brazier-Greagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.) angGrAn— A village in Bashakard, 904 miles from Jashk, situated at the junction of the Pahtik and Anguran rivers. The chief town of Bashakard and the residence of the Governor is a wretched place consisting of some 55 huts, built of date branches covered with mats, with a population of barely 200 persons. Its chief feature, and the only one which testifies to the former importance of the place, is the fort, which is the principal one in the district and is thus described by Floyer, who visited it in 1876 :— “ The massive but now partly ruined fort of Anguran, which would hold 200 men easily, and 400 in time of war, is perched on the very apex of anarrow tongue of land or cliff, formed by the convergence of two broad and deep torrent beds. These two rivers come from south-south-west and north-north-west, and after confluence go off to join the river Jaghln with a south-easterly course. It is a coincidence that on the prismatic com pass the bearings are 135°, 235°, and 335°. ( t “The hill on which the fort stands is about 360 feet high, and being formed of a conglomerate of clay and shingle, is not quite perpendicular, though only accessible on the south-west side, in which, near the apex, is the only entrance and the only well. The only path up is narrow, tortuous, and very steep and would be rendered very difficult by the destruction of some artmcial steps which now make it practicable. The walls are lofty and very massive. From the base, about 7 feet upward, they are built of large boulders of rounded stones, and above that of a tenacious clay. The citadel and chief’s quarters run across the fort, rather nearer the apex than the centre, and are still in fair repair. Behind this is the mam court, to which no one was allowed access but the soldiers. Ihe walls are pierced for matchlock-men, and a platform for them to stand upon is contnved in the way usual in this country, by a kind of thick inner wall 8 feet lower than the mam wall. Outside the northern wall is a dry fosse, about 25 feet deep and 20 feet broad, cut straight across the penin sula, leaving only a narrow passage between each end of the fosse and the “In both courts, which are overlooked by the chief’s quarters, are the remains of neat rows of mat huts, in which the soldiery lived. fin J hG f n° d ° f tl J e . for 1 t lies a11 around in immense date plantations which till the valley, and m elevated spots, in which are also grown wheat maize pomegranates, etc. The well, which is near the entrance, formerly reached to the bed of the river It was choked up by the besiegers on the capture of the fort, this being about the only effective piece of destruction they ^ )e !'/ ) m trated ’ as c °uld do little harm to the strong walls. The fort is of roughly triangular shape, about 180 yards long by 60 yards broad, across the centre. At the foot of the south-west face are two bui mgs, wmch formerly served as masjids or mosques, and which afford good cover for a small attacking party. Such was the almost impregnable stronghold of the fierce old Saif Allah Khan, which only yielded after a year’s besetment, and it is now so little damaged that should his family and adherents wait patiently and accu mulate wealth by their flocks and agriculture, he will reign again, and from the centre keep the whole country in order. 55 Floyer s anticipation, it may be remarked, regarding Saif Allah Khan again succeeding to power, was not fulfilled. . ■^ 0 European penetrated to Anguran for seventeen years after Floy^r’s journey until, m July 1893, it was again visited by Medley and Massy, the a - V^om b 18 impression of the place as follows :— e fort stands on, and covers, the upper surface of a small spur jutting ou rom the plateau between the Pahtik and Anguran rivers, upon which in more flourishing times stood the large town of Anguran. The pusitiotf was well chosen as entirely commanding the roads in the Pahtik from south B 2ANG—ANJ * fl nd north-west, and practically the north-east approach by the Anguran river Its weak point lay in its north face being level wrth the Anguran plateau and this Saif Allah sought to remedy by digging a most formid able looking ditch some 30 feet deep by 20 broad which is still in good order. The fort consists of three portions, the hill side having been le\ elled 'for the two upper quadrangles, the third being enclosed by a wa simi a in construction to that of the upper portions but not quite so massive. The walls are built of cut stone and boulders to about 6 or 8 feet from the around, and above this of the stiff, tenacious, blue clay, so common everywhere from Jashk to the Band-i-Marz. The quadrangles are each about 50 yards square inside, the two upper enclosures being surrounded by small rooms, which served as store-houses for gram, food, ammuni tion etc., and, as quarters for the garrison. The fort, thoug n ° w m ruins, could be made tenable by a few days’ work. The walls of the lower Quadrangle would have to be blown up and the material made available to strengthening the upper portions, but water would have to be got from the stream below, some 150 yards from the fort as the only well m the fort which was in the middle quadrangle, was filled m and destroyed during the siege which followed the murder of Ghulam ’Abbas. This jell is said to have been excavated originally down to the level of the Pahtik river and its depth was “40 men” or about 220 feet, which very nearly coincides with the height of the middle quadrangle above the river bed and shows the great trouble taken by Saif Allah Khan to make the fort as perfect as possible. On the plateau to the north-east, and close to the fort are the remains of a very fine Shi’ah Mimbar built of well cut stone, and’inside are some beautifully carved Arabic inscriptions on tombstones .of a green marble, which is said to come from Kirman. To the south-west on the river bank is a plain square mosque in which lie the remains of Allah Wordi Khan, assassinated at the instigation of Saif Allah Khan. ( Floyer ; Medley and Massy, 1893.) ANGfeAN (Kiver)— A river in Bashakard which, rising in the hills to the north of the village of Askan, takes a southerly course and eventually joins the Jagin river. It receives the waters of the Pahtik stream at the village of Anguran which stands on a spur between the junction of the two, and from here onward is a river of considerable size, its bed being from 250 to 300 yards wide, and showing signs of carrying a large volume of water in the rainy season Five miles below Angur&amp;n it is joined by the Daruyar (Darusar) river from the north, which is said to rise in the Band-i-Marz. South of Anguran are to be seen signs of old nomad encampments along the river banks, and the remains of brick-built villages—signs of better times .—{Medley and Massy, July 1893.)

The road from Kirman to Khabis crosses this pass which is just passable for camels and barely passable for ridden horses. It has a rise of 2,o00 feet in less than a mile, followed by an equally steep • and stony descent on the other side. Hence all the Kirman-Khabls traffic is carried on by mules and donkeys.— {Newcomen, 1905.) ANJIREH— A halting-place in the Bandan valley on the road between Nasratabad (Sistan) and Birjand.

It consists of 150 houses of rather superior build, surrounding a small fort of the Baluch type. It has a large date grove, neatly arranged gardens, and the ground is well irrigated by * Jcdrlzes. A quarter of a mile to the north beyond the month of the Kunarak Naia is the village of Ahmadabad, and a little further beyond is Khanqan. There are also several smaller settlements up along the Kunarak valley, in the vicinty of hill pasturage, viz., Sardan, Nukband, Asmanabad, Baz- mahi, Tamp, Kandar, Sii’an, Shirini Pathan, Mastmi. These have small patches of cultivation, but no date trees, except at Mastini. Supplies are obtainable in moderate quantities ; fuel and water are abun dant. Between Aptar and Magas there are no supplies. A track runs north from Aptar over the Surkhamba hills to Rindigan and another via Ahmadabad and Khanqan to Damln, Karvanda and Vasht.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) APTHAR— Said to be a halting-place in the Bampur district, 11 miles from Magas on'the road to Khanub. It is situated on a tributary of the Mashkid river; no supplies are available. Probably the same as Aptar (q. v.).—(Brazier Creagh, 1891 ; from native information.) AQTl— A small sub-division of Kirman, the capital of which is Baft (q.v.).

The Arbabls do not inter-marry with other village-dwelling tribes, or with the nomad Baluch. They invariably occupy a subject position, the villages owned and tilled by them being always under the protection of some more warlike tribe. _ , 17 n Pottinger’s description of the Dehwars of Kalat would serve equally well for the Arbabis of Western Baluchistan, and the former are believed to be identical with the Tajiks and Sarts of Afghanistan and Central Asia. However, Pottinger’s description of the Dehwars is not very correct, and there are Tajiks of dissimilar appearance and origin. Some of them are undoubtedly of Moghal descent, others are Iranian, f St. John thinks the Arbabis bear a far stronger likeness to the Turks of Azarbaijan than to any Persian-speaking people of modern Iran.J He also remarks that both Dehwars and Arbabis are found only on the higher plateaux of Baluchistan. _ There is little doubt that Arbabis, Dehwars, and Tapks are all remnants of races older than the Baluchis, Brahuis and Afghans, who are now the principal inhabitants of the countries in which they are found. The Arbabis form the bulk of the village population of Dizak, Jalk, and Kala^han, as well as of Gusht, Paskuh, and Sib. All these districts are under the Dizak chief, who is a Barakzai Afghan by descent, his family having emigrated a good many generations ago from the Helmand. It is not unlikely that they brought the Arbabis with them, and the tribe is perhaps of the same descent as the “ Moghuls ” of Southern Afghanistan. Pottinger also mentions the Arbabis, but contuses them with Naluui Baluch (q.v.) — {St. John.) Regarding Pottinger’s mistake about the Arbabis, see article on Bam- pusht. His description of the Arbabis, whom he describes as “ the fairest tribe of Baluchis he met with, and whose elevation of countenance pre-emi nently distinguished them from among their countrymen,” applies without doubt to the ruling family of the Nahruis who had assumed the title of Arbab. —{Jennings, 1885.)

ASHAR— A village and sub-district of Saravan in Persian Baluchistan. The village is situated on a tributary of the Shahri river, about 15 miles west of Irafshan and 32 miles east of Sarbaz. It consisted (previous to 1902) of a mud fort, commanded from all sides and surrounded by hovels. Water is obtainable from kdAzes, while supplies and camel-grazing are very limited. About 4 miles to the south is the village of Afshan, which also possesses a mud fort. These two villages together contain 160 houses, and, forming a small sub- district, paid a revenue in 1902 of Rs. 1,500. These forts were captured in 1901, and destroyed by the Persians.— (Tighe, 1902; Sykes, 1902.)

ASKAN— A village in Bashakard, situated on the Anguran river, about 4 north-north-east of Angman. It consists of a large date grove and huts scattered along about a mile of the river bank, and has rather cultivation than is seen around the hamlets south of Anguran. 61 X, B, miles a few more C18 ASK—ASP ASKlN— A mountain torrent, rising in the Hindhan range, and forcing its way between the SLiiraband and Rizaband ranges enters the Mashkid stream a little to the south of Kuhak. Perennial water is always to be found in some part of its bed, and it is used to irrigate patches of cultivation on either bank, the cultivators of which are, however, nomads. The Askan cultivation lies between Ghar Gishtar and Mach Nala, on the route from Gwadar to Jalk. St. John describes this cultivation as lying at the mouth of a ravine com ing from the east 2 miles from the foot of the Hinduan Pass. “ A wall of loose stone built across the entrance served as an escarpment to retain a platform of flood-debris and made-soil, perhaps ahenth of an acre in extent. This was planted with a few date palms, beneath which were little patches of several different seeds—cotton, barley, onions, and radishes among the number. Habitation there was none ; the little garden belonging to a tribe of nomad Baluchis encamped further U p the ravine. It appears that these ravine mouths are the only cultivatad spots through a wide extent of coun try from Bampusht to Panjgur in which there are no settled villages. The inhabitants are exclusively Baluchls j owing allegiance to one or other of the powerful chiefs of the neighbourhood, often quite irrespective of the dis trict over which they wander.” On the banks of and in the Askan ravine St. John met with camps of Baluchis belonging to Persian Bampusht, to Kalatl Panjgur, and to independent Kuhak. Jennings was informed that there was a dilapidated fort and some 30 houses, but he did not see them, the owners being Muhammadzais, a branch of the PuskI tribe—headman’s name.

BAFTAN or BAFATAN— A village in Persian Baluchistan, apparently in the Pishin district, which ; is itself a sub-division of Sarbaz. It is situated in the plain on the left bank of the Sarbaz river, about 1 mile south of where that stream emerges from the hills. Pishin is 25 miles east-south-east. Rask village, on the Sarbaz, within the hills, is 5 miles distant; Firuzabad is 10 or 11 miles; Parud is 19 miles. To Qasrqand, westwards along the plain, is about 50 miles. That road has not yet been explored, but the country is open and easy the whole way. Baft an is somewhat to the right of the road from Sarbaz, Parud, etc., to Pishin via Bugani (q.v.). On the opposite side and close to the road are the remains of the old fort and village taken and destroyed by the Persians about 1853. Sir F. Goldsmid’s Mission (1871) heard from a Persian official accompanying them, and who was present on the occasion, that they brought 5,000 men and 10 guns against the place—a statement which Goldsmid characterises as “an unquestionable fiction.” The garrison was only 100 men and the assailants lost 2 killed and 10 wounded in the attack. Haji Abdul Nabi visited Baftan in 1839 and said it was very scantily cultivated. It was then “ under a son of Mi Taj Muhammad',” by whom, he means, perhaps, Mir Jan Muhammad, of Rask. The present Baftan is in a dense grove of date trees. Barley, rice, beans, etc., appear to be procurable in moderate quantities.— (Hdji 'Abdul Nabil Evan-Smith.)

BAHO or BAKU and DASHTIARI— Two districts on the southern borders of Makran, usually coupled together. Their approximate boundaries are as follows:— On the north, the Baga-i-Band range ; on the east, the frontier line between British and Persian Baluchistan, demarcated in 1871. On the south, the sea coast, from a little east of Gwatar Bay to Chahbar. On the west the eastern frontiers of the Geh district, which are not clearly defined. Though these two districts are usually spoken of in conjunction, they appear to be divided into the following sub-districts Sub-district. Mdlidt in 1902. Ra. Gwatar and Bahu Kal3t .. .. .. .. 6,000 Dashtiari .. .. .. .. • • 15,000 In the 18th century Bahu and Da^htiari acknowledged the chief of Sar - baz (q.v.), a district to the north, then one of the petty states of what has been called the Independent Baluch Confederation of Makran. About 1810, however, the local Jadgal Chiefs succeeded in separating themselves from Sarbaz and appear for a considerable time to have maintained com plete independence. For when Goldsmid visited Gwatar early in 1864, he was assured that, until then, never within the memory of man. had Persian claims been urged upon Bahu. Tribute had formerly been paid to 61 I. B. D26 BAH-BAH Kalat through Kej, but since then the State had been independent. In 1868 Ross mentions the Jadgals as acknowledging the chief of Geh, the contiguous district to the west, which at that moment, after many changes and political fluctuations, was held by Mir ’Abdullah Gichki for the Per sian Government. The Persian Boundary Commission of 1871, under Major- General Goldsmid, formally handed over the districts to Persia, by demar cating the frontier line to east of them. It is true they had then been for some time under Persian management, and had been re-united to Sarbaz, being placed under the rule of Hasan Khan Nahrui, chief of that place, to facilitate revenue collections. The greater part of Bahu and Dashtiari consists of fairly fertile and well i watered plains, but little elevated above the sea-level. There are, how ever, various hills and ranges, running generally from east-south-east tb west-north-west. Such are the Pitag Kuh (q.v.), about the centre of the district and the Ripak Kuh, more to the south, on the right bank of the Kaju river. The whole left bank of the Bahu river (q.v.) is also hilly, the country there being covered by the spurs of Jambki Kuh and ranges connected with it. The north-west corner of the district traversed by | Lovett in 1871 is cut up by small ranges, parallel to the Baga-i-Band range. The Bahu river, known in its upper part as the Sarbaz descends through the eastern part of the district, traversing Bahu proper. Below Bahu Kalat {q.v.) it bifurcates, and each branch repeatedly re-dividing itself,makes this tract in ordinary wea^ her nothing but a congeries of stream lets, and in floods a vast sheet of wat r. The district it flows through is called SIsad, or the hundred threads, probably from the multiplication of the water channe’s. Sisad is divided from Dashtiari by one of the prin cipal- treamlets of the Bahu river, at a spot where a sandstone hillock called Char-gul-ki-Dikir indicates the boundary. About here the Bahu receives an affluent, the Kaju, also known as the Dashtiari, which irrigates the Dashtiari district in the same manner as the Bahu does Sisad. The Kaju (q.v.) descends in a souih-eaSterly direction from Qasrqand, and above Dashtiari passes through Kughi. Thus Baku and Sisad may be said to be in the Bahu river, while Kughi and Dashtiari are on the Kaju.* The united rivers then pursue a south-east course to the sea, which they reach in Gwatar Bay, at the port of that name. Dashtiari and Sisad together may be considered the westerly extension of the Dasht plain (q.v.). These last-named districts are, as may be supposed, well-watered. The ! streams are lined with a fringe of Fanesian mimosa, date palms, and tamarisk. On the numerous small streams and channels of the Bahu and Kaju are various villages and hamlets, as well as a few others in the plains. The names of the principal ones are *Bahu Kalat, Miri Bazar, Sisad. Nau, Baji, Behla, Churak, Chakat, Path Kalat, etc. Concerning most of these, some little information will be found under their own names. Bahu Kalat * There is no definite information as to where the Kaju and Bahu rivers join, and the latest maps (1897) are left blank on this point. Dashtiari, or Miri Bazar is about 6 miles west of the present Bahu Channel, and in 1900 Mr. Janes does not mention the Kaju in connection with this place.On page 26, after the first paragraph add : in m“ ,Wing iS a senealo § icaI tree oi the ruI «3 Of Bahu and Dashtlarf Mir Hamal, Burput of Kotri, Sind Usman of Kotri.

It is interesting to note that all the above chiefs are still able to under stand, and some of them to talk, the Sindi language.—• {Gumbley 1913.)D BAH—BAH 27 in 1900 had a population of some 1,200 persons ; Miri Bazar in 187J was estimated at 1,200, but in 1900 it contained only 30 families : official oppression haying driven the others away. Churak in 1871 had 800 souls, but in 1900 it numbered only 55 families, probably for the same reasons. The Dashtiari district from gisad, oh the south-east, to Khan, north of Lhurak, on the north-east, had an estimated population in 1900 of 3 000 Jadgals and about 1,200 Baluchis. The Bahu valley, as a whole, is not very fertile, though a considerable _ c ultivation exists in the immediate vicinity of Bahu Kalat and Mm Bazar. Owing to the fact that Bahu river has changed its course m tire neighbourhood of Sisad (q.v.), land that was formerly highly culti vated has now lapsed into jungle, and official misgovernment is completing the rum. Supplies can generally be obtained, however, at the principal villages. Camels are fairly plentiful, and rice, wheat, millet and barley are raised m the district. The irrigated fields are fenced round with thorn hedges. In the_ cold weather numerous pools are formed by the over- fiow of the Baku, on which wild duck and teal disport themselves, whilst the adjacent copses afford cover to numerous black partridges. On the intervening plains between the streams are found sandgrouse and obara. Away from the rivers, the wide hot plains are irrigated by a system of reservoirs, representing considerable expenditure of time and labour. ; Lovett, in describing Bahu and Dashtiari in 1871, writes ‘With regard to the aspect of these plains, nothing can be prettier than . certain effects the traveller meets with. For instance, just before and I r te , r sun . se -fc 3 under particular conditions of the atmosphere, the landscape is charming. . The hills surrounding the Dashtiari plain have very pro nounced outlines. This, with the softening effect of distance, makes their and sides display various blues and greys, forming a delightful background or the middle distance, composed of date palm and jujube trees, and picturesque Baluch habitations. The wheels for raising water out of the | wells or canals, and the groupings of the inhabitants, variously occupied, as, for instance, women fetching water, have a very good effect. But' ; ll ^ :e man y oriental scenes, a nearer inspection destroys the illusion.” ' i _ The inhabitants of Bahu and Dashtiari are Jadgals, Hots, Lattis, Raisis Lagans, Kosagis, Shahzadehs, etc. The Jadgals {q.v.) are a 8indi tribe' ( undoubtedly of Lumri origin. Originally called in as mercenaries or auxili- , aries they became strong enough to wrest the government from the Bull- ; dis and the Jadgal Chiefs were for long more or less independent, he bhahzadehs are of Arak descent and also migrated from Sind. The Laris are apparently the same as the Lasis, and—like the Jadgals—of Lumri origin ; the remainder are Baluch, the Hots being the most numerous / ^ nd Powerful of all the tribes in Baku Dashtiari. The Singalus, said to e an inferior branch of the Hots, are also largely represented. Lovett thus gives his general impression of the people :— The inhabitants of Dashtiari and Sisad originally came from Sind, and speak a degenerate Sindl, mixed with worse Persian. There are a great mimber of slaves, and traces of African descent are frequently encountered:28 BAH—BAH amongst the population. They live in badly-built mud huts, and are cloth- | ed in garments which are never changed, except when discarded for new ones. The men wear their hair long, and are very proud of their lochs, which they keep constantly moist with rancid butter. The characteristic red skull-cap of the Baluchis was not much worn by the Dashtiaris.” It is evident the above refers mainly to the agricultural population. In all probability the Hots and other Baluch are more or less no madic. Owing to its southern position and low elevation, ranging from 50 to 300 feet above sea-level, the climate of Bahu Dashtiari is very hot in summer— probably hotter than the coast, which, as is well known, is almost unbear able between April and September. In winter, however, the nights are very cold, slight frosts being at times experienced. In December and January the climate is delightful, although the thermometer in the middle of the day rises to 80° and upwards. Gwatar {q.v.) is the natural port of Bahu and Dashtiari, and was noted by MacGregor in 1877 as being, with Pasni, the best place on the Makran coast for landing troops and stores. It has, however, but little trade, and any surplus produce of the district is taken to Gwadar or Chahbar. —{Ross, 1868 ; Lovett, 1871 ; St. John, 1871 ; Janes, 1900 ; Sykes, 1903.) BAHO, or BAHD RIVER—See Sarbaz river and articles above. bahrAmabad— A small village in Makran, 10 miles east of Geh, on the Qasrqand road. Supplies are procurable in moderation, and there is good water from a spring.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893, from native sources.) BAHRAMABAD— A village in Kirman near Shahabad {q.v.). BAHRAM BAND— A village of 3'0 inhabitants, 3 farsakhs north of Bandar Abbas. Water from a well and there is also a spring from which a good supply could be obtained if dug out. BAHRAMjlRD or BAHRAMKARD— Elev. 6,750'. A village in Kirman, 33 miles from the town of that name, on the road to Rabur? It consists of about 100 houses and is situated on the left bank of a stream of the same name. The latter, which is here about 20 yards wide, rises to the west of the Kuh-i-Hazar, and after a short north westerly course loses itself in the sand near Baghin. The road from Rayln to Nagar passes a short distance south of the village. The surrounding district is comparatively rich, and good supplies are procurable. Water is obtained from the river.—(N^es, 1902.) AHRAMKARD —See BahramjIrd.&gt;s r* BAH—BAK 29 &gt; BAHR-ASMAN, KtfH-I— A range of hills in Kirman, situated to the south-east of Rabur.

A town in Makran, situated on the eastern bank of the Bahu river, some 35 miles north of Gwatar. It consists of two mud forts ; and several 'paka built houses, with a population of Baluchis and Jadgals, number ing some 1,200 whose languages are Sindi and Baluchi. There are besides five Hindu traders’ shops in the place. Supplies are abundant, and forage and firewood plentiful. Water is obtained from the river-bed, immediate ly below one of the forts, in unlimited quantities at all seasons of the year. The climate is said to be fairly healthy, and far colder in winter than at Gwadar. The following thermometer readings have been recorded :— 31st January 1872—Minimum 34° ; maximum 80°. May 1900—Noon 98° ; 6 p.m. 89°. For transport purposes camels can be procured from 12 annas to Re. 1 per diem ; and coolies at Rs. 15 per mensem. The river is crossed opposite the village by a ford, which in January 1872 was about 3 feet deep. The bottom is dangerous in places, and ford ing without a guide is unsafe, as the bed is here 60 to 80 yards wide. The actual banks are low, being only 10 feet above the stream, and the water in high floods evidently overflows them. The mdlidt in 1893 was said to be 900 tumdns ; while in 1903, that of Gwatar and Bahu Kalat combined is given as Rs. 6,000. Along the banks of the river, in the neighbourhood of the town, are numerous other hamlets, the whole district being generally celled Kucheh “ the street ” the name applied, in Western Baluchistan, to any river- valley. This district appears to have been annexed by Persia about 1866.— {St. John, 1872 ; Janes, 1900 ■ Sykes, 1903.)

There are the remains of a ruined cistern here, which for a long period has contained no water.— (Khanilco§ ; Mohi-ud-Din.) BALAK or BALAG— Lat. 25° 39'; Long. 59° 22'. A place near the coast of Persian Baluchistan, either included in Bir {q.v.), or forming a small district by itself. Pierce’s Telegraph Route (1883), from Gwadar to Jashk, mentions a spot called Balak, about 6| miles east of the Rapch river, where there is a well which always contains water. Grant (1809) also mentions it as a halting- place, with wells, 17 miles from Karvan {q.v.). 6 Haji ’Abdul NabI (1839) gives Balak, with Karvan and Surag, as divi sions of the Dasht district {see Dasht), each paying a revenue nf 40 Sitarami ducats (Rs. ? 220) to Geh. i ^ 8 a evenue ot It is possible that there is an dhddi or settlement of Balag, like that of Karvan, north of the road near the hills.

There is a very good spring of water there, almost sweet, and four other smaller springs in the neighbour hood. The grazing is excellent both for camels and mules, consisting of beds of reeds, tamarisk kahur, etc. extending for many miles around. At some remote time there was extensive cultivation and there are still many date palms to be seen ; fuel plentiful.—(James, 1909.) BALiOCHAN CHAH— A halting-place in the Bampur district, in Persian Baluchistan. It is in the sand desert south of Bampur proper, about 14 miles from Gazkuk {q.v.), or 27 from Qasimabad, and is generally made the second stage on the road from Bampur to Maskhutan and Fanuch. Isfakeh {q.v.) would appear to be only a short march south, but the road to this place, Geh, and Chahbar, divides at Gazkuk. High sandhills have to be crossed for a good many miles, both before and after Baluchan Chah, in the immediate neighbourhood of which place the ground is harder, and wild vegetation more abundant, but the whole char acter of the country is sterile. Water from wells is somewhat precarious, Sheep may be procured from nomad Lasharis {q.v.), but no other supplies! * and the camel forage is only adapted for animals accustomed to it, not for those from the coast. There are a few stunted trees near the wells which serve to mark the spot, but firewood is scarce.—(GWJswn'd; Floyer.) Floyer invariably speaks of this place as Luchdn Chdh. ’ He knew both Persian and Baluchi well, and is therefore very likely to be correct. BALUCHI (BALUCHAN)— A village in the Jashk district {q.v.). BALUCHIS— The following account of the derivations of the names of some of the large Baluch tribes, residing in Sarhad, Bampur, Bampusht, Talk, etc., was obtained by Captain Jennings from Sardar Fatteh Muhammad of Bam pusht, his brother Yar Muhammad, and by the RikI Sardar Qadir Bakhsh of^ Chagird (a village of Jalk) ; also some details connected with Mir Chahkar. The Baluchis under Firuz Khan originally immigrated to this country from Halab (Aleppo in Syria), seized Minab and Bampur as well as the intermediate country. This was about one thousand three hundred and fifty years ago, when there was a fight between Imam Husain and Yazid, son of Muaviah. With Firuz Khan came nine thousand men, four thousand being Kinds and five thousand Magassis, accompanied by their families. Previous to this invasion of Makran by Baluchis, this part of the country had been in the possession of the Turks ; but in a great battle, the latter being defeated, retreated towards Persia. Firuz Khan reigned for a considerable period, and on his death was succeeded by his son, Shah Hagg.32 JBAL-BAL | The latter during his lifetime abdicated, in favour of his son ! Mir Chahkar, at that time a boy aged seven years. During his reign he was attacked by an army composed of Persians and Turks, and being worsted determined to migrate to Sind and Kachhi. He was accompanied by Sardar Guhram Khan, Rind, and Sardar Bakhar (?) Khan, Magassi, together with the majority of the descendants of the Rinds and Magassis who had come with his grand-father from Syria. Up to this period, it is stated that the word “ Baluch ’ only meant (in Arabic or Turkish?) “ a robber ” or “quarrelsome fellow but that from Mir Chahkar’s departure he and all who accompanied him received the generic name of “ Baluch ” ; but those who remained behind were not, till many years afterwards, considered Baluchis. The following is how the legend goes on :— Amongst the Rinds and Magassis, many were poor, some were afraid, while others preferred deserting Mir Chahkar and remaining in the homes they had established for themselves in their newly-adopted country. Those who remained behind were known from this period onwards as distinct tribes by the following names, which were bestowed upon them by Mir Chahkar : — 1. Rikis—A t this time these people lived on the sandy desert east and north of Jalk and they were called as above, the name being derived from “ Rek, ” a corrup tion of “ Rig,” meaning “ sand ” in Persian. They are now (1885 A.D.) for the most part to be found on the banks of the Hel- mand, in Narmashir, Sarhad, Mashkid, Kharan, Jalk and abound Bampur ; there are also some in Kalat territory. 2. Rakshanis—I n Baluchi “ Rakshan ” (?) means a “ painter ” [a corruption of the Persian word “ naqsheh ” (?), meaning a map]. These, not being men of war, declined to accompany Mir Chahkar, who hence bestowed the name of their calling on them as a tribe. They are now (1885 A.D.) principally met with in Kharan, Dasht, Kolwa, Rak- shanand Sis tan (?). 3. BamarIs—W hen Mir Chahkar was about to start on his expedition, at the time of morning prayer, a section of his people ran away and concealed themselves. On | Mir Chahkar enquiring where they were, he was informed t ,i at when the mulla beat the drum for morning prayer (this mullah is called the “Mu’azzin ; ” the drum is called in Arabic “ zan ” ; in Urdu “ bang ” ; and in Baluchi “ bam ”) these people ran away. Hence as they showed the white feather at the time of “ bam,” they were called Ba- maris. They are mentioned in an old Baluch ballad as follows: “ Kvrd-o-Gubol-o-Bamari Har se ghulame Chakiri.” They are met with in and around Bampur, in Rudbar, and Sarhad ; while the Maris of Kahan, of whom Mir Ullah is Sardar, are said to belong to this section. For a a further account of this tribe, see account of Sarhad. They are now (1909) under S 'iyid Khan, son of Husain Khan, Nahrux. They muster 400 armed men, living in Jahangahi, Karvanda and Kunch. Head man Navab Khan : although Baluch by origin, this tri ;e intermingles with the Persians, and many of them are Shi’ahs. 4. Kalkalis—T his section received their name from the Baluch word “ Kalkuli,'* which means “ boiling. ” When Mir Chankar was starting, these people said their “ deg ” (cooking pots) were not yet ready or “ kalkali,” but that when they were they would follow Mir Chahkar, i.e. as soon as they had partaken of their food. This answer was simply given as an excuse, as they meant to desert him. They reside in the neighbourhood of Bampur, also in Sinukan and neighbourhood. 5. Subhakis—T hese deserted Mir Chahkar in the early morning {subh in Persian and Baluchi); hence their name.4 6 - Kurts or Kurds—I n Baluchi “ Kurt Kanagh,” or “ Kurd Kanagh,” means “ to play the coward ” or “ to show the white feather ” in battle. These npnnlp fled from Mir Chahkar’s standard in the night. * ^ The phrase generally used in Baluchi is “ Baghabitha,” meaning “he showed the white feather ” ; but both are used- These people are found in Makran and Kudbar. 7. Zan-o-Zenis, also called ZAmuDDisis—The origin of the word is “ Zanaph ” the Baluchi for “ to know.” g ’ “ Zan na zane ” in Baluchi means “ Do you know or do you not ? ” They were doubtful at the time of starting, and would not give Mir Chahkar a direct answer to his question as to whether they had made up their minds to start with him or not. They are found around Bampur. 8. Shah Haggis—T hese derived their names from Shah Hagg, the father of Mir Chaahka, whose servants they were. They reside in Sarhad and are few in number As a rule they live with the Bamaris, but are of slave birth (ghulam zadeh) and not of noble birth (asl). ' 9. Nahiiu is—In Baluchi “ Druha ” means “ in good health ; ” and “ Nadruha” means “ ill.” The name is simply a corruption of Nadruha. Regarding the origin of the name, Lockhart, on the authority of Bottinger, states the name probably means low- lander, in contradistinction to the Brahuis or highlanders ; but the derivation of the name is but conjecture. They are found in Sistan Sarhad, Bampur, Chagai, and Mashkid. Head man (1909)—Saiyid Khan The tribe musters 800 nrmedmen living in Rizabad Band and Kasandar. Although Baluch by origin, this tribe intermingles with the Persians, and some of them are Shhahs. 10. Damanis —These were followers of BibI Bamari, Mir Chabkar’s sister. At the time of departure as they were about to accompany him, Bibi Bamari spread out the skirt of her dress (“ daman ” in Persian and Baluchi means “ the skirts of a dress or mantle ”) and craved as a boon that her brother, who had bequeathed to her all the property he left behind, as well as a fort, still known as “ Bibi Bamari’s kaleh ' in the neighbourhood of Bampur, would be pleased to leave this section behind, with her. He consented, and they have ever since been known as Damanis. It may be remarked that it is an old Baluch custom, if a woman wishes to prefer an urgent petition to the sarddr or hakim, she spreads out the skirt of her mantle before him and the request, as a rule, is granted. Frequently an attack by one tribe on another is prevented, or a bloody battle sum marily stopped by mutual consent, owing to the women of both sides spreading out the skirts of their mantles before the would-be combatants. These people are found in Sarhad and near Bampur. A further account of this tribe will be found under Sarhad. 11. PurkIs— The origin of this tribe, who reside in Bampusht only, is unknown. The correct word is “Pirki” from “PIr,” meaning grandfather, and “ kl, ” who, —literally, “ Who is your grandfather ? ” Mir Chahkar, accompanied by all his followers, with their wives, families and cattle, excepting the eleven abovementioned sections, left the neighbourhood of Bampur and invaded Kachhi, which he conquered and repopulated. He is also said to have fought a battle with the king of Delhi, the legend being as follows :— A nephew of Mir Chahkar’s, a son of his sister Bibi Bamari, having quarrelled with his uncle, left the latter and went to Delhi, where, owing to his illustrious descent, also to the fact that he was remarkably handsome and a good swordsman and rider he was well received, and given a post at court befitting his rank and acquirements. This youth possessed a wonderfully beautiful wife, whom he took with him to Delhi The fame of this woman’s beauty reached the ears of the king’s son, who without ever having seen her became enamoured of her, and determined to possess her. In conjunction with the Vazir (prime minister) he contrived that Mir Chahkar’s nephew should be despatched on some important mission from Delhi; and during his absence he caused his lovely wife to be seized and conveyed to his harem. 61 1,B. £u BAL—BAL Mir Chahkar’s nephew having accomplished satisfactorily the objects of his mission was returning, highly elated, with all speed, to Delhi, when he was informed by some fakirs of what had occurred. Higlilyincensed as he was, he feigned acquiescence, but, watching for his opportunity, he succeeded in murdering both the king’s son and his own wife during the night; he then left Delhi and rejoined Mir Chahkar. On the king hearing of the murder of his son, he despatched an army to Kachhi and demanded that Mir CLahkar should send him back one of his nephew’s arms. This demand being refused, a battle ensued, and Mir Chahkar’s army was defeated. A second battle, however, soon followed, in which the army of the king of Delhi was defeated and pursued almost to the walls of Delhi, where a permanent peace was concluded. Some of Mir Chahkar’s army returned to Kachhi, but many remained in the Pun jab, Sind, and other places. 12. TAUQis— The branches of this tribe are:— Isma’Il/ai. Kamarzai. Sanjarani. • Muhammadani. This is a Brahui tribe, and was formerly called Tauqi Brahuis. Traditions differ as regards the derivation of the word “ Tauqi.” One story is : In ancient time the monarch of Khorasan killed the chieftain of this tribe, and his preg- .nant widow came before him and craved mercy for her child about to be born. The monarch put a golden necklace (tanq) round her neck and granted her request. On a son being born to her she called him Tauqi, and his descendants are the present “ Tauqis.” Another story is : The origin of this tribe being unknown, they were called “ Tau- kis,” a corruption of the Baluchi expression “ Tau kaie ” meaning “who are you.” 13. Rinds —A tribe of Makran, who claim to be of Arab origin and to have come ’from Aleppo, but are to all intents and purposes Baluchis. Their head-quarters are in Mand, about eighty miles north of Gwadar and a short distance east of the Persian -frontier, but a few are found scattered throughout the districts of Persian Makran. Their fighting strength is estimated at 1,500 men. The majority of the Rinds ordinar'ly follow ■peaceful pursuits, but the headmen exercise little influence over individuals, and the tribe is consequently prone to misbehaviour and difficult to control. The Rinds hardly fall within the scope of this Gazetteer but for their connection with Gwadar, in the neighbour hood of which they have sometimes given trouble by raiding. In recent years, however, they have conducted themselves peaceably and have taken to cultivation, of which their country, which is open, is not incapable. 14. Dehwdrs. —A tribe of Rind Baluchis. The inhabitants of Bampusht, Kuhak, Isfandak, Dehak, Dizak, Sib, Magas, Bampur, and Jalk are, with a few insignificant ex ceptions, a part of the great horde of Rinds who emigrated through Persia and settled in Dalgan and the surrounding country, and thence spread over into Baluchistan. From here again, a few years afterwards, another part of this horde, under the leader ship of Rustam Khan Chakar, emigrated and settled at the foot of the Kalat plateau on the east, in the Kachhi, and the hilly tracts to the north of it. Some of these migrated back to their former possessions, leaving a number of their tribe in the hills north-east of Kalat, in Shoran. This tribe is called the Dehwar and is to be found in the above- mentioned tract, as also about Dizak and in Suran and Sib : south of the former is Wes tern Baluchistan. Although now considered a subject of Persia, the chief of the whole of the Dehwar clan, Sardar Qadir Bakhsh of Dizak, keeps up his relations with the representative of the Ahmadzais, who once owned the whole of the country inhabit ed by the Balueh tribes even up to Sarhad, and letters are said to pass between Sardar Qadir Bakhsh of Dizak and His Highness Khudad Khan, K.C.S.I., of Kalat, twice or three times during the year. One of his confidential servants stated that his master fully intends, if ever hard pressed by the Persians, to emigrate back to Shoran in Kalat territory, and seek the protection of the Khan of Kalat, Sardar Qadir Bakhsh ia undoubtedly the mostBAL—BAL S5&gt; powerful chief in Western Bealuchistan, as his clan is numerous and he personallv is greatly respected for the rectitude and integrity of his private character hSu ence is said to be always used for good, and at the last pacification of this countrv bo used his interest to restore to Mahmud Khan of Isfandak Shirdil Khan of TCnl - f- and Mahmud Khan of Sib, their villages and property in the country Kala ^ it is also said that the revenue is first collected by Qadir Bakhsh Khan and then made i m J han who m turn, remits it to the Persian Governor in Bampur Qadir Bakhsh is the only chief in this part of the country whom the Persians have not been able to oppress.

(The eastern border has at times been the subject of considerable dispute between the British and Persian Governments, for some particulars of which vide Kuhak and Mirjawa.) The principal harbours along the coast-lme are Gwatar Chahbar and Tiz which are described under their own headings. Besides these there are’several small bays and indentations, which are only used by the fishermen and smugglers. # . Generally speaking, Persian Baluchistan is _ a very mountainous region with ranges rising up to close on 13,000 feet in height. Starting northwards from the coast, for the first 20 or 30 miles, the country is comparatively flat and interspersed with minor hills until the Lashar range is reached, with its eastern continuation of the Bampusht mountains, the average height of their vratersheds being about 5,500 feet. South of this range all the water drains to the sea, through the Nihmg, Sarbaz 'Kaiu, Geh, and Rapch rivers ; while north of it, it is either absorbed in the Jaz Murian Hamun through the Bampur river, or in the Mashkid Hamun through the Mashkid and Talab rivers, none of it reaching the sea. North of the Bampur valley lie the highlands of Sarhad,_ where the ranges have a general northerly and southerly trend, culminating in the Kuh-i- Taftan (12,681 feet) about the centre. To the^ west is the low-lying Kirman desert, and to the east British Baluchistan. With the exception of the rivers mentioned above, there are none of any importance ; no navigation is possible on them, and only after heavy rain do they possess any considerable volume of water. Usually they are ford able almost everywhere, and in the hot weather they nearly dry up, so that the main Mfileh routes run along their course. Properly speaking, there are no lakes in Persian Baluchistan. The northern drainage of the Lashar hills and that of the Bampur river, with its tributaries, runs into the Jaz Murian Hamun, which also receives the Halil Bud and otherminor streams. This hdmun, though of considerable extent during the rainy season, almost dries up during the summer months, all its water being lost by evaporation. To the west of Vasht is another small hdmun of no importance, the Chah-i-Gabi Hamun, which is similarly generally dry. The Mashkid Hamun .in British territory absorbs the Mashkid, Talab, Kalaghan and Jalk rivers. The other numerous watercourses and ndlds with which the country is cover ed seldom have any running water in them, though it can, in most places, be found by digging in their beds, the water level being about 4 feet below the surface. , . , , Persian Baluchistan is divided into four Administration. , . . . v , • , administrative districts— (1) Makran reaching from the sea up to the watershed of the Lashar range, with Bashakard on the west, and Saravan on the east. (2) Bampur, north of the Lashar range, with Sarhad on its north, Saravan on its east, and K rman on its west. .BAL-BAL 37 (3) garavan or Dlzak, with BampQr on its west, Sarhad on its north, and the boundaries between British and Persian territories on its east and south. (4) Sarhad, with Bampur and Saravan on its south, the Kirman desert on its west, and British Baluchistan on its east. The divisions between these districts are ill-defined and shadowy, so that it is quite impossible to lay them down with any degree of accuracy. They are again divided into sub-districts, as shown in the annexed table ; but it must be remembered that the revenues shown against each vary from year to year, and frequently can only be collected by force of arms.BAL-BAL 43 _ The Baluchi language belongs to the Iranian branch of the Aryan family, while the Brahm is alan to Tamil.

Colonel Showem in 1902 gave an estimate of 11,000 fighting men in the four districts. Besides these two authorities there are no data to go on, except that the population chi“mar WaS Ca C ' llated t0 be 8 ’ 0C0 Emilies, say 40,000 people.

The valleys of the Bampur division are stiffing m the summer months, while Bampfir itself is notorious for its unhealthiness. Among the highlands of Sa?had how ever, different conditions prevail, and on the slopes of Kuh-i-Tafta’n are spots which might make good hill stations, but the question of supplies would be a very difficult one. The air is dry and bracing and in the winter snow and ice are not uncommon An fact heavy snowstorms have been recorded at Bampur in February. Among the mountains the four seasons prevail, but towards the south, two only—the cold and the hot.

Landing at Gwadar they marched to Magas, via Turbat, Pishin, Sarblz and Irafshan ; and from thence one party proceeded to Panjgur, one to Mlijawa via Vasht, and a third to Mirjawa via Jalk. They encountered at various times opposition from the outlaws, who mostly defended them selves in their forts ; but it is not thought likely that in future they will trust to them again, when opposed to British troops with guns. In all probability they will wage a guerilla warfare among the hills and defiles, and, unless the further importation of arms and ammunition is sternlv suppressed, they may be a very formidable foe to meet under such condi tions. The transport difficulties of this expedition were considerable. The camels were always breaking down, and constant relays of fresh animals had to be arranged for. It is not possible to give the actual wastage in transport, but it may be mentioned that out of 800 camels about 90 died in less than a month, and 50 per cent, of the remainder were unfit for work. They had to be supplemented by donkeys as far as possible. The wastage of men and the expenditure of ammunition were incon siderable—22 of the former out of some 500, and 2,000 rounds of the latter, during the six months’ operations. Since 1902 the country has been in a state of chaos, and no revenue has been paid to the Persian Government since the time of the Makran expedi tion.50 BAL—BAL The early history Balhctotan is^ shrouded History.

After a few more attempts at independence by the Agha Khan’s party, it remained for Ibrahim Khtn son of a baker at Bam, to achieve the permanent subjugation of Persian Baluchistan, and, though his methods were harsh and cruel, he had suc ceeded, by 1872, in reducing one of the most turbulent countries in Asia to a state of order and tranquility. In 1881 the Brahms of the Afghan Garmsir raided across the But to the gates of Tehran, carrying off a quantity of camels and other property from Taramm : on their return journey they defeated and captured, near fehurgaz, the camp of the Sa’d-ud-Bauleh, who subsequently massacred one of their caravans near Jalk. In 1888 the then Governor Abdul Path Khan conducted a successful campaign against the Yarahmadzai of . garhad, in which the Kurds observed a strict neutrality. As a punishment for this, their women and property were treacherously seized by ’Abdul Path Khan, upon which the Baluchis rose and besieged Pehruj, but they were defeated and the Kurds subsequently all executed, while in 1899 the recalcitrant Baluchi chiefs were seized and imprisoned. In 1896 the Perso-Baluch Commission effected the delimitation of the frontier ; but following on the assassination of the Shah of Persia the Baluchis rose and attacked the Governor-General near Sib, and were defeated In 1897 again there was a rising, and Fehruj desultorily besieged, but nothing resulted. At the end of 1897 Mr. Graves of the Indo-European Telegraphs was murdered on the Rapch river, as a consequence of which the Karvan expedition was organized against the malcontents, but since the spring of 1898 the province has been pacified and no events of any great import ance have taken place. In 1902, however, owing to the lawlessness of the border tribes and their constant incursions into British territory, a small force under Major Tighe, as escort to the Political Officer, Major Showers, marched through Makran and Sarhad; and, in conjunction with Persian troops, captured and destroyed among others the forts of Magas, Irafshan, Afshar, and Ashan, and drove the principal outlaws from the country. About the same time a dispute arose between the Persian and British Governments with regard to the ownership of Mlrjawa {q.v.), but it was settled amicably in 1905, and the border from there to Kuh-i-Malik Siah left undisturbed. {Jennings, 1885 ; Rittich, 19:0; Holdich, 1901 ; Sykes, 19.2 ; Showers, 1902 ; Tighe, 19C2; Hogg, 1909.)

A town in the Bam district of Kirman, about 120 miles south-east of Kirman and 180 miles north-east of Bandar Abbas. It is situated about 8 miles from the edge of the But, and is the chief town of the large and fertile district of Bam-Nai mashir. The city of Bam was founded by Bahman, and situated as it is on the frontier of Persia proper, has always been a place oi much importance. It consists of the old and the new town, the former crowded within the wall that surrounds the fort, the latter scattered along both banks of the river, and liable probably to damage from floods in years of heavy snow-fall. Possessing a fertile soil and a climate suitable equally for palm trees and for many upland products, Bam is the centre of a wealthy district and con tains some 13,000 inhabitants and 3,000 houses. There are many gardens Pomegranates are largely grown. The waieris good from Karizes. A cool north wind mitigates the summer heat, the mountain villages of the Jabal Bariz range are close at hand, and the importance of the place is enhanced by its being the last commercial town of note m this part of Asia until Quetta * is reached. &lt; Caravan rowfes—Bam is served by three main caravan tracks : One runs from Bandar Abbas via Jiruft—a good road, but troubled at times, mostly in the spring, by Bashakardi nomads. Caravans using this road take from 15 to 20 days for the journey, the cost of carriage ranging from 7 to 12 tumdns per Idiarwdr oi 100 maunds Tabriz (6^ lbs.). The other two roads run from Kirman to Bam, one via Nabid, the other via Rayin. These roads bifurcate a day’s march out of Kirman at Mahun, and re-unite a day’s march out of Bam, at Darzin. The telegraph has been laid along . the Nabid road, which is the shorter by some 15 miles, and it is used by the post and the majority of JcdfileJis. The road is quite a good one for Persia. There are some wide rivers to cross, which would be very awkward in time of flood, and in places water is scarce, at others salt, but there are no narrow defiles or high passes. Robberies sometimes take place. The cost of carriage between Kirman and Bam, about 120 miles, vanes from 3 to 5 tumdns, and caravans take from 7 to 8 days to do the journey. . There are other tracks connecting Bam and various villages in the hills and desert, but they are not much used. * The distance is somewhat less than 7o0 miles.BAM—BAM 53 The great caravan track from Herat, Khorasanand Sistan to Bandar Abbas passes within 3 days’ march to the eastward of Bam This bifurcates near Mil-i-Farhad to the south of Ri g a n the w ' + T i At7 ng t T h , rough t , the Radbar district, and thence vid Miiab, to Bandt; Abbas. The other branch lies north and west of this, going bv way of a pass, termed the Nawargu, and across the district of Rudi Th choice of tracks is determined partly by the water-supplies, and partly by the likelihood of meeting brigands. There are also alternative routes from Bam across the Lut, viz., that via Fehruj to Gurg and that vid Rigan to There are two telegraph houses, one English, and one Persian BAM— A region in south-east Persia, forming part of the administrative district of Bam-Narmashir (q.v.).

But the principal wealth of Bam consists m henna, and from here practically the whole of Persia is sun- plied with this commodity. The dried leaves and stems of the plant are brought in from the villages in bundles, and sent to Yaal to be ground (For further information regarding exports and imports, see Bam-Narmashir ) The great mud fort of Bam is celebrated in the history of the province Sykes thus describes itWe visited the famous fort by special invita tion, and found that the old town was still standing, the whole beinv surrounded by a high wall and ditch. We passed through the deserted bazaars for some 600 yards, the fort occupying the northern end of ihe enclosure, and, ascending a steep‘incline in the rock, which has never been smoothed, we passed through a strong gateway and a 40-foot wall which is built of sun-dried bricks, as indeed is the whole fortress. “ We then found ourselves facing a second and equally high wall so™ 20 yards up the hillside, and, turning sharply to the left, approached the second gateway, a square surrounded by stables being below us as we moved along. “ A second equally steep incline, leading up to a similar gateway, brought us to the artillery park, where we saw some muzzle-loading field-guns* M BAM—BAM / mounted on unserviceable carriages ; the date of one, I remember, was A IL 1254 (1838). A third and steeper passage led up from this square to a plat form on which is a well, which we calculated to be some 180 feet deep ; it is alleged to have been dug by Rustam, under orders of King Solomon! It now only supplies the water for a bath. A short flight of steps, and we reached the summit of a fort, a CheUr Fasl or Four Seasons, evidently constituting the Governor’s quarters. From the roof of this building we enjoyed a wonderfully beautiful view. Looking back, Kuh-i-Hazar with its mantle of freshly fallen snow rivetted our gaze, and on each side of the valley, the hills showed up against the turquoise sky, the Shah Savaran range form ing another vision of beauty. Below us lay the date-groves of Bam, and we could trace its river to the north-east; we also indistinctly saw the greenery of Narmashir. Far away, Bazman, loveliest of peaks, rose grandly in solitary state, and we could not decide which was the finer of the two great giants. Bazman, however, rears its head some 9,000 feet above the plain, whereas Hazar, albeit loftier, rises but 7,000 feet above Rayin, and is surrounded by other, if lesser, peaks” Bam and Narmashir between them maintain a regiment of infantry, half of which garrisons Baluchistan, while 100 men are supposed to occupy Bam fort, but these latter were conspicuous by their absence when New comen visited the place in 1905. In modern times Bam was the scepe of the tragedy which culminated the Kajar-Zand struggle, when Lutf’Ali Khan, who had fled from Kirman, was basely surrendered to his hereditary foe by its Governor, to whose hospitality he had entrusted himself. Yet once again in the middle of the nineteenth century, Bam was besieged by a mixed force of Afghans and Slstanis. When the ammunition was all expended and no hope remained, the women of Bam, headed by Banu Husain Fatheh, heated cauldrons of water, and gave the assailants such a warm reception that the city held out until help came from Kirman. A few years later Agha Khan seized the fort and was blockaded therein for the best part of a year, until sickness broke out and he was forced to retreat to India. After this, the erection of the modern town was com menced. In the town several wealthy families reside, chief of whom is the Shaukat-ul-Mamalik, son of Sulaiman Khan, who thirty years ago &lt; was in charge of Sir Frederick Goldsmid s escort. Next in importance, and related to him, is the As’ad-ud-Dauleh, son of the late As’ad-ud-Dauleh, who governed Baluchistan intermittently for many years. — {Sykes, 1902 ; Dobbs, 1992 ; Newcomen, 1965. ) BAMARIS— The name of a Baluch tribe inhabiting Sarhad {see article on latter). BAM BALA, see Bampur. BAM-NARMASHlR— A district of Kirman situated in the south-east corner of the province. It is, as its name implies, really composed of two districts, viz., Bam and Narmashir, but both are under one ruler and are usually included together.' (VV) BAM—BAM 55 Bam-Narmaslilr is about 100 miles in length and varies from 35 to 85 miles in breadth. It is bounded on the north and east by the desert of the Lilt. To the south-east is Bampur ; to the south the Kuh-i-Shah- Savaran. a continuation of the Jabal Bariz range, separates it from Rudbar while on the west lie Sarduleh and Rayin. There is a considerable difference between the elevations of Bam andNar- mashlr, the former being about 3.500 feet above sea-level, while the latter slopes gradually from about 2,700 feet at its northern extremity to about 2,200 feet south of Rigan. There is a corresponding difference in tempera ture, Narmashlr being on the whole much warmer than Bam. The popula tion is about 50,000, and the revenue 13,000 tumdns. The district has from early times been of note in Persia and was desig nated 'Arid, or Four, from its four cities of Bam, Rigan, Narmashir, and Nisa. Of these Bam and Rigan were founded by Bahman, while Ardeshir built Narmashlr, and his wife constructed the dam on which Nisa depended. The ancient dam has long since disappeared, but the present one, com posed of stones and branches of tamarisk, diverts part of the river which flows down the Narmashir valley from its natural course towards the ancient city of Nisa. The stream is at present diverted in three places by temporary dams at intervals of 15 or 16 mifes, and the water conveyed where wanted by cuts leading from the dams, but no attempt has been made to con serve the excess of w^ater in tanks and reservoirs, to the construction of which the surrounding country is peculiarly adapted, and by means of which (in the opinion of Newcomen, who wisted the place in 1905) a supply of water could be secured, amply sufficient for the requirements of the whole valley. The country, owing to its proximity to the frontier, has always been subject to attack by the Afghans and Baluchis, of whom the former were not finally expelled until well on in the nineteenth century, and this has con siderably retarded prosperity. With an improved administration and increased and better irrigation, the district, already one of the most flourish ing in Persia, would be capable of immense development. Agriculture .—The lands in Bam-Narmashir are mostly in the hands of a few Khans, who have very extensive holdings which they look after themselves, the villagers being for the most part their labourers. There are, however, certain government or JcJtalsa lands, mostly used for rice growing, and a small amount of ra'iatvari. The region is well watered, drawing its supplies both from open irrigation channels and from qandts. In dry years the streams often fail, but the qandt supplies may be depended on so long as the tunnels are kept clean. Agricultural implements are primitive. A very light and weak plough, something like that used in the Kumaon Himalayas, and a very long handled , narrow spade, are those chiefly used. These are supplemented by a wooden harrow and an instrument for loosening the spade-worked soil, somewhat resembling a dining fork and also made of wood. Some very striking earth formations are noticeable in Narmashir, which at first sight have the appearance of a city in ruins with walls, gates, and bastions, but which on cipher inspection turn out to be masses of kankar and sand, worn into the fantastic shapes by the action of water. Game is abundant—wild fowl, black partridge, and wild pig especially being found in large numbers.56 BAM—BAM Exports and imports.—The following are the products and the principal imports of the district :— Cotton, raw, sown March—April, picked October—November. Crop 100,000 mans (Tab.), yielding 30,000 mans cleaned cotton. Price on the spot 37 to 38 turndns per kharwdr cleaned. This has so far been all used at home, but in 1904 a trial shipment of 3,000 mans was sent to Bombay. Cotton, manufactured. —A coarse cloth called ‘ Grarah is manufactured and sold at * krdn a yard. Some 800,000 yards of this are produced a year, about 3,000 women being employed for six months in spinning and weaving. . Wool, raw. —About 10,000 mans (Tab.), half of which is tine wool or kurk, are produced m the Bam district yearly and handled by the merchants* who 5 buy in small quantities from the herdsmen and farmers; some lots of the best are, however, sent in by Khans from their estates. This wool is all exported to Kirman, Yazd, Kum, and Isfahan, where it realizes from 8 to 14 a man for fine, and from 4 to 8 for coarse wool. The wool is nearly all used in the manufacture of carpets, and none is exported to India. The quality is said to be very good. Henna—This is the chief product of the district, which produces some 500.000 mans annually ; about f of this goes to Yazd and Kirman, where it is ground at the rate of 1 ^ krans per man and distributed to the chief towns m Persia. The remaining } is treated locally, part being usedlocally and part finding its way into Baluchistan and Afghanistan. Price on spot, unground,. 2 to 2£ krdns per man. Ditto, ground, 3 to 3-| krdns ditto. Indigo. The plant grown here is smaller and has finer leaves than the varieties grown in Behar and the United Provinces. It is locally known by the name “Parang. ” It is practically never treated for the extraction of the dye, but is ground in the same manner as henna and is mixed with it to form a paste for the dyeing of beards and hair, where black is preferred to red. Thirty thousand mans of leaf are produced, and nearly all is sent to Yazd and Kirman. Price on spot 1£ to 3 krdns per man. Lentils (moong). —Annual production 30,000 mans; 20,000 mans sent to Kirman and Baluchistan. Two tumdns per kharwdr. Barley and oate.—Production of both 3,000,000 mans, of which about 50,000 mans go to Bandar Abbas ; 600,000 to Kirman and other places. Price barley 4 tumdns per kharwdr ; oats 2 tumdns per kharwdr. Hates. Fifty thousand mans a year. About 3,000 mans of the best go to Kirman, spot price 1 krdn for from to 2 mans. The people live largely on dates, and the local production is supplemented by about 15,000 mans brought in from Baluchistan. Hice. —Forty thousand mans produced; 10,000 mans go to Kirman.

The plant producing it grows wild over all the hills and is in appearance like furze. In 1905 arrangements were being made to collect it.H 2 (4) A road from Gwadar vid Pishin and Sarbaz. This is a better road than that via Qasrqand, but perhaps not so good on the whole as that through Geh, while it is longer. At Sarbaz it divides. The most direct track is via Ispatki but it is difficult for heavily-laden camels. The roads join’again at Kahiri. 6 (5) From Chahbar by Qasrqand—a fair track fit for laden camels. The road from Kech and the interior of Makran joins the above at Pishin. The northward roads are - (1) North-west to Bam, and thence via Khabis (east of Kirman) to Khorasan, or north-east to Sistan by the route followed by Goldsmid’s Mission in 1871. ^ (2) Jennings’ route through Sarhad to Sistan vid Karvanda. There are three roads to Bam, the most southerly was followed by the Sistan Mission, the middle one by Jennings and Sykes, and the northerly one by Pottinger. Bampur is no longer the head-quarters of the district, since Pahfira rose to importance. The Governor and most of the troops are now quartered at the latter place, while in the former remains only a nominal garrison of 500 men. The elevation of Bamptir may be taken as ranging between 1,500 and 2,000 feet, with a general average of about 1,900 feet ; that is 2,500 feet lower than the Magas valley, on the other side of the Ispidan Kuh, and 1,000 feet less than Bam-Narmashir. A large portion of the plain appears to be sand desert.* Heavy rolling gand ridges cover the south-eastern part of it extending up to the foot slopes of the hills. They lie at about right angles to the river and are about 20 feet high, and covered with tagaz and green vegetation. St. John describes these ridges as having been heaped up by the wind and attain ing occasionally to a height of 40 feet, the crests of these veritable billows varying in distance apart from 100 to 300 feet. * Goldsmid, who had had some experience, does not consider this a true desert. He Says the sandhills are few and far between, and never succeed each other with the regularity of ocean waves, as between Hohri and Jesalmir. Moyer, however travelling the same road to Bampur ten years later, at 15 miles from Maskhutan entered a sea of enormous hills of loose sands. Six miles further on he got “a view of the open country, all sandhills.”' However, Moyer does not consider the high sandhills stretch far to the west of the Maskhutan-Bampu r road. Where they cease, the so-called desert ie probably a sandy plain with alluvial soil and gravel intermixed. It would be interest ing to learn how far this sandy desert stretches, probably not so far as St. John’s map would lead one to imagine. According to Floyer above quoted, the heavy sand ceases at about 38 miles from Qasimabad on the Fanuch road. From thence to Maskhutan (62 miles), both Goldsraid and Floyer agree that there is but little sand. From Maskhutan to the hills, which are entered at 14 miles (76 from Bampur), the plain is mostly of hard gravel and stony. On the road to Chahbar, through Lashar and Geh, the desert is of the same nature, but is crossed nearly at right angles. According to Grant, the heavy sand would’ appear to cease at 12 miles before reaching Isfakeh, that is, at about 23 miles from the river, and this may be taken as about the breadth of the real desert. For Beresford- Lovett’s description of the sand desert, east of the above road, along the foot of the hills, see article Surmich.BAM—BAM 61 The following villages, amongst others, are included in the Bampur District:— Pahraj .. .. ..

The people of Bampnr are of a mixed race, very inferior to the ordi nary Baluch, and showing strong traces of negro blood. Both Gold- smid and Gasteiger describe them as having very dark skins, curly hair, and the negro type of feature. The males are half-naked; the women and children dirty, dishevelled and ugly. They are rude and uncivilized in their habits. Their language appears to be Makrani Baluoh, with a larger mix ture than usual of Persian. Floyer remarks that Persian is more spoken than Baluchi. The people live in rice straw huts, mostly along the river. There are about 200 huts on the north bank, where the road to Fanuch, etc., crosses the stream—a location probably preferable to that of the town near the fort. These people are practically slaves. The land belonging to Govern ment, they obtain but a bare subsistence in return for their toil, and a state of degradation is the natural consequence. Gasteiger says they are cap able of improvement, but their wretched condition cannot be bettered without a change in the system of administration. The people of Fehruj and Aptar—free Baluch peasants, tilling their own land—are much superior to the cultivators of Bampur proper.i62 BAM—BAM The tribes are divided into dwellers on the right and left banks of the Bampur river Nahrui ,. .« . &lt; «.

The climate of Bampur is notoriously bad and a bye-Word for unhealthi ness even in Baluchistan. The highly irrigated Climate. land along the river, and the burning sandy desert beyond it, give rise to sudden changes of temperature and altera tions from intense dryness to complete saturation which are most prejudi cial to health. During the five nights St. John remained at Bampur (April 2nd to 6th, 1872) the minimum of the thermometer was as follows :—58°, 50°, 80°, 62°, 48°. The cold weather may be considered tolerably pleasant, though a considerable degree of heat may alternate with cold, surprisingly sharp, considering the comparatively low eleva tion (1,800 feet). Floyer in 1876 experienced severe cold, and on the 31st January was overtaken by a heavy snowstorm 5 miles south of Maskhutan (Maskotu), on the southern edge of the desert. The cold was intense, although the elevation of his camp could not have been greater than that of Bampur, and it was half a degree further south. It begins to get warm in February. Gasteiger noticedfthat bean crops were ripe on the 20th February 1881, but it might have been an unusually early season. In March the climate usually becomes hot, and unhealthy at the same time. The whole of the hot weather is very unhealthy and un pleasant. Other recorded readings of temperature are as follows :— 20th November 1893—2 p.m. 87° F. 28th May 1900— 6 a.m. 24° C.; noon 42° 0. 25th July, 1906—2 p. m., 116° F. 26th „ „ —2 p.m., 112° F. The history of Bampur resembles in its general outline that of the rest j,. of Persian Baluchistan. From the earliest 3 or ^' times it has been the scene of war and rapine, sometimes owing allegiance to one chief, sometimes to another, inter spersed with periods of independence. In 1810 it was ruled by Shah Mihrab Khan, one of the then most powerful chiefs in Baluchistan, who was famous as a raider of his neighbours’ territory. In 1844 it was Seized by Sardar Khan, one of the followers of Agha Khan, head of theBAM—BAM 63 Khoja sect, and at one time Viceroy of Kirman. The Persians accord ingly moved against the fort and captured it in 1845, from which time it has remained in their possession, the district being finally brought into subjection by the celebrated Governor Ibrahim Khan, who died in 1884. Since then, with the exception of a few minor risings and rebellions, the province has remained quiet and peaceful.— {Vide article on History of Baluchistan.)—; St. John', Floyer ) Jennings, 1885 \ Brazier- Creagh, 1893 ; Sykes, 1893 — 02.) BAMPUR KULMA, see Bampur. BAMPUSHT— Elev. about 3,000'. This district is situated to the north of the Kuh-i-Zamiran and to the west of the Sagarkand. Its northern boundary is the Mashkld river flowing from Sarhad via Dizak and Isfandak to the desert ; and its western boundary is the Chidigan Kaur. To the east lies the district of Panjgur. In former days the district was governed by a race of chieftains who styled themselves Buzurgzadehs [not in any way connected with the Buzurgzadehs (Kurishi Saiyids), to which family Sardar Dilavar Khan of Dizak belongs]. These Buzurgzadehs are true Saiyids, and the ruling chief for the time being took the title of “Malik.” At one period they likewise govern ed Bampur, {See History of that place.) Pottinger in 1810 states as follows regarding this family :— “ The original masters of these villages, etc., were Malikuh Baluchis, who have been nearly exterminated during their struggles with the Arbabis.” But he has made a curious mistake in calling them “ Malikuh Baluchis.” “Malik” is simply a title meaning “prince” or “lord,” which the Buzurgzadeh Saiyid rulers had assumed. Pottinger likewise makes the mistake of confusing the Arbabis {q.v.) with the title of “Arbab” (plural of the Arabic word “Rabb,” meaning “lord ”), the title assumed by the ruling chief of the Nahruis at or about the time the Buzurgzadeh rulers assumed the title of “ Malik.” After a period a family of Chakri Rinds, from Kolwa, near Panjgur, succeeded these Saiyids in the chieftainship of Bampusht. The first Sardar of this family who became ruler of Bampusht was named Mir Ahmad. This was during Nadir Shah’s reign, and when Ni’matulla I ruled at Dizak, and Mir ’Abdulla I at Jalk. {See account of latter,) From the period when the Chakri Rinds succeeded the Saiyids as chief tains of Bampusht, the latter has been considered, as it is now, a sub-dis trict of Dizak ; but in those days the whole district merely paid a nominal annual revenue of one camel, which was sent to the Hakim of Dizak as a “ nazr.” The present Sardar is Sahib Khan, who succeeded in 1892. The yearly revenue of Bampusht is about Rs. 600. This amount is collected by the Sardar and paid into the Dizak treasury; whence it is remitted to Bampur,64 BAM-BAM The following villages are included in this district:— Murtl. Gorai. Gizan* Bat.

The latter call themselves Ba chis, but are really of the Purki tribe— origin unknown. See account of that tribe given in the article on Balu- phig. [Details from Sarddr Fateh Muhammad, and his brother Ydr Muhammad.) BAMPUSHT KtFH— A considerable range of hills in Persian Baluchistan, either within., or forming the southern boundary of, the district of the same name. [See above.) These hills, running east and west, are a continuation of the range which bounds Rakhshan and Panjgur [q.v.) on the south. They are united to the latter (eastwards) by the Mazampusht Kuh, Sagarkand and Pim- piska [q.v.), all part of the same hills. To the west the range (no doubt here called by a different name) bends north-west, following the general run of the ranges in this part of the country, and appears to join the ele vated mass of the Isfidan Kuh, Humand, etc. The Bampusht range is of some importance in the general topography of the country, as from the Mazampusht Kuh westwards its crest is the water-shed between the basins of the Mashkid and the Nihing. It is also considered to form the boundary between Makran, in its geographical sense, and Dizak. It seems strange it should not have been made the poli tical boundary also in place of the Nihing, more especially as water-sheds are commonly used as lines of demarcation in this country, and streams, along which people live, very rarely. As the boundary laid down by Golds mid’s Commission of 1871 now stands, the district of Bampusht, instead of being bounded on the south by the line of the Bampusht Kuh, appears to come down to the Nihing stream, which is here supposed to divide Kalat from Persian territory. The Bampusht Kuh is of considerable elevation. Its summit line is seldom less than 5,000 feet above sea level, and about 2,000 feet above the councry at its base. Some peaks rise to 7,000 feet.* Beyond Pimpiska^ * So Lovett says in his original report, but in his contribution to Eastern Persia ha pays the hills are only 5,000 feet high.65 BAM—BAN f however, the hills become thin and broken, and though easily traced, the range appears to be insignificant until the Kashani Kuh, south of Panjgiir, is reached. However, the Barapusht Kuh and Mazanipusht and Sagar- kand is a lofty and somewhat imposing-looking range, though devoid of vegetation or natural beauty. Looking from the Nihing, St. John remarks :—“ To the north an arid brown plain stretched away to the Bam- pusht hills, rising like a wall in naked ugliness some 10 miles oft.” On the other side also the Bampusht Kuh appears to be more or less precipitous. It must not be supposed, however, that the hills consist of. one single bold range. As is almost always the case in this country, the range is composed of several parallel ridges, among which one perhaps dominates the others sufficiently to be considered the main range. Lesser parallel ranges also occupy a portion of the Bampusht district. So far as we are aware, the Bampusht hills can only be crossed by one pass—the Hinduan—which leads over the eastern end of the range. (It will be found described under its own name.) But it should not, therefore, be supposed that no other roads exist. In all probability there is more than one pass leading from the unexplored district of Irafshan on the south to the equally unexplored Bampusht, etc., on the north. In fact the direct road to Dizak by which St. John and Blanford sent_back their Indian servants, superfluous tents, etc., in 1871, lies through Irafshan, and must therefore cross the westerly prolongation of the Bampusht Kuh. The geological formation of the Bampusht hills is of tertiary age and belongs to the nummulitie series, Blanford remarks :—“ The rocks of the Bampusht range are shales and sandstones, precisely similar to the other nummulitics previously traversed.” See also article in Baluch istan Gazetteer, Makean—Geology.— (XoveW ; St. John-, Blandford.)

A walled village situated at the mouth of a defile in southern Khorasan, in the Nehbandan buluk of the Kain district. The defile at Bandan is only about a quarter of a mile wide, with hills rising up sheer on either side 61 I. B. 1I ■4* 68 BAN—BAN and the Bandan river flowing down it, about 50 yards to the east of the village. There is little or no water in the river, except during or after rain, when it comes down in a torrent. There are 50 houses inside the walls of the village and a large date grove in the valley above the village, containing about 6,000 trees, each tree yielding about 31bs of dates in an ordinary year; ropes are made out of the fibre of the palm. The principal importance of Bandan from a military point of view lies in the fact that it is situated at the mouth of a pass debouching on Sis tan and on the road between it and Neh, Birjand and Meshed. It is also the last point at which water for anything but a very small body of men and animals can be obtained en route to Sistan, until the Hdmun is reached, 30 miles distant. Bandan produces about 10 to 20 khanvdrs or 150 to 300 Indian maunds of wheat and barley, but it does not suffice for the wants of the people who obtain supplies from Sistan.

Bandar ’Abbas, formerly called ' Gombroon ”, became important after Shah ’Abbas I had expelled the Portuguese from Hormuz Island in 1622; British and Dutch factories were then established there. The former was re moved to Bushire in 1775. In 1856 Bandar ’Abbas, which, with the Islands of Qishm and Hormuz, had been held in farm by the rulers of ’Oman, was formally declared to belong to Persia, and placed under the Governor of Shiraz. In A gust 1911, a raid by Baharlu tribesmen from Pars caused fears of an attack on the town and the consular guard was temporarily increased. This threat of attack brought a party 80-100 of tufangchis from Bushire” in the “ Persepolis ”, for the protection of Bandar ’Abbas, and these men each brought 2 or 3 rifles, which they disposed of in the town, in spite of protests. Otherwise, during 1911, the arms traffic, which had in the previous few years assumed large proportions, subsided somewhat in the neighbourhood of Bandar ’Abbas. In 1912and again in 1913 (March), a raid by Baharlu tribesmen occurred which frightened the inhabitants of Bandar ’Abbas, and necessitated the landing of a small naval contingent. Description. Site and buildings .—Bandar ’Abbas stands at the foot of a bay upon a ! low, sandy, shelving beach ; the buildings approach within 100 yards of the water’s edge. The town looks out between the islands of Hormuz and Larak upon the junction of the Gulfs of Persia and ’Oman off the Ras-al-Jibal pro montory : its background, as viewed from the sea, is formed by the massive pile of Kuh-i-Ginau, which at a distance of only 18 miles north by west of the town attains an altitude of 7,783 feet. The immediate surroundings of Bandar ’Abbas are utterly bare ; even the usual drapery of a few palms and garden cultivation are here wanting. C26GSBThe town is about a mile long, and half a mile deep. It fronts on the beach. The bulk of the town is composed of houses of sun-dried brick. A number of the houses possess bldglrs which here take the form of low square towers like those of English country churches, but more squat, and with vertical slits upon all four sides towards the top. The town was formerly enclosed by walls upon the landward side ; but these, where they still exist, are concealed by the quarters which have sprung up out side them. At the head of the pier stands the old Dutch factory, used as a residence by the Deputy Governor, and the Customs house. The ground around the town and the British Consulate is sandy desert, and quite open. The ground rises gradually from the beach to some low hills at a distance of a mile or a mile and-a-half. A river-bed, dry in Jan uary 1910, is on the east of the town, and divides the town from the sandy desert on which stands the British Consulate. The caravanserai is about 20 feet above the river bed, and 150 west of it, on the eastern outskirts of the town. Climate .—The climate of Bandar ’Abbas is notorious for its heat and un healthiness ; but there is no meteorological station and precise data are not available. The summer heat is very unpleasant; this is due doubtless to the combination of the moist air from the stagnant bay in front of the town, with the reflected and radiated heat from the mountain wall behind. The actual temperature, however, is not very high—normally 96° 102° F. during June, July, and August—rand the nights are almost invariably cool. Even in the depths of winter the mercury seldom falls below the freezing point, and when, on the morning of the 29th of January 1905, pools were found covered with a thin coating of ice, the oldest inhabitants professed themselves unable to recall any similar occurrence. The months of January and February are cool and salubrious with occasional showers of rain which are some times heavy ; in March, April and May the temperature rises, the surrounding country becomes dried up and malaria prevails ; in June, July, August and September the heat is intense, and most of the inhabitants desert the town to escape it, but at the same time fever diminishes ; during Octo ber, November and December the heat is again upon the wane and malarial fevers are once more rife. Mosquitoes are troublesome in the spring and autumn months. The rainfall is confined to the 4 months — November 20th to March 20th,—during which time, an average of about 6 inches falls. Normally, rain may be expected on about 3 days in November, 6 each in December January and February and 4 in March. For winds see under Harbour. Health. There are no sanitary arrangements ; the foreshore serving as latrine. There is no scavenger class among the inhabitants. Fever is pre valent especially during November, December, March and April Guinea-worm is bad during May, June, July. Europeans find quinine and spirits necessary as preventatives against fever and the enervating climate. Great care is necessary in the sterilisation of all water for drinking or cooking purposes, otherwise guinea-worm is an almost certain result' there was no plague at Bandar ’Abbas in 1911, although it appeared at most other ports in the Gulf, nor was there any other epidemic.3 P0PULx\TI0N. Bandar Abbas in 1908 consisted of over 2,000 houses and huts, the more substantial structures outnumbering the slighter in the proportion of 3 to 2 Ihe cold-weather population is about 10,000 souls ; the summer popu- ation is very much less. The bulk of the inhabitants belong to a hybrid race of rmxed Persian, Baluch, Arab, and Negro descent and are known as Dbasi.. Ihe Abbasis are a poor-spirited race and hardly, it is said regard truth, honesty, or charity as virtues. The poorer classes lead a mean and squalid life m date-leaf huts. A cheap diet of fish and dates comprehends all their desires, and when this is already provided laziness and independence alike forbid them to work. This apathetic spirit among the labouring classes impedes all work and goes far to justify the local saying that nothing begun at Bandar ’Abbas is ever finished. Apart from the merchants and shopkeepers, who are mostly strangers from abroad the people are all boatmen, fishermen, or labourers, and in the date season all are converted into harvesters. The immigrants upon whom the life of the place chiefly depends are Persians from Bar (500 souls), from Ahwaz (300 souls) and from Bastak (150 souls) ; also Hindus (66 souls), Khojas (67 souls) and Arabs (50 souls), bunms at Bandar Abbas are about half as numerous again as Shiahs, and belong mostly to the Shafi’i school, but some are Hanafls. Language.-—Pmz Persian is generally understood, but the lower orders speak a patois called “ ’Abbasi ”, which is a compound of Russian, Baluch, Arab, and Swahili ingredients. Hindustani is understood by contractors and coohes agents. French is unknown except to a few Customs officials. nglish is more known than French, but probably by not more than a dozen peop 10 . About 100 natives of India are resident here, from Cutch or Shikarpore in Smd, most of whom know Urdu, Persian and Sindhi. Resources. Water. The town contains wells, but the water is invariably bad and brackish, and seems to conduce to guinea-worm and kidney-diseases. The better-off among the inhabitants obtain their supply for drinking from shallow wells at Naiband village, 3 miles to the eastwards, and the demand has given rise to a regular traffic, the supply being paid for. There are also wells on the shore at a distance of 1 mile and 2 miles east of the town • but if -1 I • -i TV XX . UU.U these are brackish. The poorer inhabitants obtain water from reservoiis {birkehs), north and east of the town. This water, which is collected rain water, is also used for washing. There are no arrangements for the supply of fresh water to vessels as there is scarcely enough water to meet the requirements of the inhabitants themselves. The supply could doubtless be improved by building more birkehs ; but if large quantities were required condensing plant wotild be an absolute necessity. Artesian wells might possibl solve the difficulty. Supplies.—In an average year, with a month’s notice, sufficient gram for a force of 7,000 men with followers and transport could probably be col lected. With a week’s notice, it is estimated, that the bazaars of Bandar4 Abbas could meet the demands of a force of 2,000 men, with followers and transport for a week or ten days. There are about 250 cattle and 150 sheep and goats in Bandar ‘Abbas but a larger number could be collected in the district of Shamil (q.v.). No crops are grown in the immediate vicinity of Bandar ’Abbas and all grain is brought from some distance away, i.e., outside a radius of 10 miles Dates, barley a,nd wheat are the chief crops ; but wheat is not largely grown. Grain harvest is in April and May and the date harvest in August and Sep tember. No arrangements for grinding corn beyond the pair of small grind ing stones in every hut. The average normal price of wheat may be taken at Kran 1-60 (he., about annas 7) per maund of 9 lbs., and that of barley at Kran 1 (he., annas 5) per maund. The inhabitants eat meat to a limited and fish to a great, extent. They prefer their flour in the form of wheat! Meat, fish, wheat, barley, dates and a limited supply of onions can generally be obtained in the bazar, but vegetables are only obtainable in small quan tities and at certain seasons, chiefly by reason of the indolence of the inhabitants. Potatoes, pumpkins, brinjals, tomatoes, turnips, carrots, cu cumbers, etc., could do well if sown in January or February, coming to maturity in April and May, provided water were available.* ’ Limes and oranges are grown at Minab (42 miles distant) and are brought thence in December and January. Grapes, pomegranates, quinces and melons are grown in the vicinity of the Kuh-i-Ginau (24 miles distant), and mature in May and June, while for melons there is a double crop, one in May and the second in September. ’ ^ Milk. Milk is scarce and mostly from goats. A little is obtainable, and a few milch animals might be collected from the neighbourhood, but the'total supply would be barely sufficient for a hospital of 100 beds. Fish are obtain able in large quantities being caught in nets worked from the shore, or by wicker basket cages or lines. During the hot months, and in stormy weather they are scarce. Fuel. No coal store ; a small depot exists under a Bushire contractor at Qishrn town for the supply of the Persian Customs steamer and launches but the amount does not exceed 100 tons. Ships that call, coal at Aden! Karachi or Bombay. Fire-wood scanty and expensive. It is brought to the town by native women from the distant hills. The marshy shores of the Clarence straits are covered with thick stunted jungle, which is cut for fire wood and exported to many places in the Gulf, including Bandar ’Abbas. Fodder. There is no grazing to be had in the neighbourhood for horses, camels, mules or cattle. Camel caravans coming to the town, immediately leave, after discharging their loads, the camels being driven out to beyond Baghu (14 miles) to graze. Chopped straw (called bhisa in India and kah locally) and barley, are stored in small quantities to meet the requirements of the few horses, donkeys, etc., of the town. During October, November and December fodder is always scarce, but at other seasons of the year, barley and kah could probably be counted upon for, say 100 animals. The prices normally ruling arefor grass, cts. 70 (about 3§ annas) per maund of 9 lbs.; barley, Kran 1 (about annas 5) per maund and kah, cts. 40 (about annas 2) per maund. These prices must not be taken as arbitrary, everything depending upon the rainfall.5 Transport .—Transport owned in Bandar ‘Abbas is small amounting to only 10 horses and 350 donkeys ; there are no camels. The town is dependent for pack-carriage cn the surrounding district of Shamil, of which the re sources are estimated in the article under that name. During November and April large numbers of camels and donkeys come in ; camels are mostly Afghan animals with Afghan men; sometimes as many as 2,000 or 3,000 are in the neighbourhood, but the owners are said to be unwilling to sell. Mules, ponies, and oxen are not obtainable. These animals are all grazed at least 10 or 15 miles away from Bandar ’Abbas and would require some days to collect and bring in. In the hot season (May to October), it is often extremely difficult to collect even 20 camels, but at other seasons of the year, 100 camels and 30 to 40 donkeys could be collected at a few days’ notice. Owing to the scarcity of the transport and to insecurity, the rates for hire are always very high ; thus the rate per camel to Kirman, the journey to be done in not less than 25 days, would be tumans 16, i.e., Rs. 40 in 1910. The local camel carries about 300 lbs., a mule 200 lbs. and a donkey 180 lbs. There ; are no diseases specially prevalent among the animals of the district. Afghan camels are generally led by strings, local camels are often, and donkeys are always, driven in droves. A man would look after about 10 or 15 animals on the march. Caravans usually march at an hour or two after sunset. Pack saddlery for all animals is of the “ chai-talero ” type in use on grass mules of native cavalry in India, but very heavy and liable to give sore backs. No wheeled transport at all. There are no transport contractors, but Messrs. Ziegler and Company, in their capacity as forwarding Agents, are usually able to procure transport when required, in the cold season. Contracts may be made with the leading Afghans during the winter, as was the case when telegraph material was sent up in 1903-04 for the Central Persian Telegraph line. Many of these Afghans are connected with the subsidized camel cadres at Quetta and in Sistan. There is no skilled labour obtainable of any description whatsoever, and all building materials, except unbaked mud-bricks have to be imported stone from Hormuz Island or Qishm; wood from Karachi and Qishm. Trade .—Local trade with the surrounding district of Shamil is inconsider able, and the Bandar ’Abbas bazar, which contains about 200 shops, is only moderately well supplied with goods. There are no local manufactures. The export and import business of Bandar ’Abbas, though its pre-eminence as the port par excellence of Southern Persia has disappeared since the rise of Bushire and the development of the Shiraz route to the interior, is still valuable. Kirman and even Yazd still fall within the commercial radius of Bandar ’Abbas. From 1908to 1911 the imports increased; but in 1911-12 they decreased.* Exports increased in 1911-12 by 64 % or £119,000, due chiefly to diversion from other routes, the articles being carpets, wool, qhi, almonds and pistachio nuts. In 1910-11 the total imports and exports of Bandar ’Abbas were valued at £626,000 as compared wuth £541,000 of the previous year. Of this 71% was British. The true exports, as distinguished from re-exports, are now cotton, wool, dates, almonds, pistachios, raisins, currants, asafcetida, gum, opium and carpets. A considerable import trade in rifles which was formerly carried C26GSB6 on here has been largely extinguished by the vigilance of the Imperial Persian Customs Department. ^ Trade on the Lar route is carried out by Persian traders, whereas on the , A 1 ™ an . mte ’ m °stly by Indian traders. The bulk of the trade of Bandar Abbas is m the hands of a large British Indian colony consisting chiefly o Hindus and Khojas from Sind. Their head offices are in India, and they have a good financial backing, hence they are able to maintain their trade m spite of disorders, and the absence of any chance of redress. In 1911-12 however, owing to insecurity, trade was much depressed, and some Indian traders failed. European firms. Being mainly a port of entry, and a forwarding base for goods destined for South-East and Central Persia, it follows that the only European firms represented are engaged in the shipping and forwarding trade. Thus,, there are Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., Agents for the British- India Steamship Co., Agencies of the Hamburg-America line of Steamers the Russian line, and Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., forwarding Agents, The Hamburg-America line maintain a monthly servicer The total value of cargo carried by this line to and from Bandar ’Abbas in 1910 was £49,119, an increase of 66 % over the previous year. Robert Wonckhans &amp; Co! are agents at Baadar ’Abbas for the Hamburg-America line. There is no branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Bandar Abbas, and it is possible that the Russian Banque d’Escompte may open a branch there. Military. Defences* There is no good position from which a landing could be op w posed, the hills being too far back from the sea. The only other cover is from the houses of the town of Bandar ’Abbas, and the trees and' gardens of Naiband. The country around the town for a distance of 2 miles is quite open and would afford no facilities in the shape of cover for an enemy attacking, the town from the land side. Bandar ’Abbas is undefended. Forces. —The only armed men are 8 artillery men charged with the duty of firing the sunset gun, and about 40 tufang )his T or armed levies, who are under the orders of the Deputy Governor and the Director of Customs. About 300 or 400 persons, chiefly Laris and Irazls, possess arms* Bandar ’Abbas has no regular force and a week would be taken in col lecting 1,000 undrilled, ill-armed villagers whose military value would be very small, as all are very bad shots, weapons are disgracefully kept, and people of very low morale with no spirit. There are besides, no leaders. Armament. —The arms would be rusty and ill-kept Sniders and Martini, rifles and carbines. Ammunition might be estimated at 200 rounds per rifle (rather less than this really).. No other equipment ; the cartridges being carried in rough bandoliers. Salutes and the sunset gun are fired from one of the old guns, which are drawn up near the Customs House; These guns date from the time of the Portuguese occupation of Hormuz Island. Defence of British Consulate. —The British Consulate compound is an eight-sided building standing in the open, but with dead ground, on. tha*7 .j west at a distance of 500 yards, and rising sandhills to the north and east 800 yards away. A ridge of rock parallel to these sandhills commands the Consulate at long range (1,700-2,000). In 1911 the Consulate was pre pared for defence by raising the wall to 8 feet, and providirg defensible flanking towers at the angles; and a maxim was provided for use from the roof. Harbour. General.—In 1904, a commercial mission, after careful investigation on the spot, came to the conclusion that Bandar ’Abbas was the best and most conveniently situated port in the Gulf, being the natural port, not only of S. E. Persia, but also of the central tract lying between Herat and Yazd, Meshed and Bampur. The roadstead was reported to be better than at Bushire, though, to make the harbour really good, it required dredging, a good pier, and a break water. The mission also recommended as improve ments to the town, sanitation, a sweet water supply, improvement of roads to the plateau, organized transport, and improved customs premises. Roadstead .—-For ships drawing up to 18 feet, about 2| miles from the beach at high water, to the east of the town where a buoy marks the 4 fathom line; for ships drawing more, quite 3| miles out. There is also an anchorage in 20 feet about 1 mile from the customs flag staff. The anchorage is never actually dangerous for ships, but occasionally so for native boats and dhows ; it is seldom rough enough to hamper the discharge of cargo. Ships would never require to put out to sea. There is space for any number of ships. No fixed moorings, but good holding ground, being sandy mud. The worst wind is from the south-east, from which direction the anchorage is least protected, but these winds are rare. The south-west wird is the prevailing wind, and it blows about 300 days in the year. There is no monsoon. There is no bar to the roadstead, which is quite open, though a collection of islands forms a useful natural break-water. Landings. Coast .—Very gently shelving sand ; this is what makes the anchorage so far distant from the beach. There are no cliffs or rocks. At low tide the shore is very flat and even small boats take the ground a hundred yards from the water’s edge. This is especially marked to the east of the town. The shore is composed for the most part of firm sand, and the length available for landing troops and equipment may be taken as about 12 miles. During January particularly, and also December and February, there is often a bad sea on the shore, owing to “ shamal ” winds, here a south-west wind. Bad weather seldom lasts more than two days at a time. Tempo rary landing stages would be difficult to construct owing to (1) absence of local materials, (2) immense length required, (3) difficulty of finding a stable foundation, (4) liability to easy damage from the slightest bad weather. Light tramways, owing to flatness of country, would be easy and eminently useful, except that they could not enter the town because of the narrowness of the lanes.8 Landing has to be effected through the surf in small boats unless the pier is used. Pier.—-A masonry pier in the centre of the town extends about 100 yards into the sea from high water-mark. At low water the pier is absolutely high and dry; at high water boats drawing 6 feet or perhaps 8 feet (at high springs) could be worked at the extreme sea end. Width of pier about 20 yards : it is not strong enough to take heavy guns. No materials available for construction. It world require to be extended 100 yards into the sea to be of use for launches and heavily-laden barges at all states of the tide. At night one Kitson lamp of (about) 100 candle-power lights the pier, the property o' the Persian Customs Department. Goods are landed in lighters, which come alongside the pier only when the tide is high enough to float them. No arrangements for landing animals. Best method would be for lighters to be taken into 6 feet of water and animals turned out into the sea to walk or swim ashore. This is by far the safest as well as quickest method on this beach. Landing appliances .—No cranes on the pier, no tramways, engines, winches, trollies or carts, or any other power except coolie labour. Hawsers would be available only from the gear of the native boats. In the cold weather 200-300 coolies might be available, in the hot weather only about 100. There are a few dilapidated godowns used by the Customs authorities as store rooms ; these are all situated within 2 or 3 hundred yards of the Customs pier. There are no other building suitable for a store depot. Tides and currents.—Rise and fall varies from about 8 feet to 12 feet, according to weather, and neap or spring tides. The difference between high and low water-marks at springs, varies from 400 yards opposite town to 800 yards opposite Naiband. At neaps, variation slightly less. During rough weather, however, landing is extremely difficult owing to long rollers or surf coming in on the flat shore, liable to broach a boat to, and capsize her. They become worse in a SJiamal or Kaus. No inconvenience is ex perienced by small boats by reason of the tides, and there are no dangerous currents, until one reaches a point 3 miles west of the town, where, by reason of the flux and reflux of the tide in the Clarence Straits, strong currents are encountered.

Camping Grounds. The best site on which to encamp troops is situated | mile east-north-east of the town, and in the vicinity of the new British Consulate. There is no9 regular road connecting it with the landing place, but the intervening 'round is composed of loose sand. The water-supply would be precarious, as, on ^ 0U o S ^/ llgMy bracklsh water can be found by sinking a well to a depth of 20 to 30 feet, sweet water would have to be carried from Naiband, 21 miles distant, and then would only be available in very limited quantities. The area available as a camping ground is about 3 square miles. There is also a place near Naiband village where the area available is un limited, flat, well drained, and on sandy soil. This place has the advantage of being near the sweet water of Naiband. ° Administration. Bandar ’Abbas is one of the Gulf Ports, and as such is subject to the Gover nor, who has his head-quarters at Bushire town. The local representative of his authority is a resident Deputy-Governor, who is his nominee; this indivi dual appears to be entitled in theory to exercise official influence over the Kalantar of the Shamil district, whose seat is at Ziarat, but in practice the Kalantar generally succeeds in maintaining a position of equality, and the Deputy-Governor is ruler of the town only. The Deputy-Governor is an un salaried official, who pays a premium for his post, and recoups himself as best he can by the collection of dues and taxes. The incumbent of the office in 1910 is reported to have paid 5,000 tumdns for his appointment for one year, and the highest annual sum ever contracted for is said to have been 14,000 tumdns. From the Deputy-Governor’s sources of income the revenue of the sea custom collected by the staff of the Imperial Persian Customs, is of course excepted. Revenue.—His chief items of revenue are a shop-tax called Asndjlyeh and a passport-tax called Tazkireh. Attempts are made from time to time to increase the revenue by the imposition of various irregular imposts under the names of dalli or brokerage, collected from both seller and buyer at the rate of 2| per cent; of Sar-i-Rigi, a tax levied on goods placed in position for loading on transport animals ; of Maiddnl, a kind of octroi duty at from Iran to 2 krdns per package according to size, and of Askallyeh or pierage, nominally for the up-keep of a pier or Askaleh, at 2| to 5 krdns per package according to size. Rdhddrl or road tolls, nominally for the maintenance of roads and provision of road guards, is not at present levied in the neighbour hood. The Deputy-Governor in fact has carte blanche to make what he can out of the place during his lease, subject only to the restraints imposed by the presence of the Director of Customs and of the representatives of Foreign Powers. The customs receipts of Bandar ’Abbas in 1911-12 were about £37,000 and the expenses of the administration £12,000. The town produces no land or agricultural revenue. _ Law .—Incidentally the Deputy-Governor conducts the general administra tion of the town, and decides criminal and civil cases. He maintains no regular police and his settlement of cases appears to be determined chiefly by corrupt or partisan considerations. As a criminal authority he has power to inflict fine, torture or imprisnment, but death sentences cannot be carried mt without the sanction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The religious luthorities, who in some districts of the Persian coast are respected, and administer at least the semblance of civil justice, appear at Bandar ’Abbaa ;gsbto be utterly venal, and are not spontaneously resorted to by litigants, even as an alternative to the court of the Deputy-Governor. Fanaticism is absent and the ecclesiastical element at Bandar ’Abbas is negligible. There are no leading families : the most influential of the local notables at the present time is the Amin-ut-Tujjar, Haji Husain, who belongs to a family from Galehdar (1905). Customs. —The Persian Government is represented at Bandar ’Abbas by the officials of the Imperial Customs Department, at the head of whom is a Belgian Director, and by a Naib Karguzar or deputy agent of the Persian Foreign Office. The office of the Customs Director has become a general court of appeal from the decisions of the Persian Deputy-Governor, and rela tions between the Director and the general body of Persian officials in the place are strained. The duties of the Deputy Karguzar are nominal. His salary is 50 tumdns a month. The Customs residency is-about 450 yards south-south-east of the British Consulate. Foreign Interests. —Except Great Britain no European Power possesses any tangible interests at Bandar ’Abbas. Great Britain is represented at Bandar ’Abbas by a Vice-Consul, who is also an assistant to the Kesident, Persian Gulf. There is an Assistant Surgeon for plague duty. The Consular escort is nominally 4 Indian cavalry and 16 Indian infantry. The British Consulate is situated about f mile east of the town, and | mile from the shore, in the open sandy plain. It is a strong, well-built, stone build ing of two stories, standing in a compound 70 yards square (see also under Military, Defences) which is enclosed by a six-foot wall of brick in mud. In an adjoining compound, 130 yards by 50 yards, are the telegraph office, a two-storied building, the native infantry lines, hospital, etc., all single-storied mud-brick buildings. There is a well of bitter water in the Consulate com pound, which could be used for drinking in an emergency. Sweet water is obtained from wells at a distance of 2 miles. The old British Consulate is situated at Naiband, on the coast, 3 miles east of the town, and is surrounded by a garden and some trees which constitute almost the only trace of verdure in the locality. To the British Consul are confided the interests of about 70 Hindu and 70 Khoja traders, British subjects, some of whom own trading vessels and pearl-boats : the Hindu community have in addition a serai and temple of their own. The only other Foreign Power locally represented is Russia, who maintains here a Consulate with the staff of a Consul, a Persian Agent, and Armenian clerk, a Persian Mirza, and 10 Cossacks. Russian trade, however, at Bandar ’Abbas is very small, and there is not a single resident Russian subject. Currency, weights and measures. —The currency of Bandar ’Abbas, which is typical of this part of Persia, consists principally of silver and nickel. The silver coins are pieces of 1, 2, and 5 hrcms, the double krdns being the com monest. The nickel coins minted in Belgium are of 100 and 50 Dinars each and are used as small change ; they are styled respectively Dushdhl (or ChcMrpul), Yakshdhi (or Dupul). The money table runs as follows 50 Dinars = 1 Shahi. 20 Shahis = 1 Kran. 10 Krans = 1 Tuman. mdian rupees are also current, and the rate of exchange was 4 krans to i rupee in 1905. The official standard of weight at Bandar ’Abbas, as elsewhere in Persia is die Tabriz man of 640 misqdls, equal to 6'547 lbs. English avoirdupois. The mit generally employed in trade, however, is the so-called ’Abbasi man of ibout 9 lbs. English which is sub-divided as follows :— 1 Man ’Abbasi .. .. .. • • =4 Chehdralc. 1 Chehdrak .. . • • • • • =6 Qiyds. 1 Qiyds .. .. •• .. = 37| Misqdls. The silver one and two-kran pieces are supposed to weigh 1 and 2 misqdls •espect ivebMeasures of length are as below 4 Wehs .. .. .. ' .. = 1 Chehardk. 4 cheharaks .. .. .. .. = ! Zara’-i-Shah or 41-143 Eng- . . _ lish inches. There is also zard-i-das' or cubit of 18 inches, a zard-i-Bandarl of 9 gireks or about 22 inches and a zard-i-Lar of 12 girehs. The English yard is used by cloth-merchants under the name of’ar and is taken as equivalent to 14 girehs. There are no liquid measures, fluids being sold by weight, and no measures of capacity. Square measurements are expressed in terms of length and breadth, and there is no separate table of square measure. ■ There are no banks, their functions being discharged by Hindus and Hai- i; darabadis, of whom there are a large number in the town, and all have agents in Bombay, Karachi and other large Indian towns, and give drafts on those : i places. (See also under Resources, European Firms.) Communications. The inland routes which have their starting points at Bandar ’Abbas are dealt with in the article on the Shamil district. There are no materials available for the construction of roads near Bandar ’Abbas, with the exception of stone, which latter could be procured by blasting the rocks situated 1| miles to the north of the town. Cart traffic would be difficult in the heavy sand, but light tramways could be easily laid, provided wide, flat sleepers were used. Salt stick matting of which large quantities are available, would be useful in making temporary roads if laid sufficiently (say 3 or 4 layers) thick. Posts .—There is a British post office which receives letters for outward despatch for Europe, India, and Gulf ports, at which there may be similar offices. A weekly post from Bombay, Karachi and Masqat arrives on Wednesdays; and a weekly mail from the Gulf ports towards India arrives on Mondays. There is also a Persian post office, from which letters are despatched to inland towns. To Kirman (14 days), leaving on the arrival of the Wednesday steamer. Also a weekly post to Minab, and one to Lar. Telegraph .—No office yet open, but a cable and land line connects Bandar ’Abbas with the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s station at Hanjam Island. This line in 1912 had not been taken over by the Persian Government, The cable reaches the shore at Bandar ’Abbas immediately opposite the Consulate, and the Consulate is connected to the cable both by an earth line and an air line. There are no telephones. There is no telegraphic communication with the interior of Persia, a fact which traders deplore, as telegrams to Tehran, Shiraz, or India all have to go over the cable and are consequently expensive.

BAND-I-KALANG— A halting-place in Bashakard, 70* miles from Jashk, on the road to ^hThas a grove of fair-sized tamarisks, which afford good shade. About 2 miles to the south on the banks of the Rhah Bavag river are the ruins of an old fort, 300 yards long by 200 yards ^.-(Medley and Massy, 1893.) band-i-kashin— _ A river in Persian Baluchistan, about 14 miles south of Bazman. The Talab Nala runs into it, and beyond the junction it is called Shanda- mulla; it joins the Bampur river before it flows into the Jaz Munan Hamun.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894.) BAND-I-MARZ— An important range of hills in Bashakard running north-north-west ' and south-south-east, forming throughout its length the water-shed bet ween those rivers which flow into the Persian Gulf on the south, and those which drain into the Jaz Murian Hamun on the north.Its height is inconsiderable, as mountains go in Persia, nowhere pro bably exceeding 7,000 feet. The KQh-hHamarsun to the west of the Buhang Pass, and the Kuh-i-Bunakin to the east of it, are two of its promi nent peaks. To the south of the Band-i-Marz and parallel to it are two smaller ranges, the Band-i-Nashki and the Band-i-Sirtang, the latter being the nearer to Marz. From the Band-i-Nashki to the top of the Band-i-Marz the rocks appear to be formed of a sort of crystal-—possibly mica—interspersed with gra nite, but on the north side of the Marz range this formation gives place to a kind of hard shale. Ibex and urial are said to be found in these mountains .—(Medley and Massy, 1893.) u BAND-I-NASHKl or BAND-I-VIHI— A range of hills in Bashakard, running parallel fco, and to the south of, the Band-i-Marz. It is crossed by the Anguran-Sikunkan road, about 18 miles north-north east of the former place.—(AMe?/ and Massy, 1893.) BAND-I-NILAG— A high range in Persian Baluchistan, running approximately east and west, at a distance of about 70 miles from the Makran coast, at the mouth of the Rapch river. It is believed to be continued westwards by the Afin-i-Band range of Bashakard, and to be connected on the east with the Lashar Kuh (q.v.). This range is the geographical boundary of Makran, which for a breadth of about 50 miles south of the coast range is more or less hilly. North of the Band-i-Nilag are the open plains of Bampur (q.v.). At Fanuch the range is pierced by a long defile, through which the Fanuch stream escapes southwards to Bint (See Fanuch.) To the west, probably some 40 miles fromFanftch, isthe Shimsan gorge, through which comes the Sadaich river. There may also be intermediate gorges giving passage to the Gidich and Pasga rivers, both large streams. The Pasga, however, is said to originate in the Band-i-Nilag and this may also be the case with the Gidich. According to Floyer, the elevation of the Band-i-Nilag is 3,500 feet. It is much higher than the other ranges and visible from a considerable distance, both north and south.— (Floyer.) Jennings states that when he visited these parts in 1885 he was unable to identify this range by this name, but regards it as likely to be the range called Ramishk (q.v.). BAND-I-NISSAR NALA— A watercourse in Narmashir, between Rigan and Burj-i-Aga Muham mad Khan. The cultivation of Dali Khan and a kdrlz lie about half a mile to the west.BANDlNl- . . A valley or plain in the Bir district, on the coat of Persian Baluchistan* The valley is 8 miles wide from east to west, and perhaps about the same from north to south. It is flat and sandy, almost surrounded by hills and is drained by the Gitu or Bandini Kaur, which escapes south ward through a gap or gorge 300 yards wide and so makes its way to the sea by Homdan villages (q.v.). The telegraph line and road from _ Gwadar to Jashk also passes through the gap, above which is Bandini halting-place the sixth stage from Chahbar and ninth frcm jashk. Water abundant from holes in the bed of the Gitu. Fuel and camel forage also abundant. (Pierce). BAND-I-SHlHRl, see ShAhri (KOh-i-). BAND-I-SHAMKl— A range of hills in Persian Baluchistan, about 3 miles south of the Gidich river (^.v.). The road from Kashi and Karvan northwards to i Bint passes the western end of the range, at 10| to 11 miles from camp, on the Sartapi {q.v.). On the right at the end of the range is a curious castellated hill, and on the left a low hog-backed elevation. Between them is the wide Jambki (forked) Pass (q.v.). Floyer (1876) calls Shariki and Ligandi, another hill about 8 miles to the south, very striking ranges. They are rocky ranges, about 1,600 feet high, standing on an elevation and plateau, and are impassable, except in a few places, even for a man on foot. Towards the south-east they con verge sharply, and a bitterly cold wind comes down the gorge. The Sha riki Nala, which divides the ranges, contains a little brackish water . Here we saw two flocks of sheep and goats feeding on the sandhills, the vegetation of which gonsists almost entirely of trat. — (Floyer^) These ranges appear to be in about the same line as the Gau Kuh (q.v.), and may therefore be in oiie sense a continuation of it. BAND-I-SIRTANG— A range of hills inBashakard, between the Band-i-Marz and the Band- i-Nashki, and parallel to these two i&amp;ngea.—(Medley and Massy, 1893.) BAND-I-VIhT, see Band-i-Nashk!.

BASHAKARD— Lat. 27° 1' 42'; Long. 57° 49' 45'. A mountainous and savage district of south-eastern Persia, which is said to have been formerly an appanage of Ears, but which is now included in the province of Kirman. It is bounded on the west by the districts of Rudbar, Shahri, and Rudan; ,. . on the south by the district of Jashk and by the eograp ica . g U lf from Jashk to the mouth of the Karvan river; on the east by a line running north from here and passing between Tutun and Bint to a point midway between Ramishk and Ispand; and on the north by the Jaz Murian Hamun. Bashakard is the most primitive and backward district in Persia, and probably also the poorest. Until a few years ago no attempt was made to levy taxes, and even now its revenue, paid irregularly and at the rifle’s muzzle, amounts only to 800 tumdns, or about £160 per annum. Durran Khan of Rudbar farms the district, but his post is not an enviable one, especially as he is held responsible for raids. The district is divided into four sub-divisions, all of which pay 200 tumdns per annum, and may therefore be considered to contain an approximately equal population. Starting from the west, Sandark consists of some 15 villages and hamlets, and as it borders on Minab, whither its inhabitants occasionally resort, it is the least savage of the sub-districts. Jakdan (? Jaghdan), further east, was visited by Galindo, who describes its principal village as infinitely squalid and miserable. The district contains 24 villages and hamlets, some of which are close to Jashk. Anguran was visited by Floyer, Massy, and Medley, and has 14 villages, while finally Marz, with its capital Ramishk, boasts of 22 villages and hamlets. The country consists of one main rugged range running from east to west, , which serves as a watershed' to streams drain- Physical features. ^ ^ of or th(j JaZ Murian Hamun. North of this plain is the open plain running down to the hdmun, while to the south the country consists of a labyrinth of rugged and impracticable hills, intersected by huge rocky water courses. The lines of communication mostly follow the latter, but even these are oftenBAS-BAS 77 impassable, owing to the enormous boulders which fill the river-channels and to the great ridges of uptilted strata with which the country is intersected, and which often convert the river-banks into perpendicular scarps many feet m height, at the foot of which the water lies still and deep. The hill-slopes be arthe usually stunted vegetation found in such locali- Vegetation. ties, and wherever there is a small extent of . level ground it is generally sparsely wooded with trees of various thorny kinds, such as the her or hundr, and varieties of the mimosa and acacia families. These often grow to a considerable size, in some cases attaining a height of 40 or 50 feet with a circumference of 6 feet at the base of the trunk. But the all-pervading plant of the district is the palmetto, or dwarf palm, called by the natives fish. This grows in dense masses along all the water courses, and on low-lying ground generally. The stem appears to run along the ground, taking root at intervals and throwing up clumps of broad fan-shaped leaves. These are sometimes 6 or 7 feet high in the more flourishing specimens, and the length of the fan, measured along the mid rib, 2 feet or more. Great use is made by the natives of these leaves. The fibre, after bein^ soaked in water and beaten with a stone, is made into sandals,' which, how^ ever, are not very durable and only last for two or three marches. ’ Their huts are also thatched with a sort of matting made from the leaves, and ropes are made from the same material, while the centre of the young shoots furnishes a kind of soft white stalk, which is not bad eating. The best feature of Bashakard is the abundance of water. Nearly all W a te r . ^ streams have a plentiful supply of running wa b er .- which is almost invariably good, and in this respect, at any rate, the district forms a pleasing contrast to the rest of Persia. Inhabitants. ctanndo gives the following description of the people of Bashakard :— “ There are two very pronounced and very different types of humanity in Bashakard. One, to which I have referred before, has evidently a large admixture of African blood ; in fact I saw numerous examples which might be supposed to be pure negro. Many such were to be seen here at Tutun. I particularly, noticed one half-naked hag, clad only in a filthy rag like a very short petticoat. Her face was of the most pronounced and ill- favoured negro type—huge blubber lips, broad flat nose, prominent cheek bones, and deeply sunk, blood-shot eyes. Her hair was most unmistak able wool, and she was enormously fat, with an arm as thick as a muscular man s thigh, and huge pendulous breasts ; in fact exactly corresponding with the general idea of a Hottentot woman. “ Clinging to the scanty skirts of this lovely creature was a boy, appa rently 10 or 12 years old, as naked as when he was born, with skin of the blue- black negro hue, and crisp woolly hair. Another boy, a little older, was clad only in a kind of short shirt formed of a piece of coarse calico, across the back of which was printed the name of some Manchester firm in big blue letters. Shortly before reaching the village I had met a similar group. A youngish woman, who from her appearance might have been taken for apure bred negro, clad solely in a sort of shirt of a dusty black. She was driving a camel, on which sat a naked boy, while alongside walked another boy who appeared to be 12 or 13 years old, perfectly naked. The whole party were of the genuine blue-black negro tinge. “ The other type, to which I allude, is, I imagine, the original Baluch. The men are of about the medium height, or perhaps a little over it. Their frames are very lean and slender, but sinewy. The face is usually long, with a thin well-cut nose, generally slightly aquiline. The lips are thin. The eyes are large, well protected by the brow, but not too deeply set. The moustache and beard are usually somewhat scanty, but the hair is long and flowing, generally with a slight curl. The colour is very dark, quite as dark as the ordinary Bengali. “ Altogether the face would not be a bad one, were it not for a peculiar and almost indescribable look of wildness and haggardness about the eyes, coupled with an expression of intense watchful cunning. Another notice able feature about the men is that a large proportion of them are deeply scarred about the face, apparently from sword outs. The headman of Murl Kuh, an old man of apparently 70 years, had his face so terribly distorted by huge gashes, that it presented a mixture of the grotesque and the horrible, at which one scarcely knew whether to laugh or to shudder.” Sykes is of opinion that the second type, to which Galindo alludes, is in reality identical with the aborigines of Balhchistan, and is the straight- haired Ethiopian referred to by Herodotus. Massy draws an even more unflattering picture of the natives than does Galindo :— “ The Bashakardis are a very miserable-looking race—underfed, shrivel led up, small-eyed, wizen-faced creatures, the men generally under 5 feet 5 inches in height, and the women small in limb and stunted in growth. There is nothing open and engaging in their countenances, in which poverty and hunger, cunning and avarice, are plainly written. Though constantly armed and almost always fighting among themselves, they are not brave, and though I have heard from themselves long stories of their wars and battles, there was no occasion mentioned in which either side lost more than 4 men killed and about 6 or 8 wounded. But this, they confessed, was quite enough for them. “Thair avarice is most marked and leads even their headmen to commit acts of meanness which would make a Pay Department Babu blush. They are perfectly insatiable, and the more you give the more they wanti Whenever money is given to a headman for a party, the snarling and snap ping reminds one more of a pack of hungry 'pariah dogs than anything else. “Venereal diseases seem to be very prevalent with their usual baneful consequences ; weak eyes and ulcerated throats are common, while deformities of all kinds are not unusual. “ Here, as in most Eastern countries, a large proportion of the fruit is eaten unripe by the hungry and greedy inhabitants. Men, women and children may be seen with handfuls of green dates, crunching them with gusto, and any rare kinds of fruits, such as grapes, pomegranates, melons, etc., are almost invariably devoured before they arrive at maturity.”BA9—-BAS 79 The Bashakardis are, of course, nominally Musalmans, but the bonds of their religion appear to sit lightly on them. Their women do not cover their faces, and indeed they appear to enjoy much more liberty than the females of other Muhammadan countries. Owing partly to its remoteness from the central government, and partly to its poverty, which is such that it is nobody’s interest to improve matters, a state of lawlessness and quasi-independence exists among the chiefs of Bashakard, which is probably unequalled in any other part of Persia. The abundant water-supply, which might easily be turned to good account for irrigation purposes, is allowed to run to waste, and cattle cannot be sent to graze at any distance from their villages without an armed escort. Amongst such a people and in such circumstances industry of any kind is, needless to say, non-existent, and agriculture only of the most primitive character. The inhabitants herd a few flocks of sheep and goats, and depend on their date crops, and a few badly-cultivated patches of Indian- corn and wheat, for a hand-to-mouth livelihood. This low state of civilization is due, no doubt, largely to the charac ter of the people themselves and to the strong strain of negro blood, apparently of a very low type, with which they are tainted, but probably no less to the neglect of the central authority ; and as long as this neglect continues, or until the country comes under a more beneficent govern ment, there does not appear to be much likelihood of its rising in the scale. — (Galindo, 1888 ; Massy and Medley, 1893 ; Sykes, 1902.) BASHIB— Bashib, the road from Jashk to this village, crosses the rivers Marik and Tararqand, and passes three villages, one about 13th mile, the second about 15th mile, and third 17th mile. They are surrounded by date trees and situated about a mile from the sea. The village of Bashib is inhabited by Baluchis, and there are a few huts also scattered over the ground. There is a small bit of ground cultivated with wheat, and the water is good from the spring. Other supplies are very sc&amp;ice—(Shaikh Mohi-ud-Din, 1893-94.) BASHUR— A plain in Makran, some 5 miles wide, 7 miles from Pish Mant, on the Chahbar-Geh road. It is composed of whitish clay intersected by ndlds. On it lies Chah Shur, a salt well.— (Sykes ; Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) BlSlDU— A British station situated on the westernmost point of Qishm Island, about 25 miles east by north of Lingeh town: there is also an Arab village of the same name about 1 mile to the eastward. Basidupoint is a low cliff, rising 20 feet above high-water mark, and is level with a few date-trees: it is an airy position open to all the winds that blow. The station was practically unoccupied, from the time when the Indian naval squadron was abolished, until 1910, in which year it was re opened as a coaling station in connection with the suppression of the mascat arms-traffic. The former officers’ quarters, hospital, sepoy lines, bazar,80 BAS—BAS and store-houses were, accordingly, allowed to fall into disrepair. Some of them are now (June 1910) being repaired, and when the work is finished there will be accommodation for some half-dozen Europeans, and a dozen native employes. A good stone pier, extending to water mark, leads to the coal wharf. There is a bungalow, near the flagstaff, | mile south of the point which is being repaired. There is also a rest house, a forge, and a wireless station, of which the two_ latter adjoin one another. There are three reservoirs, in good repair, which are also used by the local population. A rifle range, laid out to 600 yards, still exists. There were never any per manent defences, but, in 1910, a non-commissioned officer and 6 men of the Indian Army were sent there as a guard. The population of the staion, before it was re-opened in 1910, comprised some 50 souls. The station benefits by a shamdl breeze during the summer. There are some Portu guese ruins near the station. The Arab village consists of about 200 huts and is included within the bounds of the British jurisdiction. The people are fugitive slaves, Sunnis by religion, and gain a living as fishermen and weavers of lunqis. The village has no trade and affords few supplies except water, for the collection of which there are 8 reservoirs. There are about 25 donkeys, 50 cattle and 400 sheep and goats. The anchorage at Basidu extends parallel to the shore on the north side of the point and consists of a belt J mile broad at | mile from the shore : the depth is 5 to 7 fathoms and the bottom of clay, is good holding ground. The landing is inconvenient in a swell on account of the rockiness of the coast, and at low-water on account of a mud flat which is then uncover ed. Outside the anchorage lies a channel 12 to 16 fathoms deep called the “Gut,” in which vessels avoid anchoring. Protection against the Shamal, which here blows from south-west by west, is given by the northern point Beacon Shoal, a narrow bank which curves round the west end of Qishm island from Basidu point for two-thirds of the way to Has Dastakan ; of this bank the northern half, about 2| miles V&gt;ng, is dry at low water and has its extremity marked by a beacon. There is a deep but narrow and unnavigable channel between Beacon Shoal and the coast of the island. Other important features of the approaches to Basidu are the “ North Bank ” and the “ Flat.” The former is a westward pro longation of the middle shoal of Clarence Strait which has its final ending in the sea 7 miles west-south-west of Basidu point. The flat is a great bank carrying 2 to 3 fathoms at low water and lying round the whole south-w3stern corner of Qishm Island. It extends for more than 20 miles along the coast, about | of its length covering the western and the remainder the southern side of the island, and its northern end overlaps the south end of the Beacon Shoal and is outside'it. The main entrance to the Basidu roadstead begins between the Flat and the North Bank where it is 2 miles wide and has 3| fathoms of water ; it then runs between Beacon Shoal and the North Bank deepening as it goes to 7 and eventually to 9 fathoms. There is a subsidiary passage between the coast of the island and the Flat as far as Beacon Shoal where it joins the ordinary entrance ; it has been used by a steamer drawing 14 feet, but it is imperfectly, known. — {Lorimer t 1906 ; Craufurd, 1910.)81 BAS—BAZ BASlBAN —Lat. 31° ST' 24' • Lojsrr 4' 4-^' n t \ -rrt (Sykes.) 4 45 ~( Lentz ) &gt; Elev - 4,800'— Ft.

BAZMAN HlMtiN— ^ This Tidmun is situated to the south-west of the Rizabad Band (mountain range) and to the north-east of the Kuh-i-Bazman. {Jennings, 1885.) BAZMAN, KUH-I or KUH-I-ZINDEH— Elev. 11,217'. A mountain chain in Persian Baluchistan, composed of parallel ranges,, running down from a great peak, with a general north and south bearing. The principal peak is an extinct volcano, from the summit of which a mag nificent view is obtained. It is thus described by Brazier-Creagh :— “ From the top of the peak which rejoices in a multiplicity of names, viz., . . ... Madar Kuh, Meh Kuh, Khadreh-i-Zindeh Kuh, ZindehKfih” ^ Z!ndel1 K ' ll &gt; Kuh, etc., a splendid and striking view for over 150 miles can be seen, except a bit to the north shut out by Chehil peak. The altitude we made out to be 11,423 feet. To the south, far beyond the Jaz Murlan Hamun and the Bampur lut, the pale-blue Lashar, Band-i-Nilag, Yazbag, Band-i- Fanuch and Ramishk ranges are visible. To the west are seen the lofty snowclad ranges .stretching up to Kirman, viz., Jabal Bariz, Shah Savaran-, (i.e., the Shah on horseback), HudianKuh, Kuh Hazar and Kuh Jupar„. K.84 flAZ—BAZ 4^ To the north-west the open Kirman desert stretches as far as the eye can reach, separated from the Galugan plain by the Rizabad Band. To the north-east lies the Sianeh range and all between us and it. viz ., Jauri Band, Da min Kuh, Pan] Angusht, Mur Pish, Garinchin and Birk with their intervening plains. To the south-east Ispidan, Humand and Mulatan peaks are plainly visible, beyond which are the Sarbaz hills. Beneath us are the low ranges surrounding Bazman and conspicuous amongst them are the conical-shaped Bacherama Kuh, the jagged white limestone Almah Kuh, Banaksimo and Banda Kamio. The Bazman range ends abruptly on the north in low sandhills, which seem to run out and split the plain. Six hdmuns are seen. The one directly north of Bazman under the Rizabad Band receives the drainage of the plain from Shuraf vid the Halil Rud, where we crossed the watershed ; it also receives that from the Kaleh Mazar Hamun through the Sam Sur exit, and that from the north-east slopes of Bazman. Over the Jauri Band is seen the Kaleh Mazar Hamun which has already been described. Between the Bazman and Hudian ranges, near Rigan another hdmun is seen, and in the centre of the Kirman desert is the Ab-i-Riz Hamun. Still farther off, on the vast Dasht-i-Lut, are the Shurgaz and Namaksar hdmuns. On the Bampur plain, south-west is the large Chah Shur, Jaz Murian or Milan-i-Jihun Hamun, which receives the Bampur, Kaskin and Halil rivers and the entire southern drainage of the Bazman and Jabal Bariz ranges. On the last 200 feet of the Kuh-i-Zindeh, huge boulders of red rock lie Composition of KuhJ- scattered about. The spaces between the bould-» Zindeh. ers and the ground along the precipitous sides are composed of soft dust and crumbling pumice. It was impossible to form any definite idea of the exact strata as the depth of snow precluded a thorough examination, but there cannot be any doubt but that the entire Bazman range is volcanic, although now dormant. At the base of the south ern side of the sugar-loaf, at an elevation of some 8,000 feet, is a deep ndld under the GalamI Kuh (a red jagged brick-like hill) which we crossed at the foot of the main peak. From this granular sulphur is obtained : it is in irregular particles and has to be dug out with a pick. A quantity of sulphur and geological specimens were secured. Up to 7,300 feet several fine fig and qwdm trees are seen, and, as on the Chehil range, quantities of asafoetida grow along the hillsides and over the stony plateaux. I recog nised three varieties— king, hustan and 'patheric ; I, however, failed to find the rab mentioned by Colonel Bell and Captain Jennings, although I made repeated enquiries. There is good shooting on this range. I got several good gad or guch-i- huh (wild sheep) heads, also ibex. Wolves, hysenas and leopards are also found. In the vicinity of Bazman village chikor, duck, partridge and snipe were also daily bagged.”— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.) of 'V'iTZcicres dncf.

It is situated on the south (left) bank of the Kaju river (q.v.), about the point where that stream makes its southerly turn for the Bagrband hills. The village of Hait (q.v.) is about 3 miles further up the river on the opposite side. Both villages can be seen from the neighbourhood of Qasrqand, and each appears to be situated at the eastern end of an extensive date grove. HajI ’Abdul Nabi passed through Bhug in 1839, and says it was 12 kos (about 16 miles) from Geh over a generally level stony road. The chief was then one Mir Murad, probably a Gichki. He lived in a small fort surrounded by date trees. His revenue appeared to be 20,000 mans of grain and 1,000 packages of dates. The maunds are probably ChahbarBHU-BIA mpunds, equalling one Company’s seer. However, the cultivation of the place (including Het ?) must have been nearly equal to that of Qasrqand, which is considered very fertile for the country. There is a route from Bhug direct to the coast at Puzim (q.v.). HajI ’Abdul Nabi travelled it. The first 12 miles appears to be down the Kaju. Then a night’s journey to Piri Gaii, a pool of water; and another night’s journey to the coast plains at “ Surkum ” (Sohrkumb ?); thence one stage to Puzim. The road from Bhug to Qasrqand is good. In 1885, according to Jennings, whose information is from native report, this place contained about 10 houses and 500 sheep, with abun dance of wood, water and grazing, and is the sixth stage from Bampur and the 4th from Ohahbar.— (Jl djl Abdul IS obiLovett' f Jennings.) BlABAN DISTRICT— A district of the Persian coast, included in the administrative province known as the Gulf Ports ; it is intermediate between the Gulf Ports district of Minab on the north and the Makran district of Jashk on the south and it flanks, upon the eastern side, the passage which connects the Gulf of ’Oman with the Gulf of Persia. The district is bounded on the west by the sea, and on the east by the crest of range of hills which runs parallel to the coast at a distance of 10 to 15 miles inland, dividing Blaban from the districts of Rudbar and Bashakard. On the north, the boundary with Minab district is a line which passes between Boundaries. tlie villages of Zlarat, Dudar, Kaleh- i-Gat and Taling and the Biaban villages of Bundram, Guvasmand and Garuk ; on the south, the boundary with the Jashk district passes between the Biaban villages of Bunji and Bashib and the Jashk village of Kuh Mubarak. The district is thus about 50 miles in length from north to south, and from 10 to 20 miles in breadth. The chief range of hills is that forming the eastern boundary of the dis trict ; it is known as the Kuh-i-Biaban. In the north, near Guvasmand it reaches an altitude of 1,962 feet, and in the south it has a peak 3,946 feet in height. Between Kuh-i-Biaban and the sea are several minor ranges, Physical features. which begin near the coast and tend gradually away from it in a south-easterlv direction towards the main range ; these ridges have no general names, and are called after the villages near which they pass. They are entirely of sandstone, assuming, in places, curious and grotesque shapes and lending themselves to varied uses as forts, sto e houses for grain, etc. In one peak, these subsidiary ranges attain a height of 899 feet. The principal streams in order from north to south, are the Gaz, Hivai, Karai, Biriz, and Zangali—all of which except the Karai and the Biriz, flow down from the main range to the sea. The Gaz, which passes about a mile north of the village of Gaz, derives its name from the tamarisks which grow in profusion along its banks.

It follows that the Rah-l-Dana is use in summer and the Bah-i-Kiih in winter It should be noted that Ae inhabitants of Biaban consider all water “good “ without immediate evil results; this fact should be borne in mind in con suiting the table of villages given below. The district possesses about 300 camels and 500 donkeys, bu only sufficient for the requirements of the owners, and no considemble demand for transport could be enforced without hardship to the people.

A large village and sub-district in Makran, situated on the Bint or Fanuch river, 20 miles south of Fanuch and about 45 due west of Geh. The district is hilly, but traversed by several streams, on which are numerous villages and date groves of generally minor importance ; but considering it as a whole, it is said to be fertile. The village is situated in the centre of a long line of date groves on the western bank of the river, and is overlooked by a square mud fort built on a high steep hill, round which cluster some 70 strongly constructed houses. To the west is a ruined natural wall, formed by a stratum of hard yellow sandstone projecting from the surface. One hundred yards beyond this is an advanced tower, 40 feet high. The town is entered from this side through a breach in the natural wall. The streets, if they can be so called, are steep, narrow and filthy; their uses as public ways being subordinate to their value as manure beds. In fact, the houses of Bint, like those of Fanuch, Maskhutan and other Baluch towns, stand in what closely resembles one of the yards used in England for wintering cattle, every nook and corner throughout the town being spread thickly with “ kik ” grass, roots, and old rice straw, and deep in manure. The smell at some seasons must be fearful. No wonder that these places are un healthy, and that cholera and other epidemics occasionally make fear ful ravages! The quantity of straw lying about, the sparrows, and the substantial appearance of the well-thatched houses, give the place the look of the back part of a very slovenly English homestead. The gardens and date groves of Bint are about f mile wide, and to wards the south reach the edge of the river-bed, which is, however, so large and full of loose shingle that it is not easy to get to the running stream. Many huts are scattered among the date groves. These are for the most part circular ; average diameter 20 feet; height 7 feet, covered by a light strong dome 10 feet high formed of a framework of date-sticks, thatched with pish, and covered with rope netting. The population, who are mostly Baluchis, with a certain number of slaves, was estimated by Goldsmid in 1866 as about 2,000 ; Floyer, in 1897, gave it as 700 ; while Sykes, in 1893, was informed it was about 2,000, but he did not visit the place himself. The people are supported mainly by their dates and about 100 acres of grain crops, which, in the order of the respective areas devoted to each, are —English horse beans, wheat, rice, and barley. A small quantity of infam ous tobacco is also grown. The soil is a stiff blue clay, requiring to be con stantly manured, and the manure is collected in the spaces between the M 2houses of the village. The irrigation is carried on by a canal, but the arrangements for the distribution of the water are so bad, that some crops wither while others drown. The stream is led into four fields, making a total of about 6 acres daily, and the land holders;—all great men—take their turn according to their rank, and not according to their acreage. The manufactures of Bint are:—a coarse white cloth made from cotton grown in the country; leather articles, as shoes, belts, and bullet pouches, water bottles from the porous blue clay of the Gidich; gauzy handker chiefs for women, badly dyed red and green, and embroidered with floss silk brought from Masqat; also elaborately embroidered skull caps. The last named are the only articles for which there is any demand outside the district. There is no regular trade. After an unusually good year, sheep and ghi are sometimes sent to Masqat and Bandar Abbas in exchange for floss silk and piece-goods. The money current consists of dollars, rupees, krdns, half-ibwis, and floss silk. Camels are plentiful, larger than coast camels, but not proportionately more enduring, owing to their more succulent food. Donkeys are few and dear, imported from ’Oman ; sheep poor ; cows few. There was only one horse at Bint in 1876. Religion is of great importance here, as in other towns of this region, but among the nomadic part of the population it is entirely absent. The mullas of Bint represent themelves as Sunni of the sect of Abu Hanifa, while they are really unadulterated Sufis. There is a good masjid and a school attended—in 1876—by twelve youths who paid 10 dollars for being taught the Koran or Hafiz. These young men appear to retain little of their religion after arriving at a marriageable age. Floyer remarks (in 1876) that the main subjects of conversation at Bint as elsewhere in Persian Baluchistan, were the tyranny of the “ Gajars ” (Persians) and the intense desire of the Baluchis that the English should take their country—an event they confidently expected to take place shortly. Its mdlidt in 1893 was estimated at 1,000 tumdns ; while the revenue of the three districts of Geh, Bint and Dasht amounted to Rs. 40,000 in 1902. The Bint or Fanuch river is one of considerable importance in Makran. It has its source in five separate streams,* rising in the hills north of Fanuch where the watershed divides the drainage of the Bampur river from that flowing south to the Persian Gulf. Below Fanuch it passes through the famous gorge of that name, and being joined by the Gari and the Maluran rivers, runs approximately south for some 20 miles, when the Pasga river and other minor tributaries unite with it.

John remarks that the name may possibly be “ Kuh-i-Burui but more probably a contraction of Kuh-i-Buzurg.” ‘ J&gt; Conformably with the general lie of the ranges in this part of Persian Baluchistan, the Kuh-i-Birg runs north-west and south east. Its southern end is near the village of Magas and its northern in Sarhad, somewhere At leaR Haji’Abdul Nabi, travelling in 1838 from Vasht to Ermdagan, or, according to Jennings, Rindigan (^.u.) makes no mention of crossing a range, so he must probably have passed the ejid of it—a supposition which is to some extent supported by his statement that the “Kuh-i-Bir” bounds Sarhad to the south. Its total length may therefore be about 40 miles. The Kuh-i-Birg, as seen from Kushan on the eastern side of the Magas plain is_ a lofty and imposing range of mountains, with steep rugged sides and vividly tinted rocks.” Haji ’Abdul Nabi says that about twenty camel-loads of cardamums are gathered yearly on the Kuh-i-Birg. They are bought by Hindu traders from Dizak and taken down to Gwadar. •rr e ol °gj ca l formation of the range is nummulitic limestone associated with red shale ; the large limestone hill of Mulatan, to the south-east of agas is on the strike of the Kuh-i-Birg, and the same strike is prolonged Shairas Kuh and the limestone masses near Hung (Hap Abdul Nabi-, St. John-, Blanford.)

BIR-BIR BIRlNTl— Blev. 610'. the Rudan district situated A village in the Rudan district situated on the right bank of the Manujan river, 2 miles above its junction with the Rudkhaneh-i-Duzdl, 19i m iles from Minab, on the road to Rigan. It is near the junction of the Duzdi and Minab rivers, and contains about 200 inhabitants, who own about 80 cows and 120 donkeys. The village possesses 14 ploughs, and 420 mans of seed (jau and millet) are sown annually, besides which a little henna and indigo is cultivated, and there are 8,000 date palms. Good water is obtained from the Manujan river. Supplies in small quan tities are procurable, and there is fuel and camel grazing in abundance. There is a good camping-ground.— {Sykes, 1898 ; Napier, 1899 ; Grey, 1905.) BIRlZ— A hamlet on the coast of Makran, about 24 miles west of Gwatar on the * road to Chahbar. Water is obtainable from wells, but supplies are scanty. The Indo-European Telegraph line cuts in about halfway between Biriz and Kachu.— {Brazier-Creagh, 1893; from native information.)

BIRJAND.— Lat. 32° 53' 7' ; Long. 59° 10' 15’; Buev.*) 4,760' — {Smtjth). 4,740'— {Gore). A town in Khorasan, about 240 miles south of Meshed. It is situated on the northern slopes of a barren stony valley, principally on the left bank of the Birjand river, which comes down from Bujd, and it completely covers a low ridge which runs parallel with the stream. The bed of the river remains dry for years together, and is only after heavy snow and rain that water is found at all, and then only a tiny stream. Water is obtained from irrigation channels. That portion of the town built on the left bank was formerly' 3 enclosed by a wall, with numerous gates and doors, but this is now in ruins. The whole town occupies a space of about 1 mile by mile and has a population of about 25,000 souls. The houses are all domed, and built of sun-dried brick and are generally of a poor description. There is no covered bazar, but there are several streets of shops, in which Russian and British goods are displayed for sale, the former predominating. The town contains a madrasseh, 7 mosques, 6 baths, 6 caravanserais and about 300 shops. The ark or citadel is situated at the foot of the hill to the east, and is a huge square enclosure, with the usual bastions and towers. It has no impor tance as a fortification, as it is in a dilapidated state, and is commanded from several excellent sites for batteries to the north-west, north and north-east. It is closely surrounded by buildings and its water-supply could be cut off. In 1903 the ark contained 10 guns ; 5 of those were 9-pr. brass rifled, muzzleloading guns mounted on old dilapidated field carriages, smothered in dust and dirt; the remaining 5 were lying about the ground in the topkhaneh. There were also 30 artillerymen stationed in the ark. Jn addition to the artillerymen the garrison consisted of one regiment, nominally 500 strong, but most of the men are away at their houses for the greater part of the year. The regiment is inspected once a year, when the men muster. The men are clothed in ragged uniform, and are generally bare footed. The rifles are antiquated and rusty muzzle-loaders. To the west of the town, at the end of the spur, is situated a fort which is a much more respectable work. It is a square of about 100 yards, with walls 40 feet high, built on the river-bank ; which is scarped to the north, and the approach to it all round is difficult and steep. If put into good repair, no doubt this place might offer a respectable resistance ; but there is cover close up to it, and the walls and loopholes are in such a state that the former could not be manned. The fort is also commanded by a hill at about 1,500 yards to the east, and is in ruins now. The chief manufactures of Birjand-are felts, carpets, and woollen fabrics, copper vessels and leather-tanning. The carpets, for which the locality has long been famous, are chiefly fabricated in the 'village of Durukhsh about 50 miles to the north-east of Blrjand ; also at the villages Nauzad and Sehdeh. These carpets, however, are now held in less esteem ; aniline dyes being used, and cotton mixed with the wool of which they are manufactured. Aniline dyes are now strictly forbidden and carpet manufacturers using them are liable to punishment. Cotton is, however, mixed with the wool. The carpets are very much in demand. Trade. The chief trade of Birjand is with Khorasan and Russia, Bandar Abbas and Kirman. Trade with Afghanistan has been practically killed by Persian Custcms (Belgians), and is now a negligible quantity. British trade with Birjand is now said to be nearly equal, if not quite so, to Russian trade. This is probably due to the disturbed condition of Russia. In 1904- 05 the total imports and exports amounted to 1,419 and 1,789 camel loads, valued respectively at 3,05,990 and 2,68,125 rupees. ’ This was, however, a bad year, owing to a cholera epidemic and all travellers coming from Khorasan or Yazd were stopped and turned back, while the people of Birjand deserted the town in lage numbers and sought asylum in the hill villages off the main routes. The chief imports are shirtings (nearly all cotton fabrics are British or European, imported by way of Bandar Abbas), indigo, longcloth, chintz, spices, sugar and petroleum, while the exports are carpets, barak, and kurk (a species of cloth), wool, saffron, and dried fruits. Of late years the trade with Afghanistan had declined considerably owing to the harsh man ner in which customs collection at Sarakhs, Duruh, and Ahwaz were car ried out. The consequence is that Afghans are now generally employing the routes that lead through Turbat-i-Haidari. Birjand is of great antiquity, and though much decayed, is still a place of considerable importance, and on account of its greater proximity to Sistan and the Afghan frontier has supplanted Kain as the seat of Government of the Kai- nat. Since the days of Nadir Shah up to the time of Yar Muhammad’s death in 1871, Birjand was a dependency of Herat.104 BIR—BRI There is a British agency and a telegraph office with British, Russian and Persian telegraphists in the town .—(Napier ; Yate ; Mania BaJchsh ; Wan- liss, 1903; Macpherson, 1906; Gibbon, 1908.) BlR KAUR- A stream, or watercourse, which runs southwards from the hills to the sea through the Bir district of Persian Baluchistan. It does not appear to be of any great size and is dry except after rain. This watercourse is crossed by the telegraph road from Chahbar to Jashk at about 66f miles from the former. It is usually made the fifth stage from Chahbar and tenth from Jashk. Water is obtained from holes in the bed of the watercourse and is plentiful. Fuel and camel fodder moderate. To the east of the Bir is the Napaga Vad plain ((/ -y.). Goldsmid in 1866 descended for some miles a stream which he calls the “ Tenk ” (Tank). It appears to be the upper course of the Bir (see Tank).— (Lockhart's Baluchistan Gazetteer.) BIRK KHAUN— Said to be a hamlet of 15 houses in Bashakard, 33 miles south of Marz # on the road to Anguran. Supplies are procurable in moderation.—. (Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; from native information.) BlR RIVER— A tributary of the Minab river in the Kirman district, containing perennial water. It crosses route Khanu to Minab at mile 30. Here, at a place called Shamsabad, is a date-palm grove, also some cultivation.— (Jennings, 1885.) BlZINJAN— A village, and the head-quarters of a small district of the same name, in Kirman, situated on the left bank of a tributary of the Halil Rud, 7 miles from Baft and 13 miles from Rabur. It is the head-quarters of the Lak tribe, and consists of about 300 houses. An alternative road from Baft to Bandar Abbas passes through it, and supplies of all kinds are procur able. The mdlidt of the district is 3,000 tumdns.—(Sykes, 1900 : Consular Report, 1903). BORAH- An important village in Kirman, 4 miles east of Bam, on the road to Rigan. It has a population of 5,000 and exports annually 120,000 lb of henna besides grain and dates.— (Sykes, 1902.) BOT— A village of Persian Baluchistan.

BRINJlNAN— Elev. 4,600'. * ^ A pass in the Kuh-i-Siahan range, in Persian Baluchistan, 14 miles from Kalpurkan, on the road to Jalk. The pass presents no difficulties forcamels, or even for wheeled artillery, which has several times been taken over it by the Persians. The camping-ground is about 1|- miles on the eastern side of the pass; but water is only procurable from the head of a branch ndld 2 miles from this place. Fuel and grazing are abundant.— {Showers 1902 • Grant 1902.) ’ * BRINJNAN, vide Brin jin an. BRIS— A village in Persian Makran {q.v.), BUABAD— I A small village, consisting of 15 houses, lying 2 miles to the west of the road from Sarbisheh to Sehlabad in the Kain district of Khorasan, 10 miles from Sarbisheh and 16 miles from Sehlabad.

BUDl, see Buding. budik- A village in the Shamil district (g.'U.). BUDING— A camping-ground in Bashakard, 391 miles from Jashk, on the road to Anguran. It is situated on the north bank of the Jahln river, the camping- ground opposite to it, on the south bank, being called Budl. The water from the river, though muddy, is sweet, and there is some camel-grazing a short distance to the north-west. About l mile south of Budi is a Baluch burial-ground, the graves of which are of brick and stone, some of the superior ones being even enclosed by small stone walls. The climate is intensely hot in summer, 117° F. having been registered at mid-day in June.— {Medley and Massy, 1893.) BUG (No. 1)— A village in Persian Baluchistan, about 9 miles west or west-south-west of Qasrqand, to which it apparently belongs. It is situated on the left bank of the Kaju river {q.v.), about the point where that stream makes its southerly turn for the Bagrband hills. The village of Het {q.v.) is about 3 miles further up the river on the opposite bank. Both villages can be seen from the neighbourhood of Qasrqand, and each appears to be situated at the eastern end of an extensive date grove. Hap Abdul Nabi passed through Bug in 1839 and says it was ;about 16 miles from Geh over a level stony road and that the cultivation of the place must have been very nearly equal to that of Qasrqand. Cl I. BN-V 106 BUG-BUG There is a route from Bug direct to the coast at Fazm {q.v.). The first 12 miles appear to be down the Kaju. Then a night’s journey to Pir-i-Garn, a pool of water ; and another night’s journey to coast plains at Sohrkumb (?)/ thence one stage to Fazm. The road from Bug to Qasrqand is good. Jennings, from native reports, says this place (in 1885) contained 10 houses and 500 sheep, with abundance of wood, grazing and water and as the sixth stage from Bampur and the fourth from Chahbar. y BUG (No. 2)— ; ; Elev. 5,674'. A halting-place on the route from Ladisto Sehkuha, 20| miles from the former and 16| miles from Kurgar, the next stage onwards. There is no water here, and the proper camping-place should be 4 J miles back, in the river-bed north-west of the Dar-i-Biaban Kutal, where perennial water, grass, grazing and wood, 1|- miles down the nala, are to be obtained. Here at Bug is grazing, and grass on the hills except in winter ; also wood. The main hills are about 1 mile distant on the right and 3 miles on the left.— (Jennings.) Tighe in 1902 describes this place as a camping-ground in Sarhad, 24 miles south-south-east of Ladis. It consists of a well of brackish water, on the banks of the Bug Kaur, about 4 miles above its junction with the Gazu river.— (Tighe, 1902.) BUGANl— A halting-place in the Pishin district of Persian Baluchistan. It is on or near the Sarbaz river, about 9 miles from the point where it emerges from the hills. Rask (q.v.) on the Sarbaz, within the hills, is 15 miles north-west, passing Baftan village at 10 miles. Pishin is 10 miles east. Bahu Kalat is about 2 stages south down the river. The ordinary camping-ground is south of the river. The road from Baftan (q.v.) leads for 6 miles over the plain on the left bank of the river to which it then descends by a very steep and rocky pass. Having crossed the river it continues through a thick low jungle of tamarisk and caper to the camping-ground, which is reached round a bed of the river. There is a deep pool here. Wood and water abundant, but no in habitants or signs of cultivation. The Bahu road continues down the river, but the Pishin road crosses the river and ascends to an elevated plain on the left bank. It is stony and quite flat. After 4 miles a belt of sparse acacia jungle is entered, and at 6 miles the road reaches the outlying cultivation and date groves of Pishin. rJ Travellers to that place from the Sarbaz villages, however, had better keep along, and camp on the left bank, thus avoiding two crossings.— (Euan-Smith.)BUGHAU— A village in Makran, containing 20 houses, situated on the banks of the Gvimak Kaur (q.v.). — (Showers, 1902.) BUGSAB —Elev. 5,100'. A camping-ground in Sarhad, 32 miles north-east of Ladis, on the road to Kacha Kuh. It is an open space in the hills, and affords fair grazing. There is a spring of slightly bitter water. BUIKUN (Persian Baluchistan) — A village in Bashakard district. It is the third halting-place from Bamishk on the road to Jashk. , BUJD— Lat. 32° 50' 4'; Long. 59° 17' 30'— (St. John) ; E 51 (Mohi-ud-Din.) A village of Khorasan in the Naharjan huluk of the Kain district, 7 miles east-south-east from Birjand. It is built along the side of alow ridge which runs down the centre of the Birjand valley. Now, however, it has only some 200 houses. Above the village is a ruined fort and the houses are built in terraces down the slope. It is a picturesque village, and has a large radius of cultivation, chiefly cotton and wheat, with numerous jujube trees, mulberries and poplars. It is plentifully supplied with water by qanals from the Kuh Baqaran hills to the south-east, and supplies are procurable. It has an importance, as being the place whence all the roads east of Birjand radiate, viz., to Herat, Sabzawar (Afghanistan), Fareh, Lash, and Sistan. The village produces annually about 800 kharwdrs, i.e., 13,600 Indian maunds of wheat, barley and millet and could supply a force, ’Abbas ’All maintains, of 500 horsemen. The market rates are :— Wheat 2 mans or 3f Indian seers per hr Cm. Barley 3 ,, ,, 5-2 ,, ,, ,, ,, Bhusa 14 ,, ,, 25-g- ,, ,, ,, ,, In the Dasht-i-Bujd there is good grazing for camels and sheep and fodder is stored against the winter. The livestock consists of about 80 head of cattle, 1,000 sheep and goats and 100 donkeys. Fuel (unah, mulberry, etc.) is plentiful.—(MacGregror ; Goldsmid ; Euan- Smith ; BeUew ; Mohi-ud-Din ; Maula Bakhsh ; ’Abbas ’All, 1907.) BUQ— A village in Geh (q.v.) in Makran.

Seen from the west it appears conical in shape.— {Medley and Massy, 1893.) BUNDARAN (Nala)— A water-course in Sarhad, south of the Gili Kuh. It rises in a kutal of the same name some 3 miles to the north-west of where the road from Jalk to Ladis crosses it. It is about the longest branch of the Hinjirok Nala. Jennings halted here on his journey from Jalk to Ladis, the halting- place being at the junction of the Bundaran and Razzak Nalas ; the latter name is, however, not known here, both branches being called by the same name. Height of camp, 5,855 feet. Water, wood, grass, and grazing abundant. Thousands of sheep and goats in the neighbourhood. The kutal is reached 3| miles from this halting-place, the road following the main ndld. It is an undulating stony plateau, in height about 6,419 feet above sea-level, and is the water-parting between the Hinjirok and Drukan Nalas. Ascent 1 in 50. The main Dnikan Nala is to the right and rises in Gili Ku,tal. A road runs over Gili Kutal to Mashkid, reported bad.— {Jennings.)

Perennial sweet water in river-bed ; grazing, wood and grass abundant.— (Jennings, 1885.) ' • BUN RUD— A tiny hamlet in Makran, 19 miles north-west of Pip, on the road to Maskhiitan. It is situated on a river flowing west or north-west. {Sykes, 1893. from native information.) BUNSIR (Pass)— A pass or kutal over the Sianeh Kuh range, about 13 miles north-west of Isfandak, on the route from that place to Talk. The summit is 4,786 feet high and is a level stony plateau of shale and sandstone, 100 yards wide, and is the highest point on the Sianeh Kuh which the road crosses between Isfandak and Talk. The ascent, which commences as far back as Isfandak, is very gradual and the descent too is easy. All drainage up to this point runs south and south-east to the Mashkid river on the Isfandak plain. All drainage onwards runs north and north-east mo the Kalaghan Nala to the Mashkid river, joining the latter to the east of Talk on the desert. The following is a description of the pass given by St. John :— “ 0ur roa(i l a J across the plain in a north-westerly direction to the hills, which we entered by an easy pass called the Gudar-i-Bunsir. The summit is about 4,500 feet ^.ovethesea • • • • • Seen from the other side of the valley, the feianeh hills had bolder and more varied outlines than the southern ranges, of whose monotonous ridges of sandstone and shale our eyes had long been weary; but our hopes of something new in geological formations were disappointed, and the* only novelty was a welcome increase of vegetation. In an hour’s stroll after reaching the camp- mg-ground, a knoll near the path, a mile from the summit of the pass, I found asafoetida in abundance, maidenhair fern growing round springs in the gullies, wild pistachio, and the two most characteristic plants of the lower ranges of South Persia the broom-like wild almond, and a shrubby heath, which has a curious resemblance to a gooseberry bush covered with fruit.” _ The road descends from the top of the pass down a tributary of the Bun- sir Nala fora short distance, then turns to the east over an easy kutal to avoid a gorge in the above tributary, and descending joins the main Bunsir Nala here. At about 4 miles from the top of the kutal in this ndld is a halting-place called Daff-i- Afi. _ At 4| miles from this point the Bunsir Nala is joined by the Pork Nala which comes in from the south-south-west. Up this ndld one road runs to Dehak over the Brinjinan Pass, and another one following this same ndld for some distance at length diverges and runs over the Darpa-tMn Pass to Dizak. At 6f miles from Daff-i-Afi the Surkh Nak joins m from the west and from this point onwards the ndld is called the Kalaghan. — (St. John-, Jennings-) BUNSUR— A village in Bashakard, about 3| miles south-east of Ramishk, on the road to Fanuch.— (Sykes, 1898.) BUQ— Lat. 29° 4' 39'; Long. 61° 3' 0'; Elev. 3,296'. A halting-place in a ndld of the same name west of the Talab Hamun on the road from Jalk to Ladis. 154 miles from Jalk. It lies at the junc tion of the shorter desert route with this one. By the former, which goes through the desert skirting the hills, Buq is 126 miles from Jalk. Grass, grazing, wood fairly abundant. Water plentiful of excellent quality. The Buq ndld is a tributary of the Talab river, which itself a tributary of the Mashkid river. From the halting-place onwards up the ndld there is no water.

BURJA— A small circular fort in Persian Baluchistan, situated between Rigan and Na’Imabad, at a distance of 29 miles (by a very tortuous route) from the former and 10 miles from the latter. When Pottinger visited this place in 1810 he found a village within the fort of 50 or 60 houses. His account of the surrounding country is attractive, and from the snow-clad mountains visible to the westward, the number of running streams and the variety of trees, the scenery may well be, as he describes it, “ beautiful in the extreme.” Amongst the trees he noticed the pipal (Ficus religiosa), nlm (Melia azadirachta), babul (Mimaso arabica), and gaz (Indian tamarisk) besides the mango, walnut, and wild almond. He saw barley being cut in this neighbourhood in the end of April, and found the grain still more generally ripe at that early period as he advanced to the westward.— 2,600 (St. John) (Pottinger.)

Gulvarda is the most northern point of the Tag-i-Namadi : there are said to be customs sowars at this well under the Mirza of Avaz. The Afghans are said to graze right up to Gulvarda ; my informant, who was in the service of the farmer of customs before the Belgian ever came, told me that the Persian Customs sowars never ventured further east. A track from Gazik and Avaz to Anardarrah in Afghanistan crosses the Tag-i-Namadi a little to the south of Gulvarda. There is a well called Puzehjanga on this track.— {Keyes, 1904.)

Below the village is an extensive line of gardens, vineyards, and fields, watered by a most copious clear stream from a canal. The trees are chiefly jujubes and mulberry. Wheat and barley are cultivated in considerable quantity, and some beetroot, cotton and turnips are raised. The village contains about 200 families of Sunnis. The only manufacture is a sort of cotton cloth for [MacGregor.)n north-west of Gusht, in the Gad Pusht valley. The well is 30 feet deep and holds a very limited supply of saltish water ; fuel is scarce, but grazing plentiful. Perhaps the same as Buzin.— { Tighe , 1902.) BUZIN— Approx.

CHADDAR MULLA HAJI- . _ A broad ravine in Kirman, which leads up to the watershed of the Kuh- i-Khul (as that section of the Mukh-i-Surkh-i-Rud-i-Mahirange is called which lies between Gurg and Nasratabad-Sipi) and through which the cara van track from Bam to Sistan runs. The hills on each side of the ravine are low and irregular, and their sides are clothed with red and yellow flowers and strong smelling herbs. Some way up the ravine, where its breadth is about 100 yards, is a spring of fresh water called Kunaruh, Its waters are not perennial, and run dry in exceptional years. From this point the path rises steeply, and the gorge grows constantly narrower until it m only about 15 feet broad, while its sides glisten with fantastic colours, which appear to indicate the existence of some metals violet, yellow, and green predominating. About 1 mile above the Kum aruh spring the gorge forks, the easterly branch leading into the heart of the mountains, while up the westerly one runs the road to Nasratabad. At 21 miles from Kunaruh the pass grows still narrower, and is here called the Gudar-i-Surkhavak. At this point there is a small spring, and the gorge again bifurcates, the caravan route still leading alone the westernmost branch. 6 About 1 mile above this the watershed is”reached at an elevation of 4,775 feet. The descent on the north-eastern side of the range is by a narrow winding gorge similar to that just described. About § mile below the watershed is the Darvazeh-i-Nadir (Gate of Nadir), a narrow gap in a transverse ridge of rock not more than 9 feet wide, with traces of walls and rubble towers on each side, said to have been erected by order of* Nadir on his return from Hindustan. Three miles from the watershed the gorge, which increases gradually in width, is joined on the west side by a ravine in which are some tamarisk and date palms and a small spring of fresh water, called Ab-i-Kunji, said to be perennial. Beyond this point the gorge opens out on the eastern slopes of the mountains, at the foot of which lies Nasratabad-Sipi.—(Do&amp;&amp;s, 1902.) ei x. b. o114 CHA-CHA CHADDAR MULLA NASHID— Two cairns of stones in Persian Baluchistan, which are passed 15f miles south-south-east of Bazman, on the road to Bampur —(Tfood, 1899.)

Since the murder of Mr. Graves in 1897 a small detachment of Indian troops has been stationed here. Description. To'pogra'pky .—Chahbar Bay is a great bay or inlet, 7| m les broad at the entrance, by 10 miles in length. The shore on both sides is rocky, with cliffs' in places, to about 4 miles from the entrance, but the whole of the rest is low and swampy, and seldom seen from a ship. A range of mountains runs about ^ arallel with the coast, 8 miles inland from the head of the bay. A high quoin-shaped peak on these, 2,400 feet high, and bearing north from about the middle of the bay, is most con spicuous. Chahbar point is low and rocky, with sand hills, the coast to the eastward of it being of low cliff, and rising towards Kinj. The land rises close to the north of Chahbar village to a high tableland the south brow is 480 feet high, and is almost precipitous in places. On the north side of the little bay, in which the town lies, there are cliffs near the sea, from 1|- miles north of the village as far as Tiz point. A cliff of light colour, 210 feet high, forms the northern extremity of Chahbar anchorage. The cliff falls back north of this point, running eastward, on the south side of a great valley in the hills. On the north side of this valley are higher cliffs, which trend to eastward away from the sea, leaving the shore low and swampy. Town .—A ruined fort stands 300 yards from the shore, and around it lies the town. Close and to the south are some gardens with a few fruit trees and a few date palms, extending for | mile inland in a valley lying inside the coast hills. At a short distance to the north-east of the fort is a,large white tomb with a dome conspicuous from the sea. Close to the sea are116 CHA-CHA ■J f \ barracks, hospital, etc., for the accommodation of the British detachment. These buildings are seen across the land, when to the south-east of the place. Climate. —Fairly healthy, and comparatively cool for the greater part of the year ; no very trying heat as at Gwadar, Jask, and Bandar ’Abbas. Feverish in September and October. Heat is greatest in June and July. The rainy season lasts from December to February and heavy rain usually falls between these dates. Population. In 1906 there were 33 Khojas and 22 Banias’ shops, and about 300 Baluchi families residing in the place : to this must be added a sprinkling of negroes and others, making the total up to about 2,300 per sons, living in some 400 houses grouped round the ruined fort. About 400 unskilled labourers could be collected locally. Of these only about 100 are accustomed to working on vessels. The latter are for the most part British subjects from the coast of British Baluchistan. Wages 4 annas per diem. The language spoken is a Makran dialect of Baluchi, but Hindustani is generally understood. Persian is rarely heard, and is unintelligible to the majority of the people. Be sources. Water. —Plentiful and good from deep wells. It is pumped up into a reservoir, and laid on by pipes from one well to the telegraph quarters. The supply could be increased. Fuel. —Very scare ; would have to be imported. Fodder. —Camel grazing is abundant throughout the year. Grass is un obtainable. Fodder obtainable from the interior in large quantities. Supplies —Mutton, fowls, fish, eggs, wheat, barley, rice, ghi and dates. At times grain is scarce, but if timely notice be given, these can be procured in small quantities from the interior. About 500 sheep and goats are owned by the inhabitants. There are no cows. Fish in large quantities are netted in the bay. They are, however, generally coarse and not good eating. There are ooeoanut and mango trees, with gardens and general cultivation. Excellent stone suitable for building and road-making exists about 800 yards west of the telegraph buildings. Timber is scarce. Transport. —The camel is the only animal used for transport purposes. The Makran camel carries a load of 5 maunds and marches 15 miles a day at miles an hour. With a month’s notice 2,000 to 3,000 could probably be collected. Marching is usually done in the morning and afternoon, a halt beiag made in the day for grazing. Trade, imports. —Calico, cotton and woollen goods, silks, rice, flour, matches, tea, sugar, oil, spices, indigo, lead, iron, tobacco, beads, etc. The price of donkeys from Masqat varies from 2 to 50 rupees. Exports. —Cotton, wool, goats’ hair, dates, ghi, barley, skins, mats, salt, fish, isinglass, and sharks’ fins. The value of the exports amounts to about Rs. 1,50,000 annually, and tha t of the im p orts to about Rs . 1,00,000. *Customs—There is a brisk commercial stir here during the cold season goods being carried far into the interior to Geh, Bint, Fanuch, Qasrqand Bampur, Fahreh, etc. ^ Military. At Chahbar there is a detachment of one British officer and 50 men from the Indian battalion on the arms traffic blockade, with 2 maxim guns There are no Persian troops. The town could be made defensible on the land side. Harbour. Anchorage. The anchorage is exposed to the monsoon and in dangerous .during that season. An unlimited number of ships drawing up to 20 / could anchor in calm weather at a distance of about 2 miles from Chahbai beach. Good shelter from the monsoon exists to the north of Has Kuhlab (q.v.) where there is water deep enough for small ships, but during the monsoon there is a large swell even there, and ships roll heavily. Large ships must anchor more than a mile out, where they would be still more exposed. There is no bar at the entrance to Chahbar Bay, and it is passable with all winds. The five-fathom line is distant about two miles from Chahbar beach. The depth at the entrance of Chahbar bay is 8 fathoms, and decreases regularly to 6 fathoms off Tiz point, with muddy bottom. To the north ol this point a rocky bank extends off shore from 2 to 3 miles, having 2i to 1| fathoms on its edge and 4 to 5 outside ; it extends to the north for 4 or 5 miles. Has Kuhlab has 3 fathoms at J of a mile off, with 8 close out side, and the cliffs north of it are safe to approach up to a distance of | mile, but beyond them the west and north side of the bay are shoal, there being only 3 fathoms at nearly 2 miles off shore. The telegraph office at Chahbar is visible about 8 miles off ; the coast on both sides of the entrance is safe to approach, but is not easily seen at night, especially the two low entrance points, which are of light colour. There is a small minor bay off the main bay opposite Chahbar town. The south side of this little bay is shoal, with rocky bottom, for two cables off shore, from the Tumban point as far as a little rocky point with a small date clump near it, just outside the fort. Landing. Coast. The coast to the south of the promontory on which Chahbai is situated is rocky and consists of cliffs 10 to 50 feet in height. To the north of the promontory there is a sandy beach varying in breadth from 10 yards at Chahbar point to 200 yards opposite Chahbar village. The watei to the north of the promontory is shallow except for a distance of 800 yards ■opposite to the village, and here boats of 5 feet draught can approach to within 20 yards of the shore both at high and low tides. The best landing is near the date trees.*3g '£*=- 118 CHA-CHA CHAH DAR— ' A well in the Marz sub-division of Bashakard, situated to the south of the Manujan-Ramlshk road, 20 miles east-south-east of Tumgiran — {Sykes, 1898.) 6 CHAH DARAZ— « Name of a well on the road between Birjand and Nasratabad (Sistan).

Sykes, who was the first European to make the ascent (on Christmas eve, 1893), thus describes the climb : “ Leaving camp at Varaj, for 7 miles the track led up the valley, which then terminated in an extraordinary cleft in the rocks, called the Band-i-Gilu. From this point the climb began, the main difficulty being the steepness and the bitter cold, which latter we especially felt when plane-tabling on the summit, where we arrived about 2 p.m. We could see Sistan and the Gaud-i-Zireh to the north and north-east, while to the south and west the view appeared boundless. The descent was easy owing to the soft lava, and by 9 p.m. we reached our tents again. The valley was full of ruined forts;, opposite many of which was an oval chisel-wrought cavern, and as there were no marks of smoke inside them for a while I thought they might be a humble imitation of the tombs at Persepolis, but it seems more likely that they were the Chief’s granaries. The inhabitants said that they were excavat ed in the time of that Kudru Padshah, by which they may me&amp;n, Khusru, of the Indo‘Iranian epic. In any case this valley was evidently at some remote period an important centre, and it is a pity that there is„no mention made of the volcano by any of the earlier travellers.” Brazier-Creagh, who made the ascent on 31st December 1893 ; thus des cribes the mountain— “ TheChehil Tan or Taftan range} situated about the centre of the Sar- had plateau, has a south-south-west strike. It consists of four cone-shap ed peaks, the situations and approximate elevations of which are as follows :— (a) Madar Kuh (or Mother Hill) in the centre, an active volcano, 13,100 feet. From it rich sulphur and pure sal ammoniac are obtained. They form a part of the Sarhad revenue. There are two large volcanic holes from which smoke issues, and several other parasitic volcanoes are seen along the slopes of the cone. A strong odour of sulphur pervades the atmosphere for the last 1,000 feet from the top. (b) The Nair or Nar Kuh (or Male hill) to the west, and separated from the Madar Kuh by a narrow valley. (c) The Ziarat Kuh to the north, shadowing the Madar Kuh, and separated from it by a narrow valley. (d) The Subh Kuh (or Morning Hill). (None of these hills are of importance, and Madar-Kuh is only a volcano which is in the “solfatara” stage of its existence. Jennings is incorrect in speaking of it as an active triple peaked volcano.) The following is a list of some of the geological specimens obtained :— Sulphur. Compact limestone. Pumice stone. Sal ammoniac. Siliceous nummulitic limestone. Argillaceous limestone. Marls, reddish, ochre and khaki-coloured. One specimen of heavy saline dirty yellowish marl, called “zak” or mak” is used for dyeing purposes all over the country./ V CHE—CHI 137 taisttaas Smiles •rdinary e climl) whicli bre we to the geared 9 P.M. posite re no uioble t they eavat- lusra, some is no iSai' skp- ne as ilcano, ■form from ilong )here tiom 'cam) rrect The sides of the Kuh-i-Chehil Tan for the last 1,500 feet (which is very steep) are composed almost entirely of disintegrated pumice stone, with beds of sulphur : to this, and not to the snow, is due its conspicuously white appearance, which led Captain Jennings, Colonel Goldsmid, and others, who viewed this lofty landmark from afar, to fall into the error of stating it to be perennially snow-capped.— (Brazier-Creagh 1893 ; Sykes 1893—1902.)

It lies 60 miles north-west of Siroki on the Dasht, 51 miles south east of Qasrqand, and 20 miles north-west of Min Bazar. It consists of two villages, the North and South Churak, 2£ miles apart. Near South Churak the country is mostly plain, covered with a jungle of tama risk, ahir, and kandr trees, while north of North Churak the hills begin At both places there are a great number of huts, but not many occupants as (in 1900) they had mostly taken to the hills on account of official oppres sion. South Churak contained about 35 families of Jadgals and Baluchis and North Churak 20. Supplies, forage and fuel are abundant ; while good water is procurable from bands and wells. The climate is^ said to be healthy, the temperature in summer rising to 108° at noon, while the winter months are bracing and pleasant. Camels are available for hire at annas 12 to Re. 1 per diem. There is a .small stream of the same name which, rising near Sartab Dap, flows intn the Baku river.— {Janes, 1900.)CLA—CLA 140 CLARENCE STRAIT— This is the English and only general name of the passage between Qishm island and the coast of the mainland ; it is navigable for vessels, but a pilot is indispensable as it is very intricate besides being incompletely surveyed. The strait may be divided into three reaches. The first is from the east ern entrance between Qishm town and Bandar Abbas to Laft point which is exactly midway between Qishm town and Basidu ; it is 36 miles in length and it contracts from a width of 15 miles at the entrance to only 1 mile in the neighbourhood of Laft. The navigable channel, at its western end, called apparently Khur Masakeh, hugs the Qishm coast, and is for the greater part of the way very much narrower than the strait? The second reach begins at Laft point and continues to a little beyond the village of Guran, a distance, in a direct line, of 17 miles ; its direction is more southerly than that of the other two reaches. _ In this part the strait consists of two branches which separate at Laft point and reunite slightly below Guran; the western is Khur Masakeh, the eastern Khur Guran or Saiyid Ahmad. Khur Masakeh has a minimum depth in the fairway of 5 fathoms and does not narrow much below | mile, but the banks, which are steep, ars submerged and have nothing to mark their position, and this branch is consequently seldom used by pilots. Khur Guran is in places only Jmile wide, and its course is winding, but the banks are well- defined for most of the way by mangroves, and the minimum depth, like that &lt; f Khur Masakeh, is not less than 5 fathoms. The two Khurs are separated by a mangrove swamp intersected by creeks. Khur Masakeh gives access to the town of Khamlr near its right bank and Khur Guran to Laft village on Qishm island. The length of both Khurs is over 20 miles, that of Khur Guran being the greater by a few mile; The third and last reach of the strait, called Khur Ja’afari, reaches from the junction of Khur Masakeh and Guran to Basidu and is 19 miles in length. As Basidu is approached there is a mud flat extending along the shore of Qishm island, and also a shoal in mid«channel by the northern side of which ships pass. There is an anchorage off Laft point which is thoroughly well protected from all winds and would form a good harbour for the largest shij s the bottom is fine sand and shell, and appears to be good holding ground. The tidal stream here runs about 2 knots an hour at the springs. The land at Laft point slopes upwards to a height of _ 60 feet; on the main land opposite, the ground is low and quite flat for a distance inland of about 3 miles.DABANEH MUCHA— A village near Mahun {q.v.) in Kirman.

There are curiously shaped rocks near this, one of which is called Mil-i-Farhad.— (Goldsmid; Euan-Smith.) DAG-I-YANUS or SHAHR-I-JlRUFT— A ruined city in Kirman situated on the west bank of the Halil Rud nearly opposite Dasht-i-Kush, miles north of the village of Malikabad. Major Sykes has no hesitation in identifying it with the Camadi of Marco Polo’s travels, who, in describing his journey from Kirman, writes thus— “ After you have ridden down hill these two days, you find yourself in a vast plain, and at the beginning thereof is a city called Camadi, which formerly was a great and noble place but is now of little consequence, for the Tartars in their incursions have several times ravished it. The plain whereof I speak is a very hot region, and the province that we now enter is called Reobarles.” The following account is taken from Major Sykes’ “Ten Thousand Miles in Persia ” :— “ In 1894, and again in 1900, I spent a couple of days on the site of the city of Jiruft, of which Komadin (Camadi) was a quarter, occupying a huge area on the right bank of the Halil Rud. The ruins consist of millions of kiln-burnt bricks, eight inches square, and the surface is littered with frag ments of pottery. I was shown what was evidently the fort,' as the ditch was distinctly traceable ; it was square, each side measuring 286 yards. There are some underground chambers which would repay excavation ; there are no lustred tiles, nor could I find a cemetery. A legend runs to the effect that the city of Jiruft was destroyed by a flood, and this is probable, as not a wall is standing, which would hardly be the case if the city had been sacked and deserted. It is now, in common with other ruins in Persia, known as the Shahr-i-Dugianus, or city of Decius—the Roman Emperor with whom the story of the seven sleepers of Ephesus is connected. “In the history of the Seljuks of Kirman by Muhammad Ibrahim we read that ‘Komadin was a suburb at the gate of Jiruft, a resort of strangers from Turkey and Hind, and a meeting place of travellers by sea and land, the treasury of the wealthy and the store-house of the east and west. ’* In 1170, just a century before Marco Polo’s journey, it was looted for the first time by Bahram Shah, one of the Seljuk princes. “ A few years later it was again raided, but had apparently recovered, as it is described as ‘ the abode of men from every quarter, and the store house of the valuables of China, and Cathay and Hindustan, Abyssinia and Zanzibar, Turkey, Egypt, Armenia, Fars and Irak.’ This description is of great interest, not only as vindicating the accuracy of the great Venetian, but as showing how widely traders travelled at that period. The Ghazz completed the ruin of Camadi, and when Marco passed through it it was as he remarked, ‘ of little consequence. 5 ”DAG—DAL 143 DAHAK— Elev. 5,325'. _ The 3rd stage on the Robat-Bampur route.

From the top of a hill, J mile from camp at mile 89, bearing to camp 68°, it can be seen that the road, on wards to the watershed, runs along the south-western slopes of the high hills (called “ Daman-i-Bazman ” generally, i.e., “ Skirts of Bazman,” although each bit of the range possesses a local name from the name of the perennial water it contains, e.g., Kuh-i-Taftab, Kuh-i-Rang, Kuh-i-Maksan, Kuh-i- Dar-i-Ahu, Kuh-i-Dar-i-Duzab, etc.) over red sandstone, volcanic formations, and a black rock ; much iron ore in it. Road to watershed ascends and descends alternately. To the left (south-west) a broad valley can be seen draining to the Milan-i-Jihun. The range to the north-west is known by the different names of the Kuh-i-Qurban, Kuh-i-Suza, Kuh-i-Saif-ud-Din, and's a continuation of the range already mentioned as the Daman-i-Baz man.

Could easily be made passable for guns.—(Jenmn^s, 1885.)The river of this name crosses the route at mile 16|, and is merely a dry river-bed. At the point where it passes the new Padaha post (locallv known as Kaleh Safid)andthe MIrjawa cultivation, it is a most insigni ficant dry sandy nald only, some 20 yards wide, and about 2 feet deep Local evidence is unanimous in proving that the Dar-i-Blaban does not begin to be called the Talab until it passes the Kuh-i-Rihl and reaches according to some authorities, the junction of the Rlhi Nala, 28 miles below Kaleh Safid, and according to others, the Talab spring 41 miles below Kaleh $3lM—(M cMahon, May 1905.)

The road onwards runs up the middle one. Supplies nil. Grass, wood, grazing abundant, and a perennial flowing stream, the water of which, however, is rather brackish. These ndlds drain into the Milan-i-Jihun Hdmun. — (Jennings, 1882.) DAR-I-MAZAR— Elev. 7,700'. A village in Kirman, 26J miles from Rabur, on the road to Rayin. Although the chief village of the Sarduieh district, it consists of very few150 DAR—DAR houses and owes whatever importance it possesses to a well endowed shrine, dedicated to Sultan Saiyid Ahmad Saghir, son of the Saiyid Kabir, a son of the Imam Musa. Saiyid Kabir was said to have been the first preacher of Muhammadanism in India ; where he died a martyr’s death.

DASHKIRDISH— A village in Rudbar {q.v.) in Kirman. DASHT— A name _ given the coast districts of Persian Baluchistan south of Geh and Bint. They are understood to be Kair and Blr, east of the Ranch river, and Karvan and Surag to the west of the same. The whole is also called qibleh, a term referring to the westerly position of this tract with reference to the rest of Makran. The district is not mentioned by Lofimer. In the time of Hap ’Abdul Nabi the Dasht was dependent on Geh and the Bulidi chief of that place drew the following revenue from it : Kai van .. ,. .. .. 40 Sitarami ducats. Ba ak . „ .. ■ . # Surag .. .. ...” 40 Fishermen of the Rapcli river .. ..40 ” ” ... Total .. 160 ducats which at Rs. a ducat would amount to Rs. 880. 61 I. B. T154 DAS-DAS i This revenue was levied on the cultivable land, the crops of which are almost entirely dependent on rain. Besides this, the people were accustomed to send 70 camels yearly as “ sedawiawa ” or present. The Dasht posts were under the supervision of the chief of Bint, and paid yearly through him as under :— Sadaich Dil Muhammad Singala .. .. 14 ducats.

S ,t Tiz .. • • 15 »» Chahbar (port only) •• .. 40 Total .. 227 ducats or Rs. 1,248-8-0. The length of the Dasht districts may he nearly 100 miles and the &gt; breadth about 20 miles. On the south is the sea and on the north the hill ranges which separate this low strip of country from the somewhat more elevated interior. The Sadaich is the boundary to the west, and the Chahbar district to the east—unless indeed Chahbar is included in the Dasht, which seems probable. The greater part of the tract consists of sandy plains, becoming gravelly or stony towards the hills and rising into sand-dunes along the coast. They are sprinkled with low scrub and bushes similar to those found all along the coast, and in Sind. Occasionally, near watercourses, a few small trees may be found, and there are palm groves on some of the larger streams. There are also hills on or near the seaboard, forming somewhat bold headlands in places, but these are all disconnected from each other, flat sandy beaches and stretches of coast intervening. Tracts of shur hills occur in places. The ports mentioned above are hamlets of fishermen, and not one of them offers a good landing place.* Indeed, from the shallowness of the sea and multiplicity of sand banks, only the smallest native craft venture at all near the land. In the plain there are no villages or hamlets, except a few on the larger watercourses near the hills (as Karvan ?), but movable groups of mat huts are met with here and there. These are, in fact, camps, and are shifted from place to place wherever the best grazing for the camels and sheep is to be found. A number of watercourses from the hills force a varying course through the sand to the sea. Some of these coming from the interior rise to the dignity of rivers in this dry country. The principal of these are the Kir or Kair, the Bapch, and the Sadaich. The Rapch is perennial, every other water-course dries up in summer, but in the Kair and Saaaich, and perhaps in others, pools of water may always be found. The beds of the rivers are wide and the bottoms soft and muddy. In the cold weather after heavy rain they rise to a great height, flooding the country for some distance on either hand. It is then impossible to cross for some days. {See also under the names of rivers.) i hi f f f h] Vi Ku Ja’The people of the country, known collectively as Dashtls, are mostly ±&gt;alucn. Ihe Hot tribe is probably the most numerous. They breed camels sheep and goats, and also pay some little attention to agriculture, but the country is not one which encourages the husbandman They possess all the Baluch virtues and defects. Haji ’Abdul Nabi speaks highly of their hospitality and honesty. The fishermen are of inferior race: The climate of these coast districts is unbearably hot in summer. In winter, from October to March, it is not unpleasant, and, though the ther mometer in the shade rises to 90° in the middle of the day, the nights are quite cool. Rain may be expected after September, but rarely falls in any quantities till December. Occasionally there is rain in July and August but not often. The total yearly rainfall is very small. The land line of the Indo-European telegraph runs through the district, and is accompanied, though sometimes not very closely, by a road or track' In December, January, and February travelling is not difficult. Water is then found pretty frequently. Camel-grazing is abundant and there is some little grass. Supplies, however, except mutton from the flocks of sheep and goats which feed over the country at this season, are not to be had. Fuel is also scanty. After rain camels cannot travel for two or three days, and any of the larger streams may delay travellers for some time.—(tfan 'Abdul Nabi • Floyer ; Pierce) * DASHT AB— Elev. about 6,600'. .

This Jcutal is on the main Bam-Khanu road, across the Jamal Bariz or Jabal Bariz range. St. John mentions it as follows :— “ Here (the caravanserai of Khan-i-Kaatun, a couple of miles north-east of the village of T Lrud) the eastern road from Kirman to Banda ' Ab as branches off from the Bam road. This route, travelled throughout by Major Murdoch Smith in 1866 and partially by Mr. Keith Abbott before him, and Sir Frederick Goldsm d afterwards P leads through Sarvistan and the Deh Bakri Pass over the Jamal Bariz range to the plain of Jiruft.” This pass is said to be practicable at all times, and has frequently been traversed by wheeled artillery. Goldsmid, in his route Bandar Abbas to Bam, describes this pass as follows:— , ... “ We had passed early m the day the village of Dasht-i-Khushk, which, as its name implies, marks the limit of cultivation on this side of Deh Ba m, and coming upon the stony barren slope of the mountain range, had continued our ascent .or 10 miles, when we found ourselves at the entrance of the pass, from whence a very fine view of the Jiruft and Rudbar plains is obtained. Our path then followed the course of a mountain torrent between rocky cliffs, till we commenced the very difficult ascent known as the G. dar-i-Sakhtdar.* The summit of this pass, which is 38 miles from Du ari, we reached with difficulty, and passing through a winding valley came into the open plain of Sakhtdar with the Rud Khaneh flowing through it. . - The desolate caravanserai of Maskun is situated in a hollow on the highest’ part of the pass, 7,300 feet above sea-level. . • • We found that 2 miles beyond the caravanserai thz vo&amp;d makes another steep ascent the extreme summit of the pass of Deh Baku, for which the aneroid registered a height of 7 800 feet. Descending by a steep and slippery path, we reached a mile further on the caravanserai of Deh Bakri, which closely resembled that of Maskun, and bad evidently been built thus near it to afford shelter to travellers on either side ot this dangerous pass in severe weather.” Deh Bakri valley is about § mile broad and 2 miles long; surrounded by low alluvial and gravelly hills. The soil is good, and well-watered by numerous rivulets running down from the west to join the Deh Bakri Bud. A few orchard6 are scattered throughout the valley, which contains two old cemeteries. This valley, in which the site of the classical Carniana, the most ancient capital of the province, is supposed to lie, was much more thickly inhabit ed in past years and shows signs of having been more care fully cultivated. It is now but sparsely inhabited and indifferently * Gudar-i-Saqdir.DEH—DEH 165 cultivated. There are some 30 huts scattered under the hills. Deh -Bakn is owned by the Khans of Bam.

This is the same as the “ Kuhistani ” river. DEHGVAR— A place,_ or rather a tract of country, in the Jalk district of Persian Baluchistan. It is said to be a long strip of marshy ground covered by immense date groves, and situated some 20 to 25 miles north-east of Jalk Gulugar on the Rajah branch of. the Mashkid (q.v.) is understood to be about the same distance north-east of Dehgvar. From information gathered by St. John when at Jalk in 1872, he understood the marsh to be caused by the drainage from the hills—Siahan Kuh, etc—flowing under the gravelly glacis which here, as in many other places, stretches a long distance from*the base of the ranges, and is known as the ddman-i-kuh, or skirts of the mountains. Macgregor, however was informed (1877), that a stream or watercourse, draining Lddis, entered Dehgvar from the west-north-west. Ladis (q.v.) is a district on the Sarhad plateau. It is quite possible that its water comes down here and contributes to form, or is the principal agent in creating, the marshy tract in which the date groves flourish. Between Dehgvar and the Mashkid to within a short distance of Gulugar on the north-west, and right up to the river-bed further south, the country is entirely covered with high ridges of heavy sand. There can be little doubt that the reason why the drainage from the hills accumulates at Dehgvar instead of running off to the Mashkid is on account of the sand intervening. Many examples of drainage thus intercepted may be found round the edges of the Kharan and Shorawak deserts. To the south or south-east of Dehgvar, and in the same line, are similar, but smaller, date groves. The first of these, Ladgasht (q.v.), appears to be some way off, but from that place to Askan, a distance of 10 to 15 miles, the date groves seem to be pretty numerous, though not so thick as those of Dehgvar. The whole of these outlying date groves appear to be in the country ofthe Reid Baluch, who acknowledge Dilayar Khan, of Dizak, and the Persian Government. TVip Ipnp'th of Dshgvar, conjectured to be from north-west to south-east, may be 15 miles or even more. Its breadth is probably not great. Formerly there were villages here and also at the other date groves, Lad- „aaht Kalacr and Askan; but there are now no permanent inhabitants at any of these places, nor is there any cultivation other than that of the date-tree which in such places requires but little care. This desolation is caused by the insecurity of the country arising from the constant petty warfare between the Riki Baluch and people of Jalk, and the ISaushir- vanisand others of Kharan, as well as raids of Sarhadi and Sistam Baluch whom the Rikls are not strong enough to withstand._ ihe groves ’ of Dehgvar are the property of various tribes, Pan]guns and Khlranis as well as inhabitants of Jalk and Kalaghan The proprietors visit the place but twice a year, once when the female blossom requires fertilization by the pollen of the male and again when the date harvest has to be gathered. At other times the groves are void of human i e, except when temporarily occupied by plundering parties, y 0 fin them well-adapted for concealment and rest before making the final descent on their prey. It is probable that there is ordinarily but little surface water at Dehgvar, and that it is by no means wholesome, but it could always he obtained by digging, and there are said to be wells of good water at Askan and Ladgasht, and at a place called Maksotag, which must be m or close to the Dehgvar date groves. Firewood and camel forage are also procurable at these places. Although St. John and Blanford were at Jalk in 1872, and Macgregor and Lockwood travelled down the Mashkil in 1877, none of them were able to visit Dehgvar, or the similar groves to the south-east. However, General Gasteiger Khan, an Austrian officer m ' visited Jalk in 1881, and went to a place he calls Mashked whia1 ' almost certainly Dehgvar, though it is just possible it might have been I 5rl£y5&lt;Jit He calls it “ the furthest eastern boundary of Persia. tSteker? ourney was connected with the defence of the frontier. He inspected the forts, planned alterations, and m some instances new works, none of which, however, appear to have been carried out. His account is as follows : .. After a w march of 10 miles, we arrived at last at Mashked, which is situated in lualm forest 4 miles long, without the least sign of human habitation. Her e eo - mence the endless sand stenpes, where every sign of the road is obhtera ed, an on y the most skilful can find their way by particular signs. Gasteiger’s miles would naturally be German miles (5| English miles) , but he seems to consider the Persian farsafch, which is about 3 j English miles as equivalent to a mile. Even at this calculation his distances_are Sways exaggerated. It is certain that neither Dehgvar nor Ladgasht are anything like 37* miles from Jalk. The length of the forest, how ever which he must have got from information obtained on the spot, perhaps correctly stated at 4 farsahhs or 15 English miles.But to continue :— “ Exhausted by the fatiguing ride, I stretched myself under a palm tree and waited patiently for the arrival of the tents. The troublesome wind drove the sand into our eyes, until it began to rain, which was very refreshing. “ These palm forests are the property of scattered Baluchis, and are now the gather ing point of Azad Khan’s ruffians, who rob on their own account and then run away. At this place the ground is hardly firm yet over the graves of twenty-one persons who died in defence of their homestead last autumn. “There are three ruined fortifications here. One which was built by Azad Khan with walls, ditch, and towers is the best. There are also a few cultivated fields, which are irrigated by two dilapidated canals. The objections to building a fort here are the constant whirlwinds, the bad water in the wells, the most unhealthy climate, and above all the complete isolation of the place, it being 10 miles from any village. In consequence of all these drawbacks, I thought it would be better to build a fort at Jalk than at Mashked. “ As the whole day was occupied in exploring the ground, and we intended to start on our return trip by full moonlight that night, every one sought his bed early ; but the wind which blew like a hurricane, blew all our tents down, so that I had to be in the open air exposed to the moonlight, and was gradually covered with sand. “ To prevent accidents, I gave orders that all fires should be extinguished. About one hour before midnight there was a sudden alarm. Partly aroused from sleep, I looked for my revolver, which was covered with sand, and rushed after the people, thinking it was a surprise ; but soon I heard the word kefler (hyena), and understood what had caused the alarm.” Besides being on the road to Galugan (from whence there are roads to Chagai, Nushki and Kharan, as well as north to Rudbar, etc., on the Hel- mand), Dehgvar is on or close to the direct road from Panjgur to Sistan,* which passes through Askan and Ladgasht to Maskotag, men tioned above. That place is reckoned the ninth stage from Panjgur, 15 or 20 miles north-west of Ladgasht, and 10 or 12 miles from Gaz (q.v.), the next stage towards Sistan.'— (St. John ; Macgregor ; Gasteiger.)

Its general elevation is about 4,000 feet. . , It contains numerous villages, of which the following may be noted Hushak, Bukhshan, Shastan, Sarju, Dilavar Khan, Qadir Bakhsh, Muham- madi Aspich and Ziarat. All of them possess forts, with extensive date groves and cultivation, while the village of Dilavar Khan (q-v.) is e residence of the Sardar of Dizak. Supplies in fair quantities are always procurable, while its cotton is famous throughout Baluchistan, beingexported as far as Bint. In 1839 there were said to be 1,000 weavers settled in the district, but it is not known if this is still the case. The climate is considered good, and it shares with Sib and Magas a reputation for healthiness and fertility unrivalled in Persian Baluchistan. The principal routes leading from Dizak are— (a) to Sib, via the Sarandar pass; (b) to Vasht, up the Simish valley; (c) to Jalk, via the Brijnan pass; (d) to Kuhak, via Isfandak. The inhabitants of the Dizak villages, as of Sib, Jalk, etc., are mostly Arbabis (q.v.), a short, sturdy, ugly, but good-humoured and industrious race, believed by St. John to be akin to the Dehwars of the Brahui high land, and therefore to the Tajiks of Afghanistan and Sarts of Central Asia. They are admirable cultivators. Of course the important part of the population, if not the most numerous, are Baluch of various tribes. They own large flocks of sheep and goats and pasture over the hills and unculti vated portions of the country. The chief’s family is of Barakzai Afghan descent, and state that they emigrated a good many generations ago from the Helmand valley—perhaps they brought the original Arbabis with them.

It was reduced in 1734 by Nadir Shah, and with the rest of Baluchistan formed part of the possessions of that conqueror. When in the zenith of his power Nadir Shah bestow_ed Dizak on an ancestor of the present chief. On the death of Nadir Shah in 1747, Nasir Khan of Kalat became the independent ruler of all Baluchistan. He appears to have confirmed Nadir Shah’s grant, bestowing Dizak on Niamatuliah whose name seems to be still well known in the country. _ Nasir Khan died in 1795 so that the Niamatullah, who was chief at the time of Pottinger s visit in’1810, may have been the same as he who received the Irom Nasir Khan Haji ’Abdul Nabi visited Dizak m 1839, and relates that at that time the chief was Mir Gajian, who was very popular m the district. His retainers were Damani Baluch (q.v.), a tribe which appears to be numerous in the whole tract south of Sarhad, from Dizak to Magas. Mir Gaiian claimed descent from Shah Niamatullah-i-Yali, a famous saiyid to whom a shrine is dedicated at Mahun. In the meantime the Persians had again been asserting a right to Dizak (with the rest of Western Baluchis- tin), and during the reign of Path ’Ali Shah (1797 to 1834) the country was invaded by the Vazir Mirza ’Abdul Qasim, and a great part of it was temporarily annexed to the Persian dominions. The effect on Dizak was the levy of a tax of Rs. 5 on every hangam, or full water right. Nasir Khan II of Kalat (1841 to 1857) made vigorous and by no means unsuccessful efforts to reassert authority over the territory adjacent to Persia, which had fallen away during the feeble rule of his pre- Whether he ever got much hold on Dizak is uncertain ; but as Gold- smid says, “ these petty Baluch states, instead of uniting under one recog nized head, had no common bond of interest to keep them together, and became the prey of their most powerful neighbour for the time being whether Persia; Afghanistan, or a Baluch Sardar of superior power and ab From the time of the annexation of Bampur in 1844-45, Persia was in a position to enforce her pretensions to Dizak and the neighbourmg country, although her only solid title was the right of the strongest Go - smid about 1863 reported Dizak to be m Persian possession, although according to St. Jolm, it was not brought thoroughly under ^ct' 1865-66, when Ibrahim Khan, the Governor of Bampur, reduced th chiefs to submission, freeing them at the same time ^ their enemies, the Kharan Naushirvams. Goldsmid says that the chief, was Alim Khan, who had been to Tehran and there received ^ grant of district in due form. The same authority says that Ahm Kh.m was a grandson of Niamatullah, from which it would appear that D^zak chiefs had enjoyed unusual longevity for ^re^generatmns^ But LS Qli - either a day or a night m each week*St. joiin in connection with Sir F. Goldsmid’s Boundary Commission. Dilavar Khan was then the chief. Dilavar is described as a dull, heavy-looking man of forty. As before said, he is of Barakzai Afghan des cent. Jalk being his personal appanage, he would appear to be the re presentative of the ruling family of that district (see Jalk) and not a descendant of Niamatullah. Nine years later (1881) General Gasteiger, an Austrian officer in the Persian service, met Dilavar Khan, whom he calls a man of noble and venerable appearance, at Jalk (q.v.). As some consolation for his loss of independence, he had received the title of Colonel from the Shah, and a sword of honour. But no doubt his allegiance to the Persians, like that of all the Baluch chiefs, was compulsory, and he appears to have treated Gasteiger with a want of courtesy, which made the latter very angry. There seems to have been fighting between Azad Khan of Kharan, and the Persians during the intervening period. No doubt the former, who had planted his foot pretty firmly at Kuhak (q.v.), considerably annoyed Dilavar Khan and the people of Dizak and Jalk. According to Gasteiger, Azad Khan drove Dilavar from his place, and raided the country as far as Bampur. Ibrahim Khan, however, marched against him with a force, and defeated him on the Mashkil, at a spot where he had built a fort, pro bably Gulugan. However, Gasteiger’s statements are so wild that no reliance can be placed on what he says, and St. John distinctly states that Ibrahim Khan defeated Azad Khan six years before his own visit, that is, in 1866, capturing and destroying a fort which Azad Khan had built on the Mashkil, two marches east of Jalk (q.v.), so, perhaps, it is this event to which Gasteiger alludes. However, the fact remains that up to the present time there has been a constant feud between the Persian authorities and the Baluchis, and that the former can only collect their revenue by force of arms. Up till 1892, the Dizak area was controlled by the deputy gover nor of Bampur, through Dilavar Khan, who was acknowledged the prim cipal Baluch Sardar, and through whom all taxes were collected. Dilavar Khan died in 1892, and was succeeded by his eldest son Mif ’Abdullah ; from this date the undivided authority of the Buzurgzadehs declined. Owing to the utter state of lawlessness prevailing in 1901, and the powerlessness of the Persians to prevent raiding into British territory a small expedition, under Major Tighe, in co-operation with Persian troops, was, in 1902, despatched to this part of the country in order to inflict punish- ment on the offending villages. Among other places, Dizak was visited, Irafshan taken and the forts of Ashar, Afshan, Magas, and many others blown up and Persian authority firmly established, for the time being, over these border districts. Hogg states that there are now (1909) four claimants to the Sardarship of the Baluch tribes, in the Dizak area, viz., Shahbaz Khan, Buzurgzadeh, the rightful claimant; MadadKhan, Buzurgzadeh, his uncle ; ’All Muham mad, Baranzi, and Mir Ghulam Rasul, Mir Muradzai.— (Goldsmid, 1871 \ St. John, 1872] Sykes, 1902] Tighe, 1902] Hogg, 1909.)

In a northerly direction, it ex tends to and includes the hamlets of Kahtak and Khushab. The other two nawats are : Julgah-i-Sunni Khaneh and Zirkuh. • Very little ^ known of even the recent history of Duruh. A sanad issued in he reign of Shah Abbas shows that the hereditary Jcat-lchudd of the place at that time was one Mulla ’Ali Shah. The Akhund family of Duruh and the Duruh people known as “ Mulla ’All’s ” both claim this individual as their ancestor. The present Naib’s family is sprung from the Khoia brothers who are said to have come from Bokhara during Shah Sufi’s reign. It is not known at what time the family obtained the chiefshm of Duruh, but it is believed that till about Mir Asadulla’s time, on account of kS£ C0nneCtl0n Witl1 the KUns of Sunm-Khaneh they were independent f Tlie Duruhis say they became Shi’ahs 300 years ago. •^ 1 !i ba v tl i e about 1263 H.

The revenue is about Tumdns 850 (included from old time and m the Mustansir-ul-Mulk’s settlement in the Jama of Sunni-Khaneh). The people of Duruhare exempted from the payment of full tax or san, and are in consequence liable for militia service, lashkar Jcashi. There is a customs house at Duruh subordinate to that at Ahwaz. The present Mirza is ’All Akbar, who was transferred here in connection with a case of extortion from Afghans. . The authorized route across the frontier is thus described by the Customs Department “ From Kandahar and Farreh to Birjand by Damdam (Afghan) by Chah-i-Sagak, Chashmeh-i-Shataran, Duruh. . . The only kdriz or cultivated land in this part of the frontier which migh conceivably be held to come within the disputed area (though the Afghans have so far made no claim or taken other action with regard to it), is that of Asparan. The ruins at this place testify to its having once been a big place, but no one that I have spoken to has been able to afford any clue^s to when and why it was abandoned. The reason put forward for the abandonment of other big villages of this strip of frontier is the^Tur m- man raids, and it is possible that Asparan should be included m the same The history of the recent cultivation of Asparan is as follows . Some 8 or 10 years ago one ’AH and his father Muhammad, Afghan refugees (anXnSd roVrs)' cultivated a Uttle land Asparan w« in company with a man of Duruh named Akbar (a Mulla A1). Tksoid his shar 0 °f the Tcdnz to Kat-Uudd Ha,mza and’All Murad (Turn) of Sistan for Jcrans 400 some 7 years ago. The latter worked the S _or some months with Ah and then, having a dispute with him, abandoned In im Said Khan (Mamaseni), employed by the Sistan Consulate as Levy Jamadar, petitioned the Shaukat-ul-Mulk for the grant to him o the Asparan Jcanz. As 5 Ah was paying no revenue, the Governor agreed to the grant on the condition of Said Khan maintaining there a poft of Baluch to guard the frontier. Asparan, it should be noted, is situated on the direct route from Sistan to Kain that passes through a corner of Juwam to the north of the Hamun-i-Sabari and robberies were frequent. N i T 3 / 1 th * 8 gr 1 a : nt w . as .“ iade ’ objection was raised by the Salaris of eh, the old ruling family of this baluJc, on the ground that they held documents (Mahr-namas) proving them to be the owners of Asparan as we as of Surtigh, Khoja do Chahi and other Jcdrlzes in the Duruh-hamun district. 1 heir claim as regards Asparan seems to have been accepted as they executed a deed making over their rights to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk as pish /cash There were other points regarding the Neh revenue settled at the same time. The man ’AH, who had been evicted, was given in exchange another property in the Duruh district called Mahrud and tie executed a formal agreement accepting the exchange. Kat-lchudd amza and Ah Murad do not seem to have put in a claim. Khoja Jan Muhammad of Duruh raised an objection to Asparan being given to Said Khan, as he claimed Asparan as his private property. His claim was rejected as he could bring forward no evidence, while the Salaris’ claim had been held to be good. When M. Miller was Russian Consul in Sistan, it is said that he made endeavours to purchase Asparan from the Naib of Duruh. Jan Muham mad had at that time been temporarily deprived of the Naibship and owing to that it is said negotiations fell through. T ^ ell U ng - t ^ t0 As P aran are &gt; it; ma 7 be mentioned, altogether denied by the Duruhis, especially those known as Mulla ’AHs. This community sa y the 7 are Baluch that came fromHamadan in ancient times. The head of the community, Bahran, showed me a sanad of Shah Abbas Saffavi confirming one Mulla ’AliShahin the Kat-khudaship of Duruh, with which he contends the other hamlets are included. He also holds another sanad to the same effect, alleged to be from Fatteh ’AH Shah—but of this the seal has been torn off. The right of Mulla ’AH to this sanad is not uncontested. The Akhund family of Duruh state that the Mulla’Ali Shah to whom the Shah Abbas’ sanad was addressed was an ancestor of theirs and that they (Mulla ’AHs) stole it from them. In the present year, Said Khan’s title has been confirmed by the Hissam-ud-Dauleh. Tlieie are two hdrizes now open at Asparan, the produce being about 20 Tabriz kharwdrs of wheat. According to the Naib of Duruh and all others addressed on the subject, t re old political frontier was the Harut Rud. Force of circumstances has caused the abandonment of this line by the Persians, and the Kuh-i- Atashkhaneh is now considered the frontier*184 DUR—DUR I! ii U; Until the country between the Kuh-i-Atashkhaneh and the terminal pillar of the Sistan boundary crimes to be surveyed it is difiicult to say where a line joining these points would fall as regards Asparan. I* clear, however, that so far as. our personal knowledge goes, the latter nlaop must be considered Persian. , . , .. 1 A fairly reliable authority has stated that Chah Beg is m Persian limits and Sherak-i-Shah Beg on the Asparan-SIstan road on ^e frontier As regards grazing rights, the information given by Captain Aeyes his note of 1st May 1906 has been generally corroborated by other m or* Plants. Where rights are undefined, however, as they are m the present case, exact agreement in details cannot be expected. ,, tj f According to informants, even in old days when the Harut was considered the frontier, Afghan mdlddrs had prescriptive grazing rights beyond this to the west. At the present time Afghan maldars have until recently grazed their flocks up to the following points:— Surtigh 8 Hangur and Halted Rud (Lahnu), Chah Sagak ; Chah Surkh Khargas ’All, Chah Shar. # . Kt - From reports that have been received, however, it seems tha,t of late Afghan mdlddrs have been discouraged grazing their flocks on the ^ eri ? ian ^ of the recognised frontier and in some cases have been turned back by the cUunl sowars. This country is also grazed over by the Sistan maldars. The latter do not seem to enjoy any reciprocal rights as regards grazing on the Afghan side. Numerous cases, have recently been reported ot Afghans having warned the Sistan mdlddrs back from transgressing the imaginary frontier, and fined them for doing so. As already mentioned, there is a highway from Sistan to Duruh that passes through Afghan territory north of the Haimim The Afghan, levy a TcdfUeh-bdshi fee on Persian traders and others using this road. In Cctober 1908 a case occurred in which one Mir Husain Sultan, Arab (a servant of the Governor of Kain) was proceeding towards Kain by this road when he was held up by Afghan chauni sowars at Shorak-i-Shah Beg and certain property was confiscated in lieu of tazkara fees. , i i j. Another caravan was similarly held up at the same- time and close to the same spot. The Persian Foreign Minister brought the matter to the notice of the British Legation, apparently alleging that the Afghan sowars had come 40 miles within Persian territory. As a matter, of fact the point Shorak-i-Shah Beg is just about close where the frontier line would run. The Afghans do not seem to take any grazing tax from maldars passing through Afghan territory from Sistan to Kain, but a tax only (possib y unauthorized) of a sheep and krdns 2 to 4 per rama (fl° ck ); An old shikari, whose report may be considered unbiased, stated tha the Atashkhaneh range was the recognised frontier of Duruh. As regards grazing taxes, he corroborated the Naib’s statement as given above . North of the Kuh -i-Atashkhaneh, Chah Khargosh is recognised to be m Duruh limits, while Damdam and the Dak-i-Tundi are on the frontier line. The Afghan chaunls on this section of the frontier are Chashmeh Khash.—Situated, as far as can be gathered,_some 8 miles west to Kala Kah (Sher-i-Kuh). The sowars from this ckauni patrol as tar to the west as Shorak-i-Sfrah Beg,Tundi.—Situated to the east of Kuh-i-Tundl.

A village of about 500 houses and some 2,100 inhabitants, in the Kaln distnet of Khorasan, on the road from Birjand to Sistan, and 86 miles south- east of the former town. It is situated on the eastern limit of the plains and at the western base of a range of hills forming the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan. From Duruh the plains extend 12 miles west 9 miles north, and 20 miles south. The roofs of the houses are made of wooden rafters and are not domed like the roofs of the Sistani houses. Ike hill which more particularly overlooks the village is crowned by a ve.ry old and ruined fort, which is said to date from the time of the first -teaiam kings. Duruh is irrigated by six springs of excellent, and three karizes of brackish, water : it also possesses a water-mill and five wind mills. There are a number of walled gardens, containing mostly mulberry pomegranate and almond trees. In ordinary years the village does not grow sufficient gram for its own use, but in years of good rainfall the pro em caon of wheat and barley on bdrdni land is said to amount to 1 000 kharwars. T wo hundred Indian maunds of bhusd, might be obtainable. The people live principally on turnips. At the beginning of 1908 there were in the village 6 horses, 5,000 goats and sheep, 300 donkeys and 200 head of cattle. There is a Customs official stationed in the village for the trade between Afgnanistan and the Kainat, and 10 sarbdzes under a vakil with 6 martini rifles. The Duruh valley is a favourite pasture ground of the Iliats of the Fain district and their black tents are scattered all over the valley, but mostly aiong the hill-skirts, where water is generally found. Their flocks of goats ana sheep are very numerous, but not so camels and horned cattle. Their goats are of a small breed and mostly black, and shed a soft downy hair called kwh This is collected, picked and sorted for the manufacture of soft felt, clothes and shawls, according to quality.

The principal village in the Jiruft district of Kirman, situated 314 miles from Bijnabad, on the road to Kirman. It stands on the open plain, some 400 yards from the Kuh-i-Dusarl, a jagged limestone range of hills running east and west, and separating it from .the lofty Jabal Bam range, and, though formerly a large village, now consists only of a small fort, a, water mill, and afew mud huts surrounded by a wall. The roofs are domed. There is a caravanserai and in 1908 there were five shops. In the winter months, many more people come to live in the place from other parts of the country. One of the houses is in the form of a fort with a very high badqir. Close under the hills to the north-east is a date grove and a fine spring and 100 huts. Coarse rugs and saddle-bags are manufactured. Supplies in the form of sheep, goats, cattle, grain and forage could be collected in large quantities from the rich Jiruft plain. Camel-grazing is plentiful, and there is abundant water from a hdnz and the spring. There is a Naib-Kalantar. It owes its name to a fight which took p^ace between two forces, one from Bars and one from Baluchistan. Ihe inhabitants of Dusarl and the neighbourhood are estimated at 2,00U. Later in the year they amount to 4,000. In 1908 there were 900 donkeys, 500 sheep and goats. Besides the owners of^ flocks, there are many in habitants who live by various trades.

It is marked by a large crimson-coloured rock, which is now on our right; this rock is called “Girl,” but why it is so named, our guide was unable to inform me. At about the 8th mile the scenery becomes magnificent. We are now confronted with a series of natural weirs or dams, which are formed of stones swept down the hillsides and ravines. These weirs fill up the entire bed of the river and the stones are of every size, shape and colour, snow-white predominating. The track is not confined to one side, but winds about, avoiding as far as possible the deep pools under the cliffs and larger boulders, and the jumbled masses irregularly scattered round. The climb over these dams is a difficult one for192 FAK—FAR *Sr m animals, particularly so for horses. We had to mount and dismount every 10 minutes or so, either to cross the deeper streams or assist our horses over the slippery polished rock and stone. . u The camels, too, had tough work in many places, and were with ditticuity and a considerable expenditure of Baluch bad language, kept on their ieet. At 12 miles we got to a clear level bit, beyond which the gorge again closes in and becomes blocked with huge emerald-green, ruby-red and snow- white boulders as big as omnibuses. They have a curious ettect, tor at first sight it appears as if all further progress up the gorge were impossible* The grandeur of the scenery presented to our view can be but imper fectly described ; lighted up as it was by the fresh morning sun, every con ceivable colour and shade showed, both on the cliff sides, in the deep pools and along the gurgling eddies. One also sees some curious grotos excavated by the force and volume of water, which (judging by the high watermark, 15 to 20 feet) must produce a very effective sight m bad weather, and harmonize well with the wild grandeur of the scene. One longs to dally in such a delightful spot. , ., We now approach the end of the gorge. A bend to the right to avoid a large, deep pool (in which are seen shoals of small fish, like the sardine and chilwa jdts ); another sharp turn to the left round a huge green boulder, and we emerge from the confines of the Band-i-Nilag range. From this point may be seen the date-grove of Fanuch a quarter of a mile ahead at the junction of two ndlds.” The Mirabad kaur, which rises in the hills near the village of Darambakam is the main stream. It flows past the village of The Fanuch river. Mirabad, from which it takes its name, and is joined by the Ziarat and Kanton streams.

GABRIG (River)— east A river m Bashakard. Its true course is not known, but Galindo is of opinion that the river which is shown under this name on St. John’s map as emptying itself into the Arabian Sea to the south of Guh Kuh, and a stream which he himself struck in the neighbourhood of Gwatar are one and the same. ; That portion of it which was explored by Galindo meets the Minab- Bmt road some 21 miles east-south-east of Barman, and here its bed is very rocky and broken—a typical example indeed of all the Bashakard streams. Galindo gives the following description of it :— The country consisted of great waves of up-tilted strata—sandstone in huge slabs, turned up at an angle of 50 or 60 degrees. The stream had forced its way through these ridges in a series of sharp zigzags. Where the channel cut a ridge at right angles there was always a barrier of huge reefs of rock. Then it would turn abruptly to right or left and flow between two ridges, in a bed consisting of a smooth slippery trough of stone, till it broke through the next ridge, and so on. At almost every curve the bank on the concave side was a perpendicular scarp with a deep pool of water at its foot and the convex side a sort of moraine of huge boulders. The ridges of strata rose on either hand in confused masses of precipitous broken rock from 100 feet to 200 feet in height.” See also Jashk district .—November 1888.)

GlRI DlRlP— A settlement about 10 miles west of Bint, in Persian Baluchistan. It is on the Gari stream, the name “ Garl ” meaning “ river hollow.” The stream is dammed here and the water led in canals through extensive date-groves and fenced fields of beans, coarse tobacco, and wheat. Rice is also grown as a summer crop, and cotton is plentiful. Coming from the westward this place seems quite a delightful oasis after the sea of barren hills. Its irrigation is quite scientific, and there are many small well-built bridges. The walls of the fields and gardens have the appearance of being built of English bricks : so regularly square are the pieces of sandstone of which they are composed. To the north is a many-coloured mountain, which looks as if it had been struck by lightning ; boulders the size of a house lying about it anyhow. One canal, dug to bring the water direct from higher up the river, is upwards of a mile in length, and is crossed by two strong bridges of mud and stone. The river-bed is very broad and shingly, and studded with bushes. Below the dam it is white with salt and about 400 yards across. The water retained by the dam appears to stand all the year round, judging by the presence of a great deal of water weed. Mosquitoes are also present in large numbers in summer, and on the tops of neighbouring hills are many ‘ ‘ sinks ’ ’ or upper- storeyed huts, in which the people sleep to escape their attacks. The principal man in the place (1876) is Abd-ul-Kadir, elder brother of Mir Haji of Bint {q-v.). He is a corpulent, unhealthy looking, and apparent ly stupid man, who resigned the chiefship to rusticate here. Most of the inhabitants are slaves or servants. There are only two or three families of any importance. . ; 4 AH the way down the valley from Darap are villages with cultivation and palm-groves.— {Floyer.) GAR!

An old ruined fort stands perched on a conical hill to the south-west of the town. There is some cultivation as well as large date-groves. The village possesses about 200 cattle and 500 sheep and goats, but supplies, except dates, are scanty. The water-supply is said to be good and plentiful in ordinary years, but when Medley and Massy visited the place in 1893, owing to the drought, water had to be obtained from shallow wells in the river-bed, which though sweet, was muddy. There is a good camping-ground .—{Medley and Massy, July 1893.) GASK— A hamlet, 3| miles from Bazman, in Persian Baluchistan.— {Brazier- Creagh, 1894.) GATAN— A village in the Biaban district {q.v.).

There are about 10 shops in the village. A considerable trade with Afghanistan in dried fiuits, hides, wool and ghi passed through here at one time, but at present (1904) owina to the oppression of the local officials, most of the trade seems to have been directed to Turbat-i-Haidari, where since the establishment of a British Consulate, Afghans can obtain justice.

There are two dug-out shallow pools here which contain impure, undrinkable water, having an intensely sickly saline taste which is SI LB. 2AGAZ—GAZ persistent for some considerable time after tasting it. Neither horse® nor camels would drink it. The vicinity of the pools for a quarter of a mile round is hard and crusted as if frozen, cracking under the feet, this is due to the earth being impregnated with this saline stuff (carbonate of lime ?). In parts, the neighbouring ground is covered with a thick efflorescent layer of the same substance. It is now abandoned as a halting-place by kdfilehs, no water being avail- able. The pool is said to last until the middle of April, but the water, brackish and indifferent at best, must become worse as it dries up. A few stunted “ pir” bushes in the neighbourhood offer inferior fodder. At this place the tracks to Isfakeh and Maskhutan divide. The former is on the road to Chahbar via Tib and Geh, the latter on that to Fanuch. Isfakeh is about 23 miles distant: Baluchan Chah, on the other road, 14 or 15 miles. On the 28th January 1876 FI oyer found the pool at Gazkuk covered with a thin coating of ice, and before reaching Maskhutan he was over taken by a severe snowstorm.

The Lashar and Shigim hills separate it from the low-lying Bampur district. It is drained by the Geh river, which is formed by the junction of the Gung and Kashi rivers just below the plateau on which Geh is situated ; 6 miles further south it receives the large Sarhai stream. The Gung river rises from two sources in the Shigim hills. The western Sources of Gung river. stream flows by the village of Abudan, and the eastern sf ream by the village of Kuch ; uniting a little way north of Shigiaa village, the river flows through the large naia 2 A 2212 GEH—GEH on the west of Geh date grove.

The Geh river, winding through the Makran hills, emerges on the Dasht The Geh river or Kaur-i- plain, and finally enters the sea at Ras Gurdim, Geh. some 35 miles west of Chahbar. The town, or rather village, of Geh is a large and important one. It is . . 115 miles from Bampur, i;taPib the principal town in Lashar, and 85| miles from Chahbar. It is the first place at which a force proceeding from the coast to the interior can obtain supplies in any quantity. It is fairly fertile and well watered. Good crops are produced here and in the district. Geh was formerly the ancient capital of Makran, and was the scene of many a toughly fought battle be tween the Belopi and Gichki tribes. The former, being conquerors, held sway as far west as Bint, and south over Surag, but owing to internal strife, this latter place fell into the hands of the Persianst in 1848. The town is situated in an extensive date grove at the junction of two rivers, namely, the Gung and Kashi, the former or westernmost of which is the largest. The villages consist of some 500 houses and huts ; the former arc oblong, flat-roofed, and strongly built, and are mostly situated to the north of the grove. Many of the huts are scattered throughout the grove, and are for the most part circular, average diameter 18 to 20 feet, height 10 feet, and dome-shaped; they are formed of a stout framework of date branches thatched with jnsh palm and covered with a network of ^Ish r&gt;ping.On page 212, under Geh village, in line 10, after “ Persians in 1848 55 add- i* About 1908 Saiyid Khan was chief of Geh, and lent his support to the arms trade but prSsure was brought on him by the British expedition to Makran in 1911, and he was induced to enter into ^n agreement tojr^ vent Afghans making a convenience of his territories.

The name of a halting-place, on a river of the same name, a tributary of the Kunarnai river, at mile 126f, on the route from Bampurto Rigan, between the Zahu and Kunarnai rivers. Grass and grazing here are good and abundant, also en route. A tamarisk jungle exists in the river bed , water is scanty and brackish, from a spring. Allround, the country is of volcanic formation. Here the southern edge of the Kirman- Karmasbir desert is separated from the Bampur desert (the latter draining into the Milan-i-Jihun) by the range of hills, which is a continuation to the north-west of the Daman-i-Bazman (q v.).

GHISHKAN, RUDKHANEH-I- (Kirman)— A small river between Panab and Rudkhaneh-i-Duzdl, on the road from Bandar Abbas to Bam via Khanu— (Euan-Smith.)218 GIK-GIN l i miles from Bint and about 7 miles from tbe Jcdfileh camping place, on the Pasga stream. (See Pasga.) On to the Sadaich river (q-v.) was about 23 miles south-west, over a shingly plain. About this point the Gidich, flowing south from the direction of the Band-i-Nilag, bends east, and is crossed at about 9 miles from the Pasga camping place above- mentioned by the track leading south to Kashi and Karvan. It continues an easterly course, and receiving the Pasga, falls into the Bapch or Bint river (q.v.). The Gidich is described as a noble stream. Where crossed by the Kashi road its valley is a mile wide, and quite straight for 5 or 6 miles. The hills on each side slope down to a broad belt of fine tamarisk and other trees, betwe-en which runs the smooth dark blue river. In January 1876 it was about 60 yards broad, with an average depth of 2 feet, and a velocity of about 5 miles an hour. The river bed is in places large shingle, in others partly vertical strata of hard blue clay. It is from this clay, ‘ ‘ gil, 5 ’ that the river is said to derive its name, the “ Z ” suffering a not uncommon change into “ &lt;2 ”. The clay being porous is used for making water- bottles. (See Bint.) Just to the right of the crossing place the river rushes down a natural weir, caused by the projection of a stratum of the blue clay, which is almost of the consistency of rock. The water of the Gidich is good. Firewood and camel forage being abundant, a very convenient halting-place might be found on its banks. The stream is said to be perennial, but the volume of water diminishes considerably in summer. Like all rivers in this region it is liable to floods, which occur in winter. It may then be impassable for a day or two. As a rule, there is no difficulty in crossing.— (Floyer.)

GlSHAN— A village in the Shamil district (q,v.), GISHO (Kutai) Elev. A hutal in Kirman, in the range which runs in a south-easterly direc tion in continuation of the Jamal Bariz range. It is crossed by the Rigan- Minab route at the 40th mile from Rigan, between the camping-grounds of Dehan-i-Abbas ’AH and Mil-i-Farhad. The ascent from the north side* js easy, but the descent on the south side is much steeper. The soil is gypsum, sandstone and clay, and but little work would be required to make a good cart-road across the kutal, and in Newcomen’s opinion it would even be possible to lay a railway along this alignment. Even in its present state the kutal has been traversed by Persian artillery, the guns being drawn by eight horses and drag ropes being used where necessary. The kutal receives its name from the Baluchi “ Gish,” which means an oleander tree, from the large number of these which cover the hillside—A few miles west is the Gudar-i-Sabzu which is used by camels ancl is said to be about as Q&amp;8y.—{Jenninqs, 1885 ; Newcomen, 1905 • Sukes 1906.) &gt; &gt; v , GISPURDAH— A hamlet and date grove inMakran, a little south of Kahn Abi, on the Ramishk-Fanuch road.— (Sykes, 1898.)

It is called after # Sipall district of that name, which forms the summer jetypat pf the Khans-222 GUD-GUD J. of Bara. Owing to its elevation it is never hot, while the hills are well wooded and water abounds. From the pass, looking north, a c6mmanding panoramic view is obtain ed. Below lies the broad valley of Deh Bakri, through which meanders a broad swift stream of the same name. It gradually becomes lost to view in the plain beyond, where it joins the Bam drainage. Away in front beyond the broad plain is the Darzin range. To the west are the lofty snow-clad Sarduleh hills ; and behind lies the Jamal Bariz range. On reach ing the foot of the steep hill (which is the part of the pass that gets block ed with snow and becomes impassable) the road runs along the bed of a dry ravine for half a mile and then down the centre of Deh Bakri valley through broad strips of cultivation. Leaving the valley by the river-bed, the track sometimes leads along the hillside and again along the river-bed. In this valley is, in all probability, the site of the most ancient capital of the province—the classical Carmana. GUDlR-I-GANDEH KUH— Elev. 6,900'. A pass in Khorasan, about 70 miles from Birjand, on the road to Parah in Afghanistan, crossing a range which runs south from the Saman Shah to the Kuh-i-Baqaran. The altitude is nearly 7,000 feet, but the ascent from the west is by a steep narrow path, gradually ascending the course of a ravine from the Ab-i-Gandeh Kuh stream; the descent is easy and by a good road. For wheeled vehicles, the pass would require a good deal of making and some blasting. The top of the pass is basaltic, while granite trap and old red sandstones go to form the sides.— (Rozario ; Bellew; MacGregor.) GUDAR-I-GIL or GUDAR-I-GILl— Elev. 400'. A low and easy pass in the Minab district, 72 miles from the town of that name, on the road to Rigan.

Animals will drink the water of the well, but it js too salt for human consumption. About 2 miles south-west of Gurg the230 GUR—GUB Gura rivet, a stream about 20 feet wide by 6 inches deep, crosses the track, flowing westwards. This appears to be the stream which Goldsmid calls the Rudn-Mahi, aiul its waters are exceedingly salt and bitter. The climate of Gurg is bitterly cold in winter, but the heat in summer is so intense that Goldsmid states that it is necessary for a rider to wrap bandages round his stirrup to prevent his horse or camel from being scorched by the contact, and to protect the rider s feet. King Wood found the temperature of his tent in May 1904 to be 117° F. Fuel is abundant, and copper is said to be found in the hills.

The village is in the JagrTwr of the Khan of Sib. Water is good and abundant, and there are many date groves and some cultivation. Its position commands the Badamo pass leading to Gazu and Ladis. The fort, which was a very strong one, was treacherously seized during the disturbances in 1902, by the Sardar of Sib, who killed its owner and demolished its battlements and flanking defences. There is a most curious and romantic spring here, near which is the tomb of a celebrated saint, Mir Muhammad, a Baluchi Pir. The water, which is very salt, flows from a rock of variegated colours—red, blue, yellow, etc., in all directions, over a smooth stony surface, and as it evaporates in the sun, it leaves a deposit of excellent, white salt, which is collected and utilized. The water rises through a single hole about 6 inches in diameter, in the top of a round knoll of rock. One legend regarding this hole—fully be lieved in by every one here—is as follows :— A man accused of theft, or a woman of adultery, is made to put his (or her) hand into this hole.

GWATAR (Bay and Village) — Gwatar bay is a great indentation in the Makran coast line at the point where Persian territory ends and Kalat territory begins : the bay is about equally divided between the Persian and British spheres of influence. At the entrance, the width is 19 miles and within it is somewhat less: the depth inland is about 11 miles and the whole area of the bay is entirely open to the south : the bottom is of mud, very flat and even. The sound ings, which are 6 fathoms in the entrance, begin to diminish half-way towards the foot of the bay and thereafter shoal regularly to the low swampy coast which forms its northern shore : the land on the east and west side of the bay is rocky and hilly, and on the west side rises to a table-land from 300 to 400 feet in height. With the eastern half of the bay, which lies in Baluchistan, we are not .concerned : the chief feature of the remainder is the Dashtiari Chil river which, coming down from Bahu the capital of the Bahu district, and 2 D 2236 GWA—GWA I if passing 4 miles to the east of Miri Bazar, the capital of the Dashtiari district, enters the bay at its north-western corner.

The trade of Gwatar, which is one of the three principal parts of Per sian Makran, formerly nearly equalled that of Chahbar, but is at present hampered by disturbances in the interior, and the value of the annual exports does not now exceed Rs. 50,000, nor that of the annual imports Rs. 30,000.

HALIL or HILIRl or HALIRI RUD— A river in Kirman, which rises in the mountains to the west of Sarduieh, and after a generally south-easter^ course mingles its waters with those of the Bampur river in the Jaz Muiian Hdmun. It is the largest river in the province, and, indeed, the only one of any importance, but even it has not a perennial flow throughout its entire course, and running water is said to exist permanently only as far south as Bijnabad, though it can always be obtained by digging 10 or 15 feet below the surface. The Halil valley is very rich, and the fertile plains of Rudbar and Jiruft are irrigated by its water. It is largely a snow-fed stream, much of its water coming from the snow-capped Jamal Bariz range, and like all Persian rivers is liable to sudden and disastrous floods. Jennings experienced one such flood when marching from Rigan to Minab in April 1885—the worst, the natives said, that had been known for 20 years. He found at Hasan Sultan a kdfileh of 200 camels, carrying merchandise fromBandar Abbas to Sistan, which had been encamped on the bank for 30 days, waiting for the flood to subside. They eventually got the ; r ba g- gage over on rafts made of massaks and sticks, and hauled their camels through the stream with ropes, being five days thus employed. On this occasion large flocks of sheep and goats were swept away; while in a simi lar flood which occurred three years previously the natives said that upwards of 100 people had been drowned. Grey states that where crossed by the Minab-Rigan road the breadth of the river is 900 yards, and that a bridge of that length would be required. The bottom and banks are of sand, and after heavy rain the river sometimes overflows to a breadth of about 1 mile.-—(Jennings, 1885 ; Sykes, 1902 ; Grey, 1905.) HALIRI RtTB, see Halil Rud.

A remarkable island situated off the south coast of Qishm island, in close proximity to Khargu point, from which it is divided by a strait a mile wide and from 6 to 12 fathoms deep in the fair-way. Hanjam has been not inaptly called the ‘ ‘ Perim of the Persian Gulf, ’ ’ and would form a good base . of naval observation, the Gulf being here so narrow that the Arabian coast is visible on a clear day ; it would not, however, be a suitable site for a defended naval establishment. Hanjam island is of a nondescript but compact shape, and measures; 5| miles from north-north-east to south-south-west by about 3 miles in breadth. Physically it is an agglomeration of rugged hills decreasing in elevation towards the south end of the island : the highest summit is Table Hill, 1 mile from the north end, which reaches 350 feet. The dismal aspect of Hanjam from the sea, whence it appears as a jmass of barren, broken and almost black rock streaked here and there with white and red, does not belie its real character. The only self-sown trees are the her and acacia, and grass—even in spring—is only sufficient to tinge slight ly one or two of the main valleys. Geologically the island is as rich in interest and variety as botanically it is destitute. The prevailing rock is a milliolitic limestone, but patches of maroon coloured stone and soil are numerous and are frequently indications of the presence of rock salt. In the northern part of the island are several salt caves, notably one * towards the centre of the island, entered by along, low, narrow passage in the face of a hill: it contains a grotto of rare beauty adorned with stalactites and tracery in the purest white salt. The mouths of some of the caves are adjoined by piles of stones and metallic substances of various colours and attractive appearance, which have excited the admiration of more than one visitor ; among them appear to be sulphur, red ochre, end blocks of specular iron ore which are used by the fishermen of the island as sinkers on account of their weight. A valley near the western coast, about 300 yards north-west of the foot of Table Hill, presents another geological curiosity in the form of clay pillars bearing a singularly close resemblance to the trunks of fossilised date-trees. In 1904 two of these pillars, on being broken open, were found to hold a core or second pillar of flint of the same length as the first and one of the clay pillars contained in addition of * Described by Floyer ; see his “ Unexplored Baluchistan,” pages 124—6. 61 l B 4 2 B.242 HAN—HAN fossilised bivalve shell. The outer clay case was extremely hard but peeled off in layers under the blows of a hammer*. The climate of Hanjam in summer is barely tolerable ; the heat is ter rific and is aggravated during the months of June, July and August by the moisture with which the atmosphere is laden, by the assaults of sand flies and other insects and, in the neighbourhood of the coast, by the stench of decomposing sea-weed. The rainy season begins in October and ends in March. In the winter of 1903-04 the fall was considerable and filled the reservoirs, but for 4 or 5 years previously there had been very little ran. In the hills are some wild goats, in reality domestic goats which have escaped from the villages and their descendants, and the island is now overrun by hares, which were introduced here and on Tunb island about 1882 by Mr. Ffinch, then Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs. There are no wild carnivora. Birds are not uncommon, especially towards the open ground at the south-west of the island ; among them are the kite, hawk, stone-plover, lark, dove and blue-rock pigeon, the latter inhabiting the caves and sometimes the deep wells of the island. The edible oyster is plentiful along the shores and pearl-oysters also abound. Sand flies and other insects exist in myriads and are troublesome at certain seasons. Only three points on Han]am are at present inhabited. Of these the first is the British telegraph station, which was re-established at the north end of the island in April 1904 after having been in abeyance for 13 years. The buildings are situated on a cliff, J mile inland from the north coast of the island, and are only a few yards to the northward of the plinth which makes the site of the original station. The staff consists of an Assistant Superin tendent and 2 clerks. To the south of this old site is a valley of consi derable extent in which are two or three wells, the best of which is reserved for the use of the Telegraph establishment. The water is about 18 feet from the surface and varies from sweet to brackish : advantage has been taken of it to lay out a small garden and plant some trees. A native village called Masheh, consisting of a few huts, stands 300 yards east of the site of the old station and may be regarded as a dependency of the present one; the inhabitants are native emplojes of the I. E. T. D. who were brought here from Jashk. The most populous place on the island is the village of Han] am, situat ed on a stretch of flat open country by the coast at the south-east side of the island. The plain adjoining it is all under cultivation. Hanjam is a typical Arab village, comparatively clean and well-built, and consists of about 200 houses. It possesses 8 or 9 gardens well stocked with fruit trees and irrigated from wells 20 to 25 feet deep which are worked by bullocks ; there are about 1,400 date-palms and the other principal crops are wheat, barley , onions, and pumpkins. The Arabs of Hanjam belong to the Bani Yas tribe of the Arabian coast, wdience they are said to have immigrated about 3 generations ago ; their intercourse is still chiefly * Mr. Q. W. Laing (?) of the Indo-European Telegraph Department on whose excellent account of Hanjam the greater part of this article is founded, has seen similar freaks of nature at Qnnara on the coast of Makran.HAN—HAft 243 with that coast and particularly with the town of Dibai. They are mainlv independent, intelligent^ industrious and extremely hospitable. They own 36 pearl boats which constitute their principal means of livelihood • the bulk oi the male population is absent on the Arabian pearl-banks every year from June to . October, not returning to the island until they have disposed of their takings to Indian merchants in Trucial ’Oman or at l P6arl mart of Lm g el1 * The women during the same season seek p oyment at Minab and other places as date-pickers, and return to the settlement about the same time as their male relatives. In summer con sequently Han] am village is practically deserted, except by aged care takers In winter the men of Hanjam mostly devote themselves to whal ing and shark-fishing and are said to be very dexterous in the use of the harpoon, bpt some remain on shore to tend the cold weather crops. For shore fishing the people of Hanjam use a torpedo-shaped fish trap of wicker work with one inch meshes and a cone-shaped entrance projecting inwards from one end ; this is sunk at a moderate depth in a passage between two roc vs, and is taken out at the end of the day with such fish as having wandered m have been unable to find their way out again. To this village and that of Ghail, belong 7 camels, 40 donkeys, 50 cattle and 400 goats all of winch are allowed to roam at large over the island, and the solitary dog which is the only representative of its species on Hanjam, is kept here! About a mile south of the village, in the first series of hills from the coast are some masonry remains which the Arabs attribute to the Portuguese The third settlement is Ghail, an off-shoot of Hanjam village situated on the v’est coast about 3 miles south-west of the teleoraph station and 21 miles north-west of Hanjam village. It contains aboSt 30 houses and depends like Hanjam chiefly on pearl-diving. Here there is a well of excellent water within a few feet of the sea beach. Four or five walled gardens, have sprung up about 100 yards east of the village ; in these are fruit-trees, beds of onions and a few pumpkins and beans'. In the gardens are some eight shallow wells and between them and the village an artificial lake for storing rain-water has been created by damming up a hollow which passes the village. The supply of water at Ghail is almost inexhaustible and. native vessels anchoring between Hanjam and Qishm island procure their supply from this place by boat when the tanks at the north end of the island are empty. Besides the telegraph station and the villages of Hanjam and Ghail there are now no other settlements on the island, but traces of former hamlets exist in more than one place and in the valley south of the old telegraph station are the remains of walled plots of cultivation. Some idea of the resources and trade of Hanjam has been given in des cribing the island and villages. The salt-caves and pits, it may be observed, have not been worked in recent years. It remains to add that there is a valuable anchorage between Hanjam and Qishm visited by most native vessels proceeding up the Gulf in order to take water on board or in some cases to obtain shelter from the Shimal which here blows frem the west-south-west. This place was formerly a rendezvous of pirates and is still occasionally used by slavers ; one was recently surprised here 2 E 2244 HAN-HAN and a slave released. The anchorage is a double one lying on both sides of a sandy spit at the northernmost point of the island, cn which a beaecn and high-water mark have recently been erected by the cable ship of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The anchorage is sheltered trom the prevalent winds, but the bottom is hard and a ship is liable to drag her anchor, especially in consequence of the tides which run strong during the ebb. Vessels drawing about 10 feet can be beached on the spit. The western part of the anchorage is the better, but is partially exposed to the Shimal, to avoid which vessels must change their position to the other side of the cape. The depth in the anchorage is about 9 fathoms. Masheh Bay is the place where vessels load salt from the Namakdan mines on Qishm island for the Calcutta and other markets ; there being no safe anchorage off Namakdan the salt is brought here in lighters, a distance of over 20 miles, and transhipped. . „ The principal authority on the island is the Shaikh of the village or Han- iam who appears to have no relations with the Persian authorities. No revenue or tribute is paid by the islanders and a Persian Customs post and two Persian flag staffs at the north end of the island are as yet the only evidences of Persian sovereignty. 1 . . . „ ^ , .. No account of Han] am would be complete which failed to mention tne ruins on the north coast. The principal are two mosques 275 yards apart of which the eastern appears to have been a Persian construction and the western stands on a cliff overhanging the sea. On the northern side of the former along the beach, extend traces of a settlement which appears to have consisted of 200 or 300 houses : among the remains here some coppers dating from 113 to 164 years back have been discovered. Immediately to the south of these ruins is a hollow 250 yards square containing graves and headstones, and in the vicinity of the mosque are 9 reservoirs hewn out of the solid limestone rock and lined with an impenshab e hydraulic cement locally called Saruj. The largest of these reser voirs is 60 feet long, 12 feet wide and 12 feet deep and has a cylmd- ricaliy vaulted roof of ordinary Gach and stones. The western mosque annears to have been built with the ordinary maroon-coloured cement of the island; it is also adjoined by reservoirs, 3 4 a graveyard which with the remains of houses on the hill behind indicate that it may have been the nucleus of a distinct settlement About a mile from the village of Ghail are three blocks of granite, the largest weighing several tons, of which the presence is not in any way accounted for except by a superstitious tale.

The former says in his narrative :— J “ Leaving Ghistiqan on the 2nd of March we camped in a ravine only 3 miles distant.” J ****** “ The next day we crossed a wide gravelly plain to the foot of the hills behind the first ridge of which we round a slender stream flowing westwards to the Nihing. Turning due north up this we camped amid dismal preci pices at the foot of the Hinduan pass. On reaching the summit of the pass, 4,100 feet above the sea, the next day, the finest view we had seen in Baluchistan burst upon us. Some 25 miles to the north an imposing range of mountains, with bold peaks and rugged sides, stretched along the horizon. In front of them, and partially hidden by the lesser ranges parallel to that on which we stood, lay a wide valley sloping up to the more distant hills. This was the Kfihak valley and the hills beyond it the Sianeh Kuh, and the Kuh-i-Sabz, between which the Mashkid river finds its way to the great desert which stretches away to the Helmand. Descending the Hinduan Pass, we entered the Askan torrent bed, now quite dry. A couple of miles further on, we halted for the night (March 4th) at a tiny spot of cultivation in the mouth of a ravine from the east ward. ” * ***** “ We found on the Askan ravine in close proximity to each other, camps of Baluchis belonging to Persian Bampusht, to Panjgur and to independ ent Kuhak.I 250 HIN—HOC The next day we made a short march to Tashhflk, a date grove without WWtaHof We had now passed two considerable ranges parallel to the habitation.

HORMUZ (Island) * *—Lat. 27° 5' 55'; Long. 56° 29' 5'. The north point of this island, the site of the celebrated “ Ormuz” of former times, is situated 11 miles east-south-east of Bandar Abbas, and 4 miles south of the nearest part of the Persian mainland ; the mouth of Khur Minab is distant from it 19 miles due eastward. Hormuz island is nearly circular in shape with a diameter of from 4 J to 5 miles. The coast is free from pronounced indentations and the only promon tory is the northern point, already mentioned, which is low and flat and pro jects nearly a mile from the general body of the island, its width across its base being also about a mile. The passage between Hormuz and the mainland navigable for vessels of moderate draft is only a mile wide and its depth, which at the narrowest part of the strait is 10 fathoms, diminishes to 4, and even at the end towards Bandar Abbas. The island, except at its northern and southern extremities, is surrounded by a belt of shoal water of consi- derable width. Except the fiat promontory on the north side and a strip o fairly level ground half a mile to a mile in width which follows the eastern shore, Hormuz is covered with jagged hills of brilliant and variegated hues. The dominant colour is a reddish-purple largely streaked with white, while the principal geological ingredients are rock-salt, red ochre and a greenish very adhesive clay. The hills are on the average over 300 feet in height and^one peak in the centre reaches 690 feet. All the ravines, and indeed whoxe valleys, in the interior of the island are in crusted with salt, and present the appearance of being lightly powdered with snow. Upon the banks of the ravines are pure white saline incrustations varying in thickness rom 3 to 12 inches and some of the ravines, in breadth from 6 to 15 feet, are spanned by natural bridges of salt strong enough to support a man. . Hormuz is almost entirely barren ; its aspect of all but metallic sterility is relieved only by a few stunted kundr trees and some patches of barley on the plain near Hormuz village. A few gazelle are the only natural fauna. There is no permanently inhabited place on the island except Hormua yi age which, with the population, is described in a separate article under its own name ; in that place also will be found some remarks on trade and resources. Here it may be added that of copper, specular iron ore, red oxide o iron and salt, existing on the island, only the last two are worked. The supplies and transport which the island affords only suffice for the needs of * A osJ? ? p° rmuz an °horage occurs as an inset in Admiralty Chart No. 2373— be found ^ erS ^ an where also a distant view of the island from the sea wilS252 HOR-HOR the inhabitants, and the quantity of sweet water available, chiefly rain-water collected in reservoirs, is strictly limited. Vegetables and fodder are practically unobtainable. The revenue of Hormuz is farmed by the Mu’In-ut-Tujjar of Tehran from the Persian Government for 14,000 tumdns a year but the political control is vested in the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The representative of the MuTn-ut-Tujjar is a resident agent by whom the taxes are collected ; these are : general revenue, a royalty on the red oxide mines (called Ganj or Galak), and a sort of poll tax on the miners. This individual has a salary of 50 tumdns a month, besides perquisites arising from the salvage of wrecks, etc., and is responsible for the entire administration of the island. The Deputy-Governor of Bandar Abbas sometimes seeks to interfere in Hormuz affairs in the name of his master, the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Persian Government are represented by an ins pector of the Imperial Customs Department. The simple topography of Hormuz island is summed up in the table below:— Name of place. Position.

Nil There is a well here 40 feet deep with water which is fairly good but slightly brack ish. There are also ruins of what appears to have been a small town.HOR—HOT 253 HORMUZ (Village.)— The only inhabited place on the island of Hormuz and the sole remaining vestige of the once celebrated city of “ Ormuz.” The village is situated oS the neck of the northern promontory between the Portuguese fort at its extremity and the ruins of the ancient city upon the landward side. The place consists of about 200 houses, and the population may rise, while the salt and oxide mines are being actively worked, to 1,200 souls, but falls in summer to less than half that number in consequence of an annual emigration to the mainland, especially to Minab, which the hot weather and prospects of employment in picking dates combine to produce. Persians predominate, many of them being natives of Bashakard and Rudbar ; but there are also Baluchis and Arabs who have long since forgotten to what tribe their ancestors belonged. The proportions of the mixture are also roughly measured by the fact that about frds of the popu lation is Shi’ah as against Jrd Sunni. The inhabitants of Hormuz village are mostly sailors, fishermen and miners ; they are reported to own 8 large Mashuwas, 6 Baqarahs and 1 Ghunchah, with an aggregate burthen of 620 tons and employing 172 hands. The ordinary anchorage at Hormuz is half a mile to the east of the Portuguese fort, where the bottom is of mud, the depth of water from 4 to 5 fathoms. A little barley is grown on the plain near the village, there are hardly any date-palms. A few reservoirs exist for the storage of rain-water and there are some wells yielding water which is slightly brackish. A Qadamgah of merely local importance stands 1 mile south of the village. The village is the seat of the Persian agent who governs the island. The Portuguese fort is now in a dilapidated con dition owing to the removal of stones from the walls for building purposes, but it still contains two magnificent reservoirs, empty but in good repair. * HOT BALHCH or BASHAR— A tribe inhabiting the Lashar district south of Bamphr, in Persian Baltl- chistan, and also wandering all over the Bampur desert and neighbouring tracts, even down to Chahbar and the coast. They seem to be generally nomadic in their habits, and Floyer calls them the Bedouin of the countrv. The men are fine, wiry fellows of great endurance. They all carry a spin ning machine stuck in their girdles opposite the leach* forming a contrast to tF ir wild looks and fierce conversation. They own some camels, which must be able to eat all kinds of fodder, and very many small donkeys, goats and sheep. These they drive with them wherever in the sandy waste they may find scanty dried grass, and carry the patches of woollen or goats’ hair cloth which, supported on small sticks, are regarded as tents, and are in fact miniature copies of the tents of Persian Iliats. Mir Hot, of Pip, was the principal chief of the Hots of Lashar in 1876. He is supposed to be devoted to Persian interests, and the Governor of Bampur probably derives a certain amount of support from the Lasharis m the shape of a contingent of irregulars, when taking the field against other tribes. * An instrument which serves either as a knife or a saw.264 HUD-HUM HUDAK— A large village in Kirman, 21 miles north-east of Kirman, on the road to Naiband.— {Stewart.) • HUDIAN— A village in Geh {q.v.) on the Sirhai in Makran.

A conspicuous peak in Persian Baluchistan, about 60 miles east of Bam- phr, and a few miles to the south of the road from that place to Magas. It is situated among the hills which lie between the Bampur plain and the higher country to the east, and though near the watershed is quite separated from it, its drainage going entirely to the Bampur stream. Sykes writes:—“The climb from Manish took 14 hours and was danger ous owing to the absence of guides (the natives declaring the mountain had never been ascended) and to the nature of the mountain, which was com posed of friable slate, although its base was limestone. Kuh-i-Hamant is marked as a volcano on the latest maps, and it resembles one from the east and west, but from the north it is shown to be a sawback, and so narrow that we had to sit astride when moving along at the top. ’ ’—{Lovett ; Sykes&gt; 1893 .)HttMDlN— A village in Persian Makran (q.v.) HUMMOCKS (The)*— There are three remarkable hills to the north-east of Ras Dastakan in the island of Qishm, Persian Gulf. They are useful as landmarks when entering Basidu roads. The western hummock, 2 miles N. | E. from the point, is table-topped, and the lowest of the three. The centre which bears north-east by east two-thirds of a mile from the western, has a rounded top. The eastern, and highest, is 585 feet high, and bears north-east by E | E., 1| miles from the western ; it is table-topped, has a little bush on the top, and may be seen 25 miles. All three are quite pre cipitous on the south face, and the eastern is nearly joined to along range of table-land, a little lower than the hummock, which extends 4 miles east-north-eastward, with a precipitous face scuthward, and ends in a bluff. Two miles east by north from this bluff is a table-shaped hill or hummock 550 feet high, standing in the plain north of Kavani village, and to the eastward of this are lower ranges extending as far as the salt hills. (Constable; Stiffe; Persian Gulf Pilot.) HUNI (Hills)— These form part of the range bounding the coast plain in Persian Baluchistan. They lie between the Gabilg and Sadaich rivers, and are the eastern part of the range marked on St. John’s map as the “ Kuh-i-Lffh.” West of the Gabrig the Huni hills are continued by the Gurani or Gvaran hills ; and east of the Sadaich is the Surag range.— (Floyer.) On the telegraph route map the eastern part of the Huni hills is marked Chagkuh ; and beyond the Sadaich, the hills which Floyer calls the Sftrag range, are marked Darhaman Kuh. Malik Chadar, Maliki Chidak or Malikani Chedag. the ancient boundary mark of Makran, is|at the southern foot of the Huni range. HUNZUK— Elev. 3,850'. A portion of the Kaju river in Makran, just south of Champ, the southerly continuation of which is called Kaurianch (q.v.). This section is not quite 2 miles long, and is very narrow. The kdfileh track, which runs along it, is most dangerous at its western entrance, as it has to pass over boulders and through deep pools of water. The Sharian river joins the Kaju, near the overlapping of the Hunzuk and Kaurianch.— (Janes, 1900.) HURDIN— A plain or valley in Persian Baluchistan, crossed by the road from Kashi and Kirman at 3 miles west of the kdfileh camping-ground, at the angle of the Pasga river (q.v.).

The village is situated on the Shahrl river, which flows into the Nihing, 40 miles almost due east of Sarbaz, and 35 miles south-south-east of Magas. It consists of 100 mud houses, generally loopholed, surrounding a well built and strong mud fort, 40 yards wide by 40 yards broad and about 50 feet high. The main tower is constructed of solid mud, to about half its height. Inside are many covered ways, that leading from the citadel being so low, that it is necessary to crawl along it. Rifle fire would make little impression against it, but from the neighbouring hills, gunfire would prove most effective. There is a well within the citadel. A small column under Major Tighe occupied the place in February 1902, they being the first Europeans ever to visit the district. At that time water was good and abundant ; fuel and camel-grazing scarce, and sup plies unprocurable. , The Irafshan valley is about half a mile broad and 2 miles long, and has many date groves with a considerable amount of terraced cultivation well watered by the Shahri river. The neighbouring hills are barren,IRA—ISF 259 and the intervening valleys much cut up by ndlds, which makes the move ment o_± troops and transport a difficult operation. The Irafshan district runs roughly from south-east to north-west for some oO miles, from near Sarbaz to Bum Gvaz on the Shahrl river and contains the villages of Afshan, Ashar and Irafshan. Nominally it forms part of the Dizak district, and the revenue collected in 1902 was said to have been Rs. 3,000. In all Baluchistan there.is no more mountainous and inaccessible tract than tins and it forms the first place of refuge to which all border outlaws, w ether Persian or British, turn when flying from justice. Geographically it rs of importance, as through it passes one of the most frequented of , ie roa_ds' leading from Kej to Magas, Bampur and Bizak. In 1902 the fort of Irafshan was taken by a small British force, and subsequently hand ed over to the Persian authorities, who at the same time demolished the other two forts m tlm valley, those of Afshan, and Ashar.

A large village in the Bashar District, in Persian Baluchistan; 35 miles from Bampur via Gish Kuh and Qasimabad, 28i miles via Mush Kuh and Gandam Maqam, and 15 miles north of Pib. The village consists of a tumbledown fort and some 80 flat-roofed houses and huts, situated on an elevated site on the west bank of the nald. There is a large date grove and a considerable amount of rich cultivated soil here ; supplies are pro curable in fair quantities and fuel and water are abundant. The water- supply is conveyed by a stone-faced qandt from a spring above the villages. Eater on, during the rains, the river-bed is full ; a part of the northern drainage from the Champ and Hamantak hills flows by this ndld and thus forms the Isfakeh river. This is the first place where a sprinkling of the Persian element has been met with. There is here so much salt 2 G 2260 ISF—ISF in the soil that horses are very liable to cracked-heels. There are side camel tracks to Champ, 2 stages ; and Maskhutan, 6 stages: and a desert route to Pahura.— (Sykes, 1893 ; Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) ISFANDAK (Persian Baluchistan)— Is the name of a valley in Persian Baluchistan, lying east and west at the south-east corner of the Dizak district, on the banks of the Mashkid river. The latter here possesses a good, perennial stream, and flows from west to east along the southern edge of the plain, which latter is a large glacis, sloping gradually up from the banks of the river to the foot of the Sianeh Kuh. Parallel to the Sianeh Kuh, which forms the northern border of this valley, is the Bampusht range, which forms its southern boundary. The political boundaries of Isfandak, which is now a sub-district (see Isfandak, which, as is hereafter explained, includes the village of the same name, as well as the villages of Murt, Darida and Kanokh) of Dizak, are as follows :— to the south and west, Bampusht ; to the north, Kalaghan ; to the east, Kuhak. The four villages which constitute the sub-district of Isfandak will now be described according to their importance :— (1) Isfandak (Lat. 27° 6' 34'; Long. 62° 51'0'; Elev. 3,448') is situated some 2 to 3 miles to the north of the Mashkid river. It possesses a mud fort, more or less out of repair, in which reside the two headmen. This fort can hold all the inhabitants and about 20 horses in times of emergency. Its inhabitants are Durshahzais, Tangazais and Zarozais. They say they are Rinds, but intermarried and closely allied ,to the Naushirvanis ©f Kharan. Regarding the latter St. John states— “ These NaushTrvanis appear to be the most warlike tribe in Baluchistan. They are of Persian origin, having emigrated from Nushirwan, a district and former town on the Zaindarud, a few mihjs above Isfahan. As they claim kindred with theMamasa- nis of Nal, an offshoot of the well-known L'r tribe of the same name, the Nfushir- vanis are probably also Lurs. I could not learn any tradition as to the date of their emigration into Baluchistan ; but it seems not improbable that they were found trouble some neighbours by Shah ’Abbas when he established his court at Isfahan, and turned out by him to make room for the Armenian colonists brought from the north, whose descendants are still numerous in the neighbourhood. ” The inhabitants number 300 souls, several of whom live in ghiddns and the village has 60 houses and owns 1,000 sheep and goats, 40 cows, 40 camels and two horses. There is one excellent kdrlz, from which flows a plentiful stream, while there is a flourishing date-palm grove and a con siderable amount of wheat, barley, and Indian-corn cultivation. St. John in 1872 states as follows :— “ Three miles from the halting-place, i.e., the Mashkid river, we passed the village of Isfandak, the first permanent habitation since leaving Mand three weeks before. It lies on the edge of extensive date groves, among which flourishing crops of young corn were springing. The buildings were of mud and stone ; and the whole place had an air of greater prosperity arid civilisation than anything seen in Southern Baluchistan. “ISF—ISF 261 Grazing and wood are plentiful, both here and in the neighbourhood The water is excellent and likewise plentiful. Grass, if required in quan- hTi mi f S f t T be ^.^e^nehKuh ;it is said also to exist along the alTover the'pTaTn I1Ver ' ^ dWarl Palm and tamarisks are plentiful As a rule the products suffice for the wants of the inhabitants : but in bad years wheat is imported from Dizak. Dates and blankets are ex- ported to Karachi and Gwadar. The blankets (called “ amshal ”) manu factured here are one foot wide and 45 feet long and have a very fine tex ture. Some are white, others dyed black. The former cost Re. 1 to Rs. 2 a piece and the black ones about double. The prices here are—wheat 15 seers, indian-corn 12 and fine flour 5 seers per rupee. The local man is the same as the Dizak man and weighs Rs. 100 i.e. 1| seers Indmn weight ; 40 Dizak mans are ground into atta for R c . L ihe village can turn out 50 men fully armed and equipped (2) Darida ; (3) Murt ; (4) Kanokh. Jennings did not visit these villages, but he was told that the latter was not then either inhabited or cultivated. The first two are said to be together about two-thirds the size of Isfandak. They each possess date- palms and cultivation ; and possess some 800 sheep and goats, as well as a few cows, camels, and donkeys. General account o//s/awda^.—This district, including the three inhabit ed villages mentioned, was forcibly annexed by Persia about 1874. A certain number of families, however, remained in the three villages and continued to cultivate the lands. Regarding this valley Blanford states “The Mashkld valley extends east and west to the north of the Bampusht ranee yCt an f t her va ] le y P lam parallel to those of GhTstiqan and Pishin. The stream which drains it issues from its eastern end to the northward. . J3 U r ^- e y at - ion ° f Mafkld stream near Isfandak is 3,250 feet, or 450 feet higher than Ghistiqan.. South of the stream the country consists of a confused mass of lnw ranges, much asm the Upper Nihing valley, whilst, as in that valley, a long gentlv sloping plain of gravel extends north of the river as far as the mountains of the Sianeh Kuh, a range rising to an elevation of 5,000 feet above the sea. *hA 1S J£ teWOrthy - that ’ !? a11 theSR P arallel plains, there is a great slope of gravel from t e northern margin, and none, or a very trifling one, from the south. The cause is probably that each range of hills rises to a greater height and more abruptly above ie p am to the south than to the north, hence a greater accumulation of detritus along the southern slope of the range. detritus ° f f the Su ^ e ! 1 l KOh ’ between Isfandak and Kalaghan, are much more altered than those of any of the ranges farther south, the shale being converted into hard slate, some of it good roofing slate, with well-marked cleavage running about east and west, with a variation of about 10 degrees north or south of the general direction The general strike of the rocks is the same, and the bedding frequently coincides with . he c eava S e ’ though the latter is often seen crossing the former. Some disturbance is evidently of posterior date to the cleavage, but, as a rule, the latter appears to hTve been contemporaneous with the upheaval of the rocks and their arrangement in thefi present almost vertical, position. No change in the character of the formation^ takes place as far Talk and precisely similar beds, alike in character strike and cleavage are seen on the road between Kalaghan and Kalpurkan. near Dizak £- f&amp;udak has a Customs Frontier Post under Slstan ”,— (Sykes, 1903.)- 262 ISF-ISM ISFANDAQEH— Elev. about 5,000/ A village and sub-district in the Kirman Province.

The Ispatld road is the one usually taken by kdfileJis and travellers from Bampur to Sarhad. It branches from the Kulanl road at Kahiri {q.v.). Leaving that place a ravine is ascended to the crest of the main range, a n ascent of 1,100 or 1,200 feet in about five miles. Thence the road descends the bed of a watercourse, which, for want of a better name, may be called the Ispatki ravine. The gradient is evidently easy, there being a descent of 600 or 700 feet in about 12 miles. Lovett, who traversed this route on the 18th February 1871, gives no particulars whatever of Ispatki itself, but it is probably a mere halting-place in the ravine, with water, firewood and camel-forage in tolerable quantities. The hills through which this march lies are composed of clays, marls, and limestones, in vertical strata, with occasional beds of sandstone. The vegetation is almost exclusively tamarisk and aloe. 1 From Ispatki to Sarbaz the road continues to descend the ravine, water being found everywhere from 5 miles below the camping ground. At 10 miles from Sarbaz (6 from Ispatki ?) date trees and cultivation commence. At 10 miles from Ispatki the ravine joins another from the north, by which the Kulani road {q.v.) descends. The two form the Sarbaz river, which is followed for 6 miles to that place. It is broad and stony, with a small perennial stream. The valley is narrow up to Sarbaz, but both the banks are cultivated. The baggage of Sir F. Goldsmid’s party (20th and 21 st February 1871) followed this route by mistake, the officers of the mission having gone by Kulani. The servants reported the road “ very good,” with the exception—and it is an important one—of two narrow gaps where the animals had to be unloaded. Lovett makes no mention of these or of the nature of the road, simply remarking that it was confined to the river-bed .—{Lovett \ Evan-Smith.) ISPID —See Isfid. ISPlDAN, or ISFIDAN, KUH— Elev. 5,547'.— (%£es.) Lofty limestone hills, nearly 60 miles east of Bampur, in Persian Balu chistan. They are part of ranges which divide the low-lying Bampur plain from the higher region about Magas, etc. Travelling westward from Magas the watershed is reached 3 miles beyond the halting-place known as Sar-i-Pahura or Sar-i-Fehruj {q.v.), that is, at about 16J miles from Magas village. This watershed appears to be rather sharply defined, but is not very elevated, being only about 5,000 feet high, that is, some 800 feet only higher than Magas. Westward, however, there is a long descent through hills to the Bampur plain, which is everywhere less than 2,000 feet above sea-level. The highest hills, as the Ispidan Kuh and the Humand peak, appear to rise from lower ground west of and apart from the watershed. This is certainly the case with Humand, but the eastern slopes of Ispidan perhaps drain towards Magas.

A mountain range in Kirman, running north-west and south-east, and forming part of the main orographic system of Persia. The name Jamal Bariz(or more properly Jabal Bariz) is applied in some maps to the whole of the great range which divides the hot country of Jiruft from the up lands of Rayin and Sarduleh, but this is erroneous, and the name is, strictly speaking, only applicable to that section of the range containing the gr?at peak Amjaz, which towers above Dusari, and separates Jiruft from the district of Bam-Narmashir. To the east of this section is the Zurnak Pass, while the prolongation of the range beyond this is termed the Shah Savaran Kuh. The drainage from the north and north-eastern slopes disappears into the Shurgaz Hdmun, while that from the southern slopes flows into the Halil Rud, and eventually into the Jaz Murian Hdmun. Some of the higher peaks reach an altitude of 15,000 feet, or perhaps more. Many of the valleys enclosed in this massive wall of mountains are rich and cultivated and have large orchards. The hillsides are thickly covered with shrubs and trees of all sorts, amongst which are fine, oak, fig, cypress, Jcassar (Pistachia terebintha), gwan (Pistachia mutica,) gisthan (Perifioca aphylla), bdddm (Nerium odor um), etc., and game is found in considerabl® quantities. Floyer, who travelled through this range in December 1876 by the Sag- dar Pass, describes his ascent from a place called Dasht-i-Kush, a small arm of the Jiruft plain, at the southern skirts of the range as follows “ On December the 5th, we started at 6-40 a.m. winding along the foot of the hills with a gradual ascent. Soon we travelled along the northern hank of a tributary of the Shur river, which, in spite of its name, was sweet enough, and, judging from the flocks of large white and black herons, con tained numerous fish. At 8-17 the Sargaz village bore 210°, distant 10 miles, and after a laborious two hours’ crossing the talus of a huge hill we turned up and a steep ascent began. The road was a shingly watercourse, flanked on either side by grand cliffs and masses of rock, sparsely covered with shrubs. I carefully observed the vegetation on this side of the range, but I never thought of finding such marked and characteristic difference between this side and the other as I did. One of the shrubs looked exactly like majguk (capital camel fodder), but it was as bitter as a bitter almond and useless to us. At 12-27 we reached the first summit, 5,770 feet across a shallow valley, and at 1 p.m. reached the second summit (barometer 24-45), 5,523 feet. There was a huge mountain on our right about 1,500 feet higher than we were covered with snow, across another valley. At 2 p.m., wereacted the third summit (barometer 24-5), 5,469 feet. Then we crossed a sheltered valley swarming with partridges. At 2-30 we forded a rapid rushing bounding torrent, which, in the reckless way it dashed itself about, seemed to harmonise well with the wild desolate grandeur of the scene around. A misty rain made everything dim and wet, and our position on the very brink of a chasm 40 feet deep was not without its difficulties. This place, Sagdar, is the usual place for halting, and two deep but low caves close by had often been used as sleeping places. There was no fodder, the only tree being an occasional ban (much resembling Pyrus ter- minalis) and the shrubs being blackberries (Sagdir in Persian) and the omnipresent bdddm. To our surprise we found little patches of soil clear ed of rocks and sown with wheat. The people, it appeared, lived in the plains during the winter, and camped here among these grand hills in the summer. ” That night the minimum the thermometer registered was 36°. We were on the march by 8 a.m., and at 8-35 reached the summit of the Ushturan Gudar, or the Camels’ Pass, called, I imagine, on the lucus a non lucendo principle, for it is fearfully steep for camels. Here the barometer showed 6,780 feet! At 9-30 we passed a sort of oasis in the endless miles of rock in the shape of the Bag-i-asp-i-Isma’il Khan. It is a large grassy mound, and it is re lated that when Isma’il Khan, father of the present Governor of Kirman, levelled and widened this road across the mountains, he personally en camped there for many days. Here the barometer showed 7,250 feet, and away to the west stretched an endless sea of mountains, range after range, gradually softening away into the distance. Higher and higher we went, the barometer at 2 p.m. showing 8,070 feet * at 2-30 p.m., 9,250 ; and at 3 p.m., 9,260 feet; while wet and dry bulbs were 49°, 51°, and a strong cold wind set in from the south-west. At 3-30 p.m. we reached our highest point, 9,310 feet, and at last saw our way before us. The road ran north down a steep short descent and lost itself in the thick oak scrub. Then far below it reappeared a dim line leading away across a broad desert plain running east and west, behind which rose a faint purple range, called the Damn hills. About 35 miles to the west, half hidden in the clouds, ran a long dark blue ridge of moun tain. This is the Sarduieh route from the low-lying Jiruft plain to the high plateau. It joins our route at Rayin, but owing to its immense altitude above the sea is only practicable in summer, when it is generally preferred as being cooler, more direct, and having two or three caravanserais. Behind, softened by thehnist, lay the ranges we had just crossed, a sea of hills, here slightly clothed with oak scrub, and spotted here and there by a tall, dark cypress tree. This is the part of the pass that gets blocked by the snow, which, as is easy to imagine, gets drifted into the ravine representing the road, and renders it impassable. At 4-30 p. m. we finally reached flat ground again at a small grassy corner of the plain, which was of course fertile just in the immediate neighbour hood of the mountain. ’ ’— {Flayer ; Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.) 2 H 2268 ' JAB—JAF JABAL BlS or BRlSG (?)

A large village in the Rudbar district of Kirman, 33£ miles east-north east of Minab, on the road to Manujan and Rigan. A village, which occupies both banks of the Manujan river, consists of a deserted fort standing about | mile from the left bank and a fluctuat ing population which has been variously estimated by different authorities at from 50 to 500 households. It probably varies largely according to the season of the year. The village possesses 60 ploughs, for each of which 11 Indian maunds of seed are sown, and two crops are raised annually one of wheat or barley, and one of tall millet, besides a little henna and indigo. Irrigation is from the Manujan river. Chiraghabad, 3 miles to the south-east, is also cultivated by the inhabitants of Jaghin. The inhabitants in 1899 owned 300 cattle, 20 camels and 50 donkeys, and also formerly possessed 6,000 goats, but a Bashakardi raid in 1898 reduced the number of the latter to 1,000. In addition to the ordinary route from Manujan to Minab, which passes through Jaghin, and which has been traversed by Persian wheeled artillery, three other roads lead from the Manujan plain to the Jaghin plain, viz (1) The route taken by Jennings in 1885, vide Route Book Vol ' I No. 139. (2) Tne road through the gorge some 2 miles to the east, by which Daffa- dar Sardar Khan came.

JAGIN (River)— A river in Bashakard, which rises in the Band-i-Marz, and draining the west central portion of the district, empties itself into the Persian Gulf. Considerable doubt exists at to the exact course of this river, owing partly to the small extent to which this part of the country has been explored, and partly to the habit obtaining in Persia of giving the sane stream a different name in the various districts through which it flews. For the first portion of its course it flows east-south-east, more or less parallel to the Band-i-Marz, and between that range and the Band-i-Nashki; east of Anguranit turns southwards, and roughly maintains that direc tion for the remainder of its course. It receives numerous tributaries, the most important of which, perhaps, is the Sharifi, which, coming from the north-west, joins it at Sapinchi. At Buding, where the river is crossed by the Jashk-Anguran road, it is 60 yards wide, and 2 feet 6 inches deep, with a current of 3 miles an hour. At this point the banks are sloping and stony, and the stream is said to be unfordable for a week at a time in the rainy season.—-(AMey and Massy, 1894.)

Sinking here into the ground, it comes to the surface again in the Mashlud date-groves, 30 miles away to the east, on the edge of the « and would probably be found a few feet below the surface in any part of the intervening plain. y In the Jalk oasis are several domed buildings, mainly built of sun-dried tllougl1 known locally as the tombs of the Kaianian Maliks probably belong to members of the Saffar family, who ruled for more than nve centuries m Baluchistan—from about A.D. 867 to A.D. 1400 Among the date-groves are ten villages, arranged in two rows from west to east. In the southern row are— (1) Sir dak, 10 houses. (2) Sar-i-Kuh, 100 houses and fort. (3) Gitanuk, 15 houses. (4) Shishriz, 200 houses and fort.generations by members of the same family, one of them succeeding to the Governorship of Kej, when Ahmad Shah, Durani, held sway at Kabul. In 1737 Nadir Shah seized Kandahar, and at the same time sent a detachment of his army, under Generals Pir Muhammad Khan and Latif ’All Khan— both Kajars—to Jalk. At this period Mir ’Abdulla Khan I was only ten years of age, his father having but lately died. The headmen of Jalk assembled, and collecting several valuable presents, went out to pay their respects to the two generals, but owing to the tender years of their sardar they did not take him with them. The generals were incensed at the non-appearance of the boy, and refusing the presents, ordered him to be brought before them. The headmen begged that he should not be summoned as he 'was but a boy. The generals replied : “ Then bring his mother Bibi Chandan ” (by name). But she declined to come, saying she was pardanashin (a woman who does not appear unveiled before men, excepting near relatives). This further incensed the two generals, and all Jalk assembled to give battle to the Persian army. A great and bloody conflict ensued, the result being that the whole of the Buzurgzadehs—men, women, and children,—excepting one woman named ShahrBanu, and Mir ’Abdulla Khan and his younger brother Nawab Khan, were massacred. These three were the only survivors of the Buzurg zadehs then in Jalk. Nawab Khan had been carried off to Kej before the battle (how Shahr Banu escaped is not stated) ; while Mir ’Abdulla Khan was carried back a prisoner to Kandahar, together with several Hindus and Arbabis. At sight of the boy. Nadir Shah’s pity was kindled, and he released him as w T ell as the other prisoners, and sent them back to Jalk in safety. From this time onwards, Jalk andKalaghan continued to pay a yearly cash revenue of Ks. 600 to Kandahar. Mir ’Abdulla I in due course died, and was succeeded by his son, Mir Haidar Shah. The latter ruled but for a short time, and on his death was succeeded by his son, Mir ’Abdulla II. A short time after the latter had succeeded tc the Jalk sardarship, ShaK Mihrab, Baranzai Kiyani,* a resident of Dizak, was appointed Governor of Bampur by order of the Shah ; and he was directed to march against Jalk and compel Mir’Abdulla II to pay revenue to Persia, acknowledge the Shah as his suzerain, and give up his allegiance to Kandahar. Mir ’Abdulla declined, stating he was a subject of the Amir of Afghanis tan. A battle ensued between the Persian troops under Shah Mihrab, on the one side, and the people of Jalk and Kalaghan, under Mir ’Abdulla II, on the other. Mir ’Abdulla was killed, and his people utterly routed, while J alk and Kalaghan were formally annexed by Persia. This was some 80 years ago. Owing to internal troubles in Afghanistan, no help was sent from that quarter, and no attempt has since been made by that country to re-conquer these districts. * The KiyanL are the second dynasty of the Shahs of Persia. 611. B. 2,1274 JAL-JAL Mir ’Abdulla II was succeeded in the sardarship by Mir Navab Khan. The latter was a son of Mir Isa, who was a great-grandson of Mir Mihrab Khan, the fourth sardar of Jalk. At this period Mir Alam Khan (father of Sardar Dilavar Khan, of Dizak) conspired with Mir Gajian, Naushirvani (the father of Shirdil Khan, of Kalaghan, and own brother of the famous Sardar Azad of Kharan)to depose Mir Navab, and being successful, they killed him. This treachery appears all the blacker, as Mir Navab’s wife was Mir Gajian’s sister. On Mir Navab’s assassination, the people of Jalk elected Mir Maddat Khan, son of Mir ’Abdulla II, as sardar. He, in revenge for the death of his cousin, killed Mir Gajian. Sardar Azad Khan of Kharan, on hearing of the assassination of his brother, marched an army of Naushirvanis against Mir Maddat Khan to exact vengeance. Mir Maddat Khan being quite helpless and unable to cope -with Azad Khan, gave BalaKalat (the then largest village of Kalaghan, vide account of that district) to Azad Khan in settlement of the blood-feud, and the latter returned to Kharan, no blood having been shed. Shortly after this, Mir Alam Khan succeeded is seizing Mir Maddat Khan by treachery, and sent him to Bampur, where he eventually died as a prisoner. Mfr Alam Kh an then seized Jalk, which, together with Kalaghan he constituted as part and parcel of his own district of Dizak, and since that time they have formed simply sub-districts of the latter. Thus Mir Alam Khan was the tenth hakim of Jalk, and the fifth hakim of Dizak, i.e., since the time of Niamatullah (see account of Dizak), and this was the first time that one man ruled both Dizak and Jalk. After the blood-feud between the now deposed Mir Maddat Khan and Sardar Azad Khan, by the cession to the latter of Bala Kalat, a great friendship had sprung up between these sardars, and in consequence Azad Khan was much enraged at the seizure and deposition of Mir Maddat Kh m, especially so, as Mir Alam Khan refused to recognize his rqht to Bala Kalat. The result was that Azad Khan marched an army against Kalaghan, raided that district, and partially destroyed the fort of Lrji. This happened about 1857 A.D. From that period till his death, Mir ’Alam Khan resided in Dizak and his son Sardar Dilavar Khan in Jalk. whence he, under his father, ruled that place as well as Kalaghan. On Mir ’Alam Khan being gathered to his fathers, Dilavar Khan succeed ed him and took up his residence at Dizak, while he in his turn has been succeeded by his son Mjr ’Abdulla Khan, who was sardar in 1902, under the nominal overlordship of the Governor-General of Persian Baluchistan, . The authority of the latter, however, in the outlying border districts of his province, is a very shadowy one, and can usually only be insisted on by force. In 1902, Persian troops, visited Jalk and destroyed the forts of Hushab and Dashtak, but on the advice of Major Showers, the Political Agent of Kalat, left those of Kuhkan and Shishriz untouched. ^ It may here be mentioned that in 1896 a Boundary Commission under Colonel Sir Thomas Holdich, visited Jalk, and delimitated the frontier east of that place, by which the much disputed date-groves of Mashkid fell212 JAL—JAM 275 within the British borders. In 1902, Major Showers, with an escort of Indian troops passed through here en route to Ladis.— {Jennings, 1885 ; Holdich, 1901 ; Sykes, 1902 ; Showers, 1902 ; Hogg, 1909.) JALK BAND (Persian Baluchistan)— A range of hills, an eastern spur of the great Slaneh Kuh.—{Jennings.) JALLABl— Elev. 45'. A village in the Bandar Abbas district, 33 miles from the town of that name, on the road to Minab. It consists of about 50 huts, surrounded by about 4 square miles under barley (most of which is sent to Bandar Abbas), and a well of excellent water. When Grey passed through in August 1905, the place was tem porarily deserted, the inhabitants having gone to Minab for the date season, but at normal times some supplies would probably be procurable. The village. possesses 30 camels, 50 cattle, and about 130 sheep and goats. Fuel and camel-grazing abundant.— {Grey, 1905.) JAMAL BARIZ— See Jabal Bariz. JAMALI— Lat. 28° 55' 5'; Long. 58° 37' 30'- Elev. 2,900'. A village in Kirman, Persia, 24 miles south-east of Bam, situated in a very fertile tract in the highest state of cultivation, and intersected in every direction by running streams.— (St. John \ Pottinger.) There are supplies of all sorts here, and a fort.— (St. John ; Goldsmid.) JAMBKl (Persian Baluchistan) — A range of hills near Bahu Kalat in Persian Baluchistan. Its highest peaks are about 2,500 feet.-^—-($£. John.) JAMBKl (Pass)— A wide pass on the road from Kashi and Karvan to Bmt in Persian Balh- chistan. It is apparently a sort of gap between the western end of the Band-i- Shariki range on the right and a low hog-backed hill on the left, and is pass ed at about 10| miles from camp on the Sartapi river {q.v.), going north wards. The word “Jambkl” means “forked.” There is a slight descent from the pass, and at about 21 miles from the fork a magnificent view of the Gidich valley suddenly breaks upon the traveller. The Gidich river (q.v.) is reached at 14 miles.-—(Fku/er.) JAMCHIN— A patch of cultivation in Sarhad, 44 miles from Varaj, on the Kuh-i- Chehil Tan.— (Sykes, 1893.) JAMP— See Champ. JAMGLl— Elev. 1,551'. A hamlet and camping-ground in Kirman, 89 miles south-west of Rigan on the caravan route from there to Minab. It consisted formerly of a few scattered palm-leaf huts occupied by pastoral Baluchis, and ten wells, but when Grey passed through, in September 1905, the place was deserted, and the wells had not been cleaned out for two years. The camping-ground is in a dense jungle extending for miles on every side. All this jungle is liable to inundation, being a depression in the desert. Here are miles of green grass 18 inches high ; kahur trees 2 feet in diameter;h age tamarisks ; her trees, etc. Sweet water is obtainable everywhere in this jungle at a depth of some 18 feet from the surface.— (Jennings, 1885 ; Napier, 1899 ; Grey, 1905.) JA MURZ— A hamlet in Makran, 14 miles north of Fanuch, on the road to Bazman. There are no supplies ; water is obtained from a qandt. — (Brazier-Creagh, 1893, from native information.) JAUDAR HILLS— The Jaudar hills are in the Kirman district of Persian Baluchistan. The Kirman Kaur (q.v) up which lies Floyer’s route from Kashi to Birt come through-them from the north. They are entered at 23 miles from Kashi.— (Floyer.) JARUFT— Lat. ; Long. ; Elev. A plain in Kirman, Persia, about 60 miles south of Bam. It is a warm tract of plain country, lying between parallel ranges north and south, many parts of which are clothed with low jungle. As it possesses a mild climate and abundant pasturage, it is resorted to in winter by many small tribes who occupy the mountain districts at other seasons. It possesses only four or five collections of huts, which can be termed villages, each possessing a small mud fort as a place of refuge, but seldom inhabited : these are Sarjaz, Du Siar or Sarah, Kaleh Nau, Kaleh Pish. The rest of its unsettled popu lation reside in little groups scattered over the plain. The heat is so great in summer and the flies so numerous that it is almost wholly deserted by the tribes, who return to the mountains of Jamal Bariz. The lands yield grain, millet, pulse, beans, rice, cotton, henna, palma-christi, and dates ; and some parts are of great fertility ; from five to thirty fold being spoken of as the return for barley and wheat. In the middle of January when Abbott visited it, green crops of barley, high enough to be cut for the food of cattle, were standing in the fields. Sheep, goats and horned cattle, and their produce, butter and wool, are advantageously purchased here. The flocks yield lambs twice a year. The regular revenue is btated to be about £1,450, but is nearly doubled by local impositions. The jungle and reeds with which this plain is clothed in parts abound with game, such as the francolin, the partridge, known as Jarufti (perdrix Pondicereanus), and the wild hog. The boiling point of water on this plain is 209°, and the thermometer at 10 a.m. on 22nd January was 81° in a tent and at noon 86°. Floyer in 1876. says that the whole of this fertile plain is inhabited at, from a rough estimate, the rate of about a village of two hundred people to every 10 miles square. Carpets are made in the villages in this plain, but the patterns are all simple zig-zag, and the colours not brilliant. (Abbott ; Kinnier ; Floyer.) JASHJUNA or OLD JASHK— Lat. 25° 38' 50' ; Long. 57° 46' 40'. The administrative capital of the Jashk district and residence of the chiefs ; it is situated 7 miles north of New Jashk and 1 mile inland from the shore of Jashk West Bay. The village is completely sorrounded with date- groves. It extends over a square mile. The chief points of interest are the ruins of a Portuguese fort, which is a mere debris of ruined walls, saidJAS—JAS '277 to have been battered down by Mir Yusuf, with an old gun lying half buried in the ground: and a ziarat called Shah Mar dan, which is much frequented by Baluchis. There are about 10 mud houses and 150 mat huts. Some of the houses are of a fair size, and there is a house of considerable preten sions belonging to Muhammad Sahib. The population may be estimated at 800 souls, of whom rather more than half are Baluchis ; the remainder are Shaikhs, Jats and slaves. There are extensive date plantations and sufficient fields for the needs of the inhabitants. Dates, wheat and arzun are cultivated, and to a lesser extent cotton and barley. The village possesses 200 camels, 50 donkeys, 60 cattle and 300 sheep and goats. Water is from two wells, 8 feet deep, and is muddy but sweet. The inhabitants are chiefly agriculturists, except some weavers called Julahag. They deal also in carpets called zilii and JchirsaJc, date-mats called talc, firewood and ghi, which they export to Qishm island and to the Arabian coast, specially Batinah, their trade relations being chiefly with these places and with the Persian districts of Bashakard and Minab. Boats are obliged to anchor, about 1,000 yards from the shore, as the bay is very shallow. The trade with Masqat is now insignificant. Some silk embroidery is done by the women and fishing nets are made. The administration is noticed in the article on Jashk district. There is good partridge shooting, and some hares are obtainable.— (Lorimer, 1906 ; Craufurd, 1910.) JASKNAUorNEW JASK— A port of Persian Makran and station of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; it is situated on the promontory which ends south-westwards in Jask point and lies about 140 miles southeast of Bandar Abbas, 145 miles north-north-east of Masqat and 290 miles west by north of Gwadar, History .— The telegraph station at Jask was established in 1862. In 1879 a guard of Indian Infantry was provided. This garrison was raised in 1911 owing to threats of attack on the part of Afghans, who had been foiled in their attempt to obtain arms. In 1913 the detachment of Indian infantry was reduced from about 230 to only 40 with one British officer. In 1912 Mir Barkat Khan, who had identified himself with the traffic in arms murdered an old mulla in old Jask ; but in 1913 he found it did not pay to remain in revolt, and offered to submit and settle his feud with Mir Haji, the Persian Governor. Descri'ption .— The Jask peninsula divides Jask East Bay on the one side, from Jask West Bay on the other, and is itself nearly cut off from the mainland by a winding creek which runs inland from the western bay at a place 3| miles northwards from the tip of the promontory. The land on which new Jask stands is low ; the upper stratum consists of a loose sand mixed with clay, and the sub-stratum of hard calcareous matter, chiefly a shelly conglo merate. The extremity of the Jask peninsula is called Jask-i-Sar; it has a small tomb about 15 feet above sea-level, which is called Shaikh Sa’id, Hindi, and is an occasional object of pilgrimage. The peninsula has two other small points not far from Jask-i-Sar upon its eastern side ; the nearer to Jask-i-Sar is called Damilan, and the other Kurazi. A quarter of a mile to the north of the tomb are the telegraph buildings and British military barracks, and at a similar distance beyond them again, upon the“lEore ot tiie West J3ay, is the ordinary landing-place adjoined by a mud fort, which is the property of the Persian Government, and being no longer re quired for executive or military purposes is now occupied by the local Direc tor of Customs. Still further north, on the west side of the promontory, begins a date-grove called Maksa, a mile in extent. There is also a large mansion with b dglrs owned by a private merchant, but sometimes used for the accommodation of persons subject to quarantine. New Jask is divided into two parts, namely the European station, with a native settlement depending on it, and a Persian village which surrounds the Persian fort. Clima'e .—The climate of the place is extreme, the thermometer, which may fall to 43-37° Fahrenheit in winter, sometimes rises to 110° in summer. i — and the heat is rendered more trying by the moistness of the atmosphere, the mean humidity of which exceeds 70 per cent, of saturation. The pre vailing winds are easterly, but in winter a north-west wind frequently blows. Winds are usually strongest in the afternoon. Sandstorms are of frequent occurrence, and during their continuance the air is heavily charged with a fine red dust. Malarial fever is prevalent in the cold weather. The normal rainfall is about 4| inches per annum. The mean normals of temperature, etc., extracted from the Meteorological Month. Max. Min. Wind. Rain.

Mos quito curtains should be provided, although not absolutely necessary. Population. In the European station reside all the members of the telegraph estab lishment, with their families and servants. The Persian village consists of 45 mud houses and date-leaf huts ; it is inhabited by Baluchis, Saiyids, Mulais, Raisis, Maids who are fishermen, and Negroes who are either labourers or domestic slaves. In addition to these there are some natives of the Minab district and other Persians, also a large number of half-breeds of various kinds. Except the Persians all the inhabit ants are Sunnis, and of these two sects are represented, the Baluchis- being Hanafis, and the Saiyids Sha ’fis. The Persian, Baluchi, Arabic, and Hindustani languages are all spoken and some of the people understand a little English. The inhabitants of the native village are mostly traders, agriculturists, graziers and fishermen, about a dozen Persian coolies could be found to assist in unloading vessels, but there is seldom any demand for their services. Resources. Water, which is brackish, is from wells, the best being situated 1 mile north-east of the telegraph station : rain water also is stored in tanks near the telegraph buildings. Water is always scarce, and is not capable of improvement except by condensing. Supplies .—Crops are not raised on any large scale, being confined to a few cultivated patches which barely supply sufficient for the modest requirements of the few inhabitants. Corn is sometimes brought in by2V camels from the Minab District, but the demand is small. There are no bazars The inhabitants subsist on dates and fish, and cannot afford meat winch latter is very scarce indeed. The telegraph staff grow their own vegetables, but owing to the brackish water, they do not thrive. Tomatoes cabbages, turnips, beetradishes and cauliflowers mature in October Indian vegetables and melons in March. There is a good piece of land about D nules north-east of the telegraph buildings, some 3 acres in extent, which could be devoted to growing vegetables. Fruit is not obtainable’locally Milk is not drunk to any extent by the inhabitants. Probably about 40 or 50 cows could, with a month’s notice, be bought in the interior at a price varying from 50-60 rupees each, but grazing is a difficulty. Fish is obtainable at times, but only in a very limited quantity. Food-stuffs and even vegetables during the recent bad agricultural years have been mostly imported from India and Bandar ’Abbas Live-stock amounts to about 200 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. Foefe—Mangrove is obtainable for camels about 2 miles north-east of the telegraph station, but grazing for other animals is not to be had in the neighbourhood, and animals would have to be sent many miles inland to meet with even scant grazing. Fuel .—There are no coal-stores. Some 15 donkey loads of brushwood per day could be procured from the vicinity of old Task, 12 miles distant. The price normally ruling is annas 5 per donkey load of about Jbs. 89. Transport. There being no fodder, there are no transport animals and some of the residents who own camels keep them at old Task. No caravans visit Jask. With a week’s notice about 100 camels and 50 donkeys could be collected, with a month’s notice probably 5 times this number would be available. Trade .—A formerly considerable trade, especially by the Saiyids, in goods imported from Karachi and Bombay, has declined since the establishment of the Persian Customs post. No statistics of the volume of the trade are avail able, but its character may be inferred from the remarks on trade in the arti cle on Persian Makran. Military. Defences .—Jask telegraph station has been placed in a proper state of defence. The old Persian fort is situated on the flank of the line of advance of an enemy attacking from the land side. During a threatened Afghan attack in April 1908, this fort was occupied by a naval force and a gun. A trench was run across the promontory about 250 yards in advance of the telegraph station, and manned by the Indian infantry guard. Gun-boats in the west and east bays can command with their fire any advance against this position. The slope of the shore on the eastern side of the promontory would afford cover, from the westward, to a small force advancing along the beach with the intention of enfilading the defences ; but it would come under fire were a gun-boat stationed in the eastern anchorage. For the protection of the place a detachment of 40 sepoys of the Indian Army under a British officer with 2 maxims are posted at New Jask, and are23 t' 14 “ s capable of containin « doubk — andlomfiotp r t b !i Ie ab . out f, 00 ' stron g&gt; armed with Martini rifles .l ome , 1 ?&gt; 0 1 00 . cartridges, together with daggers, could possibly be not together, but their military value as soldiers is negligible. ^ ^ Harbour. New Task is a fortnightly place of call for the steamers of the British India Company and is the chief port of Persian Makran after Chahbar There are anchorages suitable for steam-vessels on both sides of the Task promontory, m which shelter can be found from all but southerly ^df With normal weather ships m variably anchor in the west bay and only frequent the east bay when, owing to the prevalence of a “ shamal ” (strony north-west wind), landing in small boats would become dangerous in thf west bay Ships usually anchor miles from the shore in the west bay but in the east bay they approach to within § mile of the shore and anchor 1 mile from the telegraph station and east of the telegraph cable. The 5- fathom line is 2, miles from the shore in the west bay and | mile from the shore in the east bay. In neither bay is the anchorage ever dangerous with any ™&lt;i, and it is simply for convenience of landing with small boats that ships select the west or east bay. An unlimited number of ocean-gohm steamers of the British-India type could anchor in either bay • there ar? no fixed moorings for such vessels. There is no bar at the entrance of either Native boats, at high tide only, use the creek 3 miles north of the tele graph station. The course of this creek is winding, its length I or 5 miles and it always has some depth of water inside, but at low tide the bar is almost dry. Landing. Landing could be effected at any point of the coast in either the east or west bay The shore is composed of mud and soft sand, in most places gently shelving. With the normal breezes prevailing, the surf would not be heavy, but during a shamal ” (common from October to March) or strong south-west breeze, landing from small boats would be dangerous in the west bay, but comparatively easy in the east bav. Supplies would have to be carried through the surf. . A 1 bout ^ m i le s of shore in either bay is available, but the usual landing place is about f mile from the head of the promontory in the west bay. Tides. The spring tides rise 9 feet, and the neaps probably 6 to 7 feet The tides do not run strong enough to interfere with landing in boats, and there are no dangerous currents. Boats. Six native vessels {baghaleh) ranging from 18 to 28 tons’ burden and trading only to the Arabian coast, belong to this port. (The natives often carry their boats across the spit of sand separating the two bays ) Pierg. There are no wharfs, and stone is the only material available for the construction of such. There are no arrangements for landing cattle horses or camels. &amp; * Camping ground. The best site on which to encamp troops would be upon ground embracing 30 acres or more east of the telegraph garden and sepoy’s lines Here the soil is hard being a mixture of sand and fossilised shells, but there are no roads, and the water-supply is brackish and extremely scarce. Store Depots. The existing buildings which could probably on emer- g ency be allotted for the storage of supplies are :--an old Pers ia fort in ruinscontaining 24 small rooms and 2 larger rooms intended for about 100 Persian soldiers and 1 officer, about 50 yards from the landing place, and separated therefrom by a strip of sand: the telegraph buildings containing 18 large vJ ; rooms (32'' X15') and six smaller rooms (32'x 8') situated 250 yards from the seashore and some 400 yards from the landing place: and the sepoys’ barracks with accommodation for 100 sepoys and 2 native officers together with a guard room and small hospital. The Persian fort is in ruins and would require tarpaulins on the roof. A dminis [ratio n . The head of the telegraph station is also political representative of the British Government at New Jask and as such exercises jurisdiction over British subjects, and deals with the Persian officials and local authorities, under the orders of his superior, the Director at Karachi. The Persian Imperial Customs establishment consists of a Mudir and 4 armed guards, locally recruited. The Mudir has his abode in the Persian fort near the landing-place. Apart from these Customs employes the Persian Government has no agents at Jask. The quarantine arrangements are in charge of a British medical officer of the telegragh station, on behalf of the Persian Government-. Authority over Persian subjects in the settlement is exercised by the Mirs of Old Jask whose position is described in the article on Jask district. Currency, etd —The local weights, measures and money in use are the same as those at Bandar ’Abbas. There are no Banks or Bankers’ Agents or European firms. Communications, Posts. —There are no land postal arrangements, but British India mail steamers call here on the inward and outward voyage on alternate weeks. Telegra'phs. —The telegraph station is an important one. The staff consists of 10 or 12 European clerks under a Superintendent or Assistant Superintend ent and there is an Assistant Surgeon in medical charge of the establish ment. The inspecting officer of the land-line from Gwadar to New Jask also has his head-quarters here. The Jask office is connected with Karachi by a cable ; with Chahbar, Gwadar, Pasni, Ormara, and Karachi by a two-wire land-line ; with Masqat by a cable ; and with Bushire by two cables, one of which runs direct, and the other via Han jam. The principal instrument is generally in use for the direct transmission of messages between Karachi and Tehran, the current being reinforced at Jask and again at Bushire : from 500 to 1,000 messages pass in the 24 hours, in one direction by day, and in the other by night, this being arranged in alteranation with another line. The telegraph office and quarters form three blocks of substantial and commodious flat-roofed buildings. There is a wireless installation at Jask for use in connection with the arms traffic blockade. It is also open for public messages. There are no roads worth the name at Jask. The only suitable materials for making roads are stones which could be procured in limited quantities from the east and south beaches. {Gabriel, 1907 ; Craujurd, 1910.)

A barren group of hills, of which the highest point is 3,048 feet. The range runs for a few miles both west and south-south-east from this peak. The strata appear to be inclined upwards from west to east. On the seaward slopes of the range is a remarkable rock- pillar of natural origin. These hills are divided from the rest of the coast range by the Tavarkand stream on the west and the Beh- madi stream on the east.t a !St ids a ile :r- 'a- sill A la in in - !■ on k im nds to - 'ck- ? in. ■oin ng &amp; earn kb it.

The hill is quoin-shaped with a sheer fall to west ward : the precipices are of a yellow colour. As seen . from New Jashk, it some what resembles the Rock of Gibraltar. Kvaik stream. Comes down in a west-south-westerly direction from a few miles inland and reaches the sea a mile or two west of Old Jashk. Towards the coast, the bed of this torrent is 200 yards wide and the banks 40 feet high. There is good but scanty water in wells. Jashk stx-eam.

Rises in the Basha- kard district, nearly 80 miles from the coast and reaches the sea 45 (?) miles east of New Jashk. Rises 70 miles from the coast in the Bashakard dis trict and reaches the sea 60 miles east of New Jashk. A river near the coast which is dry in summer and autumn, but after heavy rain becomes impassable and over flows its banks. Or dinarily it is a rapid stream 50 yards wide and 3 feet deep with banks 20 feet high, which are in places -i mile apajt. The water is good. A river somewhat resembling the Jagin but with low banks which at 10 miles from the coast are | mile apart. A large river which overflows its east bank in the mari time plain during high rises. The water is sweet. At 4 miles from the sea, the Sadaich re ceives a tributary called the Haimin, on its right bank, and at 6 miles from the sea another called the Gilik on its left; the latter has a tributary called the Raiku, which enters it on its left bank, 5 miles from its junction with the Sadaich. These smaller streams contain water after rain only and their banks are low and ill-defined. Remaeks. The river is sometimes im passable for 5 or 6 and even for 10 to 15 days. In the plain there is a thick belt of tamarisk and acacia jungle on both banks. Near its mouth are two man grove swamps called Janakani and Nazai sepa rated by a plain 7 miles wide. The chiefs are said to derive revenue from the creek formed by the mouth of the river. They impose dues on the boats which call to collect man groves. After entering the mari time plain this river has a sandy bottom abound ing in quicksands and the banks are lined with tama risks and acacias. Between the Jagin and Gab- rig rivers is another smaller stream called the Sir am oh. The mouth of this river is a tidal creek with a shallow bar; the coast on the east side of it is swampy and on the west bare white sandhills, called Surap, in which water can be obtained by digging, extend along the beach for 6 miles. sJAS-JAS Name.

This stream has a number of small tributaries, it is dry except after heavy rain. —— uj. puybioux coniormation, we may note that the coast of the Jashk district is in general low and marshy. From Ras-al* Kuh to the mouth of the Jashk creek the shore consists of a narrow strip of sand, in places bearing tufts of grass, which has mangrove swamps behind. ^ and in places is penetrated by inlets, Khur Hamid, 9 miles east of Ras-al-Kuh, being the most considerable and to some extent frequented by boats. At New Jashk there is a short interval of well-defined coast; and east of this again mangrove swamps, with creeks which are visited only for fish- ing and cutting firewood, resume their course, till the Surap sandhills are reached near the mouth of the Sadaich river. Population. Tire inhabitants of the Jashk district are comprised in the population described in the general article on the coast of Persian Makram ihe Hdts may be regarded as the dominant tribe, inasmuch as the chiefs are of their number. JThe total population (including hill-villages) is roughly estimated at 22,000 souls, the fighting strength of the first line, that is of men armed with modern rifles at 500, and that of the second line at 3,000. The population of the coastal strip with which we are concerned is about 9,000 souls. Agriculture, live*stock and fisheries :—For general information under these heads the Persian Makran article may be consulted. Additional details will be found in the topographical table at the end of the present article. Trade, communication, supplies and transport—TY lz reader is referred to the remarks under these heads in the articles on Persian Makran and New Jashk and to the topographical table at the end of this article. Administration: Jashk district is governed on the same general principles as the other . districts of Persian Makran described in the article on that region. There are two joint chiefs or Mirs of Jashk, Mustafa Khsn and Mir Hdti who reside at Old Jashk and are relations : the former is the principal chief. These chiefs belong to the Hot tribe. No tribute is pay able by them to the Persian Government, but they collect for their own benefit several taxes, notably a general land-tax which produces about 1,500 tumans per annum, a poll-tax of 10 hrdns yearly on all men of substance and traders, a poll-tax of 2 riydls a year on male adults in the villages of Luran, Behai and Kuh Mubarak and a tithe or Dahyakr on grain produce and dates. In the fishing season they also receive 10 riydls on account of every fishing boat and take annually 15 camels under the Baluchi title of Gurjawl. Some of the slaves of the chief com stitute a sort of police force. The political institution of the greatest importance in the district is the British telegraph station described in the article on New Jashk.

It is said to be the fourth stage from Ramishk to Rigan.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894, from native information.) JAZ MURGHAB— A village in Kirman near Shahabad (q.v.). J4Z MURlAN HAMUN—- It may here be remarked that in several dialects of Baluchi, also in Kurdi, “gaud” and “zireh,” and “hamun ” all possess identically the same meaning, viz., ‘ ‘ low, level ground surrounded on all sides by somewhat higher ground. ’ * As a rule, all large hamuns receive rivers of sweet water, but their banks are unapproachable for miles owing to deposits of salt (wet salt and sand, called “kalar ” in Sind and the Punjab), while generally after rain these hdmuns are immense salt lakes covered with rushes, grass, and water-fowl. These hdmuns receive drainage from all four directions, and their waters never reach the sea. The Jaz Murian Hdmim lies between Bampur and Khanh, and receives the drainage of the Bampur, Halil, Kahn Rud and Kuhistani Rivers ; also the drainage from the northern slopes of the Aspan Kuh, Ramishk Kuh, Patarun Kuh and Marz Kuh ; as well as that from the south-western slopes of the range running south-east from the Jabal Bariz range. Its extent as shown on the map is misleading. The swamp ground is locally called sarog or kalar (soft sand and salt), and the entire ground between Kalanzau on the east and Zeh Kalut on the west is liable to inundation during the rains. Between these two spots is the actual limit of the swamp, making it some 50 miles by 20. Sykes states that there are two separate “ chils ” (ponds in which water is collected before being run off into the fields) called Milan and Jihun respectively, from which, by error, Jennings named the whole hamun, which is really only known as the Jaz Murian or Haunt of Birds. It is a sweet water lake, in which the water remains permanently only between Kalanzau and Gumbaz. During and after the rains there is a large swamp in the vicinity of Jaa Murian, but in the hot weather it is mostly dried up. The fact that all the Jcdfilek routes converge on Kalanzau and Zeh Kalut, goes to prove that its length of over 100 miles, as given on the map, is erroneous.— {Jennings, 1885 ; Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.)

It runs eastward. 2K2292 JEH—JIR From here low ranges, Baggink, Gasumal, and Band-i-Lagi are about 3 miles east. The route here lies over hard gravelly and sandy plains, thinly covered with jungle.— (Floyer.) JIAND— A well in Sarhad, 3 miles north-west of Nudu, on the road from Ladgasht to Ladis. The water is fairly plentiful and good.— (Showers, 1902.) JljlAN or JlJUN— A village in Qishm island (q.v.). j Iruft— A small district and plain consisting of the upper reaches of the Halil Bud. It is bounded on the east and north by the Jabal Bariz range, which running up to 15,000 feet in height divides the hot country of Jiruft from the cold uplands of Rayin and Sarduieh and Narmashir. The district in 1903 yielded a revenue of 13,000 tumdns. At one period it was famous for its wealth (vide Bag-i-Yanus), its silk trade alone paying £25,000 yearly in customs dues, but now it is mostly inhabited by nomads the chief tribe of which is the Vali Oshaghi, though there are representatives also of the MehnI, Sardul, Jabal Barizi, Lar and Afshar tribes. The plain is about 30 miles broad and is intersected by the Halil Rud or Haliri river, which eventually loses itself in the Jaz Murian Hdmun. It is bounded on the north-east by the Jabal Bariz range, on the west by the Suleman Kuh and Isfandaqeh hills, and on the north by the lofty Sarduieh and Divan-i-Murad hills, to the south it is open and stretches away towards Rudbar. As it possesses a mild climate and abundant pasturage, it is resorted to in winter by many small tribes who occupy the mountain districts at other seasons. The heat is so great in summer and the flies so numerous, that it is almost wholly deserted by the tribes, who return to the moun tains of Jabal Bariz. The lands yield grain, millet, pulse, beans, rice, cotton, henna, and dates ; and some parts are of great fertility; from five to thirty fold being spoken of as the return for barley and wheat. In the middle of January, when Abbott visited it, green crops of barley, high enough to be cut for the food of cattle, were standing in the fields. Sheep, goats, and horned cattle, and their produce, butter and wool, are advantageously pur chased here. The flocks yield lambs twice a year. The jungle and reeds with which this plain is clothed in parts abound with game, such as the francolin, the partridge, known _ as jarufti (Perdrix 'pondicereanus) and the wild hog. The boiling point of water on this plain is 209° and the thermometer at 10 a.m. on 22nd January was 81° in a tent and at noon 86°. Floyer in 1876 says that the whole of this fertile plain is inhabited, from a rough estimate, at the rate of about a village of 200 people to every 10 miles square. Carpets are made in the villages in this plain, but the patterns are all simple zigzag, and the colours are not brilliant.JIR—JUL 293 The plain of Jiruft 18 important; the richness of its soil and the quality of its crops could be vastly increased.

KAFANU— A valley in the Kirman district, situated in the heart of the hills under Kuh-i-Lalehzar, 9 miles south of Aru, on the Ki man-Bandar Abbas road. It is watered by several streams and at a mile from its northern entrance once stood a serai, which collapsed under snow in the winter of 1894. The snow lies very heavily here, and in sheltered parts was still half a foot deep in April 1894.^ This place has an evil reputation, from the number of kdfilehs which have been overwhelmed here—hence its name the “ Val ley ol Funerals.” . The valley is about a mile broad, and, coming from the north, the ascent to the pass continues for about 2 miles, when an elevation of about 9,290 feet is reached. The southern descent is gradual and easy. Sykes says that the pass could easily be kept open all the year round, but as the nomads desert the highlands, there are no villages where the caravans can purchase supplies, nor any organization for clearing away or beating down the snow. The villages in the Kafanu valley, therefore, except Kaleh-i-Asghar (q.v.), are only inhabited in the summer.—( Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.)f 296 KAF—KiAH KAFANU KtJH (Kirman)— A range of hills in the vicinity of the Sardhieh Kuh.— (Jennings.)

The Kair and Bir rivers run southwards from the hills across the plains to the sea. They will be found described under their own names. It is uncertain whether there are permanent settlements of Kair and Bir. KAIR RIVER, or KAUR-I-KlR— A considerable stream in Persian Baluchistan which drains the Geh dis trict, and descending in a general southerly course to the coast plains falls into the sea by two mouths, of which the eastern is on Puzim Bay, 28 miles west by north of Chahbar and the other 18 miles further to westward on the east side of Tank point. The village of Tank is situated on the right bank of the western branch, about 3 miles from the coast, and the village of Kair is scattered on both banks of the eastern branch at about 7 miles from the sea. The district of the delta is called Kair and is cultivated to a considerable extent. Near the town of Geh {q.v.) three watercourses unite, and run south for about 10 miles, when they are joined by theHichan Kaur, which appears to be the main stream.I - 300 kai-kaj T • -Wo tW this channel receives the drainage of the eastern part It is possible that this cha _ r a ter eourse of Bampur.

KAJO or DASHTIARI (River)— A river in Makran, rising in the Lashar range, where the watershed divides the drainage of the Bampur river from that running to the Persian302 KAL-KAL kalaghan— % A well watered valley in Persian Baluchistan, lying on the northern ; slopes of the Kuh-i-Siahan, about 30 miles east of Dlzak. Geographically it is of importance, as the main kafileh routes from the Mashkil valley on the south, lead through it to Jalk. The road from Dlzak and Kalpur- kan crosses by the Brinjlnan Pass (4,600'), which is practicable for wheeled artillery ; and that from Isfandak by the Bunsir Pass (4,500'), which is practicable only for pack transport. The Kalaghan river, rising in the Kuh-i-Siahan flows northwards, and eventually loses itself in the Mashkld Hdmun. Along the banks of the river are numerous villages and some dilapidated forts, but none of any great importance, the principal ones being, starting from the south, AibI, Pahura, BalaKalat,LljI, Nagan, andKaleh-ud-DIn, all of these being des cribed separately under their own names. | The valley is famous for its comparative fertility, and especially for the luxuriant growth of its maiden-hair fern. Among many writers who have described this spot, Sir Thomas Holdich, who visited it in 1896, says :— “ Water was running with refreshing abundance in the Kalaghan valley. There was no haunting suspicion that it might run dry in a week or so, for it spread out into swamps with tall reeds and grass, with snipe in the midst of it. At intervals appeared forts, protecting small clusters of white mud-built houses, surrounded by palms, and rich with fields of wheat and beans, encompassing orchards of pomegranates, figs, and mulberries. Kalaghan is as picturesque in details as some of the Himalayan valleys ; the pity of it is, that there is so little of it.” It appears that at one time Kalaghan rivalled Talk in prosperity, but that the district was ruined by a great flood in 1862, from which it has never been able to recover, while yearly increasing taxation has prevented it from making any real material progress. The inhabitants of Kalaghan are a wretched-looking people, but little better than the Bampur slaves, and are said to be almost all Arbabis, a subject tribe not far removed from serfdom. The chiefs are physically both finer and fairer, and probably belong to a different race.— {Jennings, 1685 ; Sykes, 1896 ; Holdich, 1901 ; Grant, 1902.)

Its dimensions are from 2 to 3 miles broad from north to south, by 3 to 4 miles long from east to west. It is now for the most part dry, with white efflorescent shur covering the exposed surface, except at the north-west corner, where there is a large pool containing 2 or 3 feet of water. The entire ground is covered with long grasses, reeds and rushes, and is fringed with tamarisk trees. It receives all the drainage of the Galugan and Gvarkuh plains, also that from the slopes of the surrounding ranges. At the west corner it is from 6 to 8 feet deep and is full of wild fowl during the rains. At the south-west corner, where the Rizabad and Siah Band ranges approach, is a deep gorge through which the surplus water drains away and flows into the Bazman hdmun, which is situated under the Rizabad Band range some 8 miles west of ChasLmeh-i-Shuraf and, as far as I can see, disappear s into the plain there. From what I subsequently saw from the top of Kuh-i-Zindeh, I cannot see how any of this drainage joins the Narmashir {vide map).

But at this period (April 1885), owing to fear of a raid by the Sinjaranis, many people have come here from eastern Sarhad to graze their flocks and herds. Cultivation from Jcdrizes generally, and a little from the river.

Grass, grazing, wood and water are abundant and good. The village is included in the Bampur district. History. —When Saiyid Khan (father to Sardar Karim Khan) wa_s the chief at Vasht, this village was included in Sarhad, and the Katkhudd here was named Mir Manji (Kurd). The latter took one-third of the total produce from this place, as also from all patches in the Siah Band as far as Jairi Nala. When Mir Manji quarrelled with Saiyid Khan, the latter confiscated the former’s right to the said one-third share of the produce. Mir Manji complained to the Persian Government. The latter decided the matter by annexing Karvanda to Bampur. Now Mir Manji possesses large flocks and herds, and cultivates a certain portion of land to the west of Karvanda. Some 124 miles to the west, i.e., beyond Ganich, near the watershed sepa rating Karvanda Nala from the Hehmukki Ndld draining to Sarhad Hdmun, is a white hill, from which much chalk is obtained; and opposite to this,’ to the south, in the slopes of the Siah Band, are the remains of numerous ovens and bits of furnace clay identified as cla} from a copper furnace”—showing that copper was once manufactured here. The roads leading from here are the ones traversed.— (a) to Vasht: (b) to Bampur, via Damin ; (c) to Bampur, via Karag Kutal; (d) to Vasht, via Jauri and to Sehkuha, via Jauri, both avail able for guns.— {Jennings.) KlRVANDA (River) (Kirman)— Flowing past the village of the same name southwards, it eventually meets the Bampur river.— {Jennings.) KARVAN KAUR— A stream in the Karvan district, on the coast of Persian Baluchistan. It rises in the hills, beyond those called Jaodar, and running south appa rently falls into the sea east of Kunarak Kuh and Ras Maidani. It is possible, however, that it may join the Rapch, and the cours s of all streams in the plain vary constantly. Floyer’s route from Kashi {q.v.) to Bint led up the Karvan through the hills. At Pugunzi halting-place, 26 miles from Kashi, the bed of the stream was 300 yards across. The water ran in numerous small channels and was fairly sweet, although the boulders were white with crusted saline deposit. From this place down through the Jaodar hills the [ -bed of the Karvan is full of fish (dwarf palm), resembling miniature date- groves, and greatly increasing the beauty of the river from the high banks. Above Pugunzi the route leaves the Karvan and crosses a shingly plateau to the Tank river.— {Flayer.) kArvAnsarai— An old serai in the Shamil district (g-.u.).

A village in Rudbar (q.v) in Kirman.318 KAS-KAS It consists of 400 to 500 inhabitants, and is situated on the western border of the Lut desert with a stretch of date-groves stretching north and south for 2 miles by | mile in width. The fort and village are situated on the lower slopes of a range of hills west of the date-groves. A large stream of slightly brackish water flows through the village and past the fort. The water is said to be impregnated with zdk; this and the excessive heat of the place are said to cause the early death of the inhabitants, now living beyond 40 or 50 years of age. About 60 of the inhabitants are adult males ; they were Levies until about 1907 when they were discharged, their breech-loading rifles (Werndl) being taken away from them. They now all possess old muzzle-loaders. In the event of attack by robbers the whole population take refuge in the fort. The fort is a large one built on a rocky eminence and commanding the whole village and the date groves, it in its turn being commanded by the neighbouring hills. The walls are badly cracked, but on the whole the fort is fairly intact. The interior is a labyrinth of tunnels and passages ; many of the rooms are occupied by villagers. A deep well inside the fort has not been uncovered within living memory. Half the cultivated ground is owned by the inhabitants, the other halt bv a nerson in Kirman. Taxes calculated at 10 per date palm yie d ±m tumdns annually, half is paid in at Khabis by the villagers, the re mainder by the property owner in Kirman. The production of dates (Keruteh variety only) is about 700 kharwars (200 tons) annually ; some aie sent to Bam and the remainder taken by Bistanis, who visit the place in the autumn, bringing wheat to barter for the dates. Sufficient wheat is grown for the use of the inhabitants for three months, the supply for the remaining nine months of the year being obtained from Sistanis as above-mentioned and from N arm ashler A small quantity of henna is grown, about 3 kharwars Q ton per — About lo oxen, 30 donkeys and 100 to 200 sheep and loats are owned by the villagers.

It is situated amongtills on the upper course of the Kaju stream {q. v.), which contains an abundant supply of water. There appears to be a palm-grove, as dates are procurable in addition to fuel and forage, but there was only one hut in February .1871. The ordinary route to the Champ plateau leads up an affluent ravine to the villages of Surian and Champ. It is impracticable for artillery, but another road ascending the main stream of the Kaju is said to be passable for wheels.

Elevation about 6,600 feet. A small dilapidated village of about 30 mud houses with a few orchards and a little cultivated ground and also a mill. In its vicinity, scattered over the plain, are several other small tumble-down hamlets with orchards and cultivation. The Dasht Ab plain is but sparsely cultivated and inhabited; many of the houses are deserted. The soil is good and well supplied with water, and there is fair grazing all over it, yet there is a general appearanee of neglect visible all round, and the inhabitants appear poverty-stricken. There is a small stream of hill water passing down close to the village, and qandts are seen over the plain. There are five weavers, one carpenter, one mechanic, two dyers, and one felt worker. Supplies scanty ; water plentiful and good ; no grass or forage. We got 16 eggs for 1 hr an and 4 mans of flour for 6£ Jcrans. — (Brazier-Creagh, 1894.) KASH KUSH—&gt;See Daman.

KASKIN— A valley adjoining the Kafanu valley, about 13 miles south of Am on the Kirman-Bandar Abbas road, in the Kirman district. The road south from the Kafanu pass runs along a well-beaten alluvial track down the Kaskin valley, with the Kaskin river to the west under the Kaskin hills ; to the east is the lofty snow-clad Lalehzar kuh. This valley is some 4 miles long and miles broad, and contains several fine old orchards ; there are also some cemeteries with tombstones bearing dates of 200 or 300 years ago. It is now but sparsely inhabited ; there are no per manent buildings ; only a few hashams are seen along the valley. The inhabitants go to the Garm Sir in cold weather and are only now return ing.* There is at present * no cultivation, but the valley is green and covered with flowering plants ; a profuse crop of yellow tulips, cowslips, blue-bells, and narcissus are seen, and all the orchards are just blossoming.* Sixteen miles south of Aru is a cemetery close on the left, and a little way on a path runs off over a well-beaten track to Babur via Bizinjan. The road from this runs parallel to the river, which is close on the right ; it is a deep rapid hill stream, some 30 yards wide, with fine old willow-trees scattered along its banks. Water (brackish) from pools in the river-bed, which are generally much fouled by camels. Camel-grazing, grass and fuel in large quantities l mile from the camping-ground. Horses thrive well in this valley, and it would make an ideal hill station for cavalry, were it not for the question of supplies.

KAUR GURAN— One of the two navigable channels between Baft Point and Guran, island of Qishm, Persian Gulf. It is the more eastern of the two, is narrow (in some parts under a quarter of a mile in width), but generally preferred by the pilots, as the water is 5 to 15 fathoms deep. The banks are of mud, and well defined by the mangroves on them. _ Its course is tortuous, being south from Laft Point for 9 miles, passing about 1 mile westward of that town; thence north-west for 2| mi es , and then turning sharp south-west and south-south-west for 9 miles more, to the village of Guran. It then trends west-south-west for 2 miles, when it re-unites with the western or main channel. This last reach is the most difficult part of the passage; it is very narrow, with 12 to 15 fathoms water, and the banks are covered at high water, and have no mangroves on them.— [Constable] Stiff e ] Persian Gulf Pilot, Lorimer.)

The leaves are stripped from it and dried, after which they are ground up and are ready for use. Cold quickly destroys the plant, but it usually yields for six or seven years in succession. The henna of this part is much esteemed. The heat in summer is so great at Khabis that nearly all its inhabitants forsake the place for higher Climate. ground, leaving only a few to look after the cultivation. The wind known as the Bad-i-Samiim, rising in the desert, blows for about forty days in summer during part of each’ day, generally an hour before and an hour after noon. It is said that those who are caught by it in the desert are frequently destroyed, but it is not fatal where trees abound, and it is affirmed that the dates do not properly ripen without it. During four months of the heat, this wind prevails from the direction of Khorasan. The place is well supplied,with water from two streams, which after uniting are conducted to the gardens and groves of Khabis by canals. To the north-east of Khabis, at a distance of about 12 miles, is situated a tract of salt formed by the deposits of some collection of water from the mountain torrents, which apparently sweep over an intensely saline soil in their passage. The extent of this deposit is described as being from 9 to 12 miles ; the salt is several inches in depth, and is carried in slabs for sale to neighbouring places. Eastward of Tikab lies the great desert, extending towards Sistan—an arid waste and wilderness, which neither man nor beast can inhabit. The town was held, off and on, by the Afghans, until the Kajar dynasty was firmly established. The remains of their elaborately fortified walled city, which was contained within a square trace, and covered about 100 acres, are still evident, lying to the east of the present town . The supposed ruins of an ancient Christian church are situated a mile to the east of the town and are known as Akus —said to be a corruption of Nakus, the wooden gong used by Christians in Muhammadan countries. The ruins consist of the remains of a shrine, containing a brick grave dated A.H. 173 (A.D. 789) ; and a more ancient pre-Muhammadan building, together with what has been identified by the Reverend A.

Narmashir is less arid than other parts of the province, but even there the water-supply is said to be yearly decreasing, and the desert to be gradually encroaching. This is probably due to a constantly diminishing rainfall, consequent on the gradual dis appearance of the forests, which are slowly being exhausted by the char coal burner. Few ranges are now covered at all extensively with timber sparse bushes being generally all that can be found. Rain very seldom falls before the middle of November or after the Rainfall. March.

In summer the breeze is cool on the plateau, but down below there are hot winds which, across the But, are intensely and dangerously hot. The only other climatic condition which would interfere with the marching of troops is the melting of the snow in the spring which causes floods in the rivers, which are however very seldom unfordable at the places where the mam caravan route crosses them. In 1902 experiments in artesian well boring were made, but were not successful. An ancient dam used to exist some miles up the Halil Riid and could again be reconstructed at a trifling cost; it would dam up an extensive catchment area and quadruple the water-supply of the Jlruft. The Garmsir is the name given to the belt of country which lies be- Garmslr. tween the great mountain ranges and the sea. n/rr -i , This extends along the coast of Persia from Minab to the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab or Basrah riyer, and varies in336 KIR—KIR breadth from 30 to 100 miles, its greatest width being in the direction of Rudbar and Jiruft,Across the plains of which it stretches np to the mountain barrier of Sarduieh. Within the limits of Kirman this tract is composed mostly of saline sand. Here the palm flourishes, while wheat and barley are grown as winter crops, reaped in early spring. The inhabitants are almost as dark as those of the Punjab. Part of the great Lut desert, which has an average^ elevation of 2,000 feet, and which is supposed to have been originally an inland sea, lies within the limits of Kirman province. The route across the Lut is bad f but caravans annually cross it to Bandar Abbas from Herat. While being impassable for an army or even a brigade, it is feasible as a caravan trade route. There is more water than was supposed to exist, and it is this trade route in Bandar Abbas to Sistan and Herat via Rigan and Mlnab that is the natural one, not via Nushki and Quetta.

In addition there are several levies of horse and foot doing police work along the main roads. The soldiers are practically untrained and are armed with very obsolete weapons ; they seldom receive pay, and are of little practical account. But in the nomad tribes there is a fine reserve of raw material, which might be converted into excellent cavalry. As in all other districts in Persia, the Government of the province is farmed out to the Governor-General, who Revenue. makes himself responsible for the revenue. In 1900 the revenue was 315,000 tumdns (£63,000), while the amount collected was probably £90,000, of which £10,000 was the Shah’s fishfcash, the balance going into the pocket of the Governor-General. The imports for the year 1893-94 were estimated at £97,900, and the exports at £89,000. The Russian imports for Trade - the same year were £3,000. The principal trade centres, besides the capital, are Saidabad, Bahramabad, Khabis and Bam. Since the British Commercial Mission to South-East Persia in 1904-05 the Russian efforts in organizing their trade in Russian -trading enterprise. Kirm - n an q ^s adjacent districts have been more vigorous than they had hitherto been. In June, 1905, a Russian trader from Isfahan visited Kirman, and having entered into an agreement with the Kirman merchants (Parsis and local Persian merchants) obtained certain orders for the purchate of Russian manufactured goods. _ This visit of the Russian trader from Isfahan was followed by the Commercial Ml ssion of Prince Amatuni, who arrived in Kirman from Yazd m January, 1906. While in Kirman and at Bam the Prince was engaged m investigations regarding the trade of the country. From Bam Prince Amatuni went to Bandar Abbas, thence visiting-Bushire. The Russian Consul, here also established Russian trade agencies in Kixman, Bam, and Rafsmjan.342 KIR-KIR Owing to recent troubles in Russia the goods mentioned in the above- mentioned agreement were not received at Bandar Abbas in November, 1905, as was stipulated, but arrived later. It is reported that Russian manu factured chintzes and other woollen cloths to the value of about 24,000 tumans (about Rs. 60,000) were brought to Bandar Abbas by Russian steamers and sent to Kirman to the Barsis and local Persian merchants of Kir man and Yazd. A Russian steamer service company is also reported to have been established in the Persian Gulf, with their agents in Bandar Abbas, styled the Russian trade and steamer agent* in the Persian Gulf. It is said that the chintzes brought by the Russian steamers and delivered at Bandar Abbas were not of the same quality as the samples mentioned in the agreement, and the merchants here complained of the matter to the Russian Consul, but the result is not known. Some 400 cases of Russian loaf sugar from Bandar Abbas and some 400 tins of kerosene oil from Meshed, with a quantity of Russian tea, were also imported into Kirman during the year under report. The Russian tea is not liked by the Persians, in consequence of which the trader who imported it is said to regret his enterprise. The carpet trade of Kirman, which is entirely in the hands of the Tabrizi ^ Turk merchants, who export to Constantinople arpet tra e o .rman. and America, has been more prosperous during the year under report than it had been in the previous one. It happened twice during this year that there being a great demand for carpets in Constantinople and America the value of the Kirman and Afshar carpets rose, and the carpet merchants of Kirman profited handsomely by the occasion. The well-known carpet merchant, Agha Muhammad Haji, Tehrani of Kirman who took his caravan of carpets a second time to India via the Nushki-Slstan trade route, and who is still in India, appears to have failed in his enterprise. There appear* to be no very great opening for a Persian carpet trade in India. The British trade of Kirman is chiefly in the hands of Hindu agents of _ . . , , , the Shikarpur firms. A few Parsi firms here also The British trade of Kirman. . . , r - f _ import broad and Ctishmir cloths, .etc., from Bombay but do no export business. A young Parsi from Bombay came and opened a shop of fancy goods in one of the caravanserais in the town during the year under report. In a few months’ time he disposed of all his stock and returned to India. No statistics are obtainalle from the Kirman customs office, and it is impossible consequently to give an account of the imports into, and exports from, Kirman. The value of Russian goods imported into Kirman during 1906 was about Rs. 1 25,000.KIR—KIR 343 Kn, ® maDt. it 2i,Cd Kassiai The following figures, however, obtained from the Hindu merchants of Kirman, may be taken as approximate :— Exports from Kirmdn into British India during the years 1905-06 and 1906-07. ctaDtsol Mry f« 1905-06, Approxi- 1906-07, Approxi- Bamlai Quantity. mate value.

The province of Kirman has, from its earliest appearance on the stage of litis history, been of considerable importance, while xpoits its extent at the present day is approximately what it was more than 2,000 years ago. When the Indo-European trade went across Persia instead of round the Cape the town of Kirman was the )0 second most important town in Persia and in early days Camadi in Jiruft was a most important place.344 KIR-KIR Its first mention is found in the pages of Herodotus, who refers to it as forming one of the twelve tribes of Persia. Strabo gives a general account of its dimensions, fertility, and mineral wealth, in terms which would be fairly applicable even now. In the great epic poem the ‘‘Shah in ameh, the king of Kirman is mentioned as fighting on the side of Kai Khusru against the forces of Turan. Alexander the Great traversed the province irom east to west on his return journey from India, while Krateros entered it from No reference to Kirman is found during the period of the Parthian dynasty, but after enduring a foreign yoke for five centuries., Ardashir, son of Papak, defeated Artabanus in a desperate battle near Ram Hurmuz (A.D. 218), and established a national dynasty which lasted till the ’Arab conquest and under which it enjoyed a state of general peace and ^ When ^the Nestorian sect spread over Persia, Kirman became a .See under the Metropolitan of Pars (vide Khabis). During the Arab invasion, after the battle of Nahavand (A.D. 642), Kirman offered little opposition, and, though rebellions and risings were of frequent occurrence, the Muham madan rulers became the more firmly established, till gradually the majority of the population themselves embraced the tenets of Islam. For the next 400 years Kirman was the scene of battle and murder, where one king succeeded another, only to be ousted in his turn by a stronger than he. . In A D 1013 Mahmud of Ghazni seized Kirman, but eight years after his death, which occurred in A.H. 421 (A.D. 1030), a mighty wave of conquest rolled westwards across Asia, when the Seljuks captured Merv and Nishapur, and Malik Kaward, son of Chakar Beg, hewed out a kingdom for himself in Kirman, which was held by his descendants for a century and a half, and included, till the reign of Arslan Shah, the province of’Oman, which Kaward annexed by an oversea e pedition. Kirman under the Seljuics was at the zenith of its prosperity about the year A.D. 1100, after which a fearful condition of . rapine and anarchy succeeded, when the Ghaz, expelled from Sarakhs, invaded the provmce, marched to Baghin, defeated the forces sent against them and raided •Bruit, killing, harrying and destroying. Kirman was practically deserted and e province laid waste. Malik Dinar of the Ghaz tribe, about A.H. o81 (A.L&gt;. 1185), established himself on the throne, upon which followed as usua , intrigues and counter-intrigues of rival and succeeding claimants, till the great Mongol irruption under Changiz Khan indirectly changed the course of its history, when a certain Borak Hajib managed to assume supreme con trol under the overlordship of Changiz Khan. One of his successors, the widow of Kutb-ud-Din, was on the throne when Marco Polo passed through on his outward journey. She appears to have ruled wisely and well, to have founded villages, which are still flourishing, and many qanat pipes stamped with her name are even yet extant in the province. She died about A.H. 681 (A.D. 1282). . . , , A n 19Qn It is interesting to note that Arghun Khan, reigning about A.D. 12JU, ! sent embassies to the Pope and the kings of France and England while Edward I accredited Geoffrey de Langely to the Court of the Mongol, with a return embassy and presents.KIR—KIR 345 Kirmln! ^ ^ ^ n ° ted bj MarC ° Pol °’ that H ° rmuz was under About A.H. 741 (A.D. 1340) the Muzafhr dynasty was founded bnf tWoo 0 !

Since then governor has followed governor for longer or shorter periods °f office, the present ruler being (in A.D. 1905) His Highness the Kuhn- ud-Dauleh, who is a first cousin of the Shah.

The communications of the Kirman province, as a whole, are in a very Communications. backward state. No trouble is taken to repair r , i , , .

The original town and fort are reputed to have been founded by Ardashir about A.D. 220; though with regard to this there is considerable uncertainty. At the time when Indian trade with Europe went across Russia instead of round the Cape, the city was the second in importance in Persia. Kirman is mainly surrounded by desert, absolutely devoid even of bushes, but, lying as it does at the junction of many roads, it is naturally important as a trade centre. For its water it is entirely dependent on qandts (Sykes, 1902), though every house has, besides, its well, the water- level being some 50 feet below the surface, and the water being fair to brackish. There is a fine supply of water, but as a rule owing to the open channels through which it runs it is most impure and wells are not safe to use as a rule as sewage percolates into them. There are certain mineral properties in the water that are liable to cause stomach complaints. With the exception of some limestone crags in the immediate neighbour hood of the city, Kirman is some 8 miles from any range, while south-west, south and south-east, a wide belt of sandhills extends ; but further off, 20 miles to the south-east, the Jupar mountains attain an elevation of close on 13,000 feet, while to the north lies the KuhPaieh range (about 10,000'). The sandy nature of its soil, its considerable altitude (5,680') and the scarcity of water, accounts for the great healthiness of the city. Approaching Kirman from the east, the city presents a somewhat con fused medley of wind-towers and mosques, surrounded by ruins on every side, giving it the squalid appearance common to so many oriental towns. Half a mile to the east of the city rises a limestone crag, some 500 feet above the plain, upon which are built the two forts of Kirman. 2 ft 2KIR—KIR *7 ' % 318 The first—Kaleh Ardashir, (dating back probably to A.D. 220)—has its walls of colossal sun-dried brick, resting on stone foundations, still in almost perfect order ; below, on a westerly spur, is a second keep, between which the road winds up to the castle on the crest, which possesses a triple line of defence. According to legend its ancient well was con nected with Khabis, but so many.murders were Committed by throwing the victims down it, that it was filled up about 1860. The second fort, Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, or virgin’s fort, is situated on another crag of smaller dimensions, half a mile north-west of Kaleh Ardasfcir, and between these two the principal buildings, including the pajace and mos que, were situated, but now all is in ruins ; there are, however, still found there many valuable lustred tiles, bronzes, seals and coins of the Caliphate, etc., etc., which the villagers occasionally dig up and bring in for sale. On the southern spur of the main crag is a detached cliff, with 143 steps hewn out of the rock leading up it; immediately below is the deserted quarter of Farmitan, said to have been destroyed by the Afghans about A.D. 1750. High up among the crags to the east is a small shrine and spring, the Tak-i-’Ali, which is believed to be connected with the Zindeh Rud, and is said to have run red at the time of the massacres at Isfahan in the eighteenth century. In the plain the ruins lie thick, tombs and mosques jostling each other for places. The only stone building in Kirman is one of octagonal shape, surmounted by a bracketed dome, the apex being of brick ; it is known as the Jabalia, and is believed by the Persians to be the “ Dome of Gabr,” or “Dome of the Fire Worshipper,” the origin of which had been lost in antiquity, even before the conversion of Kirman into a capital. Moving westwards towards the modern city, the Bagh-i-Zirisf which covers an area of half a square mile, and in which the British Consulate is now situated, is approached; beyond it, and following the ancien, city walls, the modern Zoroastrian quarter is reached. Touching it to the north is their old suburb destroyed by the Afghans in 1750, the chief ruin of which is known as the Khaneh Farang; outside, again, is the race-course, half a mile in Lngth. On the south-west side are the remains of the lines of in vestment of Agha Muhammad Khan, when he besieged Kirman about 1793. The city is surrounded by a clay wall in a good state of repair, about 30 feet high, with a ditch 40 feet wide and 10 feet deep, forming an irregular hexagon/ measuring roughly a mile from east to west, and slightly more from north to south. It is divided into five quarters— (1) Shahr, including part of ancient Kirman, (2) Khwaja Khizr, (3) Kutbabad, (4) Maidan-i-Kaleh, (5) Shah Adil, and three extra-mural quarters— (a) Gabrl, (6) Mahuni, (c) Jumuiidl. Touching it on the west side is the Ark or fort, in which the Governor- General resides, and containing the post and telegraph offices, barracks and arsenal; all in good repair.There are six gates and roads leading from the city (1) Baghin Gate.

The Central Persian Telegraph line, which was constructed by the Indo- European Telegraph Department, vid Kashan, Nain, Yazd, Kirman, Bam, and Persian Baluchistan, reached Kirman from the west in October 1903, and Bam in January 1904.

It is a small place of reed huts.— {Smith.) Kt}H— A village in Larak island {q.v.). KtHAK— Elev. 2,920'. A strong fort and small district in Persian Baluchistan. It lies in the lower part of the Mashkid valley, on the borders of British Baluchistan, and is bounded on the north by the watershed of the Kuh-i-Siahan as far as a point about 10 miles slightly west of north of Kuhak itself, from thence it runs in a south-easterly direction to the Mashkil river, 7 miles west of its junction with the Rakhshan stream. Then, following the bed of the Mashkil, it runs in a westerly direction to a hill on the north bank of the river, about 1J miles below the junction of the Gazbastan stream with the Mashkil, almost immediately south of Kuhak fort. Its western border consists of an undefined line running north and south somewhere between Isfandak and Dehak, but where it joins the southern boundary, is not at all clear. Its extent then is roughly some 35 to 40 miles long, and about 18 miles broad, and consists of avast glacis of gravel sloping gently upwards from the Mashkil to the foot of the rugged Siahan, which rises here to a height of 6,500 feet. The bed of the Mashkil is large, and its towering banks point to its havinv been once a mighty river, but now even in spate, the torrent is readily forded after the first rush. In March 1896, there was only a foot of water at the ford, below Kuhak. The district contains various date-groves and hamlets, but Isfandak and Kunar Basteh are the only ones that require mention. Geographically Kuhak occupies an important position, as through it passes all the trade up and down the Mashkil valley, which forms the main route between Bampur and Panjgur in_ British, territory. There is a Customs Frontier Post at Kuhak under Sistau. Historically Kuhak is of great interest. It is said that originally it belonged to Dlzak, but was conquered early in the nineteenth century by a Naushirvani chief of Kharan, who married the daughter of the rightful owner, after putting the latter to death. There is no doubt that it ^formed part of the dominions of Nasir Khan I of Kalat after the death of h adir Shah. However, Persia unceasingly put forward claims to Kuhak m common with the rest of western Baluchistan, and supported them byforce on every possible occasion. Many times did they besiege the fort, but never successfully. In 1871-72 a Boundary Commission, under General Sir Frederick Gold- smid, was despatched by the Imperial Government to demarcate the border between British and Persian territory. This was satisfactorily done frem Kuhak southwards to the sea ; but northwards, as far as SIstan, the country was unexplored and of unknown ownership, and so was left alone ; while the difficulties encountered by the British representative, in dealing with his Persian colleague, were found to be so insuperable, that the commission had to break up. The Shah would not accept the arbitrator’s decision, and the final agreement with the Tehran Court left Kuhak and Mash 111 together with a long stretch of frontier up to the Helmand, mostly undefined and unmapped. As soon as the British Commission was out of the country, the Persians seized the district of Kuhak, though whether they actually captured the fortress is uncertain. No action, however, was taken by the British Government till 1896, when, the raids across the border becoming intoler able, another Boundary Commission, under Colonel Sir Thomas Holdieh, was appointed, and boundary-pillars set up from Kuhak to Kuh-i-Malik Siah, by which Kuhak was definitely handed over to the Persians .—{For further particulars regarding this Commission vide Mirjdud.) In 1902, when a British and a Persian force were co-operating against the outlaws and turbulent factions of this part of Baluchistan, its chief, Mir Ghulam Muhammad, at first refused to come in and make his submission to the Governor-General of Persian Baluchistan; but owing to the good offices of Major Showers, the Political Agent of Kalat, a rupture was avoided, and the Governor-General finally presented Ghulam Muhammad with a khilat, and a letter (in which he was described as a Persian subject) saying that he might retain his fort, subject to future good behaviour. In March 1902, the following description of the Kuhak fort was supplied by Lieutenant Hart, R.A., who visited and sketched it:— The fort is built on an apparently solid plinth some 20 feet high, with the main wall rising another 20 feet above this, protected at the south-west corner by a terrace, and by a stone locpholed wall for half its height. Two main towers rise from the centre, one about 60, the other 70, feet from the ground. The walls appear to be about 2 feet thick, loopholed every 6 feet. The entrance to the fort seems to be by a passage on the north side, leading up through the solid plinth. The fort is surrounded by an outer wall 10 feet high and 2 feet thick flanked by four towers at the corners. The entrance through the outer wall is by a big gate house on the western side close to its north-western corner. This wall is not loop- holed. The approaches are through cultivated fields on all sides, except the western, where it leads over a hill, while date palms to within 100 yards afford fair cover. Hills surround and command the fort on all sides, offering many good gun positions, from which the fort could be shelled at a range of 500 yards.— {St. John, 1872 p Holdich, 1901; Sykes, 1902; Showers, 1902 ; Hart, 1902.)' ; / KUH-KUH 366 KCH-I-BAHARAN or BARAN— A range of hills, east of Shusp.

KUlK or QUlK^ (Haqi ’Abdul Nabi, A hamlet in the Bariskhan district of Kirman, 12f miles from the tele graph office of Jashk, and about 4 miles from the old town of Jashk on the road to Anguran.358 KUI-KUL It consists only of a few miserable reed huts. There is no cultivation, and no supplies are procurable, but fair camel-grazing is to be had. To the west of the village is a large ndld, about 200 yards wide, with banks 30 feet or 40 feet high, whch runs in a south-westerly direction down to the sea. Though dry when Medley visited it in June, it is said to contain a good deal of water in the rains. The water-supply is from shallow wells dug under the right bank of this ndld, and although scanty, is of good quality. This ndld is probably what Lorimer calls the Kvaik stream.—{Medley and Massy, June 1893.) KtfKAM— A village in the Shamil district {q.v.). KULlNl-- A halting-place in the Sarbaz district of Persian Baluchistan, on the east ern of the two roads from Bampur to Sarbaz. These roads divide at Kahir {q.v.), which would be the fourth stage from Bampur. Pagodar {q.v.) on this road is about 7 miles east of Kahiri; but travellers if they stopped at the latter would probably pass it. The road from thence follows the fish- choked ravine for about a mile and a half, to the foot of the watershed range. After crossing, the road immediately enters the Kulani ravine, which is the main branch of the Sarbaz river {q.v.). The pass over the range appears to be easy. As there is tamarisk and water in the ravine, a halt could be made here, say at 11 or 12 miles from Kahiri. Thence the track descends the bed of the watercourse {see Sarbaz River), and appears to be tolerably good for camels. There are pools of water under the rocks at intervals. Kulani is reached 17 miles from Pa Gudar halting-place, that is probably about 14 miles from the crest of the pass and 13 from the halting-place on this side of it. The regular camping-ground on the right of the stream was found by Sir F. Goldsmid’s party, who travelled by this road in Feb ruary 1871, to be so infested with camel ticks and bugs, that they were obliged to shift to the other side, Wood and water are abundant at this etage. From Kulani the road continues to descend the ravine {see Sarbaz River), and at 13 miles is joined by the Ispatki road {q.v.) which comes from the north-west by north down the ravine from that place. Sarbaz itself is reached 6 miles further on. This route is about 10 miles longer than that via Ispatki, but is better, insomuch that there are narrow places on the latter where baggage animals have to be unloaded. Nevertheless, it appears to be the most used by Jcdfilehs and people of the country, while the Kulani route is adopted by the Persians for the movement of their troops and artillery. The passage of guns, how ever, along this road can be no light or easy matter.— {Euan-Smith.) KULI t&gt;AP— Elev. 2,450'.

The courage and raiding talents of the Kurds wj 6 a PP reciate d by the Baluchis, and the elevated plateau of Sar had, ditticult of access on almost every side, afforded them a secure base from which the chiefs, assisted by the local tribes, could lead forays in every direction. There is no doubt they plundered in Persia quite as much as in Baluch territory. It appears that while fully aware of, and ac knowledging, their origin, the Kurds of Sarhad now call themselves Baluch— a name which, despite St. John and some others, is held in high repute throughout Southern Afghanistan, Eastern Persia, and the country which we are pleased to call Baluchistan. In 1838 Haji ’Abdul Nabi found Madat Khan, Kurd, the dreaded chief of Sarhad ; but it would appear that, like the Naushirvani Chief of Kharan, and others in this region, he had no great number of his own tribesmen with him, his retainers being said to consist of Persians (among whom Kurds are perhaps included), Bamarl, and Damani Baluchis.kur-kur S84 The power of the Kurd chiefs of Sarhad continues almost undimmished to the present day, although within the last few years they have submitted to the Persian Governor of Bampur. {See also Sarhad.) _ In 1881 General Gasteiger Khan, a German officer m the Persian service was sent on a special mission to the Baluch frontier. In his published narrative of the journey from Tehran to Jalk he gives the following highly coloured account of his meeting with Said Khan, the present chi t Sarhad at Vasht (q.v.) in that country:— , . , I had special ioJLL for the chieftain Said Khan “ I ^ few days in advance to inform him of my coming, and to tell him I had orders irom Majesty the Shah, and also that I had selected Chash (Yasht) as a halting-place “ Xh° U oSlta J WM at this time along with his tribe in tbo fe UawbichfOTmthchne of demarcation between Sistan and Baluchistan. I shall first relate the past career ot thta Prince and then introduce him to the reader. About two hundred years ago the ancestors of Said Khan emigrated to this place from Kurdistan, ^ bo by Shah ’Abbas the Great, from whom they received large grants of land, free flC The t Kurds^Lcurtomed from boyhood to an unsettled life, and h avi ng a preddec^ tion for fighting and plunder, found here, where they were surrounded by a wild mountainpeopfe, a congenial life and a favourable field for their profession of robbery and murder. So powerful were they, that the present chieftain has gained a ureaYreputation by his success in raiding all the surrounding people for the last twenty years. He accomplished the most daring feats, and at the head of his tribe fewSsTom th“of TehrSn he emptied the well-fffied granaries he- lomdng to the wealthy farmers in the plain of Varamin. Returning heavily laden with ilunder, he made many more daring expeditions m the neighbourhood of Ispahan, Yazd, and Kirman. His success gave him great influence, and he soon madean alliance with the robber hordes of Afghanistan, and also sometimes lent troops to a less powerful chieftain, named Azad Khan, who was the ruler of Khar an, andhad a force of about 10,000 men.* I heard later that these chieftains ^tvVen no robber expeditions were going on. Said Khan used to return to the moun tains where he occupied his time in pleasure, agriculture, and rearing cattle. The ,e M tried to win over this daring chieftain ; bnt it either did not choose the right means, or the chief was too crafty or cunning to tTU* i the plausible speeches of the emissaries of the Shah who tried to entrap him. Since the battle of Chash (Le. Yasht), where he was only conquered by the two guns whr h the Government troops brought to bear against him, ho has aided the Government fe subdue some of the rebel tribes, and the Shah has showered honours on i th At lash worn out by the constant changes, hemmed in by the English in Afghanistan and the Russians in Turkistan,t and dispirited by the condition of ^ people, who me very much reduced in circumstances owing to the general orought which had prevailed for several years, Said Khan was compelled to try and inaugurate ami b e relations with the Government ; and to effect this was the object of my mission to him- * Said Khan can hardly have been in alliance with any Afghan. A few from the Helmand vallev may occasional y have joined his plundering expeditions. Azad Khan whose Lee is not above half of what is here stated, appears to bave been cer orally at war with the Sarhadis ; in some of his raids he has been assisted by the Earaichis of Shurawak.—(See Khar an in Gazetteer of Baluchistan.) t u is hardly necessarv to remark that the English and Russ an movements can have had no effect whatever on Said Khan. Gasteiger writes as if this leader of bandits was sovereign of an independent State.I was the first to arrive at the place appointed for our meeting, and I pitched my tent nt the foot of his robber’s nest, and waited for the roaring lion. He came accompanied by his two sons, and disarmed himself in front of my tent, retaining only a dagger in his belt. He was over fifty years of ago and of splendid physique, with decision of character shown in his features, a pleasant voice, free and abrupt manners. He stood before me in his Afghan dress, without constraint, but with dignity. It was a critical moment when this man, whose doings had often made the whole of Persia tremble, and whose life was principally occupied by murder, arson, robbery, and slave-dealing, stood before me. After a short but friendly greeting, I addressed him in the following words : “In the name of mine and your imperial master, whose head radiant with diamonds you have never had the honour to behold, I deliver to you his gracious wishes. His Majesty knows and honours your bravery, and it is his supreme will to strengthen our alliance ; and believe me I belong to a country where the first virtue of man is to keep his word. ’ ’ He answered : “ I disarmed myself before your tent, and I now hand you my dagger; but I have three hundred well-armed men waiting behind the mountain, ready to obey my signal. I know that your escort is composed of sixty men only, and also that you earry no valuables with you, but I believe if I were to take you prisoner, the Shah or your relatives in your own country would ransom you for a heavy sum. But the ruins, which have overlooked many a hard-fought battle, still belong to me and are my home in which you are a guest; and no Kurd ever violated the laws of hospitality.” We were soon deep in conversation, and I made a report to His Majesty of our arrangements, the principal of which were as follows : Said Khan places 1,000 well- armed men at the disposal of the Government. He asks for 100 pickaxes and shovel for purposes of cultivation, 10 pairs of draught oxen, and 150 sacks of grain for seeds besides the old privilege granted by Shah ’Abbas of holding his lands free of revenue, These demands were so moderate and reasonable that I thought the Government would agree to them. We also considered the absolute necessity of entrenching a posi tion for a war depot at this place, which is so situated that direct communication with the rear by Rigan could be established without going near Bampur, and also with Jalk in the front. It could also be made a point of concentration against the frontier oi STstan and against the tribes of Baluchistan. As I am writing Said Khan has offered to help with 500 men against the Bashakard tribes, who are just now in rebellion, having refused to pay the taxes. This expedition will be commanded by General Ibrah m Khan, and accompanied by His Highness the prince-governor. Said Khan presented me with a shield as a memento, and made the following speech: “ This shield has saved my life several times, and I hope it may render the same service to you. ’ ’ KURGAR ob Khargar—Lat. 29° 16' 20'; Long. 61° 0' 15'; Elev. 5,189'.

There are large quantities of pomegranates. Adour grazing for camels and donkeys is plentiful. There are two very large qandts, the northern coming from a kdriz, the southern from a ndld. The water of both is very good. Kurhk was said to be the largest and most famous village of Narmashir. There is a very old fort, stated to date back to the Afghan period. There are two detachments of sarbdzes, each consisting of 88 men. They possess 176 Werndl rifles. These, however, are not of much use as the men have only self-reloaded cartridges, with bad powder..

Water from wells is good and abundant; firewood and camel forage also plentiful.— {MacGregor.) LADGUJU ob LADGAJU— A village in Makran on the Maluran river {q.v). LADl— Elev. 1,500'. A village in the Bampur district, 10 miles west of Kalanzah, on the road to Bijnabad, and about 67 miles west-north-west of Bampur. It is situated in quite a forest of tamarisk and thorn trees, some of fair size and appearance. Flocks are numerous, and there is good grazing for camels. The inhabitants are poor Baluch shepherds. Euan-Smith says there are two wells here, both brackish, but one some what better than the other. In 1881 General Gasteiger Khan was sent to report on this place as a post station on a new military road through Persian Baluchistan. It (with the others on this road) was to be colonized and surrounded with high walls for the protection of the inhabitants ; but this project does not seem to have been carried out.— {Goldsmid ; Euan-Smith ; Gasteiger Khan ; Brazier-Creagh, 1^94.)

It is situ ated on the banks of the Ladis river, which flows in an easterly direction towards MIrjawa {q.v-), and consists of a ruined village and fort, deserted years ago, with a little wheat cultivation. The soil is good ; there is an unlimited supply of water from the river ; camel-grazing is abundant; but fuel is scarce, and other supplies are nil. The fort is reputed to have been built about A.D. 1400 by Timur Shah Tartar, but is now abandoned owing to the undermining action of water on the cliffs on which it stands.LAD—LAF 371 The district contains 7 hashams or tent encampments.

LAFT (Village)—Lat. 26° 53' 49' ; Long. 55 ° 46' 9'. A considerable village situated on the western side of the great salient from the north coast of Qishm island, of which the extremity is Laft point; Laft village, situated in a recess of the coast, is about 3| miles south- south-east of the point. It is built at the foot of a hill which slopes up from the beach to a height of 200 feet and ends in cliffs on the land ward side. The approach to Laft is by a small narrow creek opening from the Guran branch of Clarence S rait ; its mouth is marked by a low islet called Hindrani and its course to the village, a distance of over 2 miles, is between the coast of Qishm island and a mangrove-covered mud-flat which divides the creek from Kaur Guran. In this creek native vessels lie. The village is close to the shore and consists of about 250 houses of Arabs and Persians, not belonging to well-known tribes, who are chiefly engaged in fishing and boat-building and in cutting firewood for^ 'r-r 872 f LAF—LAK Bale from the adjacent swamps. The water-supply, which is from toofo* tanks is slightly brackish ; there are also some wells sunk 25 to 30 feet in the’ sandstone rock which are used when the tanks run dry. in small quantities are available; livestock comprise about ^ttle “d 200 sheep and goats. There are three ordinary mosques but the place has no local shrine. The hill behind Laft is scarped and the scarps are strengthened at their crests with curtains and flanking works which, with a dilapidated fort having 5 circular towers pierced for guns, a PP e ^ r to traces of a former European occupation. The Imperial Persian Custom have a post here.—(ionwer, 1906.) LIFT qadIm— A place in Qishm Island ( 3 . 0 .).] LAGtA— A lake in the Kusha valley, Sarhad. It is situated in the bosom of lofty serrated ranges of variegated hills, rising some 800 to 1,000 feet above it. It bears evidence of being an extinct volcano with lovely, pellucid water filling up the crater. It is circular in shape, being about 300 yards long by 250 wide ; the sides are precipitous, shelving straight down, and it must be very deep. The southern and eastern banks are fringed in parts with long dense reeds, and the centre of the lake is black with large flocks of duck, teal and water hens, which lie tantalisingly beyond gun range.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894.) : LAHAN— r A village near Bazman (q.v.) in Persian Balilchistan. LAHANG— A village in the Kain district of Khorasan, about 20 miles north of Duruh in the Kuh-i-Shiba on the extreme eastern inhabited frontier. It has an old fort, with some houses built outside ; the inhabitants number about 30 families. It is a place of some little importance, and it has a number of hamlets depending on it. Including the hamlets, it has about 800 inhabi tants altogether, but it is a wretched ruined place. Some of the inhabitants live at Haftad Rud, 9 miles off, for a portion of the year and cultivate.— (Stewart ; Abbas Ali, 1907.) LAJX or LlJl— A village of Kalaghan in Persian Baluchistan.

LARAK or LARACH *— Lat. 26' 53' 30 *; Long. 54° 25' 10*. An island in the Persian Gulf, 20 miles south by east of Bandar Abbas, and partially closing the marine approach to that place from the south j between Qishm and Hormuz. The channel between Larak and Qishm to the north-west of it is 6 miles, and that between Larak and Hormuz to the north-north-east 11 miles broad. Larak is oval-shaped and measures 6 miles from east-north-east to west-south-west by about 4 miles across ; the chief irregularity of outline is a small sandy cape which juts out from the north coast. The island is closely surrounded by deep water, except on the west side, from which a shore-reef extends for about £ mile. The interior consists of a mass of rugged hills of sandstone with an admixture of rock-salt and red oxide of iron which are almost entirely destitute of vegetation ; the highest summit, a mile from the north shore, is 510 feet high and another a mile to the south-west of it is hardly inferior in elevation. There is no vegetation ; sweet water, with the exception of that of the Salmi well, is not found unless in reservoirs. There are many wild gazelle, which are exceedingly shy. The inhabi tants, about 200 in number, are Dhahuriyin, but are closely connected to the Shihuh tribe of Kumzar and they speak the Kumzari language. There is no trade except in salt, of which some quantity is exported to the adjoining district of Ruus-al-Jibal in the Sultanate of ’Oman and to Qishm town, which is the market in which the inhabitants of Larak make most of their purchases. The people assert that they are independent of * A plan of the greater part of Larak is given as an inset in Admiralty chart No. 2837*1Wt ,i| 374 LAR-LAR any ruler except of their own Kumzari Shaikh at Labtiab village, and up to 1905 A.D. no visible signs of Persian authority existed, but the island was said to be nominally included, along with the islands of Qishm and Hormuz, among the places at present farmed by the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar of Tehran. Larak seems to have been at one time occupied by a non-Muhammadan people, for a flat-topped hill on the east coast is covered with hundreds of graves, all of which run east and west. A large valley between Labtiab village and this curious hill and all the flat ground upon the circumference of the island appear to have been highly cultivated at some former time ; the evidence consists in remains of water-channels and embankments.

Date trees number about 50 and a patch or two of barley are culti vated. There are the ruins of an old fort and the ground near by, called Kharabistan, bears traces of former occupation by a civilised people. This village is also called Larak and is the chief one on the island. It has a date-grove and near by is an old fort in toler able repair, said to be Portuguese. There is sweet water from one well and two reservoirs. The people are fishermen and the only industry is a little fish curing ; livestock amount to 5 donkeys and 200 sheep and goats.

The north-eastern end of the Lashar hills is said to form the scarp plateau of Champ, but further south there is no reason to suppose that the country on the Geh side of the hills is more elevated than that on the Bampur side. In fact it is highly probable that its general characteristics resemble that of the tracts to west through which- the Aimini river flows.LAT—LUN ,,, v (f/ r . 1 n r„ 376 LATARK- . . ^ A village near Bazman {q.v.) in Persian Bamcnistan.

Madeh is the name of a small walled mud fort or village (situated 21 miles south-east of Hauz-EGudar-i-Zard and 34 miles south-east of Neh on the road to Kuh-i-Malik Siah) about 25 paces square with four towers at the corners The walls and the towers are still standing and m good condi tion, but the gateway and the roofs of the houses or single rooms inside, about 12 in number built along the walls on three sides, have fallen m. Two brick kilns built for burning bricks for houses and earthenware pipes for karizes (under-ground irrigation channels) are situated at a shor distance from the village. There are bits of large bricks and earthernware pipes scattered about, but no building of burnt bricks exists m the place. The water-supply depends on a kdriz from which flows a small quantity of brackish water. Some of the wells have fallen in and blocked up the channel, but all are full of water. The water of the higher wells is of better taste than that of the lower wells. If the kdrlz is cleared out and repaired, it would yield perfectly drinkable water, sufficient for irrigation of land, the produce of which would support the population of a good-sized village. The village is said to have been built by the late Amir of Kain (Mir ’Alam Khan) about 30 years ago, but was neglected after a few years, and the few families that were located in it, left about 12 years ago, owing to scarcity of grain caused by failure of crops for three successive years. The soil contains a small quantity of salt and is apparently not very productive, but it is perfectly fit for cultivation. The village now lies deserted, but if the present chief of Kain could be induce! to repopulate it, it would make a good halting-place for caravans going from Persia and Afghanistan to Quetta by Kuh-i-Malik Siah. There is a tamarisk jungle near the village and firewood and camel graz ing are plentiful. Bhusa obtainable ; and perhaps 300 to 500 lbs, barley at harvest time.— (Maula Bakhsh’, Reunion, 1909.)

A village and small sub- district of Bampur m Persian Baluchistan, in the district of Dizak. The village consists of some 130 houses, collected round a high mud fort on the east side of an extensive date grove, and is situated in the middle of the plain, some 3 miles from the southern end of the Kuh-i-Birg, and about 87 miles east of Bampur. The fort, surrounded by extensive palm groves, is of the usual Baluch Magas fort. ioft T and hav ing a citadel. It was de stroyed by Showers in 1901, but has since been rebuilt.

Snow sometimes falls, but does not lie long on the ground. The Magas fruit is of superior quality. The revenue of the district is Us. 3,000. There is a considerable amount , of arable land, which is well watered and MMiat and resources. i r u p manured. Large heaps of manure were seen in several places. Throughout the date grove, and around the village, neat walled-in gardens are visible, with crenellated coping on top. These gardens contain the following fruit trees, vegetables and flowers Fruit-trees. —Apple (sib), peach (hal), mulberry (tut), pomegranate (andr), grape (angur), pear (amrud), apricots (zarddlu). Flowers. —Rose (gud), blue tulip (Icarchuk), snowdrops, white violets (bartag). Vegetables and spices. —Onions, beans, brinjdls, turnips, radishes, chillies, anise and coriander. Supplies are obtainable in fair quantities. Barley was scarce in winter. The rate is 12 seers for the rupee; that oiyouari bupp es. |5 S eers for the rupee. Karbi and lucerne are obtainable. The latter, when dry and well-saved, is first-class forage, but is scanty here. Sheep cost Rs. 4 or Rs. 5. Fowls, milk and eggs are also obtain able. There are large flocks of sheep, goats and cattle, also a number of camels and donkeys. The sheep are fine, heavy-framed, fleshy and large-tailed. There are a number of black-fleeced sheep in the herds ; the fleeces are thick and the wool longer than usual. Altogether, these sheep are much fatter than in other districts, and their flesh better-tasting. The higher altitude of these plateaux accounts no doubt for the superiority. Water is obtained from karizes and is abundant; good fuel is scanty and is brought from the neighbourhood on donkeys. Several caravans bring grain from Sistan and return with dates. The Magas dates are noted for their superior quality. Exports an imports. Wool, cotton, goat’s hair, ghi and dates are ex* ported to the coast. y 2380 MAG-MAG There were the following mechanics in Magas in Trades. 1893 10 iron-workers. 5 mistris. 3 leather workers. The Magas plain is about 18 miles broad here, from west to east. From its centre a lofty limestone ridge, called the Kuh-i- Magas plain.

The plain is bounded on the west by dense masses of hills which separate it from the Bampur district, viz., the Hamant, Ispidan, Munzuri and Shushan ranges. On the east the Band-i-Kashan separates it from Sib. It is open to the north on both sides of the Kuh-i-Birg. It is also open to the south towards Irafshan and Bampusht, on either side of the Kuh-i-Multan, which is a lofty hill 6,165 feet high, some 12 miles south. Villages in the Magas District. Villages.

There were 100,000 sheep and goats, 4,000 donkeys, 3,000 cattle and 50 horses, in 1894. . A large amount of supplies are obtainable here, and there is a busy bazar. 100 mans of fresh lucerne at 3| krdns, 37 eggs for 1 krdn, 3 mans of onions for £ krdn, 1| mans of barley for 1 krdn, and bread for 1 krdn a man, were obtained in April 1894. Over 300 Indian maunds of opium are said to be cultivated here annually. The gardens of Mahun are the principal source of supply for the Kirman fruit and vegetable markets. Mahun is celebrated for its ancient shrine, erected in honour of Shan Ni’amat Ullah, who was a descendant of Imam Bakr, and was born at Aleppo in A.H. 730 (A.D. 1330). The shriue. He was a great traveller, and is reported to have spent 80 days in medi tation on the summit of Damavend in mid-winter, and a similar period on Mount Alvand, the Orontes of the Greek geographers. He thence pro ceeded to Karbala, where he lived on dust for 40 days, from which shrine he visited Najaf, and resided for seven years at Mecca. However, he was a bom rover, and travelling for many years, visited India, Samarkand and Shiraz, where everyone showed him great respect. It is said that one of the kings of the Deccan sent him such valuable presents, thattlie customs dues amounted to £70,000 ; this sum Shah Rukh remitted, as his wife pointed out that, if exacted, it would not look well in history. Recent travellers have had no difficulty in gaining admittance to the shrine, though the Goldsmid Mission was prevented from visiting the mausoleum. The shrine is situated in the centre of the village. In front are fine gardens and fountains ; behind, opening on a street, is a large courtyard. The inner room, which contains the tomb, is beautifully carpeted, and on the tomb is some fine old tapestry. Two ancient brass candelabra, said to have been given to the saint at Delhi, bore the inscription c ‘ Kutab Din, son of Nasar Din.” Outside this room is another one with a finely worked screen enclosing the tomb of Shah Kalilulla, son of Shaikh Ni’matullah, who died in A.H. 866, i.e., A.D. 1461. In the large outer room are two other tombs : of Bak- tash Khan, son of Vail Khan, and his wife, Kausa Kathun, who died respectively in A.H. 310 and 311, or 923 and 924 A.D. In another small small dark room is the tomb of Shaikh Abdul Fath with the date A.H. 48, i.e., A.D. 668.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.) Villages in the vicinity of Mahun. Villages.

British Makran, as we may call the portion which is attached to Baluchistan, is excluded from consideration altogether, and in Persian Makran mmute consideration will be directed only to the narrow maritime plain which borders the sea.

The larger streams are the Jagin, Gabng, Sadaich, Bapch, Kair and Dashtiari, which contain water, in deep hollows, more or less throughout the year; the remainder are mere torrent- beds which after rain are impassable for a day or two, from March to August contain water in pools, and thereafter become dry on the surface but still yield water, at about 10 feet below ground. Water is most scarce in the part between Chahbar and the Chil river. The maritime plain, of which mention has already been made and with which we are more particularly concerned, is bounded on the inland side by a range of hills of which the average height appears to vary from 1,000 to 2,500 feet: this outer range, which has no general name, is not straight or continuous, but nowhere does its distance from the sea much exceed 20 miles and towards both extremities, as well as in the centre between the Rapch and Kair rivers, it approaches with an elevation pf over 1,500 feet to within a few miles of the coast. It is composed ordinarily of a light- coloured clay with streaks of gypsum, and is capped with sandstone, which frequently contains fossil remains. The greater part of the maritime plain is a sandy waste diversified by- long dunes of sand in certain localities, but here and there occur patches * Remarks on particular physical features, as the principal and river.s, will be found in the separate article on the JSshk district and in tlie topographical table at the end of the present article. t See Aitchison’s Treaties, X. 177. 61 I.

Mud volcanoes are met with between the Bir and Kair rivers, and on the sea beach, 15 miles east of New Jashk, there are some hot springs. Trees are not found on this plain except by the banks of rivers, where tamarisks and acacia grow in profusion and even large banyans are some- times found;but grass and other small vegetation is fairly plentiful after rain. In the hills of the interior the Pish palm flourishes, and the banyan and even the mango occur in some inland valleys. Wild animals include, in the neighbourhood of the coast, the leopard, wolf, iackal, fox, hyama, gazelle, ibex, and oonal, while black bears are found in the more northern areas. The bustard, partridge (?), chilor, sisi, pigeon, dove, vulture, kite, falcon and raven are always found and the wild duck, sandgrouse and quail at the seasons of their migra tion southward. The kupper, or adder, scorpion, lizard, centipede and tarantula are all seen, also the viper, which is very common, and the black rocksnake, which is seldom met with.

At New Jashk the thermometer has been known to fall in the cold weather to 47°. Kainfall is uncertain, but usually occurs in November, December, January and February, occasionally continuing into March ; the annual rainfall has not been observed but is probably on the .average between 6 and 7 inches; it diflers considerably from place to place. j v In summer it would be impossible for Europeans to sleep under canvas by day on account of the heat ; while wherever water exists, mosquitoes and other insect pests frequently make rest impossible.

Almost every adult carries a sword, pistol or revolver : only the lowest classes, that is the fishermen and herdsmen, go unarmed.

Except the Mullas, the entire population is illiterate. Popular ballads m which the deeds of tribes, chiefs of districts and other heroes are extolled, together with songs having similar themes ana chanted by rovmg mmstrels of the Lori tribe to the accompaniment of a kind of fiddle, supply the place of literature and the arts. Cultivation, in the maritime plains, is mostly confined to the beds Agriculture and livestock. an ^ banks of rivers, where an alluvial soil exists accompanied by the means of irriga- tmn, and to places under the hills where rain water is caught and uti lised by means of embankments ; there are no canals or regular wells only water-holes, and the crops depend almost entirely on rainfall, which is deficient on the average in three years out of every four. Near the coast the staple of cultivation is the date, but small quantities of wheat, barley, millet and jowari are grown, also some cotton: in the valleys of the interior the percentage of arable soil is larger, and consider able quantities of dates, wheat, barley, jowari, millet, lentils, rice and cot ton are grown. The winter crop of cereals is sown in November and reaped in April. Manure is not used, and the crops frequently suffer from the depredations of locusts and caterpillars. A wooden plough, re sembling that of India, but much smaller in size, is the principal imple ment of agriculture ; field labour is mostly performed by domestic slaves, and seed-grain is usually obtained from British Indian traders. The portion of the population directly interested in agriculture is small and probably does not exceed 20 per cent, of the whole. One-fifth of the gross produce is the share ordinarily taken by the chiefs of districts or headmen as the revenue of cultivated land. Livestock and domestic animals are camels, donkeys, horses, buffaloes, cattle, sheep, goats and dogs, all belonging to indigenous breeds, and of small size ; horses and buffaloes are both scarce. The Jats are the main pastoral tribe ; they live a primitive life, subsisting almost entirely on dates and milk and changing their grazing grounds frequently according to rainfall. The chiefs of districts collect a small tax in money from the owners of herds grazing within their territories. The sea fisheries are an important asset of the part of Persian Makran Fisheries. we have to do. The fish are of numerous kinds, and may be roughly divided into two classes, those which are taken for local consumption and those which are caught for export. Most of the first class are procurable throughout the year. Of the second class, about 90 per cent, of the total catch are cured and eventually exported.390 MAK—MAK Fishing is carried on with both net and line, and the. bulk of it is carried on by local boats, of which two or three are owned in almost every coast village between Jashk and Gwatar. In April and May however and again from October to December, Chahbar is the resort of a score of large sized boats owned by Arabs, and of a dozen others from Gwadar which come to take part in the fishing. The fish caught for export, whether by natives or strangers, are cured on the spot by being gutted, rubbed with salt, kept a few days and then washed in the sea and finally dried in the sun. The fish, when thoroughly cured, are sold to Baluch and Indian retail traders,, who visit all the places upon the coast periodically in order to purchase them for resale to merchants at Chahbar and Gwadar ; the profits of the fish trade are said to be large, amounting to as much as 40 per cent upon outlay. There are no pearl fisheries upon the Persian Makran coast. The only considerable ports are Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar, and a leading part is played in the foreign commerce Foreign trade. of ^ Strict by Hindus and Khojahs, British subjects, who reside permanently at Chahbar and Gwatar. The chief exports are dates, 'pish palm mats, dried fish, poto or fish- maw isinglass, shark-fins, raw cotton, gM, goat’-hair, camel-hair, wuol and hides in small quantities. The annual value of the exports appears to be about Rs. 1,50,000 at Chahbar and Rs. 50,000 at Gwatar : the trade : of Gwatar is at present depressed by the prevalence of disorder in the neighbouring country. No estimate is possible for Jashk or other smaller ports. The bulk of the exports goes to India, but a portion to Arabian ports. The profits of the export trade are said to run from 15 to 20 per cent, or, in the case of dried fish, from 25 to 40 per cent. Imported goods are principally rice,flour, piece-goods,lead,iron,tobacco, beads, mineral and vegetable oil, matches, tea, cotton thread, silk, spices and sugar, and the profits of the trade are placed at 20 per cent., on the average. The annual value of the Chahbar imports is estimated at Rs. 1,00,000 and that of the Gwatar imports at Rs. 30,000; for Jashk and other ports there are no data. It should also be mentioned that there is a considerable importation, chiefly from Masqat, of modern rifles manufactured in England, France, Germany and Belgium. The internal trade of the country is carried on chiefly by barter, agri- , , , cultural and pastoral products being exhang- Internal trade and manu- ^ for drie(i fop aiK l foreign imported goods. The ports of Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar are the main trade centres; Tank and Galag also are markets, but petty ones. Business is chiefly in the hands of Baluchi and British Indian traders. The merchandise is transported about the country on camels and donkeys. Manufactures there are none, except of pish palm mats, partly for export, and of swords and pistols for local sale. The silver currency consists of Maria Theresa dollars, by Baluchis called Qursh and by Arabs Riyal, worth at present Rs. 1-4-0, each ; of Persian Jcrdns here worth one-third of a rupee apiece, and of the Indian rupee in Persian Makran styled Jcaladdr : the small Currency, measures. weights and■ change of the country is copper pice partly of Indian and partly of Masqat mintage. A gold coin, called Sor, is said to exist and to be worth Rs. 7-8-0 but it is now hardly, if ever, seen. The principal weights are the Qiyas, ordinarily equal to about 8 oz. avoirdupois English but varying from place to place, and the Man, which is subject to wide fluctuations between 7 and 15 English pounds. The common measure of length are the Baluchi Gaz or cubit, equal to the distance from a man’s elbow to the tip of his middle finger, or about feet, and the Persian gaz of about 3 feet. Distances are estimated on the coast by time and inland by a farsakh of about 4 miles, which is defined as the space that a walking horse will cover in an hour on ordinary ground. The land-line of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Gwadar Communications, supplies to J » shk Everses the whole district, keeping and transport. near the coast : the only offices in Persian Makran are at Chahbar and Jashk. There is a continuous route along the coast which passes through Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar, eventually reaching Gwadar ; and the ports of Jashk, Chahbar and Gwadar, as well as some of the smaller places on the coast, are connected with the district capitals of the interior and through them with Bampur, the nearest seat of a high Persian official, by various routes, of which the major portions lie beyond the scope of our inquiry. These routes have been fully worked out, along with a number of cross-routes in the interior, by the military authorities in India.* Here it is sufficient to remark that the roads of the country are all camel-tracks, and that,— though on some there are difficult places,—as lines of communication they are fairly good of their kind. The maritime plain between New Jashk and Gwadar is free from physical obstacles in dry weather and could then, it is reported, be made passable for field artillery in a few days : but the route along it is everywhere liable to be interrupted after rain for one or two days by floods in the torrent beds which cross it from the hills, or for 5, 6, 10 or even 15 days by the larger rivers ; and in the Dashtiari and Bahu districts the country generally is sometimes impassable for a fortnight together. In a dry season the use of the coast route would be strictly limited by scarcity of water, fodder, and other supplies, and it would probably be impossible to move with more than 500 men: it is estimated that in a favourable season, that is, after good rainfall, the local supplies of sheep, goats, ghi and fodder might suffice to maintain a force of 1,500 men, except in the Dashtiari and Bahu districts, where the water is bitter and a detachment of even 100 men would be supplied with difliculty. In the hills, supplies are at all times less inadequate : some particulars are given in the notes on districts toward the end of this article. Water, slightly brackish, can generally be obtained even in the hot weather from holes in river and torrent beds at a depth of from 4 to 15 feet. There are also some artificial tanks called otags which are filled by rainfall and are frequently not exhausted in less than 6 to 8 months. These are not common on the coast but there are 8 between Chahbar and Gwatar. * See in particular Routes in Persia, Vol. IV, Nos. 41, 43, 45, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100A, 133 and 136392 MAK-MAK # Pack-carriage is obtainable to a limited extent throughout the country, and abundance of camel transport can be obtained at Chahbar and Jashk on short notice. Maritime transport consists of a number of boats owned at places upon the coast. Gwatar has 4 Safri Bojis of 75 tons • and Chahbar boasts 12 vessels of 20 to 100 tons burden manned by crews of 8 to 20 men which run to Karachi and Bombay as well as to Arabian ports. New Jashk possesses 4 and Tank 6 boats of about 12 tons with crews of 5 to 7 men trading to the coast of Arabia only; and at Galag there are 5 boats pf 20 tons each. The total shipping of the coast is thus only about 40 boats of 18 tons and over : there are few boats at smaller places which are not included in the above estimate. Persian Makran, except the district of Jashk is administered by a Persian Administration. Governor or Hakim, who has his seat at Bampur and is subject to the authority of the Persian Governor-General of Kirman. Persian Makran is divided into the five districts of Jashk, Geh, Qasrqand, Dashtiari and Bahu; of these, the first is described under its own name and the remainder receive short notices below. Each of the districts except Jashk is ruled by a chief who pays annual tribute to the Persian Governor at Bampur, but in regard to the internal adminis tration of his district is exempt from the interference of the Persian ex ecutive. In fact, with the exception of Customs employes on the coast, and a Baluchi Vali representing the Governor of Bampur at Chahbar no Persian officials are to be found in Persian Makran, and similarly there are no Persian garrisons ; when however the annual tribute is refused or falls into arrears, the Persian Government is accustomed to make an incursion into the country with regular troops and wheeled artillery, and to de vastate the refractory districts by way of punishment. Persian Customs officials are stationed only at Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar, and foreign trade at other places on the coast is forbidden, but the prohibition has not yet been successfully enforced. The Chiefs are assisted in the administration of juctice by the religious authorities or Mullas of the country and delegate their executive authority to headmen of sub-districts, who in some cases are hereditary but are more commonly appointed by the chiefs: these headmen have almost plenary powers within the limits of their jurisdiction, and are responsible for the collection of the taxes. The ordinary taxes are ith of actual gross produce on cultivated land, a grazing due of £ to 2 krdns per animal for the year on livestock except sheep and goats, 1 to 2 per cent, in kind of sheep and goats kept, and 10 per cent, in kind of fish brought to market. There are no recognised laws, and order—so far as it exists—is enforced by primitive, summary methods ; formal protection of life and property is almost altogether wanting, and its place is only partially supplied by the blood-feud system, which renders aggression upon natives of the country dangerous to the committer. Arms are frequently used in tribal disputes, but serious disturbances are rare.

The Geh district is reported to contain large patches of cultivation, and the water is said to be generally good : it is estimated that supplies and forage to maintain a torce of 1,500 men would be forthcoming all the year round. The passage ot wheeled artillery in this district, if possible, would be difficult The chief village of the Qasrqand district is similarly named Qasrqand : its population is^ about 1,500 souls and it is situated on the Kaiii affluent of the Chil river 68 miles north by east of Chahbar and 1,775 feet above sea-level. The population of the district is about 12,000 souls, and the tribes are the same as in the Geh district. The first levy of this district comprises about 300 men, and the second 1,500. The Qasr qand Chief, like the Chief of Geh, is a GichkI : the present Chief is Jan Muhammad _ It is calculated that the resources of the Qasrqand district might support a force of 1,000 men. The country is unsuited for field artillery. The Dashtiari district has a population of about 18,000 souls, the tribes will be found in the tribal table above. The principal village is Miri Bazar, with 1,500 inhabitants, situated 35 miles north-north west of Gwatar. The well-armed fighting men of Dashtiari are said to number 1,000, and the less well armed 2,500. In the coastal part of the district it would be difficult at any time to maintain a force of 100 men, and after heavy rain the country is generally flooded and may remain impassable for animals during a fortnight. The present joint chiefs of Dashtiari, the brothers ’ Abdi and Mahmud, are Jadgals, and are related to the Chief of Bahu. They each receive a telegraph subsidy of Rs. 500 a year from the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Bahu district has a population of about 14,000 souls : its capital is Bahu Kalat, with 1,000 inhabitants, situated 38 miles north of Gwatar. The tribal table already given shows the tribes to which the people of the districts belong. About 500 of the fighting men are said to be ermed with modern rifles, and 2,500 with indifferent weapons. Near the cogst there are the same obstacles to the maintenance and movement of troops as in Dashtiari. The Chief of Bahu, Mir Ashraf, is a J&amp;dgal; he belongs to ihe same family as the Chiefs of Dashtiari. He receives Rs. 600 per annum as a telegraph subsidy, and one of Rs. 400 is also paid to his cousin Mix Ahmad. 61 I.

It consists of a small date grove, the ruins of a fort (captured in 1887 by Azad Khan of Kharan, after a desperate resistance) and four or five wells, containing salt water. Fuel, grass and grazing are abundant. There are now no inhabitants, but the Damanis of Sarhad visit the place twice a year, to fertilise the palms and pick the fruit.— {Showers, 1902 ; Grant, 1902.)

On the telegraph route map the Malikl Chidag is marked as Malikani Chedag, about 6 miles from Sadaich, at the foot of the Huni hills {q.v.). Ross says it is in the low hills north of Sadaich. Its exact location is a point of some little interest, as native tradition asserts it to have been erected by an independent prince, or malik, of Makran, to mark the limit of his territory. It is also said that Nasir Khan I of Kalat extended his sway as far as this point. HajI ’Abdul Nabi mentions another boundary mark of the same name near Qasrqand. MALIK SIAH, KUH-I— Elev. 3,125'. A halting-place on the borders of Sarhad and Sistan, between the stages of Duzdab and Hurmuk on the Ladis-Nasratabad road, distant 28| miles from the former and 5 miles from the latter. It has a small spring of sweet water. There is a Customs Frontier Post at Kuh-i-Malik Siah under Sistan. It is the residence of a British Indian vice-consul (under the 2N2404 MAL—MAN / consul of Sfstan) There are a few houses. A small amount of supplies pro curable ; no cultivation. The temperature here on January 3rd, 1899, was 27° F. at 8 a.m., and 45° F. at 6 p.m. Close to the halting-place is a low black hill, which marks the spot v.here the boundaries of the Indian and Persian Empires meet these of Afghan istan. It was selected by Sir Frederick Goldsmid, who noted that it was the first hill met with to the south-west in a suitable position for terminating the Sistan boundary, which was accordingly delimitated in a direct line from the Sistan dam to this point, but no boundary pillars were erected. It was not until 1896 that the Perso-Baluch and Baluch-Afghan frontier were demarcated, and shortly after this the latitude and longtitude of this •—the north-west boundary pillar of the Indian Empire—were finally fixed by Mr. G. P. Tate of the Indian Survey.— (Wood, 1899 ; Sykes, 1902. Molesworth 1907.) MALURAN—Elev. 1,300'. A small village in the Bashar district in Makran, 30 miles west of Geh and 6 miles west of Kushk, situated on the east bank of a river of the same name which joins the Bint river. The village consists of some 30 huts scattered over an open elevated ridge overlooking the broad bed of the Maluran river. North of the village is a small date grove and some cultivated ground watered by kanzes. Supplies scanty. Water good and abundant from the river.

ANISH— Elev. 3,579'.MAN-MAN 405 MANtFJ AN—Lat. 27° 24' 15.' Long. 57° 28' 0'. Elev. 1000' A village and fort in the Eudbar district of Kirman, 122J miles from Bandar Abbas, on the road to Rigan The fort, owing to its position on the borders of Bashakard, must havehtocd numerous sieges. Its caiture and the torture of its garrison by malik Dinar at the end of the tw elfth century A.D. are mentioned by Muhammad Ibrahim in his history. Some two centuries later it was besieged by Afghan and German mercenaries. Jennings, who visited it in 1885, thus describes it :— “ The Manujan fort is situated on the end of a spur, or promontory, running from south to north, nearly from the main range. The spur is composed of variegated shale with nearly perpendicular st rata, and is seme 30 to 50 feet above the plain. The foundations throughout are of boulders, set in excellent mortar, the entire superstructure being of goed burnt bricks set in mud. “One turret stands about 60 feet above the foundations, i e., 90 to 100 feet above the jilain; another is 40 feet in height (above its foundation) and is 50 feet in diameter at the top. The w 7 alls are several feet in thickness. Regarded from a military point of view 7 , the site of the fort is badl^y selected, as it can be easily con manded from neighbouring hills To the west the remains of a city wall exist, the circumference of the whole being from f to.l mile. Within this space are the remains of several wells and kdhns. This was evidently once a place of considerable importance, as outside the walls are still to be seen the remains of numerous houses but all are now (May 1885) in ruins; and even the fort, which is in fairly good repair, is uninhabited, the people preferring to live in ghiddns or temporary hovels in the neighbourhood.” Decay has, however, evidently proceeded rapidly, for Napier, who visited Manujan in 1899, states that the fort was much dilapidated since Jennings’ time, while Grey, in 1905, found it in a very ruinous condition. There appears to be no proper village of Manujan. According to Grey there is, close to the fort, a group of 10 or 12 huts, with a zidrat, 3 good wells and a date grove, called Bullulabad, but this is probably only one of the numerous groups of houses which both Jennings and Napier say dot the country all round in the vicinity of the fort. The population is esti mated at 1,800, including 1,000 youths, and there are 2,000 jezails for their use. Ten thousand sheep and goats, 2,000 cattle, 40 camels, and 3,000 maws of seed are sown yearly. The date groves consist of about 6,000 palms. The land in the district is said to be the richest in southern Persia and is w 7 ell irri gated by kdrizes and cuts from the Manujan river. Large quantities of wool and grain are exported toBandar Abbas, the rate of hire being 2 tumdns per camel-load of wool. Labourers receive 1 krdn per diem. There is considerable caravan traffic through Manujan in the cold w T eather, and it is estimated that nine caravans, each composed of not less than 500 camels, pass through from Kandahar or Herat every winter. The inhabitants of the Manujan plain call themselves Baluchis, and the district, as wnll as the adjoining one of Bashakard, is under the Governor of Rudbar. The KatkJmdd (1902) is Meshedi Husain. Some supplies are procurable, and camel-grazing and fuel are very plentiful406 MAN—MAQ « Gibbon who visited the place in 1908 says that the whole plain is kown as Manujan, and through it runs a river from which excellent water is obtainable. He mentions a very ancient fort known as theKaleh-i-Manu- jan, in the immediate neighbourhood of which are several wells about 20 feet deep. The ground is rich, but the number of inhabitants is not very great. The population and cultivation however seem to have increased in a marked degree during the previous 7 Or 8 years. The place is an excel- lent one for breeding cattle. The inhabitants live in huts made of palm leaves in number about 200 scattered all over the plain. They own 30 buffaloes, 200 cattle and 5,000 goats and sheep. In Gibbon’s opinion this would be a good centre for troops in case of military preparations. There are good roads in all directions which are for the greater part suitable for wheels even in their present condition. (Jennings 1885 ; Napier 1899; Grey 1905 ; Slier Jang 1902 ; Gibbon 1908.) MANUJAN (Kiver) or RUDKHANEH-I-SAGHIN or RUDKHANEH-I- RUDKAN or RUDKHANEH-I-MlNAB— A river which rises in Kirman province, north-east of Manujan, and flowing past Jaghin, BirintI and Minab, empties itself into the straits of Hormuz at a point 'about 40 miles east-south-east of Bandar Abbas. The Bandar Abbas-Rigan road follows its course from Minab to Manujan, and crosses it frequently. It is the classical Anamis, where Nearchos, landing at Harmozia, marched inland to meet Alexander the Great, in the valley of Halil Rud. At Jaghin the stream in October is only about 25 yards wide, but a couple of miles lower down it sometimes spreads out in the winter season to a breadth of 1 mile, when caravans have to halt for three or four days until the water subsides. Two and a half miles above Birinti its width in the month of October is about 45 yards with a depth of 6 to 18 inches. About 3 miles below that village it is joined by the Duzdi stream from the north, and at Bagh, a short distance above Minab, their combined waters widen out to 150 yards (in October) with a depth of from 6 inches to 2 feet.— (Napier, 1899.)

It is said to join the Dahart river lower down .-—{Medley and Massy, July 1S93.) MARRI— A place in the Maskhutan district of Persian Baluchistan. It is 11 miles from Maskhutan on the Bampur road and 15 from Baluchan Chah. Floyer (1876) describes it as a miserably desolate-looking place. “About two hundred date trees, mostly dead or dying, leaned in all directions over a barren tract covered thickly with a white efflorescence, having the taste of stale soda-water. Many low mounds were scattered about, from the centres of which trickled small black streams of very clear bitter water. The owners of these trees only visited them in the fruit season, and we could neither get information nor form conjecture as to the cause of their wretched condition. The bitter springs did not appear to have broken out recently, h resh water is obtained here by scraping a hole in the wet black sand. The water that filters through into it is drinkable for about two days, and here we filled water-skins for the desert march.” Another date grove, called Dariabad {q.v.), is visible about 4 miles to the west.” Goldsmid in 1866 passed at 16 miles from Baluchan Chah, date trees an'i a pool of water in high grass. The spot may have been eithe Marri or Dariabad. The heavy sand commences at about 4 miles beyond Marri at two iow sandstone hills, called Dubum and Kahnuk. MARSHAHRl (Kieman)— A high range of mountains north-east of Manujan.—(Jenwmgs.) MARZ— A sub-division of Bashakard, with Ramishk {q.v.) as its capital. It is said to contain 22 villages and hamlets.

MAsHKID —Vide MashkIl. MASHKlL or MASHKlD— A river in Persian Balucliistan. Rising in the hills between Bampur and Magas, the Sar-i-Pahura (4,800 feet) being the watershed between.the two river systems, it flows in an easterly direction towards Kuhak, receiv ing the northern drainage of the Bampusht range, and the southern drain age of the Kuh-i-Siahan and other mountain chains to the west. Its prin cipal tributaries are the Rohtak, after its junction with the Simish, about 20 miles south-east of DIzak, and the Rakhshan, about 10 miles east of Kuhak. Numerous ndlds and streamlets join it on its course, but none of them are of much importance. After leaving Kfihak and passing into British territory, it takes a norther ly turn and flowing between the Kuh-i-Siahan and t e Kuh-i-Sabz, through the Gravag and Zorati defiles, it spreads out into the MashkIl Hdmun, where all its waters are lost by evaporation. Its total length is about *200 miles. The bed of the river is large, but water runs in it by only a few channels, and it is generally fordable—except when in spate—throughout its course as far as Kuhak, though in the vicinity of this place its high banks point to its having been once of greater size than it is at present. The chief villages along its course are, Isfandak and Kuhak, all in Persian territory ; while fair kdfileh routes follow its banks connecting the above named places, and branching off at Isfandak over the Bunsir pass (9.v. to Jalk, and at Kalpurkan to Dizak, to Jalk over the Brinjinan pass, for details of which vide the Route Book, Yol.

The village, which lies about 1 mile to the east of the road, consists of a dilapidated and deserted mud fort, half a dozen palm-leaf huts, and a date grove, while two more date groves lie 3 miles to the north-west. This and the neighbouring hamlet of Deh-i-Gau are inhabited by Baluchis, who pRy revenue to the Governor of Rudbar. They cultivate a little barley and cotton, which is irrigated from two qandts, the water of which is good. Grazing and firewood are procurable but no supplies.—(Yapfer, 1899) Newcomer, 1905 ; Grey, 1905.) maskhAra— A village in Rudbar {q.v.) in Kirman. MASKHTjTAN— Elev. about 1,500'. A village and small district of Persian Baluchistan to the south-west of Bampur, of which it is a sub-division. The size of the district is unknown,. but it is poorly inhabited and un important. It adjoins, and is almost a part of, the sandy desert country410 MAS—MAS which occupies the whole south of Bampur (q.v.). A large portion of it consists of gravelly and sandy plains thickly sprinkled with bushes and a few small trees. Bampur itself is 62 miles from Maskkutan village. The distance is done in six stages, but it is difficult marching over sandhills, and water is pre carious. Faniich is 25 miles to the south , the hills being entered at 14 miles. To the east of Maskhutan is Lashar (q.v.) ; and Pip, an important place in that district, is not more than a couple of stages distant. It lies at the junction of several tracks, those from Fanuch to Bampur and Bampur to Kamishk being the principal ones. The village contains about 500 inhabitants, and is situated on a steep low hill near the western end' of a stretch of date groves, nearly 7 miles long, fringing the southern bank of a broad watercourse. In addition to the usual Baluch huts there is a fort, now much dilapidated. Goldsn id saw in 1866 the remains of a second fort, which had been destroyed by Ibrahim Khan, the Governor of Bampur. Pie was informed that the people of the two forts, which are close together, were formerly at enmity and used to assail each other with stones. But since the Persians have been in possession of the country it is probable that a good many of these local feuds have died out. The village is very dirty. Whereas Fanuch and Bint resemble English cowyards, the' manure in Maskhutan has so much the upper hand of the grass roots and straw, that the place resembles a pig sty. As a natural consequence it is unhealthy. The people ha\e a sickly look, and smallpox and cholera occasionally make great ravages. The climate is very hot in summer, probably resembling that of Bampur (q.v.), but sometimes equally cold in winter. Floyer on the 31st December ISTd was overtaken by a violent snowstorm, 5 miles south of Maskhutan, and had great difficulty in getting his men through to Fa much. Yet the elevation cannot be more than 1,500 feet above sea-level. The people appear to be of three classes : sallow Persians, wild-looking Lash axis (Hots), and a third class of square-faced beardless men in Persian dress. But the drees here is no certain proof of the origin of the wearer. The Baluch of Makran would scorn to wear any but a Baluch dress and would particularly object to a Persian costume. Here, however, the Persian is more feared and the Baluch more ignorant, and they wear these dresses with a feeling modified, but akin to that with which the African savage attires himself in a red coat and trousers, fiffie knife worn here is called a kach (abbreviation of Jcdh clan, grass-cutter). A thick piece of wood, split down to within an inch of one end, is the handle. The blade is 18 inches long, pivoted in the centre, having one-half sharp, and the other half made into a saw, so that it can be used either for cutting grass or wood. The sheath is generally of matting. The grass roots and firewood and all burdens are carried on cows when they can be afforded, otherwise on men’s backs. Even little children carry extraordinary loads of fire wood. The watercourse, here 500 yards wide with a sandy bed, comes from the north and turns south-east at Maskhutan. In the cold season it has a small stream, 20 yards across and 1 foot deep. From this, channels ait led off to irrigate the date groves and cultivation. The soil is good,412 MAZ—MAZ ^ The villages of Man (?.«.) and Patkuk are she™ in the map among the hills at the foot of the Mazampusht Kuh on the northern side. ^‘Intke Mazampusht hills the water-parting between the oceanic and central basins turns abruptly south over the Sar-nSham plateau, after i+. rpsnmes its eastward direction. ~{bt.

A halting-place in Kirman, on the road from Rigan to Minab, 50 miles from the former place. The name means the 4 pillar ’ of Farhad, and the place is so called from an immense cone-shaped obelisk of solid’white rock, sotne 900. or 1,000 feet high, which forms a conspicuous landmark in the surrounding country. At the foot of it is a zidrat, occupied by faqirs who levy alms from passing travellers. No supplies of any sort are procurable. Fuel is scanty, and the water from the stream (which is not perennial) is salt, but sweet water can be got from a spring £ mile to the east of the rock. There is some grazing, and a curious red flower is found which has receptacles between each deaf full of a bright red dye, which is said to fetch a good price in Kirman and Karachi. The Baluch name for it is pilgusht, and Jennings considers it a sort of dragon-wort. At Mil-i-Farhad three roads take off, one goin^ east to Baluchistan, the other two being alternative routes to Bandar Abbas- one via Jirjift and Rudk -aneh-i-Duzdi, the other and main route running more to the south, through Mlnhb.—(Jennings, 1885 ; Newcom n, 1905 )* MIL-I-NADIRI— A tower or pillar m Kirman, 18 miles north-east of Fehraj, on the road from Bam. to Sistan.

V' MiNAB or MINAU (Khur or Kaur)— A salt-water creek in the Minab district providing a partial and imperfect approach from the sea to the district capital of Minab: its mouth is situated about 38 miles east by south of Bandar ’Abbas and 19 miles west by south of Minab town. The bar of the creek is nearly dry at low water.. The Khur runs inland at first in a north-easterly direc tion for H miles through sand and mud flats, then for 2 miles south-east wards between banks overgrown with mangroves, and finally for 4 miles to the east-north-east to its head, where is situated Tiab, described else where among the villages of the Minab district, the landing-place for Minab town and an Imperial Persian Customs station. A mud flat continues 2 miles beyond Tiab in the direction of Minab town, between which and the landing stage, goods are transported on camels and donkeys. At. certain seasons there is a considerable trade, as many as 20 boats arriving and leaving on the same day ; these are mostly from Qishm and Bandar Abbas, but a few are from the coast of Arabia and even from India. I he Minab creek makes an indifferent harbour • the bar as already mentioned is shallow, while the inner channel, which at its head degenerates into a mere ditch, cannot be used by native boats exceeding 20 tons’ burden, and at low water is impracticable even for these. During a shimdl vessels can neither enter nor leave Khur Minab and accidents in attempting to do so are not uncommon.— {L:rimer, 1906.) MINAB or MINAU (District)— A comparatively rich and important but not a very extensive district the first of those on the Persian side within the entrance of the Persian Gulf; it is situated between the Persian littoral district of Shamil on the north and that of Biaban on the south. The Minab district is bounded on the west by the sea ; on the north by Limits . a . line running from the mouth of the Shan il river to the Zindan hills so as to pass im mediately north of the village of Mian Shahr; on the east by the crest of the Zindan hills till the village of Garuk is almost reached. At this point the boundary turns to the south-west and passing between the villages of Taling and Garuk leaves the village of Guvasmand in Biaban and then runs westward by southward to the sea between Ziarat in Minab and Bundram in Biaban. With th ue limits the district has a length of about 45 miles and a depth inland at about 25. The Minab district is a plain reaching from the foot of the hills on the Physical characteristics and east to the sea. The coast generally is low and climate - _ swampy, with a number of creeks too small to admit native craft of more than medium size and containing as a rule only salt-water ; of these the principal is Khur Minab, which is elsewhere described under its own name. Near the coast the country is everywhere a saline416 MIN—MIN swamp bearing only coarse grass and tamarisk bushes or, m the immediate neighbourhood of the sea, mangroves. The north-western corner of the district inland from the coast is a sandy desert so strongly impregnated with salt that nothing can grow in it. The remainder oi the district is fertile and well cultivated by dint of irrigation from the Mmab river and other smaller streams from the hills. , The Minab river has at Mmab town a bed-width of 400 to 600 yards and usuallv carries a fair volume of water. _ In March the stream flows about 1 foot deep and 200 yards wide ; in summer it is drained almost dry by various irrigation canals, while in winter it runs at a higher level and sometimes becomes difficult of passage. Little water at ordinary times reaches the sea through the mouth of the river which is on the coast about 7 miles south-east of the entrance of Khur Minab. The principal canals depending on the Minab river are one which takes off from the right bank at Basreh and waters several villages to the west and another which leaves the left bank and runs through Minab town to some of the southern vil lages. The water of the river is good and drinkable. The only other streams in the district deserving of notice are the Mazavi, with a broad but shallow flow, which crosses the district to the sea several miles south of the Minab river, and the Chahlak stream which disembogues 1 mile to the south of Kuhistak. The hills forming the eastern boundary of the district and called Kuh-i- Zindan—or in the north where they adjoin the Rudb2r district Kuh-i- Rudbar—are rugged of outline and barren of vegetation, except for a few her trees. By natives Minab is considered to be much healthier than Bandar Abbas, and shade and flowing water combine to render it at least cooler. In summer many Bandar Abbasis migrate to Minab town to escape the terrible heat of their own. But mosquitoes abound, and even early in March are sometimes so numerous as to make life a burden. Rain is said to fall more copiously in Minib than on any other part of the Persian coast within 150 miles on either side of it. A majority of the inhabitants of the Minab district are Persians of mixed descent, a Baluch strain predominating among opu.a ion. the foreign elements in their composition ; the rest are for the most part genuine Baluchis or Arabs who are believed to have immigrated from Bahrain. Their total number, inclusive of the permanent inhabitants of Minab town, may be placed at 26,000 souls. The most part are SLi’ahs, Sunnis being found only among the Baluchis and the Arab immi grants. The topographical table at the; end of this article will make plain in detail the distribution of the population and their means of livelihood. In the interior all are date-growers, stock-raisers or ordinary agriculturists ; on the coast there are some fishermen and sailors. The people on the whole are fairly well-to-do, most of them inhabit mud-brick houses, only the poorest labourers occupying the date-leaf huts which in some adjoining, districts are the commonest form of dwelling. The character of the people is less degraded than in the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas—a circum stance which is attributed to the less direct and oppressive form which the Persian Government here assumes; as agriculturists they are reputedMINAB— Resources. Water .—The district of Minab is situated at the foot of a lofty range of hills of which it receives the drainage, and this supplemented by wells gives it an ample water-supply, especially after good winter rains. Dykes have been constructed in places by the villagers to store water, which is subsequently distributed over the date groves. Trade.—Rerms. is exported to India and some dates, but none of the latter has as yet been put on the European market: some samples were, however, despatched to London in autumn, 1911. There are some 20 or 25 Hindus established there who export dates, henna, wool, ghi, and of course do an extensive money-lending business, the bulk of the local population being financed by them at very high rates of interest. There are also two or three families of Khoja British subjects there, who own considerable property and export to India. A dministration. During the first four months of 1911 a rapid succession of nominees of the Deputy Governor of Bandar ’Abbas, each more incompetent than the last, were appointed as Sub-Governors at Minab: in May, however, one Kar- balai Muhammad Hasan was appointed to that post, and remained there till December when he left, on account of bad health. His tenure of the appointment was a marked contrast to that of his predecessors : no dis turbances occurred and, owing in a large measure to his energy and tact large amounts due to British subjects were recovered. The seat of the Local Governor is “ Kaleh ”, the most important village in the district, situated some 12 or 14 miles inland.— (Bis^oe, 1911.)MIN—MIN 41! thrifty and careful. The language of the district is a local patois com pounded of Persian, Arabic and Baluchi, Persian words predominating But few arms are carried or owned in Minab, though the district was until lately upon a highroad of the rifle-trade with Afghanistan and* Baluchistan. The staple industry is the cultivation of dates, but wheat and barley, l Agriculture and Trade. besides henna, vegetables and fruits such as i , • . citrons, limes, lemons, oranges, mangoes and plantains, are grown in considerable quantities. The chief facts about trade are given m the article on Minab town, which is the only trade-centre in the district; here it may be added that an illicit trade with Afghanistan and Baluchistan m imported rifles which formerly flourished here has now been all but suppressed by the reformed Customs administration. Communication and trans- The principal routes in the district are four P ort - as follows :— (1) A portion of the coast-route between Minab and Bandar Abbas : this is the continuation of Route No. 1 of the paragraph on com- munications in the article on the Shamil district, and no further remarks are necessary here, except that the two stages within the Minab district are Dudau at 14 miles from Minab town and 16 from Qulughan in the Shamil district. (2) A small portion of the route between Minab town and Shamil village lies in the Minab district; vide Route No. 4 in the paragraph and article already cited. It will be seen, on refer ence to Route No. 5 in the same place, that travellers proceed ing froin Minab town to Bam or Kirman might go by Shamil village, joining the Bandar Abbas-Kirman route at Tang-i- Zindan. (3) There is a route over the hills from Minab town by the Gardaneh Asia! and Murad Kushteh passes to Manujan, whence, as ex plained under Route No. 4 in the passage cited above, ways lie to Sistan and Khorasan. (4) The route to Jashk runs from Minab town to Ealavi (26 miles) by Kokogaz, Hazarmani, Kahatak Majbun and Dahi Qand ; there is also a route a few miles shorter by Hazarmani, Ju Mahalleh and Dahi Qand. The continuation beyond Kalavi is given in the paragraph on communi cations in the article on the Biaban district. The above routes are no better than those of South-Eastern Persia gen erally ; but in dry weather they are free from difliculty for mounted men and pack animals at least until they enter the hilly country. A rough estimate of the land transport owned in the Mine.b district shows about 1,000 camels, and 1,000 donkeys. As will appear from the village-list at the end of this article, the number of boats belonging to the coast villages is inconsiderable. The district is ruled by an official who has his seat at Minab town Administration. ^ e .._ is f P re fent a nominee of the Mu’in-uG lujjar of Tehran who holds the district in farm rrom the Persian Central Government.

The local Sub-Governor dispenses a rude form of criminal and * civil justice, and is responsible for the collection annually of 14,000 turadns as land-revenue. Except this mdlidt or land-revenue no taxes are collected in the district, which in this respect is more fortunate than Shamil or Bandar Abbas. The Agent’s behests are enforced by means of a small corps of about 30 Tufangchis, and about 20 rifles of regula' Persian Infantry are stationed in the district to support the authority of the Imperial Persian Customs* _ _ &gt; . The operations of the Imperial Customs establishment in the district are supervised by a Persian Mudir stationed at Minab town ; he has under his orders a post at Tiab and another at Kuhistak.

Elev. 378/ The capital of the Minab district, and the only populous or important place near the Persian Coa*t anywhere east of Bandar Abbas; it issituated about 28 miles south-south-east of Shamil village and nearly 50 miles due east of Bandar Abbas, at a distance of about 15 miles in a direct line from the nearest point on the sea. Minab stands on the left bank of the Minab riverand is immediately commanded on the east side by some hills which rise to 640 feet and carry a large but very dilapidated fort overlooking the town; the whole hill side is covered with remains of towers, bastions and walls. The greater part of the town consists of mat huts, but at the foot of the hill on which the fort stands is a quarter, about 5 acres in extent, with many good and substantial houses ; this quarter was originally enclosed, but the wall which surrounded it has now almost entirely disappeared, only the towers and bastions which belonged to it remaining in situ. On the south side are extensive plantations and gardens and here begins ah enormous date- belt, about 6 miles in breadth, which follows the course of the Minab river to within a few miles of the sea. There are in all not less than 2,000 houses in Mlnab town, and the popula tion may be estimated at 10,000 souls in summer, when the place is partly occupied by immigrants from Bandar Abbas, Hormuz and the adjoining rural districts : the minimum winter population possibly does not exceed 7,000. The inhabitants. $re described as civil and obliging : the majority of them are Persians of no particular tribe and are Shi’ahs, a considerable propor tion of them being natives of the Rudbar district upon the upper course of the Minab river. Large numbers of Arabs and Negroes also are among the inhabitants and there are at present 14 Hindus and 17 Khojahs also, who are British subjects. Almost the entire population is dependent on date and fruit culture, but a few are engaged in the manufacture of lungis or coloured check cloth, and others live by trade. Dates, tobacco, henna, oranges, citrons, lemons, plantains and mangoes are grown, and the town can furnish about 200 donkeys, 300 camels and 400 cattle. The bazar is large and better supplied than that of Bandar Abbas, and carpenters and blacksmiths are here obtainable. Exports consist chiefly of dates, corn, vegetable, fruits, henna, wool, ghi and hides, while imports include piece-goods, rice, sugar, tea, kerosine oil and dried fish : a portion of the trade really belongs to the Rudbar district in the interior which produces the greater part of the wool, grMand hides exported. The town is the only trade-centre of the Mlnab district, its currency, weights and measures are indentical with those of Bandar Abbas. About 100 Indian maunds of wheat might be obtained, and 20,000 Indian maunds of dates, but flour is scarce. Supplies of all kinds are procur able at Minab. Water which is from the Minab river and canals dependent on it, is good and abundant. There are a few wells. The Deputy-Governor of the Minab district has his residence here, and there is an inspector of the Imperial Customs; the authority of both is sup ported by the presence of a small detachment of 20 Persian infantry. There are shrines ofHazrat ’Abbas, Zain-ul-Abidin, and Shah Wali. The elements of a Muhammadan education are imparted in two or three mosques : these are the only tuitional establishments.— {Lorimer, 1906.)

MlRJAwA— Elev. 2,800'. A small area of arable soil in Sarhad, 11 miles north-east of Ladis and about 70 miles south-south-east of Kuh-i-Malik Siah. Of recent years considerable attention has been drawn to this spot, as being a place of great geographical and strategical importance along a dis puted frontier ; and as it is possible that it may yet again come into promi nence, the events with regard to it will be here related in some detail. In 1895 a convention was signed by the Indian and Bersian Governn enfs regarding the alignment of the Perso-Baluch frontier, from Kuhak to Kuh- i-Malik Siah—the mountain where the Bersian, Indian and Afghan frontiers meet. To give effect to this agreement a British Commission under Colonel (now Sir Thomas) Holdich assembled at Kuhak in February 1896, and, in conjunction with the Persian Commissioners, commenced to delimitate the frontier which had already been decided on at Tehran. The Commission proceeded as far as Jalk, erecting boundary pillars along the Siahan range as they went, but north of Jalk they were unable to go, owing to pressure of time, and the rapid approach of the hot weather. A native surveyor, however, was directed to continue by double marches as far as Kuh-i-Malik Siah, and to erect pillars along the proposed boundary, on spots which had been roughly indicated on the then existing maps, but which were not strictly in accordance with the terms of the Tehran Treaty—being placed considerably more to the east than had been contemplated by the Indian and Persian Govern ments. The maps also were inaccurate, and did not represent the true features of the country. It thus happened that in reality four boundaries were in existence, viz., that in the agreement; that on a composite map, put together to reconcile discrepancies ; that on the sketch map signed by the Commissioners ; and that on the ground ; while it was not possible to reconcile the agreement with the features as they really existed. The boundary actually demarcated by Colonel Holdich, ran from Kuhak along the Siahan Kuh, thence to the east of Jalk and northwards up to Pillar No. 11, as marked on the map. From there it followed the course of the so-called Talab river, to a point where the Mlrjawa rivec432 MIR—MIR j Talab and thence branched off along the crest r t rS&gt;a Vrto the S^i Malik Siah. Such a point of junction however retween the two rivers does not exist ; with the result that th'ose in the neighbourhood of Mirjawa a small area of country, the °TetLl te ^1^X7 Ues in the fact that the Boundary Com- milsioners were mistaken in supposing that the true Talab river flowed P ast M r “wa and that the so-called Mirjawa river ran m a clear well-defined xviirjawa, anu It, rpalitv it is the Dar-i-Ghiaban which runs past course mto the Talab. In reality _ir ib iaie 1 i ii it t^Si-mi'lnd' “nett o^The Eihi , 28 milesLlow Kaleh Safid or according to other authorities, the Talab spring, 41 miles below Kaleh Safid. At the first named place water ooz^up for the first time in the bed of the river, and forms pools (Talab) from which its nomenclature is derived. &lt; ._ _ i,• ,• • The Dar-i-Ghiaban river, where it passes the Mirjawa cultivation, is an insignificant dry sandy ndld bed, only 20 yards wide and about 2 fee ^The Ladis river on issuing from the hills, spreads out into a wide fan slooimr to the Dar-i-Ghiaban, and the stream, which at first has a consider able volume of water, gradually diminishes, but seldom entirely dries up. The lower portion of this stream is sometimes called the Mirjawa river, but there is no indication whatsoever of a main channel running down this deltaic fan, which is here a series of shallow gravel ndlds radiating bom the upper Ladis river valley to the Dar-i-Ghiaban. In flood time its waters spill broadcast over the fan right down to the Dar-i-Ghiaban, so that it is impossible to say where at any particular point is the junction of the Ladis or Mirjawa river with the Dar-i-Ghiaban. _ In April 1901, owing to depredations of Damani marauders, and their threatening attitude with regard to the Nushki-Sistan trade route, Captain Webb-Ware, Political Assistant, Chagai, thought it advisable to establish a levy post in the neighbourhood of .Mirjawa, which he did on the right bank of the Dar-i-Ghaiban, in the angle formed, by the above named river and the most northerly of the ndlds into which the Mirjawa river divides. This is a spot, which, owing to the absence of definite boundaries, might well fall within the British border. . _ He subsequently prevented a Belgian Customs Post being established there, on the grounds that it was not Persian territory, and that one had already been formed at Ladis, which was fully able to deal with all existing ^ Meanwhile representations had been made by the Persian to the British Government against the so-called violation of Persian territory, and as a con sequence, the levy post at Mirjawa was evacuated and destroyed on the 4th April 1902, and a new one established on the left bank of the Dar-i-Ghiaban, opposite Mirjawa, on ground over which there could be no dispute. This new post was called Padaha, to distinguish it from the demolished post at Mirjawa, though there is also another Padaha between Ladis and Mirjawa, with which it is liable to be confused. The Persian Customs Pos was at the same time moved from Ladis to Mirjawa, and placed under Sistan. , . ... .Unfortunately no water is procurable at the new post of Padaha, so that the garrison there is dependent for its supply on a tank on the Persian side of the river, which is a mile distant, and which is filled from the perennial flow of the Ladis river. Meanwhile negotiations had been going on with the Persian Government for a realignment of the doubtful boundaries from Pillar No. 11, north- wa;rds, and Commissioners had been appointed on both sides to investigate the matter, and to adjust, if possible, the differences between the Tehran agreement and the Holdich award. Later, owing to the improbability of any satisfactory settlement being arrived at in the re-delimitation of the frontier, the question of the Com missioners meeting was allowed to drop, a compromise was effected, and an agreement signed on 13th May 1905 between the British and Persian Governments on the following terms— (1) The British claim to the ownership of Mirjawa, put forward in 1902, to be withdrawn. The Persians on their side to permit the gar rison at Padaha to procure (“ using buckets or water-skins for the purpose ’ ’) the supply of water that may be necessary for it from the wells or tank situated at or near Mirjawa. question of the further examination of the frontier line to be abandoned, and it shall be regarded as definitely settled in accordance with the agreement of 1896, and no further claim made in respect of it. Persian Government will permit the inhabitants of the frontier villages of Mirjawa, Lad is and Duzdab to sell supplies (to the annual amount of 700 Tabriz kharwdrsoi grain) to the British outposts on the Indian side of the frontier, and will also allow the unrestricted export of 1,500 Tabriz kharwdrs of grain, and 50 Tabriz kharwdrs of ghi annually from Sistan, for the use of the British frontier station of Kala Robat, and others along the Nushki route. (4) The above provision applies only to normal j^ears, when the locality is not suffering from actual famine due to destruction of its crops by locusts, blight or other exceptional visitation. The actual name of Mirjawa is given to a small area (about 1 mile long and half a mile wide) of alluvial and arable soil in the delta of the Ladis river, where it joins the Dar-i-Ghiaban. Formerly a somewhat larger tract was cultivated, as is shown by the ruins of an old village or fort called Mirjawa Kaleh, about 2 miles up the fan from the Dar-i-Ghiaban. Its strategical importance lies in the fact that it is at the junction of three routes which turn the Kuh-i-Taftan, on its east side, for any force advancing from the north (i) from Ladis via Sangun, (u) from Ladis via Andai and Gazu, {in) along the border via Guram and Maksotag. A post at Mirjawa would control the trade along these roads, as well as along those to Jalk and Dizak, and would serve as a considerable protection to the Nushki route against Damani raiders. It would also serve as a menace to any possible Russian railway, connect ing their present Asiatic system with the Gulf.— {Showers* 1902 ; Webb- Ware, 1902 ; McMahon, 1905.) I. B.

It forms part of the administrative district of Bani-Narm£hlr {q v ). It contains or is said to contain 500 villages, large and small. Many ol these villages are mere farms with a dozen inhabitants, and the whole district is parcelled out among less than ten owners, who are all wealthy Bami Khans. Supplies in moderate quantities are obtainable almost everywhere and water is abundant. Prom each village beaten paths and tracks radiate to all the points of the compass and it is consequently possible to traverse the district from end to end several times each time using a distinct route. The prosperity of the district depends entirely on the cultivation of henna.— 1907.) NARF— A village of 20 houses, miles south of Kagar {q.v.) in the Kirman district. NARZ —See Fadumi. NASARABAD— Elev. 4,200'. A place permanently occupied by nomads, 6 miles east of Vasht. There are some 30 ghiddns and a small amount of cultivated land*. The people own about 1,000 sheep and goats, a few camels and donkeys* and some 25 head of cattle. There is a good perennial supply of water through a hdnz from Kuh-i-Panj Angusht. Supplies scanty.—(Rm^er- Creagh, 1891.) f Not marked on map.in a valley, 7 miles broad, which in wet weather is completely under water, and in dry weather is so thickly covered with saline efflorescence as to wear the appearance of being deep in snow. It is the furthest inhabited spot on the north-east frontier of the Kirman province, and is purely a government place, maintained for the protection of kafilehs passing to and from Sistan. The settlement consists of a mud fort with walls 30 feet high, and forti fied with nine round towers and a bdla khaneh. Each face is 100 yards long, and the place can accommodate 350 men. Originally strongly built, it was in rather a ruinous state when Dobbs visited it in 1902, owing to recent heavy rain. In 1905 further damage was done by an earthquake, which destroyed the fortified walls, and the majority of the population now live in huts which they have constructed outside. The remains of an earlier fort lie to the north of the present site. There are four houses of Persians, who live on Government ground near the forts, also 30 houses of Ilidt Baluchis who live on the Kuh-i-Khul in summer. They are scattered about in huts in the tagaz jungle. There is a Persian telegraph office with a ghulam in charge. The inhabitants are not soldiers, but a sort of levies, who were impressed from Narmashir, and originally were not allowed to have their wives or female relatives with them. They number about 100, the garrison of regular troops consisting of one sultan (captain), one naib (lieutenant), and ten sarbdzes. A portion of the salt swamp surrounding the settlement has been reclaimed. The cultivated area, which covers about 10 acres, but which might be largely extended, is irrigated by a good gandt of slightly brackish water, and produces annually about 300 mans of cotton and 1,400 mans of wheat and barley. This suffices for the needs of the post, but leaves little over for the use of caravans. The place is surrounded by a gaz and tapaz jungle. There are also other descriptions of trees and shrubs affording good grazing for camels. There is a sort of coarse grass in plenty for donkeys. Livestock consist of 4 cows, 2 oxen, and some camels. The water is brought in qandts from the Malusan range, and, though brackish, is quite drinkable. It is said to have been found on analysis by a European doctor to contain the eggs of the guinea-worm ; this disease, however, appears to be unknown among the inhabitants. In the neigh bouring hills are two or three thermal sulphur springs, with a surface tem perature of 75° F., which have a reputation for the cure of skin diseases. There is a well m the neighbourhood of the telephone house, the water of which is not very brackish. The depth of the well is about 18 feet, and water about 12 inches. There is an old qandt the water of which is said to have been good and sweet, but it was destroyed by an earthquake about 1905. The Baluchis have also a well about \ mile from the telephone house, the water of which resembles that of the other well.

It is situatedatthe junction of roads to Birjand, Bandar Abb as, Kirman and Sistan. They follow two valleys separated from each other by a narrow 'ridge,'and down these valleys the wind sweeps with terrible violence. The village contains 700 houses, but is often almost entirely deserted during the summer months. The windmills to the north of the village, some 40 m number, are worthy of notice. As they are only used at certain times Windmills. 0 f the year,—principally in autumn after the harvest,—they are arranged so as to utilize the north-east wind, which is the prevailing wind at that season.

PARED— A ydlage and small district in Persian Baluchistan, forming a division of fearbaz. To the north is Sarbaz proper : to the east Murtan or Murtaneh • to the south Pishin: and to the west Qasrqand. It is a hilly tract* consisting of the lower part of the upper basin of the Sarbaz river (o v ) and resembles in Ts general characteristics Sarbaz proper, which it adjoins It is, however, more open as well as considerably lower, varying in eleva* tion from 2,800 feet in the north to 1,400 feet in the south. Its situation' no doubt, has given rise to its name, which is strictly speaking Pd-i-Rud the foot of the stream.” ’ The products of Parud are those of Sarbaz generally {see Sarbaz) and include dates, beans, barley and rice, all of which ripen somewhat earlier than at Sarbaz itself. The fruits are mango, orange, and mulberry. * Our information on this point is vague. The limits U ? del i x! lat name ’ are probably pretty correct, but there is considerable uncertain tv about the exact political status of the country between the districts of Sarba 7 nrnnpr and Pishin. It was all under Ha an Khan, chief of Sarbaz, at the time of Goldsmid’s Mission yl871), but whether Parud has a minor chief of its own and whether hia district includes Flruzabad and Hash, is not positively known. In HaiT ’AhrhU chief of^srqan? FirQz5bM was quite Se P arate from Sarbaz and belonged to thef ,, ff r ■ * '&lt; [f / f 462 PAR—PAK As in Sarbaz proper, the chief feature of the district is the Sarhaz river which runs from Diphur (q-v.) in a general south-easterly direction, till it emerges from the hills below Rask. In this part of its course its bed is wider than above, in Sarbaz proper, and is much more stony with less water running. The hills also are lower, and stand further back from the river, forming a valley in contradistinction to the defiles above. The river winds from side to side through patches of cultivation and palm groves. Five or six villages lie along the banks above Parud itself. Of these we have the names of Ghafar Khan {q.v.) and Tejak. Below are other hamlets and the considerable villages of Firuzabad and Rask, all with cultivation and groves of date palm. &gt; . Parud village is described as a strange looking place situated on a high bluff on the left bank of the river, which seems here to terminate, as it makes a detour at right angles to the left (east), and the two banks merge as it were into one to the eye of the downward traveller. Euan-Smith thinks it is probably from this appearance that the place received its name. A broad watercourse from the west joins the Sarbaz at the angle above mentioned. Euan-Smith says it comes from Qasrqand, but this is of course a misapprehension. According to the map it would seem to origi' nate in the “ Sagar Kuh,” a large hill conspicuously marked atoong the lesser ranges, about 20 miles west-north-west of Parhd and 11 or 12 miles west-south-west of Diphur. The village consists of the usual ruined mud fort and about 80 mud huts, with a poor population. The road from Sarbaz winds up from the river-bed through the village on to a stony plateau, where the camp of Sir F. Goldsmid’s mission was pitched in 1871. Its elevation is probably about 2,200 feet. The people all about seemed to have a great fear of Ibrahim Khan, who was as much hated as feared, and whose rule wa s by no means firmly established. They stated that when their revenue was not made up he took a girl or two and sold them as slaves : and we heard that in these parts the price of a young man of about 25 was 12 tiimans” Parud village is 26 miles from Sarbaz, with an intermediate halt at Diphur, 12 miles, Pishin is about 39 miles (three stages): and Bahu- Kalat on the Chahbar road, dividing from that to Pishin at Rask, is about 5 stages, or 60 miles. Rask is 14 miles down the river, passing Firuzabad {q.v.) at about 9 miles. Haji ’Abdul Nabi followed a direct road from Qasrqand to Parud, distance about 40 miles, halting midway at Ushaf {q.v ), which may be conjectured to be near the source of the water course above mentioned as entering Sarbaz from the west. Next to nothing is known of this history of Parud. It has certainly been in Persian possession, along with Sarbaz, since 1850. Haji ’Abdul Nabi, who visited it in 1839, says that twenty years before, a Persian detach ment succeeded in levying 700 ducats (Rs. 3.850) “by means of a gun they aad with them.” In 1839 the chief was Mulla Miah, Bulidi. His revenue vas 30 ducats (Rs. 165) and 2,000 maunds of grain. But the maund is probably the local man of 3| lb to 4 lb. The rate at which the revenue in kind was levied varied from one-tenth to one-fifth and even one-third of the produce. It was considered so oppressive that most of the cultivatorshad fled to Balm. Mulla Miah was in alliance with his 'neighbour bhah Din Muhammad, Malukzai Bulidi, of Qasrqand and Firuzabad : and at enmity with the powerful Muhammad Shah of Sib. Hap ’Abdul Nabi gives the following list of the villages belonging to Parud in 1839—it must be remembered that Firuzabad and its dependent hamlets then belonged to Qasrqand-—Kosolakan, Duzhalakan, Jamidar, Bafanan, PItan, Sahabad, Budban, Zlaiat Jah, Ganjabad, Hait and Balahan. —{Haji 'Abdul Nabi; Goldsmid Euan-Smith.)

PASGA or PAZGA— A small river or stream in Persian Baluchistan, which, rising in the Band-i-Nflag range, drains a considerable portion of the hilly country west of Bint, and eventually joins the Gidich river {q.v.). The Pasga appears to have at first a general south-easterly course. It is crossed by the road from Bint to Jashk at between 23 and 24 miles from the former place, that is, at between 13 and 14 miles from Gari Darap. Here it flows in a broad valley full of trees and shrubs. The river-bed is about a quarter of a mile wide and contains much tall bash (pampas grass) growing to a height of 13 feet. The Siga Pusht Kaur joins here on the left bank, and on the right bank is the Siga Pusht hill round which the road goes. {See Siga Pusht.) The river appears to go away to the eastward. After 4 miles of travelling through a mass of shur and other hills, the road descends the difficult Ridagun Darag defile and again comes on the Pasga, which has come round from where first struck, and is now found running in a westerly, or north-westerly, direction. The stream is here 20 feet wide, with an average depth of 1 foot. Two large snow-white boulders stand in mid-stream. Floyer describes the scenery about here as magnificent. Crossing the river, the road rounds the Kalkia hill and in about half a mile again crosses the river having come round the northern end of the hill: thence through hills and for a short distance along the Kalkia stream till the river is again reached, running almost west. The valley is here narrowed to half a mile, but immediately widens to a much greater breadth. On either side are low broad hills and shurs. The road follows the valley, and at 3 miles from the last crossing, or 21 from Gar Parilp, is a Tcdfileh halting-place on the right bank, immediately opposite a §ttikipg rock, called Kunar Kahnu. Here the Pasga appears to make464 PAS-PAS a sharp bend from west to south-east, in which direction it continues till it joins the Gidich : the united stream afterwards falling into the Rapch or Bint river {q.v.). There is nothing grand about the view here, the hills being low, and the river split into three channels, all hidden in dense pampas and “ kik ” grasses, mixed with tamarisk, oleander and other bushes. The Pasga is said to be a perennial stream, but this is not quite certain. The above description is from Floyer, who saw it in January 1876. There is always plenty of water in winter, and floods are not uncommon, when the river may be impassable for a day or two. If there has not been much rain in winter the river may cease running in the hot weather, but numerous pools of water would probably be found under any circumstances. At the above mentioned camping-ground the road from Kashi and Karvan on the south meets that from Jashk.— (Floyer.) It is not certain whether the Pasga originates in the Band-i-Nilag range. It may possibly come from beyond it like the Sadaich, which is only 7 miles west of the Icafileh camping-ground. PASHAMAG, KUH-I A large hill in Makran, 27 miles south of Sarbaz, and 12 miles east of the road from that place to Bask. It is said to be the head-quarters of Sardar Husain Khan.— (Wood, 1899.) PASKGH— Elev. 3,846'. A village and small district in Dizak 63| miles from Vasht, 29J from Magas, 35 from Sib, and 53 from Dizak. The village consists of from 80 to 150 houses, collected round an old fort at the north-eastern end of an extensive date grove. It has a great reputation for healthiness and fertility. A perennial stream of good limestone water irrigates a consider able amount of arable land. This stream, the Bud Gurk, rises in the Murghak hills, and flows via Suran and Sib to join the Magas river. Supplies are procurable in moderation, as w^ell as fruit and vegetables^ Good rough material for suitings can be bought at reasonable rates. The inhabitants are estimated at 800, and comprise Nodizai, Sandakzai, Chahari- zai, Mazarzai, Grhamshadzai, and Shadadzai, and are probably of aboriginal (Dravidian) descent. In the village are 12 weavers, 3 iron workers, 5 shoemakers, 2 carpenters, 1 Hindu baniah. Roads meet here from. Rindigan, Vasht, Gusht, Sib and Magas.— (Brazier-Creaqh, 1893 ; Sykes, 1893—1902.)

PERSIAN (GULF)— A gulf which runs in from the Indian Ocean, between Persia and Arabia It extends from latitude 24° to 30° 20' and longitude 48° to 56° 30'. Its greatest length from Ras Jashk to the mouth of Shatt-al- Arab is I ^b0 miles, and its breadth varies from 150 to 300 miles. It communicates with the Indian Ocean by the Straits of Hormuz, which are 35 miles wide. Fishery forms a most important industry, next, indeed, to pearl fishing throughout the whole of the Persian Gulf. The fishing localities appear to be principally on the Arab coast, but the sea about the island of Qishm, off the coast of Lar, is one of these. The total number of boats engaged in fishing in the gulf has been calculated at 6,600, and the number of men at 46,380. On the Persian side the fishing boats are subject to a tax of 8 krdns per boat j)er annum, except for the smallest kind. But this tax is subject to variations, according to the pleasure of local governors. At Lingeh, for instance, the large boats pay 10 dollars per annum, and each fisherman 2 dollars in addition. A rough estimate of the fish caught is 160,000 tons per annum.—{Colonel Ross’ Report, 1881.)PET—PIB 46 T fill Ghar west IS, fifi i tie ppeai felnn, igaged itineD Mfi PETAK,— see Sarkaur (River). . : r PIB or PIP— Elev. 3,300'. The capital of Lashar, in Persian Baluchistan, situated nearly in the centre of a valley some 6 miles long by 3 broad, surrounded by hills, 49 miles north of Geh and 55 miles south of Bampur. Scattered over the valley are the following villages and date groves:— Vashmaqan, Jakkas, Patkun, Piz, Gurdahan, Kuch Khan, Hari Dug, Han Dak, Rus, and Surmich. Pib village consists of some 200 houses and huts, huddled together round a small mud fort (of no importance) quite in the open, with no date or other trees round. Population 1,000. Supplies are plentiful. There is a considerable amount of cultivation both here and in the other villages, and the tribes esources. OWn p ar g e flocks of sheep and goats. The soil is good and impregnated with lime, and, being well irrigated, superior crops are produced. Fig, mulberry, grape, and pomegranate are seen, also the castor and cotton plants. Lucerne and bean crops grow well. Water is abun dant and good. Fuel and camel-grazing plentiful. Climate reported to be healthy. The following bearings of points were taken from Pib :— Kuh-i-Gatak, 204°. Kuh-i-Yazbag or Nilag, 265°. Kuh-i-Bazman, 357°. Kuh-i-Shlsheh Pusht, 48°. Kuh-i-Suhran, 56°. Kuh-i-Dahan, 75°. The lofty pyramidal Bazman peak is called here Zind-i-Pir. Kafileh routes run respectively east and west from Pib to Qasrqand via Champ (two stages) and to Fanuch and Bint via Maskhutan. The Lasharis are different from other Baluch tribes in being taller and physically finer men. They have a wild, indepen dent, frank appearance, with clear-cut features and long ringlets. When seen armed and mounted on fast-stepping camels, they present a warlike appearance. They are of nomadic tendencies, and wander about with their flocks, only returning to their villages during the date harvest and to cultivate the ground, and then again wandering afar. Six miles north from Pib on the road to Isfakeh the following villages are passed. A village of some 50 flat-roofed mud houses and huts, with the remains of an old mud fort, some 20 acres of rich cultivat ed soil and a date grove. The crops are parti cularly good : jowari, lucerne, cotton, beans, onions and tobacco are seen in the gardens, also fig and mulberry trees and castor plant.

A part of the same range as the Bampusht Kuh (q.v.) with which it is united (westwards) by Sagarkand and Mazampusht. The name Pimpiska is attached on the map to what looks like a considerable peak, but Lovett remarks : e ‘ We crossed the continuation of the Bampusht range to the east ; it was here of no great breadth, consisting only of three or four ridges, from the principal one of which, called ‘ Pimpiska, ’ we obtained the direction of Kuhak and Tang.” The elevation of Pimpiska is certainly muen less than that of Sagarkand, and may be taken at between 4,000 and 5,000 feet. Eastwards Pimpiska is continued by low broken ridges which join it to the Kashani Kuh and the range bounding Panjgur on the south. The road from Panjgur to Bolida and Kej, via Diz, crosses Pimpiska. It passes through narrow defiles at the foot of the Pimpiska peak. Hie Pimpiska part of the range is entirely within Kalat territory. To the south is the saline plain lying to the east of Diz, and to the north the country (a part of what is called the Dasht of Panjgur) is inconceivably arid, barren and desolate looking. PINJEH— .

QASIMABAD— Elev. 1,530'. A small village of some 20 huts, in Persian Baluchistan 9 miles west of Bampur. , The place presents a squalid and desolate appearance. The people are of the Durzadehs tribe (cross-bred, i.e., father Baluch and mother negro, or vice versa) and are all slaves of the Governor of Bampur. Forage, fuel and abundant and good river-water are procurable ; other supplies are scant. North of the village, between it and the river, there is a good deal of cultivated ground, stretching away upon both banks (but mostly on the north bank) to F hru. All this is Crown land, farmed by the Governor of Bampu”, and tilled by these slaves, who receive but a bare subsistence in return for their labour. A condition of extreme anaemia and wretchedness is the natural consequence. The bulk of the pro duce, some 850,000 mans, is stored for the consumption of the garrison and for sale. A roabl from Bazman to Champ via Surmich (5 jarsakhs south-south-east) crosses here. The river is fordable, except during heavy rain, which often causes a delay of a few days.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.)

QASRQAND— Lat. 26° 14' 8'; Long. 60° 41' 43'; Elev. 1,770'. A large village in Makran, capital of a small sub-district of that name, and situated on the eastern bank of the Kaju 1 a ® C ‘ river, and at the western end of the Qasrqand valley. It consists of a large square fort, surrounded by a number of mud-built houses and wattle and clay huts ; it contains a population of some 1,800 persons, mostly Baluchis, who seem a well-to-do and polite community. In the vicinity are extensive and scattered date-groves with considerable cultivation, the huts of the inhabitants being grouped in tens and twenties among the trees. Supplies of all sorts are procurable in large quantities, such as wheat, rice, dates, barley, millet, tobacco, beans, ghi, etc., etc.; while fruit of manykinds are plentiful in season, sueli as lemons, figs, pomegranates, grapes, mangoes, etc. Unlimited water can be got from the Kaju river, while a little to the north-east are seven springs and several qaviats. Forage and fuel are abundant, and sheep can be bought from the nomads. Camels and donkeys can be hired for transport purposes at Ee. 1 per diem ; while some coolies and two carpenters are available for labour. The climate is said to be fairly healthy, the recorded temperatures being in April 1900, at noon, 89° ; at 6 p.m., 80° ; and in May 1900, at noon, 104°. On an eminence overlooking the village are the remains of an old fort which in 1839 was described as being dilapidated ; it is now in mins. The prices of supplies in August 1906 were as follows :— Flour (wheat) .. .. 14 seers (Indian) the rupee (supply un ertain).

Rs. 1-8 to Rs. 4 „ Sugar Eggs .. 11 annas the seer- 4 ,, ,, dozen ' (scarce). Fowls .. 4 ,, each There are four Shikarpuri Hindu shops in the town. The town consists of a mud fort and some 300 houses of which some hundred are of mud with thatched roofs the remainder being huts made of rice straw and palm leaves, scattered through the date-groves. The place is noted for its mosquitoes, as a consequence malaria is common. Even the poorest inhabitants sleep under muslin mosquito curtains during the hot months. From the village of Qasrqand, routes radiate in various directions, which used to make it an important trading Routes ' centre in the twelfth century, when Tiz was a flourishing fort. The principal routes at present are ; (1) to Bampur, 102 miles (Route 45) ; (2) to Gwadar, ICO miles ; (3) to Tank, 101 miles ; (4) to Sarbaz, 82 miles (Route 34) ; (5) to Geh, about 40 miles (Route 40) ; (6) to Gwatar, 96 miles (Routes 23 and 36) ; (7) to Bahu Kalat, 62 miles, via Talang (little used). From here to Chahbar the following routes exist:— (i) Via Tallarah and Balui Sik crossing the Kaju river at Gazeh Manzil and thence over comparatively flat country to Chahbar. This is the route followed by the Russian survey party of 1899-1900. See Route No. 45 (Grey’s). (u) Continuing down the Kaju river, via Bug to Gazeh Manzil and thence to Chahbar following the same track as in (i). This track is easier than (i), though longer, and unlimited water is available from the perennial Kaju stream. (in) Via Geh—the longest route, which is seldom used.478 QAS—-QIS The district of Qasrqand consists generally of a valley running east District. and west ’ bounded on the west by Geh, on the east by the watershed of the Mazan Kaur, on the north by the Nukach hills, and on the south by the Baga-i-Band range. It is watered by the Kaju river (g. v .), which has numerous hamlets along its banks, of which Bug appears to be the chief. Its mdlidt in 1903 was Rs. 1,900, while its Sarddr in the same year was Jan Muhammad,Khan, of the Bulidi tribe, who is said to control 500 fight ing men. The known history of Qasrqand is very scanty. No doubt at one Histor time it formed part of the territory of the lb rJ ' Khans of Kalat, but after the defeat of the Baluchis at- Chil-i-Nadir, in A.D. 1737, the Persians occupied Bashar and Amir Mahabbat was installed as Governor of Baluchistan, with his head-quarters at Qasrqand. During the anarchy, which ensued on the death of Nadir Shah, about 1742, Eastern Baluchistan resumed its inde pendence, but in 1849 the Persians seized Geh, and probably annexed Qasrqand at the same time. Since then it has formed a sub-district of Makran, under the rule of the Governor of Persian Baluchistan, resident at Fahraj or Bamphr.— (Floyer, 1876 ; Janes, 1900 \ Sykes, 1903.) QASRMUNl— A village and ndld, 4f miles from Geh on the Fanuch road, in Makran- — {Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) qibleh— A tract of country in the Geh district of Persian Makran, situated between Chahbar and the territory formed by Masqat. The term “ Qibleh 5 ’ implies the westerly position of this portion. With reference to the rest of Makran, it contains the townships of Sirgan, Kair, BIr, Karvan, Surag, etc., and on the coast the villages of Tiz, Tank, Galag, among the most flourishing. Numerous herds of camels wander over this district kept for breeding and farm purposes. The people, however, seem poor and apathetic. The Hot and Sangalu tribes prevail.— {Ross.) QIRTAl— A village in the Shamil district {q.v.). QISHM— Also pronounced Jishm and by Arabs occasionally Jazirat-at-Tawilah. The largest and most important of all the islands in the Persian Gulf it is situated on the coast of the Persian districts of Bastak- and Shamil, which it subtends from Lingeh almost to Bandar Abbas, and is divided from the mainland by the channel 1 to 8 miles in breadth known to British mariners as Clarence Strait. The islands of Barak and Hanjam may be regarded as being physically appendages of Qishm. The extreme length of Qishm from east-north-east to west-south-west is 68 miles ; its average breadth is difficult to calculate on account of the irregularity of its , outline, but may be roughly stated at 10 miles, though in one place,QASRQAND On page 478, under “ District ”, in line 9, after “ 500 fighting men ” insert The following is a genealogical tree of the rulers of Qasrqand and Geh :— Oeh and Qasrqand, Slier Khan, Nahrui of Sistan, J Saiyid Khan of Bam pur, , . i.

(Gumbley, 1913.),On page 478, in line 7, after “ * * appendages of Qislmi ” add the follow ing paragraph History,—In 1820 a concession was obtained by the British from the Sultan of Oman for the occupation of a piece of territory on Qishm Island, and an important naval and military station was established on the north east corner of the island. But this, as well as a station tried on the island of Hanjam, being found unhealthy, a move was made to Basidu, at the western end of the island. This became the headquarters of the Indian Naval Squadron, and a detachment of Indian troops was regularly maintained there until 1879, when it was removed to Jask, where it remained till 1887,* The concession for Basidu was renewed by the Persian Government when it took over Qishm Island from the Sultan of Oman.QIS-QIS 479 nearly abreast of the adjoining island of Hanjam, it actually exceeds 20. The shape of Qishm is somewhat that of a fish, the eastern end represent ing the head, the western end the tail, and Laft point a projecting dorsal fin. The coast is generally rocky : its two principal salients are Laft point and Khargu point, both about the centre of the island, the former on the northern, the latter on the southern coast. Khargu point is low and rocky, but Dairistan bay to the west of it is sandy, and there are swamps inland of it. Ras Dastakan, the south-western point of the island, is also low and rocky : Basidu point, the westernmost, is described in the -article on BasidfL Qishm is almost covered with table-topped hills of a light brown colour with broken-down sides and in some cases of very remarkable appearance ; there is, however, a general absence of dominant or characteristic peaks. The land which rises immediately behind Qishm town continues increasing in elevation till at one point, 3 miles west of the town, it reaches 560 feet ; it then falls away abruptly to a low plain which reaches across the island from sea to sea and is several miles in breadth. Beyond the plain the hills recommence but without any remarkable features until Kishkuh the . highest summit on Qishm with an elevation of 1,300 feet, is reached, at about 17 miles from Basidu and nearly in the middle of the island. About 3 miles west of Kishkuh, a range of dark-red hills with patches i of slate colour crosses the island from north to south; where it abuts upon the southern coast, with which it is in contact for 5 miles, it con tains great salt-caverns and is known by the name of Namakdan. The , largest cave is at the eastern end of Namakdan ; it is over 200 feet in height, is about as deep as it is high and has a span of 60 or 70 feet.* The general geological formation of the island is the same as that of the adjoin ing coasts. The upper strata are of course sandstone, grit and conglomerate, supported by a blue lias marl and interrupted in one place by the salt hills already described : the aspect of the whole island is that of a plateau rising by a perpendicular scarp from the sea beach and eroded by weather in many valleys, some of which are parallel to the coast. The surface of the island along the southern coast has the bleak and barren appearance usual in this part of the world in the formation to which it belongs. Qishm in fact is, apart from the villages, almost a desert, but the hills contain some wild goats, partridges and pigeons, and the plains some gazelle. The population, including Qishm town, amounts to about 13,500 souls. Nearly all are Arabs by race and Sunnis by religion ; but there are Persian communities at Qishm town and Diraku which together may number 500 souls among whom also the Sunni form of Islam prevails. The Arabs belong for the most part to tribes of Trucial ’Oman but these tribal divi sions are not here of much importance ; the Shaikh of the island belongs to a tribe called Bani Ma’in or Mu’ain who are said to be connected with Shammarof Najd and number in Qishm town about 100 persons. The population is said to have been considerably reduced by a severe earthquake which in 1898 visited Qishm and levelled many village with the ground. Arabic is the language of the island. * Tim cave, with the methods of working, and the Namakdan generally, are described by Felly in the Bombay Geographical Journal, Volume XVII, 1865. paces 39-241. * ^ 8480 QIS-QIS Salt is the only natural product of value, but most of the villages possess date-groves and some have small expanses of cultivation, these form ing the only verdant spots. Fishing, navigation and boat-building are the principal occupations, Qishm town and Laft village being centres of the last-mentioned industry ; but there fc is also some weaving of Lungis and Chddars, and some villages are given up to camel-breeding and stock- raising.

The Deputy-Governor of Bandar Abbas occasionally attempts to assert jurisdiction over the island, but his authority is not respected. The local chief through whom the general administration is carried on is the Shaikh of Qishm, who resides at Qishm town and is at present an Arab named Shaikh Hasan. The Persian central government is unrepresented save by officials of the Imperial customs at Qishm town, Laft, Dairistan and Suzeh.

The chief place and only town in Qishm island, on the easternmost ex tremity of which it is situated. The town stands on a fairly level sandy site, close to the water’s edge ; it has a small date plantation on either side and several domed water reservoirs at a short distance to southward. Behind it and to the south of it the land rises in a gradual slope from the sea till it breaks off precipitously to the north and west. Qishmis a well- built town and formerly contained several high tddglrs reaching 50 to 60 feet above sea-level, but they were destroyed by an earthquake in 1898. There is an old Portuguese fort now in a ruined condition. There are several wells in and about the town, but only one,.. which is about a mile from the fort, furnishes good water; 7 birkehs also exist for storing rain water, and these generally suffice for the needs of the population. The climate is cooler than that of Bandar Abbas. The population may amount to 3,000 souls and comprises 100 families of Persians, of whom 8 ' are ’Awazi and 2 Hindu : the remainder of the people are Arabs of the same tribes as occupy the rest of the island. The inhabitants are mostly engaged in fishing, in trade, in boat-building and in the weaving of lungls. The chief exports are dried fish, shark-fins, liingis, salt, and ghi collected from the villages of the island ; the leading imports are rice, piece-goods, planks: and beams, coffee and sugar. Some common pottery is manufactured front the clay of the island. Date palms number about 900, and the livestock486 QTS-QUO consist of a few camels, 30 donkeys, 160 cattle, and 200 steep and goats. The shipping of the port (included in thatof Qishm island, q.v.) is con siderable ; but there is no harbour, and off the town are several reefs of rock and sand. Vessels of moderate or large size must anchor a mile or more from the beach, but are fairly well sheltered from the prevailing winds. Qishm is the seat of a Shaikh who, under the Persian authorities, has executive power over the whole island. The town possesses a Madraseh in which advanced instruction in Arabic and theology is said to be given.— {Lorimer, 1908.) QUCHA— A place in the desert of Lut in southern Khorasan, met with on the first march from Deh-Saif on the road to Blrjand.

Its products are : wheat barley, Indiancorn, tobacco, cotton, rice, beans and there are a few fig and hme trees.The village consists of 150 mat huts clustering round a low hill and, at the time of my visit, in consequence of the severe drought, supplies were extremely scarce, but, I imagine, they are never plentiful. 800 sheep, 200 cattle, 40 camels and a few donkeys constitute the live stock of the district. The mdlidt paid is 50 tumdns. The krdn is the usual currency and rupees are accepted at a heavy discount. The inhabitants are, upon the whole, friendly.— (Sykes, March 1898.) RAMlSHK (Ktjtal)— A pass apparently traversing the Ramishk Kuhin Rashakard. Jennings states that this is the nearest pass over the Paspin and its south-easterly continuation to the Shikarabad Kutal, on the Rlgan-Minab road. It is said to be four stages from Kahur-i-Daraz on the Rigan-Minab road, and lies on the road from Jashk to Rigan. It is available for guns, as Persian wheeled artillery has been over it. No other pass exists east of it till the Fanuch Pass is reached.-— {Jennings.) RAMKAN— Elev. 2,950'. A halting-place in Sarhad, 41 miles east-south-east of Rigan, on the road to Bazman via Hanjareh.

The camel-grazing is excellent and fuel is plentiful, while the soil is very fair. The climate is hot. The Kuh-i-Ramkan, a curious red conical hill, which rises just above the camping-ground, is visible for some distance.— {Wood, February 1899.) RAMKAN— A dry torrent-bed in Kirman, about 500 or 600 yards wide, which crosses the track from ’Azizabad to Chah Ahmad, 53 miles south-east of the former place and about 10 miles south-east of Deh-i-Yaghi Khan. Its banks are 8 to 10 feet high.— {Moore, February 1904.) RAMKAN (River)— A torrent bed in Sarhad, which is crossed by the road from Rigan to Bazman via Hanjareh, at the 38th mile.

BlPCH (River)— A perennial river in Persian Makran which comes down by Bint in the Geh district and reaches the coast by two mouths, 9 miles apart, of which the western, Khur Rapch, is 92 miles east by south of Jashk point and the eastern and more important, Khur Galag, is 78 miles west by north ■of Chahbar. Both estuaries have shallow bars with deep water inside and on each is situated a small village having the same name as the Khur • neither place, however, is much frequented except by fishing boats! Khur Rapch is the more considerable on account of its large tidal back-water and could be used by small vessels if it were buoyed. The coast on both sides of the river is low and sandy and full of creeks and back-waters. About 12 miles from the coast the Rapch river is crossed by the land telegraph line between New Jashk and Gwadar, its width from bank to bank being at this point 612 yards. On the east bank is a telephone hut. This spot is chiefly memorable as the scene of the cruel murder by Karvan Baluchis on the 2nd December 1897 of Mr. E. Graves, Telegraph Superintendent. The country on both banks of the river from near Balak on the east to the Kashi stream on the west at a distance of from 10 to 25 miles from the sea is known as Karvan; it is, for this country, well-wooded and cultivated and abounds in small game, such as black partridge, and, in the season, duck: it contains a number of vil lages. The Rapch in flood inundates the country on both sides of it. The usual ford is at the telegraph crossing, but abetter one exists lil miles further down, while the last ford of all to become impassable is 3 miles further up.— {Larimer, 1906 ; Austin, 1910.)

RAVlRl— A district of Kirman to the north-west of Khabis.— RAYIN-Lat. 28° 35' 30'; Elev. 7,100'; 6,616'.-(^). A large, well-built, thriving village in Kirman, about 60 miles south east of Kerman city. The houses are not crowded together, but eachstands on about a quarter of an acre of well kept, fertile garden, surround ed by high mud walls. The streets are cleaner than is usually the case in Persian villages, from the fact that numerous rivulets, constructed for irrigating the gardens, run rapidly down them. The village is on a slope, so that these rivulets, which are on the surface about the middle of the village are, at the upper end, 16 feet under ground and only acces sible by kahns. The arrangement of the gardens is generally the same. A row of tall, slender poplar trees runs round the gardens inside the mud wall. Between these are a few willow bushes and an occasional rose. The garden is usually full of lucerne, grown in oblong beds. This is at fre quent intervals cut down to about an inch from the ground, but the roots soon send out a new crop. There is a small and busy bazar, where, in addition to the ordinary supplies sold, knives, felts, hats, shoes, and glass bottles are made. There are several fine walled-in gardens well stocked with fruits and willow trees, and a large graveyard filled with marble- covered tombs, for Rayln is famous for its yellow marble. The population numbers 5,000 and includes three sects, viz., Gumbai, Razai and Ismali, and four fire-worshippers. The people own 2,200 sheep and goats, 200 camels, and some 30 donkeys. There are 3 hammams (or baths), 6 merchants, 8 shoe-makers, 4 mechanics, 6 carpenters, 4 felt- workers, 7 glass-workers. Mdlidt, 4,000 tumdns : some 2,000 mans of opium are cultivated annually. Up to the last fifty years the people all lived in an enormous fort, the remains of which, in a fair state of preservation, still crown the top of the hill. The fort is said to have contained 3,000 families, and the houses of the governor and the great men were very large and neatly plastered. The woodwork, however, has now been removed, and the roofs in most cases have fallen in. Coming from the south Rayln is the first true Persian town one reaches where the women dress in white, a colour peculiar to Kirman, white being reserved for Jewesses in Yazd, and dark blue being the rule for Muham madans. The town, lying, as it does, at the junction of many roads, has been of importance for generations, and was the site of a battle between Malik Arslan and his half-brother, Bahram Shah of the Seljuk dynasty, in the twelvth century. There are some 220 families of nomads in the district, for particulars of which see Kirman. RAYlN—L at. 27° 3' 6'; Long. 57° 10' 45'; Elev. 378'.

There are 25 huts and about 100 inhabitants; they own 150 oxen, 600 sheep and goats, 30 donkeys and 10 camels. There are also two wells with perennial water, 20 feet deep and some rain cultivation. The plain in which this village lies has a bad reputation for robberies. Jennings gives an account of one which happened shortly before his arrival. The bandits were said to be Bashakardis, and the Persian Government seemed quite unable to cope with them.— (Jennings.)rezbanigOn— A small village of 70 houses in Riidkan and 13 miles south of Gulashkard.

RlGAN- Lat. 28° 39' SO'; Long. 59° 2' 0'; Elev. 2,288'. 1,576'—(Grey). 2,300' {St. John). A village in the Narmashir district of Kirman, 53miles south-east of Bam, on the road to Bampur. It was formerly a place of some import ance, but now consists of little more than the fort and a mass of ruins. The fort has a square trace, each side being 150 yards in length. There are seven round turrets, and one rectangular one, for flank defence. It has never been completed, and there are no terrepleins nor stages, nor are there any houses (except two of modern construction) within the walls. The garrison consisted in 1898 of 10 soldiers. To the east of the present fort are the ruins of an ancient one, which is said to have been occupied up to 1870. When Newcomen visited Rigan in February 1905 it contained barely 200 people, while Grey, who passed through in September of the same year, found only 30 houses inhabited. All round, however, are hamlets from which supplies can be procured in abundance, the chief products being wheat, barley, Indian-corn, rice, millet, henna, beans of various sorts, sesame, indigo and lentils, also some opium. Cotton was formerly largely496 BIG—RIG produced, but little is now grown. A kind of grass called sarut, from which chiqs and chairs are made, is found in abundance, while the grazing for camels is considered to be the best in Persia. Water is obtained from kdrizes which are numerous, and much of the cultivated land is ‘ mudf ’ or revenue-free. Game is fairly plentiful in the district, chinkara, wild asses, pig, wolves, jackals and foxes, besides sandgrouse, partridges, pigeon and chikor, having been met with by Jennings in 1885. Three routes lead from Bampur to Rigan, viz :— (i) The one traversed by Pottinger, some 170 miles in length, which possesses no advantages. (ii) That traversed by Sir Frederick Goldsmid, 186 miles in length. (iii) That taken by Jennings, which is according to him the best, as it is available for guns, which have already been taken along it, but to render it really serviceable some unskilled labour would be necessary in a few places. This route runs via Gazzaq, Dar-i-Kishkin, Dar-i-Ahu, Gehgan and Chah-i- Malik. There are also roads from Rigan to Bandar Abbas, to Nur Muhammad Kariz (in Sarhad), to Sistan, and to Bam. There is also said to be a route to Jashk, available for laden animals but not for guns, 10 long stages.— [Jennings, 1885 ; Sykes, 1902 ; Newcomen, 1905 ; Grey, 1905.)

A halting-place in Kirman, about 100 miles from Minab, on the road to Rigan. It consists of 3 wells, 18 ft. deep, situated under the right bank of the Halil Rud. The water stinks, but is not very salt. Theinhabitants are of the Samboi tribe. There are marks of cultivation in the neighbourhood, where considerable crops are raised when there is sufficient water in the river to irrigate them. Jowari, wheat and barley are grown. The ground is sandy. There is an abundance of tamarisk jungle. Camel-grazing and fuel are plentiful.— (Grey, September 1905.) HIGMATI— A grazing district in the Marz sub-division of Bashakard, on the south ern border of the Jaz Murian Hdmun.

At the time of Mir Chahkar’s departure (see Baluchis) these people lived on the sandy desert east and north of Jalk and they were called as above, the name being derived from “ Rek, ” a corruption of “ Rig,” meaning “ sand ” in Persian. They were (1885 A.D.) for the most part to be found on the banks of | the Helmand, in Narmashir, Sarhad, Mashkid, Kharan, Jalk and around Bampur; the majority live in British territory. They are divided into three main divisions :— 1. Nathuzai, living in Mashkil, with headquarters at Ladgasht (British Baluchistan) a branch of this division, named Bulanzai, settled in MirjawS about a century ago, and are shown as Daniams (q.v.) as they are Persian subjects. 2. Ganguzai, a very small division, numbering about 100 men, part of whom are now practically Damanis and part are in the service of the chief of Kharan. 3. Husainbar, a small division, who settled in Jalk about 80 years ago. They own a small fort called Chagiid there. They muster 40 fighting men with 20 rifles. The principal Sardar is Muhammad Riza Khan of Mirjawa.— (Jennings, 1885 ; Hogg, 1909.) RlK MALIK (KirmIn)— A stage on the desert route from Jalk to Ladls.

SADAICH— A village in the Jashk district [q-v.). SADAICH (River)— A considerable stream in Persian Baluchistan. It rises north of the Band-i-Mlag range, which it passes by the Shimsan gorge, a defile we may suppose to resemble the Fanuch Pass. It is possible that the Sadaich carries off some portion of the drainage of Shahrl and Rudbar, but equally probable that it rises in the Band-i-Marz or its easterly continuation, the hills south-west of Bampur. After what we may suppose to be a general southerly course through a hilly country for some 25 or 30 miles from the Shimsan gorge, it bends westwards, or south-westwards, passing the eastern end of the Gau Kuh range* and winding in that direction for another 20 miles or so, it turns south and passing through the coast range between the Surag and Huni hills, falls into the sea 30 or 40 miles west of the Rapch, and about 20 miles east of the Gabrig. The Sadaich is the western boundary of Makran which, as elsewhere explained, is a mere geographical express! n, the country so' called being partly in Persian, and partly in Kalat territory. In the mterior it divides Ranhshk and B nt from the Gaur and Parman districts of Bashakard. On the coast, the Makran district of Qibleh, or the Dasht, lies to the east of the Sadaich, and the Gabrig district to the west. * Or, perhaj^s, the Tlai range [q.v.) mentioned by Floyer. We know next to nothing of the topography of the country 3 S. 2508 SAD-SAD Not far from the Sadaich, west of the point where the river emerges from the hills, is a pile of stones, or pillar (chadar), said to have been raised by an independent prince or malik of Makran to mark the limit of bis territory. Itjs known as Maliki Chadar or Chidag or, as marked on the telegraph route map, Malikani Chedag. Nasir Khan I of Kalat is said to have extended his sway to this point. A camel road from Jashk and the coast districts immediately to its east, leads up the Sadaich, either to Bint or up through the Shimsan gorge to Ramishk and the districts west of Bampiir.* The former was travelled ; by Floyer in 1876 : the latter is said to be a good road, that is, it is ; practicable for laden camels.f According to Floyer’s account of his journey from Bint, the Sadaich is first struck at the junction of the Surini Kaur (q.v.), 30 miles from the kdfileh halting-place on the Pasga (q.v.), and 23 miles after leaving the Gidich, the intervening country being a barren shingly plain. The Sadaich is here a fine stream, much larger than in its lower course through the flat sandy country on the coast. Its bed is about a mile and a half I wide, cut 100 feet deep into the stony plain. There are high hills as well as spurs on either side, but they appear as a rule to stand some distance back. The stream is broad but not deep, and runs pretty regularly from side to side, leaving low flats (kaches or bents). Every kach is well treed and grassy, and would make a good camping-ground for any party carrying their -own provisions. They are all distinguished by names of their own. The kach near the junction of the Surini ndla is an admirable placeJ; water, camel fodder and firewood being abundant and excellent. It is one of the regular halting-places for kdfilehs taking the Sadaich route into the interior. The route leads down the valley, occasionally leaving it by a steep ascent up the cliff on one side or the other, to avoid a larger bend than usual. “ Sometimes a mile through tall rich vegetation, sometimes over rough large shingle, thickly studded with feathery tamarisk, and sometimes down the broad, shallow river itself.” Where the road quits the valley it lies over stony plain until it again descends the cliffs to the stream. Floyer appears to have followed the winding course of the river for some 25 miles; he does not give the distance. He left it about where it makes | * Thence probably direct to Bam ; also to Kirman through Jiruft. f There can be no reasonable doubt that the Sirich of Haj i Abdul Nab! is the Sadaich . The Haji was at Bint in April 1839 having come from Ramishk. He relates that going from thence he returned towards Mutarabad (q.v.) until he came on the Kaur-i-Sirich, where he spent the night. He travelled in this kaur for three stages, sometimes due South, at others south-south-west, over a very difficult river-bed, winding between hills. On the fifth day he arrived at the port of Sirich, a few huts of poor fishermen. From thence he went west to Gabrig. The only puzzling thing about this is, that while Mutarabad appears to be only 10 to 14 miles north-west of B nt, the Shimsan gorge must be merely 40 miles west of the same place. However it is possible that the Haji made two stages before he struck the “ Sirich ” instead of one, as implied above. % it may safely be surmi-ei that vi.is spot would be known to any inhabitant of the country as Surini Daf. Here the Biut road, quitting the river eastwards, must divide from that to the interior, vid the Shimshan defile, which continues up stream,SAD—SAF 509 its southerly turn for the coast hills, ascending a steep defile on the right bank. “ From the top of this was a grand view of the broad blue river, winding through a grassy, well-wooded bottom, hemmed in on both sides by fine hills.” The Jcd/Ueh route continues down the river, and would probably strike the telegraph road in the plain at 16 to 20 miles. That followed by Floyer was a short cut across the hills towards the Gabrig river. He reached the plains under the Huni hills, 52 miles from Jashk, after about 20 miles of very rough travelling without a guide. After emerging from the hills, the Sadaich, like the other rivers which cross the plain to the sea, cuts a constantly changing route through the sand strip. Where crossed by the telegraph road, its bed is only about 400 yards wide, and the running stream is considerably less than up among the hills, as so much of the water is absorbed by the soft, sandy soil. What remains is thick and muddy, very different from the clear delicious fluid in the upper course of the river. The actual bed is rich silt, which might be made to bear heavy crops. Crossing is often difficult owing to the muddy nature of the bottom. After a°storm the river is often a raging muddy torrent, 200 yards across, and impassable for several days.— {Floyer.) The halting-place on tha Sadaich is 11 stages, about 145| miles from Chahbar, and 14 stages (63| miles) from Jashk. Water is abundant from the river; there is also a well at Gilik {q.v.), 6 or 7 miles east. Firewood and camel-grazing are abundant. The country in the neighbourhood is all flat, sandy plain.— {Pierce.)

It thence con tinues in a north-westerly direction to the Gill Kuh and running parallel to the Sianeh Kuh, which range it probably joins eventually. Haji ’Abdul Nabi, who was at Nahu in 1838, says the people of that place believed gold and silver to exist in the Safid Kuh. On the same hills, they told him, was found in spring a bush, which at night from a distance appeared on fire, but on approaching it the delusion vanished. .

Goldsmid calls it Shai or Syud Harun, but “ Shai ” is per* haps a misprint for “ Shah.” He saw “ a tree which, though a tamarisk, looked almost Druidical and quite picturesque.” But the shrine is said to be a well. “ No Baluch ever passes this place without laying there his offering : nor would he think of reclaiming any money or property acci dentally dropped. If a traveller, halting for the night, burns the wood and gives his cattle the fodder procurable on the spot, it is well; but if he should take the wood to burn elsewhere it would be impossible to light it; or if he should cut and carry away the grass for consumption elsewhere, it would kill the animals it was intended to nourish.” SAKANSURIAN— Elev. 3,200'.

SARBAZ— Elev. 3,184'. A village and district in Makran, situated on the Sarbaz river 68 miles south-east of Fehruj, on the road to Gwadar. The village consists now of a mass of ruins, testifying to the former im portance of the place, and is built in a small valley about one mile long by half a mile broad. The old fort, though a good deal battered about, is still very strong and stands on a shaly hill some 50 feet in height, though it is commanded by other hills within 200 yards on the southern side. It was partially destroyed by the Persians about 1830, and has not been repaired since. It is the occasional place of residence of the chief of the district. Sarbaz has very few inhabitants, as they have mostly moved away further south to escape from Persian exactions ; and whenever any of the officials appear in the neighbourhood, the small remainder take to the hills. But for this it might be very prosperous. There are 75 house holds in the village. About 50 Indian maunds of wheat and barley, 260 maunds of rice and 15 maunds of beans are grown in terraces along the valley, and dates are plentiful from groves in the neighbourhood. Fuel and grazing are scarce, but water from the river is good and fairly abundant. The district proper appears to consist of the area bounded on the north District by the Zard Kuh range, which forms the watershed of the Sarbaz and Bampur drainage ;518 SAR—SAR on the west by the watershed of the Kajfi drainage ; on the east by Irafshan ; and on the south by a line running throught Parud. Though hilly, it is well watered by many mountain streams, and con tains numerous small villages and a considerable amount of cultivation. The Sarbaz river which runs throughout its length has a broad gravelly bed, but the stream in ordinary times only occupies a minor part of it. Date-groves are plentiful everywhere, and fuel is usually procurable. The inhabitants are Baluchis, belonging to the Bar, Rais, AskanI, Arbab and other tribes, many of whom go to Karachi and East Africa for work, so that Urdu, as well as Persian and Baluchi, is generally understood in the district The chief is a man of considerable authority. He has under him the district of Qasrqand as well as Sarbaz, and is said to be able to raise some 1,200 good fighting men. The maliat of the district is Rs. 5,000, paid to the Governor of Bampur. Sarbaz village lies at the junction of several hdfileh routes, of which the principal are those leading to Bampur, Magas, and Gwadar, for particu lars of which vide Route Book.

SARBAZ RIVER or BAKU RIVER— A. river in Makran, one of the most important streams in that country. Hnses about 22 miles north of Sarbaz village {see above) at the eastern end ol the Zard Kuh range which runs from south of the Humand peak 50 miles in a west-south-west direction and overlooks the Bampur plain. ihe range terminates about the Ahuran peak. From thence the Sar baz runs at first south and then about south-east through a hilly coun try of close parallel ranges for about 55 miles, till it emerges in the Pishin IhlT innnr average width of 30 to 40 miles), dropping from near VthTn ^ ^ ^ S ° UrCe t0 60 ° ^ “ the nei g hb °urhood of Bugani, Crossing the valley diagonally, in a south-east direction, it turns south- A nd / rUn f ^ low roc ky hills to the alluvial plains of Bahu-Dashtian {q. v .) which commence a few miles north of Balm Kalafi Lt 18 hQIQ known as the Bahu river. Not far south of Baku Kalat theriver is divided into three principal and many subordinate channels, known as Slsdd, or the hundred threads. Further south these are intercept ed by the Kaju or Dashtlari {q.v.), and thence the united river appears to be called the Dashtian as often as the Bahu. Finally it falls into the sea by one or two closely contiguous mouths at Gwadar. The range in which the Sarbaz originates is the watershed and poli tical boundary between Bampur and Sarbaz. Two main watercourses descending from it southwards by Kulani and Ispatki unite at 6 miles from Sarbaz and form the river. By each of these is a route from Sarbaz to Bampur. The eastern, or Kulanl, watercourse appears to be the most important, and immediately on the further side of the watershed be tween it and the Humand peak are torrent-beds which unite to form one of the principal sources of the Bampur river. The pass over the hill, be tween the ravines draining in opposite directions is known simply as “ Gudar,” a word nearly equivalent to the familiar “ kutal.” It is the easiest access to the Bampur valley from the south-east. Near the bottom of the descent on the Bampur side is the halting-place of Pa Gudar, or “ foot of the pass,” a name which St. John has applied apparently by an oversight to the pass itself. Starting from its western source, the river-bed narrows and widens, following the formation of the hills, and is sandy and pebbly. When descended in February 1871, there was a quantity of water, owing to recent rain, but at intervals large deep pools under the rocks make it probable that water is obtainable all the year round. Tamarisk trees and constant ■'pish cover the banks, the hills on either side varying in height. The regular halting place of KulauT is on the right of the stream, 15J miles from the watershed. At about 13 miles below this pi ce the Ispatki watercourse and road come in from north west by north. Thence the river-bed becomes very broad and stony, increasing in width up to Sarbaz (19 miles), where it forms a sort of amphi theatre, surrounded by rocks and fringed with palm trees. The stream here is continuous, but small in proportion to the size of its bed. The Girmak, a large affluent, rising in the Shakin range, here joins it from the east. Below Sarbaz the hills on either side of the river change character, and enormous masses of irregularly-shaped black rock border both sides of the river-bed, here fringed with groves of date palm, mango and orange trees. The constant turnings and windings of the narrow valley, or defile, of the river create a succession of very picturesque bays, in which the black rocks at the side, the date palms,-fresh green cultivation and the running water, form a pleasant and harmonious contrast. The cultiva tion, prolonged without intermission to Dipkur (14 miles), is on raised artificial platforms on the riverbanks, irrigated by arlificial channels. The mango, orange tree, and mulberry abound and flourish. Beans and barley appear to be the main crops, and at the end of February are nearly ripe for the sickle. There is a continuous succession of small villages, the inhabitants of which are almost entirely engaged in cultivation. The river-bed is very stony and trying for horses as the water collects in deep pools. The bed opens out about a mile before reaching Dipkur {q.v.).520 SAR-SAR situated in much the same kind of amphitheatre as Sarbaz, and possess ing a ruined mud fort, and the usual number of mud huts. A water course, called the Kash, joins here from the west. Thence to Parud (12 miles) the river presents little change, but its bed widens and becomes much more stony, with less water. The hills on either side (mostly conglo merate ridges) are not so high, and their bases slope in a way to form a valley, in the centre of which winds the river-bed. The country in gen eral, too, is much more open. The road shifts from one side of the river to the other, winding through patches of cultivation and groves of date palm. About five or six villages dot the banks. Parud (q.v.) is a strange-lookim* place, consisting of the usual ruined mud fort and some eighty mud huts° with a poor population, and situated on a high bluff bank, left of the river’ which seems here to terminate, as it makes a detour at right angles to the left, and the two banks merge as it were in one, to the eye of the downward passenger. It is probably from this appearance that the village receives its name* A broad stony watercourse from the west joins the Sarbaz at the angle above mentioned. The road winding up through the village from the river-bed leads on to a stony and spacious plain beyond, descending again into the date-groves and cultivation on the left bank of the river, crossing it at about 2 miles, and following the windings of the bed on the right side for some 9 miles, when the path leaves the river-bed and turns off abruptly to the right (west) through a narrow gorge in the hills on the bank. In less than 2 miles the gorge opens; and here the road forks, one branch leading to the village of Firuzabad plainly visible ahead on the right bank of the river, the other winding among hills and groves up to Rask. About 5 miles from Parud an old ruined square tower is to be observed on the left bank. Firuzabad is a picturesque place on a high site, overlooking acres of cultivation surrounded by date palms and very luxurious mango and orange trees. Rask {q.v.) has about 160 huts and is similar to all the other Sarbaz villages. About 4 miles below Rask the river emerges into the plain which extends eastwards between parallel ranges of hills to beyond Qasrqand and west for a very great distance. At Baftan {q.v.), 5 miles from Rask, the fearbaz is joined by a considerable affluent coming eastwards from the Qasr qand watershed.. Passing Baftan, with its dense grove of date trees, 5 miles from R^sk, the river bends south-east, and runs apparently in a deep stony bed. On the right bank is a thick low jungle of tamarisk and caper. On the other side are stony and rather bare plains. At 15 miles from Rask it !S joined by the watercourse from Murtan, opposite to the camping-place o ugani (q.v.).^ Thence it continues through jungle for some miles in the same direction when it turns southward entering the low hills south of P^shin. . In these hills it receives the watercourse which carries off the Pishin dramage. From about here it begins to be called the Bahu, and with a winding course has a general south-south-west direction. Its bed is cut deep through day and conglomerate strata. At the point where it was left by St. John and Blanford in January 1872, some 20 miles south of Bugani, it is con fined by cliffs 60 to 80 feet high. There are fine tamarisks in the bed at * Pa-Ri-Rud, the foot of the stream.SAR-SAR 521 , ns point. A short distance to the south, it passes through a pretty gorge between the Pitag Kuh to the west, and the spurs of Jambkl to the east, thence emerging on to the alluvial plain of Bahu-Dashtiari. The left (east) bank is, however, broken by ravines and low spurs from the Jambki ranges. There appears to be a good deal of low jungle here, in and about toe river-bed, which rather increases lower down. From the gorne the road on the right (west) bank cuts across a bend, and at about 10 miles reaches Bahu Kalat (q.v.) which is on the east bank. The crossing here is not always easy. In January 1872 the river was 60 to 80 yards wide aim about 3 feet deep, with a slow current and muddy water, presenting a great contrast to its clear and rapid stream in tlie hills. The actual banks are here low only 10 feet or so above the water, and are evidently over flowed m high floods. The bottom is treacherous in places, and crossing on horseback unsafe without a guide. • On the side opposite the villages are many extensive clearings which are flooded for irrigation purnoses the water being retained on them by embankments. . Fro f 1 Bahr ; a thick belt of jungle extends down the course of the river, low rocky hills on the east and a wide flat plain extending to the hori zon on the west. At 8 miles or so below Bahu Kalat it enters the Sisad divi sion of the Bar u-Dasntiari districts, and here, as above stated, splits into three mam channels and a great number of smaller ones. The countrv here used to be. well irrigated and fertile but owing to the river having changed its course m recent years, much of the land has now been thrown out of cultivation and ruined (see Sisad). .Not far to the souih and west, the Sisad streams are joined by, and inter mingle with, those of the Dashtiari, or Kaju, river (q.v.) and the whole bend away south-east. However, the main branch of the Bahu, called the Jadai and the main branch, of the Dashtiari, though running nearly parallel to each other for a considerable distance, do not appear to unite till a point is reached fully 40 miles from Sis id, and only 10 or 11 from the sea. This place is known as Gazak. Both channels a.e often dry or nearly so the perennial stream being drawn off above for cultivation. A little water however, runs for some months after rain. The beds of the Jadai and the Dashtiari are surprisingly small, considering the real importance of tlv se rivers. Where crossed by the telegraph line and road about 3 miles above Gazak, they are only 70 and 30 yards wide. But when in flood they may be impassable for a considerable time. This is due apparently as much or more to the softness of the bottom as to depth and strength of the cur rent. Floods occur only in the cold weather. At these times, curiously enough, the river may often be forded at Gazak several days before it is practicable under the o telegraph line. Finally, the united river falls into Gwatar Bay close to the village of that name, and some 8 miles west of the western debouchure of the Dasht river St. John says “ by one or two closely-contiguous mouths.” One only is marked on all the maps. It is possible, however, there may be a second channel filled only in floods. The lower courses of all rivers on the Makran coast shift and change frequently owing to the soft sandy nature of the soil which, has to be traversed immediately before reaching the sea Many of the rivers have more than one channel of exit. 61 I, B, 3U/ 622 SAR—SAR At Gwatar, and the river mouths in the bay, boats are procurable for crossing the Jadai and Dashtiarl when otherwise impassable. The influence of the tide appears to extend at least as far up as Gazak, and the water is salt to that point, but is drinkable where the telegraph crosses, for four months after rain. The river does not appear to be in any way navigable, even by small boats and for a short distance. Only in floods are boats used, for ferrying across goods and passengers.'— (Goldsmid, 1871 ; Lovett, 1871 ; Euan- Smith; St. John, 1871; Pierce; Janes-, 1900.)

On the south the plateau borders on the Garmsir or hot country, terminating at Sarblzan in a high pass of 9,200 feet, from which there is a most abrupt descent to the plain of Jiruft. The climate in summer is delightful, and the district is, for Persia, well- watered and well-wooded, abounding in pleasant orchards, while turf is actually found in many places. The capital is Dar-i-Mazar {q.v.) which possesses a shrine, dedicated to Sultan Saiyid Ahmad Saghir, and well endowed with land, the cultivators of which constitute almost the only per manent population of the district. In some places there are the ruins of villages inhabited many years ago by the Gil tribe, but these have almost disappeared, and nowadays Sarduieh is practically only inhabited during the summer months by nomads, who migrate to Jiruft for the winter. (Eor list of nomad tribes, see Kirman.) The revenue of the district was 9,000 tumdns in 1903. The Sarduieh river rises in the hills to the south-west of the plateau, and flows past Pabaneh, where it is a fine stream with a breadth of 30 yards towards Bam.— {Sykes, 1902.)

It was often raided and plun dered by Sistanis and Afghans, who used to cross the Jabal Bariz via, Deh Bakri kutal and swoop down on the place. It was sacked and destroyed by Path ’ Ali Khan about 60 years ago, since which it has not been re-built. The descendants of the former inhabitants now live in huts on the river- bank, and the elders still relate legends of the former greatness and wealth of these cities of Jiruft.

The numerous streams and watercourses running down from the central heights of Kuh-i-Taftan either waste themselves in the Lut to the north, in the Chah G-abi Hdmun in the centre, or in the Mashkil or Talab rivers in the south and east, both of which are lost eventually in the Mashkil Eamun, none of the waters ever reaching the sea. The principal villages are Yasht (the capital), . Sangun, Tamin, Kusha, Nazil, Deli Pamil, Deh Bala, Gazu and Buzdab, but none of them are of much importance, and consist chiefly of perhaps a dilapidated fort and a small nomad encampment. The inhabitants of Sarhad consist almost entirely of nomad tribes, who . . gain their living by periodical raids upon their Ethnography. . neighbours, by tending their flocks and oul- tivating barely sufficient to supply their own wants. There is a great diversity of opinion as to the total population of the district, the estimated numbers varying from 6,000 to 40,000 souls ; but it is probable that about 30,000 is the correct figure, including some 3,000 fighting men. The most important tribes are as follows :— Families. Daman or Yarahmadzai ... . . .. 1,000 Isma'ilzai ... ... .. .. 800 Rikis ... 4 . ... ... 600 Kurds ... .. ... .:. 20 Independent non-Baluch ... ... .. Unknown. The above tribes are again sub-divided into numerous clans and sub sections, almost every two or three families having its own generic name. The Yarahmadzai, as a matter of fact, is in itself one of the smallest of the lot, only aggregating some 50 families, but owing to their raiding propen sities under the notorious Jiand Khan, a legendary reputation has been esta blished, so that they control now about 1,000 families. Jiand Khan and his lieutenant, Murad Khan, have for long been the scourge of the country side and were quite uncontrolled by the Persian authorities till 1902 when, owing to their raids, which they had even carried into British territory, becoming intolerable, a combined Persian and British force, with Major Showers as Political Officer, marched to Vasht and made a satisfactory settlement with them, on the terms that they should pay a fine of Rs, 17,000, that the forts of Gazfi Deh Bala and Kamalabad should be des troyed and security taken from them for their good behaviour. Besides this, Persian troops were garrisoned at Yasht and Mirjawa, so that it is unlikely that they will renew their raiding into British territory for some time to come ; though too much must not be expected from a people who have been robbers for centuries. The Rikis, divided into 26 sub-sections, reside both in Persian and British Baluchistan ; the former consist of about 600 families, the latter of 400, who are located generally in the Dehgvar country. The Kurds, who formerly were the leading tribe in Sarhad, observed a strict neutrality when the Governor of Baluchistan, ’Abdul Path Khan, was carrying on a campaign against the Yarahmadzai in 1888. This cam paign proving successful for the Persians, they sent excuses to ’Abdul Path526 SAR—SAK Khan, giving as their reason for not assisting him, that they had been coerced by the Yarahmadzais and had stood aloof from fear of subsequent reprisals. These excuses were apparently accepted, and they were offered lands at Fehruj in exchange for their Sarhad property. This was agreed to and in 1889 the whole tribe moved down to Fehruj. Treated at first with distinction, they were all subsequently seized with their women and property and massacred almost to a man. At the present day there are not more than 20 Kurd families residing in Sarhad. . An these tribes, though nominally Sunni Muhummadans, are very lax in their religious duties, while Jennings remarks that all the months he was there he never saw a man say his prayers. Though professing a hatred for Shi’ahs they are in no wise fanatical, and they regard Christians with no dislike. Those residing in the neighbourhood of the Kuh-i-Taftan seem to look upon that volcano as their god—a survival probably, of the old fire-worshipping days. Sarhad has the best climate in Persian Baluchistan. Though cold in Climate. winter, it is temperate in summer, and with an .. . elevation of 4,500 feet at Vasht it would be excellently suited for the location of British troops ; while within 30 miles; of Vasht on the slopes of Kuh-i-Taftan, exist many places which would torm ideal hill depots, except that there is an entire lack of supplies.

The best route for a large force, but at the same time the longest, is from Bandar Abbas via Minab and Rigan, as supplies and water are more plentiful on the way. From Bampur to Vasht it is possible, with a little difficulty, to take wheeled traffic. From the east, a practicable road runs from Ladgasht to Ladis and others from Amir Chah and Saindak, on the Nushki-Sistan route, to Ladis via Mirjawa. From the north a track connects Kuh-i-Malik Siah with Ladis and Vasht via Duzdab. On all these roads, supplies are hard ly procurable, and water is bad and scanty. Sarhad, as an integral part of Persian Baluchistan, is under the Governor- General of Kirman, who rules it through the Deputy Governor at Bampur, whose representa tive is stationed at Vasht. Certain taxes and revenue are nominally levied, but little of what is collected finds its way into the Persian Exchequer, as it is almost all spent on local administration and subsides. In 1903, 800 tumdns (chiefly in kind) was said to have been raised. The authority of the Persians, however, over the district is very shadowy, and each tribe is practically independent, while, with the exception perhaps of Jiand Khan, there is no Sardar (in 1905) who has any real influence or power among the various congeries of tribes. In 1902 the Persian Government were induced to occupy Vasht and Mirjawa with troops, in order to put a stop to the incessant raids of the Damanis, but it is not yet known what permanent effect this will have on the country. The fighting strength of the Sarhad tribes has been estimated at 3,000 men, but they are very badly armed, and there are few, if any, breech-loading rifles in the district. Their power of combination too is small, as they are so constantly at feud with each other that they have no idea of unity of action. Even should they combine for a common cause, they could easily be starved into submission, by cutting off the importation of grain from Sistan ; for the country produces hardly any corn itself, and is dependent almost entirely on outside sources for its food. Strategically, however, Sarhad is of importance, as its occupation by British troops would effectually threaten any hostile advance from the north on to the Persian Gulf; and a direct line of communication from the coast to—say—Vasht, either from Chahbar or Bandar Abbas, would not be a matter of great difficulty. The inhabitants of Persian Baluchistan are well disposed towards Great Britain, and such a line of communication might therefore be considered to pass through friendly territory the whole way. As said before the climate of Sarhad is an excellent one, and the soil is capable of great fertility, and the water-supply abundant.— {Jennings, 1885 ; Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, 1898 ; Showers, 1902 ; Sykes, 1903.)

Sar ’” meaning “ head ” or “ source,” and “ nai,” a “ reed. ” Here is a dense jungle of reeds from which pipe (kalian) stems are made and large quantities are exported from here. A plentiful stream of sweet peren nial water exists, in which are abundance of small fish. In this valley are three so-called villages, but really, as before remarked, nearly ail the inhabitants live in ghiddns. .The names of the Sarnai villages are Deh Musa, Rais, Malik • each with one are more kdrlzes. The inhabitants number about 500 souls, and they own 900 sheep and goats, 250 oxen, 60 camels, and 100 donkeys. ^ Half of Sarnai is in the Bashakard district, half in the Minab, i.e. as far as the collection of revenue is concerned. The Bashakard district is now a sub-district of Rudbar. (See article on Rudbar.) Minab is under Pars.— (Jennings.) SAR PUZEH— A place in Hormuz Island (g.v.). SART AB—Elev. 1,522'. A stage on the Geh-Maluran-Fanuch and Bint-Eanuch routes, 47 miles west of Geh. The halting-place is in a ndld close to the Fanuch river-bed. There is no village near. Fuel and camel-grazing plentiful. Two deep pools of suspicious-looking water close by, under the cliffs surrounded by a large clump of old tamarisk and other trees, form the only available water-supply between here and Bint (15 miles south) at this drv season.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) * SARTAB— A 3 Sm ?T 1 r Village in Makran ’ 23 miles south-east of Geh, on the Baku Kalat road. .

These streams run into the Churak river.—(/awes, 1990.)534 SAR—SAR SARTAPl KAUR— A watercourse in Persian Balflchistan on Floyer’s tofite from KSsh! to Bint. It is struck at 19 miles from Pugunzi halting-place on the Karvan stream, and about 8 miles after leaving the Tank (q.v.). The bed of the watercourse is here about 100 yards wide and it is therefore not nearly so large as the Tank and many others, but there is water in pools, driftwood for fuel (rather scarce), and camel-grazing. It consequently makes a Con venient halting-place. On either side of the Sartapi are low shurs, hack ed by hills 800 feet high. The road ascends the Sartapi for about 2 miles, and then ascends the left bank to a high stony plateau, reaching the Gridich river at 14 miles. The Sartapi appears to run first east and then south joining the Tank. At all events it is part of the system of the Rapch river. The name is said to be derived from “ Sard ab,” “ cold Water.”— (Floyer.) SARUNADI— A halting-place on the banks of a stream in the South-West of Persia, Baluchistan.

A small village in Kirman, situated on the open plain, 931 miles south east from Eirman on the Kirman- Bam-Bampur road. It bears the re putation of being one of the most desolate and wind-stricken places in all Persia. The village, which was formerly of greater importance than now, is surrounded by a considerable amount of cultivated ground, which is well- watered, but now presents a neglected appearance. It contains one dilapidated caravanserai with a collection of low, thick walled huts built in the form of a small square as a protection from the severe storm-winds which sweep the place. On the low ground below the serai are several large, walled-in, well-stocked gardens = and orchards, and behind the largest is another collection of houses arranged in a similar square. A large irrigation channel runs along' the centre here, along which fine bid and sanged trees flourish. There is small ancient masjid in a cemetery on the high ground to the east above the gardens, with four old Willow trees hard by. Inside the shrine are old offerings, candlesticks, etc., like those seen at Ziarat-i-Shewib. In A.H. 1106, or 1694 of-our era, Faqir Shah Muhammad Ulla, returning from a pilgrimage to India by way of Jalk and Dizak, collected subscriptions and built this shrine. He subsequently went to Mahun and died there ; he is reported to have been an enterprising and respected Hajl. Under a rocky ledge in a willow grove below the cultivated ground is an old mill. There are no supplies obtainable here. Fuel is scant; good water abundant; camel-grazing over the plain and along the skirts of the hills. An office of the Persian Tele graph Line is here.—{Brazier-Creagh ;J894 ; Newcomen, 190$.), SARVISTAH— A tract of cultivatien .itt the- Shamil district 1 (?.!&gt;.);BAR—-SEH 535 SARZEH (Rjver)— A salt-water stream in the'Shamil district which rises in the hills abont 50 miles to the north of the port of that name, and after a generally south easterly course empties itself into the mangrove swamp which lies to the east of Bandar Abbas.— {Galindo, 188&amp;*) SASH0— A village in Persian Baluchistan, two days journey south-west of Bampur .—(Hdji 'Abdul Nabi.)

Low shale hills, not more than 50 feet higher than the kutal, appear on all sides. The second kutal is about 6 J miles further along the same road. It is easy, and a few hours’ work would make it practicable for guns. There are several flocks in the hills round about. From mile 10 ^ from Chamagh the road leads through the Shamadar gorge via Gumbaz-i-Shah and the Shilag to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan on the Hel- mand.— {Jennings.) SHAMIL or SHAMILAT (District)— A district of Persia, bordering the north-west side of the loop [ formed by the Gulfs of Persia and'Oman at their junction; it includes542 SHA—SIIA the port of Bandar Abbas which, however, is not administratively included in the district. The bulk of Shamil lies eastward of Bandar Abbas in the form of a some- I Limitg what elongated parallelogram with its south west corner at that town : the boundaries of this portion are, on the north, a line running from Kuh-i-Namak to Kuh-i- Nian in such a manner as to include Khurgu village and thence crossing the valley of the Shamil river to the Zindan hills ; on the east, the Zindan hills from the Shamil river gap almost to the breach formed by the exit of the Minab river, and, on the south, an imaginary line running from the point last mentioned to the coast at the mouth of the Shamil river and beyond the Shamil estuary the sea-coast as far as Bandar Abbas. To the west of Bandar Abbas the district is irregularly bevelled off to the coast at the mouth of the Kul river ; the northern boundary is first carried south from Kuh-i-Namak to the eastern shoulder of Kuh Ginau, the crest of which it follows westwards to the Kul river ; from the point where the boundary strikes the river to the sea the Kul itself is approximately the boundary, but a few villages, of which the most important are the two Kishars, though lying to the west of the river, are included in the Shamil district. The district is in fact a maritime plain enclosed between the sea and ! Physical characteristics. bold m?™*™ r ™ges, of which the deration generally exceeds 3,000 feet. The dominant feature of the whole country is Kuh Ginau, the summit of which reaches 7,783 feet at a point 18 miles north-north-west of Bandar Abbas. The mountains to the north of the district rise very steeply from the plain and attain 4,481 feet in Kuh-i-Namak at their western end, and 6,057 feet in Kuh Nian at their eastern extremity ; between these points they are interrupted by four gaps through which valleys of some size descend to the plain giving the range a_ disconnected appearance. The Kuh-i-Zindan range, also called the Rudbar hills, at the east of the district, appears to have a nearly constant elevation of over 3,000 feet. A great mountain situated outside the district but visible from the Persian Gulf is Kuh-i-Bakhun which is 42 miles north of Bandar Abbas, 10,660 feet high, and covered with snow in winter. Besides these considerable mountains the district possesses a generally low and in places ill-defined sandstone ridge, which subtends the sea* coast at a distance of from 3 to 10 miles and divides the country into two portions that differ widely in their characteristics; the ordinary height of this ridge is perhaps 200 feet, but at a point 13 miles west by north of Bandar Abbas and 6 from the sea it reaches a height of 1,645 feet. . On the east, this ridge dies away a little beyond Baghu. Between this ridge and the mountains the land is a fertile plain, between it and the coast a sandy plain impregnated with salt and diversified, at intervals ottly? by date groves and small patches o f cultivation. From the sandstone ridge numerous steep-sided ravines, containing no water except during heavy rain, run down to the coast, t. The sea-shore is sandy in its whole extent. | The only valleys of importance are : one without a distinctive name, which enters the district between Kuh-Ginau and Kuh-i-Namak and thatof the Shamil river which enters it between Kuh-i-Nlan and Kuh-i-Zindan. The . former contains a salt stream called the Rud Shur and its channels turning to the south and leaving the villages of Rung and Baghu on its right bank reaches the sea at a point 8 miles east of Bandar Abbas. The bed of the Shamil, divides on entering the district, sending one branch straight to the village of Shamil and thence south-south-east to the sea, while another branch strikes south-westwards until it receives, near Budik village, an affluent from the the hills known as the Jamush when it turns to the south-south-west and rejoins the eastern branch 8 miles from the sea: in the neighbourhood of the coast the united stream bears the name of the Rud Shirm. Both the Rud Shur and the Shamil river vary greatly in volume being sometimes wide rippling streams a few inches in depth and after ram impassable torrents ; the western branch of the Shamil river is fre quently dry. The Rud-i-Kul or Kul river, which bounds the district on the west, is salt and its riparian villages depend on wells for their drinking- water ; near Gurband it receives from the north a stream called the Rud Shur which carries part of the drainage of the southern slopes of the Kuh- Ginau. The remainder of the southern drainage of that mountain is borne by a channel which runs eastwards to Chah Chakur, then breaks through the sandstone coast range and, turning southwards, reaches the sea a very little to the west of the stream from Baghu. The district contains some clear flowing streams and a number of springs, especially in proximity to the hills. The water of most of these is absorbed in irrigation, or by the porous soil, before reaching any channel by which it could be brought to the coast. Mimosa, oleander and the wild caper are among the commonest plants and in places the country is covered with thorny jungle. ^ The climate of Shamil resembles that of Bandar Abbas, but inland the summer heat is even more intense owing to the distance from the sea and the reflection of the sun’s rays from the bare sandy soil. The people of Shamil are of Persian race with probably a considerable Population. infusion of Baluchi and Arab blood and the n . universal language is Persian of a purity which increases with^the distance frcm Bandar Abbas. Arabic is scarcely under stood and Baluchi is not heard except at the eastern end of the district. n the west side o f the mouth of the Shamil river, however, is a cluster o f villages near the coast, of which the inhabitants are all Baluchis speaking both Persian and a debased form of Baluchi. There are no distinct or well-known local tribes. The people are nearly all Shi’ahs with the exception of about a dozen vil lages, all further west than Bandar Abbas, which are either altogether or predominantly Sunni. As subjects the Shamilis are weak, peaceable and oppressed: as cultivators they are idle and unthrifty. The majority li\e in a squalid fashion in date-leaf huts, and as long as they can obtain enough dates to eat they are content to do nothing. In the interior they are cultivators, on the sea -shore fishermen and boatmen: in the season every man, woman and child becomes a date-picker. There are practi cally no arms among them; only a headman here and there owns a rifle or two. The total population, excluding Bandar Abbas, which is not reckoned as part of Shamil, probably amounts to about 25,000 souls.544 SHA—SHA Villages are somewhat numerous, but they are small, and those that possess as many as 100 houses are less than a score. Dates and barley form the staple of cultivation, but in some places wheat and tobacco are grown, and a few villages Agriculture and trace. possess a considerable acreage of henna. In a number of the villages the land is irrigated by means of channels cut from the Shamil river and ether streams ; in a few, irrigation is from wells, the water being raised by means of a balanced pole called ZHbo, similar to that used is Egypt. Elsewhere the crops are grown by rainfall. The grain grown is only sufficient for home consumption ; but there is a small surplus of dates which is exported. Imports are trifling, on account of the poverty of the people, comprising little beyond tea and cotton* goods. The commercial capital of Shamil is Bandar Abbas and the currency, weights and measures of the district are (with some infinitesimal differences) the same as those of the town, except that the Indian rupee is seldom met with in the district. The area of land is generally estimated by mans, that is by the number of mans of seed grain required to sow it. The land-routes which radiate from Bandar Communications and trans- a ]] p e [ n their first stages within the ^° r ' Shamil district. 1. The coast-route from Bandar Abbas to Minab (54 miles) runs within the Shamil district as far as the Shamil river, and the first halting* place, Qulughan (at 24 miles) is in Shamil. Several muddy and swampy streams have to be crossed, which might at any time present difficulties to wheeled carriage, and in wet weather this route would be impracticable.* The remaining stages are noticed in the article on Minab district. 2. The Rah-i-Mian or middle route from Bandar Abbas to Minab runs byDehNau (20 miles) and Jallabi (30 miles) to Gavarband (50 miles), which is on the route from Shamil village to Minab and 18 miles from Minab. This route is said to be a good one, and passable except in very wet weather. This is the route by which caravans for Bam, Kirman, Sistan and Khorasan ordinarily leave the district in winter. 3 . The best known and most frequented route in the district is one still further to the north, which runs from Bandar Abbas by Baghu (15 miles) and Kalkazi (32 miles) to Kushku (50 miles); beyond Kushku it enters the hills by the Tang-i-Zindan or gorge of the Shamil river. This route is free from obstacles—at least in ordinary weather; some streams are crossed here and there, and the plains traversed are hard and stony, there is also some swamp ground just before Kushku. In summer, caravans for Kirman generally leave the district by this route, and it is frequently used by hot weather caravans for Yazd. It is also a section of the Persian postal road between Bandar Abbas and Kirman. 4. The preceding routes are linked together by various cross-roads, which are considerably used. The principal of these is a route from Minab Town to Shamil village, but between Shamil village and Kushku it is bad and liable to be swept by floods. There is also a route, said to be fairly good, which runs due north from Shamil village and joins Route No. 3 near the Tang-i-Zindan.

Ordinary supplies are obtainable throughout Shamil in small quantities biit it is estimated that even a single regiment moving rapidly would have difficulty m subsisting upon the country. Very little transport is available. le on v animals are camels and donkeys, and according to a rough estimate the district possesses only about 700 camels and 1,000 donkeys which could be ill spared by their owners. The district of Shamil is under the Governor of the Gulf Ports ; the local Administration. ruler or Kal antar, is at present Asad Ulla Khan, ■l __ who succeeded his father in the Kalantari. He ms is residence at Ziarat, is virtually independent of the Deputy Governor o widar Abbas and holds his position in virtue of a lease of the revenue n his favour by the Governor. The district is not in fact capable, in its fT- con dion, of paying more than 8,000 tumdns even in a good year r S but nomina % i* was based in 1904 for 11,000 and in 1905 lor 13,000 tumdns. The administration is carried on through the headmen or Kadkhudas each of whom is responsible to the Kalantar for the behaviour and land- revenue of his village. There is no system of police or of civil or criminal pis ice. he land-revenue, which is payable in cash and represents T V of e gross produce as valued by the Kalantar’s Kharrds or assessor, is the onJy recognized form of taxation, but the Kalantar levies as many irregular extra imposts as he can. ' Bccelesiastical authority is not strong in Shamil. The principal families aie that of the Kalantar and another at Shamil village of which Mir Ahmad Shah is the present head.

SIAHAN or SlANEH KUH—Highest Elev. about 8,395'. A range of mountains in Persian Baluchistan, forming for a portion of its length the boundary between Persian and British territory. Its eastern extremity commences approximately in Lat. 63° 30' E., and Long. 27° 20' N., runs in a westerly direction for about 50 miles, as far as the Brinjinan pass, and then turns north-west for another 60 or 70 miles, till Gazu is reached, where it ends abruptly in a valley of the same name.. Towards its north-western termination numerous subsidiary ranges are thrown off, under various nomenclatures, so that it is doubtful if the true Siahan range really extends beyond the Kuh-i-Safid, in about Lat. 62° 10 ', and Long. 28°. North and east this chain is continued by the Mur Pish range, with the GUi Kuh, 9,118 feet, as its highest point. Starting from the Kuh-i-Safid the western and southern drainage of the Siahan runs into the Siitiish river, past Gusht and Dizak, and together with the Ruhtak, flows into theMashkid which turning north after passing the frontier fort of Kuhak, runs eventually into the Mashkid Hdmun, non ' of its waters ever reaching the sea. Its eastern drainage, in the same way, also loses) itself in the Mashkid Hdmun, through numerous rivulets andL 4 C 2 SIA-SIA 571 ! «4tl I; fill. i tlecdt, •(Cdii; ndlas, of which the Nukoda, Jalk and Kaladfn streams are the most important ; but these, however, find their way into the Hdmun by under ground channels, not continuing their whole course on the surface. The chief heights and passes starting from the east are : — (1) A peak near Girdi, 15 miles north-north-east of Kuhak, 5,130 feet. ( 2 ) Getam, 6,517 feet. (3) Buusir pass, 5,137 feet, practicable for laden animals. (4) Brinjlnan pass, 4,600 feet, practicable for wheeled artillery (5) Badamo pass, 6,788 feet. ( 6 ) Dangli pass, 5,633 feet. The range can be crossed at other places, but the passes mentioned above are the only ones practicable for transport animals. . Ti ^ e boundary line between British and Persian territories touching the Siahan Kuh was demarcated by the Holdich Mission in 1896, and runs from a point on the Mashkid river a few miles east of Kuhak, to the crest of the hills close to the Getam peak, and thence nearly due west for 25 miles, when it stiixes practically due north towards Ladgasht, leaving the rest of the range within the Persian borders. The geological'formation of the hills is slaty shale, similar to that of most of the ranges in Western Baluchistan. North of Isfandak and Kalpurkan the rocks are a good deal altered, the shale being converted into hard slate some of it good roofing slate. The general aspect of the hills is abrupt and rugged. The ranges are jagged and broken into bold peaks, their sum mit lines being almost, or quite, impossible to travel along. Towards the edge of the desert on the east and north a sudden change takes place in the surface of the rocks. The steep and craggy ridges are replaced by gently rounded rises of low elevation, sloping away to the boiders of the great desert. It certainly looks as if the lower hills had been rounded by marine or lacustrine denudation, and adds to the probability of the immense plain to the north and east having been the basin of an immense sea. South of the Siahan is a gravel plain, sloping from the base of the hills to the Mashkid. North of the hills the base slope or daman (skirt) is an expanse of hard black gravel, falling gently for about 15 miles to the sandy desert. J Like most ranges in Western Baluchistan, the ridges of the Siahan are so steep and rocky as to be almost impracticable, except at the regxdar and well-known passes.. The sides of the hills are bare, and have generally little or nothing picturesque about them. This range is called Siahan in Baluchi, and Slaneh in Persian, signify ing the “ black hill ”—the former nomenclature is that now generally adopt ed.—(^. John, 1871 ; Holdich, 1901 ; Sykes, 1902.)

The former is situated 100 miles nearly due east of Bampur, and 25 miles east of Magas, and consists of a flourishing settlement, containing some 1,500 families, belonging to the Arbabi race. The town is built on the banks of the Ruhtak river, which flows into the Mashkid, and is surrounded by large date groves and a considerable amount of cultivation, while waterboth from the perennially flowing Ruhtak stream and from larlzes is abundant. Supplies are usually procurable, in good quantities, but in February 1902, when Major Tighe’s expedition visited the place, they were practically non-existent, as the previous year’s crops had been devoured by locusts. Joivari and Jcirbi, however, could then be obtained, but fuel was very scarce, and the camel-grazing was some distance off among the hills. The Sib valley is about 8 miles broad, stony and flat, but is well watered by the Ruhtak, and is bounded on the north-east by the Sunt Kuzak, a range rising to 6,100 feet in altitude. The fort is a strong mud structure well protected by tiers of habita tions, all arranged for defence, and provisioned (in 1902) ready for a siege. The citadel stands about 60 feet high and contains a well. It has the reputation of being one of the strongest in Persian Baluchistan, and owing to the nature of the ground, would be-a difficult one to shell at close range. The villages in the valley are all strongly defended and surrounded by high walls. The district itself is an important one and includes Paskuh, Gusht, Multan, Kant, Hidugeh, and Suran; while its revenue in 1902 was estimated at Rs. 14,500.—-($£.

SIGA PUSHT— A hill and also a stream in Persian Baluchistan, west of Bint. The former is a high hog-backed hill on the right bank of the Pasga river, and is passed somewhere about 24 miles from Bint on the Jashk road. At its foot is one of the numerous zidrats of Pir Tari. The stream enters the Pasga opposite to the hill. The road comes down it for about a mile before reaching the river.— {Floyer.)574 SIG-SIK SIGAEl— A halting-place in Persian Baluchistan, 15 miles north-west of Gwatar on the coast.

Floyer’s route from Kashi to Bint passes under the brow of Sihran at about 15 miles from Pugunzi halting-place on the Karvan Kaur. The track ascends a steep narrow defile, and descends again sharply to the Gari Kaur, in which there appears to be water. Thence a rough road over two ridges to the Sartapi. Sihran Kuh means “ crimson hill,” and Floyer remarks that it was in all lights of a soft rich crimson.

SlMlSH— A stony plain, some 8 miles wide, lying to the north-west of Dizak and between the Sianeh and Mlaneh ranges. It is drained throughout, i.e., from north-west to south-east, by the SImIsh river, which at and below Dizak is known as the Mashkid. Along this river is a good road from Dizak to Gusht, a distance of 39 miles. This latter place lies at the foot of the hills* enclosing this plain on the north, and a good road leads from it to Vasht, in Sarhad, distance 61 miles. Along the SImIsh river water, wood, camel-grazing and grass are said to be plentiful all the way. The plain slopes gently towards the south. Its elevation at the northern end is about 4,800 feet, while at the extreme southern end, at a point on the Mashkid river, a little to the south of Isfandak, the elevation is about 3,400 feet. This would seem to be the best line for a road from Panjgur to Sarhad, though supplies would not be so plentiful as on the Talk road. (Jennings.) SINANl— Elev. 3,720'. A tiny hamlet among the Bampusht hills of Persian Baluchistan, about 15 miles north of Sar-i-Jangan (q.v.). It consists of a few huts with palm groves and cultivation.

SIRGAN or SARGAN— A considerable watercourse which descends from the coast range in Persian Baluchistan, and after a general southerly course of about 30 miles through a flat, sandy plain, falls into the sea immediately west of Ras Puzim. Puzim village, if it still exists, is probably on the estuary of this stream. The Sirgan is crossed by the telegraph route from Gwatar to Jashk at about SIJ miles from Chahbar, and is usually made the third stage from that place. On to the Kair river is 15 miles. The Sirgan is only a running stream after rain, but throughout the winter months a good supply of water may be obtained from holes in its bed. Firewood and camel forage moderate. Goldsmid, between the Kair and Tiz village, crossed a “ Khur Sangam, coming from the hill of Beshiman, which was forded with comparative ease. This can hardly beany other than the Sirgan. Haji ’Abdul Nabi in 1839 halted at a place called Sorkum, one stage north of Pazm (i.e., Puzim). This too may have been on the Sirgan. According to the telegraph map, the Sirgan rises west of, and near, a peak marked as Chandari Kuh, about 8 miles north of the halting-place.

SlSA PUSHT (Persian Baluchistan)— A mountain in the Lashar range, south of the Bampur desert.- [Jennings) SISAD— 1 . Two villages in Makran, situated on the banks of the Babu nver, 30 miles west of Siroki on the Dasht, 10 miles south-east of Dashtiari, and “bout 32 miles north-west of Gwatar, to which there is a direct road. The Rahii river in this neighbourhood has, within recent times, changed its course nearly 4 miles to the west, and thus has made desolate a country ill at was formerly well cultivated and flourishing. Mr. Janes, who 7 visited it in 1900, writes At 7 miles west o Kimdau we reached Balur Mach, from which place we passed through a 1 angle of brushwood for 2 miles, and again through neglected fields to the old course of the Bahu river, 3*25 miles from Balur Mach. This river was almost dry, 60 feet from bank to bank, and 21 feet deep. Its banks were once fringed with magnificent babul trees, which are now withered, presenting a most dreary aspect. Extensive fields on both banks were formerly watered by this stream, but since tbe river has taken a new course, these have been fallow. Ruins of villages scattered over the country gave a most desolate appearance to the scene. Intact, the whole country from Rimdan, except Balur Mach, had the same aspect. This desolation is attributed partly to the Bahu river having taken a westerly course and to the scanty rainfall for the past five years, but mainly to oppression from the Persian officials. The distance measured between the new and tte old course of the stream is 3 '8 miles.’’ , , East Sisad, lying on the west bank of the old course of the river and 11 m iles from'it, is a village containing some 15 families of Jadgals. Supplies are procurable in moderation, and water, from a large and deep surface reservoir, remains throughout the year.SIS—SUG 579 West Sisad appears to lie at some distance from East Sisad, but no parti culars are available. The Balm river, at its crossing here, is 625 feet wide from bank to bank. No water was flowing in April 1900, but it was standing some 2 feet deep in parts. Both banks are irregular and steep, and the bed is dangerous on account of quicksands. A few camels can be hired in the district.— [Janes, 1900.)

There is no water here ; the ordinary halting-place is at Nur Muhammad Kariz, some 6 miles back towards Shandak. Unlimited grass, camel-grazing and wood on the road. The wd/Jd joins the Darinchah and Shandak ndlds, and the combined stream flows through a gorge between the Rizabad range and Bazman Kuh to Narmashir. From the halting-place the road ascends a valley some 2 miles wide between the Jauil Band and the Suiabur Kuh, and at about 4 miles crosses the watershed above mentioned. Height 5,490 feet.

Supplies, are abundant and forage plentiful. The following are given as the villages comprised in the district Pogi, Khan Malik, Kalaki, Khan Karam Shah, Khan Mir, Magas, and Gonpusht. There does not appear to be any particular village of the nameof Suhran, but it is the term applied to the whole sub-district. This place, with Paskuh, is within the administrative boundaries of Sib.— {Sykes 1894 ’ Shaikh Mohi-ud-din, 1895.) SUHRBUH— Elev. 2,400'. A high peak on the coast range north of Chahbar Bay.

Ascent and descent of about 20 feet and easy; height, 4,744 feet. This can be turned on either side, and the hills are only about 20 feet higher than the kutal. This is the watershed separating the Bug ndld flowing to the Talab river, from the Andai ndld flowing to the Ladis Kaur. For the last 11 miles on the Talab side of this kutal the country is volcanic and destitute of vegetation, except a few stunted tamarisks and tufts of camel-thorn LeiC and there, and there is no water nearer than at the Bug halting-place, 11 miles back.— {Jennings.)

It is about 12 miles from the Sadaich and 16J miles from Kashi. There is a well of good water. Firewood and camel-grazing abundant. A flat sandy plain ex tends on the one side to the Sadaich ; on the other for about 4 miles to the mass of low hills through which the road and telegraph line passes to Kashi. JNorth the country appears to be open to the coast ranges and south to the sea. In January 1876 Floyer found about 200 acres of wheat and cotton some distance south of the camping-ground. The cultivators were nearly all slaves. J Lonmerm 1908 reports a scattered village of 150 huts of low class tribes and a few Hots. There were 100 date palms and barley and joivari were grown. The people possessed 200 camels, 50 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. The characteristics of the Surag district are those of the Dasht generally. {See Dasht.)

On the next march he followed for some miles the broad bed of the “ Tenk ” river, remarkable for its high and steep banks. He says the bed of the stream was finer than that of the Kair (q.v.) ; but he met the former in the hills, where all watercourses have larger channels than in the plain, owing to the constant changing and shifting of the latter in the sandy soil.

Long. 61° 2' 28' Elev. 3,538' — 4,482'. The principal village in Sarhad {q.v.), in the southern part of that district, of which it is said to be the one permanently inhabited spot; the people are said to be a wild nomadic race, averse to building regular habita tions. General Gasteiger Khan, an Austrian officer in the Persian service, passed through Vasht (which he calls Chash) on his way from Bampur to Jalk in February 1881. The fort was then in ruins, having been destroyed by the Persians seven years previously. It was surrounded by neglected orchards and a few ruined dwellings. The portion of the Sarhad plateau in the neighbourhood of Vasht is naturally very fertile “and the remains of irrigation canals may be noticed, but the whole place is at present in ruins and presents a most dismal appearance. On the dried-up plains a few miserable huts are to be seen and here and there cattle graze on the scanty herbage. “ This is a good country for sport, and abounds with gazelle (? ibex) sheep (? uridl), wild asses, panthers (?leopards), wolves and hyenas.” The elevation of the Sarhad plateau about Vasht is between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. To the south-east it appears to slope steadily towards the • Magas and Sib valleys, but on the east and west towards the Dizak valley (Gusht) and the Bampur plain there must be a considerable and perhaps606 VAS-VAS abrupt descent, though-at some distance from Vasbt. The climate ia therefore cold in winter, more especially at night, when severe frosts are probably not uncommon. The summer no doubt is pleasant. A certain amount of supplies procurable at any time of year. HajI Abdul Nabi visited it in 1838. He went from Sib up the valley in a north-westerly direction and reached Vasht (which he calls Gwash) in 5 marches, aggregating 37 kos. Apparently the country is perfectly open the whole way. From Vasht the Haj! went towards Bampur, reaching Rindigan in 2 stages of 8 kos each (24 to 30 miles ?) over a good road.” Gasteiger, however, was 5 days between Rindigan and Vasht, and seems to have found the first march or two difficult, until he got on to the plateau. Daffadar Kalandar Khan visited this place in 1885, having been detached from Captain Jenning’s party to explore the road from Gusht to Vasht. He reached this place by a road from Jalk via Gusht. The road is easy for camels the whole way with the exception of the Badamo pass {q.v.). From Bampur, Vasht is distant about 100 miles, the greater part of this route was visited by Captain Jennings. For list of nomad tribes, vide Baluchistan. The most influential tribe is one of the smallest, the Yarahmadzai, only aggregating some 50 families, but owing to their raiding propensities, a hegemony has been established, so that they control perhaps a 1,000 families. The Kurds who were at one period the leading tribe, number now about 20 families. The total popula tion of Sarhad was estimated in 1900 at 8,000 families, 40,000 souls. The new fort is built on the site of the old one, in the centre of the plain -o . between Kuh-i-Panj Angusht and Kuh-i- Konas: it can be seen for some seven miles off. At a distance it looks as imposing as it is the reverse when visited. It is rhomb oidal in shape, the new addition being built on to a part of the old fort. From north to south the breadth is 75 paces, and from east to west 95. The walls are some 20 feet high, of rammed mud, and thin. There is a turret at each corner, with a staircase leading up it. There are no banquettes round the walls and the fort is unarmed. In the centre of the north face is the main gateway ; a small private gate in'the south face opens on to a neglected garden. The interior Very much resembles a sarai ; many of the offices and godowns are crumbling away owing to the sandy nature of the earth of which they are made. This is on the authority of the Sartip, who also stated that his quarters were dangerous and the plaster all falls off. The Sartip’s quarters are opposite the main gate. Horses, mules, camels and donkeys are tethered all round the walls of the unpaved courtyard, and feeding troughs are let into the walls. There is no water-supply within the fort, but mashaks hanging from tripods are seen in front of the quarters. There is an utter want of any drainage or sanitary arrangements ; the ground is consequently saturated with all sorts of pollution. The garrison consisted in 1894 of the Sartip or general, 1 sultan, 2 ndibs, Strength of the garrison. f Smvars ’ 80 Mjambas 3 blacksmiths, 3 carpenters and 2 leather-workers. It is cot known what is the strength of the present garrison, which was increased m 1902.Consequent on the presence of a garrison, supplies are scant here and all Resources of Vaaht, supplies, the. cultivation in the vicinity is under the © tc * supervision of the Sartip. Barley, wheat, jowdrl cotton, and lucerne are grown and the crops are good. There is no grass or grazing, other than coarse cam el-grazing, anywhere in the district, and the statements of Captain Jennings’ surveyor, Dafadar Kalandar Khan who visited the place in 1885, are most misleading. Water is obtained from kdrizes and is plentiful and sweet: the supply could be increased by repair ing the old ones. The area of cultivation could be very considerably im proved as the soil is naturally fertile. Fuel is scant and has to be brought from a distance. There is an entire absence of trees over the plain, though some fine mulberry, willow and other trees flourish near the water rills by the fort. From its elevated position and proximity of the lofty Chilan Kuh, the climate is heallty all the year round. There is a hot spring here, the water of which is conveyed by a brick built channel from 1| miles above the fort :its temperature remains fairly con stant at 75° F. The position of Vasht is of considerable importance, being the centre of many practicable roads : From Vasht to Vid Remarks. Chahbar •• •• •• Magas, Irafshan or Sarbaz.

BALUCH AB— Here there is a ruined tower with a spring at the west side, giving a plenti ful supply of slightly brackish water. To the east of the tower are several small water channels, and, in places, water oozes out of the ground.— {Norris, 1910.) BANDAR ABBAS— The British Consulate compoimd is an eight-sided building stand ing in the open, but with dead ground on the west at a distanco of 500 yards, and rising sandhills to the north and east, 800 yards away. A ridge of rock parallel to these sandhills commands the Con sulate at long range, 1,^00 f 10 2,000 yards. C 0109 GSBJ (St BAN—BEH It is proposed to fortify the angles by defensible flanking towers and to raise the wall to 8 feet. A maxim on the roof of the Consulate or telegraph building would command all the ground for from 500 to 1,000 yards all round. Th'i consulate is now prepared for defence if necessary (1911). BASHAKARD DISTRICT— Beyond Motiari the country for several miles west is a wilderness of jagged shar peaks, apparently about 100 feet high. Through these runs the Rabg road, after leaving the Rabg tanqi. Thmpart of the country is an absolute desert.— (Craufurd, 1910.) BASHIB— fltdo’ Bishir. BASHIND— A small hamlet on the road between Galag and Bint. 14 miles from Galag, on the Rapch river. The river widens here to about a mile wide.—(CVau/wrd, 1910.) BAUNI— In Biaban. Water from wells.—(CVau/urd, 1910.) BEHMADI PASS- A pass in Bashakarl, which begins a mile north of Tehbar. At first it is a mile wide. After 3 miles it narrows to 500 yards. Another mile further on b passes through a narrow Lawji, 20 yards wide. The narrow cart is called the Tang-i-Duhl. It extends for 100 yards and ,s only 20 vards broad under mud cliffs. Water comes down from the Ziam fanai as far as this narrow portion. Although running and clear, the water owing to surface salt, is too bitter to drink. The hills then open out somewhat, and at 7 miles from Tehbar, three ndlds meet. The westerly ndld leads to the Rabg tangi: the easterly one to the Kvark road * the northerly one to Marak. At 8| miles from Tehbar the hills onen out. Up to this point, the hills on the eastern side are one continuous cliff They form the Gaigan plateau, which stretches the whole way south toGaiean. The plateau is cut up in every direction by deep ndlds On the western side, the hills are very steep, but not cliffs They are the T*oV»madi hills Four main spurs run north 3f which the mo t western, Motiari, is some 6 miles distant. The country to the north is cut off by the Surkh Kuh.— (Gtaufurd, 1910). BEHMADI RIVER— The Behmadi river near the coast is 200 yards wide and would prove an obstacle in wet weather. BEHMADI— Behmadi, according to Mir Mustafa, Chief of Jashk, applies to the plain at the mouth of the Behmadi Pass and includes Nigwar, and the well at Tehbar at the mouth of the pass. There is no nearer village to the pass owing to fear of raids from Bashakard.—(Oau/urrf, 1910.) &gt; ij.B1A—CHA 3 BIABAN— Lina 18. Substitute —“ Between*' Kuh-i-BIaban and the sea lies a well- defined subsidiary range, called after the various villages it passes, which starts from the coast at Kuhistak and after trending some miles inland re joins the coast at Kuh Mubarak. This range is composed entirely of sand stone and assumes the grotesque and curious shapes common to the Makran hills. It attains its highest point, 900 feet, at Karai Jump, 3 miles south of Karai. The range divides Biaban into two natural divisions. To the west the country is a flat plain in which lie the majority of the villages in the dis trict. To the east is a succession of small valleys cut off from each other by outlying spurs from either range and by rugged pla'caus of shur formation. Line 27.—Dele “ the Karai and.” Page 89.—Adi to first paragraph :—“ Both theGaz and Zangali rivers are impregnated with alkali and are unfit for consumption by man or beast, except for ten days after spate. Water lies in pools in both rivers throughout the year, but is only used by ibex and oorial. Add to “ Inhabitants ” :—Many of the inhabitants are semi-nomad and huts are re novi d from grove to grove. The number of huts thus only serves as a rough guide to the importance of a place. Wells are seldom cleaned but fresh ones are dug as the old ones fill in or the population increa ses.— (Craufurd, 1910.) BIAI— A little place on the Makran coast, 4 miles west of Kunarak.— (Crau furd 1910.) BlSHlR— Bas ib in gazetteer. Two hamlets in Biaban. Upper Bishir, which is 2 miles from the main hamlet, has a mud mosque, and ruins of other mud buildings, showing a former prosperity, 4 huts and one well. Lower Bishir is the main hamlet. It contains some fine trees.— (Craufurd, 1910.) BUDING— More probably Budi. A valley in Bashakard on the Jagin river. It is about 1 mile in diameter, well-wooded, and an important winter encamp ment, but empty at other times of the yeai.—(Craufurd, 1910.) c CHAH-I-MUHAMMAD RIZA— One hut not much cleaner than a cattle shed. Several wells, but only one (1910) contains at the outside 2 pailsfull of dirty green water.— (Soaks, 1910.)— —CHA—GAI CHAHPIRI— No well at this place. Brackish water can bo obtained by digging shal low holes. The Kunamai river is 54 yards broad here, but as a rule the water in the river does not come up to this spot.— (Norris, 1910.) D DAST-I-GIRD— A village of 570 houses in the Sunnlkhaneh buluk of the Kaln district, 6 miles to the south of Tabas. It consists of a cluster of domed mud houses, and is watered by a slightly salt kariz. Fairly good water can bo ob tained from a spring close by. 24 camels, 400 donkeys. The normal annual production of grain is about 6,000 Indian maunds. The headman is Muhammad Yusuf Khan, who owns several other villages in the neigh bourhood.— (Dobbs, 1903 ; Keyes, 1904; Gibbon, 1908.) Note. —Probably the same as Dastgird or Dastjirdun. DUHL, TANG-I vide Behmadi Pass. FAIG RIVER— In Biaban. Flows into the Gaz. Only rises in the coast range.— (Craufurd, 1910.) rEHRAJ, RUD-I— In 1909 there was water in this river almost to Tum-i-Rig. The bed comes to an end almost opposite the wells.— (Norris, 1910.) G GAIGAN,— Town and Pass.- Gaigan consists of about 12 wattle huts, and 2 wells in the ndld bed. Some date palms. Inhabitants are Baluchis. Large number of goats and a few fat-tailed sheep. • The country is either very flat or very hilly. The dividing line is very sharp. The country is almost waterless. The mountains consist of great slopes of bare rock, the slant invariably being from east to west. On reach ing the highest point, the slope breaks off in a sheer drop, which varies from 20 feet in the foothills to nearly 1,000 feet on Gaigan mountain. The hills are in consequence very difficult for men to traverse and quite im passable for camels. The only roads are sandy camel tracks. If a detachment from Jashk was attacking an enemy at Gaigan, the latter would probably hold the foothills, east and south-east of Gaigan, and would endeavour to escape by the Behmadi (Gaigan?) Pass. There is no other practicable road by which they could get their camels away %ii GAI—GAT 5 The enemy themselves might retire up the Soldar road or the Gaigan nala, but neither of these are practicable for baggage animals. Any force attacking Gaigan should, therefore, send a party round south-west to block the Behmadi (?) road, especially as Gaigan is quite open to attack from the south-west, but is difficult to attack from the east and south east owing to the foothills. If the Gaigan Pass is held by the enemy, it must be turned from the south. The clifis of Gaigan mountain are quite 1,000 feet high and extend for miles, while the mountain is quite waterless. The ridge to the south of the pass is comparatively low, and offers no especial difficulties to operations, except that, as the whole country approaching it is very bare, concealment and surprise are difficult. A large crag juts out near the west end of the pass on the north side. This would certainly be held by the enemy. It can be turned by an advance over the south ridge. The crag is very steep and difficult to climb if approached up the pass. The latter is very flat and open and is commanded throughout by the crag. There is no water either for a defending or attack ing force nearer than Gaigan on the east, or a well 3 miles from the crag on the west. The mountains are exceedingly precipitous and steep, giving a great deal of cover to an enemy occupying them. There is, however, next to no water on them. Consequently it is unlikely that they would be held in force, though one or two snipers might annoy people in the plains very consider ably. The nalas almost always run between clifls. The Gaigan main ndld does this, and it would be very difficult to climb out of it suddenly. {White, 1910.) Note. — White calls this the Behmadi Pass. Craufurd says it is the Gai gan Pass. White's report has therefore been corrected, and where there is a doubt a ? is shown. GAIGAN PASS— A pass in Bashakard. It is formed by the Gaigan mountains and a subsidiary range. The pass lies 2 miles south-west of Gaigan village. It is not part of the Behmadi Pass, and could be avoided by marching further south.— {Craufurd, 1910.) GANGAN— Village in Biaban. About 30 houses.

It would not be possible to render the Kirman Consulate defensible. The Consulate garden which, as is usual in Persia, is enclosed by high mudKIR—LAD 9 walls, is one of a large group of gardens contiguous to one another, known collectively as the Bagh-i-Zirisf. Of the wall surrounding the Consulate enclosure, a length of about 30 yards, at the entrance, faces the avenue approaching it. Elsewhere the enclosure is surrounded by gardens with their trees and buildings. Were all these gardens and buildings dismantled the Consulate would still be far from being a defensible post. It is commanded to the east, south and west by two old forts and by positions in the hills surrounding it, at distances varying from a quarter to three- quarters of a mile. In short the position of the Consulate was evidently not selected with regard to its defensibility, and its natural disadvantages from this point of view are insuperable. KIRI— A place in Bashakard.

Has not been very successful, and has returned to India, leaving his business in the hands of an agent. 2. Seth Sulaiman is the only reliable trader in Sistan. He has been there over 10 years, and owing to the people being in debt to him, is able to exact a modicum of punctuality from the natives in their transactions with him.— (Noake, 1910.) NAWAR CHAH— On Robat-Sistan road. Caravanserais, having each two rooms, which look like stables and are used as such. One well is open and contains most disgustingly dirty water, in which camel-dung can be tasted even when the water is drunk as cocoa.— (Noake, 1910.) NIGW AR- Is the village of the Behmadi plain and is often referred to erroneously as Behmadi. A date grove with 3 huts in the north-east corner of the Behmadi plain.— (Craw/urd, 1910.) P PILPILAK— The point in Bashakard where the Sharifi stream joins the Jagin xiver. — (Craujurd, 1910.) Q QALAMUl— In Biaban. 12 huts; 3 wells.— (Craujurd, 1910.) R RAHIMABAH, BURJ-I-— A ruined tower on the southern extremity of Zangi Ahmad. Some channels to the east contain a little water which probably comes from the Tahurd river. The nearest water is at Muhammad ’Ali Khan, a mile or so north west.— (Norris, 1910.) RAPCH RIVER— Perennial and sweet water. An open roadstead, but good shelter for small craft behind the bar. Bar has shoaled 1911, and cannot be used at all tides ■. even by small boats.-—(Craw/wnZ, 1911.)*A 12 RIG—SAR RIG CHAH— On Robat-Sistan road. Caravanserais with two rooms. Any quantity of fuel and camel-grazing. One well, 75 feet deep, 3 feet diameter, 4 feet water, February 1910. No supplies of any kind.—(2Voa£e, 1910.) RUD-I-MAHI RIVER— East of the junction of the Rud-i-Mahi and Shuru rivers there was no water in the Rud-i-Mahi (December 1909) until near Mazar Ab spring. At this place the river-bed is about 30 yards wide and 10 feet deep. The bed comes to an end close to the sp Ing near wh : ch there is a lot of vegetation. The water in the spring is salt and the place has a bad reputation on account of mosquitoes. After issuing from the mountains the Rud-i-Mahi takes a bend to the south-west. About two miles from the pass is a patch of Baluch cultivation. Here the bed is 235 yards wide. A little below this is the canal that fertilises Haidarabad. The water not diverted into the canal (jub) is soon lost in the plain. The river-bed breaks up into innumerable channels, but in times of flood the water again collects and flows through a pass in the Haidarabad hills. Water divides at west end of pass, part flowing towards Gui’g and part towards Mazar Ab spring—(Worm, 1910.) rGdkhaneh— A place near Minab.—(Crau/tird, 1910.) RT}D-I-SHIB-I-AB— One of the main canals of Sistan. It is very deep, and is crossed at Mu- hammadabad, either by a ferry boat of reeds, or at a ford on the north side of the village.— (Noake, 1910.) RUSTAM KA KALEH— A large, old, and partly ruined fort, 19 miles north of Girdi Chah on the road from Robat to Sistan. It has a moat round it, which usually contains rain water until May. This is probably the same as Hauzdar, though Noake says that natives pointed out another village 3 miles west as Hauzdar. — (Noake, 1910.) s SAGAR RIVER— A river in Bashakard, which flows into the Sharifi. The river forms the road from Jaghdan to Yakdar.—(Oaw/urd, 1910.) SHAHBAN —vide Jaghdan. SARHINGI DISTRICT— Lies to the north-east ofKurandab. It is a shingly plateau, north-east of Chakansur hill, thinly dotted with thorn scrub.— (Craufurd, 1910.)SAR—SHU 13 SARZEH VALLEY— InBiaban, some 7 miles from north to south, 5 miles from east to west. The Gaz river roughly divides the valley in half from east to west. The river is lined by a thick tamarisk jungle. Almost the whole valley is dotted over by babul trees of fair size. The Kuh-i-Biaban shuts in the valley on a line drawn roughly north and south through Sarzeh. The south-east comer of the valley is bare. Most of the cultivation is round Sarzeh and south of the Gaz river. To the north of the river are the two hamlets of Gwaj and Maihmanl. The valley is, for Makran, very fertile, and could bear much more extended cultivation. Water good and sufficient for half brigade. South-east of the valley lies a hill stronghold called Kalat Banau. The valley is shut in on the south by a horse-shoe sandstone range, some 300 feet high, and steeply scarped on the southern face. The fort stands on a spur of a low ridge, which commands a plain stretch ing to a distance of 2,000 yards.— (firaufurd, 1910.) SARZEH tangi— In Biaban. 10 miles from Bandar Sirik. The tangi is in places nearly a mile wide. All the hills slope from the west, and are steeply scarped on the east. They afford excellent cover, to a force marching from the sea. The tangi extends for about a mile and then enters the Sarzeh valley through a pass between inaccessible hills about 400 yards wide. This is the only point whore the road is really commanded from the west.— (Craufurd, 1910.) SHARIFI RIVER— A stream in Bashakard. It is joined by the Hashdahdar river, about 14 miles north-north-west of Marak. The river-bed is about half mile across and well-wooded with small tamarisk bushes. Water from shallow pools* which have a slight underground flow, following down the stream, the hills to the north are the Chashu range and to the south the Majai. At 3 miles from the junction with the Hashdahdar, the Sagar river comes in from the north. A mile further on the river takes a bend to the south-east round the northern spur of Samokhi. The valley widens to 1 mile, with babul trees and large tamarisks. There are small patches of cultivation, but no settlements. After a further course of 4 miles through fairly well-wooded country the stream flows into the Jagin river at Filpifok.—(Craufurd, 1910.) SHIRAN— A village of Biaban, in a small valley 1 mile across. 24 houses; 4 wells of good water.— (Craufurd, 1910.) SHURGAZ RIVER— Bed formed by the junction of the Rud-i-Mahi and Kunarnai streams. The bed is in places well defined and a mile wide; in others it is almost un- traceable.— (Norris, 1910.)14 SHU—SUR SHUR, RUD-I— The Gurg river (probably called the Rud-i-Shur) is the result of the drain age from country extending from the Rud-i-Mahi pass on the south-east to the mountains nearly due north. Its principal source seems to be the river that comes through the Daribandan (Dar-i-Biaban ?) Pass. In December 1909 there was water in the river from about 6 miles north-east to about H miles south-west of the telegraph. Near where it crosses the telegraph line the bed is about 15 feet deep.—(iVorm, 1910.) SHURU RIVER— A little west of the junction of the Shuru and Rud-i-Mahi streams there was a little running water (December 1909) which came from the Shuru. East of the junction there was no water in the Rud-i-Mahi until near Mazar Ab spring.— (Norris, 1910.) SHUSI SHABAJ— A ruined fort, 14 miles north of Girdi Chah.—(Voa&amp;e, 1910.) SIKUI— In Biaban. 200 huts and a fort in ruins. A mosque and one or two mud buildings.— (Craufurd, 1910.) SIRIK— In Biaban. Some six mud houses. 150 huts. Residence of Mir Haji, Zabit of Biaban. Supplies in small quantities. The whole of the date groves and hamlets around are sometimes called Sirik. Supplies and trans port for half a brigade could probably be obtained through the Mir of Biaban, sufficient for one or two days. Water from wells. Owing to the extensive marshes at the mouth of the Gaz river, Bandar Sirik is the only suitable place to land. Possibly at spring tides a steam-launch might be able to cross the bar to Sirik creek, and tow the boats up a mile, thus saving 3 miles. — (Craufurd, 1910.) SUGARU— Lies 2 miles up the Jagin river from Lad, near the junction of the Jagin and Chavauk. There is a little cultivation.—(Oaa/urd, 1910.)

BINT — The Bint valley is a circular basin, about 1| miles across. Cultivation is mainly confined to the south-east side. The Khans’ house is on the southern edge of the date groves, and clear of the trees. In its immediate vicinity is one of the chief clusters of houses. The fort is 2 miles to the west and CT16 GSB2 BIN—GAZ is inhabited by the Khan’s Wthers. It is surrounded by another large cluster of huts. The valley is shut in on all sides except the south by steep hills. Looking northwards towards Fanuch, the hills rise in successive tiers towards the Band-i-Nilag. The valley appears fertile, though stony. The water is as clear as crystal. The date-groves in which Bint proper is situated lie immediately under Sipurg, a conical hill which encloses it on the north-east, north, and north-west.

Including the rayats he might raise possibly 2,000. (Austin, 1910.) G GALAG— Roadstead open ; anchorage in 7 fathoms, 3 miles from shore ; holding ground good. Good landing just inside entrance of creek on ear;t side, on a steep beach. Men can land dryshod. Ships, boats can en er creek in fine weather at half tide. If too much sea to enter the creek the best landing is about l£ miles east of creek on a good steep beach.

There was nothing in that year to prevent military operations on a large scale in April. The sun was indeed hot by day, but the nights were pleasant and cool. No reliance can be placed on the wells shown on the maps (degree sheets up to the end of 1910) as they frequently do not exist. The whole of the maritime plain in 1911 (spring) abounded with good grass and camel graz ing.4 Fire the ms An one of to the MARIK This It if a dist; The miles clay I The mile f by a f of roc The a subs north torrei Pushf from Th soutli 700 f nortli at its a shu Th apart both A moui bend the s the l over. Tc in a to tl cup f whicI * 4 . MAK—MAR Firewood is obtainable everywhere in large quantities, (presumably on the maritime plain). An advance inland from the coast, for a force of any size, must be up one of the four rivers, Rapch, Jagln, Sadaich, or Gaz. Everything points to the Rapch being by far the best line.— (Delamain, 1911). MARIK Defile— This pass forms the main line of communication from Blaban to Basha* hard. It corresponds to the Behmadi Pass from Jashk. It is reached from the coast vid Bandar Sirik and the Sarzeh \ alley a distance to about 20 miles. The pass is formed by two main ridges or ranges of sandstone, some o miles apart, the intervening distance being filled by spurs of s/mr or blue clay formation, which are an extension of the Kalat Shaikan range of hills.* The pass is entered by a gorge running between sandstone cliffs about one mile south-east of Gwaj hamlet. From the west these hills are accessible bv a stiff climb over gravel foot-hills ; but on the east they rise in a series of rocky precipices. The road runs east for | mile and then bends sharply to the south round a subsidiary ridge of sandstone, for 500 yards, and then again turns to the north-west. At this point a path leads north by a narrow and precipitous torrent bed into the hills and affords a short cut to Divan, by which Pushak at the head of the pass, if hold in considerable force, might be turned from the south. The country then opens out to a valley about 1 mile square. To the south-east it is shut in by a succession of shur ridges rising to some bOO or 700 feet above the surrounding plain. The river and road run in an east- north-east direction and the valley is commanded by a small plateau at its eastern end, some 150 feet above the plain, and at the extremity of a shur spur. The plateau is, however, somewhat inaccessible. The valley runs for the next 2 miles between shur ridges, J to f of a mile apart. These peaks are, from their inaccessibility, practically denied to both friend and foe alike. A series of broken plateaux, where at all accessible, afford positions for mountain guns to cover the movement of troops. At 3 miles the road again bends to the north for another | mile and passes under the lower slopes of the sandstone ridge, which forms the eastern boundaries of the pass. At the bend this ridge rises at a slope too precipitous for infantry to manoeuvre over. . To the north, subsidiary sandstone spurs run down to the river, ending in a sheet of precipitous rock on their eastern face, fhe river then bends, to the ea&amp; again round one of these spurs and the valley opens out into a cun some 1 000 yards across, surrounded on all sides by sharp-poimcd pcaxs whid command the cup at about 3,500 yards range.

These ridges attain their maximum height in the main ridge which forms the eastern boundaries to the pass. The main position of an enemy holding the defile would probably be across tl.e three ridges betwoen the cup above mentioned and the eastern entrance to the pass. This was the case in 1911. Positions for mountain artillery are to be found on the low spurs forming the eastern rim of the cup, from which it is possible to cover the advance of the infantry and shell an enemy retiring through the mouth of the pass. Immediately to the east of the pass the country opens' out into the Pushak valley, a plain about a mile wide and bounded on the east by a high hill (1,C00 feet ? ) of shur and sandstone. The road here forks, that to the south leading to Bashakard via Divan, that to the north via Sfehra-i-Gurg. The road rid Divan appears to run up a narrow glen and probably crosses into Jaghdan by a pass over the Brahing (Brang) Kuh. On the Sahra-i-Gurg road, a succession of gravel hills about 100 feet high connect the hills, which form the northern boundary of the Marik Pass, with the above-mentioned high shm hill across the Pushak plain, and shut in the plain to the west. Beyond these again rises a high sandstone ridge some 4 males distant. The dasht or open plain of Sehra-i-Curg, in which the hamlet of that name is situated, is said to lie m mediately to the noith-east of this sand stone ridge. The road from here on to Jaghdan is reported to be fairly open, and the pass at Band-i-Kalaehu appears to be through a wide open gap in the hills. The sandstone ridges, which shut in the eastern end of the Marik Pass, all end in steep sheet rock cliffs, almost impossible for foot-hold even for ibex. The precipitous nature of the hills on the north thus renders it difficult for an enemy to hold their position for any length of time without sacrificing their chance of making good their retreat. The effect of the general formation of the bills is to make the pass appear a more formidable position than in reality it should prove to be.— (Craufurd, 1911.) minab— The port of Minab is Sar Suragi.— (Craufurd, 1911.) N NASRATABAD SlPl— West of Nasratabad Sip! the country is open but desert of a very for bidding nature, and although enquiries go to establish the fact that a trackcrosses it, yet these enquiries also show that it would he dangerous in the extreme to cross this country except perhaps in winter as it is devoid of water, fuel and grazing.— (Webb-Ware, 1911.) NIGOR (1)— 12 or 13 miles from Bris. 40 or 50 gardens. Vegetables procurable. Inhabitants friendly. Water in plenty from wells. Grazing abundant for camels and mules from sparse bush.— (Austin, 1910.) NOGI — Half way between Mehan and Muri Ktih.—(CVow/tmZ, 1911). P PUSHAK Defile— The Pushak position is situated at the eastern end of the Marik defile (q.v.). The position covers the approach to Sahra-i-Gurg from the sea. The defile consists of an outer ridge of sandstone at either end, enclosing a mass of jagged shur hills, practically inaccessible to friend or foe. Beyond, i.e., east of the pass, the country appears to open out.Immediately to the east is an open valley, 2 miles across and shut in by high shur hills. Some 2 miles beyond these hills and on the northern side of the river, rises an abrupt ridge of sandstone. Beyond this second ridge, according to native information, lies the open country of Sahra-:-Gurg.—(Grou/urd, 1911.) PUSHT-I-MIrAbAD— A spot near Rampk where there is a big spring of water, and excellent grazing for camels. Used as a camping ground by the gun-runners, 1911.— (Craufurd, 1911.) R RAPCH River— A fine stream of excellent water. Be ween Bint and Kurandab it flows through a narrow valley seldom more than 1 mile wide. The hills on both sides are neither high nor difficult. It is here known as the Bint river. Entrance. —The entrance is closed by a bar with two channels, of which the one to the east is the better. At high tide, the channel is about 50 yards wide, and from 9 to 10 feet deep at the entrance. Boats can only enter in fine weather as a moderate breeze is sufficient to make the bar impassable, especially when the tide is running out. Landing places. —Once inside the bar, there is a good landing place on the beach of the east bank of the river, about 600 yards from the mouth. When the bar is impassable, an open beach about 600 yards east of the mouth affords a fairly good landing place though troops landing there would pro bably get wet. Channels. —The channel averages at low tide 3 to 4 feet in depth, all the way up the river until opposite the village of Galag. Here it increases by about 2 feet. Beyond the village, round a bend of the channel up the mainRAP—SHE 7 stream for a short distance, the average depth at low water is about 3 feet. The channel can be followed at high water, as local fishermen have erect ed stumps of trees to mark it. The rise of tide inside the entrance is 9 feet. Water.—According to the local inhabitants, fairly good water is obtain able by digging, anywhere at a distance from the banks of the river. WtAer is nearest the surface in hollows of the sandhills behind Galng, where it is found at an average depth of feet. Near the coast on the east side of the mouth, water is not found until a depth of 5 or 6 feet. When wells are dug they must be revetted, as if left to themselves they will silt up in 24 hours. The main stream appears to be salt for 3 miles above the village. Camping grounds.— There is a fairly good camping ground for a small force on the cast bank of the river about 100 yards from the mouth. W'ith a big tide, or during flood, however, the ground to the north and east is liable to be inundated. Water at 5 feet below the surface on camping ground. There is said to be a good camping ground, with a good supply of water about 5 miles up the main stream, which would probably be preferable to the loose and penetrating sand in the vicinity of Galag and all along the east bank of the river. Anchorage.— Depth of water at 8,400 yards from river mouth, is 36 feet at high water, falling to 27 at low water. Forage. —The grass obtained in the Rapch valley during April 1911 was described as “ magnificent ” grazing for the transport animals. It extends up to the Kurandab pass.—(floe, 1910; Delamain, 1911 ; Crauf urd, 1911.) RAYlN— The list of villages under Rayin (2), page 494, belongs to Rayin (1), page 492.

The water of the Bampur river is good, and there is very little shur deposit in the valley. The wheat crop was ripening early in April 1912. There is very good black partridge shooting, pig and deer abound, and duck are obtainable on the river. Climate.—The shade temperature varied between 51° and 90° on March 22nd-24th, 1912. The general appearance of the valley and its climate does not impress one unfavourably. The extremely bad climate attributed to Bampur in the Gazetteer is much overdone, and is evidently inspired by Persians, who, as is well known, are unable to stand even the heat of Bam, which lies 1,600 feet higher than Bampur and has quite a reasonable climate. During the first half of April 1912, heavy rain fell, and temperature was quite favourable for camp life in a single-fly tent. [Note by General SW?.—During March and April 1912, there was an un usually heavy rainfall in south-east Persia which, perhaps, ameliorated the local climate.] History.—Since 1909, the nominal authority of the Persians has declined In 1911, the Persians made an unsuccessful attack against the fort at Fehruj which had been captured by the Baluchis under Bahrain Khan of Sarbaz in 1908. After their repulse the Persians withdrew from Bampur altogether, and handed over the Bampur district to Sardar Saiyid Khan of Geh, who was appointed Deputy Governor of Persian Baluchistan. Sardar Saiyid Khan resides at Saiyidabad, 6 miles west of Bampur, having founded a new settlement there in 1910.—{Hopkins, 1912.) BAKU— A small hamlet near Rimdan, in Dashtiari. Mir Ahmad Khan lives here. He is a petty Sardar, about 50 years of age, and quite unsophisticated. He has about half-a-dozen armed foliowers.—( Hopkins, 1912.) BUKOH PASS— Elev. 4,863'. A pass at the head-waters of the Sarbaz river, on the road from Sarbaz to Bampur. There are several passes over this watershed. The Bukoh pass is one of the easiest, and is fit for wheeled artillery in its present condition. It is sometimes locally called the Tup Darreh, because a Persian force dragged wheeled artillery across it, when going from Bampur to attack Sarbaz. The summit of the Bukoh pass is approached by gradients of 1 1 (T on each side. The Bukoh kutal lies 3 miles north of the Mardukan kutal.The Mardukan pasa is very rough and difficult for laden camels. The Bukob pass route is 9 miles longer than that via the Kikam Pancbu pass. The Naushaman pass route is the shortest, but is very difficult. The Rigap pass is said to be easy, but is the longest detour of all. The Rigap pass lies on the direct route from Kahuri to IspatkI. The Bukoh pass is much better than the Bagani kutal (two marches north of Bahu Kalat) and with a little pioneer work, a good road, fit for wheeled transport could bo made along the mid beds. Floods would, of course, render such a road temporarily impassable. On the west side of the Bukoh pass, there is a kutal between two ndld beds, where, guns would have to be man-handled, but a very few hours’ work would make it easy. A pioneer battalion could mark out and clear an excellent road in two or three days. Some gun-cotton would be required, to make a good road over the last three miles from the summit on the eastern side. On the west ern side, about a mile from the summit, there is a sharp gradient for 60 feet. The foot track on the western side makes some short cuts, and the best route for wheels is away from the beaten track and following a ndld bed which leads into the bed of the Patki Kam—(Hopkins, 1912). c CHAH DAMDAM— On the road leading east from Duruh into Afghanistan.— (Consul, Slstdn, 1911.) CHAMP— Rustam Khan, a nephew of Saiyid Khan of Geb, is the Chief of Champ, together with the allied districts of Nukach and Ahuran. The whole is independent of Geb, and Rustam Khan will have no dealings with his uncle, because he thinks that Saiyid Khan should give him a personal allowance. The road from Qasrqand to Champ is controlled by Rustam Khan and with out his escort would not be open at the present time to any European. PIri of Gwash (q. v.) is one of his vassals, but is at present out of control. The hill-men, in this very mountainous district, are a very wild lot, but they are small and insignificant and with more bark than bite. They are well armed with Martinis, but are not formidable fighters. The tangi above Gwash, however, is a defile 10 miles long, where a force could easily be held up. Another'defile, 3 miles long, exists just below the junction of the Kaju and Ahuran rivers. Rustam Khali lives occasionally at Kishig, close to Geh. He appears to be about 32 years of age. He rides a good horse, but does not indulge in shooting. Ho has 3 children, the eldest being about 7. Two younger brothers live with him.— (Hopkins, 1912.) D DAF KAUR— A halting place on the Sarbaz river, 14 miles downstream from Sarbaz village, at the place where the Kishi Kaur joins the Sarbaz river. The4 DAL—GUS spelling Dap for Daf, on the map of the Route Book, is a mistake. A batta lion can camp in the bed of the Sarbaz river, but a larger force would have to camp in the valley of the Kishi Kaur, where ample space is available. Water good and abundant from the Sarbaz river. Fuel and grass are scarce. Camel-grazing available up the Kishi Kaur valley.— (Hopkins, 1912.) DALGAN— One stage from Dar-i-Ahii.— (Hedqes, 1911.) F FAHREH (or FEHRUJ)— Elev. 1,973'. The fort is in possession of Mir Bahram Khan of Sarbaz. The Killadar is Jaffir Khan, a relation of Bahram Khan, and a Baluch of good type. Fah- reh fort was captured in 1908 from the Persians by Bahram Khan, who gained possession by an artifice. The Persian garrison retired to Bampur, whence many deserted to their homes. In 1911, the Persians collected a force at Bampur, said to have been 5,000 strong, consisting of two battalions of regulars, one gun, and Baluch levies from Bampur and Rigan. They attacked Fahreh fort from the date grove on the south side, under the support of rifle fire and the fire of their gun. The Baluch levies were half-hearted and the local Baluchis were hostile. ! After losing 20 killed and wounded, the Persians fled to Bampfir. Saiyid Khan of Geh was at Bampur, and he saved the Persians from fur ther pursuit, and arranged their retreat to Kirman, the Persians losing many men en route from heat and from disease. As a reward, Saiyid Khan was appointed Deputy Governor of Persian Baluchistan, and was given the charge of Bampur and of the government laud, 6 miles west of Bampur. Saiyid Khan formed a new settlement in 1910, six miles west of Bampur, which is now called Saiyidabad. At Fahreh there are now no artificers. There is one bania. Fahreh is situated 150 feet higher than the village of Bampur, but scarce ly any higher than Bampur fort, which stands on a low hill. Fahreh is the more correct pronunciation of this place-name.— {Hopkins, 1912.) FlRUZABAD—(on the Sarbaz river). The fort belongs to ’Ali Muhammad, the brother of Mir Bahram Khan of Sarbaz. In March 1912, ’Ali Muhammad was being besieged in a fort in the Dizak valley, which he had recently captured, and Bahram Khan had marched from Sarbaz to his relief.— (Hopkins, 1912.) G GUSHAN— Elev. 3,900'. A halting place in the bed of the head-waters' of the Sarbaz river, 23 miles north-west of the village of Sarbaz. There are no habitations. Camping space is somewhat restricted. Sufficient for half a battalion in the river bed, but there are small sites available on the neighbouring easyi » GVA—KUL 5 hillsides. Water from a small spring, where the stream in the river bed runs dry in the hot weather. Fuel, camel-grazing, and grass abundant.— (Hopkins, 1912.) GVARPUSHT— Elev. 1,848'— The correct pronunciation is Gwarpusht. Good water from a small kdriz. There are 10 miles of drift sand south of Gwarpusht, 30 miles towards the south-west, and 7 miles towards the south east.— (Hopkins, 1912.) GWASH— Nine and a half miles north of Qasrqand. The abode of Pirl, a young Baluch, who has a considerable following, with whom he undertakes raids towards Mand and Dasht. Piri controls the Qasrqand tanqi. The chief of Champ finds him a considerable trial, but says he is too strong to be got rid of.— (Hopkins, 1912.) GWAT KASH KUTAL— A pass on the Bahu Kalat-Sarbaz road, 27 miles from Baha Kalat. The track over this kutal is a short-cut from Kahnan Kash to Kaptigin Dok or to Rask, but it is difficult for laden camels, especially on the south side. An easier route makes a detour towards the east, over the Bagani kutal (q.v.). -(Hopkins, 1912.) I ISFAKEH—Correct Elev. is 2,650'. This place belongs to Rustam Khan of Champ.— (Johns, 1912.) K KAHIRI-Elev. 4,100'. The correct spelling is Kahuri. It is the 3rd stage from Bampur towards Sarbaz, and 10 miles from Ab Savaran. The spring of water at Kahuri is said to be perennial. There is no such place-name in this neighbourhood as Pa Gudar, the halting place referred to is known as Patki Kaur. Patki Kaur is the name given to the main ndld which drains westward from the summit of the Mardukan kutal (q.'&gt;.). — (Hopkins, 1912.) KAPTIGIN DOK— Elev. 981'. A halting place on the Sarbaz river, 32 miles above Bahu Kalat. Ex tensive camping ground. Water, fuel, camel-grazing and grass all abund ant. No inhabitants. The villages of JakkI and Ziarat are about 2 miles up-stream.— (Hopkins, 1912.) kulani— The Kulani pass about 4,850 feet is a small kutal at the head of a minor tributary of the head-waters of the Sarbaz river. The Kulani ndld joins the Hasanuch a tributary of the Sarbaz river, at Kulari Daf, 191 miles north-west of Sarbaz village. There is a spring of perennial water at Kulani Daf. The Kulani pass is only fit for infantry.— (Hopkins, 1912.) ■j kV A L 6 MAR-SAI M MARDGIJ PASS— The northern exit from the Hasanuch valley towards Magas. It is evidently a narrow defile, as the natives said that one rifle could hold it.— (Hopkins, 1912, from native information.) MARDUKAN PASS— Elev. 4,826'. A pass over the watershed, on an alternative route between Sarbaz and Bampur. It lies 3 miles south of the Bukoh pass (qv.). The Mardukan pass is very rough and difficult for laden camels. Mardukan is the name given to a patch of cultivation, with a small grove of date palms, in the Hasanuch ndld, about 5 miles east of the summit of the Mardukan pass.— (Hopkins, 1912.) P PA GUDAR— Elev. 4,500'. There is no place in this locality known as Pa Gudar. This halting place is known as Patkl Kaur (vide Route No. 32 B., stage 15).— (Hopkins, 1912.) PAHNU— On the Makran coast, between Gabrln and Jagin.— IH. M S. “ Fox,' 1911.) PlRUD— Elev. 2,079'. There is no fort here. The place belongs to Mir Bahram Khan of Sar baz, and some armed ghuldms of his are in charge at Parud.— (Hopkins, 1912.) Q QASIMABAD—(9 miles west of Bampur)—Elev. 1,700'. RASK— Elev. 1,453'. The fort at Rask belongs to Mir Nawab Khan of Bahu Kalat.— (Hopkins, 1912.) RlGAP PASS— Said to be the easiest pass from Kahuri to Ispatki, on the Bampur-Sarbaz road, but 5 miles longer than the rute via Kikam Panchu.— (Hopkins, 1912, from native information.) s SAIYIDAbAD— Elev. 1,760'. Six miles west of Bampur. The official estate of the Persian deputy in charge of Bampur. Since 1910, Sardar Saiyid Khan of Geh has held the appoint ment of Deputy Governor of Persian Baluchistan, and resides at this place, which is now known as Saiyidabad. Saiyid Khan founded this new settle ment in 1910. There are only a few houses here, but a good deal of new irriga-7 SAI—SAR tion and cultivation. Sardar Saiyid Khan nominally controls the whole country from Bampur to the sea, but the local Baluch Sardars or Mirs are practically independent, and most of them refuse to pay any revenue. Saiyid Khan is about 45 or 50 years of age, and at his best is a man of adroit mind, but he is perpetually under the influence of opium, charas, etc., and suffers from headaches and toothache. He is terribly emaciated from his drug habits. His mother lives at Qasrqand. Saiyid Khan and his following seem a fairly respectable lot, and are much more civilised than the followers 1 of Bahram Khan of Sarbaz.— (Johns, Hopkins, 1912.) SAND— A small hamlet near Rimdan, in Dashtiari. Mir Ashraf ’Ali lives at Sand.— (Hopkins, 1912.) SARBlZ— Elev. 3,121'. SarbSz belongs to Mir Bahram Khan, Baranzai, who has his headquarters h SarbA 2 fort. - The fort was being repaired in March 1912, but the highest tower was still in a state of ruin. Bahram Khan’s three wives were living here, but he himself was absent, having gone to the Dizak valley with a lashkar of 80 men, to the relief of his brother ’Ali Muhammad, who was bes eged in a fort recently captured there by the two brothers. Sulaiman Khan, a nephew, was temporarily in charge of Sarbaz, with 20 men of a low type (probably ghulams), but well armed. Sulaiman Khan is a semi-Persianized Baluch, of poor physique, and With the appearance of bad character. Bahram Khan is spoken of as a bold, strong and brave leader by his men, but his villagers appear to be tired of the constant fighting involved in his excursions. °He is nominally the Deputy Governor of the Sarbaz district, under Saiyid Khan of Geh, the nominal Deputy Governor of Persian Balu chistan. 'Bahram Khan, however, is virtually independent and pays no re venue to Saiyid Khan.— (Hopkins, 1912.) / ✓ SARBAZ river— The mango, orange, and mulberry do not abound, but they are to be found. The main crops are wheat, rice, and broad beans. The water cannot be described as collecting in deep pools ; it runs continuously and is usually 10 to 20 feet wide, and 6 to 18 inches deep. If Were are occasional deep pools, it is not necessary to ride through them. [Note by General Staff.—This description applies correctly to the Sarbaz river be tween Sarbaz and Bahu K.alat only.] • / (Hopkins, 1912). G. M. Press, Simla.-No. C. 71 G. S.
