Dear Mr. Harrison, Thank you for your letter dated the 1st November (Ext.6576/46) regarding the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. I note what you say. I am corrmuni- eating your suggestion to both Companies and add' ing to each letter, the last paragraph of your letter to me. P.A.K.Harrison Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.Would &gt;ou kindly refer to your letter of 24th September regarding the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. Xou will remember that this subject was touched on by us when you called a few days ago to see Col. Hay at this Office. por the reasons which were mentioned, it would be rather difficult at the moment to come to any decision regarding permanent arrangements for the future and we would therefore suggest that the best thing would be for the Oil Companies to reach an early settlement with the Advisory Committee regarding contributions to cover past and present services, if this has not been already settled up, and that a decision regarding arrangements for the future should be left pending for the moment. I am not sure whether you would consider a round table meeting necessary simply for the purpose of settling past and present services, but if you would like us to put this suggestion to the Govtpnment of Inaia we should be quite willing to do so. I should add that we are, of course, ourselves most anxious that the lighting and buoying arrangements made with the Lighting service should be to the entire satisfaction of the Companies and that they should be satisfied that they are having an entirely fair deal and we should ourselves wish to do all we can to promote a satisfactory settlement to this end. tlA. &amp;.

LON D ON , E an ^ 24th September 1946, Persian Gulf Dear Mr. Harrison, Lij^h ting Service. I have received a copy of a letter dated July 30th, written by the Arabian American Oil Company, under the signature of Mr. W. Spurlock from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, to the President of that Company, Mr. Fred A.Davies, at 200 Bush Street, San Francisco. In this letter there is recorded the decision tT not to delay any longer payment of the bill '’rendered for maintenance of the Has Tanura beacons ”in 1945.” Tiiis decision appears to be subject to the approval of Mr. F. A. Davies. Seemingly, the amount is regarded as unreasonable, and it is hoped that the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Committee will accept the suggestion of Arabian American Oil Company that they meet and that ’’follow ing some such meeting ' the Company's Representatives in the Persian Gulf will be able to recommend to Mr. Davies some fair arrangement for the future. I might add the following sentence taken from the ]e tter - ^Incidentally if we are invited to 'attend a meeting of the Committee, and we have inX - 2 - that Bapco would also ^vi sh to send a Representative, we and Bapco should he on our way to permanent partici- ,? pation in their councils. u Upon receipt of this letter on the 9th September I wrote to the Arabian American Oil Company, 200 Bush Street, San Francisco in acknowledgment and advised that f, seeing that this matter v/as initiated by the India Office tf I have asked them If they see any objection to the suggest ion made by Mr. Spurlock that the outstanding questions be 'settled. If possible, at a round table conference with the ’’Persian Gulf Lighting Service. 1 * I would be glad If you would give the matter your consideration and let me have your views on the suggestion at your convenience. F.A.K.Harrison Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.♦i Copy of letter No.PA- 732, dated the 5th June, 1946, from the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited, Bahrain, to the political Agent, Bahrain. • 1 Referring to our conversation of yesterday morning, I enclose herewith a copy of a letter directed to N.O.I.C*, jufair, regarding the placing of a light on Shah Allum Shoal, which you will find of interest. This letter was sent on the understanding that this subject is under further discussion. Enclosure. BAPCO letter No. CON-589 dated 4.6.*46 to N.O.I.C., H.M.S. JUFAIR. in view of the recent grounding of the U.S.S.CACAPON on Shah Allum Shoal, it is understood that consideration is being given to moving the light presently located on Stiffe Bank to Shah Allum Shoal. This Company, as well as our friends the Arabian American Oil Company, has always considered that Shah Allum Shoal was a serious hazard to navigation particularly with respect to vessels proceeding to and from Arabian and Bahrein ports, and the mouth of the Gulf and that the Shoals should be lighted. This view is also taken by the majority of the Captains of ships calling at Bahrein whose opinions the Com pany has taken. With respect to the moving of the light from Stiffe Bank to Shah Allum Shoal, the Company does not wish to make a recommendation which could be interpreted that we wished to benefit the navigation to Bahrein and Arabia at the ex pense of the navigation to Northern Gulf ports and we leave the consideration of this point to the appropriate officials. However, the company does strongly recommend the moving of the light if it is considered that the moving of the light would not be detrimental to the navigation to Northern Gulf ports. In any event, the company strongly recommends that a light be installed at Shah Allum Shoal to mark this serious danger to navigation. s cci H.B.M. f s political Agent.

As to the letter dated 26th April 1946 to Arabian American Oil Company, a copy of which you send me with your letter under reply, I am writing on this to-day to S a n Francisco. I observe that the letter was directed to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. • iiv* I notice one curious thing, which is that, although the letters to both of these Companies are in line in regard to financial suggestions, the Bahrein I Company is asked to forego the principle they sought to I establish that they, as a Company, could, from time to f time make suggestions to the Persian Gulf Lighting Ser vice in regard to navigational aids in the Persian Gulf, f 1 think it is unlikely that the Companies will accept the suggestion of the .advisory Committee that the contribution towards general costs and expenses of tie Persian Gulf Lighting Service lights be left to the deter mination of the Advisory Committee. It seems, to me, radically to alter the principle underlying the offer. 2.P.Donaldson Lsq., C.M.G. India Office, S.W.l.? ' 1 334o 4 R f;le copy Gr4vernm0nt of. India.

Your offer of a contribution of £.500/- per annum from the 1st January 1942 towards the general coat and expenses of the F.n.L.3. li,ihts should in my opinion be regarded as provisional and subject to revi.jMi once in three years.

In regard to the proposal made by you in paragraph ’6 thereof, I may observe that these buoys belong to you and will remain your property during the operation of the proposed arrangement and thereafter. Hxe P.O.L.3. will only act as your agent and service the lights on the lines desired in paragraph 2 of your letter which sufficiently safeguard your interest. It does not therefore seem proper t;*at the Jerrlce should be ashed to replace those buoys free of charge should any of the contingencies mentioned by you arise. I, therefore, propose the deletion of paragraph 3 of your letter under reply from the proposed a^preement. 3. 1 may further add that your proposal to pay a fixed sum of £.500/- per annum in discharge of the cost and expenses incurred for servicing the above mentioned buoys was considered suitable as the average maintenance charges in respect of the lights were estimated not to exceed £.500/- per anuum, their average pre-war maintenance charges having been £.364/' per annum. But owing to the constant rise in the cost of material and labour the actual maintenance charges of these li hts amounted to £.1,309/- durinr the calendar year 1945 -vide , letter from the Director of ports and havigation, Basrah, to you No.1/14/4, dated the 6 th August 1945 (copy enclosed for ready reference). The proposal contribution of £.500/- per annum will t lie ref ore be far below the actual costs of their maintenance which also are likely to vary from year to year. 1 therefore, consider that the most reasonable course could be for you to pay from January 1943 onwards the actual expenditure incurred in servicing these lights. I trust that the above proposal will be acceptable to you. Please confirm. 4. Your offer for an annual contribution of £.500/- per annum from 1st January 1943 towards the general maintenance cost of ti a P.G.L.3. lights should in my opinion be regarded as provisional and subject to revision once in throe years.

( [ILF Try ■ The Persian G-ulf Lighting Service maintains injjbhe Persian Gulf and in the Gulf of Oman 3 lightships, 5 light houses and a large number of smaller lights, buoys and beacons some of which are in the territorial limits of Iran and Arab Chiefs* These lights were originally established by British efforts and were maintained by the B*I*S*N*Conxpary at their own expense. In 1908 however German Shipping Companies made overtures to co-operate in the Service* Thereupon the London Foreign Office suggested that these lights and buoys should be taken over at a valuation by the Government of India and that they should arrange for the maintenance of the Service, the cost being shared equally between British and Indian revenues* • This was agreed to and the Service oame under the control of the Government of India* In 1925 it was decided to run the Service on &amp; self-supporting basis and arrangements were made to levy light-dues on all shipping entering and leaving the ports of Basra and Abadan except those vessels exempted from the payment of the dues. The Port Director, Basra, was authorised to collect the light-dues levied under an Act of the Iraq Government on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, and His Majesty* s Government also agreed to pay a contribution in respect of Admiralty tankers visiting the Gulf* A Fund known as the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Fund was created to which all light-dues collected were credited and expend it ure on the maintenanoe and development of the Service was debited* The Fund was treated as a local fund and kept quite distinct from General Revenues of India* The actual a&amp;ninistration of the Service was carried out by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, till July, 1942 with the oV assistance of a non-official Advisory Comaittee of Shipping at Bombay and from that date the Nautical Adviser to the Government of India was entrusted with tbo above duties^and also appointed as Chairman of the Advisory Canmitteejji; In 1933 Iranian Government indicated that it w&amp;s their intention /to2 . to manage the lights and buoys on the Iranian coast themselves and a request was made to transfer to them all lights situated in their territorial limits. Negotiations in the matter wore started by His Majesty* s Covemaent and a draft protocol containing the terms and conditions of the transfer was drawn up and the following three points were also included therein for the acceptance of the Iranian Govemaentj- V (i) that they would consult the Bombay Lighting Advisory Committee of shipowners in matters concerning the administration of their lights; S V. (ii) that they would accept a lump sum payment on account of light-dues in respect of oilers belonging to His Majesty’s Government| and (iii) that they would not levy light-dues at a rate , greater than is necessary to cover the oosts of operating the lights in question. The negotiations for the conclusion of the protocol however ] b'A' came abruptly to an end in August 1937 when the Iranian Government intimated that they did not wish to purchase or hire any of the lights belonging to the. Persian Gulf Lighting Service and requested their immediate removal. As there was no choice but to accept the decision, it was agreed to remove the lights as and when the new installations of that Govarnuent were installed and found adequate. New lights were first set up by that Government in Kish and Bushire and. orders wore issued in 19¥) for the removal of the Persian Gulf lights at those places. Soon after however information was received that the lights were defective and giving trouble and orders were issued for the postponement of the removal of the P.G.L.3. lights but by that time the light at Kish had already been removed. In 1942 owing to scarcity of spare parts the light set up at Kish could no longer be operated with confidence and it was decided with the concurrence of the Iranian Government to close it down for the period of the war and a light vessel belonging to the Service was replaced. As however the light vessel needed extensive repairs due to her age, a proposal wasmnriA to the Iranian Government in May, 19M&gt; to remove her permanently and mount up the Kubhar Island beacon structure and apparatus in front of that Government light-tower on Kish Island. No reply to the proposal has yet been received. 2. India* s interest ** the £eiyi_qe. It is in the interests of Indian trade and British trade and trade generally that the administration of the lights is conducted from India as the Government of Ind ia possess better means of doing so than does the Iraq Govenraent. Otherwise India has no special interest in the Service. 3 . Comaercial interests in the navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab. Only three steamship lines from India serve the Persian Gulf, viz., the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Mogul Line and the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company. Besides the above quite a nucrber of oil tankers visit the Gulf for lifting oil owned by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, Kuwait Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions. These tankers visit only Bahrein a nd Ra s Tanura and contribute nothing for the upkeep oi the navigational aids maintained by the Service as they do not proceed to Basra or Abadan where light-dues are collected. As owing to certain political and administrative reasons light- dues cannot be levied at intermediate ports, i was suggested that the oil companies should be made responsible for the payment of the dues incurred by the tankers that call in return for the benefits conferred by the lighting %; ^ r, .ce and the last two companies should be asked to pay 66 of th e full dues. The first two oonpanies provisionally agreed to the proposal provided local Government had no objection but suggested that if they were to pay a contribution, the Persian Gulf Lighting Service should take over from them the maintenance as well as ownership of certain lights, buoys and beacons. The Bahrein Government had no objection to the proposal but the Saudi Arabian Government insisted that any- agreement relating to the servicing of the lights should he made between that Government and the Government of India* The last two companies viz* Kuwait Oil Company and the Petroleum Concessions however suspended their operations for the period of the war and it was decided not to approach them for any contribution for the present• The Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company also extinguished their operating any ships except small crafts involved in local traffic* So the question of recovering any contribution from them also was dropped for the time being. The Bahrein Petroleum Company however agreed to pay an annual contribution of £X}000 based on average tonnage of their ships entering the Gulf and the terms of an agreement to be entered into with them are at present under discussion between their representative and the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf* ) 'NAROTTAM'telephone: HOLBORN 8434. fe) The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, 1 94P Dear Lr.

If the foregoing is not clear, you have only to let me know. Should the balance arrived at be accepted by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service as correct, and they would let me know through you, the amount will be paid forthwith. In the meantime the Company vdll understand that as on and from the 1st January, 1946, the overall fee of £1,000 per annum will become payable, and vdll arrange for payment ac cordingly. My Company desire to make various suggestions which they believe to be of navigational interest and import ance to the Persian Gulf. I have suggested that these might well be made through their Nominee on the Committee, when that gentleman has been appointed. I trust you vdll agree with me that this would be the most logical and reasonable thing to do. F.A.K.Harrison Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.

Dear Mr. Harrison, I have received^ cop^g^fghe letyber addressed by the ai jian American Oil CompaMT tH'tiiB' 1 Gulf Lighting Hervice, under date the 17th April 1944 which (with a few change,s) follows the lines of the draft letter 9.1943 y&lt; ;A ' to be acceptable to the Government of In&lt; ■ou and I settled as likely .dia; a copy of the letter is enclosed. My instructions are to the effect that this letter ' of the 17th April 1944 is in a form which gives effect to the under standing come to between the Company and the Government of Saudi Arabia. No reply appears to have been received from the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. The reference to navigation beacons only in the first sent ence of paragraph one and in paragraph two of this letter o^ the 17th Ap-pil 1944 I am told, because the Ras Tanura channel markings are all beacons and no buoys are at present involved. The second sentence of the first paragraph is one affecting mly the navigation buoys etc. erected by the Corapany - presumably vithin or to the extent to which they are within the jurisdiction of the Saudi Arab Government. The third paragraph of the draft 3.9.1943 as to replacement of lost and damaged buoys and markers does not appear in this letter of 17th April 1944 because the Company regard the proposed arrangement as applying primarily to the servicing and maintenance of the Company^ beacons and they feel that, having erected the structures, they (the Company) are better able to do the work of major repairs and replace ments than the Lighting Service. The Company add that they expect the traffic into their area will be heavy and they would like to be in the position in the future to instal any additions or replacements at their sole discretion and without being obliged to consult the Lighting- 2 - 1 .Service except as modifications may be necessary in tbeir servicing arrangements. The third paragraph puts the commencement of the fixed annual payment for servicing beacon^at the 1st January 1944 - the reason for this is that/the period dealt with by the Saudi Arab Government and it is desirable tt—'- tie arrangement should not be retrospective from that Govern ment’s point of view. As a counter measure to give effect to the understood commencement of the total of £1,000 per annum, the voluntary contribution is taken back a year prior to 1 st January 1943 - see the fourth paragraph of the letter. The rest of the letter under review appears to be in accord with draft 3.9.1943. The Company state that they would like it to be understood that they are in a position at any time to suggest (presumably to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service and other Authorities concerned) additions or improvements in the aids existing in the Persian Gulf generally which may facilitate the passage of ships through the Persian Gulf to and from Has Tanura. I enclose an additional copy of this letter for the use of the Foreign Office. I also enclose a copy of a letter received by me from the Company, dated May 16th 1945. If you would like to see me on this matter, and will let me know, I will arrange an appointment mutually convenient. sincerel] F.A.K.Harrison Ssq., India Office, Whitehall, S.V/.l. Ends. Dely. MECa.

Ball an tyne Cliffords Inn Fleet Street, London, S.C.4. Dear Mr. Ballantyne : Je acknowledge with thanks your letter of the 12th of April. We hasten to explain that there was no intention on our part to alter in principle the original proposals regarding remuneration of the Lighting Service. As explained in previous correspondence, vie divided the payments into two parts merely for the purpose of clarify ing the position vis-a-vis the Saudi ^rab Government. They are con cerned with tte arrangement under which the Has Tanura beacons are ser viced but not with any payments which the Company may wish to make vol untarily as a contribution to the maintenance of Persian Gulf navigation aids as a whole, vte made the first part of the proposal effective January 1, 1944 to avoid complicating our position with the Saudi ^rab Government as they may have questioned an attempt to make the arrange ment retroactive before the year in which they gave their consent. Nevertheless, we made the other part retroactive to January 1, 1942, notwithstanding that there had been no shipping of any kind (except local traffic) in or out of Ras Tanura and very little shipping in other parts of the Gulf that benefited this Company during 1942 and 1943. We did not understand that there was any commitment, implied or otherwise, to make the proposed arrangements effective at any particular time, and there was certainly no intention on our part to make our payments any less than the Persian Gulf Lighting Service had any reason to expect fran us. ,/e note from the India Gffice letter, quoted in your letter of May 8, 1944, to Mr. Hanna that ’’the Government of India adds that the annual contribution of Ml,000 may commence from the first of January 1943.” ^ur proposal to the Lighting service calls for the same total payment as though both parts of the arrangement had been effective January 1, 1943. In our letter of March 14th, we mentioned that we had asked our Representative in Bombay to inquire what action was being taken on our pro posal. *ie quote below a telegram dated March 22nd, to ..r.Ohliger from Mr. Stein, which has been forwarded by mail to us but we have not as yet re ceived the actual letter of which it is a paraphrase.* / 5 beacons referred Director General Ports and Navigation Basrah for his opinion whether compatible with actual maintenance costs. Their proposed voluntary contribution Pounds 500 referred Government India for consideration unquote Stine” As we view the matter, we have made a proposal to the Lighting Service on which we are awaiting a reply. The proposal was made with the knowledge and consent of tte Saudi Arab Government. We are inclined to fear that matters might only be complicated if we should attempt to alter the proposal before the reaction of the Lighting Service is known, however, we want you to know that we wish to be on the generous side with the LightingService, rather than on the other side, and if there is anything about our proposal, particularly the pay ments, which they consider unsatisfactory or inadequate, we hope they will feel quite free to let us .know. Throughout the progress of this matter, we have been guided and are still being guided by the aim simply to arrive at some arrange ment that will be satisfactory to all concerned, and one with which the Persian Gulf Lighting Service will be quite happy. Since writing our letter of March 14th, we have received an actual copy of the letter which our Dhahran office addressed to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service on April 18, 1944. A copy is attached hereto for your record. Referring to the final paragraph of your letter, we have regarded our proposed arrangement with the Lighting Service as applying primarily to the ser vicing and maintenance of our beacon lights. The beacon structures were erected by the Company and if any major repairs or replacements should become necessary, we feel the Company would be better able to do this woik than the Lighting Service jJe expect that the traffic will be heavy into our area and would like to be in a position in the future to install any additions or replacements at our sole dis cretion, and without being obliged to consult the Lighting Service except as modi fications may be necessary in our servicing arrangements. should also like to be in a position at any time to suggest additions or improvements in the aids existing in the Persian Gulf generally, which may facilitate passage of ships through the Persian Gulf to and from Ras Tanura.

Dear Mr. Aar risen, I enclose the draft of a letter I have received from my Company in relation to the servicing of the Persian Gulf lighting and buoying. This draft is different in certain respects from the one which you and I discussed in September 1943, that draft being dated 3.9.1943. The first alteration is that to paragraph 1; this is purely verbal and needs no explanation. The Company have obviously desired to be a little more precise than we were. The last sentence to paragraph 3 is a new one specifi cally stating that the named buoys and any replacements in the Sitra Channel, are to remain the property of the Company. That, I suggest, is unobjectionable and is in accord with your understanding. Paragraph 4 is a new one altogether; it speaks for it self. I suggest that this is merely an expression of the freedora of suggestion existing as a matter of right in those who use the Persian Gulf clmnnels. If, however, you find any objection to it, my instruct ions are to delete it. Paragraph 5 is the fourth paragraph of the Draft 3.9.1943, slightly altered. My reading of this Clause, as altered, is that the Company may add to or subtract from the three buoys named in the letter. This could, of course, relate only to the Sitra Channel where there were fomerly six buoys, which six buoys were the subject matter of the fixed annual cost of £500. Therefore, there would appear to be nothing in this alteration. You will see that the Company have deleted altogether the 8th paragraph of Draft 3.9.1943. This relates to the removal of the lightship at Stiffs Bank, a matter which is one of general navigation rather than for the contribution to cost of navigation. I think you will find that the rest of the letter is on all fours with the Draft 3.9.1943. Jill you let me have, in due course, your views on the letter as now proposed? SECO. POL DEPT. 1 !

Company at their cam expense* In 1906 however German Shipping Companies made overtures to co-operate in the Hervice. Thereupon the London Foreigi Office suggested that these lights and buoys should be taken over at a valuation by the Government of India and that they sliould arrange for the maintenance of the Service, the cost being shared equally between British and Indian revenues* This was agreed to and the Service came under , the control of the Government of India* In 1925 it was decided to run the Service on a self-anipparting basis and arrangements were made to levy light-dues on all shipping entering and leaving the ports of Bast's and Abadan except those vessels exempted from the payment of the clues* The Port Director, Basra, was authorised to collect the li ht-dues levied under an Act of the Iraq Government- on behalf of His Majesty*3 Government and the Government of India, and His Majesty’s Government also agreed to pay a contribution in respect of Admiralty tankers visiting the Gulf* A Fund lonawn as the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Fund was created to which all light-dues collected were credited and expenditure on the maintenance and development of the Service was debited. The Fund was treated as a local fund and kept quite distinct from Genera^ Revenues of India. The actual administration of the Service was carried out by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, till July 1942 with the assistance of a norv-official Advisory Ca mittee of Shipping at Bombay and from that date the Nautical Adviser to the Government of India was entrusted with the above duties and also appointed as Chairman of the Advisory Conaittee. In 1933 the Iranian Govern;nent indicated that it was their intention to manage the limits and buoys on the Iranian coast themselves and a request was made to transfer to then all lights situated in their territorial limits. Negotiations in the matter were started by His Majesty’s Government and a draft protocol containing the terras and conditions of the transfer was drawn up and the following three points were also included therein for the acceptance of the Iranian Government (i) that they would consult the Bombay Lighting Advisory Committee of shipowners in matters concerning the administration of their lights; (il) that they would accept a lump sum pay .ent on account of light-dues in respect of oilers belonging to His Majesty’s Govern ent; and (iii) that they wotald not levy light-dues at a rate greater than is necessary to cover the costs of cr crating the lights in question* The negotiations for the conclusion of the protocol however came abruptly to an end in August 1937 when the Iranian Government intimated that they did not wish to purchase or hire any of the lights belonging » to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service and requested their immediate removal. As there was no choice but to accept the decision, it was agreed to remove the lights as and when the new installations oi that Government were installed and found adequate* Hew lights were xirst set up by that Government in Kish and Bushire and orders were issued in 1940 for the removal of the P rsian Gulf lights at those places. Soon after however information was received that the lights were defective and giving trouble and orders were issued for the postponement Ert.g?8M5 /*■ 4; $9warn of the removal of the P*G.L.S* limits but by that time the light at Kish had already been removed* In 194-2 owing to scarcity of spare parts the light set up at Kish could no longer be operated with confidence and it vms decided with the concurrence of the Iranian Government to close it down for the period of the war and a lightvessel belonging to the Service was replaced# As however the lightvessel needed extensive repairs due to her age, a proposal was made to the Iranian Government in May 1944 to remove her permanently and mount up the Kubbar Island beacon structure and apparatus in front of that Government li^it-to’-ver on Kish Island. No reply to the proposal has yet been received. 2* India’s interest in the Service * It is in the interests of Indian trade and British trade aid trade generally that the administration of the lights is conducted from India as the Grovernment of India possess better means of doing so than does the Iraq Government. Otherwise India has no special interest in the Service. 3* Coiimerical in terests in the r u l igation of the Sbat t—al—Arab* Only three steamship lines from India serve the Persian Gulf, viz., the British India Steam Navigation Cox%any, the Mogul Line and the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company. Besides the above quite a number of oil tankers visit the Gulf for lifting oil owned by the Bahrein Petroleum Compary, Californian Arabian Standard Oil Conpany, Kuwait Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions. These tankers visit only Bahrein and Has Tanura and contribute nothing for the upkeep of the navigational aids maintained by the Service as they do not proceed to Basra or Abadan where light-dues are collected. As owiAg to certain political and administrative reasons light-dues cannot be levied at intermediate ports, it was suggested that-the oil companies should be made responsible for the payment of the dues incurred by the tankers that call in return for the benefits coni erred by the lighting service and tlie last two companies should be asked to pay 66-2/3$ of the full dues. The first two cocTpanies provisionally agreed to the proposal provided local Government had no objection but suggested thaj^tj^ tfa y w ere to pay a contribution, the Persian Gulf Lighting Service should take over fron them the . r .iaintenance as well as ownership of certain lights, buoy- 6nd beacons. fhe Bahrein Government had no objection to the proposal but the Saudi Arabian Government insisted that aiy agreement relating to the servicing of the lights should be made between that Government and the Government of India. Tlie last two companies viz. Kuwait Oil Conpany and the Petroleum Concessions hewever suspended their alterations for the period of the war and it was decided not to approach them for ary contribution for the present. The Californian Arabian Standard Oil Cou^any also extinguished their operating ary ships except small crafts involved in local traffic. So the question of recovering ary contribution from them also was dropped for the time being. The Bahrein Petroleum Company however agreed to pay an annual contribution of £1,000 based on average tonnage of their ships entering the Gulf and the terms of an agreement to be entered into with them are at present under discussion between their representative and the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf.

Before I communicate further with the two Com panies, I would like to ask you whether you feel that the India Office would not raise any objection to a suggestion I might make to The Bahrein Petroleum Company, that if they are unwilling to accept the deletion of the condition that the lightship at Stiffs B a nk should be moved, their Harbour blaster at Bahrain, or other local Representative qualified to discuss these matters of navigation within the Persian Gulf, rniagit do so with a Representative of the Royal Indian Navy and thus solve, on the spot, any relative problem there might be. I assume that I would be correct in suggesting a Representative of the Royal Indian Navy, as being an Authority guiding both the Government of India and the Persian Gulf Lighting Service; IT not, perhaps youjwould be good enough to correct me in this. I propose to cable and write to both Companies direct in the United States of America by ordinary cable anu mail.

You may care to see the' attached Admiralty ch.-urt which shows both the Stiffe Bank and the Shat^llum Shoal to which the Bahrain petroleum Company want to move the lightsliip. There is a certain amount of correspondence on the subject in the attached volume (Collection 30/49&gt; Part II) which it is not really necesscory for you to read. The main point is that the Stiffe Bank lightship appeal’s to be one of the chain of lights used by The lightship and lighthouse at Kais Island also come into the picture. I gather that one of the chief reasons for having a light ship at Stiffe Bank was that one could not rely on the lighthouse at Kais Island which was operated by the Persians. .There now, however, seems to be a lightship ther^ as well. However, I do not think we need enter into the technical details further since presumably the Persian Gulf lighting Service are the real authorities on the subject.

For example, you will see that in the seocnd para graph I refer to a period which, having regard to paragraph 5 might be said to commence 1st January 1942; I also visualise the servicing of the buoys con cerned during the whole of that period and continuously in the future, although I understand th»t the buoys have not been serviced, for some time at any rate, and they are not at present being serviced. Both parties may like to make the paragraph a little more precise. As a lawyer, I am tempted to lean towards precision. I have, however, borne in mind what no doubt the Company will bear in mind - that is, that this is an informal record of an arrangement between two parties, which can be terminated by either party on six Booths' notice ex- iring at the end of any year. An additional oo» fort to me lies in the prac tical safeguard to the company afforded by their power to nominate a representa tive on the Committee. I believe that so far as is known here, the Persian Gulf light ing service has not yet agreed that either your Company or The Bahrein Petroleum Co., Ltd., should be represented on its Advisory Committee. The Indie Cffice have no reason to believe that tie Committee will take exception to this part of the proposals. My recollection is that you do not feel you vill have any uiificulty in this respect. I mention the matter, however, in order to avoid any misunderstanding. In visualising the Persian Gulf Lighting service, I define it as 'A body of persons interested in the navigation of the Persian Gulf under the general control of the Government of India, all parties concerned contributing something to the common end.' This is something different frcra a Government Committee pure and simple. The Committee includes among its members, several representatives of Producing and Shipping Interests. Tills definition is one, I believe, with which neither the India Cffice nor B.m.F oreign Office would be inclined to disagree.THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM CCMPANY LIMITED u -'S CLIFFORDS INN FLEET STREET LONDON E.C.4. 3rd 3epte&lt; ber. | 8 ) 1943.

You ask, however, whether t , I ’’consider the draft agreements satisfactory from the legal standpoint”, and ,if this means that these drafts are intended to constitute definite offers which on acceptance are to become enforceable contracts, I am not sure that the wording of paragraph 5 S' is in every way appropriate. I realise that a distinction can properly be drawn between the services specified in paragraphs 2 , 3 and 4 and those specified in paragraph but is there any real reason for the emphasis laid on the voluntary nature of the payment to be made for the services to be rendered under paragraph 3* Every offer, of course, is in the first instance voluntarily made but there is an essential difference between a voluntary contribution towards expenses that will in any event be incurred - which is perhaps the position here? - and a payment offered in consideration of expenditure (or an increase of expenditure) to be incurred on the strength of the offer. The latter on acceptance would be binding; the former would not as there would be no consideration to support it. If therefore,it is intended that the companies should become bound to 'pay the ,£500 mentioned in paragraph 5,1 should prefer to see some such wording as ”in consideration of the provision and maintenance by you of general aids to navigation etc...we agree to pay you etc”.

I think that what hesitation there has been on the part of the Saudi Arab Government in this case may have arisen from an incorrect understanding of the con stitution and functions of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. It seems to have been explained to them that Officially this is a body controlled*°and representative of the Government of India, rather than that it is a body of persons interested in the navigation of the Persian Gulf, assisted by the Government of India, all parties concerned contributing something to the common end. If I am incorrect in any par ticular in so describing the Persian Gulf Lighting Service will you please correct me because I want to make it quite clear to Lr. Ohliger what the Persian Gulf Light ing Service is. The fact that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company are to be able to nominate a representative to the Committee by virtue of the fact that they contribute generally to the expenses of servicing the Persian Gulf, well illustrates the point I would like to make to Lr. Ohliger. If any point or objection occurs to you, would you let me know as soon as you can do so conveniently? I will come and see you on the letter, or we can discuss it by telephone, whichever is most convenient to you. E.W.R.Lumby Ssq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Ends.

Dear Mr. Lumby, I send herewith copy of a letter which I suggest this Company might write to the Persian Gulf Lighting Ser vice in relation to the maintenance of the buoys in the Sitra Channel, and aids generally to navigation in the Per sian Gulf. You will see I have made this conform to the letter I am sending you to-day to cover the similar arrange ment between the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. This is not ^uite in accordance with my instructions but I see no objection to it and it mi$it help the California Arabian Company if they are able to say to the Saudi Arab Government that the arrange ment follows the line of that between this Company and the Lighting Service. You will note, for consideration, that the power to terminate extends to both parties and that it can deal with el ther or both the servicing of the channel lights or the contribution towards general navigation. This, I think, is essential in the case of the California Arabian Company for reasons you will appreciate. E.tf.R.Lumby Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Enel.

Dear Sir: ,yo i4« This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for your letter of the 22nd of June, regarding our contributions to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. &lt; On approximately the same date your letter was received, we received a message from Mr, P. tv. Ohliger, our General Manager in Saudi Arabia, that Mr. Garry Owen was advised by Yusuf Yasin to expect a letter from the SAG suggesting that the Company draft a letter for the lighting service, setting out our understanding regarding the servic ing of lights and payments. The Company is to submit a proposed letter to the SAG for approval and will receive formal approval from the Govern ment before the arrangement is finalized. Mr. Ohliger states he can see no objections to this and recommends that you draft a brief and simple letter covering the points discussed in our letter of December 30th to you, airmailing copies of this draft to him and to me. He believes the letter should specifically set forth the agreed arrangements regarding servicing of our lights and the amount of payment for this service - this letter to be along the lines suggested in our letter last winter to you. Mr.Ohliger believes it is desirable also to add a para graph indicating our willingness to pay a blanket amount as a voluntary contribution from the Company toward defraying out-of-pocket cost of the lighting service in maintaining other aids to navigation in the Persian Gulf from which the Company receives direct or indirect benefit. He states the SAG already knows we expect to make such a contribution, and /*]/£. ^ ^ e Ji 9Ves it i s best to conceal no facts as long as the contribution ft - B 7 0 ary and made to defray actual cost rather than to afford profit ki*&gt;&lt; | to lighting service.

Position is that dues covering lights throughout Persian Gulf are collected on arrival of ships at Basra, but as ships serving B.P.C. and C.A.S.O.C. do not go to Basra these Companies have hitherto made no contribution towards lighting services. Agreement providing for lump sum contribution by B.P.C. to P.G.L.S. is at present under negotiation, and proposals have been put forv/ard for similar agreement with C.A.S.O.C. This would provide that P.G.L.S. should undertake to service C.A.S.O.C's lights in approaches to Ras Tanura in return for annual payment by the Company which would cover cost of this service, as well as Company’s share of cost of upkeep of Gulf lights generally. It is not clear why Saudi Arabian Government think it necessary that such an agree ment should be negotiated,by them, any more than any other commercial contract into which the Company may enter, since the Government are not presumably prepared to bear the cost of the contribution. 2 # The servicing of the Company^ lights at Ras Tanura by P.G.L.S. is only one part of the services which the proposed contribution is intended to cover; but if the Saudi Arabian Government copsider that their permission is necessary before the P.G.L.S. can work in Saudi territorial waters, I suggest that this permission be given by a letter formally authorising the Company to make arrangements for this purpose with the P.G.L.S. 3. You should explain matter to Saudi Arabian Government on these lines and say that I trust that in the circumstances the Saudi Arabian Government will now authorise Company to proceed with negotiations for the agreement. If you think it desirable, you may add an assurance that these arrangements (which do not involve any change in the ownership of the lights concerned) would in no way prejudice any decision regarding sovereignty over certain reefs about which there has been dispute in the past (see correspondence ending with your telegram No. 352 of 1941). . 4. For your own information, the Company have in the past employed the P.G.L.S. to maintain the Ras Tanura lights, but ceased /doing so in October 1941 for fear of incurring the displeasure.of the Saudi Arabian Government, They would prefer that no mention of this should be made to Saudi authorities, -'by the Bahrein Petroleum Company) covering (a) their contribution to the upkeep of the Gulf lights generally; and (b) the cost of servicing their own lights at the approaches to Has Tanura. (These lights would remain the property of the Company). 3. With regard to (b), the Company have in the past employed the Lighting Service to look after their lights. In 1941 however the Saudi Government, who had never been informed,of this arrangement, began to make enquiries; and for fear of incurring their displeasure, the Company have dispensed with the servicing of the Ras Tanura lights since October of that Co*\ i year. This increases their/anxiety that the Saudi Government should be reassured that/that s will in no way he infringed by the arrangements made with the Lighting Service. I may add that, according to Ballantyne . deprecate the mention in any official communication to r the Saudi Government of the.fact that the Lighting Service have ever had the care of these lights. 4. The nervousness shown by the Saudi^s over this matter seems to arise from the fear that the activities of the Lighting Service may affect their territorial water rights. I understand that infect only one of the beacons concerned is within three miles of the Arabian Coast. But in that area the question of territorial waters is of course complicated by a number of reefs of doubtful ownership. One of the Has Tanura lights is in fact situated on Fasht Bu Saafa, which figured in some correspondence we had with you in 1941 (see your letter to Peel No.E 7893/ 1505/91 of December 4th of that year). You/You will remerriber that the Bahrein Petroleum Company were authorised to drill on this reef on the understanding that they would suspend operations if the Saudi Government raised any objection.. In the event the Saudi^s did object, and the Company accordingly withdrew. It seems very desirable that the question of the Has Tanura beacons should if possible be kept separate from that of the respective territorial water rights of Saudi Arabia and Bahrein. 5. If you agree that there is a ca^se for seeking to reassure the Saudi Government through His Majesty*s Minister, I tentatively suggest that he should make a communication to them on the following lines:- the C.A.S.O.C. is anxious to make arrangements for the maintenance of its lights in the approaches to Has. ^anura, and for this purpose it has been in negotiation with the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. The arrangements proposed will simply provide for the upkeep of/The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited. Cliffords Inn, Fleet Street, London, E.C. 4. \ 23rd February 1943. Dear Peel, l Persian Gulf Lighting service I yesterday received a letter from the California .Arabian Standard Oil Company regarding the servicing of the Ras Tanurah beacons. The position does not seem to be a very easy one. Perhaps I had better come and see you one day when you have half an hour to spare? i*e might arrange something by telephone. Yours sincerely, R»T # Peel -^*s£i»&gt; C.B.m., L.»C., India Office, fthit ehal1, S .ft.1.5 ./ Mr. . Peel. t/ D. U- / . '/iV.tfa,. You will remember that the .problem is to secure. that some contribution to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service is paid in respect of shipping which does not go so far up the Gulf as Basra, where alone the light dues are collected. Shipping in this category is apparently confined almost entirely to the tankers which visit only Bahrein or Has Tanura. 2. Your letter No.PZ.586/41 dated July 2nd put to Mr. Ballantyne the proposal of the Government of India and the Political -Resident that the Bahrein Petroleun , . Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company should make a periodic contribution to the funds of the Lighting Service, based on the tonnage of the shipping entering the Gulf and proceeding only to Bahrein or Has Tanura on business connected with the Companies* operations. This contribution would be calculated at 2/j&gt; the rate of the dues levied at Basra. 3* The proposal,as received from India, envisaged contributions by the Kuwait Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. , as well as by the two Companies mentioned above. For the reasons given in my note of 18th September, 1941 , we did not proceed with this part of the proposal. 4* Our letter No.Ext. 7993/41 of December 16th, 1941 &gt; informed the Government of India that Mr. Ballantyne had told us that the two Companies were prepared to agree in principle to contribute towards the Lighting Service, but were inclined to prefer a fixed annual contribution to one based on tonnage. They had also suggested that,if they were to make a contribution towards the Service, the latter should take over from them the maintenance of the lights at Sitrah and Has Tanura (should, in other words, refrain from sending in bills to the Companies in respect of the maintenance of these lights, a task which is already being undertaken by the Service). Our letter concluded with a reference to information received from Mr.Ballantyne that some question relating to the Sitrah lights had been referred by the Bahrein Petroleum Company to the Political Agent at Bahrein and by him to the Government of India.5. The papers at Ext* 1548/42 shew that the Bahreim Government would have no objection to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service taking over the responsibility for maintaining and, if necessary, the ownership, of the Sitrah lights* 6 * The whole question was complicated and delayed by the intervention of the Saudi Arabian Government, who claimed that the agreement for the. servicing of the Has Tanura lights should be made, not between the C*A*S*0*C* and the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, but between themselves and the Government of India (see Jedda telegram No. 186 of June 9th). After obtaining the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident we discussed the whole question with Mr. oBallantyne at the end of August. You then suggested as a possible solution that the C.A^S.0.C. should make no specific contribution to the Lighting Service, but that to compensate the latter for this the Bahrein Petroleum Company should pay them a larger contribution . than they otherwise would do. Mr. Ballantyne' s letter below shows that the Bahrein Petroleum Company do not agree to this suggestion# The letter also shews that^ discussions at Jedda between the eoiupaiyls representative o^ and the Saudi Government have so far come to nothing, Ikit Mr. Ballantyne holds out the prospect of a further communication on the mainland aspect of the question, and meanwhile he proposes that we should proceed with the negotiations for a contribution to the Service by the Bahrein Petroleum Company only. The agreement outlined in his letter seems to provide a reasonable basis on which we can go to the Government of India. A draft letter for this purpose follows, together with an acknowledgnent to Mr. Ballantyne. (I have already acknowledged his letter orally). •' H i. .— wammem wm DRAFT LETTER Secretary to the Government of India, Commerce Department* FAST AIR MAIL 1 Copy to:- F.O. ) With Admiralty) ^enclosure and Commerce Dept.* s letter dated .

Progress in this matter has been delayed by the claim of the Saudi Arabian Government that any agreement relating to the servicing of the lights at Ras Tanura owned by the C.A.S.O v C. should be male, not between that Company and the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, but between the Governments of Saudi Arabia and India ( see correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India, External Affairs Department, No.6530 of August 19th 1942). On the receipt of that telegram the matter was discussed with Mr. Ball ant yne ) whp represents/represents both the Companies in London# It was suggested to him 9 as a possible solution of the difficulties which had arisen with the Saudi AraMatvCoverament, that the C#A#S#0#C# should make no specific contribution to the Lighting Service, but that instead the contribution to be paid by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, who are in very close relations with the Company operating on the mainland, should be correspondingly increased. A letter, a copy of which is enclosed, has » now been received from Mr# Ballantyne, which states that the Bahrein Petroleum Company cannot see their way to give effect to this suggestion# This letter also shows that the C#A#S#O.C# have not yet reached agreement with the Saudi Arabia*Government regarding the proposed arrangement relating to the payment of a contribution by the Company to the Lighting Service; and that a further conununication on this aspect of the matter may be expected# 3# The Bahrein Petroleum Comp any ^ for theirmaam their part, are willing to proceed with negotiations for an agreement under which they would undertake to pay an annual contribution to the Lighting Service; and they hacve put # forward proposals to this end* I am to enquire whether the Government of India ana the Persian Gulf Lighting Service are prepared to agree to these proposals, as set out in Mr* Ballantyne's letter) and if so, from what date they would wish them to come into effect* 4* With regard to the enquiry at the end of your letter, I am to explain that on receipt of your letter of the 11th October, 1940, it was decided to approach in the first place only those Ccmpanies whose operations were sufficiently advanced to enable them to export oil, viz.^Bahrein considered hardly Justifiable to ask Companies who were not yet in a position to export oil to make Jjl, contributions in respect of dues* Since that time the Koweit Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions Ltd* ^ have both suspended their/\ their operations in the Gulf for the duration of the war; and this makes it still less * 1 ' ^ ^ ^ «i. appropriate to approach them in this matter* 5* A copy of this letter is being sent to . the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent at Bahrein* (Sgd.)

Yesterday morning I received from my people in New York the letter referred to in their cable to me, an extract from v/hich I sent to you in my letter of the 10 th December. It appears that Mr. Roy Lebkicher was unable to get the Government of Saudi-Arabia to agree to permit his Company, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company Limited, to vary the manner of that Company^ contributions toward the general cost of lighting ana generally servicing the Persian Gulf, that Government taking the stand that any arrangement for the Persian Gulf Lighting Service to enter Arabian territorial waters to service the lights in Ras i'anura Channel is a matter that should be arranged between the Saudi-Arabian Government and the Government of India. I am told^^hat either Mr. Fred A. Davies or Mr. Roy Lebkicher wilf^ or as I hope, has written, to me more fully on this subject. In regard to the Bahrein Company I am instructed to say to you that they are willing to go through with the original negotiations so far as they are concerned, that is to say, as follows d) ( 2 ) The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited to con tribute to the Fund of the Gulf Lighting Service the sum of £1,000 Sterling annually. Contributions to start as on January 1st, 1942, or January 1st, 1943, as the India Office or the Government of India desire. Should the commence ment date be January 1st, 1942, then there would P.T.C.of course be adjustment for payment already made for the year 1942. ( 3 ) V Ihe Company to have a Representative on the Committee of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service; such Representative to,be nominated and removed by. them, from time to time on no tice in writing^Tb Tfte 3iairman of such Committee. (4) The Persian Gulf Lighting Service to replace without cost to the Company any buoys or channel markers which might be or might have been lost or became for any reason whatsoever unfit or undesirable for further service during the period of operation of this Agreement. (5) The Persian Gulf Lighting Service adequately to repair and to maintain the light and dumb buoys in an efficient state for the purposes they are intended to serve. (6) The lightship now located at Stiffe Bank immediately be removed westward 34 miles to Shah Allum Shoal, such removal to be notified to the Company at Bahrain and London directly the removal is effected. (7) The Agreement outlined in this and the fore going six Clauses to be terminated on not less than six calendar months’ notice expiring at the end of any calendar year, by the Company giving v/ritten notice to the Chairman for the time being of the Committee of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. My Company regret that in the circumstances they cannot see their way to give effect to a suggestion I had put to them that they should pay something additional to the £1,000, per annum to assist the Government of India in the loss of a payment of a like sum by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company Limited. I hope that before very long the way will be cleared for the payment by that Company directly of such a sum or something equivalent to it. I am hoping to hear shortly from Mr.Davies or Mr. Lebkicher on the matter of the Mainland. Directly I do so, I will communicate with you further.In the meantime would you he good enough to let me know as soon as you possibly can whether the arrangement out lined above meets with your approval.

In other words, for the purpose of servicing the Gulf, we take the Gulf as a whole and assume that the Channels to Sitra and Ras Tanurah are part of the general navigation of thd Gdlf. These Channels are not like bays or other municipal waters of a particular State; they are part of the waters traversed generally by shipping and shipping needs may demand. I could appreciate the difficulty which the Saudi Arab Government see if the‘servicing were confined to the Channels buoyed by the two Companies with which we are concerned. As It is, I fail to see how either in principle or otherwise, the Saudi Arab Govern ment would be giving anything away by raising no objection to the Company making this Voluntary contribution to the general jfixpenses incurred by a neighbouring State in helping in naviga tion as a whole over what are definitely troublesome v/aters. The alternative, of course, would be for the Saudi Arab Govern ment to make the contribution themselves, but that, I assume is.not to be thought of.* I have.

That, in turn, might, I suppose, give rise to the question - What is the extent of those waters? I gather there might be one light within them. My Companies are still willing to make their contributions al- ; t ough a question has been raised as to how far these will go to cover re- irs to the lights and b hoy s and cost of replacement. There has also been before me for some weeks now, the question of moving the lightship now located at Stiffs Bank westward 34 miles to Shah Allum Shoal. Apparently this light has been installed during the last two years and marks no hazard but is of some service to vessels com ing from narthemGulf ports. If it is installed at the new location I am told it would be equally serviceable to those coming from the north and at the same time it would be of unestlmable value to vessels coming from the Bahrain vicinity. Apparently Masters of ships all give the Shah Allum Shoal a wide berth resulting in finding themselves at times in unenviable locations. R.T.Peel Ssq., C.B.E., L.C., India Cffice, Whitehall, S.W.l.

As you v/ill remember, these papers deal v/ith the question of inducing the various oil companies on the Arab shore of the Gulf to make a contribution to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. was arguable whether, and if so to what extent, it would be necessary to bring into the picture the Shaikhs and the Saudi .Arabian Government (see paragraph 7 of Colonel Prior*s letter of April 12, 1940, and Mr. Gibson's marginal notej. So long as it was simply a matter of securing from the oil companies payment for an existing conmercial (but not-profit-making) service, it could be contended that none of the Governments was concerned. But the oil companies have now complicated matters by stipulating that, if they are to pay a contribution, the Persian Gulf Lighting Service should take over the^tae-fr of maintaining the lights at Sitra and Has Tanura. The Bahrein Government has told the Bahrain Petroleum Company, through the Political Agent, that it has no objection to this arrangement in the case of the Sitra lights (Axt. 1548/42). It seems (and Mr, Syres is inclined to agree) that the Saudis are equally entitled to be consulted before a\ concern controlled by the Government ^^5-.

The Political Agent might easily, as a result of this practice, be put in a most embarrassing position. 3* I have now arranged that in future, when the Company write to me on matters in which the Bahrain Government are interested, they will, instead of sending a copy to Belgrave, send an additional copy to me which I will use or n&lt;t&gt;t, as I think fit, in addressing the Bahrain Government. Yours sincerely, sd .E,B.Wakefield• The Hon’ble Lieut.-Colonel Vi'•R.Hay*CIE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2./- Copy of letter No. PA-822 dated the 29th November 1941 from the Chief Local Representative, Th? Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. e are in receipt of a communication from our Principals in New v 0 rk stating that considerable corres pondence has been carriod on between the India Office in London, through our Company representative, Mr. Ballantyne, in London, and themselves, regarding the maintenance of certain navigational aids in the Persian Gulf; and more psirticularly those owned by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, which are of special assistance to vessels visiting Sitra Basin. In order to refresh your memory on tiis matter, it might be recalled that when the oilloading terminal at Sitra was first placed in service, no vessels of de«p draft ever visited Sitra Basin; but the Bahrain Light Vessel, the 'North Sitra Buoy', and other navigational aids leading in to Manama ware already in place. In order to faciliuate the passage of vessels to the new port of Sitra, the Bahrain Petroleum Company, at considerable expense, negotiated with H.B.M&amp;a Government and through them, purchased and installed J .10 buoys officially known as 'Middle Sitra Buoy' and 'South Sitra Buoy'. We are enclosing herewith a plan showing the location of these buoys (navigational aids) involved in the matter. It was agreed at that time that the expense involved in maintaining these buoys should be borne by the Company, but the labour and material in connection with this maintenance was to be furnished by the Basrah Port Trust using the Light House Tender 'Nearchus' for this purpose. In addition to the buoys mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the Bahrain Petroleum Company have also installed certain buoys of various types within the immediate area of Sfttra Basin, which are used for various purposes and are maintained by Bapco. These markers and buoys are not to be considered in any way in the present discussion. Our communication from New v ork outlines a plan for contributing to the Indian Government*a Persian Gulf Lighting Service annually, rather than paying the varying amounts charged oy the Basrah Port Trust. However, before tsg may formulate a reply to our principals in this matter, it is most desirable that we have specific information from you on the following questions : 1. Is there any objection by the local Government siiould the Persian Gulf Lighting Service maintain the lights now owned by the Bahrain Petroleum Company in the territorial waters of Bahrain and/or adjacent thereto ?2. Is there any local objection if the responsibility for the /maintenance of the b uoy (now owned and operated by the Bahrain Petroleum Company) should be transferred to the Persian Gulf Lighting Ser vice ? Is there any objection, in case such a step should be found advisable, to also transfer the ownership of these navigational aids to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, by sale or other wise ? We are asked by our Principals to hasten our reply on this subject, and for this reason would deeply apprediate your early answer• 0O0 Copy of demi-official letter No. C/1147 dated the 10th December 1941 from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.

The Company wish to know whether there is likely to be any objection on the part of the State to such transference and maintenance. 3. With the exception of the Company*s lights, buoys and other navigational aids, I think I am right in saying that all other navigational aids affecting Bahrain are owned and maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. The nearest of these is the red flashing light on Has Zarwan, which is only about 2 miles from the Manama Customs pier. 4. I cannot find any reference either to ot* from the State on the subject of these lights, but understand that the Port Officer was aware of the arrangements. Presumably therefore there would be no objection to the Middle and South Sitra buoys being similarly owned and maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, and I would be glad of your confirmation of this.3 - Copy of demi-official letter No. 2401-3F dated the 11th December 1941 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. .Vith reference to your D.O.

Because of T 'the portion of Gulf facilities used by vessels pro ceeding to Bahrein and Ras Tanura, and that it was necessary that both the subject comoanies provide their own ports, we do not feel that a rate based on port charges at other locations in the Gulf, where developed ports were nnde available, would provide an equit able basis They ask addressees to put this to the India Office. /If Operating Unit Section Examiner D.A.C Datef, &gt; i - noiaeiMaua .aiHaaoenao HaAfloajHT &amp; ja aoa 1 • • .D.S If they do make these contributions they will expect to be relieved of maintenance expense for oitrah and Kas fanura channel buoys.

RECd.POU.OEPt. 30 JA.U 9*1 INDIA OFFICECopy of demi-official letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.158-3, dated the 12th April 1940. Subject:- Levy of Light Dues at Bahrain. Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with India Office letter No.P.Z.3718/39, dated the 1st February 1940, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Commerce? 2. It has been agreed long ago that the best solution, at any rate in theory, is that the Bahrain Petroleum Company should be asked to make an annual lump sum contribution towards the cost of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service (Walton*s demi-official letter No.P.Z.5069/36, dated the 20th July 1936), and these proposals have recently been in abeyance owing to the fact that (a) it was found that the Bahrain Petroleum Company controlled none of the tankers that visit Bahrain, and (b) that there was thought to be a risk of encouraging the rise of a rival port at Ras Tanurah. We need not worry any further about the danger of the creation of a rival port at Ras Tanurah - it has been created - and nothing we can now do will stop its growth. This view has been accepted by the India Office in their letter No.P.Z.8109/38, dated the 10th March 1939, a copy of which was forwarded to India under their Printed Letter N 0 . P.Z.8109/39, dated the 14th March 1939. 3. The Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Committee have recently returned to the charge, and demanded that all vessels using the Persian Gulf lights should pay light dues, irrespective of the port in the Persian Gulf to which they are proceeding (reference papers forwarded with your endorsement No.D.4396-N/38, dated the 16th December 1938). This attitudeis perfectly reasonable since at the present moment the British I^dia, (who have, of course, instigated this claim), are paying Persian Gulf Lighting dues on every one of their steamers that visits Bahrain, whereas a very large numbift of tankers with a far greater tonnage escape scot-free. The only question before us, then, is how to compel the Bahrain Petroleum Company to pay lighting and buoying dues, and equally, (since we cannot equitably oblige them to pay without levying a similar toll from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company), how to secure similar payments by tankers of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company using the port of Has Tanurah. 4. It has been estimated (India Office demi-official etter No.P.Z.6153/37, dated the 21st September 1937) that assuming the average Bahrain Petroleum Company's tonnage per year at Bahrain to be 255,000 tons, the annual sum to be contributed by them would be in the neighbourhood of £800 . Presumably the India Office took into account Baggallay's demi-official letter No.E.5298/111/34, dated the 15th September 1937, forwarded with the above letter, in which Ward agreed to a lighting and buoying rate equivalent to 66f% of the standard rate charged at Basra. 5. As you are aware the Bahrain Petroleum Company have installed (vide India Office Printed Letter No.P.Z.3635/34, dated the 8th June 1934, and connected correspondence) detain lights and buoys at Bahrain through the agency of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service and they paid them for the work done and also pay them an annual sum, believed in the case of the Bahrain Company to be £280 per annum, for their upkeep. I n the case of California Arabian Standard Oil Company, certain buoys were to be provided, but in the end light beacons were erected by the Oil Company themselves (vide India Office Printed Letter No.P.Z.7192/39, dated the 17th November 1939), and the lights are gerviced by the Persian Gulf LightingIt -3- , , ll0 P « ^ Service under the terms of a special contract of which we have no record. The Persian Gulf Lighting Service are not, so far as I am aware, committed to serving the private buoys and beacons for either Company for any fixed period and the arrangement can be terminated at will. 6. It will be seen that the two Oil Companies are already paying considerable sums for certain special lights and buoys, but that they escape payment for the main Gulf lights, or Route Lights as they are usually called, e.g. Quoin, Tamb, Farur, etc., and this position is obviously inequitable. In addition to these lights, which were already in existence, the Persian Gulf Lighting Service undertook certain extra lighting after the Bahrain Oil Company commenced operations at Bahrain (vide Government of India Express Letter No. F.17-N/33, dated the 7th September 1934, to the India Office, and connected correspondence), and installed a light vessel which was costly to buy and expensive to maintain. This light vessel, which is about thirty miles from Manama, the port of Bahrain, enables a vessel to obtails^ its exact position whilst still far from shoal water, and without it, the tankers of both the Oil Companies, which come from all parts of the world and are unfamiliar with the Gulf, would have great difficulty in making the port. The tankers chartered for the oil of the Bahrain Petroleum Company naturally have to make the Bahrain light vessel, but it is obvious that it is equally essential for the California Arabian Standard Oil Company tankers bound for Ras Tanurah to make this light before proceeding there, since tk^re ^is at least one three fathom patch (Bu Athana) dangerously near their course before they can pick up the first (No.l) of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company 1 s light beacons which lead round the reefs to Ras Tanurah, namely that on the Rennie Shoal in Lat.27 o 00'40' North Long.50°41’25' East.km. f 1 acr.ci A^e U&gt;\U4 L*, flu oLuul. {rh^&amp;*JUr*A Ot * j&amp;t^S'JUArx*. 4**&amp;W*y 4* tLv»Zru »J is+T+u) , &lt;W ^V.

Lftiti , k*7 T?m , Z (‘tn r f t/ 7 # It has been suggested that the Shaikh of Bahrain should be brought into the picture, but, with respect, I cannot see how he is concerned. He has no connection wAi the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, and the less he is asked to involve himself in its affairs the better. If he were left out, the Bahrain Company could not make the ShaikhPs concession the basis of a claim for evading payment of these dues, and the Saudis (who already charge heavy port dues at Ras Tanurah without providing any facilities whatever) would not be encouraged to impose further exactions. The payments to the P^psian Gulf Lighting Service could be made at Bahrain, or, preferably, by the Oil Companies concerned direct to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service at Bombay, The Saudis might raise objections to payments being made to the Political Agent, Bahrain, if they come to hear about it, since No.5 of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's beacons is just within their territorial waters. Should, however, either Bahrain or Saudi-Arabia ever claim any portion of the lighting dues our reply would be that we make no profit out of this Lighting Service, and that there is, therefore, no question of sharing the profits with anyone. This was the attitude taken up with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah when he raised the question of our maintaining a light on Tamb Island. 8. I suggest that we should adopt the following procedure to attain our ends. It is admitted that the tankers transporting the oil won by these Companies belong to many different concerns and are very rarely owned by the Oil Companies themselves, and there will obviously be great difficulty in collecting dues from the tankers leaving Ras Tanurah, as we should have no control over them. I suggest, therefore, that the Oil Companies should themselves be asked to assume this7^ VwL^M' lt\ u fu ^ (V Ru* to— a*. u t «5 (aJ vUl- i’dtUu kSV*^ *»«** tA^LJ)' ^fu c, . ^ v obligation and pay the dues incurred by the tankers thatr^call, in return for the benefits conferred by our Lighting Service. They will claim that they have already paid large sums for the installation of certain lights, and that they pay out further amounts annually for the servicing of their private buoys and beacons. As far as the Bahrain Company are concerned the answer is that they are private lights and beacons and only benefit themselves, but the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's beacons leading to Has Tanurah are occasionally used by cargo vessels. If it is desired to make any concession we could meet them by refunding the capital cost of their buoys and beacons, and allow them to deduct from their share of the dues, which will only be two-thirds of those paid by vessels proceeding to the Shatt-el-Arab, the amounts which they now pay the Lighting Service for the upkeep of their private beacons. I should add that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's beacons are high steel pile structures having their lanterns about 30 feet above mean High 7/ater, and that whereas the L.T.Nearchus can and does service the lights, the repairs to the piles can only be carried out with special equipment which she does not possess. 9. If the Companies do not agVfee, we should then inform them that (a) we can no longer maintain their private buoys and beacons which they will then be obliged to service themselves at a far greater cost than that which they now pay, and (b) we should warn them that, in addition, it is proposed to reduce the Bahrain lights to their former number and remove the light vessel which was provided mainly as a facility for the Oil Companies' tankers. 10. This should rapidly b£ing them to their senses, and I feel sure that they will then agtbe to meet their proper share of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. There is no need whatever for either the Shaikh of Bahrain or the Saudi ArabianGrovernment to be brought into these discussions, which will simply be in the nature of a business deal between the two Oil Companies and the Persian Culf Lighting Service. Il^is essential that they Should be made to pay, for not only is the position by which cargo vessels using Bahrain pay on every ton they carry while tankers escape scot-free intolerable, but the additional payments from these Oil Companies will reduce the rates which are now borne by cargo vessels calling at Bahrain en route to the Shatt-el-Arab. 11. It is unfortunate that the question of the Light Dues was not taken up when we first agreed to instal and service these Companies 1 private beacons, and we should lose no time in safeguarding our position with the Kuwait Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited. The former, who will benefit greatly from the light just sanctioned for Kubbar Island (reference your Endorsement No.F.68-N/39, dated the 25th March 1940), have already found oil in large quantities and are nearing production, and arc -nearing p*^duotpm» and the latter have recently struck oil in Qatar. I suggest that they also should be asked to pay 66i% of the full dues, provided their tankers do not la/ter proceed to the Shatt-el-Arab, since they will not be using the Route Lights to a greater extent than the Bahrain and Ras Tanurah vessels. The position will then be similar to that at Abadan, where I presume the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company pay the port dues either directly or indirectly on behalf of their own tankers and those chartered by them. I am sending copies of this letter to Peel and Weightman.Demi-official letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.450-S, dated the 24th June 1940, and enclosures. Subject:- Levy of Light Dues at Bahrain. Will you please refer to my demi-official letter No. 158-S, dated the 12th April 1940, on the ^above subject? I enclose a copy of a letter from Sir John Ward, the Port Director at Basrah, who is in charge of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. 2. With regard to paragraph 8 of my letter, it will be seen that the 3 Sitrah buoys maintained for the Bahrain Petroleum Company are of benefit only to those vessels making the Sitrah channel. These are either tankers or cargo boats discharging cargo for the Oil Company (though some of the cargo boats may contain cargo which is later brought round to Manama by lighter), but Weightman tells me that they are of value also to His Majesty’s Ships making Khor IJialiya. I do not think that this should alter the position, a.s the Manama cargo would have been unloaded at Manama if it had not been for the Oil Company and'WSrships do not pay light dues anywhere so far as I know. 3. As regards the Has Tanura beacons, it will be seen that No. 1 beacon on the Rennie Shoal is of benefit to all shipping and that it is suggested that it should be purchased from the Oil Company and incorporated in the regular establish ment of Persian Gulf lights. This seems a very reasonable arrangement for they are paying a stiff price for their upkeep. The British India rice steamers making the Ras Tanura do, however, use the other beacons though the mail steamers are usually sufficiently light to go direct from the Light Vessel by a special route of their own.2 4. As regards the proposal in paragraph 11 of my letter, that the vessels making Kuwait and not proceeding later to the Shatt-al-Arab should pay 66%% of the full dues, it jj|ll be seen that the Port Director considers this would be a fair charge.0 r\ Confidential. 662/40.

(1) The buoys which we maintain for the Bahrain Petroleum Co. are as follows:- Sitrah North Light Buoy. Sitrah South Light Buoy. Sitrah Middle Dumb Buoy. These buoys are of material benefit only to those vessels making Sitrah anchorage. (2) I attach for your information copy of the letter incorporating conditions covering the maintenance of the Has Tannura Beacons. With the exception of No.l, the Ras Tannura beacons numbered 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are of benefit only to vessels making Ras Tannura. No.l beacon however is situated on Rennie Shoal and is of benefit to all shipping proceeding from Bahrain to Bushire, Bandar Shahpour, or the Shatt-al-Arab. That being so it would appear that when light dues are levied upon shipping using Ras Tannura and Sitrah, this No.l beacon should be purchased from the Oil Company and incorporated in the regular establishment of Persian Gulf Lights. (3) In regard to Kuwait, I agree the suggested rate of 66% appears to represent a fair charge. L *lo K*- Yours sincerely Sd/- J.Ward. Encl.l.

In general, it seems to be of little practical importance whether or not the proposal to levy dues at Bahrein is adopted, as the volume of shipping affected v/ill be very small indeed* Since the Advisory Committee are anxious on principle that all ships using the Gulf should contribute to the upkeep of the lights, we do not think that the objections to the proposal put forward in our letter of the 30th December, 1935, are any longer of sufficient importance to justify further opposition to their wishes. providedT 1959 J provided that the Bahrein Petroleum Company do not raise some insuperable objection based on their agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein. 3. The substantial question seems to be whether the Company, in virtue of their agreement with the Sheikh, are likely to object to paying light dues, and, if so, whether the Government of India can overcome these objections. If vessels actually controlled by the Company are exempt, it would presumably not be practicable to levy dues on ships chartered by the purchasing companies, even though the latter do not possess any grounds for claiming exemption.

They consider that there are certain objections to the institution of a general levy of light dues at Bahrein, the main objection being that it would encourage the development of a rival port on Ha^a Coast. It has also not been possible to adopt the alterna tive proposal of asking the Bahrein Petroleum Company to make an annual lump sum contribution towards the upkeep of the lights based on the tonnage of their ships entering the Persian Gulf, as few of the tanl^ships taking oil from Bahrein are actually controlled by the Company. 2. The Government of India would be gg/ld if the position is explained to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Committee and they are informed that the views expressed by them have already been taken into account by His Majesty's Government in arriving at the decision that the matter should be held in abeyance until a decision has been reached in regard to the future administration of the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Service.ft » ICopy of a letter No.PG./4Q5£, dateS—tfro-■■ -October 1938&gt; from the Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Commerce, Simla.

I note that Government consider that there are certain object ions to instituting a general levy of light dues at Bahrein, the main objection being that it would encourage the develop ment of a rival port on the Hasa Coast. I cannot agree that this is a sufficient reason for holding this matter in abeyance until a decision has been reached in regard to the future administration of the Persian Gulf Light ing Service, as I consider that light dues should be levied on all vessels using the Persian Gulf lights, irrespective of the port in the Persian Gulf to which they are proceeding. I also see no reason why the Bahrein Petroleum Company should not be asked to contribute a lump sum towards the upkeep of the lights based on the tonnage of their ships entering the Persian Gulf and obtaining the full benefits of those lights, or why the tankers not controlled by them should hot be charged separately, as they also benefit by the lights.

Z. 6153/37 of the 21st September about the proposal that the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be asked to contribute to the Persian Gulf Lighting Fund. 2. * This proposal was made on the supposition that, with negligible exceptions, the ships of the Bahrein Petroleum Company were the only ships which used the route lights without contributing to the Fund (see India Office letter to the Government of India No.P.Z.860/36 of the 18th February, 1936 in which the proposal v/as put forward). This supposition was confirmed in the letter of the 2nd April, 1935, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Government of India (copy enclosed in India Office letter to Foreign Office No.P.Z.2379/36 of the 23rd April, 1936). Claus on now suggests that a good many of the tankers are not controlled by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. . • £.• A &lt;• p ■ It/ A. C. B. Symon, Esq. 1 5 00718®It would clearly be impossible to ask the Company to contribute in respect of tankers not controlled by them, and therefore we would suggest that, before going any further, the Government of India should ascertain what proportion of the tankers which use the lights and do not touch Abadan or Bushire are, in fact, controlled by the Company. It may be, moreover, that, with the growing importance of Bahrein, there are noy/ other ships which call there and do not go to Basra. The further delay which v/ould result from these enquiries would not, we think, be altogether a bad thing, because now that the Persian Governments decision to take over responsibility for the light at Qais has made the general situation as regards the route lights somewhat uncertain, the moment is hardly a good one for tackling the Petroleum Company on the subject of a contribution. At the same time, by instituting further enquiries, we shall be keeping the proposal alive.l#A Hi js 7 ^ ?.Z,6153/37. INDIA OFFICE, 1 WHITEFIALL ?

Question of levying light dues at Bahrein* Please see d.o.letter dated 30th December from F.O. of vtfiich a copy was sent to you by air mail on January 6 th. After considering points raised by F.O* 1 am inclined to opinion that it would be unwise to take any steps at present towards the institution of a levy at Bahrein. Apart from any other considerations Government of India will no doubt agree that risk of encouraging development of port on Hasa ?Cuf k lyui) ok )rCi jy coast is a real one. The most satisfactory solution of the problem might be to request the Bahrein Petroleum Company to make an annual lump sum contribution towards the upkeep of the lights based on the torinage of their ships entering the Persian Gulf and not proceeding to the Shatt-el-Arab, on the ground that theirs are the only ships that Um use the route lights and do net contribute, to the fund. I presume it is still definitely the case that apart from the Bahrein/flW.l J. a WALTON. Bahrein Company’s vessels the number of ships entering the Gulf without touching at Abadan or Basra is negligible. Such an arrangement would of course include ships going to and from a Saudi port as well as Bahrein, and so would avoid risk referred to above. 2. 1 should be glad of Government of India’s views on this suggestion with a view to its consideration in due course by H.M.G. 3. In the circumstances I do not propose to attempt to make any alteration in the draft deed to amend the Bahrein Petroleum Company's lease, Suoh action would in any case be undesirable at this stage of the negotiations.r- 7 ) / u .

In addition to the considerations mentioned so far in the correspondence, it must not be overlooked that there is a proposal afoot to substitute a light-buoy for the Bahrein light- vessel.

To B.O.T.only (The B.O.T. reference is M.14724/35). 2. In the light of the considerations mentioned by Baggallay, it may be well to postpone taking the action suggested in paragraph 2 of my letter of the 2nd December. Moreover, one of these considerations - namely that mentioned in paragraph 5 of Baggallay's letter - seems to cast doubt on the advisability of proceeding at all (or at any rate for a very considerable time) with the Government of India's suggestions in its present form. It seems desirable therefore to consult the Government of India further at this stage. 3. I enclose a draft express letter which contains an alternative suggestion. I should be glad to know whether you think this prima facie worth putting forward and whether you see any objection to the draft as a whole (which of course would not commit H.M.G. to any view). ^ . / CU/\a w i $toJl &lt; Yours sinoflfldEf ^gd.) M. J. CLAUSON 4^8«J\t FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. (E 7048/33/34) 30tli December 1935. My dear Clauson, I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter No. P.Z. 8400/35 of the 2nd December about the proposal to levy light dues at Bahrain. 2. In principle we see no objection to the Government of India’s proposal, which is in itself, of course, quite reasonable. We also agree that Ward ought eventually to be consulted about it. But before we ask our Embassy at Bagdad to take it up with him, we think the following considerations ought to be taken into account: and it may be that they will lead us to the conclusion that it will be better to postpone approaching Ward until the general situation is rather clearer. 3. In the first place there is the question of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s general and special rights with which you deal in paragraphs 3 and 4 of your letter. If the Company voluntarily agreed to the levy of light dues/ M.J. Clauson. Esq.. OCdues 'by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service all would of course Le well. It would only be if the Company demurred to this that the question of a compulsory levy by, or by the authority of, the Sheikh might arise. We think that in that case the exemption from taxation which it is proposed to give the Company in their agreement with the Sheikh about the establishment of their refinery (see draft deed enclosed in India Office letter P.Z. 8659/1930 of December 5th 1935) would have to be considered. The text of Article III is worded very comprehensively. It is possible to argue that it does not cover dues levied by an officer of the Sheikh for a third party. But this argument might not prevail. It would still be possible to amend the draft agreement before it is signed; but we do not think any attempt should be made to do this except after very careful deliberation, especially in view of the considerations set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 below. In any case it would probably be desirable to make a King^ Regulation under the Bahrain Order in Council to justify the levy of a due by an officer of the Sheikh on British ships/mmaamm ships. 4, In the second place the question will require careful watching in view of the fact that suggestions for a closer co-ordination of the arrangements for collecting light dues in the Gulf may possibly emerge as a result of the impending Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Convention negotiations. It might be premature to fix on any scheme for Bahrain in advance of those negotiations; and it might, for that matter, be even more premature to do so in advance of the final transfer to Persia of the lights and buoys in Persian waters and of a final decision regarding the placing of a light vessel, possibly borrowed from Bahrain, at Parur shoal. It seems to us that it would be wise to settle these matters, if possible, before introducing a fresh complication into the Persian Gulf lighting t^&gt; problem. As you/, the Admiralty and Board of Trade are rather anxious the possiblity of the Persian Government charging excessive dues in respect of the Gulf lights which they will be taking over, and the imposition of a new due/due 'by us, or 'by Bahrain, at this moment might conceivably make it easier for the Persians to put on new and higher dues themselves, 5, Thirdly, as you know, shipping developments at Bahrain are always liable to be affected by developments on the Hasa coast. For example if the Standard Oil Company of California, which holds the Hasa concession, is thinking of developing a port at Has Tanurah - as we believe it is - any ill-timed imposition of light dues at Bahrain might conceivably tip the scale and end in a considerable volume of shipping, which would otherwise use Bahrain, going only to Has Tanurah instead, 6.

Prima facie the suggestion seems * reasonable one, but it is no doubt desirable, before taking any decision, to secure Colonel Ward’s views upon it. It is possible he may be averse from modifying the present system of levying dues, at any rate for the maintenance of route lights, in the Shatt-el-Arab only. 3. If it is eventually decided to adopt the Government of India’s suggestion, it will clearly be necessary, before introducing the new arrangements, to secure the consent of the party chiefly affected, namely the Bahrein Petroleum Company, since the present system rests primarily on the consent of the interested parties^as represented originally by the Chamber of Shipping and subsequently by the Bombay Advisory Committee^) and a new departure of this kind, affecting an interest not hitherto concerned, should presumably be based on the same principle. The Company will no doubt agree that they should/Mould contribute a fair share to the upkeep of the lights which they use - thoutfi •hey may, I suppose, claim representation C/ n the Committee and they may not agree 'hat the full Basra rate should be charged OX 8 t Bahrein. Apart from'general considerations it fould, in any case, be desirable to obtain 'the prior consent of the Company in view of the fact that the -light dues could only be collected under the authority of the . ihrein Government, who, however, have ecently promised (in connection with the tting up of a refinery in Bahrein and in eturn for certain concessions from the ompany) to exempt the Company from payment of all taxes and dues in Bahrein except certain specified state and municipal taxes. It is possible, therefore, that there migit be technical difficulty in enforcing the payment of light dues by ships which are the property of the Company if tne company were to refuse to pay. % If you agree with paragraph 2 above, and subject to any observations by (xrimshaw or by Seal, to whom I am sending copies of this letter, you will no doubt ask the Embassy at Bagdad to obtain Colonel A (t-ri*-'* uJm* d 1 s views on the suggestion.

The Government of India have endeavoured to ascer tain the tonnage of vessels likely to be calling at Bahrein in connection with the operations of the Bahrein Ppetroleum Company, but have been unable to obtain any accurate forecast* It is, however, anticipated that at least five tank-ships will call at that port during the current year and that as the Company are expecting to produce about 5000 barrels of oil per day the number of tank-ships likely to call at the port in subsequent years will be even greater. 4. The Government of India have also considered the procedure to be/adopted for the levy and collection of the lightdues at Bahrein in the event of the dues becoming leviable at that place and after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy, are of opinion that the responsibility for the levy and collection of the lightdues should devolve on the Port Officer, Bahrein, if the Government of Bahrein have no objection to kis undertaking the duty* They have also considered the question of the rate at which the lightdues should be levied and are of opinion that even though it may be urged that vessels calling at Bahrein and not proceeding to Abadan or Basrah use no lights west of Bahrein, the flat rate now prescribed for all vessels liable to lightdues in the Persian Gulf should he prescribed also forvessels calling only at Bahrein.

The measure was proposed by the Government of India in 1936, and further pressure was applied by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Committee in 1940. The latter claim was said to have been instigated by the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited, which paid dues on 'every one of their steamers that visits Bahrain, whereas a very large number of tankers with a far greater tonnage escape scot-free' (Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 12 April 1940, folios 204-210).The negotiations over the dues extended to include contributions to the work of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service as a whole, and also included the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC, later the Arabian American Oil Company). By 1946 it was said that negotiations had been going on for 'two or three years without any appreciable result' (folio 10).The papers include correspondence from the India Office; the Foreign Office; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Government of India; and the oil companies involved, particularly their representative, Hamilton R Ballantyne.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Lighting Service</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Buoys</topic></subject><subject><topic>Navigational aids</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001db#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
