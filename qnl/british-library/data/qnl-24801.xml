Consul-General must make his own arrangements in Persia. ii^i© Please see Miss Loughnane^ letter below. I have spoken to Mr. Young at the Foreign Office, and we are all in agreement that there is no reason why the Persian Consul-General should be given the facilities in India for which he has asked. If you see no objection it might be worth while informing the Govern ment of India accordingly on the lines of the draft telegram below. 19.ii.1945 . —— k'JS&amp;ZSB/KK/F m Your Reference..

The subject was th.j reactions of the Persian Consul General/ New Delhi, to the refusal of his application to the Indian exchange Control authorities to remit funds to the U.S.A. for the educational expenses of his son out there. 00 far as we know, the Indian Control’s practice (which is similar to ours)„ in the treatment of foreign nationals residing in India for business or official purposes^ results in very favourable treatment for the foreigners, since they are allowed to retain their U.S. dollar balances (the.U.S. dollar is the 'only specified currency' in India); they need not register their U.S. dollar securities; they can freely use balances in their own country for their own purposes*and they are allowed to remit liberally from India to their Own country/'or to the country in whose currency their salary is receive^). . This means that they are very much better off than Britighand Indian nationals and it seems very reasonably if*' the Persian Consul wants to remit to any third country he should get his foreign exchange from Persia and should not expect the /terling Area ^ool to provide it for him. 1 am afraid we have no information on the t Exchange Control regulations in Persia but if / B. D. Tims, Esq., India Office. /werewere to impose corresponding treatment on Briti^n subjects within their jurisdiction, I doubt whether we could complain. * I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr Yv.H. Young at the Foreign Office./^&lt;l /&gt;/. fyyi~- ‘• V.'r, HarpjLsor} Mar^' - thanlcs. I should at least be interested to see any further developments in this matter, but I think we might perhaps wait to see what points arise when the Ambassador replies, or if either the Foreign Office or the Treasury make any observations, before considering whether a transfer of the paper would be desirable. 1 . ii. 194!5v nw &amp; ^4 z. frU, i; fc- VL'*'*' Allotted to External Department^ Copies circulatede INV/ARD TiiLEGRM 1 2223- ■*-“■ s. n ^ ^ ±l: &lt; C CONFIDMTIAL CODJH GRAM ^ jx&lt; / &lt;v&gt;»v*^ U£* y From ru'hc Government of India?
