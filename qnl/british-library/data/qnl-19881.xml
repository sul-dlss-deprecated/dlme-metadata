'T Uo, 94, /?eg. A'o Oa^e British Legation, Tehran, ,#6, October 31, 1925. BUf. v.NCY sir.' lmm«: I have to acknowledge receipt of Bashire Residency Despatch No, 50/243/s of July 16th under cover of which was transmitted to me a copy of Llohammerah despatch Ito. 2/29/1160 of June 30th together with a translation of a petition signed 'by fort^nine Bahreini merchants of Mohammerah. 2. The question of the status of Bahrein is, as you are aware, one which has long 'been regarded as a matter in dispute 'by the Persian Government, v /hich has never specifically recogi -ised the British protectorate over that island, and its officials in consequence refuse to visa British passports when presented by Bahreinis. This Legation has for many years addressed complaints to the Persian Government in this connection but has never succeeded in obtaining the assent of the Central Authority to issue instructions to its officials in the Gulf Ports to put an end to these obstructi^ methods. 3. The present Minister for foreign Affairs to whim I have privately complained on many occasions about this obstruction has now proposed, and has instructed his officials in the Southern ports to that effect, that the new Persian passport regulations which required every traveller to be furnished with a passport, shall not apply to Bahreinis who will be allowed to revert to the use of a form of identity paper, known Dieut-Colonel i'.B.Prideaux C.S.I. , C.I.S., His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire.' -2- known as 'ilm u Khabar' which was formerly recognised as sufficient for Bahreinis travelling in the Persian Gulf. 4. In view of the fact that the question of the status of Bahrein is an 'impasse' out of which there appears to he at present no issue, I think that such a compromise as proposed by the Minister for foreign Affairs will at least obviate the difficulties which at present beset Bahreinis travelling between ports in the Gulf, 5. There appear to be many natives, some of them perhaps originating from Bahrein, who have settled in Mohammerah and whom the local authorities appear to regard as Persian subjects. In my conversations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the latter mentioned three names; Abdul Hamid, Hajji Abdullah and Haji Ambar whom the local authorities regarded as iPersian subjects but who presented British passports to the Persian Consul at Basrah for visa which was refused. The first named, and, perhaps the second, appear to be among the fortynine signatories of the I 'JO ' PQ'ti'tiorL enclosed in your despatch under reply. The third is stated to be an African and a gholam of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The Gholam has a son Hajji Jabber who is said to have a British passport and when asked why he was in possession of it the Persian Consul at Basrah informs the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he replied that it gave him greater liberty of action in Mohammerah. 6. I do not know what truth there is in these statements of the Persian Consul but I should like to have a report in that connection from His Majesty's Vice Consul at Mohammerah in due course. A copyA aopy of this Despatch is being sent to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, the Government of India, His Majesty's Vioe Consul at Mohammerah, and to His Majesty's High Commissioner at Baghdad with the request that,if he has no objection, he will be so good as to transmit a copy to the Administrative Inspector, Basrah. I am f Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,Extract paragraph 376 from Muhammerah Diary Ho. 21 of 1925, for the period 1st to 15th November 1925. Bahrainis . The Karguzar has received the following orders from his Foreign Ministry in regard to travellers of Bahrain! origin 'Customs should issue 'Ilm-o-Khabar f •to Bahrainis 'arriving in Persian ports or travelling to Gulf Ports 'on the Persian side or returning from such ports to 'Bahrain. If they pass through Persia In trans it 'any British Certificates of Identity they might possess should be exchanged for Persian Tazkaras.'19/109. Telegram R. From Resident, Bushire. To H.M's. Minister, Tehran. No. 120/736. Dated 26th November 1925. . Your despatch No. 54. ( Vice-Consul, Muhamraerah reports that Persian Foreign Office has (in effect) ordered Customs Department to issue Ilm o Khahar (Persian Certificates of Identity) to natives of Bahrain travelling between Persian ports including Bahrain : also to confiscate British Certificates of Identity and to issue Persian passports in lieu to those who may be proceeding to foreign ports. I submit that mention of compromise made in paragraph 4 of your despatch No. 54 is misleading as Persian Government by their orders clearly re-assert their claim that •Bahrain is Persian territory. Hitherto we have under protest allowed Persian Government to issue Ilm o Khabar to Persians and Bahrainis proceeding to Bahrain and to fine arrivals from there without such papers because inter alia (l) Bahrain Government has not intiroduced its own passport system (2) Shaikh Isa would have objected to issue of British passports to his subjects (3) We have failed to persuade Persian Government to modify their attitude and to issue real passports to Persians for Bahrain (4) these Persian ^Laax^iarix certificates are cheaper than passports. I fear that recent order has not ameliorated the political position and think that it should be accepted only under protest as a temporary measure. . It seems to me that we should try to reduce the number of Bahrain subjects in Persia and Persian subjects in Bahrain by ruthlessly rejecting the nationality claims of those who have practically severed connection with their countrycountry of origin and made their domicile abroad. British officials can then (except in Persia) issue passports for protected persons to Bahrainis, which Persian officials should not impound if dual nationality is pleaded. In this connection it seems that we shall always find the Nationality Law of Persia invoked against us on the ground that the ancestors of all Bahrainis were once Persian subjects. This attitude also seems to affect natives of British Bassidu. I will address you further by despatch. PRIDEAUX. % is,' / //&lt;?/'&gt; l &gt; No* 1724/16/1 of 1925.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of Bushire Residency Despatch No.50/243/S of July 16th replying thereto, No.94 of even date. 2, I have received lately several complaints about the obstruction made by the Persian Government officials in Mohammerah and Basrah as regards according visas to Bahreinis, holders of British passports. The reason for'these obstructive methods appear to be that the persons in question are claimed as Persian subjects owing to their prolonged domicile in Persia but underlying whatever contention is made, probably the real reason is Persian unwillingness to recognise specifically the right of Bahreinis to hold British passports. 3. In any case Bahreinis have been finding their freedom of travel between ports in the Persian Gulf consider ably hampered, therefore the proposal that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made that henceforth Bahreinis will be allowed to travel on a form of identity paper, appears to me to be an acceptable compromise which, v/hile leaving the fundamental question of their status alone, will permit them a freedom of movement which latterly they have not ertfoyed.

The situation as it now presents itself may perhaps be analysed as follows (1) Bahreinis travelling from one Persian port to another or to Bahrein are expected to taice out an 'Ilm-o-Khabar !t . This document, to judge from the specimen enclosed in your despatch, merely designates them as 'travellers from one Persian port to another'. The objection to it is not, therefore, that Bahreinis are thereby implied to be Persian subjects but that Bahrein is thereby implied to be a Persian port. This contention is not however very explicit and I consider that for purposes of convenience it may be ignored, and the practice of these 'llm -o -Khabars' may be continued. (2) Persians travelling to Bahrein are not provided with Persian passports. The implication is of course that Bahrein is not foreign territory, but as the Bahrein! Authorities do not require or ask for passports from foreign visitors, the principle implicit in the Persian procedure may in this case also be ignored. k SE ieut-Oolonel i 1 .B.Prideaux, C.S-I*, C-I-K-, His Majesty's Oonsul-Greneral, B U 3 H I H 3. Mw- / Vf /t)0 wmmm 0 i) - 2 - ignored. (3) Baiireinis travelling from BaJirein to Persian territory are given British certificates of identity. j.iie Persian Authorities have on occasions endeavoured to confiscate these Certificates and to replace them hy Persian papers, and even passports. it does not Beoiu that such incidents are due to more than excess of zeal on the part of local authorities, nor do I anticipate that they will be frequently repeated. it does appear however that a general practice exists of fining holders of British identity certificates a sum o± xlrans two for not being in possession of an 'ilm-o- iOiabar 11 . This means not only that all Bahreinis on arrival in Persia receive the impression that they are in some way to regard themselves as Persian subjects, but represents definite administrative action which we cannot allow to pass unchallenged. ^* 1 shoula oe glad to learn whether you endorse the above analysis and agree with the conclusions reached. Under each heading can be detected a desire on the part of the Persian GrOvemment to assert their pretensions to Bahrein, but it appears to me that the practice referred to under heading f3), as being the most invariable and the most effective is also the most dangerous. I would propose therefore, subject to your suggestions, to inform the Persian Grovernment that whereas, for purposes of local convenience, I am prepared to agree that Bahreinis proceeding from one Persian Tsi (A - 3 - i ^ersian port to another should taice out the certificate required of all such travellers, yet I fail to see the justification of fining them two Krans on their first reaching Persian soil from Bahrein. 3. copy of this despatch has 'been sent to the foreign Secretary to the GrOvernment of India, and a copy together with your despatch under reply has also 'been transmitted to His Majesty's principal Secretary of State for foreign Affairs.

Loraine 1 a despatch Ko. 4A 9 dated the 10th June 1926, on the suleject of travelling passes (l^-S-giau^r) granted the Persian Government to Bahrain subjects. ^&lt;-1' ^ loyelxt.4^ 2. I agree generally with y* analysis of the situation. out beg to make the following observations i (a) The stuart Sovereigns of England styled them selves 'Kings of England, Scotland, Prance and Ireland' long after the last vestige of French soil had been lost to the English crown. The fersian claim to sovereignty over Bahrain can be regarded as in the same nebulous category and receives no material support from the issue of llm- o- Khabar certificates for travellers to and from Bahrain* (b) If we recognise and temporarily tolerate the Persian contention that a Bahraini on Persian soil should be treated as a Persian national, or if we prefer to regard him as a person not enjoying capitulation rights, like a Muscat or Iraq subject, and therefore unentitled to British protection, it hardly seems logical that we should object to ble H. Bicolson, C.M.Q*, , s. Charge d*Affaires, British Legion, (V , . T ehran. 14^ to the levy of a two- Kran charge from as is leried from Persian subjects returning to Persia from Bahrain without the Ilm^ o- Khal&amp;ar . ( c ) The amount of the Ilm -o- lCiabar fee, rven when douliled, is insignificant# Its possession sayes the holder from pacing the cost or^ouTile cost of a passport which he mmm should possess if returning from Muscat or Iraq* (d) If the Persian Government could see their way to changing the form of this certificate so as to read 'from one port in the Persian Gulf to another' it would Ije quite unobjectionable and they coulu. honestly collect the fee from all persons unfurnished with passports, Oman travelling between Persia and Kuwait, Truoial rmt or Muscat as well as from the Persian porta® I am of opinion that His Majesty^ Legation can only take one of the two following courses now i- (a) to inform the Persian Government that, having seen a specimen of the Ilm -q - lOiabar subsequent to Sir P. Loraine*s conversation with the Minister for foreign Affairs in October last, they place on record the view that its use for persons travelling to Bahrain does not affect the claim to independence under British protection of the Chief of those islands vis-a-vis the Persian Government^ -er- (iij to ignore officially the fact that IIm- o- KhaDar certificates are used in a wrongful way* 4» The confiscation by Persian passport authorities of British passports and British certificates of identity is another matter altogether* It should &amp;e strongly • objected to* There are thousands of persons in Persia of Persian origin, who personally or through their fathers have ac quired British naturalisation in England, India or else- . , J where* These persons can only be regarded by the Persian Government as having two nationalities, and our rightto recognize tii«m as such also 1b i no on testable. Tiie Persian Goyernment cannot properly confiscate their British passports, acquired in their country of naturalization, even if such document b are to a certain degree inoperative in Persia. The case for British certificates of identity seems to tee similar. The benefits which these certificates confer on British-protected persons travelling to India or Iraq are appreciable. Moreover the possessors of them in Persia also are atele to count on British Consular gooa Oxiices, which are lay no means a negligeable asset. 5.

I have the honour to forward herewith, a copy of letter No.275/P t dated the . 24-th October 1926, froc the Adviser, Bahrein State on the subject of inspection of passports of arrivals at Bahrein. The inspection of passports of passengers arriving at this port both by steamers and sail in;-- boats is very desirable \ At present Bahrein appears to be a dumping fifround for a lar^e proportion of the undesirables and bad characters from all countries bordering on the Persian Gulf, These persons are attracted by reports of the rrealth of the merchants and the ease v;ith -rhich a living can be earned owing to the prosperity of the Islands. These reports are exaggerated and the influx of undesirables has become a danger to the Bahrein State. I consider that the Bahrein State, just as gome other larger and more important communities can justly claim the right of picking and choosing among the applicants for admission to its shores. • But before this system can be enforced it will probably be necessary to notify the passport authorities in the Gulf arriving Porta that passengers/at Bahrein either by steamers or sailing Identity boats not in possession of passports or Certificates of/ will from TO Sir,will be re^UGQd arlmittanoo at th« dlecrotion of tbe Eabrftin G^tat©, If the non'hle the Political Resident agrees with me that the power ta exclude undesirables should be exercised by the Bahrein Government* I venture to recommend that he should very kindly arrange to notify all the neighbouring States, whose subjects are likely to be affectedjthat the Bahrein State reserves to itaelf the right of excluding any person arriving at the Islands whether by steamer^ or sailing boat vrheae passports are not in order.

''ill you please let rae know v/hether It ia the caye that no passports or certificates of Identity are required by persons coning from Muscat to Bahrein. Sone weeks ago a register was opened, and is being kept by the Customs Department, giving names and partidulars of all arrivals from Mail Beats at Bahrein. It is observed that numbers of persons, ex levy and police-men, and vagrants of both sexes arrive here from Muscat and from other 'ulf Ports, with no papers, some stating that they are looking for dfoevS ^ . h H work and/giving their professional description as Beggars . His Excellency Ghaikh Hamad is anxious to clear Bahrein of foreigners who are living here, outwardly prosperous, but with no employment or apparent means. He understands that he can do nothing in this matter himself, but if persons without passports or without work could be refused admission, on the discretion of the authorities, it is thought that this might, to a certain extent minimise the frequency of thefts, etc., in Bahrein, whic?i are in most cases proved to be the work of foreigners. The Hon'ble the Political Resident enquired into the system of inspecting passports, during his recent visit. No such system exists as far as the Bahrein State is concerned, but if it msets a* with your approval,^Police Superintendent, or Police Clerk could accompany the Medical officer to the boats and inspect passports on board, but at present nothing is being done by the Bahrein State in this c onnec t i on. v T hope if this is entirely an Agency affair, that you will not mind my drawing your attention to it, but I am doing so, as the result of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad's frequent conversation on the subject.

Sir, With reference to your letter P 237^ of July 20th last, respecting the grant of travelling passes to Bahreinis, I am directed 'by Secretary Sir Austen -Chaiiiberlain to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Kajesty 1 s Charge d 1 Affaires at Tehran from which it will 'be observed that Mr. Hicolson proposes tacitly to accept the present position under which Bahreinis travelling from one Persian por^ to another or to Bahrein are expected to take out an '•Ilm-o^ Khabar', while Persian nationals travelling to Banrein a not provided with Persian passports. Mr. Jicoleon al~o ■oroposes energetically to protest against the confiscaoion by the Persian authorities of any British passports or certificates of identity granted to Bahreinis travelling from Bahrein to Persian territory. 2. With regard to the certificates of identity referred to, I am to invite attention to the despatch No. 34/2026 of Hay 20th last from His lilajesty's Consul General at Bushl re to His Majesty^ T-Iinister at Tehran, a copy of which was enclosed in the letter from this Department 'To. T 8352/235/378 of July 9th, from which it will be seen that these certificates are issued in Bahrein or Iraq, and that the holders' claim to their possession is open to doubt. In tnese circunibtancv.£ it is felt that it would be impolitic to protest against the confiscation of such documents by the Persian authority:--. As on the other hand it is impossible to acquiesce in the regular seixure of any class of British documents by a foreign authority, the best solution would seem to be to put an end to their issue.82 3. I am to suggest also that no steps be taken by the Bahrein Government with a view to the issue of their own pass orts since Sir Austen Chamberlain entirely concurs in the objections to such a step as set forth in Sir P. Lcraine T s telegram !To. 32 of March 16th last to wo1oue1 Prideaux, a copy of which was enclosed in India Office letter P 1220 of April 8th. 4. Sir Austen Chamberlain will be glad to learn 'hetier the Earl of Brikenhead agrees with this view and will cause the necessary instructions to be issued, subject to his concurrence he proposes generally to approve Mr. ^Ticolso^s attitude, but at the same time to inform nim O' tne action to be taken resnectinr c-rtificates of identity and to instruct him to ignore any case of seizure which may come to his notice before the new instructions have time to reach their destination. 5.

Sir, I an directed by the Secretary of State for India U to j e:r l 'O your letter of the 1st October, No. T. 11069/235/ji . | • 378. relative to the -rant of travelling panres to subjects ! o_. .-k-hrcin and to say that, before causing instructions to 1 be issued in the sense suggested by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he would prefer that the question ! should be re-examined with reference to the points mentioned below. 1 - i ' h3 ^i^st place the Sari of Birkenhead is unable, to iina justification for the statement, made in paragraph j 2 of your letter, that according to the letter addressed by Hi? r jesty's Consul General at Bushire to His Majesty-s Minister at Tehran on the 20th of May last the dairr of r ^ 1 ' 1:1 - &gt; certificates issued in Bahrein or Iraq to the possession of such certificates is open to t. Lieut,Col.-'rideaux refers especially to the posses sion of these certificates of Bahreinis residents at --ohammerah, but he does not suggest that subjects of Bahrein ao _Goiac:ej l;i Persia have thereby acquired Persian nationality in supersession of their former status. So long as such persons do not voluntarily adopt Persian nationality they would appear to be entitled to retain these certificates of identity, nor would there appear to be any objection, in principle, to their being registered as M _ British, c-ctected persons. It will be recalled that in 1906 ( tele t.ram to i. eh ran. Mo. 28. 9th February 1906) ard again in 1908 (Tehran despatch No. 101. 24th April, 1908) and in 1909 .(Tehran despatch No. 116. 4th June 1909. the Persian Government were informed that His Majesty-s Government con- sidored the island of Bahrein and its irhabitants to,be under British protection. I to invite a reference in this connection to the arrangements made in 1910 for the protec tion of Bahreinis at Loiaramerah. a report of which was madeto Sir E.Grey in Tehran despatch No. 235 dated the 23rd December 1. 10. An agreement was then made locally with the Sheikh of r .. ohair-erah to the el'iect that Bahreinis who had talcen up resi dence at kohamraerah since the accession of Sheikh Khazal should | be registered by His Majesty's Consul as British-protected persons upon application to him, and that the children of such persons should also be entitled to registration. The Persian n Government, however, were not infoimed of these arrarBements, | and this Department is unaware whether any reply was made to Sir G.Barclay's despatch, in the last paragraph of which he invited the concurrence of Sir E. Grey in approving them. It j would appear, however, from Bushire letter dated the 22nd l! ^u. r, lai,-. ( ( a copy of which was sent to you with India ( ice letter :'.80i on the 3rd ' arch 1913) that these ar range- mv ' ' v ' 0 ' J-orce at that time: and in any case they show the attitude which the Minister at Tehran and British ! officers in South Persia then considered themselves, authorised to adopt x.i leg^rd uo the protection of Bahreinis at Mohammerah. v.. 3 * It ls true ' th6t in Ms letter of the 2'oth'May Lieut. Col. ) Prideaux appears to hold ttaat a Bahreinl is not entitled to a British Passport (as distinct f TO m a certificate of identity issued by a British Officer) unless he has already become a ! naturalised British subject. It may be recalled, however, that 111 Juiie lil8 . ihe Government of India, as a war measure issued i-^tractionr to the following effect (see enclosure to India a .nee letter ?.3510/18, dated the 17th August 1918)-'All j subjects of States in the Persian Gulf and of the King of the Hejaz should be treated as British protect^ persons in the matter o._ passports, hen they hold no passports from their own rulers, and require than for journeys outside the Gulf, they should be granted Iniian passports describing them as'native of' • Muscat, Bahrein, Koweit, the Hedja z . etc.. as the case may be such entitled to British protection.' When such persons possess passports issued by their own Eulers. these should similarly be endorsed'. Subsequently i n August, 1923,(see this Ofuce letter I a 0. 3132/23 dated the 10th Septemuer) these orders were cancened in so far as they concern subjects of Musea ^ ^1&gt; ■ iiij Cct, Kov/elt and o^ the King of the Hejaz, but so far as this office is aware they still remain in force in respect of subjects of Bahrein. Without suggesting that it is necessari ly clsElrable at present to take up this point with the Persiai Government, Lord Birkenhead would be glad to learn whether Sir Austen Chamberlain dissents from the view that a subject of ijt.hrein which, though not formally a British protectoratei has been repeatedly declared by His Majesty's Government to be under Protection and the foreign relations of which are under^control- is entitled to hold a British passport as a British-protected person. The grant of such passports to Bahreinis would be the natural counterpart of the arrangement vhich was on he point of being introduced in 1923 (see your letter- 'o. E. 1485/67/91, dated the 14th February 1923) under v ,j ;ic;-i Persian subjects proceeding to Bahrein would be re quired to provide themselves with a British pass or visa. 4 ' lhe a,00ve considerations appear to Lord Birkenhead to invalidate the inference drawn in paragraph 2 of your letter, that it would be impolitic to protest against the confiscation of British certificates of identity by the Persian authorities. Moreover, in the only recent case of such confiscation that is on record (see enclosure to this 0±j.lce letter p.73 of the 20th Januaiy 1926) when identity certixicate carried by two Bahrein subjects travelling from Banrein to Debai were confiscated by a Persian passport officer at Lingah, there would seem to have been no doubt hauever respecting the title of the holders to the possession of these certificates. In view of the rarity of cases of con fiscation of British papers and of Sir P.Loraine's statement /(see his letter of lOt^Tune to Lieut. Col. Prideaux. copy enclosed with your letter T.8352/235/378 of the 9th July)that 'it does not seem that such incidents are due to more than excess of zeal on the part of local authorities, nor do I antl cipate that they will be frequently repeated', it would appear that matters have not yet gone so far that the alternative. unlessr*\ f\ f^] r&gt; unless the issue 01 certificate is discontinued, is between protesting against and acquiescing in the regular seizure of uiioish certirici..tes o... Identity by the Persian authorities. 5. Lord Biricenhead is therefore of opinion, as at prese t advised, that no sufficient reasons exist for teimi- nating the issue of British certificate of identity to jcbreini rabjects. . oreover this course, would appear to be open to serious objection unless the Sheikh of Bahrein is permitted to issue his own passports or travelling documents (rahdaris) such as he issued before the war. Prom recent letters of Lieut. Col. Prideaux (dated loth'uay and jiotL^uly) it wilx be :voted that the British certificates confer appre ciable benefits on British protected persons travelling to India or Iraq, and in Persia also enable than to count on the good Ox .aces o^ - ritish consuls. Passengers also on steamers sailing between India and the Persian GuS|.f are required to carry i.rave 11 ing documents of some description. If British ccrtilicates 01 identity are no longer to be granted to ^c.r.reiniE, and if the Sheikh of Bahrein is prevented from issaing his own documents, th^only alternative open to Bahiei. iu ' o wish to take out papers when going abroad would be to obtain Persian passports. Lord Biikenhead finds it dix icult to oelieve that Sir Austen Chamberlain would con- tcmolate such a surrender to Persian claims to sovereignty over Bahrein. 6. oubject to any further views that Sir Austen Chamberlain may wish to express. Lord Birkenhead would suggest that, in the absence of satisfactory alternative arrangements, British certificates of identity should con- time to be issued to subjects of Bahrein, and that His Majesty's Minister at Tehran should be Instructed to make an energetic protest if any further instance of the confiscation of British docur^nts occurs. As regards the Ilm-o-Khabar passes, if sir Austen Chamberlain is not prepared to run the risk of re-opening the whole question of the position of Bahrein at the present time, he will not resist the view that His4 ! T is Majesty's Government should tacitly acquiesce In the v compulsory issue of those passes by the Persian authorities | to Bahreinis e .tering and leaving Persia, unsatisfactory and i illogical as this course may be. 1 a copy oi this letter is being sent to the Colonial i 0111 ce.

Sir, Tith reference to your letter P 3365 of the 4th ultiijo , ^- pecting the grant of travelling passes to subjects of Bahrein, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to inform you that he has given careful considerc' 'Lion to Lord Birkenhead* s sUf^gc-s tion that, in the absence of satisfactory alternative c.irangementa, British certificates of identity should continue to be issued. On political grounds it is of great importance to avoid any action which would result in the re—av/akening of the controversy as to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and it is difficult to see how this could be avoided were the seizure by the Persian authorities of British certificates of identity issued to Bahrein subjects to -icoiiie - general practice. The only alternative to faci -fie lajor question would then be to acquiesce in the soizai ^ 0.* Bri .ish document by a foreign authority, a course i 'lich appears equally open to objection. On the ^^ --j : A je ten C lamoerlain is desirous of m ^etinp* the views expressed in your abcve mentioned letter, and a middle course has accordingly been sought, and it is thought that a satisfactory solution has been found by a study ol the earlier history of these documents, Tt is stated on page 3 of the memorandum enclosed in the despatch No. 34/202-S of May 20th last, addressed by His Majesty^ Consul General at Eushire to His Majesty^s Minister at Tehran, a copy of uhich was transmit : ,ed to you with the letter from this department T 8352/ 235/ 378 of July 9th, that /it was in 1915 as a war measure, that orders were first issued that all ' v e i lers roir, Arab towns to places outside the Persian4 - j' j. (\% ersian C-ulf, i .e» to Iraq^, India etc.) should furnish theraselves with British certificates of identity in pi; ce Oa' the letters of recoi.iuendation previously issued by the Arah Sheikhs of Bahrein, Dibai etc. to their subjects proceeding 5 ; broad. tliia Lleiaorandum Lieutenant Colonei Prideaux states that these documents, if submitted to a British political agent or Residency a ^ent, were endorsed in English, certifying to the holder's nationality and reco, mending him to the good offices of British officers, i.e adds t iat travellers . r ound the certificates so helpful that the practice became general of taking them out also ior journeys to Persia etc., &amp; ad that the practice continues. 5. There is no reason why Bahrein subjects should not still be given British documents for production to British .uthorities,(which seems to have been the sole jurpose for which they are originally issued) and I am therefore to suggest for Lord Birkenhead's consideration that the issue of 1' ese certificates should be continued, but with the addition of a clause to the effect that they are merely a reco^iendation to British officials and that ley are not intended ^or x^oduction to foreign authorities The use o' Ilm-o-Khabar for the purpose of travelling to Persia could at the same time be given tacit acquiescence as proposed by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at fe&amp;r&amp;z* in his despatch No. 394 of the 7th August last, 6. If the Government of Inuis ;^nd Government of Iraq were then informed that the additional clause was not intended to affect the value of these certificates in the eyes of their authorities, the documents would have the same value in practice as they possessed before the change, while the possibility of their seizure by the Persian authorities would be avoided.7# II this so?i.ution is held to be satisfactory it is Xjresumed that Lord Birkenhead will concur in the .laxntenance of the embargo upon the issue of passports by the Sh' ikhs themselves, I atii y q Q • f Sd.

Sir, I &lt;7 1 aiii dl ^ected by the Secretary of State to invite _your^aUention^to^tiie marginally noted correspondence witii -From Foreign Office dated 1st October 1926 ) the Porp-i n nrr- / Jo ditto 4th iJoveaber 1926.) ^ 0ftlCe (c0i ' le3 of f^ st - )ecem ' b er 1926 .5 which were sent to you with ^ ■ - my weekly letters of the 7th October, 4th Hovember and 6th January) on the subject of the grant of travelling passes to subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrein. It will be seen that in their latest letter the foreign Office suggest that the British certificates of identity now issued to liahreinis should continue to be issued to them, but wi tn the addition of a clause to the effect that they are merely a recommendation to British officials and are not intended for production to foreign authorities, and also that tacit acquiescence should be given to the practice of Persian officials in requiring Bahreinis entering and leaving Persia to take out IIm -o- Khabar passes. 2. The Secretary of State would be glad to learn the views of the Government of India upon the Foreign Office suggestion, the probable effect of which he is not in a position to estimate with confidence. The view of the foreign Office that the identity certificates were originally issued solely for the purpose of production to British authorities appears to be correct, and is borne out by the orders of the Government of India in their The Secretary to the Government of India, -ele^ram Foreign &amp; Political Department.hM. Af&amp;, *■*'&gt;&amp; sj telegram Ho.1086-D of the IZth March. 19x6, to the Chief Political Officer Basra (see Foreign and Political Department Proceedings, Kay 1916, General-A l-Iui 'bers 59-65). The identify certificates, if qualified 'by the clause suggested by the Foreign Office, would retain their value in the case of travellers to Iraq or India, and as travelling documents 1 or passengers on British steamers in the Gulf. .iie Political Resident, Bushire, has stated, however, ' (in his'despatch of the 20th May, 1926, Ho.34/202-3, addressed to Kis Majesty's Minister at Tehran), that the certificates are carried 'by travellers ('both Bahrein! and Persian) to Persian ports, and are accepted by Persian officials as Prool of the port of embarkation. The object of the Foreign Oflice suggestion is to avoid the production of the identity certificates by Banreinis to Persian officials and the consequent risk of their being confiscated. The result, however might 'be that travellers from Bahrein would suffer inconvenience from the want of any documents which they could produce before Persian officials on their arrival at a Persian port, or possibly they might frustrate the object aesired by the Foreign Office and use the identity certificates in the same way as heretofore. 4^ This difliculty might perhaps be limited by continuing to issue to other than Bahrein subjects the identity certificate now used, and issuing only to the latter a certificate qualified as the Foreign Office suggest. The ^ Political Resident has stated that of the 6,000 identity certificates issued by the Political Agent, Bahrein, in 1925 only 800 were issued to subjects of Bahrein, while 2,000 were issued to Persians. (Incidentally it may be i e.aai-Ked that Persian ollicials do not act consistently if they tolerate the possession of these certificates by Persian^ and confiscate them whn held by Bahreinis). But this suggestion, if practicable, would not affect the difficulty/Cr \ou i ^ vol w, a if J, icull.y m the case of Bahreinis, and the Secretary of Stale aoes not feel altogether satisfied with an arrangement which allows them neither British nor Bahrein papers for production to Persian officials and yields so completely to the Persian claim that they should carry Persian documents. It is difficult, however, without having recourse to the issue of passes by the Shaikh o| Bahrein himself ( a course which His Majesty's Government deprecate in their desire to avoid a revivjal of the question of the status of Bahrein by the Persian Government), to suggest any more satisfactory arrangement which will avoid the seizure of British documents by the Persian authorities. If, therefore, the Government of Inuia consider that the Porei^n Office suggestion can be put into effect, at least in the case of. certificates issued to subjects of Bahrein, without causing undue inconvenience, I am to request that the necessary instructions may be issued to the Political Resident, and that the Secretary of State may be informed of the action ■taxen in oraer that the necessary communication may be made to the Government of Iraq. • • 6. As regards the final paragraph of the Foreign Office levr.er oi the 51st Deceiuber and with reference to your letter ^ Itt or the 9til ^ruary, No.542^ it may be pointed out that the eiiibargo on tne issue of passports' applies only to the Shaikh oi Bahrein. Apart from considerations arisin^ with reterence to the position of Bahrein the Secretary of State is not aware of any political objections to the issue of their own passports by the Shaikh of Koweit or the Sultan of hiuscat. With respect, therefore, to the proposals referred to in your letter for the issue of Koweit passports I am to enclose, for the consideration of the Government of 2oth India, a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office, and to say that, provided the assurance desired by the foreign Office\ 4^ A Office can be given ty the Political Resident, the proposals are approved ty the Secretary of State.

Sir, Jith reference to your letter No.P.650-of tne 9th instant respecting the issue of passports by the Shaikh of Kuwait, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to state that the proposal is not in his opinion open to objection per se . 2. Lord Birkenhead will, however, remember that in the correspondence respecting the grant of travel facilities to iahreinis which ended with the letter from this department , ^ / ITo.T 14112/235/378 of the 51st of December last, attention was more than once drawn to the importance of preventing the Shaikh of Bahrein from issuing passports in view of the possibility that any such action on his palst might reawaken the claim of Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. 3. Sir Austen Chamberlain would therefore suggest that in their reply to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the Government of India should make their approval of the proposal subject to an assurance from Colonel Haworth that there is no risk of a similar step being taken in Bahrein. 4. The proposals as to visas contained in paragraph 4 of the Political Residents despatch seem unobjectionable.

A copy of the 1916 correspondence referred to in para graph 2 of that letter is also enclosed. It will be seen that the Secretary of State' does not feel altogether satisfied v /ith the solution of the difficulty which is put forward in paragraph 5 of your letter, but that he is prepared to agree to its adoption by the Governiiient of India unless they should feel a/iy insuperable objection to this course. With regard to the final paragraph of your letter the Secretary of State himself thinks that the most satisfactory solution lies in permitting the Shaikh of Bahrein to resume the practice which he followed up till 1915 of issuing his own travelling passes. Ke agrees, however, that permission to do so should be withheld from the Shaikh so long as, in Sir A.Chamberlain*s opinion, the governing political considerations justify this course.

The enclosed correspondence suggests that there is no great reason at present to anticipate further confiscation by Persian officials of British documents carried by subjects of Bahrein, and the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf consider that no change need at present be made in the practice of issuing British identity certificates to Bahreinis or in the form of tne certificates so issued. They also think tnat tae compulsory issue of the Persian H Ilm-o-Khabar M vto Banreinis may safely be ignored; and that no further action need be taken for the present in connection with the proposed issue of passports by tne Sheikh of Kuweit.

Sir, If} • I am directed 'by tiie Secretary of State for India to refer to Colonial Office letters i^o .59154/28, dated the 24th July and 1st August, to this Office, of which copies are under stood to have 'been sent to the Foreign Office, relative to the refusal of the Persian Consul at Basra to endorse the passx-)ort of one Kaji Hunfish, a native of Bahrein. 2. The exact position ol Ha j i xlanfish, and the facts of the case, are not very clear from the correspondence in question. Whereas however tne Persian Consul at Basra does not appear to question that Ha ji Hanfish is a native of Bahrein, the tone of his coiomunicat ion of which a copy is enclosed in Sir H .Do'cbs's despatch oi 16th June aud the statement in the enclosure to Colonial Office letter ^0.59154/28 of 24th July that he does not appear to have received the instructions referred to in Sir P. Loraine's despatch i&gt;io.574 of 5j.st Octoher 1925 together seem to imply that the intention is to disregard the undertaking of the then Persian Minister of foreign Affairs. The present time, when Persian claims to Bahrein are 'being asserted with such vigour, is not, however, one in which it is desirable to allow anything to pass which might 'be regarded as compromising the general position taken 'by His Majesty's Government on the status o^ the Islands, and, subject to any observations which the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs may have to offer, the Secretary of State for India woula therefore sujgest that immediate representations should 'be addressed to the Persian Government with reference to 1^. the arrangement entered into in regard to Bahreinis travelling in the Gulf in 1925 (Tehran despatch to the Foreign Office, ^0.574, dated the 51st October 1925 and connected correspondence), with a view to securing the issue of instructions to the Consul at Basra' Basra to comply in the present case with the procedure then accepted, it is assumed that such representations would 'be couched in such a form as to involve no recognition on the ^art of His Majesty's Government of Persian claims to suzerainty over Bahrein. It is perhaps unnecessary at this stage to consider the ^usot ion of tne action to ..e taken should the Persian Govjrnment refuse to recognise or to act on the arrangement in question, 'but t.e Secretary of 3tate for India is of opinion that, should they aaojt this course, t-ie answer s'.ioulu 'be a formal reassertion t' His 'i 'a J £ ty * s Government ox their inability to recognise the Persian claim, coupled with an intimation that, failing satis factory disposal of the case, retaliatory action in the matter of passports on the lines considered in 1923 (compare Foreign Office letter to India Office of the 30th June 0.922 anu connected papers) will 'be taken, r ■ A copy ol this letter is tein B sent to the Colonial Office, Mid i. copy oi a -e f ter which has 'been addressed to that Depart ment is enclosed.

J«', r%E?-rrett, G.S.I., C.I.E., To Political Agent, Bahrein, The Secrett-ry to the ♦ Hon 'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, In continuation of my No# 713 .0- 27th October 1928 I have the honour to forward a communication I have just rocoivtd from the Adviser t© Sheikh Earned, on the subject of Persian passports and Ilm-o-Kh?.bar. I quite agree that it is wrong^on principle^to permit Persians and especially Bahroinis^travelling on Ilm-©-Khabars granted by Persian authorities to enter Bahrein. The issue of Ilm-o-Khabars was however started long before the war and in 1913, in order save trouble, HaJ or Trevor who was'Political /vgent at Bahrein commenc- -ed endorsing them to show that the holder had actuci-ly arrived in Bahrein. We cannot therefore pretend that v /e have hitherto had no official information of the Persian practice of regarding Bahrein as a port of Persia. At the same time the recent Persian claims havi inflamed the Al Khalifa against the Persian Government and they wish to take strong action to show their emphatic rebuttal of Persian pretensions. The decision of which I have now boen ii 'oriuea, through Mr. Bclgrave, was reached after fumilj council and I havr to request that I rmy be instructed T.rtetl er I ton to let matters twice their court-t er an tc&gt; advletdelay • I hav« not t^ken steps to notify shipping companies of the Bahrein Government's decision, pending receipt of the Hon^lc the Political Resident's orders on the subject. As time is short I have to request th?t, if there be no objection, you will arrange to inform the British India Company at Bombay direct of the new regulation, so that there may be no misunderstanding , After Ist December, unless I receive instructions from the Political Resident^the Bahrein Police will forbid any Persian relying on an Ilm -o -IQiabar to land at Bahrein . The question of his destination v/ill then be a matter for the passenger to settle with the British India Ccmpany direct. % I have the honour to be, Sir, Y®ur most obedient servant, Political Agent, BahreinCopy of letter lie, G,33 d^tcd 8tli Novtmber 1928 ^ 25th Jsjnadi A1 Awal 1347 from the Adviser, Lahrtin State, Bahrein, to the Political Agent, Bahrein. I have the honour to state that His Excellency Sheikh Hamad has instructed me to inform you of the decision which he has made on the outgect of Persian passports and ' Ilm al Khubar'. His Excellency Sheikh Hamad has considered the matter very carefully. He has decided that to allow Persians to enter his territories on production of an ^&gt;0^110*11^1001 ' Ilm al Khubar which in reality is nothing more than pernit to travel between Persian ports, will be construed by the Persian Government as a tenta- -mount admission of the preposterous Persian claim that Bahrein is a Persian possession, which claim Sheikh Hamad and his subjects emphatically deny, H.E, Shaikh Hamad has decided that from 1st December 1S28, no Persian will be allowed to land in Bahrein unless he holds a proper passport or a certificate of identification signed by a British Consular Official. H.E. Sheikh Hamad wishes me to request your assistance in informing the proper authorrties and Ship- -ping Agents etc. of his decision. a H.E. Sheikh Harrjd has ordered his Police and Customs autherities to take vigorous fnd immediate action for the proper inspection of the passports of all passengers arriving at Bahrein on ships and native craft.

So although the 'breaches by Persia af the status quo in the matters of Basidu, Tanb and quarantine might be held to give us some measure of freedom and although the sub- -Ject of Bahrain might be excluded from the negot- -iations, we are inclined to recommend indefinte postpone- f -ment of the Shaikh's action. ;ve are fortified in this conclusion 'by the fact that the question has been referred to the League of Nations. Further, we douht whether the probable effect of retaliatory measures by Persia on his trade has been carefully considered 'by the Shaikh of Bahrain. If His Majesty's G-overnment concur therefore we consider that Political Resident should endeavour to dissuade the Shaikh.

The suggestion contained in that letter has been put to MX. Berry by Kr. Jardine. who has recently taken over the dutxe. of Administrative Inspector at Basrah, kr. Jardine now reports that in Mr. Berry 's view the Persian Consul meant by the expression -Persian travelling passports' regular passports ^nown as 'Tazkara Ifurur passeport de passage' and not ..Um-u -Khabar' and this opinion has been oonfimed on enquiry at the Persian Consulate and from other sources. Further Mr. .erry can recollect no recent use of a form of travelling permit desxgnated 'Ilm -u- Khabar'. he does however recollect the Persian Consul once saying in a conversation that he was always prepared to give to anyone he considered a Persian subject a piece of paper stating that the bearer was a Persian subject if he was too poor to pay for a real passport but who should nevertheless be allowed to enter Persia, axui it is possible, Mr. Berry thinks, that the present Persian Consul might be disposed to treat Bahrainis in that way, and has possibly done so. 3.

(iv) That the Persian consul at Basrah will only issue the full passport, and that only on condition that he impounds the British passport.

As regards the certificate of identity I should explain that this does not include the Persian document known as ^Ilm-o-lUiabar'*, which is in effect nothing more than a pass issued by the Persian Government to Persian subjects to travel from one Persian port to another. It is therefore suggested that it would be advisable to ensure that all Persian travellers to Bahrain on the vessels of your line were in possession of the requisite credentials as without these they will not be allowed to land at .Bahrain. 4.

I am further to invite attention, in this connection, to the des patch from the high Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No.C»0.1156, dated the 6th October, of which a copy is understood to have been communicated to your Department by the Colonial Office, relative to the refusal of the Persian Consul at Basra to endorse the British Passports of certain natives of Bahrein. 2. The Arab States affected by the Persian claim fall into two categories. The first category embraces Muscat, which is an independent State in treaty relations not only v ,ith his Majesty's Government but with France, the United states and ^ Holland, but which is not diplomatically represented at Tehran. The Second category embraces the Arab States of Bahrein and Koweit and the Trucial Sheikdoms, the foreign relations of which are conducted by His Majesty^ Government, v .hich are entitles in o varying degrees to a measure of protection or to good eificee from His Majesty^ Government; and which are precluded from direct diplomatic relations with Persia or other ioreign Governments. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l*Governments. • As Lord Peel understands the position, it is the considered policy of his Majesty^s Governcient that Persian aggression on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf or against those islands in the Gulf which are recognised by His Majesty^ Government as the property of the Arab Rulers, or to which a claim has been or may be preferred by those Rulers, should not be tolerated, and that an uncompromising attitude should be adopted in dealing with any Persian claim of the nature now under discussion. On this assumptionf the question now for consideration is the line of action to be adopted in dealing with Persia^ in regard to the series of incidents referred to in the correspondence. It will be seen that in the case of liuscat, the Government of India have suggested tuat advantiige might be seen in advising the Sultan to address a representation on the subject to the League of Nations, and it is clear that a special procedure will be called for in the case of this State, the status of which, as explained in paragraph 2 above, differs from that of the other Principalities affected. Lord Peel, however, is inclined to see strong objection to referring to the League of Nations any question in connection with the position of His Majesty^ Government in the Persian Gulf which can satisfactorily be dealt with otherwise, and he is disposed to the view that the most satisfactory course in the present case will be that simultaneous representations in strong terms should be made by His MaJesty^s Minister in regard to the whole series of incidents - air Robert dive's action in the case of Museat being based on a formal request to be made by the Sultan for our good offices in the matter, founded on the fact that His Highness has no diplomatic representative at Tehran, and■ Iand that the Persian Government at the same time should be warned that, failing the withdrawal of the obnoxious instructions, the Arah Rulers affected will be left free to take such r«ialiator/ action in the matter of passports as ma/ seem good to them# The secretary oi jt-atc recognises the possibility that representations of this nature to the Persian Government at the outset of the negotiations now to be undertaken b/ Sir Robert dive ma/ react prejudicial!/ on the progress of those negotiations, and he would see no objection, therefore, to postponing them until, Bay, the end of the /ear, b/ which time, it is hoped, the Sultan of Muscat will have returned to his ^tate, ^nd it will have been possible to appreciate the general attitude towards His Hajest/'s Government of Persia, It will be remembered that the question of re taliatory action against Persia in the matter of passports, etc., was considered in 1922 and 1923 in connection with Bahrein, and that the Government of India, the India Olliae and the Foreign Office, after considering the views of the then Political Hesiaent in the Persian Gulf and ot uis Majest/* s Minister at Tehran, approved the principle of such retaliatory action, and desisted from taking it only because of the serious internal position in Persia, Subject tj ^ne views of the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Attaiisy Lord Peel would propose immediately to take up .ith the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Gulf the question of the practicability of retaliatory action in the conditions of the present time, and the general line which it should follow, with a view to immediate action being taken should the representations on the matter to oe iaade to Persia produce no satisfactory result, and I am to enclose&gt; for the consideration of Lord Cushendun, the araft jf a telegramiW telegram on the subject to the Viceroy.

The Persian Government does not recognise any 'State' of Bahrain, considers Bahrain as one of the Persian Gulf Islands and a legal property of Persia and it is not prepared to adopt any formality for Bahrain Islands 'besides this. I have therefore the honour to inform you that no other document will 'be issued, for travelling to Bahrain, besides the 'Ilm-o-Khabar' (Certificate of Identity). The Bahrain inhabitants who arrive with foreign passports will also not be allowed to enter Persian ports. U.E. Sd. Mozaffar A'alam.

Willi reference to recent correspondence on the subject of Bahrein and the new passport regulations which have come into force for travellers arriving at that island, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith translation of two articles /O • whlch appeared in the Tehran paper ' Shafagh-i-Surkh ' on the 27th and 28th of December last. 2. His Majesty's consul-general, Bushire, received notification at the end of December from the Bushire local authorities that the Persian Government considers Bahrein its legal possession, is not prepared to accede to any formalities for the island and intends to continue issuing the former identity passes to persons travelling there. Inhabitants of Bahrein who arrive in Persia on foreign passports will not be allowed to land. 3. It will be seen that these instructions conform closely with the language used in the article of the 28th December, and there is no doubt that the articles published here were inspired. The Government has, however, so far refrained from raising the question with me, and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs made no mention of Bahrein on the 2nd instant when I paid him my weekly visit. It may be. however, that Taimourtache is reserving it for discussion on Monday, the 7th January, when I am to see him. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch with enclosures to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire. I have, &amp;c. R - H CLIVE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Extract from the Tehran Newspaper ' Shafagh-i-Surkh Jy of December 27, 1928. (Translation.) OUR special correspondent from Bahrein reports, dated the 16th Azar (the 7th December) V The consul in Bahrein has recently paid visits to Qatar, Jabal, and other places, and it is learned that he has given presents, such as rifles and ammunition, to the sheikhs of Qatar. Ihe purpose is that presumably the consul is trying to attract the said sheikhs in order that if they (British Government) failed to secure the concession ot the air route through Persia they may be able to open an airway through the northern coast of the Arabian Peninsula; but the clever Arab sheikhs will not again be deceived. 2. About fifteen days ago one of the warships of the British Government came to Bahrein and was engaged in sounding the sea round about Bahrein. Some people imagine that since the Government of Bahrein is going to join the Islands of Manameh and Mohraq by a bridge, they are making preparations for that purpose, but the real reason is that now that the sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein is confirmed they wish to send their ships right up to the Arabian shore with the object of making the trade of Bahrein suffer. 3. As meteorologists have discovered that the weather conditions of Bahrein are not always favourable for the flight of aeroplanes and that they cannot land at all times on that island, the aviators and engineers, therefore, find the Persian coast more favourable for the flight of aeroplanes than the Arabian coast. 4. According to information received all officials and employees of the Government of Bahrein must hereafter wear Arab dress, and the police, &amp;c., who used to have Persian hats and coats, have changed their dress to Arab dress;' it is said that the Indian policemen will also change their turbans to Arab turbans [688 y 3]5. On Friday, the 14th Azar (the 5th December), the principals of the Persian schools (Ettehadieh and Okhovat) were summoned by the consul, who said that playing the drum and fife is forbidden by the Government of Bahrein, and likewise the Persian flag must not be used by the schools on certain occasions on which they used to use them. The schools were obliged to obey, but the Persians here are much annoyed because they regard this as a measure meant to stifle Persian national feelings. The British Government, which claims to lead the world in the way it should go, ought not to have done this because it is very unseemly, and although it is ascribed to the orders of the puppet sheikh, all know that the sheikh ignored these orders. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from the ' Shafagh-i-Surkh 'of December 28, 1928. (Translation.) IN editorial the paper, under the title 'Travelling to Bahrein forbidden,' states :— According to information received from our correspondent in Bahrein, which was reproduced in the last issue, the British consul in Bahrein has prevented our schools in Bahrein from hoisting the Persian flag and from engaging in othei national representations, and has, moreover, abetted in different ways the adoption of the native dress by dwellers in Bahrein. Of course, such measures are not taken simply for amusement, and it must be presumed that they are related to some policy which is to be adopted in order to repudiate the real claim of Persia to Bahrein, and in order to stifle, on the one hand, Persian national feeling, which is so much in evidence in Bahrein, and. on the other hand, to stimulate Arab sentiment in the inhabitants of that island. The fact that another report to this effect has been received from a reliable person in Bushire confirms the above opinion. This report came to us on Sunday last by air mail. According to it, the British consul in Bushire has lately instructed Gray Paul, which is the most important navigating company in the gulf, to abstain hereafter from accepting passengers for Bahrein unless they possess a passport for going abroad vised by the British consul. Otherwise, no ticket must be issued to such passengers. The Governor of Bushire enquired, and the said company in reply stated plainly that they will not issue tickets to passengers to Bahrein unless they possess passports and have visas from the British consulate; the company added that this is in accordance with the instructions of the British consulate. Up to now the Persian Government treated the (Bahrein) mail as inland mail, and used to give only a police or Governor's pass called Ilm and Khabar to the passengers. This is good proof that the British Government has not been able to deny our sovereignty on Bahrein until now. But now that Persia is claiming her right to Bahrein and the question has become one of the outstanding questions between the British and the Persian Governments, the former is trying to obliterate this remembrance and sign of Persian sovereignty over the island. They may do what they like, and, in the same way that they have gradually denied and obliterated every sign and trace of our sovereignty, they compel to-day travellers who are going to Bahrein to obtain passports in order that they may be able to repudiate Persian sovereignty absolutely when the case is brought up to the League of Nations. The Persian Government, however, have certain duties to perform in deference to past history and to the nation at this time, when Anglo-Persian outstanding questions are under discussion. All the inhabitants of South Persia, and especially the inhabitants of the southern ports, are earnestly and anxiously awaiting the result of the discussions between Persia and England relating to Bahrein. In our opinion the question of Bahrein must be one of the conspicuous and clear points in the Perso-British discussions. As a matter of course, if the British Government show some favour to the Persians regarding their ravished rights to Bahrein it will help considerably to create a friendly atmosphere between the two nations, and it will be one of the effective means for strengthening the relations between the two Governments. The question of Persian sovereignty over Bahrein is based on so much proof and evidence that the latest step taken by them (the British) will have little effect uponour claim, but it will certainly cause difficulties for the people of the southern ports. The Persian Government has never deemed, and will never deem, Bahrein to be a foreign country, and consequently w T ill not issue passports to its subjects who are travelling there. If the British consulate insists upon this innovation, the result will be the discontinuation of intercourse between the inhabitants of the ports and Bahrein, and consequently difficulties and losses will arise for those who are in touch with Bahrein and w ho are accustomed to go there. If only, instead of acting thus, i .e., indulging in futile and vain grabbing, the British consulate had awaited the discussions in Tehran, it would have been more praiseworthy, for perhaps the question would have been-settled in a better way and more in accordance with our hopes and expectations.Telegrazrj H, PTOYr H.M* s • Minister, Tehran.

It has been suggested to us that the wording of this correspondence does not make it sufficiently clear that British identity certificates are never, in any circumstances, to be given by British Consular officers to Persian subjects in Persia . It was certainly our intention, and I think yours too, that the oractice of issuing British travel documents to Persian nationals should be allowed to continue only in those ports on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf where there are no Persian Consular officers to issue Persian documents; and I myself scarcely think it likely that this corresoond ence will be misinterpreted by the Consular officers concerned.

D . , foreign secretary to the Government of India, m i .: LHI.♦ . .Bahrain, 13th February 19 Dear Dickson, There is 4;oing to be a little difficulty about the trial of certain persons accused of robberies and murder extending over a period of years. Arnong other charges against them is an attempt to assaarinate Shaikh Hamad in October 19J?6. They have all made confessions recorded by Saiyid Siddiq in which they admit having joined with others in gang robberies, but throw the blame of actual ralfrder and attempts on other members of the gangs. The Shara Court in the circumstances would not sentence these persons to death though we can have them under the 1. P. C. The Sessions Court consisting of myself and Assessors will try the foreigners but there are also Bahrain subjects among the crew. These Uahrai^people will toex shortly be had before Shaikhs Mahomed and Abdulla as Shaikh Hamad does not wish to try a case in which he is personally interested. in the point of this Shaikh Abdulla is accused by the prisoners of being the instigator of several of the offences. H A M came to see me this morning to impress upon me tl^e importance of finoiing out the guilty persons and punishing the tools only. You xnow his unctious h style. Also he aske that the trial be secret, a matter on which Shaikh Hamad also lays stress. i told them they could do as they liked in their own Court but I should have 3 assessors, Abdulla asked that they should be put on oath not to talk ! i' It is a pity v-o hawe two Courts dealing with the one case and 1 personally should like to hand all the accused, who are Gulf Arabs, over to tiow ^haikh Hamad for- 2 - for trial. it woulA simplify matters and they would get Arab justice though very much tempered by Shaikh Hamad's mercy. However the Bahrain Order in Council exists and I shall have to get on with the case. The orders forbidding the issue of Certificates of Identity to Persians not in postsession of passports are a bit of a nuisance. Bahrain is full of such person^ and if they have no passports or Gertificates of identity the B. 1. will not take them. i issue certifi cates of identity to all other nationalities, permitting them 'to return home' so it is invidious to make an exception in the case of Persians. The trade of Bahrain is largely in the hands of Indians and Persians, to whom Bahrain is undoubtedly beholden for their enterprise. i do not think it is to the advantage of the Bahrain State to do*anything to restrict the free entry and egress of Persian traders, with whom they have no quarrel. The bone of contention is the ilm-o-Khabar, which Bali rain naturally refuses to recognise as the document makes pretentions claims to sovereignty. The Certificate of identity is a very harm less document w^ich is of value in getting the holder out of Bahrain and also is a proof of port of embarkation if such proof is necessary, even though it may have no further value in Persia. i should like therefore^ if Hir Frederick will agree, to continue its issue to Persians, not possessed of passports, to enable them to return home. An alternative would be to permit the 'Bahrain otate to issue passports and travel documents subject to my visa. His Majesty f s Government have however refused to permit this since the war, but, perhaps, in the xslx new situation that has arisen, they may be disposed to reconsider their decision. Would you very kindly put the matter before Sir Frederick in his return from Tehran. He asked me toto let him know at once if any difficulties aroae in carrying out his directions.

In the circumstancee the Bahrain Government, with the Political Residents approval, commenced the practice of granting Persians the necessary permission to return home and at the same time, in desirable cases, issued a document authorising the bearer and members ol his family, mentioned by name, to return to Bahrain. The permit to enter Bahrain is also in special cases, granted to Persians residing out of the islands. In this way hardship to pearl divers working for Arab merchants and to other persons engaged in genuine trad-n^ operations is avoided, while at the sane time the Bahrain Government refuse to recognise Persian Ilm-o-Khabar b » The Political Agent does not countersign those documents, nor is any reference made to him before they are issued. 5, The Bahrain Government, who propose to coi&gt; -tinue these special permits to Persians, who are persona gratia to themselves, now desire to issue to their own subjects a regular document printed in Arabic and English in the form m A ' of which I enclose a copy.

It is expected that the Persian authorities will shortln take drastic action against all Foreign subjects who do not possess passports bearing the obligatory Persian visa for entry into Persia.

Prom Captain O.G-.Prior, I.A., rkr.t.n ^fllifeiai^L RECORDS. Political Agent, Bahrein.' TO The Secretary to the ' Hon'hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. i Sir, I have the liaaour to refer to correspondence ending with your letter Ko.296-3 of the 22nd July 1929, and forward copies of a letter from the Adviser to the Government of Bahrein Ho. 261/15 dated 30th July 1929. The Adviser 1 s letter explains itself hut there are several points irchich call for mention. 2. As regards the documents granted hy mainland Shaildis and Amirs ircho have been empowered to give documents to Persians Resident in their territories, I am writing to tliem and pointing out that the system has 'been abused, and that if the abuse con tinues the concession will be withdrawn. 3. It appears impossible for.a Persian to leave Persia with a British visa for Bahrein on his passport. Either he is pre vented from approaching the British Consulate if it is suspected IT that he desires to obtain one, and if it is found in his passport^ f when ke attempts to board the steamer it is torn out. To escape this, he is obliged to take out an ilm o Khabar to placate the Persians, and either obtain a permit from the Bahrein Government or a British Visa on some other document to show when he wishes to land here. An alternative is to come in a sailing craft and land unobtrusively or else to go to the mainland oL Arabia and hribebribe the Amir or Shaikh or Gustoms Director to give him a pass saying that he is a permanent resident of that place. 4. I do not agree with the Adviser that the situation pre- sents a deadlock ( in fact it jives the Bahrein Crovemment power to exclude Persians unacceptable to them) for I have shown above methods employed for avoiding it, and if British Consulates were to be given some paper by the Bahrein G-ovemment which they could issue to Persians who were persona grata to them, there would be no difficulty to these Persians, as they would not show this document on leaving Persia. This miht, however, provide an add led complication, but you will notice that the Adviser has sugges- i .ted something of this nature. 5. I cannot understand why Persians should be unable to • _ obtain a British visa in Bombay. It is possible that the Jass- port Officer declines to give one unless he sees that it has been &gt; \ endorsed by the Persian Consul for Bombay. If this is the case, the practice should be dropped for the Persian Consul nowadays seizes the opportunity to put 1 Bahrein, Persia T in English and block capitals. As I stated in a recent telegram it appears in credible that the Bombay authorities should still be an aware that a visa is required for Bahrein, and I request that a strongly worded letter be sent them referring to former instructions. I see -gdbs® from my file that the Steamer Agents in Bombay were also warned and they should therefore not issue tickets to any one for Bahrein who has not a British visa. 6. The suggestion that the Bahrein Government should issue passes to the mainland for their nationals and_Persians resident . in the islands is a good one, and I suggest that for the reasons given they should be allowed to do so. I would be glad to receive telegraphic orders, in code if jossible f regarding this point, before I leave Bahrein, and I would also enquire whether the Agency should visa such passes. ^ 7. With regard to your telegram 797 received today, the Bahrein Government state that they had contemplated keeping luQolr.si of passport forms as sent with my letter 387 of the 25th of April A books of 20 or 50 forms with counterfoils. I suggest thatthat they use these for journeys in the G-ulf, and have the same made up into cardboard covers for journeys outside the Gulf. They would then he similar to the old form of British passport, and could 'be produced quite cheaply. k8. The last two paragraphs of the Advisee letter referred to matters which I believe are bein^ dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Po'tnTTcal A^ejit, Bahrein.Ko.261/15 of 1348 Office of tlie Adviser to the G-overinnent, Bahrein. Bated 33rd, Safar 134§ 30th July li£. To ^•3.LI T s Political Ajent, Bahrein. Llemorandum Some misapprehension exists at present on the subjects of passports. The passport rules as regards Persians were imposed for political reasons as the acceptance of a document styling Bahrein as part of Persia is highly de- ro^jatory to the amour-propre of the State of Bahrein# For no 64her reason does the G-ovemment of Bahrein wish to exclude Persians. According to the rules no Persian is admitted without a pass stamped 'by a British Gonsular Official, or a document issued 'by one of certain mainland Shaikhs to genuine Persian residents in their territories. The former rule is not carried out and the latter rule is greatly ahused. / If a Persian obtains a British vise for Bahrein on his passport it is torn out 'by an official at the Persian port of embarkation. Persian passports are now endorsed v/ith the wrds Bahrein, Persia' and in the aim al Khubar, alternative to a passport, the same des cription is used. Persians have told me that they cannot get a / . . O . British vise in Bombay or Karachi, this I fail to under- - stand though it may have been refused on passports which bear the words 'Bahrein, Persia' The result of the regulations is a deadlock. ActuallyActually the Bahrein G-overnmeat would he satisfied with any sort of document as long as it is stamped hy a British Consular Official and does not describe Bahrein as Persia. Uould it he possible for consular officials in Persia to issue something in the nature of an indentification document to Persians wishing to come to Bahrein? The traveller could aiso - obtain an aim al Ihubar or Persian passport but this would not be shown in Bahrein. A different situation has occurred on the mainland, Per sians knowing that they cannot enter Bahrein without passes aBe now flocking to the mainland ports where they obtain passes, at a price, and on them they enter Bahrein. This traffic of pseudo Persian residents on the coast is increasing daily. I suggest that the Shaikhs on the mainland should be asked not to issue passes to any'but genuine residents of two years or more, or if this suggestion does not commend itself, they should be told that as far as we are concerned they need no longer issue passes. The authorities here will endeavour to verify statements of arrivals who claim to be residents of the mainland. Uith regard to issue of outward passports by this Govem. ment. According to your instructions we issue passports to Persia and return, to Bahrein subjects and Persian subjects. Certain Persians are allowed to land here for trade and in some cases for residence at the discretion of the G-ovemment. V»e charge fees for permits and passes and letters of guarantee to cover the expenditure on clerks and passport serviced v Have you any objection to the Bahrein G-ovemment issuing passes to its own nationals and Persians, to the mainland ports? ^ Unless this is done it is impossible to check the entry of un authorised Persians from the mainland who pretend that they belong to Bahrein and have been visiting mainland ports. Unless the passport regulations apply to traffic to and from the mainland the usefullness of the passport regulations as far as native craft is concerned is practically nullified. Theiha passport regulations are a very great assistance in checking the entry of undersirable aliens, criminals and depoft- - ed and repatriated persons, but for effectiveness it is necess- ^ary Lhat they should apply to native craft as well as ships, xiie dregs of the gulf flow down to Bahrein in the diving season and an effective passport system assists public security. Might i suggest that the scope of the Bahrein Govern-* -uent's passport procedure should he enlarged; that it should issue regular passports to its subjects for all gulf ports and for India as is done by the Buler of Najd. Regular passports were drafted and approved of by you. Tenders for the printing have been received, but until I hear from you I am taking no action as regards the printing. -ome tine ago I wrote informing you that H.E. Shaikh '■amad would welcome the suggestion that his Government should ' ' 1 ssue regular passports as was done, I believe, in Shaikh Isa's regime. It would seem very suitable that Bahrein, an independent Arab state should issue its ovm passports to its own subjects for travelling to neighbouring countries. od. ^•Dalrymple Belgrave.

British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 21st August 1929, Sir, J : With reference to my telegram No. 95, dated the 15th instant, I have the honour to submit for your informa tion a translation of a petition dated 14th Safar 1348 from Hamaid al HaJ Ahood al Usfoor, a Bahrain! residing in Mohemmerah, to the Shaikh of Bahrain. w 2» It strikes the residents of Bahrain as remarkable that *hile Britain's protection of th4ir island runs to dethroning their ruler, sarrying out a series of reforms and arranging to establish flying boat and aeroplane bases for herself, it is not of the least value in alleviating # the lot of Baharaneh in Persia. The deadlock over the Persian claim to Bahrain and the delay in settling it and the Tanb episode of last year are undoubtedly having a bad effect on the Trucial Coast Shaikhs, always jealous of European penetration. 3 # I am finding the greatest difficulty in persuad ing the Shaikh of Ras al iChaimah to consent to the establish* ment of a re-fuelling station for flying boats at his capital. He and his fellow Shaikhs think that we sacrifice their interests to ours, and so the less they have to do with us the better for themselves. 4.

Somt of thtm possess dociununts from the Consulate of * Mohcumnerah. In former days whenever we had any difficulty at the hands of the Persian Governor, we used to approach the Br. Consulate, which used to afford us every assistance. When the Persian Government came to power in our country they have cornmenccd giving us endless trouble and now when we go to the Br. Consulate we do not receive as much help as before. About 5 years ago, the Persian Govt, refused to visa our passports. Vnen any oi us wanted to go to Basrah we were taking a passport from the Br, Consulate and from the Persian Govt., a Tashkara. And there was no trouble. Hoy / if any of us want to travel we take a passport and go to the Police station to take an Ilmokhabar for the purpose, they refuse to give. They ask us to bring a surety to execute a sanad binding that if the holder went beyond Iraq, he will have to forfeit 20,000 Krans. Besides, these days, they will not allow any one to go out of Mohammerah and they will not let the dead to be buried unless they have what they call ,, Sujal Ahiiawal M - a document showing the identity of the person. We approached the Br, Consulate in Mohammerah and we got reply asking us to inform the Bahrain Govt, and that they will perhaps help us like the Iraq Govt, who protect their nationals in foreign country, because our Govt, has more authority on us. We ask you to assist us as other countries do, so that we can carry on our business in peace. The Iraq subjects in Mohammerah number 150 and the Consulate will look after their interests. ButBut the Bahranis who £.r« re Biding in lxOharmn«rftii and adjacent places numbtr about 12,000 and for every trouble visitirig then they inform the Consulate but ^ill not get redress.

Mrcsmuably a J ersian holding a passport vise 'Bahrain, PerBla 1 * without a British V endorsement would be refused entry into Bahrain, and the same would happen in the case of a holder of an ilm-o- Khabar, who was so foolish as to show it to the Bahrain ''assport authorities. The mere reiteration of an absurA claim does not make it any less absurd. 3. Although it is not for us to make suggestions, it is quite feasible for a Persian to find a way round his country's passport regulations should he so desire. He may obtain an ilm-o-khabar to placate tiic Persians but not show^to the Bahrain authorities, vii ile in order to secure unrestricted landing at Bahrain :ic may liave provided himsu^ witiri a permit from the Htate.

If the Bahrain Goverm/ient have no objection to the unrestricted entry of Persians but are nerely desirous of refusing recognition of the llm-o-ichabar, they will not object to \he action of Arab nhaikha in passing J 'ersians through Arab ports, but if, for reasons of their ovm, they wish to restrict entry, It is for theia to take laeasures of control, as they see fit. I 1 no reason why the Bahrain Oovernnent should not issue passes to the Mainland for their nationals and ernians reb I dent in the Islands, as there io no local J'eri ian Conoul. It would be better that th*; ^'^-ncy u^io ild not visa such passes as this appears to be a matter in which Hie Majeoty's Ooverniaent is not concerned. Similarly Uiere would apjiear to be no reason why the Bahrain Govemrnent should not cend Persians resident in Bombay, whoa they wish to admit into Bahrain, a special • permit. I am prepared to ask the rhi^lng CompanieB to recognise this permit, ftr the State will eend me uorae samples for distribution. It would be preferable that this document should not specify the holder's nationality. It is not how^ ever feasible for Britinh Consulates to be supplied with paper by the Bahrain Government for issue to Hersiana who are persona grata with the Hahrain Government. 7 * Jn any event, however. If the action of the Persian authorities makes It difficult for their nationals toto vie it Bahrain it does not appear incumbent on tha Bahrain authorities to help theia out of their difricultice unless Persian Irmigrants are required for economic reasons* '^hc question of the issue 'by the .Bahrain Govern- ment of regular passports for all Gulf ports and for places abroad is under con side rati on, ana X anticipate it will be settled in accordance with the wishes of the Bahrain Govern- ^ ment^ The pauaport formo onclooed in your letter Mo. 3C7 oi Sfith April 1(&gt;29 uight well be used for Journeys within th® Oulf # but for the outer world something more approaching the British ^aus^ort, witli any necessary motfifi- cations, would appear more appropriate. i \ 7^ Lieut.-Colonel, Political 'esident in Uie Persian Gulf. iTcie£;r4iin From To Mo.
