The Sultan was absent in India at the clese ef the year 1934 and returned te Muscat en 6th February, in March he paid a visit in H.M.S. Shereham t# hhasab and Jazirat-al~ Ghanam where he Inspected the site of the prepesed haval Kecreatlen station at Mher ^uwai. In ^pril he proceeded to Gwadur and after a brief trip to Karachi and back left in H.M.3. Lupin for bur, where he stayed some six days, ^hile at 3ur dla Highness received a farewell visit from the retiring denier haval officer, i^ersian Gulf, captain *i.V. Creagh, u.5.0. The presence of the two warships at bur is reported to have had an excellent effect on the unruly inhabitants of what was formerly a troublesome port ana to have resulted in an appreciable increase of the Gultan’s authority in that district. In July His highness travelled by sea to Goh&amp;r where the date cultivators petitioned him to grant a reduc tion in the rate of Jakat ^an excise tax levied at source on certain produce of the country). The dultan promised to reduce the tax but the Director of revenues who visited the Hatineh in December refused to accept any reduction. Most of the cultivators on their part, as a protest,refused to pay the ^akat unless it was taken in kind enly. The matter was referred te His Highness whose decision was still awaited at the end of the year. The Gultan returned to Muscat overland on 11th «%ugust. Ho sailed for India en 31st august to undergo an X-ray examination for some internal trouble which he nab apparently developed during his last visit te the Hatineh. He returned te Muscat on 2nd October. The report of the medicalmedical examination waa favourable f nothing aerious having been found. on 12th October His Highness proceeded to iJhefar^by a steamer of the Moghul Line steamship Company which waa chartered for the voyage. He was accompanied by some fifty of his followers including Khan Bahadur Ahmad whubailly his secretary, who had travelled up by the same ship from India, tfhen leaving Muscat His Highness announced his intention of returning in i.pril and arrangements, at his request, were made for a Tanker of the Anglo-iranian Oil Company to call in for him, but he has since written to say that he intends to stay on in uhofar until the autumn. it appears as if nis Highnesses inclination is to SACyi'et follow in the footsteps of his father, oaiti Taimur, and somewhat neglect the affairs of his State and devote most of his time to personal amysements. he is engaged in re building and decorating his house in jalalah where he ti^a just installed electric lighting and refrigeration. His Highness’s time in Jihofar is chiefly occupied i** carrying out improvements to his house and personal property, proceed ing on hunting expeditions in the near neighbourhood, experi ments in cultivation and generally in the pursuits el a country gentleman. Many riding horses, motor cars, cinema and radio installation and a Court «feater, all taken down from Muscat, complete the amenities of life in hhofar. The vast majority the inhabitants of Muscat and uman are so poverty stricken and occupied with earning their daily pittance that the prolonged absence of their dultan means nothing to them. The small comparatively well to do community are exclusively engaged in trade and interested in nothing else. Heal resentment and aiscontent at the dultan’s neglect of his capital and his government i* confined to the Kuling Family whose dislikes and jealousies amongstamongst themstlves, however, prevent them frem eflectiveiy combining to undermine the Multan's authority, a measure which they are all desirous of accomplishing. It is rumoured that the Spltan recently withdrew Rs. 2,00,000 from the ^tate Funds in the Bank at Bombay to cover part of his expenses while at Salalah* This act is greatly resented by the Killing Family who consider the money belongs to the Btate and is not for the personal use of the Buitan. (b) Baiyid Hamad bin Faisal , one of His Highness’s uncles who had held the post of the Wall of M&amp;trah since he was removed from the governorship of ^ohar in 1930, was relieved of his duties when he returned from India in August on the pretext of his ill health. The real cause of his uiscnarge was that His highness had received numerous complaints of his neglect of his duties and his ill-treatment of people. U&gt; aaiyid Mahmud bin Mohammad bin Turk!, a cousin ef His Highness was appointed and continues to be the Wall of Matr&amp;h. (d) Sajyid Nadir , the senior uncle of His Highness,has, as in the past, maintained friendly relations with the Sheikhs and the Imam of uman, with whom he maintains a constant correspondence. He refuses to take any interest in State affairs owing to his continuing to nurse a grievance over the reduction made in his allowance in 1933 (e) Saiyid Bhahab bin Faisal , the favourite uncle of His Highness, represented the aultan whenever he was absent from the capital. He has shown himself to be a capable and strong administrator anu appears to be genuinely interested in his work. To the somewhat limited extent of the authority delegated to him he has always been willing to co-operate with the agency and is invariably pleasant10 . pleasant and friendly to deal with. 2. Financial Adviser . The director ef Hevenues remained practically in charge of financial affairs of the State throughout thi year though the control of the finances was nominally in the hands of His Highness. 3. state Finances . The epening balance at ttit commencement oi the year showed a credit of ^s. 2 1 73j433/3/**. iiiib ±iguiCj however, excludes debts due by tlie State to local creditor! which amount to to 72,000. Compared with last year an increase of to* 1,07,626/7/- is shown. This financial position can, for muscat, be described as distinctly satisfactory. The chief causes contributing to this result were U) continued effect of the reduction in the Civil List and other economies made in 1233, i2) increase in the import trade and (3) increased yield in the Customs duties which were raised in 1234. The Arms Traffic subsidy was continued for 1236 on the informal understanding made with the Sultan by means of a “Gentleman’s agreement” that the whele amount should be expended on social services and improvements to the state. t% number of schemes were drawn up by the sultan in consultation with the political Agent but owing to the prolonged absence of the former from the capital several of these have yet to be started. Certain meaaires, however, for the improvement of the to ,/ns of muac&amp;t and Matrah which the Sultan requested the political Agent to undertake en his behalf have been proceeded with and tnese are described elsewhere in the Hepert. 4. Increase of Import Suty. In June the customs duty on liquors containin* 60A11 . 60% Under ^roof alcehal or atroiiger was raised te 20^ and the fallowing articles were added to the 10% duty list; Tobacco, 6nuff, Cigarette raper, dirt leaves, Cigarette cases, Oils of all kinds - mineral, Vegetable and animal including all kinds of imported Ghee and Fats, Boots and Choes, Cement, Confectionary, Provisions and Groceries, Glass and Glass-ware - Glass Bangles, Beads, artificial Pearls and Ornaments, Gold and silver Thread (Jari), Gold and diiver-wares of all kinds, Methylated spirits, Motor Cars, Cycles ^Motor and Power) and their parts and accessories, onions, Photographic materials, Playing Caras and Game requisites, dewing Machines, Furniture and Cabinetware, Jaggery and Molasses, earthen ware ana Porcelain. , 6. Muscat and Matrah Improvement dcheme . at the request of the dultan shortly before his departure for Dhofar the Political Agent undertook the execution of certain measures for the improvement of the towns of Muscat and katrah. i*s certain of these projects were of a technical nature the Political Agent proceeded to Karachi in October where valuable aavice and assistance were freely given by the chairman ox une Karachi roit xru^L and the Chief Engineer to the Public Works Department of Sind. Plans and dravfings for the builuings required for slaughter houses, fish and meat mai'kets and incinerators were put in hand by the Drawing office oi the Chief Engineer^ Office and have been promised for the early part of 1936. The sites for the above mentioned build ings were chosen and the ground cleared before the end of the year and in November the preliminary work was started on cleaning up the notorious Muscat *Pond rt on a scheme suggeste&lt;^^the Karachi Port ‘‘•rust authority.

As mentioned in last year ! s report, the Political Agent at the request of the Sultan under took the execution of certain measures for the improve ment of the towns of Muscat and Matrah. During the period unaer review, the filling and draining of the notorious Muscat 'Pond a pestilential swampy area of about two acres and a proli- fic breeding ground for malarial mosquitoes were completed and a number of trees planted tnerein. The latest type fish and meat markets and slaughter houses well constructed of stone;! and ferro-concrete were completed in both the towns of Muscat and Matrah. The buildings were handed over to the State in August but up to the end of the year no attempt had been made to use them the curious reason given for which beingbeing that the Municipality in neitner town had sufiicient funds to keep them clean. The Sultan* s return is await to make some suitable arrangement for this purpose. 6 . iiNMTo IN OhAN. Nothing of importance took place during the year T As reported last year, discontent continued to exist over the excessive assessment made for the purposes of taxation on dry dates sent to Sur for export to India. At the beginning of the year, it was reported that Sheikh Mohammad bin Abdullah, the Imam of Oman under pressure from the Hijriyin and Hardh tribes had written to His Highness at Dhofar requesting him to reduce the rate of Zakat at Sur to the level of other places in Oman vizj 5$ on the value of the dates exported, instead of dollars per load collected at the time. This rate amounted to over 20% of the average value of the produce delivered at Sur. Under the terms of the treaty concluded between the Omanis and the Muscat Government in 1920 it was agreed that the duty on dates brought down from the Oman for export should not exceed b% ad-valorum. No satisfactory reply to this communication is Slid to have been received. As the Omanis saw that the Sultan was not taking any notice of their complaints, this year they refused to send any of their dry dates to Sur and were considering making an agreement with the Sheikh of Bani-Bu-Ali tribe whose district is called Ja»lan near Sur to open a new port in his territoiy. At the oa.me time Sheikh Hamad bin Sulaiman, son-in-law oi Gheixh Isa bin Salih, the right hand man of the Imam oi Oman visited Muscat in August to discuss the matter with the Sultan’s Representative. The latter after consulting the Political Agent issued orders, in anticipation of the Sultan’s g approval, reducing the rate to j dollar per load or approximatelyapproximately 5 % ad-valorum. This action has settled situation which at one time threatened to become serious^, 7.

An event of some importance took place in October when Shaikh *Isa bin Salih with his &amp; soni. and. i suiall band of followers paid a semi-official visit to the Multan. Shaikh is the right hand man of the Imam of the Oman and has probably more influence and authority in that district than the Imam himself. It was Shaikh wno as a young man was the leader of the Qisan forces in their abortive attack on Muscat in +9i&amp; which was repelled by Indian troops then stationed here &amp;nu since truat period he has never visited the capital agc»in. According to the Sultanas siciteasents, which appear nave some degree of truth in them, Shaikh T I .a*s Vj.sitwas suggested by the latter himself and his object was to make his peace with the Muscat Government on account of his dissatisfaction with the rule of the Imam. A more likely reason, as has been reported, is that the financial condition of the Imam is not very prosperous owing to a serious decline in his revenues consequent upon the heavy fall in the price of dates, on the export of which the prosperity of the Oman almost entirely depends. The news of the oil concession recently granted by the Sultan to Petroleum Concessions Limited has, it is believed, penetrated throughout the State and it is quite probable that Shaikh ♦Isa^s visit was connected with the object of sharing in the spoils the extent of which has no doubt been exaggerated in proportion to the distance the news has travelled. Though the Sultan denied that any oil matters were referred to by Shaikh f Isa the latter did not altogether fail in what was in all probability the real reason of his trip from the interior - financial assistance - as the Sultan admitted ruefully that the visit which lasted less than a w T eek, cost him in presents and entertainment well over Rs.4000/-. At this price the Sultan declared he preferred not to have further visits from Shaikh f Isa for some years to come. That the situation in the Oman is in a state of flux appears fairly certain but whether this visit of the leading personage therein to the excommuni cated nominal Ruler of the country means the beginning of the break up of the Imam»s authority and control over tne tribes of the interior, which the Sultan has declared in so many words he believes to be happening, s another more dubious matter and which time alone will clear up. (b) The 1891 Treaty of Commerce, Friendship and Navigation between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan was renewed on its due date 11th February. In/6 ./ - 4 - •'— ■ 3 '- In March thfe Sultan in accordance with Article i:3 of the Treaty gave notice of hie desire to revise the Treaty and the Political Agent was appointed to act as negotiator on behalf of His Majesty*s Govern ment. Alter a number of discussions the Sultan^ draft for the revised Treaty was completed and in October forwarded to the Political Resident for subn.ission to His Majesty’s Government, The Sultan has put forward many important proposals In his draft Treaty In which complete fiscal I and tariix autonomy is claimed. The important privilege of extra territoriality enjoyed by British subjects under the existing Treaty is, however, left untouched in the new Treaty. 5. OIL CONChlLIPN . In June the Sultan with the approval of His Majesty’s Government commenced negotiations for in Oil Concession for his State with petroleum Concessions Limited, a company principally British in composition, whose registered oiiice is in London. After less tnen c weeks negotiations which is probably a record for celer ity in such a matter and which was due in considerable measure to the ability and skill of the negotiator repre senting the Company, Mr.B.J.Lermith, the Sultan signed an agreement giving the exclusive right to prospect for and exploit oil in his Arabian territories to Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Concession was in two Parts (a) lor the Province of Dhofar and (b) for the remainder of the Arabian territory of the .Sultanate. The enclave of Gwadur, a small dependency of Muscat State situated on the coast of British Baluch istan, was not included in the above Concessions since the Company were not interested in and consequently did not apply for this area.9./ 6.

EQ1AL AIR FORCE . (a) The establishment of the Royal Air Force in Muscat, consisting of a Rest House and Wireless Station, which is in direct communication with Shaiba (Basra) and Bhiban Olr&amp;q), was maintained in charge ot three operators up to June, and thereafter increased to four* (b) A tragic event which caused the loss of three lives of members of the Royal Air Force occurred in the first week of November when a machine ox a detachment of 34 bquadrfcn from Basra on a reconnaissance flight of the landing grounds between Basra and Aden crashed at Khur Gharim some 400 miles south of Muscat and all '6 occupants were killed. One of these was ^ing Commander Richards, who had recently been appointed the first Liaison Officer between the Royal Air Force and the Political authorities In the Gulf, This Officer in addition to having had a distinguished record in his own profession had become well kno?»n in Muscat during numerous visits in previous years in connection with Royal Air Force affairs and by his tact, ability and sympathetic understanding of Arab ways had become universally liked and respected by all with whom he had come in contact in the State, The news of his death was received with genuine regret. A noteworthy feature arising out of this sad accident was the attitude of the local inhabitants during the period the other machines ol the Flight * ere standing by until relief aircraft arrived. The neigh bourhood of Khur Gharim is in perhaps one of the wildest and most lawless districts of the ft&amp;te where th© authority of the Muscat Goverrufiunt is treated with scanty respect. Though the behaviour of some oi the tribesmen who appeared quickly on the scene alter t.ue disaster/- 7 - disaster when faced with such a wonderful opportunity ox loot was not blameless, and, in fact, but for the marked tact and skilful handling of what at times must have been a delicate situation by the two Non Commission- ; ed Officers of the remaining machines of the Flight, the general attitude 01 the local Bedu was not unfriendly and their conduct certainly not as dangerous as their reputation would lead to suspect. 10. AVIATION GENERAL . The annual special authorisation for aircraft to land and fly over Muscat and Oman required by the Civil Air Agreement entered into between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan in iy34 was renewed on the 2nd January. The Civil aerodrome at Gwadur continued to be used through out the year by the bi-weekly East and West services main tained by imperial /arways. 14 machines of Air France and 3 of the Dutch A.L.M. landed for refuelling under the * special authorisation for tnese companies granted annually * by the Sultan. A number of private aircraft also landed here in the course of the year and a few machines of the Royal jiir Force on flights between Iraq and India and vice- versa. in September one land plane service was withdrawn and its place ta^en by one of the new Flying Boats of the type to be employed under the proposed Empire Air Mail Scheme. 11. FQRFIGN INTERESTS . (a) The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. At the request of the Consul for France at Bombay a few repairs to the Consulate building were (b)/ attached to this Agency.(b) American interests remained in the nands, of the Political Agent during the year, Ik.

(a) ^ls Highness Salyici Said bin Talrnur . After a prolonged absence of nearly a year and a half in the province of Dhofar in the extreme south of the Sultanate His Highness returned to Muscat in the third week: of February. In the latter half of June he left for a short holiday in India. After visiting Karachi, Baluchistan, Kashmere and Bombay the Sultan returned to Muscat in the last week of August. The Sultan left Muscat on November 8th in H.i.S. Enterprise for Karachi en route to Delhi on an official visit to His Excellency the Viceroy. Accompanying the Sultan were Saiyid Hamad bln Faisal, his uncle, laiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, his cousin, and Hilal bin bacir, Secretary. On dis embarkation at Karachi on November 10th the Sultan was met by the Collector of Karachi representing the Sind Government, the Brigadier General Commanding the Sind Independent Brigade ana a Guard of Honour furnished by the Royal vest Kent Regiment. as his Highness disembarked a salute of LI guns vas fired by H.M.S,Enterprise. On 11th November the Sultan left by rail lor Delhi in a special saloon provided for him by the Govern ment of India. At New Delhi Station the Sultan was met by Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, the Military Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, the Deputy Commissioner of Delhi, the Under Secretary to tne Government of India in the External Affairs Department and an Aide de Camp^ to His Excellency t Viceroy. Afaer inspecting tne Guard of ,:onour provided at the station, the Sultan accompanied by his suite ant. Sir Aubrey/Aubra/ ietcaile drove in procession to the Viceroy’s House ,Ch where he was received informally by His Excellency. The tultan dixi nis party stayed at the Viceroy’s Hou.*.e until the 16th after which they were the guests of the Government of India/ at Maiden’s Hotel, Delhi* The Sultan was accorded an official Intervi ;» with His Excellency on November 16th and on Novemor iSth ith the Secretary in the External Affairs Department at which various matters were discussed. These interviews have been reported on separately. For the Sultan’s stay in Delhi the Government of India had arranged a varied and comprehensive programme of sight seeing anc. demonstrations of dif erent sorts. r a-- v»( 2 re all genuinely enjoyed and appreciated by His J ighness. Perhaps the object of the greatest interest to the Sultan was his visit to the Imperial Agricultural Institute and certainly the greatest thrill he experienced was the demonstration by the Delhi Flying Club at an At Home given in his '/ honour and his night flight over Delhi in a machine of Indian Airways. The Sultan and suite left Delhi in a special railway saloon provided by the Government of India for Bombay on November hind. The Sultan’s official visit (the first ne has paid to India) can be described as a great suae** success, ihanks to the excellent arrangements made by the various departments concerned everything want off without a hitch and His Highness it seems was genuinely impressed .Is.i ment he received and grateful for/the trouble taken to ensure his comfort an.i amusement. On 50th November the Sultan leit Bombay via Singapore for Japan where he Inlands to stay about one :i.onth with his father, Saiyld Taimur bin Faisal, late Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who has settled down in that country and is living at present at Kobe, From Japan the Sultan proposes to proceed to a a. „ ^ ArTtn-Mra where his visit to Washington the United States of America wnere* &lt; 5 ^ wl u be Official and where he will be the guest of Resident ^ cosevelt.

Bo far back as the early part &gt;f 19.5 a King's Kegulation(No. 1 of 1935) had been issued announcing that conditional uron the prior approval of the Political Resident Muscat Government Municipal Taxes could oe imposed on those persons subject to the Muscat Order in Council of 1915. On publication of this King's Regulation the Muse t Government were requested to form proper Municipalities for the towns oi Muscat and Mat rah and to draft up a scheme of Municipal taxation for trie approval of the Political Resident. Qvving principally to the prolonged absence of the bultan for nearly a year and a half in a remote and inaccessible part oi his dominions and also to the inability of the State officials to draw up a suitable scheme of taxation no progress was made in the matter until His Highness's r turn to the Capital early in the year. Owing to the lack of experience and nroper organization in the State Administration it tas found impossible to work out the usual form of municipal taxation and a proposal then was/put forward by the Bultan and ultimately agreed to by the Political Resident to impose a tax of one anna oer package on all goods imported from abroad. A further delay prolonged by the Sultan's absence in India ensued in forming an approved Municipality as required by the political Resident but this v/ss eventually accomplished in November and the Political ^gent was authorized to issue a Notification making the tax, when formally announced by the Muscat Government, applicable to British subjects. At the close of the year the publication of the tax by the Muscat Government was still being awaited.V'ith t&gt; r forrption of a proper Munici-allty provided with adeouate funds which the ne^ tax is expected to provide there beems a hope of some rceasures for the soiely neeueu sanitation of Muscat and Vatrah being put into effect at lonfc last.

As previously the Report has been divided into Parts I and II, the former dealing v^ith British interests and European and American affairs, whilst the latter treats of State matters and those in which His Majesty’s Government and the State have joint c oncern. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Political Agent &amp; H.B.M^ Consul, MuscatThe Quarantine station is in a bad state of ^ repairs but His Highness the Sultan has proitised to have the necessary worJc put in hand early next year. 3* iPhlTICAh SITUATION iiie roxitical Situation remained quiet and without incident tnroughout the year. The Sultan steadfastly pursued his policy of endeavouring to increase by peaceful means his influence and authority over the interior of the country in general and the Omrn in particular. -tosumption of the Muscat Government 1 s control over the Oman is probably the great ambition ofthe Sultan* life. The method adopted has been to get into touch with various SheiKhs and Leading men of those districts of the State bordering the Oman proper who if not directly under the control of the Imam have hitherto been certainly more influenced by him than by the Sultan. In August Sheikh Kohsin bin Zahran of the Siyabi Tribe, in September Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammad of the Tal Hibi and in October Sheikh Ahmad bin Mohammad al Yahyayi of the Aahra were the more important of the Tribal Sheikhs who visited the Sultan in Muscat and after being sump tuously entertained were sent back laden with substantial presents. The biggest success achieved by the Sultan in this connection was in being able to persuade the Head of the Beni Bu Ali Tribe to come in to Muscat in the first week of October. This notorious tribe, which provides some of the best fighting material to be found anywhere in the State, occupies a peculiar position in that it is subservient neither to the Imam of Oman nor to the Sultan. It has, in fact, for many years enjoyedvirtual independence. A portion of Sur, the largeeY town and port in the State belongs to the Tribe and their position here and on the flank of the main trade route between the Oman and the coast together with the warlike qualities of the tribe make them one of the most formidable and strongest factors in State politics Sheikh Ali who was accompanied by forty followers stayed some^weeics in Muscat where he was treated as a very honoured guest of the Sultan. The expenses of his visit are believed to be not less than r&lt;s 14000 which amount, to a State in the poor financial position of Muscat, is a not inconsiderable sum. The Sultan has in fact being buying the good wili of the tribes of the interior and the only means which have enabled him to adopt this policy is the comparatively large sums he received from Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in 1937 in return for his grant to them of an oil exploratory concession in Muscat and Dhofar. The further success of this plan will in all probability depend on the result of the search for oil in the State. Should this be successful and a steady source of income be assured to the Sultan, provided he continues to feel his way cautiously, as he has hither to done, it would not be by any means outside the bounds of possibility that Saiyid Said will be the first of his dynasty since its famous founder of the same name to be the real ruler of the whole of his Sultanate. (b) The 1691 Treaty of Commerce, Friendship, and Navigation between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan was renewed for the last time on its due date i.e. February 11th. Negotiations for the New Treaty, to replace that of 1891, which had been commenced in Muscat and Indiain were carried to tneir closing stagesin London during His Highness* visit to England in the autumn of 1938* The iew remaining points requiring amendments and corrections were agreed upon between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan at the end of the year and the Treaty in its final form was ready in December for signature which is to be carried out early in the new year* 4. oil coivcaasiofls . ( a ) Muscat Oii &gt;- Petroleum Concessions Ltd*, who had obtained an oil concession in the Arabian territories of the Sultanate and in the Province of Dhofar commenced explorations in the last quarter of the year. On the 18th October Mr. S.H.Longrigg, General Manager arrived in Muscat to maJce arrangements for a party of geologists of his Company to carry out a survey. He had several discussions with His Highness in which details of the journies to be made by land and by air were discussed* Mr. Longrigg left for Bahrain on the 5th November. Mr. Thompson and Mr. HotchJciss, geologists of the Company arrived on 1st November. K.S.Hasan Mohammad Saleh of Aden, Interpreter having arrived a weex earlier. The geological party left Muscat on 4th November by motor boat for Khabura whence they carried out a journey into the interior visiting Yanqul, Hafit and Baraimi and returning to Muscat on 4th December. The attitude of the SheiJchs and tribes of the districts traversed, with minor exceptions, was friendly and helpful. According to unofficial information receivedfrom the Senior Geologist, the result of the explorations of the country towards the west of toe Sultanate was disappointing as far as the districts oi Yi»nqul, Hafit and Baraimi were concerned but it was said that the regions between those places and the coast were worthy of further examination. The Geological party left for Hass al Hadd by n;otor liiow on the 18th. December where they were met by the Company’s aeroplane which had flown out from England a few days previously. Aerial surveys over a period of four days were carried out over the interior. They returned on the 25th December V having abandoned their original intention of pro- cceding with the reconnaissances to the south for the reason that the motor dhow hired as a tender vessel was unsuitable for the purpose. It was then decided to arrange for passing Tanicers to carry out the wo pk of moving personnel and stores from one base camp to another. On 26th December the Company’s aeroplane arrived in Muscat and on 27th December made a two hours flight over the interior. The same day Mr. HotchEiss, the geologist, Mr. Barnes, Mechanic, and K.S.Hasan bin Saleh, Interpreter left for Sharjah by slow mail, and Mr. Thompson, Senior Geologist and Mr. Eden, Photographer followed by aeroplane the next day for the purpose of consulting the Local General Manager in regard to future plans. It is proposed to carry out aerial surveys in the province of Dhofar early next year. ^ (k) Gwadur Oil :- Two rival Companies namely Burmah Shell and Indian Oil Concessions are nego tiating with His Highness the Sultan to obtain oil concession in the Gwadur Enclave of the Muscat State.

Dr. (Miss) Hoem&amp;n attached to the women’s Hospital of the Mission at Muscat made several tours of the Batinah Coast during the year for treatment of the sick as she has done for several years past. The entire staff of the Mission left Muscat for India on recess during the summer months. 11. SoAV-l TRaDM .

RULING FAMILY. (a) Hie Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur. During 1938 His Highness carried out a world tour which he had commenced with hie official visit to India at the end of 1937. Leaving India in November 1937 the Sultan travelled via Singapore to Japan where he visited his father Saiyid Taimur, the late Sultan, who has settled permanently at Kobe. The Sultan's visit to Japan was private and apparently no discussions took place between him and any Japanese officials. After a stay of just over a month in that country the Sultan left in the end of January for the United States disembarking at San Francisco on 15th February. After visiting various places of interest including Hollywood - a most important place in the eyes of the Sultan who is a keen critic of the cinema - His Highness arrived in Washington on 10th March where he was the guest of the United States Government for some days and had an interview with President Roosevelt. On 28th March His Highness arrived in England where he was a guest of His Majesty's Government for the first fortnight of his stay. b'!,« The Sultan was granted an audience with His Majesty the King who conferred on him the title of K.C.I.F*. There seems no doubt that the Sultan thoroughly enjoyed and was appreciative of the varied and comprehensive programme of entertainment arranged forhim by the Government Hospitality Board and his visit to England can be described as a distinct success. Since his return to Muscat the Sultan has several times stated hoe much he enjoyed himself in that country and how sorry he was that his visit could hot have been considerably longer. After a short visit of some two weeks to France in April,where he was received by the President the French Republic, His Highness returned to England on 19th April and left on 1st May via Italy and India for Muscat, which he eventually reached on 13th July 1938. (b) Saiyid Nadir, the senior member of the ruling family, as in the past, did not take any part in Jtate affairs and due to his poor state of health lived practically a retired life. At the and of the year he was obliged to go to India for medical treatment and after two months stay in Bombay he returned to Muscat at the close of the year. (c) Saiyid Shahab, who is a real uncle of the Sultan, acted on various occasions during the year as the later*s representative during the Sultan*s absence from the State. (d) Saiyid Hamad, remained Wali of Matrah throughout the year. (e) Saiyid Mahmud, who had been unemployed since his dismissal from the post of Wali of Matrah in February last year secretly left for Zanzibar in a sailing boat in the first week of February. He was accompanied by hie two brothers Khalid and Said. After being ship wrecked off Ras-al-Had, the party arranged to make their way to Socotra, where it is believed they are still living. The Sultan received an insolent letter from Saiyid Mahmud written from Socotra in which he declares the reason forhe and his brothers leaving the State was the unfair treatment received from the Sultan. This statement has no foundation of truth and the State will not be the loser by the departure of these three individuals. (f) Saiyid Tariq, half brother of the Sultan who arrived at Muscat at the close of last year, accompanied His Highness on his tour as far as Japan in order to visit his father, Saiyid Taimur, the former Sultan whom he had not seen since he was a child. P. FINANCIAL ADVISER. The post of Financial Adviser remained vacant throughout the year. 3. TRADE AfG) JOMMSRGB. This subject has already been dealt with in Part X of this report. 4. MUNICIPAL TAXATION* In 1935 a King’s Regulation had been issued by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf making applicable to British Subjects, with his previous approval, rules and taxes imposed by the Muscat Government on their own subjects for the conservancy of the towns of Matrah and Muscat. On account of continued delays and procrastination on the part of the Muscat ^tate Officials the conditions required by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for hie approval of the siiggeeted taxes were not fulfilled until March of 1938 in which month the Political Agent was authorised to make applicable to British Subjects a Muscat Municipal Regulation issued that year imposing a tax of one anna per package on goods / liable tou (Tvs) u liable to Cue tome Duty Imported from abroad. The object of the tax wag to provide funds for the badly needed conservancy of the towns of Muscat and Mutrah. A Municipality has been formed made up of six Muscat subjects and three British subjects nominated by the Political 4gent and presided over by Saiyid Hillal bin Bedr, formerly Secretary to the Sultan. During the last quarter of the year some funds having become available from the tax mentioned above, the Municipality at last commenced to function and a certain amount of activity in clearing up some of the numerous ruins, clearing and lighting of the streets etc. is to be seen in Muscat and Matrah, though the task ahead of the Municipality is a formidable one. 5. KVKBTS IH OMAff. Nothing of importance took place during the year. 6 . QKNfcRAL COMMUMICATXOMB. Mr. C. Cilby remained incharge of the local office of the Cable and Wireless Limited throughout the year. During the greater part of July and August and again in December telegraphic coraraunlcatior-S with the outside world was interrupted owing to the breakdown in the Company^ cables. 7. MUSCAT IffFAHTRY. Captain A.C. Byard, British Array retired, was in command up to 31st July on which date his services were terminated and he left for England. The Sultan has t asked for the services on deputation of an Indian Officer on the Active List of the Indian Army to take over the / commandoi) command of tne iev/ ana it is ho^ecl that a suits^le officer may be made available in the near future, for this purpose. 8 . STATE FINANCES- The Muscat Government no longer supply miormation re^^rding the financial position of the ~'tnte at the end of the year but from inquiries made it may be safely assumed that it is solvent. It is understood that on this date the credit balance of the State amounted to 248,000. This does not include the debts due by the State to the local creditors which amount to * 71,974.

There was an epidemic of Typhoid Fever on the Batinah Coast during the hot season. Measles, Chicken Pox and Whooping-cough have been prevalent during the year in Muscat and Matrah. Without a public health system it is not possible to isolate and control infectious diseases. (b) . Agency Hospital * As an experiment it was decided to make all treat ment in the ,f Out Patient 11 department free and to appeal to the public at the close of the year to meet the additional cost of drugs. An appeal was made by the Political Agent in November and was generously responded to, Rs. 2,620 being subscribed. Owing to the American Mission Hospital at Matrah being closed for six months the work at the Agency Hospital increased* The Hospital has been thoroughly overhauled. Re-inforced concrete floors have been laid in all theupstairs wards. The veranda along the north side has been provided with a roof and sun shades have been placed over the windows in the west end of the building. The inside of the ouilding nas been repainted and the stone work outside re- pointed. Attendances and admittances during the year were as follows 'Out Patient' department - 21,363 persons. Admitted into the Hospital . U6 persons. Major or minor operations performed - 352 Maternity Cases _ Gynaecological cases . (c). quarantine . No quarantine restrictions were imposed at Muscat during the year. No cases of infectious diseases were landed from ships. Dhows however arrive without warning and are not inspected. They are a source of danger. Extensive repairs have been carried out by the State to the Quarantine Station. The two sheds have been improved and the wells cleaned and repaired. 3. POLITICAL SITUATION . (a) . General . The year has been one of the most peaceful that the country has known for some time. There have been no major or minor outbreaks of disaffection. The tribes of Oman have been at peace with each other and with the Sultan’s Government. The Batinah Coast has known no disorders and the usually disturbed area in the vicinity of Sur has, thanks to the able administra tion of the Sultan’s Governor at Sur, Saud bin Ali bin Badr, UK been ^usually free from tribal disturbances. (b) . Oman . The Sultan has continued his policy of endeavouring / to re- jvto re-establish hie control over Oman by peaceful means. It is aifi icult to measure the success of his efforts but it is clear that his relations with the two principal tribal leaders of Oman, sheikh Isa bin Saleh of the Sharqiah and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhd&amp;r, have much improved. He has had amiable personal correspondence with both these Sheikhs and in August the latter extended an invitation to the Sultan’s half brother, ^aiyid Tariq bin Taimur, to visit his area. This invitation was accepted but unfortunately the outbreak of the war made it necessary to postpone the visit. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh has informed the Sultan that he accepts his invitation to visit Muscat for medical treatment and I have no doubt that, provided no complications occur, this influential Sheikh will shortly come to Muscat* Some important political appointments have been made such as that of Sheikh Nasir bin Rashid Kharusi, a brother of the late Imam of Oman, to be Qadi of Suwaiq. The Sultan’s relations with the Imam remain unaltered. The Sultan considers that the Imam Is a man of high principle and of excellent character but there has been no personal contact between them although if relations continue to improve there is a possibility that direct personal relations might be established. (c). Local . In August the Sultan decided to appoint two Ministers to assist him in his work. He appointed Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, one of his uncles, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Sheikh Ahmad bin Ibrahim as Minister for Local Affairs. These officials are theoretically In complete control of their respect ive departments but in practice they are only permitted to make decisions on minor points and all matters of importance must be referred to the Sultan for final orders. A new Director of Customs was appointed in April. This official is a seconded officer from the Karachi Customs. He has been endeavouring, with some success, to reorganize the Customs department. There / have been4 have be ^ ^ff^chaDg^s^ln the govemorahips. The moat important^of Ismail bin Khalil Hassasi, a Palestinian, as Governor of Matrah in the place of Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal. The new governor has been 10 years in Muscat* H e was reported to De /ery anti-British but closer contact with the man has shown that this reputation was not deserved. Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal has not been given a further appointment. He is living in retirement on a tenth of his allowance the remaining nine tenths being used by the State to pay his considerable debts. The members of the ruling family have given little or no trouble and it is doubtful if any of the Sultan^ close relatives, since Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal^ brain became affected, have any influenoB, even in local affairs. They certainly have none in Oman. 4 * OIL CONCESSIONS . (a). Muscat Oil . The Geologists of Petroleum Concessions Limited conti nued their work until the second week in February when, after Pacing a short visit to Dhofar, having completed their winter programme ttoey left Muscat. Mr. B.H. Lermitte, a representative of Petroleum Concessions Limited,who had been negotiating with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi for entrance into the Ibri/Dhank/Hafit area arrived in Muscat in June. His negotiations with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had not proved as satisfactory as both he and his Company had hoped. Somewhat late in the day Petroleum Concessions Limited decided to approach the Sultan of Muscat for entry to the area which undoubtedly belonged to him and not to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Mr. Lermitte was well received and the Sultan was pre pared to allow the survey party to enter the Batinah, Dahirah, Baraimi and Mahadhah areas provided that motor cars were not used and that the party made their entrance into the area in / question6 question from the Baraimi or Muscat direction and not through the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The Sultan also stated that he would arrange for reliable people to accompany the party. He placed no restrictions on the time that the party remained in any particular place. However, Petroleum Concessions Limited were not favourably impressed and took the opportunity to make the Sultan’s objection to the use of motor cars a reason for not carrying out survey work this winter. A number of additional arguments: were also put forward but the majority of them, X fear, were not founded on facts. The impression given by the Company was that they were not sufficiently interested to undertake the expense of a long and tedious survey. (b). qwadur OH . Negotiations were continued with the Burmah Oil Company but in August they withdrew as Indian Oil Concessions Limited obtained the concession for Kalat State. As far as is known no definite agreement has been reached between the Sultan of Muscat and Indian Oil Concessions Limited 5. JUBICI/&amp;, Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report 6. TRADE . The following table shows the total imports and exports during the year 1938-39 as compared with the figures for the previous year i- Exports. Imports Year 1937-38 Rs. 32,99,015 Rs. 33,31,939 Rs. 41,16,125. Rs. 48,76,193. 1938-39 It will be seen that the imports and exports during the year 1938-39 have been increased by Rs. 7,09,068 and Rs. 32,924 respectively. The principal articles of import were rice and piece- / goods6 WH goods and those of export were dry and wet dates and dried fish, Japan remained the chief supplier of piece—goodsj matches and cement and India supplied practically the whole lot of 2 cereals. 7. A. ROYAL NAVY . Visits of His Majesty^ Ships and Royal Air Force aircraft to Muscat are given in Appendix A to this report. B. ROYAL AIR FORCE . The Royal Air Force maintained their wireless station at Muscat throughout the year. The staff consists of one non- Mo- commissioned officer and three operators from 203 (Flying Boat) Squadron at Basra. The station is in direct wireless communi cation with Shaibah and Habbaniyah in Iraq. 8. AVIATION GENERAL . Permission to land at Gwadur was accorded by His High ness the Sultan to machines of the Dutch K.L.M. and Air France Companies. No aircraft of the two companies alighted at that place during the year. The aerodrome at Gwadur is no longer maintained and supplies of fuel are not now available there. 9. FOREIGN INTERESTS. The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. 10. MISSIONARY &gt;VQRK . The Missionary work of the American South Arabian Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America) has been carried on by the Rev. and Mrs. Dykestra. They left for their usual hot weather visit to aouth India in June and returned in September. Dr. P.W.Harrisonj who first came to Muscat in 1913, remained in charge of the Medical side of the Mission at their hospital at Matrah from 1st January to 19th April / 1939, when he left Muscat for good. Dr. W.W.Thoms whose family / have forhave for long been associated with the Mission at Muscat arrived on the 6th of November and remained in charge of the Mission Hospital to the end of the year. The Mission have continued to make weekly visits to Birkah wnere they have* with the Sultan’s permission) construct ed quarters and Dr. Thoms has started a weekly surgery there on Thursdays. 11. SLAVE TRADE . During the year 53 slaves applied for manumission certificates and 37 slaves were manumitted. Of the 53 appli cants 36 were captured slaves (of whom 28 were manumitted) and the remainder were domestic slaves. Reports were received in May that slaves were being brought from Iranian Baluchistan and landed on the coast near Suwaiq. They were then said to be taken into the interior to Baraimi and sold to buyers from Saudi Arabia. The persons actively engaged in this work were Iranian Baluchis. The area chosen to land the slaves is inhabited by the Ya’al Sa’ad tribe. There is little doubt that some slaves were brought over and that they were taken inland. Hilal bin Hamad t the principal sheikh of that section of the Ya*al Sa f ad in the neighbourhood of Suwaiq | was undoubtedly involved with the Baluchi traders but to what extent is so far not clear. Representations were made to the Sultan and measures were taken to put an end to the trade. These measures have proved satisfactory and no further slave trading is taking place. During the last six months of the year no complaints were received nor were written or personal representations made to the Political Agent on his iroquet tours through the Suwaiq area. 12. WEATHER The total rainfall during the year was 4.SO inches. / The lackwmamt 8 Lhe lacic of rain is already being seriously felt and the local drinking water supply has become unpleasantly salt. The summer was mild without ,, garabie n (hot Westerly winds ) of the usual intensity and duration. The occurrence of a gc-rabi in October was unexpected and unwelcome as it did -tivc considerable damage to early vegetable crop$.ADMINISTRATION- REPORT of tie political AGZNCY . muscat FOR THE YEAR 1939. PART II. 1. RULING FAMILY &gt; (a) * His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur , With the exception of a short visit to Gwadur in April the Sultan has spent the whole year in or near Muscat town. A hot weather camp was laid out at Qantab, a small village six miles to the west of Muscat, and periodical visits were paid to it between June and August, when the Sultan again took up permanent residence in Muscat and the camp was dismantled. Cordial relations between the Agency and the Palace continued throughout the year. During the later half of the year the Sultan has taken more interest in the social life of the town. He has played tennis on a number of occasions at the Agency and has arranged for dinner parties to be given by the State Officials which have been attended by the Political Agent and members of his staff. (b) . Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal . Has played no part in State politics during the year* His unfortunate disease has now affected his brain and his speech has become indistinct. (c) . Saiyid Shahab b in Faisal-. He made a short tour of the Batinah in March and la+M paid a visit to Bombay returning to Muscat » at the end ox August. In August he was appointed Minister lor Foreign Affairs. The result of this appointment has been that certain subjects which were previously dealt with by the Sultan are now dealt with by the Minister. The appointment was made with a view to relieving the Sultan of a certain amount of routine / work10 work. \ir&lt;s In practice the Minister, who in theory is solely ponsible, is afraid to make any decision, on his own and invari ably refers to the Sultan. The result has been increased delay in the transaction of business and the Sultan has as much work as ever. (d). iaiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim . He was Wali of Birkah up to August 1938 when he was called into Muscat to advice the Sultan on certain tribal matters. He was appointed Minister for Internal Affairs in August (3J93^). He is a person of remarkable appearance and considerable person ality. (e) . Saiyid Mahmood bin Mohammad Turki . Returned to Muscat in August and appears to have made his pfcace with the Sultan. (f) . Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur . He has been receiving Arabic lessons and instruction in local customs and the correct behaviour on ceremonial occasions. He has been treated as the heir apparent although no pronouncement has been made on this subject. The Sultan has personally supervised his education. In August the young man was sent to Sur to receive further instruction# from the able Saud bin Ali and had not returned by the end of the year. (g) * Saivid Ma.iid bin Taimur . His half brother, the Sultan, abolished the Civil Courts in August and thereby deprived him of his acting appointment as Judge of the Muscat Court. Since September he has been acting as Passport Officer. (hJ. ^Mr. T.F.T. Al Saeed” . He has played no part in local affairs this year. He left Japan for Singapore in September with the intention of paying a visit to Muscat and eventually making his home in South In^.ia. Japan seemediio have lost its interest for him. In November his ^ / Japanese wifeJapanese wife died and he/returned to Japan to settle his affairs. He is expected to send his daughter by his Japanese wife to Muscat and he may himself carry out his declared intention of residing in India. (i). Suleiman al Baruni al Nafusi . This stormy petrel has remained quietly in Muscat. He has lost the confidence of the Sultan and is seldom consulted on Internal Affairs although he is nominally the Sultan’s Adviser on this subject and receives an honorarium as such. The out break of the war brought new hope to the old man. He expected Italy to side with Germany and he saw visions of Tripoli regain ing her independence. He offered his assistance to France and wrote of the influence he could still exert in Tripoli. The course of the war has disappointed him and he seems to have slipped back into the state of inertia from which he was momentarily awakened. 2. TRADE &amp; COMMERCE. This subject has already been dealt with in Part I of this report. 3. MUNICIPALITY., The Municipality has functioned during the year with some success. Although no major works have been undertaken some effort has been made to clean up the town and repair some of the roads. A timely fire at Muscat destroyed the vegetable market and coffee shops outside the 'Bab al Saghir'. The Municipality have approved and are carrying out a scneme to provide cement concrete shops some distance from The gate. «»ork has already commenced and some dozen shops have been completed. The old temporary shelters that sprang up aftei the tire wi-l V be abolished and it is hoped to maintain a reasonably nigh leve The Municipal President! Saiyid of sanitation in the area.Hilal bin Badr, is a pleasant and well meaning man but lacier sufficient drive to really make much impression on the condition of the town. The leading merchants are completely lacking in puolie spirit and the Municipal Committee seem to have neither the desire nor the courage to introduce necessary sanitary and public health reforms. The merchants and the public seem to prefer the present insanitary and disgraceful conditions to giving material and moral support to the Municipality in their endeavours to improve the living co .ditions of the people. 4 * £5^ f IIRAL COMMUNICATIQfra . Mr. G. Gilby remained in charge of the local office of ^ tireless Limited from 1st January to 8th February lcM9 t Mr. F.Lobo from 9th February to 6th September 1939, and Ur. J. A.Faithful from 7th September to the end of the year. rrom lat January to 18th April 1939 and from 1st August to 31st December 1939 telegraphic communication with the outside world was interrupted owing to the breakdown of the Company* s caoles. Cable dc Wireless Limited arranged with the Royal Air -orce Authorities to send and receive all classes of traffic through the Air Force wireless station at Muscat. This arrange ment continued until the 17th December 1939 when the installation of the Company^ new wireless transmitting and receiving set was completed. 5. MUSCAT INFANTRY . Subadar Hazur Hussain acted as Commandant of the Muscat Levy with effect from 1st January to 8th March 1939, when Subadar Jahan Dad of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Punjab Regiment arrived from India and took over charge. For the first few months after his appointment Subadar Jahan Dad was keen and did excellent work. Lately however there has been a falling off in his work. Very few Indian Officers are capable of maintaining a high standard of work and efficiency / unlessunless supervised by a British Officer; unfortunately Subadar Jah an Dad does not happen to be one of the few. However, in spite of a tendency on the part of their Commandant to take the line of least resistance, the Levy are more efficient than when he took over. 6. STATS FINANCES . Rai Sahib Duli Chand, the Director of Customs and Comptroller, left Muscat in March without the Sultan^ pemission and was dismissed from State service on the same day. Since his departure the Sultan has himself taken control of State finances. He admits no one to the financial secrets of Muscat. The Agency is provided with figures quarterly which are said to show the financial position but as it is not possible to check them it is very difficult to estimate accurately the degree of solvency or insolvency the State finances have reached. From figures pro- ^ ^ voided by the Sultan and from careful enquiries it seems that this year the State has just managed to pay its way with a very small margin on the credit side. Copies of the State 'Receipts'^ and ’’Expenditure' 1 statements for the last quarter of the year form an Appendix to this report. The increase in Customs receipts was due to abnormal imports of commodities due to the formation ol a food reserve in Muscat and Matrah. The abnormal expenditure under ’’P.W.D. and Municipalities” was due to an endeavour to complete the new school building during the year. On the 31st December the State’s financial position was said by the Sultan to be as follows s- Cash on hand in the Muscat Treasury - Rs. 1,27,932/14. Invested in Government of India Loan - as. 99,906/ 4. Invested in Newfoundland Stock - Rs. 36,209/ 5. Cash i in the Imperial Bank of India - Rs. 32,000/ -. ! Advances recoverable - as. 4,822/ 8. Total Rs. 3,00,869/15* No Sidministration can consider this sum as an adequate reserve. / It wouldIt would not be considered as an adequate working balance in most Colonial Administrations* Only Rs. 1,59,932/14/- of this amount is 11 ready* money, which it is possible to utilise as a working balance. The result has been that during the year under review there has been more than one occasion when the monthly receipts have not been sufficient to meet the monthly salary bill and recourse has had to be made to local business men for temporary loans On one occasion Rs. 25,000 were obtained from the State account in a Bombay Bank to meet current expenditure. The StaU has not been able to pay anything towards the redemption of a del of Rs. 71,263 which has been owing to Messrs. Khan Bahadur Nasib and Son for some years, and it is more than probable that fresh loans have been obtained from State subjects. The financial position is better than it was last year. The position is however unsatisfactory. The State has now reserve worthy of th name and no working balance. There is no margin for much neede . educational and public health measures. A serious shortage of^ rain affecting the date crop or other unforeseeable disaster ^ the State will be in serious difficulties. Xt is difficult to see how further economies can be introduced. Expenditure hasa reduced to a minimum. The Customs Tariff has been raised and^ duties have been increased. The new duties will come into for • gradually in 1940 and may result in a satisfactory balance on ; ti credit side at the end of the year. A further diminuation in. Gwadur revenue is anticipated and there will probably be a fall imports at Muscat due to world conditions and the abnormal imports in the last quarter of this year ao that the yield ^ the increased duties may only be sufficient to maintain the mated figure in the 1940 budget. The Director of Customs witl this possibility before him has been carefux not tv bidg ^ j rr iqao. His estimate is the increase in Customs revenue during 1940 C h&gt; „ K 39 ..«»«. “I the stew must Just err, « «d hop. th.t. ~ M ° r th / Sultan 1 s15 Sultan* s enemies will precipitate a financial crisis. 7- WAK MEASURES . The Sultan has identified himself with the Allied cause and has repeatedly expressed his friendship for Great Britain and his earnest wish that His Majesty r s forces may speedily prove successful. lie has provided all facilities asked for without question. An agreement has been entered into with the Sultan by which he has undertaken to grant such facilities as Hie Majesty’s Government may require for the Royal Navy and for the Royal Air Force. In return he received a present of arms and ammunition and a grant of Rs. 50,000. He has also been alloted a financial subsidy which is designed to enable him to undertake certain defence measures, which the outbreak of hostilities in kurope has indirectly rendered desirable and which the grant of the afore said facilities may in the future make essential. The Sultan has issued notifications forbidding any trading with the enemy and making it an offence to do any act which may in any way be adverse to the interests of His Majesty's Government in their prosecution of the war* Local measures have been taken to prevent profiteering and to maintain a three months reserve of essential food-stuffs. The export of silver has been forbidden with the object of conserv ing the already inadequate supplies of Maria Theresa dollars. The Sultan has under consideration the installation of wireless telephony at Sur, Sohar, Dhofar and Muscat to enable him to keep in close touch with the principal governors. The strength of the Levy is to be more than doubled and recruiting has already been started. A survey of the Batinah fortifications has been carried out and the long over due repairs to strong points are to be under taken as soon as possible.1 1 APPENDIX B.

In February a few cases of smallpox occurred in Matrah and there was every indication that an epidemic was starting but prompt action by the Medical Authorities proved effective and the infection was localised. Contacts being taken to the Quarantine Station. The problems of sanitation and malaria are now being dealt with by the Muscat Government. It has been decided to introduce a simple sanitary system in 1941 and funds are being provided for this purpose and for anti-malarial measures.by the Municipality. The Agency has agreed, at the Sultan’s request, to advise on the introduction and working of these measures which are the outcome of a scheme prepared by the Agency for the / Sultan2 Sultan eighteen months ago. (b). Agency Hospital^ Treatment at the 'Out PatienV Department has continued to be free and funds provided by public subscription have proved ample to meet the cost of drugs and appliances. The re-laying of the hospital floors was completed during the year and new instruments to the value of £. 86 were purchased from England. Attendances and admittances during the year were as follows i- 'Out Patlent'Department Admitted into the hospital Major and minor operations performed Maternity cases Gynaecological cases (c). Quarantine . 25,771 persons. 139 persons. 665. 3. Quarantine restrictions were imposed against Karachi for smallpox on two occasions. The quarantine buildings are on the whole in good condition. The examination of dhows using the port is still by no means perfect but the new police regulations have included certain elementary rules making it incumbent on nakhudas to declare cases of sickness among the passengers and crew. 3. POLITICAL SITUATION . (a). General . Two minor disturbances occurred during the year. One at Gwadur in November when the Governor’s matrimonial intentions resulted in unrest among the Baluchis of the Nigor, and the other at Dhibah where a quarrel broke out between the Jawasim subjects of the Sheikh of Kalba and the Shihuh subjects of the Sultan over a servant of the former. The Sultan took prompt action in each case sending a commission to Gwadur to enquire into the grievances of the Baluchis and despatching the Governor of Sohar, Mudhaffar bin Suleiman, with plenipotentiary powers to Dhibah. / The Gwadur3 The Gwadur commission reported against the Governor who has been censured and whose recall has been decided upon. The Governor of Sohar was successful in restoring the situation to normal at Dhibah where he seems to have co-operated well with Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, and the Sheikh of Fujairah who acted as an intermediary during the negotiations. In March the murder by men of the Beni Hass an of a Saudi subject who was a Qadi of the Beni Bu Ali resulted in unrest between those two tribes which continued with varying intensity throughout the year, but at the close of the year peace appeared * to have been restored. There was no other tribal strife worthy of notice and the year has on the whole been a peacelul one. (b). Oman . The Sultan's influence has undoubtedly increased in Oman as a result of his policy of peaceful penetration which takes the form of encouraging visits from important Sheikhs and strict observance of the tenets of the Abadhi faith. The process must necessarily be a long one and it will not be possible to estimate the extent to which the Sultan's influence has increased until the present Imam either dies or is forced to abdicate. The Sultan's relations with the two principal supporters of the Imam, Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi of the Sharqiah and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdar, have remained good. The Imam receives the support of these two Sheikhs from very different motives. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh is a bigoted Abadhi and his antipathy to the Sultan and his regime is a religious one and therefore all the more difficult to overcome. It is unlikely that this Sheikh will ever be on really friendly terms with His Highness or his successors. Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar's alliance with the Imam is from personal motives. In order to ensure his continued support the Imam has permitted him to acquire more influence and power than would ever have been his had he remained loyal to the Al Bu Said family. Suleiman bin Hamiyar well knows that the Sultan would be willing to grant him the privileges of an important Sheikh and any serious threat to the power of the Imam4 would probably result in his deserting his patron and making his peace with Muscat, The most important political event of the year was the visit of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi to Muscat. He arrived with several members of his family on the 27th of February and remained in Muscat until the 3rd of April when he went to Bahrain for medical treatment. He returned to Muscat in the middle of May and remained until the 13th of June when he left for Oman. A fortnight after Sheikh Isa bin Saleh arrived from Oman, that is about the 15th of March, he became seriously ill with pneumonia and was attended by the Agency Assistant Surgeon and Dr. «.W. Thoms of the American South Arabian Mission. Due entirely to the efforts of these two doctors Sheikh Isa bin Saleh recovered and with his usual lack of breeding and good manners refrained from in any way expressing either his thanks or his gratitude to them for saving his life. Sheikh Suleiman bin Sinan of Yankul spent three months in Muscat towards the end of the year and a number of other important tribal Sheikhs paid visits, some of these for the first time. Most of the important Sheikhs who visited the Sultan during the course of the year have also called at the Agency. Even Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi found it convenient to call. The Persians invaded Muscat in 1737 and remained in possession until they were forced to withdraw in 1744 by Ahmad bin Said the founder of the Al Bu Said dynasty, rear of a iersian invasion is always present in the hearts of the Omanis, normally dormant it is awakened to their realisation by any major world crises news of which penetrates into their country. In November the Sultan received a letter from Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi which amounted to an offer of services in the event of any aggressive action by Iran and of course a request for arms and ammunition which was very properly ignored. At the same time the Imam indicated in a letter from one of his principal satellites that he proposed to send a representative to discuss the situation with the Sultan after the Ramazan, and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar / indicated inindicated in a letter that he himself would like an invitation to Muscat for the same purpose* (c). Local * The two Ministers who were appointed last year conti nued to hold office but their actual power has not increased and all matters of the slightest importance are referred to the Sultan* The Director of Customs has been busy during the year examining the economic situation and considering methods for increasing the State income* He has also compiled comprehensive Customs Regulations in which task he received considerable aid from the Agency. The Regulations although complete will not be introduced until January 1941. There have been one or two changes in the officials, the most import aunt of which was the appointment in December of Saiyid Mahmood bin Mohammad bin Turki, a first cousin once removed of the Sultan, to the Governorship of Birkah* Two members of the Ruling Family gave trouble during the year. One was Saiyid Mohammad bin Mohammad bin Turki who became intoxicated and created a disturbance in Muscat town in January, and the other was Saud bin Ali bin Salim, a maternal uncle, who insulted Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal in February. / They both spent the remainder of the year in Jalali Fort. 4. OIL CONCESSIONS * V (a). Muscat Oil . Owing to world conditions no work has been done and further exploration has been postponed for the time being. (*&gt;)• Gwadur Oil . There has been no change in the situation since last year. 6. JUDICIAL . Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. 6. TRADE . The following table shows the total imports and exports during the year 1939-40 as compared with the figures for the / previous6 previous year Xfear- Imports. 1938-39. Rs. 48,76,193 1939-40. Rs. 46,49,765 Exports. Be. 33,31,939. Rs. 34,55,796. It will be seen that while during the year 1939-40 imports have decreased by Rs. 2,26,428 exports have increased by Rs. 1,23,856. The principal articles of import were rice and piece- goods and those of export were dry and wet dates and dried fish. Japan remained the chief supplier of piece-goods,'matches and cement, and India supplied practically the whole of the cereals. 7. ROYAL NAVY &amp; ROYAL AIR FORCE . (a) . Royal Navy . No ships of the Royal Navy visited Muscat during the year. (b) . Royal Air Force . The Royal Air Force maintained their wireless station at Muscat throughout the year. The staff at present consists of three European operators. The station is in direct wireless communication with Shaibah and Habbaniyah in Iraq. Visits of Royal Air Force aircraft to Muscat are given in Appendix rt A M to this report. 8. AVIATION . No machines of the K.L.M. Company or the Air France Company landed at Gwadur during the year and there is no indi cation that the former company intends to ask for the renewal for 1941 of the special authorisation granted for 1940. 9. FRENCH INTERESTS . The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. 10. MISSIONARY *&gt;QRK. The Missionary work of the American South Arabian Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of / AmericaAmerica) has been carried on by the Rev. &amp; Mrs. Dykestra. They left for their usual hot weather visit to South India in September and returned in November. Dr. W. W. Thoms remained in charge of the medical side of the Mission at their hospital at Matrah. The Mission have continued to pay visits to Birkah where Dr. Thoms attends 'Out Patients' at the Mission hutment. In November Dr. Thoms visited Jebel Akhdar at the invitation of Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar to attend a relative of the Sheikh who had been gored by a bull. The Rev. D.Dykestra accompanied him and the visit appears to have been generally successful. The Sultan was annoyed that the visit was paid without his permission and has restricted the touring of the members of the Mission to the Batinah coast region. An X-Ray apparatus has been installed in the Mission hospital at Matrah. n. sbm m s * - During the year thirty-two slaves applied for manumissioi certificates and twenty-three slaves were manumitted. Of the thirty-two applicants eighteen were captured slaves (of whom twelve were manumitted) and the remainder were domestic slaves. No case of slave trading has been reported and the Batinah area has been particularly quiet. This is due to the interest taken in the suppression of the trade by the Sultan ana frequent touring by the Political Agent. Any diminution in these activities to suppress the trade would result in an immediate recrudescence. 12. FATHER . The total rainfall during the year was 2.91 inches. The lack of rain was felt throughout the year and the local drinking water supply was unpleasantly salt. Many wells have dried up and the authorities are concerned at the prospect of a serious shortage. As an experimental measure a dam has been constructed in the Wadi al fcabir with the object of testing the porosity of the / Wadi bede 'iWI - ? rfadi bed to see if water would remain for a sufficient time to^^ warrant the construction of a dam sufficiently high to retain enough water for the population for four to five months thus conserving the supply from the wells. The dam was filled during a rain storm in December but more time must elapse before the result of the experiment is known.9 ADMINISTRATION REPOR T OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY. MUSCAT FOR THE YEAR 1940. PART II. i. BflJBa FAMiiy . (a) . HIg Highnaee Saiyjd Said bin Talaur . Relations between the Agency and the Palace have remain ed extremely cordial and on several occasions the Sultan has entered into the social life of the town besides playing tennis regularly at the Agency. The Sultan paid a short visit to Dhofar from the 25th of February to the 24th of March. In April he went to India where he remained for three months returning to Muscat in July. He spent most of his time in India in Bombay paying a short visit to Poona and another to Calcutta. In August he made a tour of the Batinah towns going as far north as Shinas to which place he had previously never travelled by car. This tour was a success and stimulated the energies of the Governors to make more of sun effort than they had previously done to repair and renew their fortifications. In December the Sultan was delighted to hear that his wife, who is living in Dhofar, had given birth to a male child. There was great satisfaction in Muscat and the child has been accepted generally as the heir. He has been named haboos and is to remain in Dhofar for the present with his mother who is a lady of good family from a Dhofari tribe. The Sultan was particularly gratified to receive the congratulations of His Majesty the King on the event. (b) . Saivid Shah ab bin Faisal. He has retained his appointment as Minister for External Affairs and was left in charge during the absence of the Sultan in Dhofar and Bombay. Should the Sultanate become vacant there is little doubt that he would act as Regent for the Multan 1 s minor son while should any misfortune befalls the child ^aiyid Shahab would succeed as Sultan. He is an intelligent man ana very well disposed towards Great Britain but unfortunately his / somewhatsomewhat harsh disposition has made him unpopular, (c). Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim . He has retained his appointment throughout the year. He has not brought himself before the public eye at all and has been content to carry on his duties to the best of his ability and lay out a garden at Hiyam, a village between Muscat and Matrah. (d). Saivid Mahmood ^in Mohammad bin Turkl . Saiyid Mahmood remained unemployed for the greater part of the year. He and his brother Ali bin Mohammad bin Turki were thought in May and June to be voicing opinions not in accord with the Sultan’s attitude of extreme friendliness to the British Government. The matter came to the Sultan’s ears and Saiyid Mahraood and his brother were threatened with imprisonment in Jalali Fort. In the autumn the Sultan consulted the Agency regarding certain changes in the Governors which he considered desirable. It was suggested to him that Saiyid Mahmood would be better employed in directing his active brain to the solution of the problems of a Wilayat than idling away his time in Muscat. In Decamber the Sultan appointed him Governor of Birkah. His attitude now is distinctly pro-British. Ce). Saiyid Tari k bin Taimur. He accompanied the Sultan to India and on his return to Muscat was instructed to make himself acquainted with the machinery of Government. The Sultan was concerned about his lack of application and laziness. He sought the advice of the Agency pointing but that no one other than himself was prepared to reprimand Saiyid Tarik who might one day quite conceivably become Sultan and therefore the young man was doing just what he liked when not actually under his eye. The Sultan was auvised to send Saiyid Tarik to Bait-al-Falaj for a six months course of training under the Military Adviser, Major A.O.C. Pettyfer, who would report to the Sultan on the young nan’s character and general ability. Saiyid Tarik joined the Muscat Infantry as a / private11 ^5b private soldier in October being treated in every way as a recruit except that he occupied an Indian Officer’s quarter and had his own private servant* He has made good progress and is now being instructed in the principles of leadership with a view to his acting as a platoon and afterwards company commander. He has benefitted both physically and mentally by the active and busy life of Bait-al-Falaj. (f). “ Mr, He left Japan in September ana made his way via Singapore and Calcutta to Karachi arriving there in November. He was accompanied by his half Japanese daughter and Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily the Sultan’s Secretary who was sent to Singapore to meet him. He will probably reside permanently in Karachi where he has taken a house and where he will be joined by his wife, the Sultan’s mother, early in 1941. (g). Ismail bi n Khalil Rassasl. A Palestinian subject who came to Muscat as a school master fourteen years ago. A man of considerable ability he has worked his way up to the important governorship of Matrah. He has recently been employed by the Sultan to carry out inspect ion tours of the Batinah and Wilayats. He has considerable influence with the Sultan and was at one time thought to hold anti-British views. Closer contact with him has shown that while naturally favouring the cause of the Arabs in Palestine his views are by no means anti-British and he has throughout the year willingly co-operated with the Agency in the many, matters affecting the interests of the British subjects in Matrah. Since the outbreak of the war he has been helpful in spreading pro-British propaganda. (h). Suleiman fiaruni al Nafusi. He accompanied the Sultan to Bombay in April ana died there of heart failure on the 30th of April. For years he had hoped and prayed that the call would come for him to return to North Africa to work for the liberation of his country, Tripoli. By a queer twist of fortune the call came six weeks after his / death12 death in the form of an urgent request for his services from tSe French General Officer Commanding North Africa with instructions for him to be sent to Algiers by the quickest means, 2. TBADK &amp; COMMERCE . This subject has already been dealt with in Part I of this report. 3 . The Municipality have continued their efforts to clean up the town with considerable success and Muscat has a much less dilapidated appearance than it had. Unfortunately no new work has been taken in hand and no improvements to the roads or open spaces have been made. The inertia of the President and his Committee has caused the Sultan to seek the Agency's help. Naturally help has not been refused and the President has received advice on the Municipal Budget for 1941. 4. EDUCATION . The new school building at Muscat was completed in December and was formally opened by the Sultan who took the opportunity to address the notables present on the importance of education. The building is a pleasant looking edifice of re inforced concrete. The class rooms are large and airy and the walls are sufficiently thick to prevent the labours of one class disturbing the studies of the one next door. The headmaster is a Palestinian who has recently arrived and who will probably be followed by other masters as the attendance at the school increases. It is hoped to add a boarding establishment next year to cater for the sons of people living in the Interior and up the Batinah coast. 5. GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS . Mr. J.A. Faithful remained in charge of the local office of ! i Cable &amp; Wireless Limited throughout the year. The Bushire cable was repaired in the middle of January and the Karachi cable during the first week of February. The / cables13 cables remained serviceable the greater part of the year but Bushire cable again broke in December and had not been repaired by the end of the year. 6. POLICE . The training of the police in routine procedure was successfully carried out by Mr. Azizullah Khan, a retired Prose cuting Inspector from the United Provinces. Unfortunately this officer was lacking in personality and no disciplinarian and became more of a figure of fun than of fear to the lower elements in the population. The Sultan decided, on the advice of the Military Adviser, that an officer of quite a different type was essential and Mr. Azizullal^s services were terminated on the expiration of his probationary period. The police force has been placed under the Military Adviser for discipline and training and under the Minister for External Affairs for policy and police duties. By the end of the year Mr. Azizullah had not been replaced although every effort was being made to obtain a suitable individual. At the request of the Sultan the Agency prepared for the Muscat Government ’’Harbour and Police” rules which were approved by the Sultan and came into force early in April. 7. MUSCAT INFANTRY . An important part of the defence measures rendered necessary by the war and for which the Gultan is in receipt of financial assistance has been the increase in the strength of the Muscat Infantry from ISO all ranks to 355 all ranks. The Sultan asked for the assistance of a British Officer to undertake the raising of the additional men and the organising and training of the Muscat Infantry. Major A.O.C. Pettyfer of the 10th 3aluch Regiment was selected to undertake this work ana he ari ived ao Muscat on the 5th of March. The work has been ably carried out and the Muscat Infantry may now be considered as a well equipped and organised force trained in the use of their arms. The force has been organised into a Headquarter Company comprising signalling. / artillery14 [JSI 1^/TolT artillery, machine gun and administration platoons and two Rifle Companies of three platoons each. In addition to rifles the force is armed with two 2.75 mountain guns, three 3-pounder Q.F. guns, seven machine guns and four light automatics. The force is officered by three Viceroy Commissioned Indian Officers on deputation from the Indian Army and one locally recruited Baluch ✓ Jamadar. The living accommodation at Bait-al-Falaj has been much improved and there is a well equipped hospital in charge of a qualified medical officer. A training camp was held at Bosher in November and the Company Commanders were able to put into practice the theories they had learnt in barracks while the Military Adviser, who was himself in camp, was able to test the efficiency and practicability of the organisation which he had devised for the force. All charges including pay and allowances leave and pension contributions of the Military Adviser and the three Viceroy Commissioned Indian Officers on deputation as well as those of instructors on deputation from the Indian Army are met by the State. 8. STATE FINANCES . The Sultan retained personal control of the State finances during the year. From figures produced by the Sultan and from careful enquiries it is clear that in spite of consider able increase in the expenditure which had not been budgetteci for the State has not only succeeded in paying its way but has been able to transfer a sum of Bs. 64,895-2-0 to the Reserve. This is largely due to the fact that the Director of Customs under estimated his receipts by Rs. 1,08,187-1-0. He had anticipated a falling off in imports into Muscat owing to the disturbed state of world trade and expected the abnormally large imports in the last quarter of 1939 to affect adversally imports in 1940. He budgetted for the anticipated decrease in revenue from these causes to be offset by the increase in the rate of import duty on certain commodities. During the year under review trade conditions in the Gulf of Oman remained much the same as in 1939 comb me a and a rise in the value of imports/with the absorption of the16 \ stocks of cereals on hand at the close of that year by unexpect ed demands from Omani buyers resulted in the considerable surplus. A part of this surplus has been absorbed by the increased expenditure on State buildings and the completion of the modern and well designed school building. The Wilayat of Sohar which was expected to produce Rs. 30,000 from Zakat was Rs. 19,126 in arears at the close of the year. Rs. 11,000 of this deficit is is represented by dates received as Zakat which had not been marketed at the close of the year. During the coming year the Director of Customs anti cipates that there will be no material falling off in Customs receipts as he considers that the rise in the prices of imports will compensate for a possible reduction in the quantities imported and that the quantity of cereals now available in the Interior will be maintained at its present level as a reserve for the duration of the war. tfhen peace does come there will probably be a serious reduction, I trust of a temporary nature, in the Customs revenue of the State and the Sultan is being encouraged to prepare for such an eventuality. On the 31st December, 1940, the State’s financial position was said by the Sultan to be as follows *- Cash on hand in the Muscat Treasury - Rs. 2,22,423- 8- 0. Invested in Government of India loan - Rs. 99,906- 4- 0. - Rs. 36,209- 6- 0 - Rs. 7,227- 0- 0 Invested in stocks Advances recoverable in 1941 Rs. 3,66,766- 1- 0 Rs. 3,00,869-16- 0 Total Cash on hand on 1-1-40 Rs. 64,895- 2- 0 Savings during the year 9. WAR (a), war Measures The Sultan has continued to identify himself with the Allied cause and his expressions of friendship have the merit of / beingbeing sincere. He has followed with interest the varying fortune of the British forces and has never, even in the dark days of May and June, lost faith in the ultimate success of the British Empire. Notifications forbidding trading with the enemy have been issued by the State and the Sultan has issued precise instructions to his Governors to prevent Muscat dhows from carry ing goods to the Italian Colonies. The prohibition of the export of silver except in the form of rupee coin has been continued throughout the year. The local reserve of foodstuffs was reduced in December from three months 1 supply to one and a half months* supply. It became possible to do this when the shipping position in the Persian Gulf made it unlikely that there would be any prolonged delay in the arrival of steamers from India. The work on the Batinah fortifications has been very slow due partly to the annual exodus of labourers in the late summer to work at the date harvest and partly to a lack of competent masons. The work is now in hand and some of the pro jects are nearing completion. Ilerani Fort at Muscat has been largely restored and a 3-pounder gun has been placed on a perma nent mounting on one of the towers commanding the approaches to the town from the Interior and to the harbour from the sea. Unfortunately owing to circumstances outside the State's control the wireless equipment ordered early in 1940 has not yet been delivered although it is reported to have been shipped. In November it was noticed that abnormally large quantities of kerosene were being exported principally to Aden and Mukalla and in order to conserve local supplies and prevent as far as possible any consignments finding their way to the Italian East Africa it was found necessary to prohibit the export of petrol and kerosene except under special permit from the Director of Customs. —~ (b). war Contributions . Muscat has not been backward in offering financial , / assistanceassistance to His Majesty's Government and the various charities specially designed to meet harship caused by the war. In January £. 10-10-0 were subscribed to the Red Cross Fund. In March Re. 2,419 were remitted to the Viceroy's War Purposes Fund for comforts for Indian soldiers in France. In July a local &amp;ar Purposes Fund was formed and by the middle of November £. 1,200 had been remitted to the India Office. In November the Resident's Persian Gulf Fighter Fund was started and to date Rs.4,595-lfr-3 have been contributed. All the Indian merchants and other merchants of British nationality voluntarily contribute monthly sums to the Fighter Fund based on the value of their imports and exports. (c). Publicity . ^ While there has never been any anti-British propaganda in Muscat other than enemy wireless broadcasts it was considered desirable to so prepare the ground that any attempt to introduce subversive propaganda would prove unprofitable and to this end a weekly news letter or paper in Arabic has been issued from the Agency. This paper which goes by the name of 'Al Haq' reports the latest accurate British wireless news, contains articles received from the Embassy in Baghdad and the Publicity Officer in Bahrain, and from time to time publishes articles written by local contributors. In addition items of local interest are included with the object of making the paper interesting to all sections of the literate public. The paper is normally of six foolscap pages and has a limited circulation oi one hundr q^. and fifty copies. The circulation could be much increased bpt there are various production difficulties which have first to be over come. It is issued free of charge and penetrates into the interior of Oman where it is the only medium through which news of the war reaches the people. Important copies of the paper are translated into Gujrati for the benefit of the Hindu merchants. Illustrated papers have been received regularly / from the18 from the Publicity Officer at Bahrain and also from the Embassy in Baghdad and have been much appreciated their appeal being particularly strong to those members of the population who are unable to read.

A Public Health Department has now been started as a branch of the Municipality, which has made a very good start on its anti-malaria campaign under Saiyid Abbas bin Faisal. This has consisted of oiling wells and searching houses for larvae. This search is particularly carried out in houses in the vicinity of the houses of patients reporting with malaria to the Agency Hospital. It is hoped later to extend this department’s activities by public instruction on the anti-malaria topic, ana2 when funds permit, spraying of houses with Pyrocide solution. Sanitary works are reported in Part II under Municipality. (h). Agency Hospital . The hospital was open throughout the year and was well attended by the public. The following patients were treated *- rt Out Patients Department - 23,192 persons. Admitted into the hospital - 95 persons. Major and minor operations performed - 380. The chief diseases were malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal infections and eye infections. (c). Quarantine . At the end of the year smallpox became somewhat serious at Birkah, on the Batinah, and at Nakhl, in Oman. There were several cases in Matrah and some deaths. A land quarantine station has been opened at Ruwi, to the east of Matrah, where local cases and contacts are segregated, instead of at Haramil, the sea quarantine station. A vaccinator has been daily on duty at Ghureifa, to vaccinate persons arriving from infected zones by land; and persons arriving by sea from Birkah have been vaccinated by the Agency Hospital on their arrival. 3. POLITICAL SITUATION . (a). Tribal . (i). A squabble has been in progress at Dibah during the whole of the year between the two clans which inhabit the two parts of the town, the Jawasim (which have now come under the control of Kalba) ana the Shihuh (who are subject to Muscat). The business has been characterized by all the usual 1 ormalities attendant on such incidents, truces and breaches of truces, negotiations and protraction of negotiations, and a note-worthy absence of casualties. At the close of the year, a settlement was made by Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, the Minister lor Internal4 Salim bin Humaid appointed Wali of Quriyat in January. Hamad bin Hilal as Somar (ex-Wali of Quriyat) appointed Wali of Gwadur in January. Hsonood bin Ahmad (ex-Wali of Gwadur) appointed Wali of Sib in April. Sultan bin Hamood appointed Wali of Quriyat in October. Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain Khan, formerly Treasury Officer of the Agency, was appointed Finance Officer on the 6th October. 4. JUDICIAL . Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. 5. TRADE . (i). The following table shows the total imports and exports during the year 1940-41 as compared with the figures for previous Exports . Rs. 33,31,939. Rs. 34,55,795. Rs. 30,22,170. The approximate maintenance of the value of imports should not give a false impression of prosperity, as it merely means that a fall in the quantity of imports has corresponded to the rise in the price of commodities. In the case of rice, the most essential food stuff, imports fall hy 45 thousand hags. The average rise in the level of the price of essential food-stuffs is nearing the 50% mark, the effect of which on the poorer classes may he imagined. The;, have naturally had to restrict consumption, and imports have therefore dropped. (ii). The rise in steamer freights has played its part in forcing prices up. To Bombay, the rise is nearly 50% and to Colombo 20%. Dhows are consequently at a premium, and a good dhow may nearly puy for itself in a single voyage. years s- Year. Imports 1338-39. Bs. 48,76,193 1939-40. Rs. 46,49,765 1940-41. Rs. 46,28,9776 (iii) * On the export side* the market for sardines and fish meal has almost entirely disappeared as a result of the British naval blockade; and since the outbreak of war in the Far East, the market for shark-fins has also gone. The export of dates maintained its level during the past year, though Iraq is now appearing as a competitor in the dry date market. Exports of limes dropped as a result of a bad crop. (iv) . For most of the year the Maria Theresa thaler remained more or less at parity with the rupee; but towards the end of the year there was a sharp rise in the price of silver caused by the outbreak of war with Japan. (v) . India is now beginning to get a good hold on the local market for cheap fabrics and matches, which was formerly held by Japan. (vi) . A price control committee has been functioning throughout the year. Jhile it has not entirely succeeded in its aim, it has probably prevented the worse forms of profiteering. Towards the end of the year, the method of calculating the basic price was reviewed and revised. (vii) . At the close of the year, the question of the formation of a Majlis at-Tijara was under consideration and preliminary discussions with the State authorities. 6. ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL AIR FORCE . (a) . Roval Navy . A cruiser flying the flag of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, steamed across the entrance to the Muscat harbour on the 26th April. (b) . Royal Air Force . The Royal Air Force maintained their wireless station at Muscat throughout the year. The staff at present consists of three European operators. The station is in direct wireless communication with Shaibah and Habbaniyah in »Iraq. Visits of Royal Air Force aircraft to Muscat are given in Appendix ,, A H to this report.B Cm) 7. PIRACY . During the early and middle parts of the year, an Iranian Baluchi named Mirza bin Birkat was carrying on slaving and piracy from a base in Fujairah, where he enjoyed the protection of the Sheikh. He was subsequently evicted on pressure being brought to bear on the Sheikh through the Wali of Sohar; and the Political Agent, Bahrain, who later visited Fujairah, found that he had shifted his headquarters, and cautioned the Sheikh against receiving him again. At the close of the year, he was reported to be based near Jask (he is a Jaski). 8. FRENCH INTERESTS . The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. 9. MISSIONARY WORK . The evangelical work of the American South Arabian Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America) has been carried on by the Rev. and Mrs. Dykstra. They left for their usual hot weather visit to South India in August and returned in October. Dr. W.W. Thongs remained in charge of the medical side of the Mission at their hospital at Matrah; and he has a new assistant, Dr. Job. 10. SLAVERY . During the year thirty-eight slaves applied for manumission certificates and twenty-seven slaves were manumitted. Of the thirty-eight applicants twenty-two were captured slaves (of whom fifteen were manumitted) and the remainder were domestic slaves. 11. WEATHER . The total rainfall during the year was 0.53 inches. The lack of rain was felt throughout the year and the local drinkir water supply has become unpleasantly salt. The summer this year was one of the most intolerable ever experienced.7 ms. u- 1. RULING FAMILY . (a). His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur . The Sultan spent about four months in India in the early part of the year, where he met his father, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal. He left for Dhofar in the autumn, where he gives indication of intending to make a prolonged stay. This matter is, however, less of a disadvantage then previously, as Dhofar has now been linked with Muscat by W/T and aircraft are visiting it comparatively frequently. His Highness^ attitude has remained correct and cordial throughout the year. (b). Saivid Shahab bin Faisal . He has continued as Minister for External Affairs, and at the close of the year was officiating, as usual, as His Highness * s Representative during the latter’s absence in Dhofar. His favourite ’’delaying action' tactics of ending a discussion or a correspondence by saying that it must be referred to the Sultan, has lost much of its (to him) value by the increased ease with which such reference can now be made. (c). Saivid Ahmad bin Ibrahim . He has continued as Minister for Internal Affairs; but has chiefly distinguished himself in the field of external affairs, where he brought to a successful close the protracted negotiations following the dispute between the Shihuh and the Jawasim in Dibah. (d). Saivid Mahmood bin Moha mmed bin Turki. He has continued as Wall of Birkah throughout the year; and though his thoughts may occasionally rest on the fact that his father was an elder brother to the Sultan's grand-father, Faisal (but excluded from the succession owing to his mental condition), it does not appear that his thoughts are in serious danger of crystallizing.8 (©)• Saivid Tarik bin Taimur . He has continued to work at Bait-al-Falaj, and is now a jemadar and in charge of the machine gun platoon; he continues to show great* keenness in his work. His private activities had at one stage a somewhat injurious effect on his health; but this has not prevented him from being married to a grand-daughter of the tfali of Nakhl. His bride had not joined him at the close of the year, and it is not known when she will be sent. (f) . ,f Mr. T.F.T. A1 Saeed ,t . He has remained in India, and at the close of the year had gone up to Poona. There have been sundry rumours of his intention^ to visit Muscat, but they appear to have only a shadowy foundation. (g) * Saivid Fahr bin Taimur . m He has continued to study at Mayo College, Ajmere, despite A the Sultan^ desire at one stage (possibly for reasons of economy rather than for the ostensible reason of dissatisfaction with Saiyid Fahr's progress) to withdraw him. (h) . Saiyid bhivab bin Fahad bin Turki . He was in France at the time of the German occupation and spent some time in a Nazi concentration camp. He was subsequently released, and when last heard of was living in Paris. The problem of getting money to him for his expenses, or to enable him to get out ^ of France, has presented considerable (and probably insuperable) difficulties. 2. TRADE AND COMMERCE . This subject has already been dealt with in Part I of this report. 3. MUNICIPALITY . The Municipality have continued to carry out general clearances and demolitions in the towns, and work on the motor road over the pass between Muscat and Matrah. Two minor public works, a laterine and a bridge (with revetment of the sides of the creek) have9 (r J been carried through. A fresh budget has been prepared, providing for several new public works, mostly of a sanitary nature. For the largest - the construction of a fish-cleaning ghat at a suitable distance away from the town of Matrah, as a preferable alternative to the foreshore - an advance is to be made from the Treasury. A new house tax is to be imposed, to provide independent funds for the Public Health department. This Department, in a single year s work in Muscat, has reduced the incidence of malaria indoor patients at the Agency Hospital to half the previous year’s number. The number of Out patients dropped by one fifth. The electric department is now to be placed under the administration of the Municipality. It has previously been managed in a general way by the Treasury, through a clerk. The Municipality is, however, a department which requires continual encouragement. 4. EDUCATION . (i) . The new primary school has made excellent progress under its Palestinian headmaster, Anwar Effendi at-Tamimi. It now goes up to the fifth standard, where the boys can do arithmetic of medium difficulty and have a good grounding in English. It is hoped to get the top class up to leaving certificate level in the course of the next year. (ii) . Six boys, who had previously been at school in Iraq, were sent to the Bahrain secondary school in the autumn. The experiment was far from a success. Apparently their experiences in Iraq had unfitted the boys for life in a school with any form of discipline; and at the end of the year their return from Bahrain was expected. (iii) . The problem of the employment of boys on leaving school has been considered, and at present the idea of training some of them as wireless operators is being pushed forward. It may also be possible to teach short hand and typing. 5. GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS . The wireless equipment ordered by the Sultan from England in January, 1940, had still not arrived at the end of the year,though it was learnt that it had been shipped on the 20th October. At the moment of writing, there is some reason to think that they may have been commandeered for military purposes on their arrival in India, though this is unconfirmed. (ii) . Two sets have, however, been locally purchased from the Officer-in-Charge, Cable &amp; Wireless Limited, and have been installed, one at Bait-al-Falaj and one at Dhofar. The State thus has now daily W/T communication with the Sultan. (iii) • Four cable interruptions took place during the year, iiiree were due to faults in the cable and one due to the diversion of the Muscat - Bushire cable to Muscat - Bahrain. (iv) . The new shortwave set installed at Muscat under the Colonial Wireless Scheme, has been tested with Royal Air Force W/T station at Shaibah, Cable &amp; Wireless W/T stations at Kuwait and Bahrain, British Overseas Airways Corporations’s W/T stations at Sharjah and Jiwani, Government Telegraph Department's W/T station at Karachi and Kastern Telegraph Company's W/T station at Aden, and satisfactory results obtained at various times of day and night. 6. POLICE » (i) . On the 1st January, 1941, the strength of the Police Force was increased to one Havildar, one Naik, three Lance Naiks and thirty Constables. This slight increase was necessary on account of the increased traffic control and night patrol duties, which are fairly heavy. (ii) . In spite of receiving many replies to an advertisement, and obtaining the assistance of the Inspector-General of Police, Sind, no suitable substitute could be found for Mr. Azizullah, the retired Superintendent. The few possible applicants all later backed out for some reason or other; and finally Mr. Mohammed Jawad Darwesh, who was originally employed as a police clerk and who had been acting as Inspector, was confirmed in his appointment. His Highness the Sultan has decided to let this arrangement11 (i # continue for the present. (iii). The discipline, which had under ivlr. Azizullah been poor has greatly improved. To avoid time wasted in training new recruits, vacancies are now filled by transfers from the Muscat Infantry. This system has proved very satisfactory. In addition to normal police work, all men are trained in the handling of a rifle and have fired a special short musketry course. 7. MUSCAT INFANTRY . The training of the Muscat Infantry has continued throughout the year under Major A.O.C. Pettyfer, Military Adviser to the Muscat Government. Discipline is good; and the standard of training is being raised, and brought into line with the Indian Army system. A signalling naik was deputed from the Indian Signs! Corps, and produced satisfactory progress before he returned to India in February. Extra men are now being trained for wireless duties on the six W/T sets which have been expected from England for many months. An artillery platoon, armed with 2.75 howitzers (mobile) and 3-pounder guns (stationary) is being trained under an Indian Artillery jemadar; and carried out practice with live shell during the year with good results. The machine gun platoon is now equipped with pack transport. The Levy owns four 30-cwt Chevrolet lorries, which have given good service throughout the year. Company and Battalion exercises have been carried out, and a short practice mobile column was done at the beginning of the year. The sick rate has remained low, with a decided degrease in malaria. A hockey tournament and a sports meeting were held during the year; and physical training parades take place twice a week. A satisfactory innovation has been a slight reduction of pay, and the issue of free rations in lieu. This has had a marked effect on the physique and energy of the men.12 8. STATE FINANCES . (i) . The revenue for the year totalled 7 lakhs, 80 thousand, or 30 thousand more than the budget figure* The expenditure was 6 lakhs, 68 thousand, or 1 thousand more than the budget figure. At the close of the year the State held over 3£ lakhs in cash and had investments of over a lakh and a third. Its nett financial position on 31st December was just 5 lakhs. (ii) . To this should be added one lakh saved from the Sultan's war subsidy, plus a reserve of perhaps 30 thousand which is under the Sultan's personal control in Dhofar. (iii) . Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain Khan, formerly treasury officer in the Muscat Agency, was appointed Finance Officer to the Muscat Government in October. He has carried out useful reorganization in audit matters, and prepared a budget for 1942 which shows material advances over previous budgets, and should lead to a general improvement in the accounting and allotment of the State revenues. The new budget adopts a very conservative figure as its anticipated revenue, but still manages to allot 44 thousand rupees to 'Reserve 9. WAR . (a) . War Measures . Towards the end of the year, the scheme for the develop ment of the South Arabian air route began to take shape, and visits to Salalah, Ras al Hadd and Masirah Island were made by aviation engineers, accompanying the Political Agent. Work was started on the landing ground at Salalah by the Sultan’s engineer; an overseer was installed at Ras al Hadd to start work on the landing ground there ; and the Muscat aerodrome was enlarged under the supervision of the Agency overseer. The visit to Masirah Island produces a satisfactory contact with the Sheikh, and reconnaissances of an aerodrome and a sea alighting area were carried out by the aii personnel. (b) . War Contributions . Contributions amounting to Rs. 15,400 were given to thePersian Gulf Fighter Fund during the year. Towards the end of-the year, a meeting was held at which British subjects agreed to continue for another year the contributions based on their imports and exports; and Muscat subjects also volunteered to make the same contributions. The ladies of some communities did useful work at knitting comforts for the troops. (c) . Publicity . The publication of A1 Haqq continued, and the Gujerati paper Satya-Samachar became a weekly publication. (d) . Defence . (i). Work on the wall ana towers has been completed during the year. Towers on the surrounding hills haj/e not been repaired, but they would afford quite good protection as they are should it be found necessary to occupy them. An additional four small sangars have been constructed by the Infantry at places considered most necessary. Repairs to Merani fort are now almost complete and the work remaining to be done is not of any vital importance from a defence point of view. (ii). Repairs to the forts along the Batinah Coast have progressed very slowly, but the essential work, such as the outer walls, have in most cases been completed. (iii). The defence launch arrived from Kuwait at the end of May. A considerable amount of work remained to be done fitting it out for use and this has recently been completed. The launch accompanied His Highness to Sur when he visited that place in August, and it also went to Dhofar in October. Recently it has carried out a reconnaissance patrol along the coast as far as Has al Hadd. The armament of the launch consists of one Maxim gun, mounted forward, and one Vickers Berthier gun, which can be used to fire in any direction. Tests so far carried out have been satisfact ory, but the gunners still require a good deal of practice. Political Agent, Muscat.14 APPENDIX “A”.
