It is not anticipated that any aircraft will visit this place, nor any fuel consignment will be sent, in the near future. A combination lock has now been obtained ±or permaneno use at this place, but again the question of difficulty in sending it and its fitting arises.

Ariel House, Strand, London, W.C.2. 14th March, 1947. Dear Harrison, t We are endeavouring to answer certain questions which have/Jtat to us by P.I.C.A.O. in regard to the P.I. C.A.O. Middle East Regional meeting. Among other things the meeting made certain recommendations on airfields in the Oman. They propose that Masirah and Salalah should be brought up to Class D strength and Class C length. At the moment they are both approximately Class E. As you are no doubt aware, the operation of the Hadramaut route by B.O.A.C. has now ceased and we are therefore proposing to reply to P.I.C.A.O. that we have no intention of undertaking any development at either of these airfields. I understand that they are at present on a care and maintenance basis as far as the R.A.F. are concerned and that they would therefore be available for civil aircraft in the case of emergency only. Before we reply to P.I.C.A.O. in the above terms we would wish to secure your concurrence. F.A.K.Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Yours &amp;c., (Sd) P.L. Brock.■p' India Office, Ext. 560/47 . Whitehall, S.W.l. 24th March, 1947. Dear Brock, Please refer to your letter No.24073/46 of 14th March regarding the recommendation at the P.I.C.A.O. Middle East Regional meeting that Masirah and Salalah aerodromes should be brought up to Class D strength and Class C length. 2. The position at the moment is that we are in the process of negotiating a Civil Air Agreement with the Sultan of Muscat (who is an independent Ruler) which would give His Majesty's Government the exclusive rights to maintain these aerodromes as the Sultan's agents. The proposal is that the R.A.F. should maintain the aerodromes and provide at least the minimum requirements necessary to keep the aerodromes open for occasional use by civil aviation. Ratcliffe-Cousins in your Ministry is familiar with all this. 3. Until the Agreement is concluded, however, it would be premature to inform P.I.C.A.O. of the above and we suggest that any reply at the moment should be confined to saying that His Majesty's Government do not at present contemplate any developments for civil aviation purposes at either of the aerodromes beyond existing standards. 4. Incidentally we should be glad to know the reasons for P.I.C.A.O's recommendations for improving the standard of these aerodromes, as we had understood that there was little prospect of civil aviation needs developing on this route. Perhaps you would be good enough to send us a copy of the relevant part of the report of the meeting. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter and yours under reply to Low at the Air Ministry and Muirhead at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, P.L. Brock, Esq., (Sd) F.A.K. Harrison.

Dear Harrison, Thank you very much for your letter 560/47 of the 24th March regarding Masirah and Salalah• The papers of the Middle East Regional meeting show that it was envisaged that there would be two move ments per week in each direction through these two airfields. One service per week was the B.O.A.C. Hadramaut service which has since been discontinued* It is questionable whether these projected frequencies justify the recommend ations in regard to these airfields which were made* In general the recommendations of the meeting were somewhat lavish and this tendency has been corrected at subsequent Regional meetings* We propose to inform FibAO as you suggest that we do not at present contemplate any develop ments for civil aviation purposes beyond existing standards at either Masirah or Salalah.

So far as 1 am aware, however, the Political Agent has not been specified as the authority to exercise this right on behalf of His Majesty's Government and ai a result of the experience of the past few months, 1 am inclined to the opinion that his doing so leads to unnecessary delays, expense, and confusion, since it is the Royal Air Force who are responsible for operating the aerodrome, and only they aro in possession of the latest information regarding its operational fitness, and facilities available for refuellii^, feeding, accommodation etc. un the whole therefore 1 feel that wo could appropriately suggest that li the Air officer Commanding Aden should exercise the authority granted to His Majesty's Government under Article 4 of the Agreement rather than the Political Agent though perhaps it may be desirable to stipulate that he shall inform the political Agent of all authorisations so granted or rejected. 3. if you agree perhaps it would be possible for you to take the matter up with the Commonwealth Relations Office so / that The Hon'ble Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.2 - that the Civil Aviation ’'apartmont can bo ro ( 4 Uostcd to one ore that all future references are sont direct to the Air Officer Corananding and not the Political Agent.

We usually pass such notificat ions on to you or the Political Agent, Bahrain by telegram. 2 . We understand that the procedure in force is that the foreign company concerned requests permission from the Ministry of Civil Aviation to make their flight, with landings at certain specified aerodromes. In the case of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf the Ministry of Civil Aviation say that they inform you direct by telegram if the aircraft is British or Dominion, but ask us to notify you if the aeroplane belongs to a foreign country. They also state that you are the sole channel of communication between the Ministry of Civil Aviation and aerodromes concerned. However, they agree that it is normal for a foreign company making: a flight firstly, to ascertain that the aerodrome or aerodromes concerned arc capable of receiving the type of machine they are using and, second ly for the pilot of the aeroplane to request permission to land at the next aerodrome before leaving the one from which he started. 3. In the case of commercial charter flights, it is not necessary, I think, for the permission of any of the Gulf Rulers to be obtained for landings at aerodromes in their territories. You may, however, none the less consider it desirable that we, or the Ministry of Civil Aviation, should continue, as at present to notify you by telegram in all cases. Would you kindly let us know whether you consider the present procedure satisfactory, or whether there is any variation which you would wish to suggest. Yours sincerely, Sd/- F.a.K. Harrison. Lt.Col.

Dear Harrison, Thank you for your letter of the 3rd February (Ext.293/ 48 ), with which you enclosed a copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, referring to the statement made by Mr .Hampton that B.O.A. C. were about to start a landplane service to Australia and the Far East calling at Masirah Island* 2. I think Hampton has got hold of the wrong end of the stick* It is true that several years ago a service between the U.K. and Australia was planned to operate London-Lydda- Masirah~0eylon-6 ingap ore -Darw i n-Sydney-Auckla nd* This, however, was a very long term project which is unlikely to materialise for some time to cccie, if at all. 3* B.O.A*C* have, however, recently suggested that they should operate their Bombay terminating service through Masirah, so as to avoid calling en route at Karachi. The proposal was considered here and, in view of the very considerable cost involved since Masirah would be required only for a short period until longer range aircraft were available, it has been decided to drop the idea. Instead of Masirah, B*O.A*C* are now considering routeing the Bombay terminating service through Dhahran which, although not so good as Masirah froa the stage distance point of view, would serve the piarpose at much less cost. 4* I am sending copies of this letter to Low at the Air Ministry and pyman at the Foreign Office.

Civil Air Attache in the Middle East British Embassy Cairo Monthly Newsletter No. 1/48 January. PEARCE PROJECT CONFIDENTIAL , c aHF The Director of Civil Aviation Aden recently interviewed Mr W.R. Pearce in connection with the latter’s projected intention to establish an.air-charter company at Aden operating with c.46 aircraft. Mr Pearee’s present object is to discover on what conditions such a company could be granted landing and operating rights in Aden. Details of his ' proposals have been submitted to the Foreign Office, and the official attitude towards Mr Pearce's project is therefore as yet still undecided. Details of the project are as follows MIDDLE EAST GENERAI/ADEN/PARAGRAPH 5(i) (i) Mr W.R. Pearce is an American employed by Ethiopian Airlines and an ex T.W.A. employee. Associated with him in the project is another E.A.L. ex. T.W.A. employee named Joha H Russell, who is at present said to be in the United States collate ing aircraft statistics and other relevant data. (ii) The project cortemplates operating with Curtiss Commando's bought from United States surplus military stocks, incorporating inter alia, modifications to hydraulic and fuel tanks systems designed to reduce air-risks. The plan is to bring in two of these aircraft at the outset, eventually increasing the fleet to five. Wayfarers would eventually replace the C. 46's (iii) The main object of the Company WHHistxxissxfc* initially would be freight on the Addis Ababa/Aden route . The Company would also be interested in charter freight operations to Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, East Africa, Saudi Arabia and India, but would not be interested in passengers except during the pilgrimage season. (iv) The Company would not be American controlled in any way. The pilots and ground staff would be international. Mr Pearce was informed by the D.C.A. that any traffic right in Aden could only be granted to a British controlled company. If Pearcels Company would be registered and capitalised in Aden then this pre-requisite would be fulfilled. Mr Pearce was also informed that the volume of traffic on any particular xsi route he contemplated operating should be such that duplication of already existing service was economically justifiable. Taking into consideration the fact that the Pearce project is aiming to freight hitherto untouched air-cargo, this condition would also appear to be fulfilled. (v) The curre^y position, the supply of spare parts, and the servicing of the aircraft was also discussed by Mr Pearce and the D.C.A. (vi) The R.A.F. have stated that they do not object® to Pearce's scheme. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, dated the 12/l9th March 1948.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 126 of the 27th April 1948, enclosing, for my information, a copy of the text of an agreement between His Majesty * s Government in the United Kingdom and the oultan of Muscat and Oman, and to inform you. that the question of interpretation of, and obligations under,the agreement has arisen in connection with the refuelling of civil aircraft on this route. 2. The position is that until recently the R.A.F. kept sufficient stocks of petrol at Masirah to refuel occasional civil aircraft which might pass through Masirah en route for Aden from India. The rapid development of this South Arabian route, particularly in connection with the pilgrim traffic, has raised civil requirements of a viation spirit ,at Kasirah beyond the R.A.F's ability to supply without 1 some special arrangement. As a result of thi a.the, Director of Civil Aviation, in consultation witrll Headquarters, British Forces, Aden, informed various Companies who were proposing to operate charter services involving refuelling at Masirah, that the R.A.F. could no longer supply fuel, but that there was no objection to promoters making arrangements to deliver fuel to Masirah for their own use. Advantage has been taken of this concession by Ethiopian Airlines and also, it is understood by Indian Overseas Airlines. It now appears that under the agreement referr ed to above Kis Majesty's Government have agreed that they alone will, through their appointed agents, manage and operate the three airfields in the territory of the Sultan, and that it is possible that the Sultan could regard the concession to these airlines to make their own refuelling arrangements at Masirah as a breacho f the agreement. The R.A.F., who operate the airfield on His Majesty's Government's behalf, do not consider that they are called upon to keep stocks of fuel at Masirah specially for civilian needs particularly as the cost of getting it there is high. 3. In these circumstances, I should be grateful if the position with regard to implied obligations under the agreement could be clarified. 4. Although this matter is not the concern of the Aden Government directly, the facts that the management of the Masirah airfield is vested in the Air Officer Commanding, Headquarters, British Forces, Aden, and that operators of civil airlines make their approach for facilities through this Government make it essential that I should be in possession of this information. / It The Right Honourable Arthur Creech Jones, M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies, LOUDON£ 5* It seems clear that the difficulties would largely disappear if I'essrs.

These folios together with the file notes found in folios 159 and 160 seem to have been misplaced from another file numbered II/13-3 (c), and inserted in this file.The rest of the file (ff 13-158) with file notes (ff 161-170) contains the actual correspondence that belongs to file number '2/15 Masirah and Salalah Air Fields (Charter Flights).' The correspondence is dated 1947-1948 and it is mainly related to the procedure required in order to obtain the Sultan of Muscat and Oman’s permission for charter flights to fly over his territories, and to use the landing grounds for refuelling, as in accordance with the Muscat Air Agreement. The main charter flights to use the landing ground facilities were Ethiopian Airlines between Addis Ababa and Bombay, and Indian Airways between India and East Africa.The file also includes correspondences related to: the development of the airfields at Salalah and Masirah; the availability of land rescue facilities along the South Arabian Coast; and the Sultan’s request for customs duty to be paid by the RAF at Masirah and Salalah for the supply of aviation fuel to civil aircrafts.The main correspondents in the file are: the Royal Air Force Headquarters, Iraq; the Political Agency, Muscat; the Political Residency, Bahrain; the British Consul General, Addis Ababa; the Foreign Office, London; the Ministry of Air Aviation, London; the Commonwealth Relations Office, London; and the Government of India (Independent India).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Salalah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Civil Air Agreement (1947)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Civil Air Agreement (1934)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>AHQ Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Masirah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Air services agreements</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002e4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
