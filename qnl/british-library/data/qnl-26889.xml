A Previous papers :— 3330 1000 12.34 The Muscat Infantry was originally formed to replace the Indian Regiment formerly stationed at Muscat, to afford useful hacking to the State authoritiesto increase their ^ prestige in the eyes of their neighbours, and to defend Muscat and Muttra against possible raids from Omani tribesmen. The value of the corps was probably political rather than military, and it did much valuable work in road-making, but such work was not intended to detract from its military efficiency which was supposed to be adequate to deal with any minor troubles. 2. The precarious state of Muscat finances has necessitated a policy of economy which left its mark on the personnel and efficiency of the troops. Major Bremner’s rather gloomy report probably/probably gives a true picture of the state of affairs, but Colonel Jj’owle seems to have taken the right line both with the officers and the Sultan, and it is to be hoped that at least the misuse of the corps by State officials will cease.

Dated the 7th June, 1935• I enclose herewith copy of a letter, No• C/56 of 13th February 1935, from Brenner, on the subject of the Muscat Infantry. Owing to other preoccupations, and much touring, I have been unable to deal with this letter before, but the matter was not particularly urgent as since it was written I was able to visit Muscat and discuss the matter with Bremer • a recent letter which 1 wrote to Laithwaite (with a copy to you) asking him if he would very kindly approach some of the Home Deportments with a view to getting a suitable officer.

But the better class which he suggests will not enlist for the rate of pay which the State offers,(para* graphs 5*13 of his letter). for the State, which has only recently been saved from bankruptcy, to have offered higher rates of pay.

Bremner, M.C., Political Agent &amp; H.B*M T s Consul, Muscat. To The Hon f ble the Political Resiaeat, Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject The Muscat Infantry. Sir, I have the honqr^u to a duress you on the above subject, which in view of your approaching visit to Muscat you may wish to discuss with His Highness the Sultan. 2. As you are aware tne latter, before leaving for India in October last, re^uesteu me ”to be good enough to lock after his Corps till such time as a suitable Commandant was appointed'. Alt .ough this adued a considerable burden to my already sufficient duties, I agreed to ao so and nave thus been afforded a signal opportunity of observing .ne difficulties which normally confront tne Commanuant. 3. itmongst many lesser points, the following came strikingly to notice. (a) The Corps, as a fighting unit, is of little or no value. (b) Its present composition militates against it ever becoming really efficient as a fighting unit. (c) The misconception that appears to exist among various Government Departments as to what the Corps and its machinery exist for and consequently the uemands that are made on the Corps. 4. Reraruin^ (aj Training . Qn taking over 'active' as opposed to 'supervisory' %charge of the Corps it was quickly apparent that the military training hitherto received hy the Corps has been cu. a most perfunctory nature. Other than on guard duty apparently no N-C-0* had. even been given charge of as much as a squad to handle on parade, and not a single N.C*0« was cognisant of the simplest drill parade exercises or orders, let alone field work. This necessitated a commencement ab inititio of a ? en but, without instructions and with the material at one T s disposal, this has oeen found exceedingly difficult. Without going into detail it will suffice to say that classes have been instituted for N.G.Os and ever,/ endeavour has been made to»include some idea oi elementary training into themen. A smali beginning has been maae with freild work, but the Corps as a whole is not yet fit to leave the suuare. 5* AjL regards ( b) Composition . The Corps at present consists of 37 Mekranis and 107 locally enlisted men (some 8 Arabs and the remainder 'Baluchis')* 6. (fiose scrutiny of the former element reveals tnat the men belong mostly to fighting classes, but only some half dosen can be alassified tribaliy as first class Baluchis-* 7. None the less the Mekrani is infinitely superior in every way to the local Baluch. lie shows an aptitude for military training, his rausketr is good, ana wnijst his , xX ' A general conduct and discipline is excellent, he is far ^ superior in inteileCo wo me iw*cai man. 8. Of the local 'Baluch' element a large number are 'shiais' - i.e. of slave origin. It has be^n impossible to trace tne clans of the majority of the remainder as the men tnemseives are ignorant of tiieir ancestrial tribes. Suffice it to say that they ar e all townsmen, norn and bredo — o»“* in Muscat and Matraii, neither of irhich are productive of lighting classes’ 1 or true tribesmen. f fhey are conse.uently devoid of the inborn instincts of the lighting men. 9. Combined with an extremely low standard oi intelligence the prozimity cf their nomes and the sordid environments from which they originate uoes not tend to convert uhe local elements into suitable material for a fighting Corps. 10. As n consequence tx^eir training is exceeeingly difficult and what the men learn one day, they forget, the next. What has often been tola me quietly b„ locally enlisted men themselves would appear to have a certain semblance of truth - i.e. ’’those that ir ven ! t the wit to get a better ’’living elsewhere join the Levy Corps to do a minimum of ’’work and to live at home' • Whatever may be thefacts, certain it is that the local element is the despair of the I-Os oi the Corps. 11. With a to improving these defects tentative efforts have been made to search out better local types but no success nas been met with. 12. The only other alternative to effect improvement would appear to be an increase in tne Mekrani element. Heie again however several obstacles present themselves the cniei oi which are (1) additional expense (2) the difiiculty oi obtaining £rood types on the present rates oi pay amd the entire lack of any tribal system in the Corps. 13. Assuming that it might eventually be possible to meet (1) above, opportunity was taken of his presence in Muscat to consult Mir Mahmud Khan Gitchki son of S-B-Mir Mehrab Khan, late Sarhaaeuar of Mekran, as to the possibility oi obtaining good types of Baluchi tribesmen ior the Corps. His reply, a copy of ehich is atiacheu her with, is self explanatory. The matter has accordingly be^n held in abeyance ior-4- the tine beiug. 14. Re^arain^ (c). The misuse oi the Corps. Hitherto the training of me Corps for iviilitary purposes has purely been secondary toaits other functions, and it would appear t^at in practice the various Departments of the local Government regard tue Corps as merely efe being for general utility purposes, whilst the Sultan appears to regard it as a sueful sup ly Arsenal for obtaining modern rifles for distribution to his .laves and ot er Civil / \ \ / personnel. 15. Thus the motor lorry ana dirver, wit out the consulta tion of the C®^iaandant, are suadeily com.andeerec by telephonic orders received from;the Ministry of Revenue or the Municipality, and when r uireo for Corps sue are 1 f \\ nowhere to be found. i \ Orders eminating from the Police Department are issued demanding one supply of clothing, sandals etc.'immediately’’. The ^ultan issued orders for the immediate delivery to himself of large numbers 6f latest rifles, which have been expressely ordered for tne Muscat Infantry to replace obsolete patterns, d A fatigue party is required - 'apply to the Levies'. 16. Mot onoy is the training of the Cnrps interfered with, but discipline is undermined and the I.Qs are at a loss to know under whose orders they are to act. if they fail to carry jut an order conveyed by telephone by some underling, t^ey may find themselves accused of disobeying His Highness’s orders. Of on the other hand they carry an order out ana subsequently somutiling miscarries, they, and not the person who telephoned the order, are held responsible. 17. Apart from this^ the expenses incurred in such items as appear in paragraph 15 are all debited to the already greatly reduced Corps Budget instead of bie-abeing borne(*The proposedby the Departments concernea or, in t e case of arms, beinp- budget for 1935 shows paid by the Sultan himself, a further reduc tion under the On the other nand any small items requires for the head or Infantry of beneiit of the Corps or its personnel it queried or some Ps.4000) rejected, principally at the instigation of the Direcotr Revenues. 18. Opportunity has not afiordeu of bringing these matters to the oultanls notice since his return from India on the 6th February but, in view of what has been brought to your notice elsewhere in a separate report, it is doubtful if he will take any steps to ameliorate the present state of afmrs.

A • C • I have th received your kind favour and 1 will consider it an nonour ana incumbent upon me to render service to you. I deem it my duty to bring to Your Honour’s notice the fact that each man of Mekran nevey Corps gets Rs.18 plus 30 seers of ilour per mensem. Pension is also granted to him after a service of 18 years. It is them very difficult to obtain at the rate of Rs.20 and the ration which is given to the Muscat Infantry for such a distant place as Muscat wher^ foodstuffs are much more dearer than in any part of Baluchistan men of good family who in my opinion are fit for military service and remain firm in critical times* There is no doubt that men can be recruitea for Rs. 20 just to complete the strength of Muscat Levy but I do not think that they would serve any useful purpose as the object of men of this type who leave their homes and go to such a distant place for Rs.20 is nothing but to get their daily bread. You are well aware of the condition of the soldiers in general ana of the Dhob Militia and Mekran Levy Corps ia particular. The management of the affairs of each platoon is entrusted to an Indian Officer who will make proposal for the re .uirements of his platoon to the Commanding Officer and according to his officer’s instructions he will train and fix up the duties of the young men of his platoon. But this system does not exist in the Muscat Infantry. I have stated the real fact but I am prepared to be guided by your advice.

On one occasion their condition was sc stremely miserable that they had to be abandoned and the troops sheltered it the inner verandahs of Bet-al-lalaj itself. Detachments were wording on the road to Boshar and their condition was also a sodden one as they were shelterea in *aan rt h^ts, totally Incapable of Keeping out the rain. Ail this caused a fairly high percentage of ialaria and there were, unfortunately, several deaths from Pneumonia. Since then, the substitution of tents for the rt dan w huts has made the lot of outside detachments batter than that of men left in the lines* The issue of excellent thic* woollen jerseys has also given the troops some protection against chill. Greatcoats are only available for guards and sentries. On the whole the general health has been excellent with the exception of this period. gub llc Works* As far as the lines are concerned the most important work done has been the opening oi the Xjutts iaiaj from its source in the tanx into a properly builtbuilt *aL9r*a/, Previously it ran underground under the hut used as a Soda Water Factory and the mosque* This channel %as the breeding place oi' thousands of mosquitos.

Leave has now been standardised at tfco months irrespective of whether the leave is granted in Fuscat or r&amp;adur or Mekran. This allows for the change over iii of platoons and allows the individual training of the men, carried out in the leave season to be done with their own platoons. Terms,_of_Service.

The men soon proved themselves expert and willing workers at this form of labour. They show an e^ual keenness in Held training and I consider that a few periods of intensive training in camp would soon bring them up to a very satisfactory standard of training. Discipline has been well maintained. For this the unfailing vigilance ana tact of the Indian Officers is largely responsible. Sports. The men are keen on hockey and sports. The Levy’s chief opponents are the sloops of the Persian Gulf Division B.N. These games are always fought out in the very best spirit. Annual sports are held at which considerable enthusiasm is shown* This last year the sports were rendered much more interesting by the participation of H.l’.S.'Cyclanen* in them, nonours were fairly evenly divided. An immense cro»d turned up from Muscat and fatrah to watch them.

Before commenting on Mr, Hedgcock's letter, I will trace briefly for the information of the Government of India the sequence of events since Mr. Kedgcock took over charge of his present appointment. Mr. Hedgcock assumed charge on the 1st January last, and was apparently horrified at the financial condition of the state, which he described as being bankrupt. He accordingly came to the conclusion that, if the budget was to balance, drastic economies must be effected, and he further decided that the Levy Corps were greatly over paid and before any other economies could be effected it was essential that the pay of the levies should be reduced, and he demanded from the Commandant a reduction of Rs. 21,000 in/in tl]e Levy tm&amp;get, 'bat stipulated further that the basic pay of the sepoy, which was fixed at Rs # 30/- per mensem, must be reduced by Rs.5/-, contending that otherwise he would be unable to call on other departments to make sacrifices. Prolonged discussions took place between himself and Captain YJalker and, the latter under protest and because he was told that the state was bankrupt, finally agreed to this proposal, but stated that it would produce discontent and affect the morale of the Corps. 3. Early in February, I arrived in Muscat and came to the conclusion that so drastic a cut in the men 1 s pay was not justified, either by the terms of their contract, or by the financial position of the state. For many years past the condition of the Muscat State might have been described by a financial purist as one of bankruptcy, but I was hope ful that the reduction in His Highness 1 allowance, increase of revenue from a revised tariff and the more efficient control of the customs in Sohar and Sur and other measures might produce an increase of revenue, aid I did not consider that it was fair to the serving-men of the Corps to effect such a large reduction in their pay. 4. I discussed the matter at considerable length with Captain Walker and Mr. Hedgcoek, and it was finally agreed that a cut should be made in the basic pay of Rs.E/- and further that a reduction of rates of good-conduct pay should also be effected, the total reduction in many cases therefore being Rs. 4/-. The reduction in the basic pay could be justified on the ground of the fall in the cost of living, ard Captain Walker assured me that this reduction would not create/-3- create any discontent in the Corps, I may mention tliat the original sanctioned strength of the Corps was 240, and it has now 'been reduced to 150; no further reduction in the number of personnel was therefore possible if the Corps was to retain any value as a fighting force. Captain Walker further agreed to effect many other reductions in the number of followers and non-combatant personnel and a total reduction in the levy budget of Rs.12,000 was agreed to. I also stated my willing ness, not as stated in Mr. Hedgcock's letter, to agree to a further cut in pay later on, but, if the financial position made it absolutely necessary, to consider further economies in the Levy Corps towards the close of the current year. 5. I left Muscat in the belief that the matter had been settled and accepted by both parties. Shortly after my return, however, to my surprise I receivod a letter from the Political ^gent to the effect that the Council now stated that the financial position was worse than had been anticipated and informing me that the Council asked for a further cut in the men’s pay. This request was supported by no figures, but merely by some isolated notes from Mr. Hedgcock, showing there had been a decline in the customs receipts. The Political Agent did not support the request. I considered however that it would be desirable to give a considered reply to the Council and I therefore instructed the Political Agent to obtain from Mr. Hedgcock a revised budget estimate to substantiate the contention that the finances of the state did actually necessitate such drastic measures. Communications with Muscat are very slow and it takes at the shortest three weeks to get a reply from there, and by this time it was the end of March and I left for Delhi on a visit to the Government of India. I had submitted a report regarding the reductions in the/-4- the Levy budget to tiie Government of India - vide my despatch IJ0.99-S, dated the 5th March 1931. I had however made no official report of this further request of the Council to the Government of India, since the piece-meal figures supplied to me gave me no material for doing so, but I discussed the matter verbally with the Government of India and was given to understand that my action was generally approved, though a further cut was deprecated. 6. iUrther, while at Delhi, the question arose of a successor for Captain Walker, the Commandant of the Levy Corps. Captain Walker was anxious to proceed on leave without delay and difficulties were experienced in obtaining a successor for him. I therefore suggested that with a view to still further assisting the finances of the state, the post of Commandant should be left vacant for 4 months. During the summer the men are given furlough and the Commandant normally proceeds on recess to India for about E months and, in the special circumstances of the case, I considered it feasible that the post should be left vacant for 4 months. This would effect a further economy of Rs. 5000, making Rs. 17,000 in all as against the Rs. El,000 originally asked for by Mr. Eedgcock. On my way back from Karachi to Bushire I received a telegram from the Political Agent informing me that Mr. Eedgcock had resigned his appointment, though, as reported in my tele gram referred to above, he has subsequently agreed to postpone a definite decision in the matter for a month. 7. I now come to Mr. Eedgcock’s letter of the 10th April to the Political Agent and to his letter of resigna tion addressed to the President of the Council. I can only say that I consider these two documents extremely unfortunately/H- I 1 -5- unfortanately worded. Mr. Hedgeock states that the only reasons given to him for not sanctioning the full reduction in pay demanded hy him were sentimental ones. The reasons have been given above and cannot be so described. He refers to the second cut promised by me; as stated above I never promised a second cut. I merely said that, if the financial position towards the end of the year showed it to be absolutely necessary, I would give further economies my consideration. In the latter letter Mr. Hedgeock refers to the divergence of opinion between the Government of India and himself; this should, of course, be the Political Hesident and himself. When I went to Muscat Mr. Hedgeock had been there one month and many of his figures were obviously provisional; since then I have been endeavouring to get figures out of him in support of his various contentions, but as Major Fowle states, he has only produced them in piece-meal form, which conveyed nothing, and it is only with considerable difficulty that Major Fowle has at length succeeded in obtaining from him some sort of revised budget estimate. 8. I think Mr. Hedgcock f s reference to the Government of India, in his letter to the President of the Council, is most unfortunate. It is hardly calculated to improve the relations subsisting between Government and the State, who will naturally draw the conclusion that the financial woes from which they suffer are entirely due to the hard-hearted- ness and lack of sympathy of the British authorities whereas, of course, the exact reverse is the case, and no state owes more to the British Government at the present moment than the state of Oman. 9. As stated above, Mr. Hedgeock demanded a cut of Rs.El,000, and has been given economies amounting, during the current/- 6 - IT oarrent year, to at least Rs.17,000* He asks however not merely that the economy should amount to a certain figure hut should he effected in the particular way that he prescribes and totally fails to recognise that he has been met, in my opinion, most liberally and sympathetically, 10. In the penultimate paragraph of his letter Mr. Hedgcock refers to his disagreement with the apparent policy of the Government of India on more fundamental issues. What these fundamental issues are I have not the least knowledge, unless it be that the Muscat State should be absolute master in its own house and should be at liberty to abolish or reduce the Levy Corps as it thinks fit. If this is correct, the answer is that the Muscat State looks to the British Government to defend it from external enemies, and as long as this is the case, the British Government have a reasonable right to ask that the state should maintain such a force as will enable it to deal, at any rate, with minor troubles. 11. Hot having obtained his demands in toto, Mr. Hedgcock has apparently adopted what I can only describe as an attitude of sulkiness and lias made little or no further attempt to improve the resources of the state. When I was in Muscat he laid great stress on the fact that he hoped to obtain largely increased revenues from the rich date-producing Batineh coast. The control of this coast had for many years past been in the hands of one Saiyid Hamid, a brother of the Sultan, who had paid less and less revenues into the central treasury till during the last year he only remitted Rs.1800. Saiyid Hamid had further adopted a most contumacious attitude towards the Council, and had refused to acknowledge their authority. Mr. Hedgcock informed me that he thought the revenue obtainable from this district should amount to about Rs.30,000/I 1 -7- Rs.30,000* Last Marcii, Saiyid Said, the heir-apparent, proceeded personally to Sohar with an escort of the Levy Corps g nri removed Saiyid Hamid, thereby asserting the authority of the Council. Then, surely, was the time for Mr. Hedgcock to proceed to Sohar to examine and reorganise the finances of that district, hut it will he seen from Major Fowle’s letter that he declines to do so and talks vaguely of proceed ing there in the autumn. Similarly it will he seen that he refused to accompany the Political Agent to Gwadur although the latter offered to arrange a passage for him in a sloop. IE. When I was in Muscat, Mr. Hedgcock informed me that he was urging on Saiyid Said the desirability of mailing cuts in the family allowances, hut apparently owing to the fact that the pay of the levies has not been reduced to the extent that Mr. Hedgcock demanded this idea has been given up, and doubtless now that he lias been informed by his financial adviser that the woes of the state are due to the unsympathetic attitude of the Government of India, Saiyid Said will not take any steps to introduce such unpopular measures. 13. I consider Mr. Hedgcock's conduct has been deplorable. I have done my best to assist him and have, I consider, met him more than half way, but he lias totally failed to recognise the fact and has done his best to make relations betvjeen the Government of India and the State as difficult as possible. I consider that by hi s conduct he has shown himself temperamentally unfitted for the appointment. It is essential that the appointment should be held by an officer with an equable temperament, with a reasonable spirit of give and take and, finally, with considerable tact. In all these qualities Mr. Hedgcock seems to be lacking. I therefore recommend that I should be authorised to advise the Council to accept his resignation. /1 * - 8 - resignation* 14. If tliis re comae ndat ion is approved, it is necessary to consider the arrangements to he made for the future. Captain .Alban is proceeding shortly to Muscat to officiate as Political jkgent. He held the dual appointment of Commandant of the Levies and Financial idviser during 19E3 for over a year, and later in 1925 he officiated as Political .agent. During this period he gained a very wide knowledge of the state. He has travelled extensively through the whole area within which the writ of Muscat runs, and knows the country and the people, and has also a thorough knowledge of the system of administra tion. Farther, he is an officer of exceptional zeal and energy. 15. I consider it undesirable in principle that the political Agent should combine the duties of Financial hdviser, though, I believe, that in practice, when Ivlr. Wingate was Political Agent there, he did exercise a very large measure of financial control. I propose therefore, subject to the approval of the Government of India, to inform the Council that it will not be possible to find a Financial Adviser at once, but that Captain ^klban, whom they already know well, will assist them with his advice while acting as Political Agent. In the autumn when Major Fowle resumes the appointment of Political Agent I would recommend that Captain ji.lban should be appointed Financial Adviser and should also as a trial measure, at any rate, command the levies, as stated above he has exceptional qualifications for these posts and has already combined these two functions for more than a year, and I am convinced that he will perform the work efficiently and with great keenness and zeal and, if any one can restore the state to a condition of solvency, I am confident that it is he. In/k 1 16. In case there should he any difficulty about making the services of an officer of the Political Department avail able for an extra cadre appointment, I would mention that I have already suggested that an officer not on the cadre of the Political Department should be appointed to relieve Captain Bradshaw, my Secretary, when the latter goes on leave in the autumn. 17. It is desirable that a decision should be come to in this matter as soon as possible. It is no use keeping on, longer than can be helped, an officer in the state who is obviously dissatisfied and is making but little attempt to improve the finances of the state, and the longer the situation lasts the worse will it become. I would therefore solicit orders by telegram. 18. I am sending a copy of this despatch by air mail to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd/- H.Y. Biscoe, Lt.Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. P.S. In reading through this despatch. I have discovered a slight inaccuracy which I should like to correct. The economies in the Levy Corps were introduced with effect from the 1st March, and therefore the full reduction of Rs. 12,000 v/ill not be made during the current year: the Muscat financial year is the same as the calendar year. The reduction of expenditure during the current year will amount to about Rs.l5,000/~, i•e.Rs.10,000/- permanent reduction, and Rs.5000/- owing to absence of Commandant. «i BY AIR MAIL .

An interesting despatch, containing the recommendations of the Political Resident in the light of proposals by the Commandant of the Muscat laxncAi cowMiTTfli. 2 9 DEC 1930 Previous Papers Levy Corps and the Political Agent, Muscat, on the future of the Corps. The Resident recomends that the Corps should not be further reduced beyond its present strength of one British officer, three Indian officers, and 150 rank and file. He further agrees with the recommendations of the local officers that its composition / should remain,as at present, Baluchi. Certain connected suggestions for re arming it with modem short rifles at the rate of 20-30 annually, and for the provision of two Vickers and three Lewis 4407 b 1000 3.30( S ^ Q guns are also supported by him. The value of the Levy Corps is probably essentially political rather than military, though it affords a useful backing to the State authorities. It has in recent years been considerably employed on road making. Th present expenditure is Rs. l$2ooo x The Resident considers that the comparatively small increase/involved [is one which the State can afford, and recoirmends that they should be informed that they are expected to maintain the Corps at the strength set out above, and to make the necessary financial provision, no reduction in strength or expenditure being permissible without previous consultation with the Political Agent. The statement in paragraph 8 of the Resident’s despatch that ’’there has been a considerable increase in the customs receipts at Sur during the last two months’* is of interest. . 1/s i-'/s (CtmcAi coi«Mirns% 2 S DEC 1930 7z^&gt; i 2 V rt i Camp, Muscat' 1 , dated 27th November 19 3C.

To The Hon’ble the political Resident In the Persian Gulf, Bushire. SUBJECT:- Policy for Nmsoat Levy Corps . Memorandum . The attached letter from captein Walker is the result of a conversation which I had with him on the subject of a general policy for the Muscat Levy. I asked Captain Walker to put hie ideas down in paper when we could discuss the whole matter with you on your approaching visit. necessity for policy * 2. Like most Political Officers I have had some experience of Levies, and have been impressed oy the neces sity not only of laying down a general policy for a Levy, but of reviewing this policy from time to time to see if any alterations in it, or in the Levy itself, are needed to meet changing circumstances. Object of the &gt;T uscat Levy Corps . 3 . The objectsof the luscat Levy Corps were laid down in Political Agent, Muscat's , ( Mr.Yfingate's), letter « r of the 30th April to the Civil commissioner, Baghdad:- (1) To allow of the withdrawal of the Indian Regiment then stationed here.b . . « . (2) To make the Sultanas Government efficient and strong in the eyes of the Omanis. (3) To provide for the defence of Muscat and Muttra against possible raids from Omani tribesmen. Mr.Wingate added that attacks on the coasts eould always be dealt with by one of H.‘'.ships• 4 # These principles were accepted by Government as forming the raison d’etre of the corps, and I am of opinion that they can be still taken as such. They would appear definitely to rule out any idea of the Corps having garrisons in any other centres except Bait al PalaJ , Muttra and Muscat. If garrisons are required elsewhere the Corps must be in creased in numbers or the Sultan must make other arrange ments* Kor in my opinion could the Corps be expected to undertake military expeditions away from Bait al Falaj. If such expeditions are contemplated then the strength of the Corps must be considerably increased. I mention this latter point as in tome despatches by Political Agents stress is laid on the necessity of the ,orps being pobile ( Mr.Wingate himself uses this expression in his letter quoted above) which would seem to indicate some idea in the minds of writers that the Corps might be required to under take such expeditions. Captain Walker also in his letter under reference ( para 4 ) states ^ if made highly eificient and mobile it could tackle any smaller trouble likely to be met with in the Batineh*. My assumption, however, is that the Corps at its present strength is a purely garrison one for Bait al Falaj to cover Muscat and Muttra from attack May I take it that you concur in this by Omani tribes, assumption? Strength of the Levy .5 Strength of the Levy * Captrin Walker points out that since the Levy was started in 1921 its strength has gradually decreased. Mr. Wingate suggested a maximum of 300 and a minimum oi 200 men# It now consists of about 150. On the assumption that the object of the corps is as stated above what is the minimum strength at which it should stand? To answer this question we must ask another* what would be the strength of an Omani raid on Muttra and Muscat which it would have to meet? If the raid were made on a very large scale* say 2000 or 3000 men, then of course only a large Levy Corps of perhaps 1000 ( the Indian regiment here numbered that) could deal with it. But such a raid is extremely unlikely, and such a large Corps is completely outside the financial capability of the ^tate. Excluding such a raid then, whet should be the size o of the force? This is not an easy question to answer, understand that Captain 1 alker would be satisfied with a minimum of 150 men, which he considers is the very last economical strength* I concur in this. Has it your approval? If so then we must see to it that the strength of the corps remains at thst figure coute qui coute. There must no longer be any question of cutting the Corps down bevond that point because of financial stringency in the Btate . The cost of the Levy must be absolutely the first charge on the State Treasury, and no matter what other economies have to be made no reduction of the Corps will be permitted. Composition . 6* In his letter quoted above Mr.Wingate stated that one of the essentials of the Corps was that it should not be Arab. * in other words', he stated, M what is wanted is a small highly-paid and well-trained and loyal body of cut throat mercenaries with no ties in the country in which they serve and no love for the Arab. It is no use blinkingblinking this fact”* Without subscribing to the necessity of the Levies being expert cut-throats, I concur they should be composed of elements which have no love for the Arab. The Corps is a at present entirely composed of Baluchis recruited from various parts of the Sultan 9 a dominion. Fay I presume that you concur that this composition should contiRVie? Armament . 7. This is a somewhat technical question on which I am not prepared to speak in detail. captain alker gives his opinion in hie attached letter. The Government of India may possibly make objections to arming the force with the modern short rifle. On general principles, having regard to the small size of the force - only 150 men - it is obvious that they should be armed as well as possible. Road making and Military training . 8. As Caplin talker explains in para 5 and 6 of his letter the Lefy hns engaged in a great deal of road making. This work has been carried out at practically no cost to the State and has had an excellent effect - political and general. The fact that there is now a motor road •etween Muscat, Muttra and Bait al Falaj is of course of military importance with regard to the role of the Levies as a protection for the first two places. In other words road making up to date, in addition to other advantages, has assisted towards the original object of the Levies. lurther road making ( an excellent thing in itself) will presumably have to be considered from the same point of view, and if it does not directly conduce towards this object then the question will have to be considered as to whether it inter feres too much with military training. This is really a question • •t. -5- question for the Commandant to decide* Do you concur with the above general principles as regards road making by the Corps? Mi scella n eous . 9* I n his para 7 Captain Ealker makes various suggestions:- (a) and (b). I have dealt with these. (c). Captain Walker’s suggestions seem sound. }d) Indian officers will be dealt with in a separate . letter. (e) This would appear advisable if it can be arranged. (f) Forms subject of a separate letter. (g) This account should certainly not be attached to the Levy budget. (h) Provided the necessary minimum of military training be given, see para 8 above, formetion of corps into Pioneer unit would appear to be a good idea. (i) Increase in transport advisable provided funds could be found. FIHAKCS . 10. Captain Walker’s budget table explains itself. He suggests that there should be an annual expenditure for 5 years of He.154,000 to carry out the programme dealt with in hie para 7. I concur with his suggestion, but the Financial Adviser will have to be approached. The Levy Corps* 11. I should like to take this opportunity of express ing my opinion of the t?orpc. The men are cheerful, well turned out, smart in handling their arms and keen on regimental games and sports. The Cohl ender-in-Chief ,Ecist Indies who - as you . • •you are aware - visited ¥uscat recently was considerably impressed with them. That the Levy can work hard is proved by the road it has made. The present state of the Corps ia fact reflects great credit on Captain Walker and hie Indian officers, who have worked hard and continuously, ofter under very trying climatic conditions, to produce this admirable result. sd/ T.C.Fowle, Major, Political Agent &amp; H.JJ.M’s Consul, Muscatn C°py ot a ajemorandum No. 17^, cateo 16tin November 1930, irom the Commanclant, Muscat,Levy Corps, to the Political Agent, Muscat. Sub.jact. Future policy for the Muscat Levy Corps. Since taking over cornmana of the Muscat Levy in May 1928, it has been a matter of some difficulty to decide in which way the Levy could best pull its weight. There is at present no policy to guide one anc there appears to be no very definite idea for what purpose the Levy exists. 2. Since the Levy rme started in 1921 its strength has got graouiuLly smaller, the calls upon it for economy more frequent and pressing, until, at the present moment it has reached a stage beyond which it should not be allcv/ec to drift without a definitely outlined policy. 3. When the levy was formed its strength was 1 B.O., 6 I.Os. and some 240 rank and file. It was found to be beyond the State*s powers to maintain, ana its establishment was reduced to 200 in 1927 and about 18b in 1928 with only 3 Indian officeis. At present its strength is only 1 B.O., 3 I. Os. and 149 other ranks. 4. It would appear necessary to consider whether the Levy is &amp;£xhx oi any real use as (l) a fighting unit (2) a political weapon, or (3) of any other use to the State. After over two years with the Levy it seams to me that as (l) it is of little use at present owing to the calls made upon it which interfere with its training. If mace highly efficient and mobile it could tackle any smaller trouble likely to be met with in the Batineh. It would not attempt to control Sur kxx Y/ith its present strengtn. (2) As a political gesture its value is generally agreed *xkxk to, there being a British officer in command. (3) The Levy is capable7. 2 capaole of carrying out of such work as the making of roads or tracks, bridges, making irrigation channels if required. Lack of finance entirely cripples most of these activities. It is yet to be definitely dtcidec if these tnings are wanted. 5. Going on the principle that a road up the Batineh would enable more effective control over the main revenue producing part of the country, the Levy, on Major Murphy, the Political Agent’s suggestion, concen- -trated its energies on the construction of a rough road from Muscat to Sohar. This road at present reaches Boshar. After its completion it is thought that it I may be possible to link up Sur via Hajar and Suwaik. A reconnaissance will be carried out this cold weather. This work, of course, has had a very detrimental effect on the Levy’s always small efficiency as a lighting force. 6. One had to choose which course was more bene- -ficial to the State. The Levy was looked upon merely as a spending department. Its repay to this was to make the road from Muscat to Mattrah v, r ithout costing tine State a single pice and indeed at a big saving on the budget estimates, owing to rigorous economy ana the cutting out of a very necessary re-armament programme. Lack of any kind of mecnanical aids necessity -ated the road being of the crudest description. The Levy was 180 strong. With the present strength, nitti* owing to necessary duties only some 65 men are available for any kind of v/ork, and a few more for training. A reduction to 100 would perhaps save the State about 3s. 24,000 per annum, but there would be no work done and their use would not appear to justify taeir upkeep. The very lov/est economical strength has oeen reached.7* Below are given the more outstanding items requiring settlement with some details and suggestions* (A) Minimum strength. (B) Armament (C) quarters. (D)Indian Officers. 1 B.0.,3* I.Os.l clerk, i ^ed. attendant and 150 other ranks. At present old and worn out non charger loading rifles firing Mk VI ammunition.brought with Levy from seistan. Rearm with modern short rifles at rate of 20-30 annual ly. 2 Vickers to replace worn out Maxims and 3 Lewis guns to make total four i.e.one per platoon. The mens lines are in a ruinous condition and are dangerous as the roofs are heavy, made of mud and the rafters rotten. Replace present eight mud barracks by five stone ones, four capable of holding 50 men and one for artisans, armourer, carpenter,shoemaker, tailor,etc. 1.0s*quarters require extensive repairs. Sender non commissioned officers granted local rank. Great difficulty in obtaining and have to return in two to three years to qualify for promotion. State pays pension contribution • • •4 © t contribution at officers rates yet an officer wishing to stay on in the Levy Corps or needed as Subedar-Major must leave the army on a N.C.Os* pension. This brought up in 1922 by Captain MacCarthy and Col. Smith after his inspection but nothing appears to have been done. This subject is contained in a concrete case in a separate letter. (E) Courses of instruc tion at Military Schools. Owing to the isolation an occasional vacancy at the small Arms and Machine Gun School for I. Os and Senior R.C.Os is a necessity Matter might be taken up with A.H.Ci. (F) Conditions of appoint ment of Commandant. Obsolete. Forms subject of separate letter* (G) Upkeep of horses of Ruling family. At present shown as a •non- military 1 ' expenditure by the Levy. Should not be attached to or be liable to be confused with the Military budget or expenditure. (H) Future Role. Formed into a Fioneer unit. This would allow for a definite military training from September to end of November thence could be employed and trained in road and bridge making or any other work of a major kind required for the State's benefit. If armed as in (A) could give a good account of itself in times of trouble, would maintain prestige, esprit de corps and self respect. Deprecate5 descending to status of amsll Labour Corps. Would involve no extra expend! -ture as the corps has always been self contained. (I) Transport. ‘ At present one Morris Commercial 25 Cwt type. Add one 30 Cwt lorry of same make (approximate cost Muscat Rs.3,400). Necessary for supply when working over twenty miles from base. 4 horses for offi cers as at present and twelve camels for M&lt;,G, SoA.A, water etc. Camels owned by state could be used when required and for training. 8. I consider that all the above could be carried out at an annual expenditure of Rs.154,000 per annum for five years. The lines will not last a further four years, nor will the armament or ammunition. If not gradually replaced will necessitate a sudden heavy expenditure, Without this being done the Levy might be able to carry on until the crash comes on Rs,142,000. 9. The attached table of Budget estimates and expenditure will show the large retrenchments made, recently. Endeavours to carry out the smallest scheme of re armament have been waived in response to requests from the treasury. The time has come when any further cheeseparing or even the maintaining of the present low level of expendi ture constitutes a fals economy.TABLE OF BUDGET ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL EXPENDITURE OF THE MUSCAT LEVY FROM 1922 to 1930* Year Budget Estimate, Actual Expenditure* 1922 Rs, Rs* 262564 1923 - 169738 1924 • 168344 169000 1925 ■ 1646000 100000 See Note (a) 1926 •163250 171915 1927 ' 163250 167084 1928 • 167050 150847 1929 * 158980 139144 See Note (b) 1930 • 163200 Will be about Rs* 140000*.
