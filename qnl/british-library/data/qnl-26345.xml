SECRET. 4th August, 1937 Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 450 of to-day, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of the memorandum which His Majesty's Ambassador sent to the Prime Minister on July 23th, on the subject of civil aviation in Egypt viewed from the defence aspect, with particular reference to future collaboration between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork and the exclusion from Misr Airwork of foreign interests other than British. I have, etc., (Signed) J.C. STERNDALE BENNETT CHARGE D'AFFAIRES. The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc etc etcCivil aviation in Egypt presents an important defence problem with two aspects:* (a) the exclusion of activities which would enable potentially hostile foreign Powers to influence aviation development in Egypt and to build up for themselves a nucleus of pilots with a detailed knowledge of the country; and (b) the building up of a reserve, for use in the event of war, of Egyptian aircraft, pilots, mechanics and wireless telegraphy personnel. 2. These tv/o points are matters of common concern to the Egyptian Government and His Majesty f s Government in the United Kingdom, in view of the Treaty of Alliance, and point (b) is one which the Egyptian Government may think it well to direct the Military Mission to study with a view to the ultimate elaboration by the Higher Defence Council of a long-term policy. 3. As regards point (a), two things seem to call for urgent action. The first relates to the capital of Misr Airwork. This consists of ’‘A” shares which must constitute not less than 60 per cent of the total and must be held by Egyptians, and 'B' shares which may be held by foreigners. ,, 3' shares up to 40 per cent of the original capital issue were taken up by Airwork Limited, Heston, which had an option to take up a similar proportion of any additional capital issues. So far, however, although the total/V &amp; total capital has heen increased from £E.20,000 to ^E. 30,000, the holding of Airworlt Heston remains at £E3,0Q0, or only 10 per cent instead of the original 40 per cent. It seems important to ensure that the 'balance of the ,f B H shares, which may technically he held by foreigner’s, are not taken up by other foreign interests. If the Egyptian Government agree as to the urgency of obtaining some safeguard that this important example of Anglo-Egypt!an co-operation shall not lose its purely Anglo-Egyptian character, the matter is one in which their view would undoubtedly carry great weight with Talaat Pasha Harb. 4. The second urgent matter relates to the reservation to Misr Airwork of a short haul area with the object of justifying the Egyptian Government in refusing permission to foreign air lines to operate services to Egypt other than genuine transit services which would be kept to certain definite routes. His Majesty^ Government agree with the Egyptian Government in considering the reservation of such an area to Misr Airwork very desirable. It is probable, however, that any announcement of such reservation would immediately provoke demands for reciprocity from countries within the area contemplated, and, in view of the fact that Misr Airwork may not at the present time be in a position to operate services on a sufficient scale, the rejection of such demands might be difficult to justify. It may be preferable, therefore, to make no announcement until such time as Misr Airwork are in a position effectively to compete with foreign lines in the short/short haul area. In the meantime, any application from a foreign air line to operate a service terminating in ■^gypt could, no doubt, be held up pending a full examination of detailed proposals, 5. It has been suggested that it might be to the advantage of Misr Airwork in developing a short haul area if they could count upon the collaboration of Imperial Airways. It is understood that Imperial Airways are ready to co-operate in a general way with Misr Airv/ork, and His Majesty’s Government consider that, v/ith goodwill and frank discussion between the companies, an arrangement could be arrived at which would be of great mutual advantage, not only to the companies in practical operation, but also to the two Governments in eliminating competitive subsidy which would be out of harmony with the spirit of the Treaty of Alliance. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, it is for the two companies to work out the practical details of any agreement. It is understood that Tala,,.t Pasha Harb and certain officials of Misr Airwork will be visiting the United Kingdom next month and this visit might afford the best opportunity for a detailed discussion of the matter. 6 . It would, no doubt, be inadvisable for either His Majesty’s Government or the Egyptian Government to attempt to dictate to the companies concerned a policy which might be commercially unacceptable to them. The two Governments can only hope to persuade the companies of the importance of co-operation. It is suggested, therefore, that the Egyptian Government on their side vis-^-vis of Misr Airwork, and/and His Majesty’s Government vis-d-vis of Imperial Airways should each take whatever action may he possible to encourage direct discussions at an early date between the two companies, and that they should keep in touch with the course of such discussions in the hope that, under governmental auspices, a form of collaboration and renunciation of competition may finally be worked out to the mutual advantage of the companies and in the common interests of the two Governments.NO DISTRIBUTION, l&amp;ZXSBtem: Mr. Kelly (Alexandria) 14-th August, 1957.

Revised .lemor.anc.Lim was sent to Is aha s Pasha on July In short time available and in midst of accession ceremonials it was impossible for him to tackle TalvVA Haro before the latter left hgypt on July s9bh out I understand appropriate instructions are being sent to Ecnrptian Ambassador in London. Ot/ .1apparently Bean subscribing for 30# of £80,000 (the present cppltal) or £84, Ofx In all. i hether Airworlc should be invited to sell out their present holding of 8,000 shares to Imperial Airways wee a detail which Bight be considered later; but in any ceee it would seem essential that AirworJc should retain their management agreement with Mlsr, which means retaining :utz' personal assistance and seat on the Board. Now that tne limp ire Malls Agreement has been signed, it was thought that conditions were more favourable to such an approach to Imperial Airways; and It was also suggested that the Secretary of State might in alee some play with the fact that we have voluntarily consented to make good to them the £30,000 per annum In respect of landing fees at Portsmouth wnlch they had by an oversight omitted to provide for in their estimate of expenses under the agreement and to which accordingly they had not contractual claim. o. The possibility of bringing in another British operating company so as not to extend Imperial Airways’ monopoly was considered; but on the whole it was felt that the balance of argument was in favour of using Imperial Airways on these services, which are already aoclosely linked with their existing Ampire Trunk Routes. At the same time, it was agreed that there was real danger lest Imperial Airways should use their position both in Sgypt and Iraq to stifle tne growth of those national servicse in order to prevent competition with their own existing services. It was agreed that this would be disastrous and that if Imperial Airways were to be brought into the picture at all it must be after a very straight warning preferably from the Secretary of State personally that any tuen policy would not be tolerated by Hie Majesty’s Government and that they must play the game and/and subordinate their own interests to the national interests of tne two countries# 4. It was suggested that at the same time the Secretary ©y State might broach with Imperial Airways the question of their entering into an agreement with the Iraq Government to subscribe for 51# of the capital of a new Iraq national Aviation Company which that Government have in mind to form, with an estimated capital of £200,000, for the purpose of developing civil aviation in Iraq and the neighbouring countries. Since invitations to submit proposals for co-operating in the formation of this Company were sent by the Iraq Government to the German and other foreign governments as well as to ourselves, it certainly seems desirable that an effort should be made to secure British participation in this important development, 5. At the same time you made it clear that you had no reason to suppose that the Secretary of State had departed from the view which he put with great force last winter to the Foreign Secretary and to the Cabinet Committee, that he was not prepared to contemplate a subsidy from civil aviation votes in order to keep Germ an interests out of -gypt or any other country outside the Empire. It must not be supposed, therefore, that he would be prepared to offer any financial inducement to Imperial Airways to come into these two concerns, such as the Foreign Office letter of the 9th June suggests that we ought to be prepared to make. 6. I oreover, apart from this general objection to a subsidy for this purpose it does not seem tht’t there is any need at this stage to contemplate tne necessity for a British subsidy to enable either the Egyptian or Iraq concern to develop on a profitable basis. 7.A ' • lurnlni to details, it was agreed that you would Bug eet a re-draft of the beginning of paragraph 4 of LampBon’ e telegram number 3t&gt;6 referring to tne propoeed reserYation to aier of a short haul area. You pointed out tint, we could not clcia a new short haul service for Mlsr terminating in r foreign country, such ee Creece, without giviiig the tireeks the reciprocal right to run a correspondtng&lt; aervloe ending in dgypt. the principle of such reservation, therefore, must be confined to indicating to any country dw'. i’J.’ eady poseeseing landing rigiitB in agypt that traffic does not Boom sufficient to justify additional servicea at present and that the agyptiene could not agree to another service being added until they themselves are prepared to run their own service, fhis suggested that for the time- being the idea of an Kgypt-Greece service should be dropped. •loz only would it give the Greeks (which would probably mean the Germans under cover of a Greek service) the right to run a corresponding service into %yptj but it would seem that from Maxwell's confidential observations to the Embassy that Kier is not yet competent to embark on new services of this kind. It would be much better for them to learn to walk before they try to run and to devote their attentions for the time-being to improving their existing services with British co-operation and advice* 8 . In thie connexion we mentioned that there seemed to be some misunderstanding both at the Foreign Office and at the ifimbasey about Muntz 1 proposal for an Egypt-Italy service. There couid be no question of giving the Italians a reciprocal right to land in ifigypt since they already possessed that right; and you felt sure that when the negotiations for that right were taking place the iigyptiane stipulated/(3 stipulated on your advice that they should have the reciproca right to land in Italy at any future date if they wished to use it* indeed, it sight he that the reason why Muntz had made this particular proposal was that he wished to develop a new short haul service which would not give any new reciprocal right to ; oreigners 'beyond that they already possessed* 9. Finally you and I told Makins that it seemed to us that both the foreign Office and the Ambassador were iziclinea to mis-judge untz* Bo far as we could judge he was playing straight and v© had indeed been rather favourably impressed t ith the way in which he received the suggestion that Imperial Airway* might be brought into the picture. I presume that you will now put these proposals forward with a view to an approach being made to Imperial Airways on the lines indicated if higher authority approves. I'he foreign Office have again this morning reminded, me that in their view it is most urgent that we should be in a position to approach *!ah&amp;* es soon as possible while the conditions appear to be favourable. Yours etc., (Intlld.) A.P.W.£ took the opportunity of our visit to Southampton today to have a full talk with Sir George Beharrell about the •gyptian situation. I explained to him wnat the position was; tne importance of iaaintaixiing a strong British interest in Misr Alrwork, and the risk of German penetration through Horus or possibly even through hisr Airwork# i oaid that it appeared to me greatly in the intereets of Imper ial Airisays ti*at they should take an interest in Misr, Imperial Airway a conducted the trunk, route through Bgypt, and re hoped and expected that the hgyptiaa Govemment would co-operate in the air mall* It was clearly to the interest of Imperial Airways to ensure that Egyptian services worked in with their main services. Participation in the Egyptian national company would give them a first-hand knowledge of what was going on in ^gypt which they could gat in no other ay , ano would enable them to influence Egyptian civil air policy* Moreover, it seemed to me that participation in Mlsr, enc. thereby co-operation with the Egyptian Government, might give them both a knowledge of and an influence on conditions outside Egypt* /or example, it wrs certain that Greece would want to have a service to Egypt, and it was probable that Egypt woula went to have a service to Greece. It was important that such services, if they oame, should not conflict with Imperial Airways' services. Further, such co-operation with Egypt might afford another opportunity of putting pressure on Greece to give and maintain the necessary facilities for the Imperial cervices. I told 8ir George *uite frankly that Imperial Airways were suspect in Egypt, and that there was a fear, which I was sure was unfounded, that if they acquired an interest in Misr/Mier Air^ork they would use their influence to try and curtail or euppreea the Egyptian aervicee. Sir George Beharrell aaid that he thought it was very desirable that Imperial Airways should acquire an interest in Misr Airwork and co-operate with them. If they did so they would wish to be represented on the board, wnich is obviously right and reasonable. It would certainly not be their policy to suppress Egyptian services; their whole record showed that not only had they welcomed feeder services elsewhere to their great trunk routes, but had done a good deal to finance and support them. Sir George agreed that the most practical way of securing the co-operation of Imperial Airways would be for them to take up the 24,000 ah&amp;ree in the new capital. Vhether or not Imperial Airways should acquire the existing holding in Mlsr of Airwork Limited, was a matter which might well be left for consideration in the future. Sir George said that he would discuss the matter with his colleagues on these lines. He appreciated that the matter was urgent; and that if the opportunity was to be taken it must be taken quickly. I undertook that ae soon as I heard fro® oir George that Imperial Airways were definitely prepared to work on these lines, the Government would immediately communicate with tiir Miles Lampson and try to get such an arrangement accepted by the Egyptians.

My dear Mouueey, I send you herewith - (1) note of a talk which I had with Taher Pasha on the 24th June, (2) copy of a letter dated 29th June froa Muntz enclosing a letter froa Hanal Bloui Bey. Yours sincerely, (Signed) P.C. 3HELMERDINE. Sir George Mounsey, ft.G.M.Gr., G.B., Foreign Office, Downing Street, S.V.l.Viait of Taher Pas/ia to D.G.C.A HOT/, . H.B* Moixamed Yaner* Paena, Preeidant of the Aero Club of Egypt and Vice President of Mier Airwork, wee in London laet week as Egyptian Delegate to the P.A.I. Conference. I wsa introduced to him at a reception given to the Delegates by the Conservative Air Committee on tne Terrace of the House of Commona on Tuesday the 2&amp;nd June, and met him again on the following day. On Wednesday he aaked if he could come end see me at the office as he had several matters which he would like to discuss. I therefore arranged tnat we should come back to the office together after the luncheon given to the Delegatee by the Poyal Aero Club on Thursday the 84th June. I happened to sit next to him at this luncheon, in the course of which we had some general conversation end I found him most affable. 2. At tne office he began by asking whether he could speak to me quite openly and give me his views on the development of Civil Aviation in j gypt. I replied that I hoped he would be quite fradc as we were very much interested in the subject and anxious to help in every way possible. He referred to the suggestion wnich had been meae that Imperial Airways should ta&amp;e a financial interest in Mlsr Airwork. He thought that this suggestion had originally been out forward by Group Captain Hone. It dia not command itself to him and ha was aware tnat Talaat Herb Pasha, the President of Misr Airwork, was very much against it. Kightly or wrongly they had the idea that Imperial Airways would seek, in their own interests, to curb and limit the activities of Misr Airwork rather than to develop them. He/(3 u® mentioned tii&amp;t Airwork Ltd* (Keeton) noif only held a ten per cent Interest in the company and had forfeited their right to further participation. Although he was very Bauch against financial participation by Imperial Airways in Mier Airwork he would welcome any orked out plan for the closest co-operation between the two companies in their mutual interest. He thought that they might help one another in several ways, e.g. Mier Airwork might undertake a charter service on behalf of Imperial Airways; arrangements might be made for th® standardisation of fares and for the regulation of time-tables so that Misr Airwork’s service might act as feeders to Imperial Airways' trunk routes* Imperial Airways could help Misr Airwork with technical advice and might act as their agents for tne booking of passengers on the services which they operated* 4. Taher Paaha went on to refer to suggestions which had been made for Misr Airwork to operate a service to Lurope* !J ® thought that it was essential for the proper developmeht. of the company that some such service snould be started* A service to Kome had been proposed bat he was against this, as he thought that it would be too expensive and offered little prospect of commercial success* lie would much prefer a service to Athens as there was a considerable volume of traffic offering on this route Wi-icn could not be carried on the through services operated by Imperial Airways and the K*L.M* These companies naturally preferred to carry through passengers and it was impossible for persons wishing to travel by air between ijigypt and Athens to book passages in advance. They could only be taken et the last moment if accommodation was available* I pointed out that in the near future the frequency of Imperial Airways* services would be greatly increased* He was aware/aware 01 this but thought that adciitioael services, say two e week in eaoh direction, could be run with advantage between &amp;fcypt and Athens. A subsidy would of course he necessary* He pointed out lust Athens was a Junction for lines extending* to various parte of Hurope and he thought there would be a number of passengers wno would wish to continue their Journey by sir oeyond Athens. He realised that if Mier Airwork required facilities in Athens the Egyptian Oovernaaent would have to give facilities to a Greek company in Hgypt. In his view the Greeks would be unlikely to take advantage of such facilities. They had never yet been able to run an efficient air line. 5. Taher Pasha then went on to speak of Group Captain Bone, the Director-General of Civil Aviation in gypt. He said that he found him most difficult to deal with. He said thstt they had had their difficulties with Bone’s predecessor. Sir Quintin Brand. The latter was very slow but at any rate he was ; hard worker and did hie beat to advance the cause of Civil Aviation in Egypt. Bone was either obstructive or simply did nothing at all. Taher , asha mentioned that additional aerodromes were urgently required and existing ones needed improvement, wioney had been available last year but nothing wai done in spite of repeated requests. as .• r esident Of the ^\ero Club he had been trying to start gliding, for which a suitable site was available. He thought that gliding would increase air-mindednees and be a good training physically and morally for young Egyptians, who were needed for the Egyptian Air Force. Bone’s attitude was that he did not know whether gliding was of any real valOe and that In any case he had no time to go into the matter. InThhar Pasha’s vie* Bone never tried to urge hia Minister to get things done. As an Knglisn adviser he was in a strong position but preferred to do nothing. He was more of a diplomat tnan an aaministrator and if Taher Pfcsna wentto Bee Alai he generally suggested that they should talk matters over at dinner or attend a cabaret together* Taher Pasha compared him most unfavourably with Uing commander /.H. Tait wno until recently has been serving with the Egyptian Army Air jborce* The latter was always most helpful and was held in very high regard by all iigyptiane. Taher Patna said that they only wished that they had him as Director- general of' Civil viation* He instanced the very valuable help wnich Tait gave him in the organisation of the Egyptian Air Hally held early this year* He had taken this entirely on his own snoulders though it was not really his job and all competitors had expressed their complete satisfaction witn the arrangements which had been made both at main aerodromes and at landing grounds in the desert. The Egyptians very much regretted that Tf it would shortly “be leaving their country* 6. Taher Pasna tnen mentioned that Kamel Eloui Bey, managing Director of Misr Airwork, was shortly visiting America and would also go to Germany and Italy before returning to Egypt* he was afraid that he might come back with suggestions that Misr Airwork should purchase American aircraft* He knew that a British company had recently aad to purchase an American type. He himself would mucn prefer to use British machines* Up to date they had used nothing but De Havilland aircraft, which had given them satisfactory service but if they were to operate a service between Egypt and Athens they would have to have something better and he did not know of any British type which would be suitable* ?• I thanked Taher Pasha for speaking so frankly and told him that I hoped that some satisfactory means of co-operation between/between Imperial Airways and Miar Airwork could be worked out* I would do my best to bring this about* Ae regards the question of a service between iigypt and Athene 1 said that I thought there might be a possibility of Misr Airwork being able to charter machines from Imperial Airways* A joint service might even be considered* In saying this I had it in mind that Imperial Airways might shortly have one or two flying boats of the 'Kent'' class which could be made available*OOPY 4e) MH.

I think I cannot do better than send you t is letter just ai it is so that you may get the proper insight into Misr Airwork mentality. You will note tnat Talaat Herb Pasha is still in a very friendly mood tnat he ia all on trie look-out for political interference. Personally, I feel that the conversations proceeding between the Resident and the Egyptian Government are fraught with danger as far as Airwork - Misr Airwork relatione are concerned. I do not know quite wnat game Hafez Afifi Pasha is playing but personally X believe Misr Airwork, on purely commercial grounds, would be well adivsed to leave :£gypt-Rurope to the bevy of Continental subsidised companies wno are already operating through lines to South Africa and the Far Bast. I should be grateful if you could let me have this letter back in due course. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) Alan Muntz. Lt.

As you will see in the minutes of the board of directors I was authorised to go to the l•SKA., j&amp;iglend, Germany etc, to study modern methods of operation, new aircraft, cost©, traffic etc. Apart of the utility of being au courant with the latest practice it will helj me in having an idea of the best methods to operate an air service across the sea, I shall visit the main operators, and tne main aircraft factories and I shall compile a© much data as I can, | hope to be beck in agland towards the middle of August, intention is to stay in ^ngland for two or tnree weeks and the] to go to Germany, Prance and Italy on my way back to Egypt, Talaet Pasha will be leaving Egypt for Ihirope towards the end of July. He actually booked on the 29th steamer. He will stay a few days in Paris and will then proceed to England. I am not quite sure when he will be in England, but you must expect him in the second half of August, Before leaving Egypt he particularly emphasised that neither you or I should get involved in any discussions which would commit the Company in any way, I feel that he does not want us to talk for the Company without his knowledge or presence. %hen he arrives in England you can get in toucn with him ana he will then tell you what to do. I also feel that he will want to submit to the board any proposals that might be made to him. Consequently, I feel you must be very cautious indeed in the matter and if you haye any suggestion© to make they should on no account be put to others before you see the lasha. I am sure you realise all that, but as the Pasha talked to me about this again before I left, I felt that I had to tell you about it. As/As regards a service across the sea, I do not feel Inclined to tell you here jay views. It would he too long. A decision on such a auitter depends on so many factors, not the least important being subsidy, and I feel we should discuss it calmly at the right time. I shall be in a position on my return to talk with more knowledge of costs, method of operation etc. Taher will be in ngland for the F.A.I. Conference 21st - end of June and you are bound to see him. Hafez Afifi Pasha our Ambassador seems to know a lot about our projects. He talked of a possible service Kgypt- Kurope, by us. He did not seem to like the idea very much. He said it was unnecessary, and that it was premature. He also said that he thought it was too ouick a step to make, that we had to form Egyptian staff first etc. He then said that a service as far as Athens would be enough! 1 don't know what he really meant. I avoided talking 'uyself. Of course, you know my views about a service across the sea. Athens as a terminus is no good commercially. It means finishing nowhere. I am not for running a service just for the pleasure of it. Kven with a good connection in Athens, such s service will not serve its purpose and w ^21 not to my mind be successful. The number oi passengers going to Central Kurope is big and will justify a service. By Central Europe, I mean Italy, France, Switzerland, Australia, Germany, Belgium, Holland and ngland. A service finishing further than Athens will not cost much more, and as for the revenue side of it there cannot be any hesitation. At this stage I am not envisaging the political side of it at all, I am merely looking at the commercial aspect of/of the question. I will not definitely say whether iome, Cenoa, Milan, •enice or Vienna or even Marseilles would he the best terminus, but I feel that somewhere in the centre of Europe must the line terminate. The terminus must be central with good railway and air connections to the different important centres of urope. I quite appreciate the difficulties, financial political and technical, but I consider it would he disastrous to run a second rate service and to run a service to a place where there is no possibility of obtaining reasonable traffic. As regards the technical side, this can be easily overcome, if the problem is seriously studied. Of course, it will not be an easy matter to obtain the necessary financial assistance for such a scheme, as it will involve much bigger expend!tuie than the Government might expect, but with perseverance and proper handling of the question we should be able to succeed. There are so many things to say and discuss that I feel I better leave them till my return. I only mentioned generally ;uy points of view at present so that you would be somewhat conversant with them. I feel that you will agree generally to my ideas, the main being rather not run a service at all than run a bad one or one that has no chance of being successful. Let us take our time and plenty of time and do things properly. Before I left I got the Minister to promise to get our training scheme for professional personnel for Miar Airwork through. This will allow us to go ahead with training Egyptians as wireless, pilots and G.E.s for our ork without/mam without undue financial sacrifice* It aust he our main object if we want general support. I feel it ay duty to supply the country with an adequate number of highly efficient and trained people. Regarding Bone X have had one or two rather painful interviews with him. He is going on leave to England shortly for a couple of months. I don’t know whether he will meet you and have the same sort of discussions with you as he had with me, but try to avoid them if you con# hat sort of thing leads to nowhere end is indeed tiresome. He says he might not stay and that he is coming back to Rgypt only for a very few months and then leave the job. He seems to say that you and I are the reason for it, as we don’t like him etc. etc. He gives me the Impression that if we liked him to stay he would, but he suddenly would shout out an unpleasantness which would upset one terribly. It is a long story. I better leave it until I see you. Things are going on as usual in Mier Airwork, returns are not bad. Regularity is good, and steady progress is being made in every direction, kaxweli is very useful, and everybody is happy. The Pasha has been very nice lately. He has indeed been so nice that it is a pleasure and a delight to work. He has not been well and I hope he does not work too much when he goes to Europe. I hope you enjoyed your trip to America and that Margaret liked the country. I hope she is completely lit now. Pie* se give her my kindest regards. &gt;id she get the sheet? Were they O.K.? Looking forward to seeing you, Yours ever, (Signed) Kamal. P.S./f &gt; F.3 # After months of argument and all sorts of discussions and opposition specially from Kuitor, I got the minister to agree that aerodrome consultants must he consulted on the layout for Almasa* Maxwell was with me when the Minister said he would obtain expert advice. Bone has been forced into it by us. 3o I think Borman &amp; Dawbarn will be called.

You will have seen fro» Lajapeon’s telegram No* 391 of the 2nd July, sent to you on the 5th under Foreign Office reference W 12772/128/27, that the Ambassador was anxious to discuss this question with the Egyptian Government early in the present week. In view of this telegram and of the disastrous results which, as I am sure you will agree, may result even from the briefest further delay in sending Cairo the necessary instructions, we are extremely surprised by Sir George Beharrell’s proposal to defer consideration of the subject until the next meeting of the Board of Imperial Airways on the 20th July. I should therefore be most grateful if you would explain the position to Imperial Airways, informing them of the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to the immediate attainment of a decision in this question, and asking them whether in the circumstances they would not wish to consider the subject at a special meeting of the Board held at the earliest moment possible* Yours sincerely, (Signed) GKORGtS MGUN3BY.

My impression that in spite of the excellent lead given in foreign Office letter of June 7th to Air Ministry enclosed in your despatch No.646 the question has somehow got on the wrong Hues. My telegrams Mos. 555 and 556 were joint recommendacions Dasea on unanimous view of General Officer Commonoung, ^ir Ofxicer Commanding, Head of Military MissionjDirector General of Civil aviation and myself that development of Egyptian Civil Aviation through collaboration between Imperial airways and iviisr Air worx was primarily a defence problem and a vital one. This ^ low we have reason to believe is shared by Nahas and I had hoped to be able to inform His ■xcellency that it had been adopted oy His Majesty’s Government. It is disappointing thereiore to fma that the question appears to have been dealt with mainly from the point of view of Civil Aviation and elimination of competition between the two air lines. There is no indico.tion in your despatch under reference that defence aspect nas be^n considered, 2. If defence basis is accepted importance of excluding foreign i. e. non-British Interest is evident and uwo thingD become important.(44v o CJ.

(To) Reservation of a short-haul area for misr Air work ano. its development in association with imperial Airways. This idea appears to have been summarily dismissed because of possibility of a country like Greece asking for reciprocal facilities. I submit however that it deseives further consideration, we know that it attracts Egyptian Government and I should have thought that it should be capable of adaptation so as to over come suggested difficulty. 5. In principle I am all in favour of discussions oei-v/oen Imperial Airways and Talaat Harb partners when the latter vIsj-os Angland in August provide* that both clearly understand that the matter is primarily governmental and not commercial. I see no re ison for earlier discussions between the two companies, what is urgent however is that I should be authorised to speak go bahas on general lines suggested in my telegram No.556 before Talaat Harb leaves Egypt (on July 29th) so that the latter may be fully aware of Egyptian Government^ view. 4. in previous correspondence I have urged that we snould concentrate on working out some form of pr actical collaboration between Imperial Airways and ilisr Air work designed not merely to eliminate compedition between them but to develop activities of kisr Air work in common interest of defence; and that in view of Talaat Harb’s known susceptibilities question of solid financial participation by Imperial Airways in kisr Air work should be left aside at least until a later stage. It is disturbing to find therefore from enclosures to your despatch that Imperial Airways appear to be approaching the problem mainly from the point of view of their own interest in eliminating competitionJ o« competition and that they are putting financial participation in the fore—front. 5. If discussions are to succeed I am convinced mat it will he necessary for Imperial Airways to take a much oroadcx line and for His Majesty’s Government to maintain close and constant touch with discussions in order to guide them along the right line. 6. In short I feel that the matter has slipped hack on to a commercial plane. I would urge once more tnao io^is essentially governmental, owing to its political and military importance and to the fact that both companies are heavily subsidized. I earnestly trust therefore that veiy early instructions may still he sent to enable me to take m up with Hahas on that basis.— COPT (J 3166/54/16) No.811 - imsigAi^ TOKiSION Ojr'lPlCE, S.f.l, 14th July, 1937. Sir, In ay telegram Ho.278 of the 12th June I stated that it was not desirable that Your Excellency should discuss with ilahas Pasha the proposal that Imperial Airways should collaborate with Misr Airwork until Imperial Airways had osen consulted. I now transmit to you herewith copies of semi-official correspondence between my department, the iressury and the Air Ministry showing the conclusions reached as a result of discussions waich have taken place between the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways. In the light of recent developments, as recorded in the enclosed correspondence, I consider that the best course for you to pursue, if you see no objection, will be to confine any conversations which you may think it desirable to have with Nahas Pasha in the immediate future to a general assurance of tne interest of Imperial Airways in the prospect of collaborating wicn Misr urworks. In view of the suspicions of Kamel Eloui aey, you should make it clear to Nanas Pasha that His Majesty's Government have no desire to force any fora of partnership between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork or the latter against tueir will. f'ter intimating that Imperial Airways .are believed to be ready to co-operate in a general way with Miar Airwork, and that His Majesty's Government would see great advantage in suen an arrangement if it could be brought about by goodwill on both sides you should indicate that in the opinion of His Majesty’s/ Hie Kxcelleney Sir Miles Lampeon, GeG.M.u., c.B., etc. f etc*, etc *, Cairo*Majesty 'b Goverament the two oompanies should be left to work out any agreement in detail, and you should suggest tnat as the officials of Misr Airwork will be visiting this country next month, their presence here would afford the best opportunity xor negotiating a definite agreement. 3. I request tnat you will inform me whether you agree in the proposed line of action, or whether there is any particular reason for greater urgency in the matter. I realise that your anxiety to discuss the question with Nahas i asha at an early date is due to your desire to ensure that the Egyptian Government shall not enter into any negotiations vith erman air companies before the proposed Mlsr Airwork- laperial Airways arrangement is concluded, rou will observe from the enclosure to this despatch that Talaat Harb Pasha eau rfohammeu latter Pasha are both at present opposed to financial participation by Imperial Airways in Misr Airwork, and that Imperial Airways feel that the best chance of removing Misr Airwork's suspicions would be for the representatives of the two companies to discuss the question fully when Talaat Herb Paehe visits this country. 4. Ii for any reason you do not agree in the propoaed course or action you should telegraph your observations urgently. If, on the other hand, you are in agreement with it you are authorised to speak to Sahas Pasha in the sense indicated whenever a suitable opportunity occurs. u, ©..Hi y © t(5e (Por the Secretary of Stetej (tigd) Ronald Campbell#- -iO^/isa/sr '■ y.u.tv .

I had opportunity during the week-end at Alexandria to prepare the ground through Amin (whom I found fuRy in agreement with our l? thesis]) and on June 6th we took matter up on general lines with Minister of Finance during the course oi a long conversation at which Amin was present. 2. Makraia at once agreed that question of civil aviation (short-haul) must he regarded as a matter of national defence and consequently of joint interest to Egypt and ourselves. Ke at once agreed (1) that the question should he handled on that basis; (2) that B. shares in Misr [? should not he] ineligible to pass into other than British or Egyptian hands; (3) that this question should properly oe treated in the first instance as between the Governments; (4) that question of link-up between Misr and Imperial Airways was a matter of detail to be gone into later. 3. Amin said (and Makram agreed) that as Misr was a Government-subsidised company Minister of Finance could pretty well tell them what to do. I remarked that as Imperial Airways were also Government-subsidised I imagined that His majesty s Government had means of making their wishes known ana felt. 4. Though 1 saw i.ahas in Alexandria on June 5th there was i ? ’’no 1 ’ omtd] time to broach the matter with him but as ground has been well prepared both through Amin and Makram I propose when I see him on June 14th to take up the matter on the lines of my telegram No, 356 unless I hear in the meantime co theW 10902/128/27 WMXIVX 0FFI0S, 3 . .1 plate 9th June, 1937 Sir X mm directed by ur* Secretary Kden to refer to the letter from this department W 10429/128/27 of the 7th June regarding Egyptian Civil Aviation services and to transmit to you herewith copies of three telegrams on this subject which he has receive! from His Majesty’s Ambassador in Cairo, 2. It will be observed that the views of Sir iviles Lampson substantially coincide with the opinions expressed in the Foreign Office letter under reference, but that Sir ^iles Lampson lays particular stress on the defence aspect of the problem and on the importance of obtaining an early assurance from the Egyptian Government that financial participation in civil aviation companies shall be reserved for Egyptian and British interests, 3ir iiles Lampson accordingly proposes to leave a memorandum with the Egyptian Prime Minister the text of which is contained in Cairo telegram No, 356, 3.

Yon' telegram No. 251. Position has no n been discussed net only with Director-General of Civil Aviation but with the General Officer Coiimianding, ihe a:.:' Officer Commanding and the head of military mission. he are a -.1 agreed that development of civil aviation in Egypt (including facilities for foreign air lines) is primarily a defence problem and a vital one. Air Officer Commanding considers it important both to exclude foreign interests from Egyptian aviation and to restrict as far as possible the operation of foreign lines in what would be in the event of war a vital centre of communications for the British Empire. He thinds it dangerous to allow such lines to operate outside well-defined routes of transit-flight and especially to allow them to build up a nucleus of pilots with detailed knowledge of the country. He also points out that in war the Bitish Company's forces might have to be to some extent self-contained from the point of view of supplies and training of personnel and that any assistance in this respect which Egypt could offer might be most useful in view of possible desirability of minimum interference with Imperial Airways* mail services. 2. We all view with concern decline in British holding in Nisr Air Work and danger of other foreign interests taking up outstanding n B M shares which may be neld by foreigners (see memorandum enclosed in Mr. Sterndale Bonnet's letter to i.re Campbell of May 29). We consider that some safeguard against this is perhaps some2. perhaps of greater immediate importance than a link-up between M'i. 3 r Air Work and Imperial Airways and that first essential is to induce the Egyptian Government to ensure that no foreign financial interest other than British is introduced into Misr. 5. That done, it still seems to us necessary to urge upon the Egyptian Government the advantages of a link-up in order to facilitate effective development of a short-haul traffic area reserved to Misr Air Work which would alone justify Egyptian Government in refusing foreign applications for other services to Egypt, If link-up is to be brought about we fe^l that tne best course would be direct discussions in Cairo between Misr Air Work and Imperial Airways under governmental auspices ana after the ground has been prepared on both sides by the governments. The position of Air Work Heston and Mr. Muntz’ influence with Egyptian personalities concerned are factors which cannot of course be ignored and His Majesty’s Government will no doubt think it desirable in the first instance to take steps to ensure their co-operation in what is now proposed as being in the national interest. 4. As regards action in Egypt I suggest as a first step that I should take up the matter with Nahas Pasha on broad general lines of common interest of the two governments in this problem from the point of view of defence and in spirit of Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. My immediately following telegram contains the text of a memorandum which I would propose to leave v/ith His Excellency as soon as 1 hear that general line recommended above has the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 5. I beg that matter may be treated as urgent.NO distribotion. &amp; bir i- Lampson (Cairo), 4th June, li'5' 7 . D. 7.37 a.ia. 5th June, 1957. R. 9.30 a.ra. 5th June, 1937. No. 556. My immediately preceding teleoraia. Following is text referred to in paragraph 4. Civil aviation in Egypt appears to present an important defence problem with two aspects. (A) The exclusion of activities which would enable potential hostile foreign Powers to influence aviation development in Egypt and to build up for th^selves a nucleus of pilots with a detailed knowledge oi the country and (B) the building up of a reserve for use in the e/ent of of Egyptian aircraft pilots, mechanics and wireless telegraph personnel. 2. These two points are matters of cormnon concern to Egyptian Government and His Majesty s Government in view treaty of alliance and point B is one which Egyptian Government may think it well to direct the military mission to study with a view to ultimate elaboration by the Egyptian Defence Council of a long term policy. 5. As regards A two things seem to call for urgent action. The first relates to the capital of Misr Airwork. This consists of 'A' shares which must constitute not less than 60C of the total and must he held by Egyptians and 'B' shares which may be held by foreigners. B shares up to 40? of the original capital issue1 2* issue v/ere taken up by Airwork Lihited, Heston, which had an option to take up a similar proportion of any additional capital issues. So far however although the total capital has been increased from ,220,000 to 280,000 of [? grp. omtd. ] the holding of Airwork Heston remains at £3,000 or only 102 of the original 40/v. It seems important to ensure that the balance of the B shares which may technically be held by foreigners are not taken up by other foreign interests. If Bgyptian Government agree as to urgency of obtaining some safeguard that this important example oi Anglo-Hgyptian co-operation shall not lose its purely Anglo-Egyptian character the matter is one in which their view would undoubtedly carry great [? grp. orntdo] with Talaat Pasha Harb. 4. The second urgent matter in view of German pressure is reservation to Misr Airwork of a short haul area which alone would justify Egyptian C-overnment in refusing permission to foreign air lines to operate services to Egypt other than genuine transit services which would be kept to certain definite routes. His Excellency the Prime Minister has already accepted the principle involving short haul area and of some form of collaboration between Imperial Airways and Misr Airv/ork which would permit of its speedy development with the advice and assistance of Imperial Airways in return for which Misr Airwork would operate its local services within the area in close conjunction with long distance Imperial Airways lines. Unfortunately the private discussions which have been proceeding lor some time between Talaat Pasha Harb and Mr. Muntz and between Mr. Muntz and Imperial Airways have so far led to no result5c result c^nd it seeii.s desirable that a matter of such importance 'ko b^yotian Goverriment and to His iviajesty's Gfovernment concoming companies which they respectively subsidize should no longer be left to private discussion but should be dealt with lirst on a governmental basis and then direct between subsidized cornnanies concerned under governmental auspices. ° ^ IiG j-irst essential seems to be to assure Talaat tasna Harb that there is no foundation for any suspicions which he may entertain that Imperial Airways desire to secure control of or a dominating position in llisr Airwork. It is clear how- uV -r that theie aie other ways in which the tw ? o companies could collaborate in a practical manner to their mutual advantage and Oxi the other hand it is desirable to eliminate the possibility oi competition between them more especially as such competition W'oulci in el feet be competition between the two Governments who subsidize cue companies and thus entirely out of harmony with the spirit of the Treaty of Alliance. o e It is suggested that Egyptian Government on their side vis-a-vis misr Airwork and His Majesty's Government vis-a-vis ol imperial Airways should eacn take action at once with a view to bringing about direct negotiations at an early date bet\ een cne two companies preferably in Cairo and under governmental auspices with a view to working out a form ol collaboration and renunciation oi competition which would be to the mutual advantage of the companies and in common interest of the two Governments,\r Copy. (w 10429/128/27) ffifcEDIATE . 3760 FOREIGN OFFICE, 7th Jur.e, 1937. V f6i Sir, I am directed by hr. Secretary Eden to refer to the letter from this Deoartment No. 7 9293/128/27 of May 14th enclosing a telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador in Cairo on the subject of Egyptian civil aviation services, and to inform you that Mr. Eden shares the concern and apprehension of Sir Miles Lamnson in regard to the delays and difficulties which have occurred in the negotiations for the organisation, with British participation, of commercial aviation in Egypt. 2. Mr. Eden is awaiting a further report from Sir Miles Lampson on the result of his discussions of the recent developments with the Director of .Egyptian Civil Aviation, but he considers that certain Preliminary deductions may be drawn from the information now in his possession. 3. In the first place Mr. Eden regards it as of paramount importance on political grounds that civil air- services operating in and from Egypt under the Egyptian flag should be under Anglo-Sgyotian control, and tUt the attainment of this objective should be taken as the guiding principle in determining the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in any negotiations which may in the future be undertaken. 4. From this point of view I am to state that if these negotiations are conducted on the same lines as hitherto the prospects of success are in Mr. Eden’s opinion negligible. On/ The Secretary of the Air Ministry.On trie information at his disposal, Mr. &lt;]den is not impressed by the part which has been played by Mr. Alan Muntz, and he is in general agreement with the estimate formed by Sir Miles Lamoson of Mr. Muntz’ attitude. Thile it is natural that Mr. Muntz should be exclusively concerned with his own interests, it appears unlikely that, even on this basis, he will bring matters to a conclusion, or that alternatively his projects, if realised, would promote the interests of His Majesty’s Government. While Mr. Muntz has a claim to participate in future negotiations as representing a holding of a lOj share in Misr Air Work, I am to suggest that he should as far as possible be eliminated as a principal in these negotiations. 5. In all the circumstances I am, accord i.ngly, to propose that His Majesty's Government should henceforward take a direct and active part in promoting a working arrangement between Misr Air ,/ork and Imperial Airways for the purpose, firstly, of organising Egyptian local air services on a satisfactory basis and of reserving for the operation of these services the short-haul traffic area including Palestine and Iraq; and, secondly, of establishing a service under the Egyptian flag from Cairo to Gurope. The terminus of such a service seems to be a matter for discussion, but the proposal made by Mr. Muntz for a Cairo- Home service would, in Mr Aden’s opinion, be unacceptable on political grounds. 6 . In order to induce Imperial Airways to participate actively in working out arrangements of the nature proposed, it appears necessary to contemplate the possibility of making a financial grant to them in an appropriate form, by way ofr' a subsidy or otherwise, to compensate them for the additional liabilities which they would assume. I am to suggest that His Majesty’s Government should in orinciole decide in favour of making such a grant in the event of a satisfactory scheme being evolved. G. I am accordingly to pronose, for the Air Council’s consideration, that Imperial Airways should be approached on the aoove lines, and that the first opportunity should be taken of working out, under the auspices of His Majesty's Government, proposals for effective Anglo-Egyptian co-ooeration in matters effecting civil aviation in Hgyot. In putting forward these proposals Mr. Hden is influenced by the consideration that the future of civil aviation in -dgypt must be regarded from the political as well as the commercial aspect. In the interests of maintaining the predominance of British influence in Ggyot it is in the highest degree desirable that the field of air communication should not be left for exploitation to a weak Egyptian company or for Penetration by foreign Governments. In particular Mr. Bden would view with concern the establishment of a pooling arrangement between an Egyptian and any foreign company, or an infraction of the principle tnat trie short-haul area should be reserved for Egyptian or Anglo-Egyntian services. The reservation of this area will give an advantage in dealing in tne future with all Powers whose air communications pass through ^.'yot and will enable His Miajesty’s Government to view with less concern the eventual establishment of purely transit services operated by foreign Powers. In conclusion I am to observe that in order to ensure the success of the negotiations on the lines proposed/'V —3 proposed it will 'be necessary to give the greatest possible consideration to the amour nroore of the Egyptian Government. 8 . I am to request that the observations of the Air Council on the contents of this letter may be furnished at an early date. 9.

Gerald Dalany askad recently to see me about the affaire of Kiar Alrwork and came this morning, accompanied by I r. Maxwell, the Britiah adviser to Klar Almost. They were a little worried in the flrat place by a auggeetlon which *r. ^unt* has made to the Air ^inietry aince hie return to l.ondon. It will be remembered that# aa reported to the Foreign Office in paragraph 2 of our telegram fco. 212 of April 2nd (41/24/37)» Hr* funt* when he left here was considering the possibility of the operation of an Athena - Alexandria - Lydda - Bagdad aerviee by Hiar AirworK witli a special contribution from Aimork Limited in the shape of “Albatross* machines supplied by B.M.0. It appears thst Mr. fetunts has suggeeted that H.M.G. should place one ^Albatross’ machine at the disposal of Airwork Limited which the latter should pass on to tfisr Airwork# thus bringing up Airworfc’s capital contribution to somewhere near the 40 required# but that this machine should be ueed# not for s service Athens# Alexandria and beyond, but for a service between ,ome and Cairo. Mr. Pelany and Mr. Maxwell did not agree with the idea of a Borne service and had so informed : r. unts. it would lead to the Italians demanding reciprocal facilities and getting a further foothold here. 8 . The second point made in the conversation was that the Minister of Communication* had asked Misr Airwork to put up detailed proposals for a Cairo - thens service to be operate t&gt;y the company. The«e propo.al. could partly he considered by the Board of the company and Mr. Oeleny end Mr. kax.eU understood that at the meeting of the hoard It «as the intention of Sternal Kloul hay to aufge.t that a Cairo-Some service would be more In the intere.t of fgypt and lisely to lead to more tourist traffic. neither Mr. Selanynor Hr* could understand why Kernel HI out was pushing this Home Idea and they could not help feeling that there was some connexion between It and the suggestion Hr* Hunts is making in London* 3. the third point, which Hr. * a*wall said he wanted to &amp;ftke, concerned the efficiency of ilsr Alrwork itself. He said that he was very worried by the growing inefficiency and ao was the chief engineer. He confirmed that the difficulty over the subsidy was entirely due at the outset to the failure of Hisr Airwork to carry out the provisions in their authorisation by submitting at the proper time and In proper form figures on which the subsidy could be based. But it was not with the accounting side of tne business that he was now concerned. The management was unsatisfactory. The staff was increasingly Inefficient, and there was a growing absence of discipline. Neither Mr. Lelany nor Mr. Kaxwell said anything against kernel kloul but they implied that the situation was becoming too much for him owing to the habit of Egyptian mergers of the staff of complaining over hie head either to Talaat Pasha Herb or to the Minister of Communications. Hr. Maxwell 1 a conclusion was that Hisr in its present state was frankly not competent to run a trans-Mediterranean service with the necessary degree of efficiency or, indeed, of ety. Mr. Maxwell said that, had some form of financial amalgamation between Imperial Airways and Mlar Airwork taken place as was first suggested, he thought that the present rot would have been stopped as Imperial Airways would have been ought into the running of the company more and would ve been able to see that the necessary standard of fety, etc., was kept up. He realised thatthat for } r «ner«l re««on 8 this ids* of rsjslgsmstion mu f t now he railed out t hut in hie view the oroner solution now was to aim at the establishment of a new Ajtglo~Kgyr&gt;tiaa concern to run the Athena - Igjrot service with a ooaaihle extension later acroea Kurooe. This idea was the one that ’^r. /unit had mentioned to me on ^arch 80th ' aee our telegram 3 vr&lt;^ No. ^U_to Foreign Office in 41/S4/S7) and which he had particularly wished to be kept confidential in the hone that it would be out forward eventually aa an &amp;gy-&gt;tian suggestion. I found that &gt;. elany ^nd Mr* Maxwell were aware of Mr. Vunta* intentions on this oointt but their imoreaeion waa that Taher Paaha wae now unlikely to out it forward. Mr. Maxwell enlarged the Idea aa a possible variant of that of reserving a short-haul traffic area for Mier. lhat he would like to see ie a new Anglo-Kgy^tian company formed for running the Athene-Egyot aerviee (in effect an amalgamation between Imperial irways and Flap for thia ourooae) which the Egyptian Government would protect from competition by an undertaking not to grant an author!Ration to any other line to carry osfmengera, fralght, etc., on that section except in transit. The British Government on ita part would do it a best to ensure similar protection for the Miar servicea to Palestine and Bagdad. I am not sure that the latter part of thia programme la feasible, owing to our mandatory obligations In Palestine, but I do not think we need go Into that at the present stage. 4. I said that I did not quite know where I stood as between Mr. v unts on the one hand and Mr. Deleny and Mr. Maxwell on the other. I did not wish by reporting what Mr Maxwell had said, to compromise hi a relations with Mr. Funta or to cause confusion by giving the impression that the British /interestsInterest® in ^isr Alr^ork wer* *&gt;n«*«king two voices. ^r. said, however, that he hsd explained his views to ^r.

Germg.n penetration into the Near and Ear East. The Committee considered a note (I.A.C.330) prepared by the Air Ministry and Foreign Office on this question in accordance with the decision of the Committee at the 42nd Meeting. The Committee also took note of a despatch (l.A.C.336) from His Majesty’s representative at Kabul on this subject. The Committee recommended that this paper should be submitted to the Secretary of State for Air with the suggestion that it should be put before the Cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence, and in due course transmitted to the Dominions, India and the Colonies concerned. The Committee felt that in submitting the memorandum to the Secretary of State it would be outside their terms of reference to do more than draw attention to the facts w r hich had been brought to their notice in the course of their investigation into Civil Aviation affairs, and that it would be for the Cabinet or the Committee of Imperial Defence to suggest what, if any, action should be taken to meet the danger of German penetration.XKT£R-DEPARTMENTAL COMMIT?SK OK INTERNATIONAL AIR COMMUNICA TIONSo Geman Pt-n ^ tfatlon in Ci^ji Aviation in the 'Near and Far East 0 The attached mem'nandura on the above subject; prepared by the Air Ministry and Foreign Office in accordance with the deeie.ion of the Committee at its 42nd meetings is circulated for 1 nto rma 11on.

AM AJAUAAA* (M emorandxun by the Air Min istry an d Forexpj i 0t rice) I, Ever since tbs advent of the Nazi Regime in Germany j there has been evidence of increased German activity abroad in the many fields which offer favourable opportunities for the expansion of German inflienee and commerce, and during the last two years these activities have been intensified in the field of civil aviation no leas than in other fields* If these activities in South East Europe and in the Near and Fax* East are viewed not in isolation as mere attempts at local penetration* but as the cG~Qrdina«ted development of a single policy, then their definite purpose becomes readily apparent, and that ie the vigorous revival of the ?, Drang Nach Osten' in the aix\, The progress which Germany Is making in Greece, Egypt, Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan and China is briefly indicated below. The German efforts in each of these countries should be regarded as part of one whole plan* II, GREECE . In pursuance of her policy of expansion Germany managed to obtain a concession from Greece for Deutsche l»uft Hans a to extend their service from Sofia to Salonica in 1932* Go-operation was next established with the Greek company which had obtained the concession (Icaros) for the development of air lines in Greece, and this afforded the German company the opportunity to improve their foothold, which the international situation has subsequently enabled them to consolidate.. Last November, taking advantage of the changes in the Greek Government, the Germans were able to negotiate favourable Governmental and inter—company agreementslAnder which the Deutsche Luft Hansa a in addition to their service to Salonica 9 hare secured rights to operate to Athens and Rhodes from the direction of Sofia and also from that of Venice* In virtue of the inter-company agreement the Deutsche Luft Hansa and the Greek Air Line now represent each other reciprocally in Germany and Greeceo Moreover the German Company undertakes to put its chief technical expert at Deceleia at the disposal of the Greek Air Line free of charge* The service to Athens was inaugu rated in January of this year and the agreements referred to above have secured for Germany the necessary transit rights for services further afield, But this is not the whole extent of German penetration 0 A school for training Greek civil pilots for the Greek air lines has “been established by the Germans at Salcniea and Greek pilots also receive training on the German axi* lines operating between Germany and Greece* German aircraft are being sold to Greece at attractive prices* German money and propaganda, and above all Germany’s state- controlled economic policy have established a strangle-hold over Greece which is likely to close down still further on British interests in the field of civil aviation. There can be little doubt that the attractions offered by Germany are partly responsible for the difficulties which impede our present negotiations for a new Air Convention with Greece. The harm which this German penetration can do to British interests may well pass beyond the commercial sphere and assume a strategical aspect* Germany obtaining aerodrome and repair facilities in Greek territory which might some day enable her to threaten our Mediterranean communications* III* EGYPT* As Turkey has firmly closed her doors* Egypt is the next goal for a German route to the East., German influence was brought to bear upon Taher Pasha* Vice- Chairman of Misr Airwork* the Anglo-=Egyptian concessionaire■■rapcompany subsidised by the Egyptian Government© lu 1936 proposals were made for the formation* under Taher Pasha's chairmanship* of a German-Egyptian company styled 'HORUS' , to be financed and subsidised by Germany* for a service between Athens and Egypt in the first instances The fact that the Vice-Chairman of the Egyptian National Company should be associated with Uue enterprise is an indication of the extent of German intrigue© As the result of the vigorous opposition which we were able to prompt in Ministerial quarters in Egypt* combined with the Egyptian Government's lack of enthusiasm for the project* th«^ application for Horus to establish this service was rejected© fl Defeated in this line of approach, the Germans in December last • i formally applied for temporary permission to operate a service between Berlin and Cairo, via Athens and Rhodes 'which would I facilitate intellectual and commercial relations between Germany and Egypt', end 'would eventually extend beyond the Egyptian Frontiers'© Permission to make experimental flights before the end of 1936 was requested^ Various pretexts have been advanced for holding off this application, but it seems likely that the Egyptian Government will feel bound in the long run to accord facilities* least for transit services, especially as the Germans have offered to forego passenger traffic in Egypt© In the meantime* the recent 'Oasis' race has afforded the Germans an opportunity of impressing local opinion, and with this in view a large passenger aircraft flown by two picked German military pilot© was sent, with a number of other modern aircraft, to participate© The aircraft* having completed its task in Egypt, has proceeded to Iraq and will, from there, cont5,nue its demonstration In Iran and Afghanistan.

It is known that Germany, through the Luft Hans a. Company, has schemes, however nebulous they may be at present, for the extension of civil air routes operating via Bagdad through Pvr&amp;ts. to the Far East, and Iraqi reeictions to such tentative proposals as have been advanced through the medium of the German Conoul in Bagdad have not been entirely unfavourable* As far as is known, however, no proposals in respect of this projected service have yet been made offici&amp;Xlyo The risk exists that if Iraq cannot obtain from His Majesty 9 © Government a satisfactory offer of modern military aircraft for the expansion of her air force she may turn to the German© who are very anxious to step in* It this risk materialises the Germans would be in a favourable position fco ask for preferential treatment for their civil aviation, or to* enter the local market tor civil aircraft* e-g. as the essential foreign element in any 'national” Iraqi Company a v r IgAH- In February X9g?* the Junkers Persian Air Transportation Company, a German enterprise controlling most of the commercial aviation in Iran, commenced working internal services from Teheran to Baku* Bushire, Bagdad and Meshedo But the venture closed down in March 1932 fi mainly owing to the financial collapse of the parent Junkers company in Germanyo Actually the Luft Hansa took over tile Junkers organisation, and may have made odd flights, hut all regular services ceased from the date the Junkers Company liquidated its contract with the Iranian Government* During the recent visit to Teheran of Dr* Bchacht- however, the re-inauguration of civil air routes in Iran under German operation is understood to have 'been discussed* The tentative proposals provided for (a) a through line from Berlin to Kabul via Bagdad and Teheran*, with Kermanshah and Ramadan as emergency landing grounds and two other emergency landing grounds between Teheran and Meshed, (b) subsidiary feeder lines within Iran to be operated by Junker aircraft* (g) all ground organisation to be in the hands of German operatives* The latest information available suggests that whilst the Iranians might agree to (a) and to the presence of a limited number of German ja^chanice at the aerodromes, (b) and (c) would be refused. These negotiations may be affected by the agreement for the establishment of a service between Teheran and Bagdad which is understood to have-been reached recently by the Iranian Government with the Iraqi Government, VI. AFGHANISTAN . Geman penetration in civil aviation in Afghanistan has not(&amp; Q as yev aciiieved tangible results t , but. there is considerable evidence to show that the German authorities are taking seriously their plan to run an air service to Kabul and* if possible,, beyond there to Sinkj ang, Gnina and possibly Japan 0 (The Japanese have also shown interest in the scheme.) The route beyond Afghanistan would not appear to offer many commercial advantages and for some time to come the operational difficulties would appear to be very considerable,. Moreover p Soviet influence y which is very strong in Sinkiang f is likely to be an obstacle,, But in the coux'se of a 'visit Kabul in July 1936 a German Junker O^seater aex'GpJ.ane made a reconnaissance up to the Chinese frontier* An attempt was made to cross the Pamir p but the aircraft was unable to gain sufficient height* Soon after this two Germans established a meteorological station on the top of a pass in northern Afghanistan at which observations were taken throughout the winter* It is evident p however, that the Germans would like to start a service to Kabul even if they could not go beyond* The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul on February 3rd that the German Charge d rj Affaires had informed him that the German Government had decided to establish a through 3ervice from Berlin to the Far East and asked the permission of the Aighan Government ,uo fly across their territory.. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had replied that the Afghan Government would « consider this request when they knew that the German Government had agreed with the Iraqi and Persian Governments for passage across their territories* It was subsequently learnt that the Bagdad agents of the Lux t Hansa thought that the Afghan Government had already given permission for the line to cross Afghan territory* The Afghan Government are being informed of this* Moreover p the German representative at Cairo informed the Egyptian Goveramen&gt; on March STth that the eastern terminus of their proposed line for which they wanted facilities in Egypt was 'Kabul to begin with'.The German machine mentioned in paragraph 5 of Section III (Egypt) has also flown to Kabul f but it is not known whether the officers in charge of it carried the negotiations any further^ A German ex-officer pilot is at present in Kabul engaged on renovating two old Afghan Junker aeroplanes* It was thought that he was intended to create the nucleus of an Afghan eiril aviation service, but the Afghan Prime Minister has told Colonel Fraser-Tytler that this is not strictly true, though it was proposed to employ such aircraft as the Afghan Government possess on civil duties. The Commander of the Afghan Air Force is about to leave this country for Berlin. vno china. Working from the other end of the chain, Germany has secured a foothold in China, but her attempts to push westwards have hitherto been unsuccessful* In 1931 the Sino-German Company ’'Eurasia” was formed for the development of internal air services in China, and for the opening up of a route through Manchuria and Siberia to Europe 0 Russia was obdurate, however, and this latter part of the scheme proved abortive* The Germans, therefore, instituted informal inquiries with regard to the possibility of Eurasia extending their Shanghai- Yunnanfu service to Rangoon or Calcutta, We agreed with the Government of India that this extension could not be permitted, and that if an air connection with Europe was desired by the Sino- German Company* it should be made at Hong Kong by means of Imperial Airways Limited 9 s service* It seems likely that an application by Eurasia to fly to Hong Kong will, in fact, shortly be received. In February last, however, the Manager of the Company made it clear to our Air Attache in Shanghai that the main objective of German civil aviation policy in the East is still a direct service/ V 7 between Berlin and Shanghai* and it is evident that they are bending all their efforts in that direction. VIII, From the commercial standpoint this penetration by Germany in the Near and Far East can only be viewed with disquieto In the attainment of her objective * money seerns to be no obstacle; pioneering flights are undertaken and services started without regard to expense^ The local organisations which are created at the places of call of German air lines serve as focal points for the spread of German influenoe which is also fostered by the undoubted high standard of the services invariably provided, and by the efficiency of the material and personnel employed The route in prospect traverses fertile fields for the growth of this influence.. If Germany gains control of civil aviation in the minor States along this route, her methods will make it hard to displace her. Trade also follows the flag* The fact that British influence runs counter to her purpose goes some way to explain the present deterioration of our relations with Germany in civil aviation in Europe and her desire to extort concessions for every facility accorded to us.. It account® for Germany's recent desire to extend the Anglo- German Air Navigation Convention to include British overseas territories, a request to which no official answer was returned, although it was unofficially intimated that it did not meet with our approval c It also accounts for her representations that the absence of colonies cramps her developments in civil aviationc The strategic aspect, is not here directly in question,, but the prospect of a German air line being firmly established as a conductor rail supplying motive force for centres of German 'Kultur' along one of the main lines of our Empire communications cannot be regarded with less misgiving from that standpoint than from the commercial angle, 22nd April, 1937,6T y &lt;211 jo.

Mr. Dulany and Mr. Maxwell understand that Mr. Muntz has made co Egyptian government suggestion similar to that referred co in paragraph 2 not however in relation to Athens - Alexandria - Bagdad Line but to a Rome — Cairo service. Egyptian Manager of Misr Air Work is credited with intention of advocating that service at next conjoint meeting in preference to Athens Cairo oervice for which Minister of Communications has asked the Company to work out proposals. 2. Mr. Dulany and Mr. Maxwell have informed Mr. Muntz that chey disagree with idea of Rome service on the ground that it would lead Italians to demand reciprocal facilities and increase their foothold here. I entirely agree and hope that no encouragement will be given to it. 3. Mr. Maxwell's view which he has expressed to Mr. Muntz is that Misr in its present organisation is not by itself competent to run a trans-Mediterranean service with the necessary degree of efficiency or safety and he favours the idea ol establishing a new Anglo-Egyptian (i.e. Imperial Airways - Misr) concern on lines contemplated in paragraph 1 of my telegram under reference, run the Egypt Athens service with possible extension later across Europe, the local services to Palestine and Bagdad remaining in the hands of Misr alone.

I am far from happy about leaving the question of British holding in Misr Air Work in what I have already pointed out is a precarious position. I am also most uneasy at the way in which discussions raised by Mr. Muntz and Imperial Airways referred to in your telegram No. 210 are hanging fire. I understand that Mr. Muntz has now left for the United otates and will not be back until June. 2. Meanwhile Germans are showing their usual persistency and German Minister is in direct touch with Talaat Harb. Director General of civil aviation has little doubt that he is negotiating for a ’’pool 51 between Luft Hansa and Misr for short haul traffic (see my telegram No. 256). 3. I cannot help feeling that Mr, Muntz may be playing for his own hand rather than for a link up between Imperial Airways and Misr designed to preserve British and keep out foreign influence in civil aviation here. 4 0 The time seems to have come therefore to lift these negotiations on to a broader plane. From conversations which I have had with Minister of Communications I know he professes to be convinced that question is really not one of civil aviation but of defence and that Germans and other foreigners must be kept out. The point is on what pretext; and the only\ (9 2 . only sound pretext is the reservation of short haul traific to Misr which can only be brought about effectively by collaboration with a company of the standing and experience of the Imperial airways, 5. I would urge that His Majesty's Government on their side should take more active interest in the whole question from the defence stand point. After all we are dealing not with ordinary connercial enterprises but with; Government subsidised companies on both sides, I do not think therefore that matters should be left to be dealt with on purely commercial basis between Mr. Muntz and Imperial Airways particularly a^ Mr. Muntz is unable or unwilling to complete .British holding in Misr. I suggest that immediate consideration be given to possibility of direct discussions in Cairo between irnperiax Airways and board of Misr Air work ( i.e. Talaat barb)and more closely than hitherto under the aegis of His Majesty's Government and Egyptian Government. 6o Director Genera.! of civil aviation considers that Talaat Karbs original opposition to f inan c i al participation of Imperial Airways in Misr arose from the lact that this idea was sprung upon him in a way which made [gp* omtd] suspect that Imperial Airways were endeavouring to get control of Misr, Director General of civil aviation thinks that if main points of practical collaboration were first decided and Talaao Vveie thereby convinced of the advantage and of the fact that the^o_ is no desire on the part of Imperial Airways to swallow up Misr it might be possible to discuss with him even f.jrancjMr amalgamation, . _ , . , 0 7. Meanwhile Group Captain bone ^draws^attention ^o point which you have no doubr clearly in mind namely tnao it would be advisable that Colonial Office shouia.not ior th. . present grant any long term mail contract to Misr_Air sotk between Egypt s Palestine and Cyprus since protection from Imperial airways competition on this service constiuUtss one of - 'the main advantages obtainable by Misr Air work from proposed link up.'1 I Wj .DI ST;^-U TlC j.'J o • Sir S .

Minister of Communications told me on April 6th that he had had frank talk with Talaat Harb on the lines that Misr was bound sooner or later to be frozen out if they did not get in with some big organization; that all these civil air lines had potential military value and that Sgypt must for this reason also keep in with Great Britain. The net result is according to Nokrashy that Talaat Harb is willing to work with Imperial Airways though not to be financed by them. On that point Nokrashy agreed with him and I said that I also perfectly understood the fear that Misr might be swamped if Imperial airways finance was admitted. Nokrashy finished by saying that he was anxious to get ahead quickly in view of foreign complications, 2. The important thing now seems to be that practical as opposed to financial collaboration between Imperial Airways and Misr should be worked out quickly. Director General of Civil aviation has suggested that it might take form of:~ A. An arrangement regarding Misr Cyprus service under which Imperial Airways would agree not to put on a competitive service. B.

I understand present position as regards Ivdsr Air Work to be as follows: (1) Question of 1935 subsidy has been settled by decision of the Council of Ministers on April 1st which amounted to approval of payment of £,E.7,000 (approximate) outstanding. This does not affect present budget as budget provision was made last year though payment awaited Cabinet approval of basis of calculation. (2) Present draft budget contains provision for £.0.40,000 in respect of 1956 subsidy. Amin Osman has however assured a member of my staff that £&lt;.2,84,000 will be paid at the end of the present half year difference being met out of savings eventually regularised by supplementary estimate. (5) Misr Air Work thought it tactically unwise to press for inclusion in present budget of £.2.84,000 due for 1957. 2. When Mr. Muntz was here I received impression as a result of his talks with Taliat Harb Pasha he now felt there was no practical danger in Misr Air Work true so long as of Air Work being squeezed cut if their holding remained 10% as at present. While this may be Mr. Muntz’s personal influence with the board of Misr Air Work remains strong, it would clearly be preferable that British holding should be if possible on less precarious and potentially weak basis and only real safe course appears to be^ to take up full 40^6.

Mr. Muntz is anxious to state that the idea should he regarded at present as solely for secret information of His Majesty's Government. He considers it essential for success that it should ostensibly Airways have so far made no progress owing to fact that Taloat Pasha Harb while apparently ready to consider some form of collaboration with Imperial Airways is deeply suspicious of tion of Imperial Airways in Misr Air work is now working on alternative idea viz. that Misr should remain as constituted (i.e. with 10 per cent holding of .dr lork Limited); that its oudan, Mgypt-Halfa and ultimately Cyprus and that a new Anglo- he1 12 2 . ^ be Egyptian suggestion put forward by e.g. Taber Pasha to whom alone he has so far broached it and who seemed attracted. 2.

Your telegram No. 153 [of March 15th: financial position of Misr Airwork). I fully realise importance (1) of providing British share of additional capital required and (2) of preserving national character of Company. My immediately following telegram deals with need of clarifying financial position of Misr with a view to facilitating the raising of necessary British capital. Negotiations with Imperial Airways are continuing, and matter was considered hy their Board last week, and deferred pending further information to he obtained hy Muntz as to financial position of Misr Airwork and their relation with Egyptian Government. But you snould realise that introduction of Imperial Airways into picture is not in itself essential to the policy of His Majesty’s Government. If British Airwork could even now raise the necessary funds and he willing to take up their share of new capital in Misr that solution would he satisfactory. Notwithstanding statements made oy him in December Muntz has not wholly abandoned hope of this being done, either wholly or in ijart, hut much depends on price which British Airwork obtain from Air Ministry for sale of Heston aerodrome. This is now under negotiation, out- terms cannot he finally settled until April or later. Meanwhile you should he careful in any conversation with Egyptians to avoid giving impression that introduction of Imperial Airways is settled policy. This might prove very embarrassing to Muntz, since it . 0 •2 . it is not known how far ns has yet 'broached this suggestion to ^ his Board. ion should tane very early opportunity to see Muntz ano. oiscuss position frankly with him. Air Ministry believe him trustworthy ana he already knows their views generally. I do not understand the reference in your paragraph 3 to possioility of England—Cairo service. So far as we know this never seen iants’ s intention. I agree with you that the right policy is to concentrate on reservation of ’’short-haul' traffic for Egyptian Company. There are of course many diffi culties to be overcome, e.g. Egyptian Government must undertake to pay adequate subsidy (though judging by reactions of Minister of Communications as reported in your ho. 120 of 19th February, this should not be insuperable), and consent of Greek Government where necessary must be obtained, so that considerable time must elapse before new services in Eastern Mediterranean could be begun. Muntz might be advised by you to explore possibility with Director General of Civil Aviation. Meanwhile I look forward to hearing that the Egyptian Government have followed up suggesuioi.o contained in your aide-memoire of March 3rd with regard co ’snort haul'' traffic and the ultimate destination of German air lines passing through Egypt if the Germans only seek landing rights for long-distance traffic. If a favourable occasion presents itself you should adduce in favour of the exclusion of German lines from the area of ’’short haul” traffic the additional argument that the volume of traffic appears insufficient to justify a second service# I attach great import ance to these points as until it is known where the Germans are ncS - decision can oe reached as to how to view the proposed ^ g ? pt a ? a st ?PP in g place fc&gt;r through traffic only.

[Financial position of Misr Airwork]. whether additional capital is to be provided by Imperial Airways or by British Airwork, it is very desirable that the financial position of iviisr should be clarified with a view co attracting British investors. Position as revealed in the company's account for 1938 and estimates for results for 1937 is far from attractive* It would help matters if it were possible to assure British investors that the Egyptian Government were prepared to carry out their obligations fully and promptly in the payment of subsidy to Misr. The subsidy agreement with the Egyptian Government is not known to contain any provision of payment of subsidy by any particular time, and in consequence the payments due have fallen greatly into arrears. According to different methods of calculating the company’s entitlement, the Egyptian Government should provide in next year's budget for payment of (a) £140,000 or (b) £154,000. But the Ministry of Finance are understood to have declared it to be out of the question, in view of the special charges imposed on them by the Treaty, to provide for two years subsidy liabilities in 1937. Accordingly utmost that could be expected would be payment2. it is rumoured that the Ministry have actuary cut down the provision in their sketch estimates to £40,000 and it is presumably possible that even this orovisionsl figure may be cut down still further in the final estimates. In any case the company have no written authority from the Government on which to claim credit in their accounts for 1S56 for arrears of subsidy up to that date and are obliged to show in their balance sheet a debit of £60,000 due entirely to the delay in payment of the subsidy. ,/e should be on stronger ground therefore if we could satisfy British investors that we had received some or all of the following assurances from the Egyptian Government and you should, at your discretion endeavour to obtain them; (1) that provision would be made in the 1957 financial year for payment of arrears of subsidy up to 51st December 1956 on basis (a) at least £66,060; (2) that a written undertaking was on its v/ay from the Ministry of Finance to the Company stating that payment of this amount would be made to the company as soon as the necessary financial procedure had been completed and indicating by what date that might be expected; (5) that from 1958 onwards payment of subsidy will be made at regular (quarterly or monthly) intervals during the year of account; that assuming that it is hopeless to ask for payment of the 1957 subsidy until 1958 owing to the special difficulties of the Ministry of Finance during 1957, nevertheless payment of the _ 1957 subsidy will be made in full at the beginning of the financial year 1958 and thereafter no further arrears will be allowed to accumulate.COPY (W 5166/128/27) No. fc,/7(41/15/57) BRITISH : CAIRO. 6th March, 1937 Sir, With reference to my telegram Ho , 136 of y esterday, I have the honour to transmit to you the accompanying copy of the aide mtooire which I handed to the Prime Minister on 3rd March regarding the suggested linM-up between Imperial Airways and Mler Air work, and the principles by which the Egyptian Government might meanwhile be guided in considering applications for air facilities from other foreign airlines. 2.

The Right Honourable Anthony .der , i? .C * » H. p ♦ * etc. # etc.» etc.{ .&gt; o. alDE MEMOIR: 1937 Impressed by the possible effect upon the development of Misr Airwork’s ^xt rnal airlines of the increased frequency of the Empire Air Line schema, Uokraahi iasha, when in England for the signature of the Treaty, urged upon the Secretary of State for Air the importance of allocating certain air traffic in the Eastern Mediterranean to Misr Airvork* 2* Since then, application has been made to the Egyptian Government by the German Legation for permission to operate a service of the Luft-Hanea Company from Berlin to Cairo with eventual extensions beyond Egypt, and the K.L.M. Company have applied for permission to operate two additional services each week from Amsterdam to Egypt. The question of the German Governatnt^ application was discussed with the Prime Minister by the Ambassador on 2nd February, and the former agreed that the proposal should be held up. 3. A suggestion has now been made that, in order to assist in the development of Mier Airwork^ external services, there should be some form of link-up between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork thereby all Egyptian ’♦short haul 1 * traffic should be reserved to the latter, who would act as the feeder of Imperial Airways on such local services. This proposal has been examined by His Britannic Majesty's Government who are favourably inclined towards it. 4. Such a link-up would have considerable advantages for Misr Airwork. Besides safeguarding them from competition, e.g./^ 4&gt; O. 20 77 I e.g. as regards Palestine and Cyprus, It might rewilt i&amp; ^ considerable increase in freight and passengers carried by the Misr Airwork Bagdad line, as well as in general book g facilities, particularly between Basra, Damascus, Cyprus ana Egypt. 6. Time is, however, naturally required to study the suggested link-up, and meanwhile the question arises as to how the applications for air facilities from the foreign air lines referred to above are to be dealt with. Could not the Egyptian Government in dealing with sueih applications be guided by two principles: (a) freedom of transit to all genuinely through traffic with (b) reservation of all Egyptian 'short haul? traffic to Mlsr Airwork, i.e. that foreign lines should not carry passengers on the sections of their lines which could be regarded as 'short haul' traffic, such, for example, as those radiating from Egypt to Greece, Italy, Rhodes. Damascus, Palestine, Bagdad and, at a later stage, Aden and Abys , 6. Vith regard to the recent application of the German Government, to which an early reply is understood to be necessary, it is suggested that before a decision is fener it might be desirable to obtain f rom the German Government satisfactory replies on the following points: (a) whether the proposed service is a transit service. (b) in that dase, what is its destination: (c) Whether they would be prepared to forego short haul' traffic in the area indicated above, and (a; whether they would be prepared to principle to grant reciprocal facilities in Germany for Egyptian transit services 2nd March» 1937./ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]. i 3 Sir i...

I understand tb-t reply on general lines suggested (without precise definition of short haul area) was sent by Egyptian Government to German Minister on ..arch 6th and a reply on similar lines is about to be sent to the Dutch Minister. Both German and Dutch Governments till certainly return to the charge in the near future and as further postponement will be increasingly difficult it is urgently necessary to agree on terms of proposed link up between the Impelis1 Airways and kisr Airwork. 2. Fiwin car point of view if such a link up is possible there seems ho purpose in provision by British airways of capital required (Western Department's letter of February 11th). On the other hand unless British holding in Misr Airwork can be completed up to forty per cent of total capital (which will probably be increased to £120,000) there is danger of Banque Misr exercising option under existing [grp; omtd.] to lay out British holding. It seems essential therefore that when i.r. Muntz arrives here (I understand he is due on March 22nd) the latter have necessary financial backing and at least heads of an agreement between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork. 3. From conversations with misr representatives here it seems that Mr. Muntz in discussing proposed link up is likely to concentrate rather on provision of Imperial Airways - Misr service between)24- 2 . „et»een Kn g l»4 ^ Cairo than on aafognardlng ot shor a traffic to Misr acting as feeler to ferial Mr.ags' iong l stance services.

As regards transit traffic, I said that provided satisfactory replies could be obtained e.g. from the Germans, this was quite legitimate, name r ns cor expressed general agreement and said he had spoken on similar lines to the German Minister on March 2nd* Question of traffic between Athens and Egypt having come up, Prime Minister had made it clear to the German Minister that this was precisely the soit of thing Egypt would want to reserve for herself, not to the exclusion of through traffic but from local traffic angle. 2. I handed the Prime minister an aide-memoire suggesting that during the time necessary to study the suggested link-up between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork, applications from foreign air lines should be dealt with on^two principles (a) fre^aom of transit for genuine through traffic, (b) rese^ation o Mi ^ Airwork of lines which could be regarded as short ^nau±t:u^ Tt ‘ r1 ' for example as those radiating from Egypt to Giee-e, i-nc --m, ■ ■ y&gt; Damascus, Palestine, Bagdad, and at a later stage ^ ^ Abyssinia.

On point (a) it will be desirable to define precisely what traffic falls within the expression 'short haul traffic' so as to prevent competition from the jeimans with -Pier for traxii^ on services which the latter are operating or have in prospect, e.g. the Palestine, Bagdad and Athens services. As the Germans have offered to forego passenger traffic the '‘short haul 1 ' point could he met by limiting facilities to upscale technique” at points of call in Jgypt. This is a course which the French have adopted with certain of Imperial Airways ' services. ,vith regard to (b) firstly the destination of the services which the Germans desire to operate in transit through Agypt should be clearly stated by them. Secondly transit rights should be made conditional on uhe grant in principle of reciprocal facilities in Germany for Egyptian services. You should suggest to the Minister of Communications the desirability of obtaining satisfactory replies on the above points before the Egyptian Government agree to the new German application.(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] 1 J* ' / ti From i 1327 ^r.

On the occasion of Cabinet dinner at the hmhassy last night Minister of Communications earnestly urged his dnfi- culty in continuing refusal of G-erman application. Not only was there the precedent of K.L.M. through service hut even during the crisis of last autumn permission for through service via Kgypt had heen given to Italian Ala Littoria. He was at a loss to justify refusal to Germany. 2. I said that my own view was that all local Egyptian traffic should he reserved for Anglo-ngyptian Misr. He did not want German or any other intrusions in the Lgyptian field. His Excellency at once agreed. But that was not the answer to German application for through service: German Minister had now gone so far as to offer that no passengers should he carried though Minister of Communications thought that could not he seriously meant. 5. I said that I personally believed that right solution was: (a) reservation of all Egyptian 'short haul' traffic to Misr; coupled with some arrangement with Imperial Airways whereby Misr would serve as their feeder.

Director General ol Civil-Aviation had an interview with Nokrashi February 14th at which latter enquired what the position was in regard to German application. Director General of Civil Aviation replied certain political considera tions were involved which he was still studying. Nokrashi said that he did not see how application could be resisted without creating difficulties between Germany and Egypt, He said German Minister was pressing him for a reply even if it was a refusal as it would enable them to vary their route to Kabul accordingly* Nokrashi strongly urged Director General of Civil Aviation to expedite his final recommendation.

The subject matter is Britain's policy towards the development of civil aviation in Egypt; British policy being to restrict the influence of non Anglo-Egyptian companies and governments, with developments in Italian and German aviation being of particular concern. A policy given particular attention is a suggestion for closer collaboration between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork, with a view to reserving local short-haul traffic for the latter firm. A couple of memoranda prepared on the topic by Group Captain Reginald John Bone, Director-General of Civil Aviation under the Egyptian Government, can be found on folios 91-93 and 136-139.A note outlining an informal meeting between Sir Francis Claude Shelmerdine of the Air Ministry and Mohamed Taher Pasha, Vice-President of Misr Airwork, at the House of Commons in July 1937 can be found between folios 23-27. Also included in the file is a letter from Kamal Eloui Bey, Managing Director of Misr Airwork, to Frederick Alan Irving Muntz dated 19 June 1937: see folios 29-33. A letter from George Beharrell, Chairman of Imperial Airways, addressed to the Foreign Office and dated 1 July 1937, can be found on folio 35.The correspondence included in the file has been periodically forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in order to keep the India Office updated on developments; none of the correspondence in the file is directly addressed to the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
