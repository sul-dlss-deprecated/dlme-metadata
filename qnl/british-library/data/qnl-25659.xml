(RECD. 25th, 3 p.m.) '■v™.. 9 •* i 919 {JHy a? mm $9 941 - My immediately preceding telegram, I venture to take ?opportunity to en^phasise in the interests of future peace of provinces formerly under Turkish rule, the importance of ejecting Ottoman government from Constantinople. No step could emphasise more sharply the fact that the Turks are a beaten race and that their defeat implies that they no longer hold sword of Islam nor can pose as spokesmen of Islamic op: ini cm. Those chins are bound up with the possession of Constantinople which has given Turks a status in Europe control over a very important waterway. The expulsion of Ottoman Government from Constantinople will not only produce a great moral effect but will offer practical obstacle to (group ^ ^ undecypherable) of Turkish influence on the old lines. , Constantinople has been for sixteen hundred years the capital of a great empire: it id essentially fitted for thax position. Its palaces, government offices, religious and educational bail: ~ ings, to say mothing of its amenities as a place of residence, and the fact that it is a large city with immense housing accomodation with pleasant summer resorts close at hand, would A give to Turks if they retain it a framework of Empire which would to some extent continue to be filled. I- vkag are obliged to to remove the seat of government the framework must 9 be re-created and this will not come to pass quickly. In the past many Arab families from Mesopotamia dr Syria have migrated to Constantinople for private or official reasons and habitually resided there. They inter-married with Turks, their children are brought up as (?Turks) and a network of relationships are thus established. But an educated Bagdadi who has found in Constantinople a pleasant alternative to his native place will notnot view Brusa or Konia in the same light. The new capital will be nothing more than a small provincial town offering no immediate accomodation and no advantage over the towns of Syria and Mesopotamia. Ifcxs Of still greater importance is the fact \ that well-to-do families of the Arab provinces have been accustomed to send their sons to be educated at Constantinople. This custom may continue even with those who are not specially well-disposed to Turks. Without doubt the reactionaries would make a point of using educational advantages of Constantinople and would receive active support of pan-Islamic party and the religious authorities there in doing so. If Constantinople ceases to be the Turkish capital the matter will be on a very different footing. Removed from Constantinople present religious and political organisations will lose much of their prestige. It will be long before they can provide themselves with a suitable theatre for their activities and it is €a?e to say none will invest them with such traditional glory. It may be that the political importance of King of Hejaa, and of Amir of Afghanistan will be inconveniently enhanced but this is a minor evil compared to maintenance of Turkish authority in the ceded provinces. G-.O.C. in Chief concurs. Addressed Secretary of State and repeated Foreign.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. ^ i u SECRET . • ^30^ 0 The Future of Constantinople. x I have read Lord CuiWs Memorandum on this subject and would offer a few observations. (1) 1 think that. Indian Mohammedan opinion is entitled to greater consideration Jhe very tact that the misfortunes of Turkey during the war have been borne by them without excitement is only a testimony of their loyalty to the British Throne and .does not mean m tiro least that there has not been a conflict between their tempolal and spnitual allegiance which lias placed upon them a severe strain. They aie entitled to Recognition of then demeanour under this strain, and it would surelv be an act of mg latitude and of cynicism to say to them i 41 Because you were so loyal, because } ou did not show more excitement, because you have helped us in our ^ war, because you have actually ' provided soldiers to “ fight against the Turkish arms, we are going now to expel your fellow Mohammedans fiom Luiope. I would argue directly in the opposite direction. 1 would say that in making peace with Turkey we have got to teach the lurk that lie is beaten, we have got to deal with him firmly, we have not got to allow him to regard himself as in any way triumphant, and it was for that reason that I have always been anxious to sever his connection with Mesopotamia and Arabia, and that 1 am so anxious that lie should be compelled to obey completely the terms imposed upon him in the armistice concluded with him. But we are not turning the Austrians or the Germans out of their capital. I do not see why we should for these purposes turn the Turk out of his capital. It is not that the Indian Mohammedan has sanctity or reverence for Constantinople; it is that we ought not to deal this blow to a Muslim Power when we have achieved victory over it with the assistance of Muslim arms, and I would remind the Cabinet that the Prime Minister himself said : “ We are not fighting to deprive Turkey of its capital,” and again, “ Great .Britain did not challenge the maintenance of Turkey, or of the “ Turks in the homeland of the Turkish race with its capital of Constantinople.” 1 would add that notwithstanding the self-restraint of our Muslim fellow-subjects during the war, notwithstanding the active participation of Muslim troops in many theatres, it has been impossible to include a Muslim representative of India in partici pation in the Councils of the Empire. This point‘has been constantly brought to my notice in many communications from India, and now that we are dealing with something of such great interest to Islam, it would seem to me to behove us to consider Islamic interests all the more because the Muslims are not directly represented in our Councils. 2. 1 would next point out that if we are to turn the Turk out of Constantinople despite these arguments, let us be sure that we have some satisfactory alternative. Lord Curzon has stated so fairly the arguments for and against any solution of this difficult question that 1 would venture to say that we had better leave the Turk there simply because we can find no satisfactory alternative. I do not mean by this that I do not regard it as vital that the navigation of the Straits, including the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora and the Bosphorus, should in future be open in peace and war to the ships of all nations, nor do I mean that the Turks should he left any of the territory that they now occupy in Europe. But I would point out that Lord Curzon argues that America is unlikely to accept the charge. He shows clearly the objections to any other great Power and to a small neutral State, and he has to fall hack upon an international Commission, hut he suggests that it is impossible to conceive of this with the Turks still in Constantinople. I agree with Lord Curzon that if the remedy which he suggests were adopted, it would probably entail the return of San Sophia to Christianity. Now to my mind it is not a question of history ; it is a question of the actual condition of affairs, and it seems to me inevitable that to interfere with the Mosque of San Sophia or any other mosque must he regarded as a deliberate anti-Muslim act. 1 am perfectly certain that whatever might be thought of turning the Turk out of Constantinople, this action would he very much resented in India, and I therefore ask whether it is worth while to remove the Turk from Constantinople to embark on new anti-Muslim action which will he resented by those who have stood by us loyally in India, however patiently they may bear it, in order to adopt any of the solutions which have been suggested by Lord Curzon and others who have written on the subject. 8th January 1919. 10 SS 31 45 1/19 e. s. m;[This Doctjffient is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] 4 Printed for the War Cabinet. January 1919. C ONFIDENTIAL. P.-85. THE FUTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. 56 Memorandum by Lord Curzon. THE Eastern Committee having discussed at some length the future of Constantinople, Mr. Balfour asked me to place on record the arguments that had been used for or against the various solutions. . . r i Upon one point all were agreed, viz., that the Straits should be internationalised, that there should be a free passage for all merchant ships and men-of-war through the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus ; that the forts which command ail or any of these waters should be either dismantled or razed to the ground and that under whatever control Constantinople were left or placed, guarantees should be provided that the above conditions were not either evaded or infringed Similar strategic considerations would probably demand the prohibition either o a unne beneath or of bridges over the Straits. The following larger questions then emerged: (I.) Whether the Turk should or should not be allowed to remain as a governing * Power in Europe. , , -p (II.) Whether, in the event of his being expelled, any, and if so what, Cower should be invited to take his place; or ^ _ , (III.) Whether an international body, or Commission, should be set at Constantinople to supervise the execution of the suggested _ conditions, and if so, whether this would be compatible with the retention m any lorm of the Turk, or whether it would necessitate his expulsion. I. It was pointed out that the expulsion of the Turk from Constantinople was one of the avowed objects of the war. Great Britain and France agreed m l 915 to hand it over—together with the Straits and a considerable stnp^ of land on bo European and Asiatic shores-to Russia, as the prize o victory m tp conflict At a later date, in the Statement of the War Aims of the A1 hes, promulgated m reply to President Wilson in January 1917, the ejection ot the Turk from Europe was explicitly included, la^ ^ President Wilson pointed to a similar conclusion. Neither the Turk nor anyone else could therefore have any ground for surprise if the rea were now carried out. It has been made known both to him and to the entire The arguments that were used in favour of its fulfilment were the following. For nearly five centuries the presence of the Turk in Europe has been a source of distraction intrigue, and corruption in European politics, of oppression, and “ Isrule . t0 .p 6 nationalities, and an incentive to undue and overweening ambitions in the Moslem world. It has encouraged the Turk to regard himself as a Great Power, and enabled him to impose upon others the same illusion. It has placed him m a position to play off one Power against another, and in their jealousies and his own machinations to find pretexts for his continued immunity. It has been an inexpugna ile barrier o the solution of the Balkan problem or the full emancipation of the Balkan peoples. It has been an equal obstacle to the proper or good government of his own peop 1 ^. whose resources have been squandered in the polluted coulisses of C onstantinople or in the expenditure required for the upkeep of military and naval forces dispropoiDonate to the real strength or requirements of the Turkish nation. „ , , An opportunity of cutting out and getting rid for ever o: this plague spot such as has not arisen for centuries, has now presented itself. It may not recu for generations. The world is looking for great solutions. Let not this occasion it was argued, be missed of purging the earth of one of its most pestilent 100 s o evi . [7511On the other hand it was urged that the disappearance of the Turk wnue removing an admitted ill, will introduce a number o new ~ fiken complications in its place ; that if his claws be clipped, an a power , , i , away, he will become an innocuous if not a positive respectaole creature that, once his friendly relations with ourselves are resumed, he may even provide benevolent buffer between the ambitions of Europe and our own E ^ e ™^ that his expulsion would be a grave outrage to Mohammedan sentiment t g the world, and more particularly in India, where the success,ve blows “^er which the Sultan and his dominions have reeled m recent years are said to have^ created an unfavourable impression; and where this final sentence would be regarded as affront to Islam, prepared or connived m by Great Britain, the second greatest Mohammedan power in the world. . . . , u k In reply, however, to these forebodings, it was pointed out by many who have direct knowledge of India that the Indian Mohammedans have never attached anv particular sanctity or reverence to Constantinople ; that they have grown accustomed to the gradual diminution of the Ottoman power m Europe and A fr ica ’ that th J borne without excitement his expulsion from the Holy Places m the present war, that they have even fought against the Turkish armies m more than one campaign ; and that they evinced neither astonishment nor regret when the intentions ol the Allies with regard to Constantinople were announced to the world. So far indeed froin beino- surprised by their fulfilment, they would be more likely to regard it as a mar - o Allied weakness or of the Sultan’s diplomatic triumph if they were now abandoned. In this contest it was remarked that the present attitude of the Turk a 0118 an mo P e &gt; and his evasions and pretexts in respect of carrying out the armistice, are an eloquent confirmation of the position which he may be expected to assume should his adversaries be so weak or so foolish as to spare him. ^,11 • 1 , • r The question of the removal of the Turk was to some affected by considerations of the identity of his successor ; inasmuch as some, who were m favour of expulsion on t e merits, were disposed to qualify their views, unless satisfied as to the substitute by whom he would be replaced. IT This brings me to the second question—viz., whether, in the event of the disappear ance of the Turk, any foreign Power could profitably or safely be put m his place President Wilson is believed to favour the selection of some neutral State, there is no such State possessing either the prestige, the influence, or the resources that would iustify it for the task ; and the placing of Constantinople m the hands of a weak i ower would be not an avoidance but an encouragement of future trouble. Moreover, the selection of any such State would result in the embittered jealousy of those minor Powers who have for long aspired to the inheritance. Of these, Bulgaria was thought at one time, in the early stages of the first Balkan war, to have a good chance, but she forfeited it by her errors in the second Balkan campaign, and by her conduct in the recent war. Her selection would now be' impossible, and would arouse the undying animosity of Boumania and Greece. ... t • The latter Power could only be chosen at the cost of similar heart burnmgs.^ ^ She has no claim for so immense an increase of authority, which her slender military and naval resources would render her powerless to maintain, and the smaller but stil considerable extension of territory which she is likely to receive as the result of the war should more than satisfy both her ambitions and her deserts. Of the Great Powmrs France is already, as reported in the daily telegrams, endeavouring by every manner of means to establish a position of predominance 111 Constantinople, and, in the imperialistic spirit by which she appears to be animated,^ would doubtless clutch at a prize which would crown her position as the mistress of the Near East. These pretensions could not possibly be acquiesced in by Great Britain, and would meet with the relentless opposition of Italy. For similar reasons Italy would not be tolerated either by France or by ourselves. Great Britain, because of her traditional policy and her great Eastern connections, would in some respects be the most suitable heir to the Turk, and the choice would probably be more acceptable than any other to the Eastern world. But the main duties and responsibilities of Britain lie elsewhere ; she will emerge from the war with an increase of obligations which she will with difficulty sustain ; and no British Govern ment would dream of adding to them by the assumption of so vast and perilous a charge. There remains America. This solution has been urged by many, who are not merely anxious that the United States should take their share in bearing the burden of theEastern hemisphere, but who find in the detachment and presumed disinterestedness of America a sufficient guarantee for impartial administration. This view is also reported to find favour among considerable sections of the Young Turkish community, although it is rather as a screen and excuse for their own continued existence in Europe than as a ^^pubstitute in the seat of authority that the selection is urged by them. On the other hand, there are important sections of opinion in this, and probably win other European countries, who would regard the admission of America to the Mediterranean, and her installation at the gates of the Eastern and Western world, with unconcealed alarm, and these views are shared by our naval authorities, who apprehend that the appearance of the American flag in the Mediterranean would presently be followed by an American navy and American coaling stations, involving, in the last resort, a serious disturbance of the balance of naval power in those waters. These particular fears are, however, discounted by those who point out that it is in the highest degree unlikely that America would ever either desire or consent to become a European naval Power, and that, if she did so, the division of her naval strength that must ensue would be a source rather of weakness than of strength. On the whole, it seems unlikely that America would accept the charge, even if it were offered to her, except possibly in the minor capacity of a mandatory of a future League of Nations, and then only with the attributes, not of an independent ruler, but of an international policeman, appointed to perform certain limited functions of inter national control. Some of the advocates of this solution appear, however, to cherish visions of Constantinople as the future capital of a world-wide League of Nations, whence the controlling and pacifying sceptre of the United States would be wielded over the entire Eastern world, of which she would become the universal guardian. III. The successive elimination of the various possible or available Powers brings us to the discussion of the final alternative of some form of international authority ; and, many and obvious as are the objections to a condominium, it may yet be found that, short of keeping the Turk in his capital, this is the only possible alternative. The suggestion of such an authority, on the lines of the Suez Canal Commission, has already been made to his Government by. the French colleague of Admiral Webb at Constantinople. Some of the authorities who have favoured the suggestion have argued, upon the analogy of the Danube Commission, which sits at the Roumanian port of Galatz, but exercises no administrative functions ashore, that all that would be required is a body to look after the waterways, to maintain lights, buoys, and pilots, to collect dues, and to exercise a general control over navigation and shipping. Such a solution, it will be found upon examination, postulates, and is meant to postulate, the retention of the Turk. The arguments have already been given which lead many persons to think that this would, on its own merits, be an unmitigated evil. But it may also be contended that the evil, so far from being mitigated, would be enhanced, were an International Commission to be planted in a city where the Sultan continued to reside, and of which, as also of the European hinterland, the sovereignty still remained in his hands. We can easily imagine the atmosphere in which such a Commission (of which there could hardly fail, in these conditions, to be a Turkish member), would pursue its work—an atmosphere of incessant conspiracy and cabal. The wily Turk would revel in such a situation as affording renewed scope to his hereditary talents ; and round the pivot of his own plots would revolve a whirlwind of international intrigue, in which the representatives of all the nations, who still aspired to his inheritance, would eagerly mix. But little reflection, indeed, seems to be needed to show that the Commission and the Sultan could hardly be permanent bed-fellows at Constantinople. Just as the Americans, when providing for the future of the Panama Canal, felt bound to take a zone of land from Panama 5 miles in width on either bank, and to claim powers to appoint a Civil Governor and Civil Courts therein, so an International Commission, sitting in Constantinople, could not, in all probability, do its work, either with advantage or with due authority, unless it also took the capital, the hinterland up to the Chatalja lines, and possibly a strip of territory on either side of the Straits, under its administrative control. It is not thought that this need raise in any serious form the question of the remoter hinterland either in Europe or in Asia. On the contrary, it is argued that it would promote the pacific solution of that problem on ethnical lines that would satisfy the great majority of the populations concerned.4 On these principles Bulgaria 1 'the' 1 **secOT^Balkaii'war ; and tlie Greeks Midia line, which she so stupidly forfeited Thrace at Gallipoli and Bodosto, who constitute a majority of the population in Eastern Ihrace^at and in the islands of the Marmora, e Pf . , g er bians and Roumanians ol even said that M.

January 2, 1918.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] CONFIDENTIAL. I ! 9! 9 CONSTANTINOPLE AND INTER NATIONALISATION. •3 IT was agreed by the Eastern Committee that the navigation of the Straits (including the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus) should in future be open in both peace and Avar to the ships of all nations, but it was not settled under whose protection the maintenance of this right and the control of the shipping and naviga tion should be placed; although it was agreed that guarantees would be necessary. The proposal that the Turks should be ejected from Constantinople was objected to in some quarters on the ground that it would offend Moslem sentiment, and that it would be difficult to find a substitute. The Admiralty and some other authorities dislike the proposal to invite America to take charge, because such a responsibility might encourage her now, or at some future time, to increase her fleet and to maintain ships in the Mediterranean (where she has already sent ships in connection . with missionary questions). Their argument is that this might cause us embarrassment, and as it is generally agreed that harmonious co-operation with America must be the aim of British policy, the fewer the causes of possible friction the greater will be the chance of preserving good relations. On the other hand, it seems improbable that the United States, whose main interests lie in another continent, and whose sentiment is so strongly averse from intervention in European problems, will ever gravitate in the direction of serious rivalry with Great Britain, and if President Wilson indicates willingness to assume responsibility for the Straits, it would be difficult, and I think a mistake in policy, to discourage him. - It is generally agreed that no small Power should be entrusted with the control, even in a mandatory capacity. That Turkey’s mere undertaking to maintain Constantinople as a free port, and the freedom of navigation, would be insufficient requires no argument, and, if this be so, internationalisation appears to be the only solution. In the opinion of those who have studied this question, the control of the waters would necessarily entail the inclusion of a strip of territory on either side of the Straits, as was provided in the case of the Panama Canal, by the Panama Canal Act—on which a note is appended to this paper. I think it can also be demonstrated, on the analogy of the control exercised by America over the city of Panama and of Colon, that the city of Constantinople would have to be included in the zone. In any case, this extension of the sphere of influence of the Com mission would be so desirable that it is strongly recommended. Constantinople is, 'par excellence, the international city. Its population is more mixed than that of almost any other capital. The principle of internationalisation [779]2 has already been applied to Ottoman finance, to sanitary measures, and to other matters. The special rights and privileges accorded to foreigners and to foreign represen tatives have nowhere been so extensively claimed or so rigidly enforced. Both its strategic and its economic position mark it out as the possession not of one single State, but as that of the world. The arguments which have always been used in favour of leaving the Turk in his capital because he is harmless and easily controlled can hardly be repeated, with much conviction, since the events of November 1914. And even if we rule out the probability of another war, we may well deprecate a return to the old conditions when every Power was feverishly competing for favours from the Turk and bidding against each other, at the expense of the subject races, for the grant of concessions and privileges. Internationalisation would mitigate this evil and it would place the city for ever outside the ambitions of any of the States who have coveted its possession—of Bulgaria, of Greece, and of Bussia, whose secular claims would probably be reasserted if she were ever recon stituted as an Empire. The objections to internationalisation are generally based on its alleged un workability. These are formidable as are those which are opposed to other solutions. Sometimes the case of Egypt is mentioned as an example to be avoided ; but Egypt does not present a true analogy, as has been ably pointed out by Mr. Leonard Woolf in his book on the future of Constantinople. It would be courting failure to coniine the Commission to representatives of the Great Powers principally interested in the Near East. The history of the Danube Commission furnishes con vincing proof of this. It has been suggested by Mr. Woolf in his book to which I have referred that, “ An International Commission for the Straits and Constantinople would have to be a reasonably small body representing States with no direct interest in the Near East. “ It might, e.g., consist of representatives of the United States, of Holland, and of Switzerland—who might either be appointed directly by those States, or, better still, by the Powers representing the League of Nations by whom their powers would be defined.” The chairman might always be a United States citizen. As I have already observed such a Commission would necessarily be obliged to exercise jurisdiction, such as that exercised in Panama by the United States Govern ment, who were given power by the Act to have a civil Governor and civil courts in the zone. Were the Turks to remain in Constantinople occasions of conflict and of obstruction would constantly arise, and if they were removed to Brusa the Commission would naturally extend their duties to the administration of the whole city. If such a Commission worked successfully their functions might be expanded in the direction of con trolling the great arteries of railway communication, such as the Anatolian railw r ay as far as the Turkish frontier, and, by means of delegation, the Caucasian through rail way also. The difficulty of overcoming objections to the expulsion of the Turk remains if the Indian Government, on consideration, are disposed to maintain them.3 /' l Sir Valentine Chirol’s opinion, and that of Sir A. Hirtzel, are a powerful contribution to the arguments in favour of expulsion. Possibly if the proposal for internationalisation were put forward by President Wilson the odium would not fall exclusively on Great Britain, but would be shared by all alike. Provision might possibly be made for saving the face of the Sultan and Caliph by maintaining the Palaces of Dolmabatjeke and Yildez Kiosk as residences for His Majesty should he care to visit them. Their exterritoriality might even be allowed, if it were under stood that His Majesty’s principal residences would be in Asia Minor. A public declaration should be made by the Powers of their intention to respect the Mosques, including that of Santa Sofia. They might be left to the guardianship of the Sultan. A word is necessary as to the disposal of the rest of Turkish territory in Europe. I concur with Sir Eyre Crowe in suggesting its assignment to Bulgaria and Greece, if that be in accordance with the arrangements which M. Venizelos has come to with Servia and Boumania. This solution would relieve us of the difficulty in Asia Minor caused by the large population of Greeks on the Smyrna coast, as M. Venizelos gave me to under stand that, if Greek aspirations were met in Thrace he would be very moderate in his demands in Asia Minor. If not, he would have to press for the assignment of the coastal region of Asia Minor to Greece. LOUIS MALLET. December 25, 1918. Annex I. From a perusal of the Act providing for the open ing, &amp;c., of the PananH Canal it appears clear that the Government of Panama by the treaty of the 26th February 1904, ceded to the United States Government the “ use, occupancy, or protection ” of the canal zone, i.e., land and water within five miles on each side of a line drawn down the centre of the canal, but excluding the towns of Panama and Colon and their harbours. There does%iot seem to have been any explicit transfer of sovereignty, but the Act gave the United States Government power to have a civil governor of the zone and civil courts, and, generally speaking, to set up a regime with full .powers to care, manage, maintain, provide sanitation for, operate and protect the canal and zone. In practice (whatever the theory) the United States Government have acted as though there had been a transfer of sovereignty, notably in the matter of fortifying the canal. Similarly the Bepublic of Panama has always been an United States protectorate in all but name. The United States has intervened in the Presidential elections, usually on the pretext of maintaining order— an excuse for which there has been some foundation. They have also on occasions replaced the police of Panama by United States marines when there has been trouble between the police and United States liberty men. On the last occasion of the kind they insisted dh-i 1 ; I *ki 7 upon the disarmament of the Panamd, police because an United States sailor had been shot. (There was much to be said on both sides.) , As regards the canal itself it will be remembered that when it was opened for traffic the United States Government endeavoured to discriminate m tavour ol their own shipping in the matter of tolls, contrary to the clear meaning of the Hay-Pauncefote Tieaty. l:-'I V r (r ; ' S 3 E C H S T » y ■ :: K . yfy . / .• - ; “■ it C-* V 1;S O^BIlfBT • E A a T E H II COH M I T T S 3.

SHORT'ELJJD HOTEd of a Looting of the Commit toe held in Lord Cnrzon’s Room at the Invy Council Offioe on Londay t December Cord, 191^, at 11.30 a.m. \ \ THE CHLIHLUI: The Committoo hue hud circulated to it papers v/hich, I am afraid, everybody has not had time to read, from the foreign Office, written by Sir Eyre Crov/o, from the Ear Offioo and from the Admiralty, and tv/o papers placed in our hands this morning from the India Office and the foreign Secretary of - t ^ c; Government of India* ierhaps it may help matters a little and place our discussion in the proper focus, if, having read all these papers rather carefully, I preface our discussion by a brief statement on the lines of the statements that I have ma&lt;le hero before. ho may start, I think, by tvo axiomatic propositions which nobody will bo concerned to dispute. The first of these is the enormous strategical and political importance given to the power that holds Constantinople. That is demonstrated by the historical argument in the paper of tho General Staff; and one need only refer in a sentence to tho two or three occasions in history in which the possession of Constantinople has deflected the whole history of the world. The first was when the aoman Empire moved to By wantram wirh its incalculable results on the fate not only of the Roman Emmire but of the whole eastern world. The second was when the Turks, ciossing the Bosphorus and establishing themselves in Constantinople, practically altered the history of the world for the next five centuricSo Tho third was the prodigious effect that has been exercised upon our own policy by the presence of the Turks in Constantinople, which was really the basis of the entire old Eastern policy of ^reat Britain. Ityvug, in the main,.. because the 'iurh was at Constantinople that Cjtl \;e fought tho Crimean v ’ar. It was for the same reason that \:e interfered to tear up the 1 rooty of nun otephuno* Indeed, : 1 up to the last twenty years* when Lord Salisbury first hazarded 1 a doubt as to whether wo had not put our money on the wrong ^iorse, the whole orientation of our Las torn policy has been determined by the position of the Indian Lmpiro at one end and by the position of the lurh astride of the. straits at the other. I need not ^ aste more time upon that, fhc second axiomatic proposition is th^t the presence of the Turfs in juropc has been ^ source of unmitigated evil to everybody concerned, I a:n not aware of a single interest, Turfash or otherwise that during nearly five hundred years has benefited by that presence, -They have introduced a most distracting and demoralizing influence into Luropean polities. be on Thoir presence has I think/equally injurious to Islandcm bo'arisc of the pretensions and aspirations it has encouraged,. It has been absolutely disastrous to the various Subject races, both in Luropc and in xia,. with whom they have had to deal. Indeed the record is one of misrule, oppresoion, intiiguo and massacre almost unparalleled in the history of the eastern world, finally, the possession of the straits has enabled the Turks, if wo take only the case of this war, to exercise an influence altogether disproportionate to any position that they would otherwise occupy in the world. It was their presence in Constantinople and the fortification of the otraits that -prevented Lusoia. out aiming her exit into the no &amp; i t c rra.no &lt; -.n, that brought in the Lalkan states in the early d.-^ys of the vrar, that was responsible for our unfortunate failure, con ceived on the soundest strategical lines as the venture was, at Gallipoli and at the Dardanelles; and really the last four ya-ars are a convincing proof ox the prodigious inxlucnce that the posseseiou of the atraits and Cons t...ntinoplc enables the lower vlaced in that position to exercise, perhaps even morethan before, under the conditions of modern warfare. V.'hat' arc the factors we now have to doal with ? V*c arc discussing today what ought to be the fate of the territories of the 'Turk in nuropo, of Constantinople and the area around it, fhc population of Turkey in nurope at the beginning of war was under t\ o millions. I fancy, from such informat ion as X have been enabled to procure, that it is not much more than a million and a half now. Contrast with this the population of Turkey in Asia. Take Asia Minor. I am giving the pro-Year figures. i;o doubt they are much reduced by the sufferings duo to the war. The population of ...sia Minor was 10 millions, of Armenia and kurdistan two and a half millions, of Mesopotamia two millions, of byria throe and a half millions, of Arabia one million. If we add together the whole of the last-named groups which are going to be taken from Turkey in any case, and which amount to nine millions, we leave in Asia Minor a population of ten millions for the Turk as compared with the lose than two millions that are still under his rule in Muropc, MR, EiLROUR: By 'Turks* 1 you mean Turkish subjects; you do not exclude Greeks V THE GHiilPlhill: I am including everybody for the moment, The exact proportions of the Greeks, Turks, Armenians, and so on, in the whole area it is difficult to determine, When we come to Gonstantinoplo it is easier to determine the exact proportions*, Constantinople at the beginning of the v/a.r was believed to have two millions of people. At the present moment I expect it has decidedly less than three quarters of a mi^liom However, the actual total is immaterial. The proportions are important. Prom a comparison of the various tables of statistics that I have been able to refer to, I fancy that the following is about the truth, and it is very material in helping us to arrive at a decision. Out of every hundred people in Constan tinople approximately forty are Turks* twenty are Greeks, nine teen are Armenians, fourteen are Jev/s and other foreigners, and the balance is made up by a floating residuum Thus you see,even in Constantinople itself, contrary to the beliof, I believo, entertained by most people in this country, perhaps by some of us at this table, the furies arc not a majority of the population. Those arc the factors are regards population v/ith vh ich we have to deal. To what extent are we committed with regard to Constanti nople b$ anything that has been said by us or by our Allies during tho war ? In the earlier days of tho war, in iiarch 1915, ;ir„,.squith *s Government entered into an engagement with the Kussian Government^ if tho war was successful, to hand over to hussia not only Constantinople but a substantial strip of territory on both sides of tho btraits. This strip of territory subtended not only the Bosphorus but the boa of Marmora and the Dardanelles, and it would have been placing Russia not only in possession of tho City itself but of the whole of the approaches to and the exits thorefror It is unnecessary for us to discuss here the i.isdom or the policy of that act. I profoundly deplored it at the time, because I regarded it jbas fraught with great danger to the common cause, and even to Russia herself, who, I think, would have suffered irramed- iably had she boon persuaded to ooiao down from tho 1'orth and embark on the wholly different sphere of politics which the possession of Byzantium would have opened out before her. Thr.it is, however, only a dictum of my own. Russia has disappeared .from the scene, the treaty has lapsed, and we need not spend much of our ^ time in considering it. The second stage was when, in January 1917, wo drew up, in conference with our Allies in Downing Street, the famous declarat ion of our aims in reply to the American iioto. X forgot the exact terms employed; but we did distinctly include in that statement * the expulsion of the Turk from Suropo. blight apparent modification of that attitude have been visible since. Our Brim© Minister, in a speech which ho made in January of tho present year, used this language« He said that Great Britain did not challenge the main tenance of Turkey or of tho Turks in the; homeland of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople. Asia Minor is not the- ' ■ &lt;g) &gt; ^ homeland of the Ottoman Turka. But vith-ut debating that p dnt, ctill It o &gt; io Turkey in Eunp« their homeland, and therefore when he eprk^ of the homeland with its capital, if he meant that the capital was in any way con nected with the homeland, of course he was saying what was historic ^ally and ethnically inaccurate* What exactly he meant ky his state* ment I do not recollect. I think that it 7 /a 3 made at a moment when we were hoping to persuade the Turk to give in, and it was considered desirable to say something somewhat reassuring to him. A little later, in fact only a month or so ago, Lord Robert Ceoil (he 7 /ill correct me if I am wrong) made a abatement in the House of Commons in which the words, as I have them here, were as follows. He said H A great deal is to be said for too ejection of tho Turk from Constantinople; but do not forgot that Constantinople is a predominatiy Turkish country.' LORD ROBERT CECIL: Yes. THE CHAIRMAN: lust before you came into the room I ventured to point out to bh£ Committee that that was inaccurate, bdoausc, so far from it being a predominantly Turkish capital, only corty per cent of the population are Turks themselves. Still they have nearly one half. LORD ROBERT CECIL: And of course they are very much larger than any other single element. THE CHAIRMAN: Yes; but they are only about equal to the Greeks and the Arm nians. LORD ROBERT CECIL: That is right. THE CHAIRMAN: And be it remembered that out of the population of Constantinople a large number, supposing that the Government wort; moved, wonld drift over to Asia 7/ith the Turxs, because of the officials and their families who have collected there and battened upon the place for years but who hav; no necessary con nection with Constantinople itself. I do not think how. ver that in anything that has been said hers there have: been words which commit us irretrievably upon the matter, and even if th&lt; y committed us they would not commit our Allies, and I imagine that Mr. Balfour would agrte that at the Allied Conference when it moots at Paris we have really a / . \ \)lperfectly free hand with our Allies to discuss the fate of Constantinople and to make such dispositions as the congress of Europe may decide upon. MR. MONTAGU: There is another quotation from the Prime Minister's speech. Will you gire us that ? It is quoted in Sir Eyre Crowe’s paper. M We are not fighting to depri to Turkey of its capital.” THE CHAIRMAN: I think that it is the same speech that I was referring to. * There- sc-wms to he presented to us, accordingly, if the powers decide to take it, ene of the great opportunities that ha Ye arisen^ in the history of the world. Assuming what I have said about tho perniaio’US influence which has he-.n exercised by the Turkish presence in Constantinople to be true, here at last is an occasion when it might be possible. -- I do not argue for the moment whether it is desirable -- to cut out this canker vhich really has poisoned the life of Europe. I exptet that if we could look to the opinion of the civilised countries through the world they would be bitterly we disappointed if, for reasons of political expediency or other wise, the opportunity was not taken at any rate to consider most seriously the question of getting rid of this running sore for ever. What ar&lt; tiu solutions which are possible , vhich are open to us to consider ? Upon certain points, I gather from the papers and ^ I indeed from the discussions in the Press, everybody is agreed. Whether you keep the Turk there or whether you turn him out, there, must bo some kind of international guarantee for the future system that is to be set up at Constantinople and the surrounding territory Secondly the wattrvayc -- and by that, of course, I mean the pardan-llv o, the Marmora and the Bosphorus, must be absolutely free both for the merchant shipping and for the ships of •'nr of all the povvrs cf all the world. Thirdly, the forte by vhich those narrow passages are defended must cither bs disarmed or razed to this ground. I believf those to be initial propositions upon which every body is agreed* Then we come to the- much more difficult question, to whom is the governin'; nt or the control of .this area to‘b* gi'-en ? I am assuming for the moment -- I shall haw to revert to this later -- that tho Turkish Government disappears from the scene and that some otherqo Tcrnmcnt i3 put into its plaow. The ground may, at this stag^, X think, bs very quickly cleared. It must be chv i v.us, I think, to g verybody, that ths custodian or th&amp; ^trustee cannot be on. of the smaller or ra ak r Po'^trs of Europe o Whatever claim Bulgaria may hav% had at any time, at the commence ment &lt;f the first Balkan war, vhen sht set mod to be striding rapidly in the direction of Constantinople, and p«-.wple talked about th&lt; Cross being placed again on the cupola of St. Sophia, and Bulgaria’s secular ambitions seemed to have some chance of realisation, all that has no*' disappeared, and the trea.cht.ry and the crimes of tho Bulgarian, people and Government during this war have effectively removed any chance that Bulgaria might have, quite- apart from the fact that no other Balkan state would be vdlling to admit ht-r. The second small state that must bo eliminated is Greece. We shall have difficulty enough in settling the homo borders of Greece in he r relations with her neighbours without contemplating for a moment such a vast experiment as handing over to her the fate of Constantinople. Her own position even if it were given to her is not strong enough to enable her to hold it any rate beyond quite a small length of timz. Her own shores w-uld be separated Admiralty ? from those of Constantinople, and, as the War office has pointed out in any struggle in the futurt those, responsible for h^r existence w.-uld have 'f necessity the ••cry onerous rt sponsioility of defending the shores of Greece in different parts of the Mediterranean that are particularly difficult to protect. I think that v-c shall all agree, for o the r it as ..ns as well that I ne-..d not enter into hv.re, that Greece cannot be- considered. Ho ether small pQYt.r is worthy of a moment’s attention. Our m.xt qu.sticn is. Can it t&gt;t a gr at European Po-.r ? Here re can proceed just as quickly 1=7 the method of cxhauotlcn. Russia has forfeited her claim and had disappeared from the scene.. As to France and Italy, neither v.-oulc. agreed for a moment to the appoint mont of the v ther; nor sh'-ulo. we.', I imagine, agree to eitherourselves. I think that they must h« wiped off 1jhe slate. I hop® that the ^smmittee do net think that I am dealing in a dogmatic or arbitary v^ay with this problem. I am merely trying to save time. One could argue thd case of Russia or France or Italy for ten ^minutes each. The remaining great power which is possible is Orreat Britain. I dare say that most of us at the bottom of our hearts think that best Great Britain is the/qualified for the task, and could undertake it with the greatest advantage to the people themselves. A tele gram came in only yesterday from Constantinople indicating that offers of that sort are not unlikely to be made ta us by the Turks themselves. But I assume that we should agrs® that it is absolute ly out of the question that we, with our vast burden, are going, \ even if we are invited to do so either by the Turks themselves or by the League of Nations, to assume the further responsibility of taking in hand the future of Constantinople. If any opinions are entertained to the contrary, we could perfectly v r ell argue it at this table; but I do not argue this myself because I really assume it to be out of the question. The smaller Powers and the greater powers having thus been hypothetically eliminated,there remain two or three other alter natives , One is that of a condominium, the policy that, whenever mentioned is only mentioned to bo rejected, but that sometimes has to be adopted as a pis aller because no other can be found. International boards do exist for the control of the navigation of the Danube and other rivers. They have been tried in other parts of the world. Th^ other day when we were talking about the Caucasus, as we explored the different possibilities of military occupa tion, British, French and otherwise, it was Lord Robert Cecil, I think, who said 'Well after all, we may have to come back to the idea of an international force,' which we had ail rejected. There fore I suppose that it is not impossible, perhaps it is not unlikely that in the case of Constantinople, if every Power, great or small, is rejected one after the other, some kind of international - 8 -constitution may have to he set up In order to rule, as well as it could (l an afraid that it would he very badly) the City and the adjacent areas. But I feel that it is quite unnecessary to explore tha.t solution, because it is one, I imagine, to which the Powers v/ould ohly be driven in the 1 au't resort. The last suggestion is Africa, and, from th rt evidence that has/been put before us here, we Know, firstly, that America has been, through her missions and otherwise, warmly interested in Constantinople for a long time, and, secondly, that th^re exists a strong party in Constantinople, I believe, the C.U.P. and their followers, who ) largely for interests of a selfish nature, are anxious to bring America in, and mak* her the mandatory pow*r. I should say in passing that I think that they are much more con cerned in doing that in ord^r to save their own skins and to preserve the. simulacrum of Turkish rule and authority in Europe than they are from any regard either for the int^r-sta of their own populations or from any sympathy with reform in the future. But let that pass. Th-re i^'and th^r** may be a decided movement to bring the Americans in. Whether America would accept the responsibility I do not know. In all our discussions during th* past f-w we*ks we have been proceeding upon the hypothesis that, having done so much to promote th“ scheme of a League of Nationd, America will be almost bound, in honour as well as in logic, to tak# hax share in bearing the responsibility, '^eth^r that will carry her so far as to assum*- ah obligation of this sort is a question on which I have- always had v-ry grav* doubt myself, but which no doubt we aha11 see r-'solved in th* course of th* next few weeks. I do not therefore attempt to discuss the question whether America would bs likely to accept th~ charge if it were offered to her. An entirely different point is raised by the attitud* of our Naval authorities her-, who think that the position of the American* in any important post in the Eastern part of the Mediterranean would be a source of naval dans-’r to this country. They feel that whatever arrangements were made in advance, wnatever restrictions were imposed as regards military or naval L.N - 10 - strength, sooner or lat-r A]r*rica ^ould acquire a navg, and that having acquired a navy she would require a naval hase, and naval . stations, and so on, and that we should h~ admitting to European politics a new balance of naval power in Europe, a disturbing and, possibly, in the long run, a maleficent influence* I can giv* no opinion dh that» My opinion is worthless. I confess that I do not fully understand it. I do not fully und^rrtand why, if America were to assume such a responsibility as we are now discussing in Constanti nople or even Palestine or elsewhere, she must necessarily have a big fleet for the purpose, must n ■ cessarily have a naval base, and must necessarily embark upon a policy of competition with ourselves. The naval authorities no doubt will develop that point of view. I only, in passing, venture to say on my own account that I do not fully understand or appreciate the scale of the danger which they seem to put so high themselves. These are the various candidates that have been named. Before we go further it s-'-em? to mo-' 1 we have to consider, whoever is to be at Const antinople, the exact relations in which, ba it America or be it a condominium, they are to be placed to the people themselves. ^ Do you contemplate placing this power in Constantinople and leaving the Turks ther*? Do you contemplate leaving Turkish population and eliminating the Turkish Government ? Or do you contemplate leaving eome form of Turkish Government in Constantinoplc or, if it is essential, side by side with the mandatory power exercising police functions in Constantinople and the Straits? That really raises very big issues in international Ipolicy. Those who feel very strongly that the opportunity ought not to be lost of getting rid of the Turk base their arguments upon what 3 '«m to me to b* very powerful grounds indeed. T^ey say that it is th* prosene- of the Turks in Constantinople that during all these centuries has giv-m the world the impression that Turkey is one of the great Powers of th- ; world. Certainly their presence ■ y there has enabled Turkey to pose as a great European Pow^r, and these pretensions would absolutely disappear if she wer^- turned out of Turkey and'removed to the 1 other side of the Straits. Secondly I 1I imagine that her pre^ nce in ‘Surope muet have had an **normoufl effect in augmenting the prestige and power of Islam throughout the world, ond in giving encouragement to th** creed of Pan-Islam about which we have heard so mach in recent times. Another point that the advocates of the expulsion of the Turk lay great stroec upon — and it appeals to me very strongly **- is this. Just as Byzantium-in the old days of the Eastern Homan Empire was a sink of corruption and iniquity unparalleled in the ancient world, so undoubtedly is Constantinople today. St&amp;mbul in the hands of tho Turks has been not only the hotbed of every sort of Eastern vice but it has really been the source from which the poison cf corruption and intrigue has spread far and wide into Europe itself. The presence of the Turks at Constantinople has been an ulcer in the side of Europe. If we could got rid of them, if 7/0 could agree on the 'bag and baggage' policy of Mr. Gladstone and remove them to tht* other side, we should all feel, that a kind of miasma had disappeared from the atmosphere of Europe. Further their removal would immensely encourage the progress o$the Balkan communities to the bigger future that lies before them. If, on the other hand, Turkey remains in any capacity you will always feel that in the background the old system is struggling again into existence, the kind of thing that Aodul Hamid brought/'perfection in the course of his long and bloodstained career, and which there is a glorious opportunity of getting rid of for over. It is also to be remembered that if she goe'3 it would probably be the very bast thing that could happen to herself and to her own people. Those who know the Turk in hio own highlands in Asia Minor and elsewhere always speak of him with rerrpect as a simple- minded worthy fellow who dislikes as much as anybody &amp;lse the eyst-m of corruption and intrigue that goes on at headquarters, who would much pr*f*r living his own simple *xist*nc&lt;* detached from Europe and all governing influences altogether. 11Further it io to fcorao in mind that if Turkey turned out of Europe she Trould lose the temptation to spend the ®nomouo suma she has had to squander on maintaining an army and a navy, at any rate an army, to sustain the illusion that she is a great j^ower. Lastly (this brings ne rather into collision witht^e vieva that are put forward by Sir Hamilton Grant of the Government of India) if the Turk were turned cut of Europe it would settle to my mind for all time the question of the Khalifate. How has the Ottoman Sultan been able, through all these c&amp;uturies, to hold the position of Khalif? As is well kmown he is not of the Krrsish family, and from the point of view of descent his claim to the spiritual supremacy is as we know } widely disputed in the Moslem world. Ke has been enabled to keep it, in the main, for two reasons. Firstly, because he has been the custodian of the Holy Places, and, secohdly, because he has had Constantinople. The first has given him great spiritual distinction and authority over the Moslems all over the world. The second has enabled him to pose as the groat Islamic power. Ha has already lost the Holy Places. If he also loses Constantinople, it seems to me, his chances of retaining the Khalifate ar'* g$ne. What they may be if he remains there I do not know. I should think that they are doubtful. If he loses Constantinople I imagine that there can be very little doubt that the Mahomedan world will not accept as a Khalif a sovereign who has been dispossessed of Constantinople, Mecca and Medina, and who has been driven back into the highlands of Asia. I have stated what seem to be the reasons for getting rid of the Turk from Europe altogether. Mow let ua consider the reasons against. Firstly, we are told that it would outrage Mahomedan sentiment throughout the world. I very much wonder if that would be the case myself. This war had really applied a wonderful test-stone to the solidarity cl Islam, and as the various Powers who have been fighting the Turk, and so many of whom have large Turkish possessions of their own, whEsther they be in Africa or in Asia, successively-13- % oam€ into ther 11 his Mahomodan subjects would dislike tho iaot thut wo wex^Ti^jxtin^; the Turks so much the t trouble t*.nd revolution might break out, iaot that the Moslem world as a whole would be outraged at the idea of our being ,.ar with tho Turk* Bo fc.r as I uiow those ex pectations have been falsified. \Vhen we ccme to India, about wldoh Sir Hamilton Grant h^s out in a very powerful plea as to tho feelings of the Indian Mnhomedana and their great sonso of outrage an! indignity if tho Turks ware turned out of Constantinopie, v/ith all respoot I do not agree the least in the world. I believo th..t the Moslem sentiment about Constantinople is one of purely modern creation, I do not believe that it existed fifty years ago. It wes largely the fuss we ourselves nuc.e about Turkey at the time of the Crimean tfar ^nd the fact that our policy was so much indeatified with that of Turkey that first induced tho Mahomedans of India ^ to begin to look towards Constantinople and to regard tho Sultan as tli ; ir Spiritual Chief*. I wu.s in India when the Tur .s w.re at War with Greecej and all sorts of apprehensions wore expressed .3 to the possible attitude of the Moslems in India. They did not turn a heir. In the Same way when the kirst ft n Second Balkan o/ars took place end Turkey wan gradually being driven back and Constantinople was at one time in danger, I do not a ay that anxi,ty w s not expressed in India; but nothing serious took uk.oo. In this war, again where the strain h-s boon immeasurably greater u .on Moslem sentiment thaoi it ever h: 3 b.-jon before, is it not a most nk rtling and rom^rk- able fr et th t the Moslems of Indie have acoeptec tho ^ositie,* with the loyalty .nd equanimity they hc.voV If Bir Hamilton Gr^nt refo-s, as he may do, to more recent nnnifo’t tions, I would reply to him that tho H .iondist Moalem movement in India is much more oonoernoc in sym ^thizing with tho Young Turk because the Young Turk is nti^British, th.n bec.uoo he is a Moalom.

I do not think th-t P.-.n-Isluiiivem hc.s ^ny lly subetejatial hold in India at all* How, ooming to the end, whe-t I have 3c.id would indioate that in my judgmont, for wh^t it is worth, tho urgnments in favour of seizing this opportunity on jolting rid of the Turk altogether from L v aro &gt;o, aro orodominent* That still loaves unsolved tho question of whether there is to be a condominium or v.hother it is to bo the Amofio t ,n.8. .Perhaps the authorities hero, who aro nuch oeiter qualified tnan 1 would toll mo what aro tho kinds of limitations that could bo a^cod upon thoir exorcise of authority. V/ould it bo -ossible, if you put the .Americans thoro (I am assuming that the Turks havo gono) to place them There with a'sort of municipal ccministration . f Constantino'lc, with a force thi.t Vvould on ble them to police the City and such surrounding districts as T/vrc loft, with vsuch naval foroo, ^'d±n, ts would on^blc them to patrol tho waters of tho Straits, end so on, with no foc.rs of their thus orOuting a considerable naval force, in fact to allow or invite the Americans simply to discharge the functions of proserving law and order and oonduc .ing locul , dministrution within that tht-t area? I cannot mys ;lf soo thaty need necessarily bo impossible; but it is not acco 'ted in any of the .npers end therefore I venture merely to uUggest thu idea* There is tho last su gostion of all, which is strongly favoured by tho wt,r Office in thofr paper, and which also, X ; ,.thor, is tho viov; of tho Government of Im. i •, v nd that is to louvo the Turk alone Intsrnationclizo tho Straits, knock down tho forts, louVo tho Suiten lo-.vo tho Seraglio, loavo the Sublime iorto, l.a vo -11 thy venerable- relics ef tho lest five huixdrod yo.. rs in Constantinople, deprive him of all real military powur, end nsume th/t, chastened by discstor and inca &gt;aoitate&amp; by v»oakno'S, ho will be u com j ratively respect, ble man ixi the future* hut is o solution which the w. r Office recommond, and which, on ground- urtly olitical and a rtly -ntimental a good many others favour* I confess th-t I am entirely ..gainst it*■'‘WS.SKffiJ’ J1 I do not bollora .ill oum^tuEioes ^..-.tsoover» I think that onco you leave the Turk in Itfurooc ^3 a fovorning force ha will go on doing exactly the same as before. There will be u revival f the old intrigues, and ho will presently begin his old game again of trying to sot the lowers at loggerheads with each other and profiting by their squabbles. Therefore, so far as I am com otent to givo an opinion, I am in favour of the olo,..n cut; but in what I huve said X have been more oonoernod with trying to do justice to the various views put forward than I have boon to urgo any individual opinions of my own. MlicMONTaGU; I fool very strong dissent from your conclusion, and^ therefore perhaps you v/ould not mind me, in a few words, stating the reasons of that dissent, because it seems to me that before wo discuss who shall be the mandatory sower there, the first thing to decide is whether the Committee agrees with your very povwerful argu ment for turning the Turk out bar and baggage or could be induced to agree with the argument I am going to put forward. The view of th.e military authorities and of the War Office is th,..t the Turk should be loft where ho is# I would point out that you did not scorn enamour ed of any of the resultant clans with which you dealt on the ex elusion of the Turk. You hypothetically eliminated him, and the greater lowers and the smaller Powers, and you were then left either with a condominium, which you disliked, or with the United States which the Admiralty dislikes, and which In our discussions at the Cabinet it was very clear that some of our colleagues very much disliked. I would suggest tfu.t if there was no better reason the fact that you cannot find a power that you really like to replace the Turk would lead one to hesitate to remove the Turk in order to em bark u'’on a scheme which may not be any more satisfactory than the Turk himself. I assume that we c.re all agreed on the intemotional~ ization end the neutralization of the Straits and Mariner a. What are the reasons that you allege most strongly for removing the Turk? First of all you said th,.t it w^s not the homeland of the Turk and that tho Yrime Minister had been historic.lly inaccurate in using that phrase. I think that it is tho homeland Of the Turk The fact that ho has only gone there to live of comOc.ratively recent years does not revent its boira Ills home# You would bodepriving the 2urk of that country which is now his main home and of his Capital at a time when you arc depriving him of very large portions of his territory in Asia. it not fair to st- to that many of the atua** duo to tho existence of the lurk in Constantinople are duo to his control over the Straits and to his rule of such countries as Armenia, which you are going to de.orivo him of? Is it not possible that Turkish rule in Constantinoole would be much less intclerabl® wh'n those groat oowors c r^ removed from him? I look at this much more from tho point of view of the Indian Mahommedan* I would like to say a few words in amplification of what Sir Hamilton Grant has ’written on that subjout. ho lot us remember that v/bother you could have conquered the Turk without the Indian Muhammodan or not, it was the Indian Muhammodan that conquered him. It is o nir. to argument (it certainly h. s been argued in some of the more scurrilous Indian nowsp^-ers) thc.t you failed to conquer the Turk when you did not use any large number number of Indian troops, but tin t you did conquer him when Indian troops took u^ the burden of the i ork in Mesopotamia and in x\..l-stine. THH CKAlHiviAH: You say that we c onque-red him by the aid of tho Mohammedan troops. Is that borne out by the figures? If you take, tho Indian forc-s fighting the Turk in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and caftewhoro, do you mean to tell no that the larger proportion wore Mohammedans? 0N1,.GU: The best of them would be Punjab Muhammadans, with the Indian Muhammadan the Turk was conquered* Tha best Province for recruiting puroos s during the ,a.r was the Pan jab, which is wh oily Muhammdan * THP : I think you are st. .tins your o&lt;..s : ■ much too high. In a good many )l&amp;c..s wo had to be careful about employing Muhamm,;dans. Difficulties arose in Gallipoli and difficulties also aroso in Mesopotamia. I would like to put in a caveat against accepting tho proposition that wodefeated the- Turk by moans of Ivluhammodans of India. ?hey -17- lent valuable assistance;. but it was no moro. Iho bulk of the fighting was dona by ncio-Muhammodan races. 'That is my belief* kk. MONTAGU: I base my argument upon the- magnificent recruiting work; tho staple part of tho Indian army came from the Punjab and was mainly Huh ammo dan • I quite agree that there was trouble in the earlier stages of the war ’with certain regiments because they were fighting tho lurks, which shows that dcs '&gt;ito tho fc.ot that they loyally assisted us in our war against tho lurk, there was a terrific strain upoii their loyalty. I view with horror tho argument that because continuous strains havo boon put upon tho loyalty of the'Muhsmmedans which thsy have nk-gnificent 1 y withstood, therefore you are not to consider their views in the Settlement of this question. Ihe argument that poo )lo have threatened rebellion and outbreak if oeiuoain things were done which might out a strain uoon the Muhammed^u loyalty, but than a hat proohecy has not bc-an fulfilled is ala the moro roc son hy we should consider Muhammadan feeling. It ic not really Constantinople that I am afraid of. It is the idea thM; this country ha.s become a anti-Muhammedan State which hac led ail through the Balkan wars which yen referred to, to the r radual downing of Muhammedism and driving it Eastward - the war of tho It li ns in Iripoli and the Balkan war t I was in India at the time, or .'ust afterwards, and I rescembor the tremendous grief with which certain speeches of Mr, Asquith. Mr. Lloyd Goorge and Mr. winston Cburohi11 were commented upon by the Indian news capers as shewing that this country was ant i~Muhamme-dun. ,/hen you come to talk about the Khali fate and Che eutremo unli. elinoss of the Suit nr of Turkey remaining Khalif if he is turned out of Constantinople, I would say with great respect that wo iuve solemnly declared that we are not going to interfere in any way with tho free choice of Khalif, and therefore I do not think that we ought,, even in privacy, to allow1 - 16 - that argument to affect the decision in the least* l/e ought to stick; to our declaration that \;-q ai 11 axprose no opinion, xihoevor the xiuhaoiiedans choose to oleot as their Khalif* TH3 CHmlHivldJ: T'h t doos not prevent us from forecasting the possible consequences. 1.1,1* i.iOliThGU: The list thing that I vould say is this. If you roinombor, alien His ,.10.jesty wont to address ?i ; .rliament and tho representatives of the Dominions in tho House of Lords, he referred to tho rescue of Palestine for Christianity* There r/ero several comments upon that at the tine* We h'd used Lluhanmod::n troops.

I do not believe tlia t that was over suggested. IviH* ilODTalU: I con no b find it ^t the moment because I have not 6 ot it, but I am sure that my memory is accurate on tho suojoct ho cause it gave rise to so many re ore senta tions to me, i nd it seamed to me to shor ho-'- earoful we ought to bo.' finally, I would remind you of this, the Prime minister has appointed two represent tivos of India to tame their share in the Imperial deliberations on Po co. By an ccident it so happens that ooth those 6 e n tie non are Hindus ■ ad there is no Huharmiedan ropresontrtion directly accessible to mo, arm therefore it scorned to me that it boho/os us to bo all the more careful that iluh/mmodtn interests are not forgotten. It does scorn to mo trot Lord Cur son has shown us satisfactorily taut there is no good solution by driving out the Turk, and that wo nr a i.** a position to consider rruhammodan fooling which is so loyal end which is lively to remain loyal, and v e have every reason to consider it in the solution.- 19 - _ 13 * BALFOtm: 1 h^ve no doubt ths.t tho iiuootiPin i» on® of uaetrem^ V difficulty-* '^-a, by ^ • Montagu, I am not at all &lt; ualifiod to speak* I have no. sentiuent in India, f.nd It n-ould be folly for no to offer an opinion on the subject.

If anybody would look at tho map of tho Turkish Umpire cs it was let us say - I a ill take it at random - in 1650, and a map of •what it is at the present time, he v ould have ocular demonstration 0 f the fact.

However it really turns u &gt;on this- That argument turns upon s icno lodjo of Indian feoling, o^trat which I m/rovy poor &amp;utharity, I ;olievo, hos’ovor,. the.t it is true that you could loavo tho Turk in Buro?o end co ad leevo bin in possession of Oonstnntinonlo , and yet preserve the waterways of 'one Dcrdanellos end tha Bosphorus, end I do not think that it would re.pairo very le-rgo o ors to do so, or cny grout force or any gras, cost of money.

Those are difficulties which it is er-sp to state ::nd not edsy to solve. If I c nild see a solution to them I should ay self go in for doing w:.-t I thin l lord Curzon -El-desires to do, and what certainly Sir Eyre Crowe desires to dn, i s whi civ's ending the Turks back to their native highlands, and of course neutralising the Straits, and handing over that particular pa*t cf tne country which y:u cannot gi&amp;ke over to Greece or to Bulgaria into the hands of some mandatory power'which can only be* as far as I can see, America. LOfu) ROBERT CECIL: I reoo.,nize the enormous difficulties ♦ cf any settlement cf this (juestion. .^r Balfour has stated them America it with ^reat power as far as/is concerned. M^y % not be said that the difficulties he has pointed out will exist whatever you rather 'do, even if you leave the Turk there? I hav^/roluctantly come round to the view which I did not hold at first, that it would probably be better to get rid of the Turk altogether. Just think what you would have if you left the Turks there. You would have the Fulton there with a very much shorn empire in Asia. Ycu would have the Powers in control of the Straits and necess arily very much in evidence thre. Somebody would have to be there. I do not know whether it would be a mandatory power or whether it would be m international power. In any case, you would h've them all round there. They would be going in and out of Constantinpple. You would have the fact that at one period cf the wa* we h .d definitely promised that Constanti nople should be occupied by the Russians, and that as late as the beginning of 1917 we had laid it down as part of cur terms that Turney should be turned out of Europe altogetner, and it seems to :.e quite incredible in those circumstances the Sultan should be in anything but a very 'dicky” position. Then, you would hive surrounding him the Greeks, who are passionately anxious to have Constantinople, and the Bulgarians, who are r . equally passion tely desirous of having it, and if the Russians ever revive, the Russians v/i 11 be equally passionately anxious to have it. I think the atmosphere of intrigue would be pro- .,i,:,ious, and to have Turkey there in the centre in just the situation they have always lived in and always enjoyed and always made capital out of wh n they were playing one set of Powers against the other, would be a very serious matter I think - 22 -Therp would ’bp immediately a party formed. $&lt;m&lt;t W^Ml. back the Greekg, and so.ae the Bulgarians, and some the Rueeiane^ and you would have the Turks enjoying it in the middle and creating trouble as they always have created trouble between the '.Vestern Powers by that means. That seems to me to be a powerful argument. Indeed, if I may say so, it is exactly Mr Balfour’s argument which has driven me to the conclusion opposite to th,t stt which he has arrived. I quite agree that whatever you do, the situation cannot be very tolerable. I admit that if the alternative is an International occupation of Constantinople with a Frenchman in one position and an Englishman in another, and an Italian in another, I rather incline to think that I should prefer to leave the Turks there. But if you can put the Americans in (I do not see anybody else that could possibly be put in) then on the whole I believe that that would be the position which is most likely to be permanent. Mind, 1 quite agree with Mr Balfour; I think that the difficulties of getting the Americans to go there are enormous. Unle^ you can cut off practically the whole of the territory and give it to the Greeks, leaving a very small hinterland to Constant: nople, I do not believe MR BALFOUR: The Chatalja line. SIR ROBERT CECIL; That kind of thing. THE Cii/LIR. iAN : To whom would you give Advianople? MR BALFOUR: Bu1gav&gt; a• SIR ROBERT Cl^CIL: You might give it tc Bulgaria, I quite agree that it is most desirable that we should if possible fall in with the views of the G-re ko, one berbiu—s «.no. unc, Roumanians, if they have agreed on some settlement, unless it is grossly unfair tc Bulgaria. X do not thumc u/iao Bulgaria has the slightest claim on us from any point of view. If that is possible I should be ratner inclined to see that done. May I say just one word about the Admiralty point about the Americans? Of course, the Americans would only go there an the nandatcry of the League of Larions or wnatever you ope an author i ty.. M -I lR '• j - like to I do not myself see on\ , ? - 24 •• - V (&amp;9 V what ground they should wish to have a fl*ot in thi» Hffdit erranean; but I think that have to make up our minds definitely what attitude we are going to take up with regard to the Americans. If we are going tc reg rd any increase in American power ae a danger to this country, then I confess I do not see any fcope whatever of arriving at a durable settlement under the Treaty of Peaoe, I think that re must take up the position that, admitting that nothing is certain in the future, the chance of our having to fight the Ameri cans is so remote th t it may be neglected, and that we must con sider th t a growth of American power is not a threat to us at all. but on the contrary is ratner a bulwark to our safety than a treat to our safety. Therefore I am not in the least afraid personally of any increase of American power if it were to take place, I per sonally think it extremely unlikely that the Americans would ever consent to keep any very large naval feroe in the Eastern Xediterran ean because they were the mandatories of the Powers for a little tiny district including Constanti nople. As to the Auhaninedans, I do not feel in an immense difficulty, because the authorities are so conflicting. I do not pretend to have an opinion myself. I observe that Sir A.Hirtxel does not appear quite to see eye to eye with Sir Hamilton Grant, nor does Lord Curzon see eye to eye with Hr Montagu. Therefore I think that I may say that on the whole I do net think that I should regard that ae a danger which I must ccnsidex. HE MOHTAGU: Your solution remaps to leave the Turks there unless the Americans will take it? SIR ROBERT CECIL: Ye a. I think that the danger of attempting to carry out the international government even of a oomparauively small district there would be greater on the whole than leaving the Turk there. ADMIRAL HOPE: I think that the view the Admiralty take is this - that the size of the Davy determines the policy of the noun*- try very largely, and the more commitments America gets outside the United States, or you may say outride the continent of America, the more inducement to her to increase her fleet. Up to a certs 2 r limit it is all right; but if she goes beyond that limit it will 1 *fo^ce u« to lncr, a , e the Mzo of our fleet. So. it ie deeirable froffl our point of V4fe--, not to encourage the yimerioiine to undertake comciitmento outeide their o-vn ccntiaent. There ie no douht that if the -aricine go to Paleetine and Turkey, tney will maintain a hig squadron in the .mediterranean, and that will he a considerable embarrassment to us in the future. THr C ^ IIRUAH; If the y ’ ven t to Constantinople in the kind of capacity that has been suggested namely in order to exercise police powers, why should they require to strengthen their Havy? AMORAL HOPB: There is no particular reason why they should, but, k ho wing the Air.erioa.ns, I think that they would, THT, Ciiwilio.vAR: What would they have to do with their Navy? AIUI&amp;AL HOPS: They would be possibly in Caucasia as well. THE Chair:L kN: We are dealing for the moment with the question of Constantinople, ju^t as Yre dealt the other day in the Cabinet ivath the question of Palestine, I could not see then why, if they were placed in charge of Lerusalesa they must have a fleet in the Mediterranean to enable then to do sc. ADMIRAL HOPE: I think that they will, I do not say that there is any reason. They had the very slightest interest possible in Beyrut in Syria., but they kept ships there. I say that it would be a considerable embarrassment to us if they did have a big squadron there. With regard to the Straits themselves, the proposition of the Admiralty is that the waterways should be administered by mach inery similar to the Danube Commission. That has really the administration of the waterways, the lights, pilots, the pro vision of marks, regulations for the ships passing, the payment of dues as they cone along. They would hsve absolutely no jurisdiction ashore, provided that the forts and fortifications have been destroyed. If they have been destroyed, and there are no guns on the bunks of the DarcbhbLlda and the 'phosphorous, the Dardanelles and Sosphercus Commission need not have the slightest administrative work on shore, -Sa x'mw B&amp;mfce eommiBsion Hert c-dininietration : Supposing that the gunc and the fortifica tions are destroyed, there; is no need for anything beyond a small force. MH - BALFOUR: We should refuse to allow Turkey to have a Navy. ADIVIRAL HOPE: That is assumed, THE CHAIRMAN: I have never heard the as sumption explicit ly stated before# X think it ought to be assumed* ADMIRAL HOPE: If the Turks were turned cut of Constanti- as much influence on the waterways as Constantinople has* You must push the Turk out of Chanak too• Supposing that after the Crimean war or the war of 1868 we had insisted on the demolition oi the forts and the freedom of the waterways throurh the Dardenelles and the Bosphorous the whole influence of the Turks would probably have died out. THE CHAIRMAN: If the Turks were turned out, and the fer ts were demolished, it would equally apply to the southern side of the Straits as the northern. ADMIRAL HOPS: Yes. THE CHAIRMAN: Thy, then,, need you turn him. out of Chanak? ADMIRAL HOPE: The argument, was that if he remained at Constantinople, he wouie still have some political effect over the European rovers in the administration of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorous. THE CHAIRMAN: No, the argument was that he would be able to resume his old game of intrigue. SIR ROBERT CECIL: The prestige of Constantinople is the real thing. ALMIRAL HOPE: Provided that there are no fortifications and that the administration of the waterways is in International nople they would still have the south shore. Chanak has just27 EM (&amp;£) hands, it really does not matter. MR. BALFOUR: May I ask ^ne military question? This is a purely military or naval question. I remember s discussion - X was at the Admiralty in fact at the time when much if it was going on - whether you could force the Dardenelles and how you could force them, and I rather came to the conclusion that you could make the place almost intolerable for passenger ships without having any forts at all, by having heavy howitzers right back from the shore, four or five miles back from the shore, right in the middle of ' the Constantinople&gt; In the old days the forts wercythings; but you can make it very difficult now without forts. X can quite imagine that if the Turks have actu 1 control of Constantinople and oi the unfortified lands on each side of the josphorous and of the Dardenelles, they could put, inland, batteries of a very temoorary kind if they had the guns somewhere about, and could have places marked and have everything ready and could mane the px&amp;ce almost impassable, end then if they had stored mines and torpedoes they could make the thing very difficult, although every permanent fortification were removed. I do not know whether that po^n.. of view has any military or naval force at uxl; but I should ^ much like to hear what the soldiers say about uiat, GRIFRAL TH'RAITES: The question of the use of howitzers has been very freely demonstrated in this war. You can use a howitzer in exactly the same way as you can use a gun. aou can P-^ behind a wall. But in every case of the use of artillery y-a must, be able to see from some point of view or other thu cojcco bh&lt;~.t j ou &amp;r6 going to fare at. Therefore you must have a position of Observation; and a]though you may be able to put your howitzers well back; you must have positions from which your artillery officers must able to see the object. The persons controlling the fire will have to be sitting somewhere very close to the was- erway to be able to see the ships. KR. BALFOUR: They will. I suppose that there is nothing difficult in that; is there? 4 . u ,, T - &lt;..* 1*1 iie-ncl communications . nr. pp.RAL TIL AITES: You must hav«s &amp;fl uno UwU.-x •LOiiD IiOriliT CECIL: If you 9 re cclng to hrve batteries put back for the defence of this waterway, you would probably have In stalled telephone arrangements and all these things beforehand. THE CHAIRMANS Would not that point be met by some- arrangement by which, the forts being knocked down and the Straits internation alised, the Turks, whether they were on the northern shore or the southern shore or on both, would have to submit to certain condi tions as regards a zone of territory, say five, six, seven, or eight miles from the sea on both sides, which would be liable to examine- tion, £• nd so on? LCn! ROBekT CECIL: You would have to have some kind of interna- tional force to wftch this. MR. BALFOUR: Yes, on both sides of the Sea of Marmora and both sides of Gallipoli, and both sides of the Straits, x think that it has been marked out. THE CHAIRMAM: Yes, on one of the mapo. SIR EYRE CROYE: There is a suggestion that the Turks should be asked to have no armed force. GENERAL MACLCkOGH: Just before coming over here I had a talk with General Milne who is ever here on leave. He had not seen any of ihe papers at all j but he toj.d me that he thought that the very worst possible solution of the problems would be to establish any kind of international condominium in Constantinople. Ke said that the intrigue that that would give rise to would be absolutely appalling. Ke said thtt he considered that the next worse solution would be to hand over the place to the Greeks. He said that he had seen a great deal of the Greeks during the threc-and-a-half years he had been in Salonica, and they were absolutely rotten, and the Government was worse even than that of Turkey. Ho considered that the second worse wry of dealing with the matter. The way which he would prefer himself would have been if Great Britain could have been given a mandate to rule Constantinople for the Turk.. I told him that we could not paint the whole,map red, and therefore that must be ruled out. His opinion was much the same as Lord Robert Cecil's that if you could not get America to go there as a mandatory OO — k- . V ) —29 power the beet solution would be to keep the Turk there et present. SIR LOUIS MALLET: The solution I would like would be to turn the Turk out; but I sec great difficulty about it. THE CHAIRMAN: What does Sir Eyre Crowe say about It? SIR EYRE CHORE: I take the point of my Memorandum that there was a general agreement that the American solution was the best., but failing the American solution internationalisation of some sort is inevitable. The Admiralty has referred to the analogy of the Danube com mission, which I have myself also quoted. Admiral Hope will pro bably know that the fact that Gslatz is a Roumanian town has very much hampered the work of the Commission, It is one of the difficulties with which they have to deal that the seat of the._r activities Is a foreign town. From that point, of view any Oom- mission which would be established would function bettor n the town was under their own control. I therefore would borrow the analogy of the Panama Canal. Tno Americans control Panama, and the Americans also in tiio Canal zone con^x’ox cno shores L ..^e .inside waters. The Americans if they exorcise police fuiotxmio would certainly exercise water police functions over the harboms and quays in all the ports in the Marmora. There would be no dif ficulty about that. We have been drawing up in the Foreign Offi.oc in some detail a scheme to give effect to the American Commission, We do not believe that we can give all the powers to the Americans there which they hove in Panama; but I think that it would be essential to them to hold the City oi Constantin ople. You would have a Turkish Commissioner in the Commission who would have to be in close touch with the American Government. The influence of that Commissioner would be a thing mat would effect the working. Everybody would run alter hj.m c-nd or/ to set something out of him. Tho argument we have heard about Muhammedan feeling in Indiais subject to this; if it is the ers© v?e must bo very very ccreful indeed in dealing with the Sulten not to do anything to him on account of huhammadan feeling, the deduction I draw from thet is that ae perpetuate difficulties in dealing v'-ith the bultan, because every tine -ve want to do something we have to face the difficulty of dealing Fith ; uhn •rnadan feeling. If we once cut the Gordian knot and gat, rid of the lurk —•« THE GK'IiVi- .H; Supposing that the Americans or some other form of r dministrs tion ■■■ 'ere set up in Constantinople, how would you deal with the hinterland? SIR EYRE CRO E: The only hinterland which at the present \ time' I believe is In question is west of the line nnos-MAifa This is the only territory, end this bit of Thrice. I think that everybody is agreed that that is all that is going to be left to Turkey under any schcrae. That territory is largely inhabited by Greeks. The principal ports of it are Greek. Redos to is Greek. '• ith all due respect to General hilne I entirely disagree with inn when he says that the Government of Greece is worse than that of Turkey* It is by no means perfect; but it is a travesty to compare 5.t with that of Turkey. The Greeks do keep order. They have a thriving population* They carry on legitimate trades on perfectly civilised lines, and they are very veil able to hold their o n,- It is quite possible that they o oppress foreign populations. All the Balkan people do that* I believe tint the Turkish element in this bit of Thrace would clear out. As Lord Curz.on pointed out if the Sultan goes to Brusr or Ron!a, I think most of those Turks will clear out, just as L/ J. X O clear-..d out of Crete. I think that the Armenians would clear out.

Constantinople, in which term is included the Straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, derives its strategic importance from its dual capacity of (a) a land bridge and, (b) a sea passage. In its former capacity it will always provide, as it has in the past, a route for waves of invasion between Europe and Asia. In its latter capacity it gives access to the main door of Russia and to an important line of advance on India. 2. To realize the above it is merely necessary to make a cursory examination of history. On the collapse of the Byzantine Empire the resultant wave of invasion carried the Turks across the causeway of Constantinople to the gates of Vienna, as well as into Southern Russia as far as Poland and Tzaritsin. The subsequent decline of the Turkish Empire produced a gradually increasing vacuum in the Near East, dammed by the Balkan bridgehead. This may now be said to be complete, owing to the final collapse of Turkey in the present war as a Great Power. There have been two notable attempts to fill this vacuum whilst in process of formation : (a) The Russian tide, the first appearance of which was the advance on the Black Sea inaugurated by Peter the Great. This was seriously penetrating the Turkish Empire until it was brought to a standstill by (b) The Germanic tide, the set of which is marked by the action of Bismarck and Lord Beaconsfield when they secured the amendment of the treaty of San Stefano by that of Berlin. 3. The ebb of Turkey and the combined pressure of these rival Germanic and Russian efforts forced into being the block of Balkan States which in 1914 represented the western bridgehead of Constantinople, and it was, at least partly, the Germanic assault on Serbia which caused the present war. 4. The above historical sketch shows sufficiently the importance of Constantinople as a land communication between Europe and Asia. o It has been mentioned that the original Turkish invasion, after reaching the Bosphorus, crossed the Black Sea into Southern Russia, and when the Russian tide first set towards the Black Sea the action of Peter the Great in the formation of the Russian Navy brings into historical prominence the importance of Constantinople as a sea passage. Of this the importance has also been accentuated in the present war by the Dardanelles campaign. The failure to open the Straits may be said to have been one of the main causes for the present state of Russia. Had the other Entente powers been able to maintain communication with Russia through the Black Sea it is probable that there would have been no collapse of Russia and that she would now be a great organized power in being. 5. Though the above two attempted invasions of Asia Minor by the land and sea passage through Constantinople have failed, the law of the vacuum is inexorable, and unless the autochthonous states of Arabia, Armenia and Trans-Caucasia can satisfy this vacuum, we must face an inevitable flow of invasion from Europe into Asia Minor. What form this invasion will take it is early to prophesy, but the Germanic population of Europe still numbers 90,000,000, French ambitions have been re-awakened, and above all, a powerful and ambitious Slavic State in the name of Greater Serbia is being formed. Perhaps we have the most to fear from the last named for it does not seem that Bulgaria alone will be able to stand between this State and Constantinople, and the present policy of Italy tends to alienate Greater Serbia from the Entente. At the same time the inability of the Entente to give practical help to Russia during the war and since the revolution may well result in an anti- Entente orientation of Russian policy in the future.. Therefore, from the broadest point of view the importance of Constantinople to an Empire such as ourselves, with great interests in the East, is clear, and it is there that any future naval expansion based on a reconstructed Russia must be tnrottled. (B18/502) 150 12/18 H&amp;S 6690woM'-lf' t ■ lijtic’r 1 -,! | li ,1 6 . Admitting this argument, it remains to be examined what method of holding the gate we can accept as providing sufficient security. Should Turkey be dispossessed, candidates to be considered m g (a.) Greece, (b.) The United States or (c.) Ourselves. /„ \ It wou ld no t be desirable to allow Greece to occupy Constantinople even “ :rL - ““ “tSTdta'SpS 1 '4 23S - «” p ' would probably meet with too much opposition for it to be a Poetical propo • The candidature of France and Italy have not been considered sm^ they are as undesirable as America from the naval point of view, from which it is essential that Constantinople and the Straits should be held by a weak naval power. 7 The Admiralty would prefer to see the Straits internationalized with free mssane for ships of all descriptions, all forts and other defences completely destroyed and a commission similar to the Danube Commission to administer the waterways. Thus Turkey might be left in possession under international guarantees. s - This solution would be acceptable to the General Staff provided the Straits remained untunnelled and unbridged, and that a Turkey friendly ^ om^lve 8 was ensured. In this connection it has already been suggested that we “ ^ e . ov £ and administer the country. The invitation is under investigation but should it be politically desirable, its acceptance wo.dd be militarily advantageous, tor , surest guardians of our own interests and a predominant position at Constantinople would place under our control a ready-made Turkish garrison to bar the road to * East. This would be an important consideration m relation to post-war uarrisons overseas. 8. So far Constantinople only has been considered as a crossing into Asia Minor,*but it must always be remembered that there is another route across the Caucasus. If we can ensure the security of Constantinople as well as t hat of the Caucasus against any prospect of invasion, we shall have only the Orenburg-Tashkent line to fear leading towards India, and we shall be strategically satisfied from the military point of view tor such time as we can now see into the future. 9. The conclusion is that our naval and military interests will best be served if Turkey remains in possession of Constantinople and the Straits, but that the sea passage must be internationalized, and we must close with any offer made by the Turks for our tutelage over themselves, so as to obtain a benevolent buffer State controlled by us between Europe and our Eastern possessions. 1:4 1 General Staff, War Office, 22nd December, 191S.

In Constantinople itself the proportion of the population is estimated as follows:- Turks o85,000* Greeks 153,000, Arrne nians 150 5 OCX) * Foreign subjects 129,000, Jews 44 r 000* Others 13, OCX), In the country districts the statistics at present available., date from before the Balkan wars, and take no account of the considerable deportations end massacres carried out from 1913-1913. It may be assumed, however, that the population is pie— 8ominantly Turkish, with Greek majorities on the coast, and Bulgarian minorities at Adrianople and Krikilisseg 2. As early as liarch 1915, His Maj esty 1 s Government broke with their traditional Eastern policy by asse ting to the incorporation within the Russian Empire0 ) Empire of the city of Constantinople, and of a zone comprising former Turkey in kurop-e south-eamt of the jinos-Midia line, with a corresponding Asiatic zone from the mouth of River Dakaria to the Gulf of Ismid. This undertaking lapsed in 1917 with the repudiation hy the Russian Revolutionary Government of the treaties entered into hy their predecessors, and the policy of His Majesty’s Government was there after based -on the assumption that the only alternative to Russian annexation was the maintenance of Turkish sovereignty, subject to the safeguards necessary for the freedom of the Straits* It was on. tnis assumption that our public statements, which had previously been to the effect that the. Turks would be expelled from Europe, were modified so as to provide for the continuance of Ottoman sovereignty*, (cf. Allied reply to President Wilson of the 10th January, 1917, 'vne turning oat of Europe of the Ottoman Empire as decidedly j- oreign to Western civilisation” with Mr. Lloyd George’s speech o_ the 5th January, 1913, 4 we are not fighting to deprive Turkey of its capital') * a The irmue of the present war and the complete capitulation of Turkey have, however, aomewliat, unexpected! ayain provided us with a carte 'blanche on which to raroda our future hasten policy and it is uned amt tine reuse covering our previous assurption, tnot tne Turk Should remain(3) .ven c,fo s s remain In Europe, are no longer in force, regards President \7ilson ! s fourteen points we are not. eound Py specific obligation, .in ttot tlie President merely stated (Point Xil) tliat ”Tlie Tur.visn portions of the present Ottoman Empire should oe assured a secure sovereignty H , conditional on a guarantee of the interests of the subject nationalities aad of the freedom of the Straits 0 ^ 4 - Iie main issues, from our point of view, are: (1) the problem of providing for the future occupancy and administration of the Straits district and Constantinople, and 'C, two passible affect cf our ' decision upon Jbcslan , .5* As rwyards the latter pr'blem, it is pr .oabl e tnat tile ^j ectiell jZ the Sultan f rmri Constantinople may be made the pretext for agitation °y active sections of Moslem opinion* On the other nand, it would, once for all, put an end to the legend of Turkish military prowess, which has for so long been the mainspring of Pan-Islamic propaganda, a.id would encourage iioslems to seek elsewhere for the figure-head of tneir religion^ dUu tnere can be little doubt that thin latter current Oj. opinion wouic. overwhelm the former, ad uixc-Lu x-oslem mentality would be more impressed by a s categorical■■■■ ( 4 ), categorical anti-Turkinii i: sue then it would be pl ac at e d by a poll cy of t ernp or i a at i on and c omp r cmi b e Wit tout here ante n*»-.r.-v.i-.rc info full (:.i BCllI!'Bi O.U 01 tllO re^t£ cm ' n't' o “n - J. ettv U G... of the nro-Turhirh movement among partieo of Indian I.oBlema and the real extern of it a i;. if 1 u e:i c e ( it may b e ur^e&lt;l w it n r- ame c onf id en c e that the balance of advantage inclines strongly in tv our of the ejection of the Burk from Europe, 6 The f ture disposal of Constantinople no doubt presents dipl omatic and inteniaafionsl difficult ies 0 These v:ill however arise in seme form or other whatever dfCision is lltfeva.s to re&amp;tinitt^ Ottoman sovereignty since even if the Turk were to remain, some powerii external authority must be instituted to safeguard the freedom of the StraiitSo 7. The ejection of Turkey from Europe would involve the administration of Constantinople and the Straits by either a .g r# eat Power, a minor Power or some iniemation; 1 boaly, Althouadi European opinion mi4ht have been prep, re at one time to accept the occupation ox Constantinople ■fey,- Russia, yet it is doubtful wnether e'e^j otne r ire am Power would now be accepted in lieu of Russia* Among the smaller Powers,Greece ana.

It is, moreover, not in our interests that so vital a point as Constan tinople should be left in the hands oi a weak Power. . 3. There are obvious objections to placing the administration oi Constantinople and the Straits unuer a condominium oi the Great Powers somewhat ion the model of the Danube Commission, and although such a solution may possibly be hound in the end the only practical one attainable., it is so far from ideal that no effort should be spared to find an alternative* Such an alternative would consist in an arrangement under which international guarantee would be combined with one-Powcr administration f and the League oi NationshiTould nominate a mandatory Power having full authority over Constantinople and the Straits® The power most suitable for exercising tnis iunction is the United States of America. 9. It is common ground that, whether Turkey ceases to possess any territory in Europe or whether she retains her ancient capital with a more or less substantial hinterland, the jport of Constantinople and the navigation of ITie Straits, including the Sea of Marmora as well as the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, shall be placed under foreign control o * 3 ■■■ naMOManpB^ control •• ABBuming tn^t bucIi control iiiubu 'be v qs either in the Uniteo Stetee or, io.llinhj them, in an Int e mat i onal C-or.T/iiiSBion, the boo it ion ox tnie con.u roll into authority will he mat emore diificalt ii the Sultan retains jurisdiction over a European territory than ii he is relerateu to Asia altogether, 10.

It has often been the sin of peace nogctiatSon-a- to perpetuate old disputes and troubles-ov;ing to lack of insight into the causes of such disturbances. It is earnestly to be hoped that tliis reproach will not in future bo made against the Powers -who are about to settle the affairs of the -world by the peace of Paris. It would be like the perpetuation of the quarrels between England end Prance over the Newfoundland fisheries., which was due to the persistent noglecu of the British negctlat-^em 1 to insist on a radical settlement of that dispute when concluding the successive treaties of peace between 1714 and 1815, Tills lesson should not remain forgotten. 12n It rcains to consider the succession tc the sovereignty over the territories which would otherwise be left with Turkey in Europe, It is already generally agreed that in no case viculd those territories caiotej-dr hcst Of the Enos kidia line.

The task of the Great Powers in dealing with the Balkan situation will he much facilitated if they can see their way to accept vdiat Greece, Bervla, or Houmania are agreed upon. Tnmre is n tills case the furtlier advantage tliat Greece-^, as Ivionsiour ^enizclos lias made kncvai confidontj • nv would be prepared, if Her claims in Thrace are allowed, cease urging her p.:' ;tensions in the Smyrna district. It would he difficult to overestimate the value oo us of a free hand as to Smyrna sc long as we remain under the shadow of our agreement with Italy of 1917 respecting Asia Minor, l^h Apart from this, it may be said that the landing ever of Gallipoli and Eastern Thrace to Greece is an arrangement which can be recommended on its merits, ihcre is a large, probably a preponderating, Greek population^ I\idosto and the Is lends of the Marmora are certainly purely Greek.

The opinion of the Admiralty in regard to the Dardanelles and Bosphorus can be surmarised as follows (1) Free passage- between the Mediterranean and the Blaoh Sea should be secured to Ships of all descriptions (both merchant ships and Men of War) under international guarantee. (2) All forts and other defences shou3.d be completely destroyed. (o) The administration, e.g. lighting and buoyage, of the waterways of the Dardanelles, Sea of Marmora and Bosphorus should be in the hands of a Commission drawn up on the same lines as the Danube Commission. If these requirements are met, it is evident that Constantinople should not be in the hands of any strong Power- Provided that this is insisted on, the Admiralty are not otherwise directly concerned with the future administration of Constantinople.

Hr.FRY /ILSOl: said that with the defeat of Bulgaria the mission r&gt;f General Franchet d^isperey’s army had been completed. General Franchet d’Esperey then moved Northwards towards the Danube. But with the fall of the Turkish p.ower, the British had been anxious to move Fastv/ard in order to join han' s with the Palestine and Mesopotamian ExpeGitionary Forces. From a purely soldier 1 s point of view he would, like to see General nilne taken away from General Franchet d^Esperey^ command for the reason that G-eneral Filne was also in command of the Caucasus expedition. It had been found impossible to undertake the occupation of the Caucasus and Batum with detachments from General marshal’s forces; whereas it was eas^ to get to Batum from the European side* Moreover, a portion cf General Milne’s forces were available for this purpose. MR. LLOYD GL0RGE said that this proposal affected General Milne’s command at Constantinople, and it agreement would involve a departure from an i. •' ^ which he had made 'ith k. Clemenceau in 3 aris. If the proposals made by General r/ilson related to the Caucasus only, he would agree that a separate command should be formed. LJRD MILNER saw no reason why there should be any difference as far as the troops in Turkey were concerned. These could remain under General Franchet d’Esperey. But the operations in the Caucasus t© be undertaken by General Milne’s troops should be quite independent. All that was required, was that General Milne should have an independent command in the Caucasus, whilst remaining under General Pranchet d’Esperey in European territories. MR. LLOYD GEORGE expressed the view that complicati«ns would arise if General Milne were under General Franchet d’Esperey’s command for #peraticns in Turkey and independent -8- f or* V for operations in the Caucasus, OEKEHAL SIK •/XLSOK drew attention to the fact I ^ that certain of the divisions included in General kllne’s forces, were not now wanted i- Turkey* For instance, •ne division 4n the Danube and another at Salonika, The mission allotted to these farces had been tc beat Bulgaria, and since this work had been completed, he asked to be permitted to withdraw them from General Franchet d*B-sperey , s command, as troops were wanted in the Caucasus. Garrisson troops would be left for Gallipoli, Constantinople, etc., and these would remain under the orders of General Franchet dhEsperey, LORD IvilLi'JER supported General Wilson’s proposal. He , fully agreed, that at Constantinople there would be British troops under a British General under General Franchet d’Esperey’s orders. But there 'were other troops which they wanted to withdraw from Turkey and to send to the Caucasus.

As soon as the Allied troops got into Germany, some decision would have to be reached regarding the management of telephones, telegraphs, press censorship, 9--10 f censorship, rally/ay arrangements, etc. In a word, sneaking generally, It would be necessary to draw up certain rules that would govern the relations between the troops and the inhabitants. No doubt such regulations had already been drawn up by marshal Foch. But -ho wished to enquire whether the French regulations would apply to the British Array Occupation. .-.AESHAL FOCH said that the general principles which would govern these questions had already been communicated to.the Allied Commanders-in-Chief and General deygand would be able to explain these principles in greater detail to the C onference. Gj-NLEAL G'YGaHD said that for the civil administration of the whole of the occupied territories, general principles had been laid down in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Conventions* Rouglily speaking, the local civil authorities would continue to function under the control of the Allied military authorities. In order to make certain uniform that this control was being exercised in a ‘ ' manner, the responsible military authorities would receive general directions from the Commander-In-Chief of the Allied Forces. In addition, each Ilitary authority would have a civil controller; and these v/ould meet weekly to co-ordinate develop it along similar lines. As regards the work and to ' railways, an Inter-Allied Commission had been appointed, and another I n ter~Allied Commission had been appointed for the control of the telegraphs and telephones. GENERAL FIR HENRY .ILSOF thanked General Weygand for his statement, with which he was entirely satisfied. CONSTANT' FI NOBLE. NR. BALFOUR said that he thought he was correct in saying that It Was not suggested that they should come even to a preliminary decision on this question. They simply wished to clear their minds. The question was full of difficulties.Bulgarians would never forgive the Allies if they were not the might resent such an arrangement. If it were decided that Constantinople must remain Turkish, Turkish power must not be allowed to remain there. If the Straits were going to be kept open both in peace and in war time, their custody could not to introduce another ^ower, something not Turkish, and this other Power would have to be above the Turks and controlling the Turks. Such a solution introduced very great difficulties. But something of the kind must be done. A weak European Power might be asked to do this. For Instance,, Bulgaria. Or a strong Power such as America. He doubted whether America would agree. But he was entitled to ask whether America had of the responsibilities facing Europe. These were the two kinds of alternatives. Neither were attractive and both were / ' r full of difficulties. He himself was against giving Const antinople to any other Power, but he was equally against leaving any power for evil to the Turks. Therefore it was essential to give this power to a Neutral, and in that* position he would rather see a strong Neutral. He had stated the problem without attempting to solve it, though he had made one suggestion for what it was worth. M CLEkENCEAU said that he would not object to America, but ho woulf be extremely surprised if America accepted. It would be accepting responsibility, without any advantages. EE. LLOYD CEORGE said that another suggestion had been made to him, namely, to leave the Turks there but to appoint an International Controller or Resident; something analogous to i selected occupants. Italy might not vreleone the presence of Greeks there. And ever Russia, when it came to its own. be trusted to the Turks. Therefore, it would be necessary &amp; U-an a British Resident of Indian Native State. Or even like Lord Cromer in Egyot, h, CLEMENCEAU enquired to what nation the Resident would belong-. Mi, LLOYD GEORGE replied that this would have to be decided by agreement. For instance, the League of Nations 'would appoint the Resident. h. CLIkENCEAb remarked that in that case it would be necessary, in addition^, for an international army and fleet to be placed under his orders. iv.R. BALI OUR agreed and said that he did not think this need cause any very great difficulty. PATE OP LE. BALFOUR asked permission to put a oractical MEETING OF THE PEACE question. He wished to know what had been settled about CONFERENCE. the date on which work was to be begun in Paris In connection Yirith the Peace Conference. Ivi* CLEkENCEAU replied that nothing definite could be settled until hr. Wilson had been consulted, but that in the meanwhile enquiries could be addressed to Colonel House, PAYMENT OF MARSHAL POOR said that in thw German territories to be COSTS OF THE ARi'.;Y OF occupied by th Allh d troops, th cost of the maintenance of OCCUPATION. the troops was to be borne by Germany in accordance with the terms of the armistice.. But as the requirements of the different Armies were very different, different pay, diff erent scales of rations, etc., the preparation of the accounts would become extremely complicated. The Germans would un doubtedly ask for some uniform method of calculating the charges to be made.. Ho wished to propose that each Govern- ment should fix a definite figure as a basis for calculating the total charges Incurred. Otherwise the Germans would be lost in the tangle of varied demands put forward. His -12- proposal ,proposal, therefore, was that the Italian, British, American and Belgian Governments should each appoint representatives to a Commission -vhose duty it would btj, after enquiry, to establish a uniform scale, or tariff of charges to simplify accounts, hn. LLOYD GI ORGE enquired whether they really wished to do thio. In his opinion, each Army would prepare its own accounts and send them in, provided they did not charge more than the .actual cost incurred. American and Colonial troops were highly paid. Were the Germans to be let off making payment for expend iture which had actually been incurred by the Allies, merely in order to simplify account-keeping? He thought that such a proposal would require very careful consideration and he suggested that further consideration should be postponed to a later date.

I am desired to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have decided shortly to publish an agreement concluded between the British and Russian Governments regarding the Straits and Constantinople. This agreement was made in March 1915, and it provides that the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora, Constantinople, Southern Thrace, up to the Enos Midia line, with Tenedos and Imbros and part of the Asiatic coast between the Bosphorus and the river Sakharia, and a point to be fixed on in the Gulf of Ismid, should be incorporated in the Russian Empire, subject to the satisfactory conclusion of the war and the realisation of the desiderata of Erance and Great Britain. His Majesty’s Government propose to publish simultaneously with the agreement a note a A ■ r of His Excellency the Governor in Council the information Honour the Lieutemvnt-uovtrnoi m loaueu. of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor. COpy Of which IS enclosed for — - - - your information. 2 The Government of India fully realise that the publication at the present iuncture of an announcement of the intended dismemberment of Turkey is not unlikely to create a very profound sensation among the Moslem com- munity of India and in Afghanistan and have represented their views fully to His Majesty’s Government. There are, however, strong international arguments in favour of the immediate publication of this announcement. Eor one thing it is desirable to lay to rest once and for all, the suspicions with which British policy is still regarded in certain Russian circles ; lor another the Russian Government feel they could hardly publish their mteoded manifesto regarding Poland, the publication of which cannot for military reasons be postponed much longer, without letting the Russian people know that their own aspirations with regard to Constantinople are also to be satisfied at the end of the war. 3. In order to minimise the effect of the announcement in India and Afghanistan, the Government of India lune recommended to the Secretary of State that no official communique on the subject should be published in2 India and that all references to the announcement in Reuter’s and other news telegrams should be suppressed. For experience has shown that news which merely filters into India in letters and newspapers by mail attracts much less attention, is robbed of much of its sensational effect and serves gradually to accustom public opinion to disturbing pronouncements. 4. I shall inform you by telegram whether His Majesty’s Government approve the course indicated in the last paragraph and also the probable date of the publication as soon as it is settled. The reception accorded to the news when it actually reaches India will have to be carefully watched. The passing of objectionable resolutions and any form of hostile demonstration cannot, of course, be tolerated, and I am to request that, in order to obviate such contingencies when the time comes, selected officers may be instructed to explain the situation tactfully but firmly to leading Moslems and the heads of Moslem associations. The note accompanying the announcement will, it is hoped, assist them materially in their conversations. NOTE. The action of the Turkish Government at the beginning of the war in providing refuge for the German ships “ Goeben ” and “ Breslau ” made it clear to the Allied Powers that there were misguided influences at Constanti nople which, blinded by a false appreciation of the strength of the Central Powers, would drag Turkey into the war on the side of Germany, and thereby themselves deal the final blow to the Turkish Empire, whose welfare the Allies had so long and so unweariedly laboured to promote. In spite of the equivocal attitude assumed from the first by the Turkish Government, the Allies made every effort to induce the Sublime Porte to hold aloof from the struggle, participation in which could only mean for Turkey the immediate selling herself into bondage to Germany and the ultimate disintegration of her Empire, which it had long been foreseen would occur as soon as Turkey took part in, or became the scene of, a movement of world forces such as is the present war. The Allies did not ask Turkey to take part in the war on their side : they only asked that she should remain neutral in her own interests, and they gave her the most solemn assurances and guarantees that in this case her territorial integrity and her independence would be left untouched. A guarantee of integrity and independence was offered to Turkey : neutrality was all that the Allies asked of her. None the less, in the early morning of the 29th October 1914, a treacher ous and unprovoked attack was made without warning by ships of war under the Turkish flag on the vessels and harbours of a neighbouring Power, with whom Turkey was then at peace. Russia, who had suffered this unprecedent ed violation of the most ordinary rules of international law and usage, had no course left but to make the only reply to a Power capable of committing such acts, namely, to treat her as an enemy ; and the Allies of Russia, who had in the past upheld Ottoman sovereignty and who in this war had done their utmost to save Turkey from the danger into which German influences were leading her, seeing now that the Turkish Government had definitely joined their enemies, adhered to the course taken by Russia. Turkey by her own act had given the signal for her own destruction. All that the treacherous attack of the Turkish fleet on the Russian coast had done was to hasten the inevitable end of Ottoman sovereignty, after a record of continuous failure in the government and administration of the vast regions which the arms of Turkish troops had won in the past. Above all it was clear that the forbearance with which Europe had witnessed the long occupation of Constantinople by the Turks had been to no purpose and that the day had dawned when that occupation must end. Constantinople must inevitably come into the possession of the Power whose development had for centuries been cramped and confined by the barrier imposed on her outlet to the open sea at the narrow passagesisxtsrss ^ « advantage of civilisation iu general and thev S tlnv^ 8t p' 1 * ‘• Self and to the full assurances that the possession of Tow r ^ T 6 ^ j ^ ussian Grovernment from the Black Sea to the Medi?!, 0 and the u “™Peded road her hostility and bad faith, would rightlT fail'^o C B T ’ ,rke y '' ould lose through ments of France Bussia and r^!t r f to Eussla - The three Govern- early part of 1915 the following agreements 11 w 3 !? 0 ? 1 ! 11111 ^ 7 - COncluded in after the war Con S tanti 0 nopTrfnd ag t'S n strai’ts'IhaB b ^ “ reoo K nised dominions. 1 0 btraits sha11 b e added to the Russian Enclosure No. 2.

A statement on this subject was expected in the Itussian Duma on December 2nd, and the matter will probably be referred to m Parliament this week.

A circular letter to all the District Officers in vour Division, epitomisino' the information in this letter, will issue about 20th December. 5. It is very desirable that the Muhammadans whom you take into confidence should not conclude that we are anxious about the conduct of Indian Moslems, as they might imagine if you w T ere to hurry in from camp to see them. At the same time it is of some importance that the communic ation of the news should be roughly simultaneous in the different divisions. I am, therefore, to suggest that you should arrange, in the manner least likely to occasion talk and speculation, to have your conversations with prominent Muhammadans at some date or dates not earlier than the 15th or later than the 20th December. The Note accompanying this letter will, it is hoped, assist you in your conversations. There are of course passages in it which it would serve no useful purpose to communicate to an Indian Moslem: such, for example, as the reference to “ the forbearance with which Europe has witnessed the long occupation of Constantinople by the Turks ”. On the other hand, you will no doubt be able to emphasize the fact that the entire responsibility for the loss of Constantinople rests on Turkey itself, seeing that she entered the war without provocation. You will also probably find it useful to impress the sincere regard of the Allies for the religious feeling of Moslems, in their definite stipulation for the retention of independent Mussulman dominion over Arabia and the Holy Places in that country.

Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I am desired to r fer to the correspondence ending with your secret telegram No, 954-C., dated 3rd December, on the subject of the agreemen tconcluded between the British and Prussian GoTernments regardio' the Straits and Constantinople. It appears that an announcement regarding the agree ment has probably been made in the Russian Duma and in the British Parliament within the last lew days, but that steos have been taken to suppress all reference to the matter in Reuter’s and other news telegrams. It, seems probable, therefore, that information on the subject will not reach tins country until the arrival of the English mail in Christmas week. The Government of Bengal have, however, been asked to take steps now to prepare Moslem opinion for the announcement. 2- The Governor in Council has given the matter his most careful con sideration, and has come to the conclusion that more harm than good would be clone by communicating with the Muhammadan leaders on the subject at the present time, more than a fortnight before any authentic information will appear in the newspapers. Any such action would probably give rise to the wildest i union is and speculations. On the other hand, an announcement in the newspapers regarding the action contemplated at the end of the war would, according to the best informed opinion here, probably cause little excite- $ ment among the mass of Muhammadans in Bengal, who have long anticipated I some such lesult in the event of the war terminating decisively in favour of I the Allies. At the present time, however, they look upon the issue of the ; war as still hanging in the balance, and an announcement of the action proposed in what they regard as hypothetical circumstances would probably not perturb them very much, unless an agitation were organised to work upon their religious feelings. The Governor in Council fully realises the necessity of preventing any such agitation, but he thinks it desirable to postpone any active measures for this purpose until nearer the time when an authoritative announcement is made. He proposes, therefore, to defer taking the Muhammadan leaders into confidence until a few days before Christmas, and trusts that this course will meet with the approval of the Government of India. 3. His Excellency in Council has not overlooked the possibility of the news reaching India otherwise than through the English mail, but rumours of various kinds have been prevalent since the outbreak of the w^ar and have ceased to have much effect on Muhammadan opinion, which is not likely to pay much attention to anything less than an announcement in the newspapers. Nevertheless, a close watch will be kept on the situation, and arrangements will be made to get into touch with the Muhammadan leaders whenever necessity arises. The Press Censor is in close communication with the news papers and will obtain immediate information of the arrival of any news or rumours in this province. In the meantime, the newspapers have been for bidden to publish, without reference to the Press Censor, any news relating to Turkey or the Balkans beyond what appears in Reuter’s telegrams, and steps will be taken in due course to prevent them from publishing any comments regarding the Russo-British agreement.

He said to Macdonald that it was only what was to have been expected from the first as the result of Turkey’s bad faith, and that no one in Jaora cared a fig for Turkey. “ The Sultan ” he remarked “is not even a descendant of the Prophet, but descends from Ghenghis Khan ” : and he added “ you have conquered us and therefore it is our religious duty to stand by and never to forsake you”. Lastly, he thought that the only places where trouble misrht be anticipated were “the United Provinces, the Punjab and Bombay, where there are large numbers of people of no birth or position who are anxious to make names for themselves”. Dated Sehore, the 17th December 1916. From—W. S. Davis, Esq., Political Agent, Bhopal, To—The Hon’blb Mr. O. V. Bosanquet, C.S.I., C.I.E., Agent to the Governor- General in Central India, Indore. I spoke to the Begum yesterday about the agreement between the Bussiau Government and the Allies re the Straits and Constantinople, and I explained to her very carefully the contents of the note sent with Mr. Grant’s letter of 24th November 1916. She said she had so far heard nothing of the subject and her first comment was that the present was a most unfortunate moment for the publication of the agreement in India. She was of opinion that up till now the great mass of Muhammadans in India, in spite of the great strain put upon them in witnessing and even taking part in a war against the Sultan, whom they all looked, on as their Khalif, had remained loyal to Government. There had been exceptions, but, owing either to the good management of Government or to the fact that the persons who were actively disloyal to Government were few and unimportant, the Muhammadans as a whole had been with the Government. She said one of the reasons for this was that for several generations the Muhammadans of India had been taught from childhood to look on Russia as the enemy of Islam, and that all of them knew that Russia had over and over again attempted to wrest Constantinople from the Turks, and England had prevented them from doing so. She quoted a little saying which she said Muhammadan mothers all over India taught their children :— * “ Khuda is reech ko Hindustan se bachawe 2. She thought that the publication of the agreement in India was a very serious thing and would need the most careful and delicate handling by Government. It cannot be doubted that there will be a wave of indignation through the Muhammadans, and if evil results are to be avoided, the Viceroy and the Government will have to exercise the greatest care and diplomacy. Lord Hardinge, she thought, had created a most grateful feeling among the Muhammadans by his support of the Turkish Red Crescent during the Balkan War. The Indians knew that he had been at Constantinople, and was a firm friend of Turkey, and they looked on him as one of the band of Ambassadors and great Englishmen who had helped Turkey and Islam in evil days. At first she was in favour of Government issuing a long communique explaining the action of Britain from the beginning of the war re^ Turkey. Afterwards when I told her that Government had thought of this, and for very weighty reasons was averse to it, she said “ Well, I believe Government is right. Many people already in a sore frame of mind might say that the tacts and arguments in the communique were false, and that there was more behind it, and probably the communique would do more harm than good.’ She next said, “Well, as the news has to reach the people somehow, Government had better very gradually let it out through the press in carefully inspired articles. This thing is like a great misfortune w r hich has to be communicated to a * * I have heari of this and I asked an old Muhammadan Orderly if he had heard of it, and he said “ of course every woman sings that to her baby”.person who is already in great grief, it is a blow which will hurt, and increase that grief, and it should reach him gradually and be softened down as far as possible.” 3. I made a strong point of tluf guarantee of the Hedjaz and she said, “ Oh l all of us who have any intelligence or education know perfectly well that the Government has no prejudices, and is more than fair to the Muham madans, but you have to think of the ignorant and fanatical masses who don’t understand. Why, you have only just been talking of the Government wanting to erect a mosque for the sepoys at Basrah; isn’t this a proof of the Government’s good intentions to us ? I then said that it was because Government realized the ignorance of the masses, that I was giving her the information, and that similar steps were being taken throughout India with a view to the leaders and great men of the Muhammadans being in a position to explain to the people the difficulties which we had been faced with, and how England had done its utmost by getting the Allies to agree to the guarantee of the integrity of Turkey, even after it had become clear that the Turks were listening to the Counsels of Germany. She replied, “ I will do my best; it is German gold which has ruined Turkey, and the Turks are too foolish to see that even if Germany won the war, they would become a vassal State like Poland or the small kingdoms in Germany ”. 4. My conversation was rather a lengthy one, but I believe that I have given you everything of importance. Enclosube No. 15. Dated Viceroy’s Camp, the 6th January 1917. From—The Hon’ble Mr. A. H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To—The Hon’ble Mr. O. V. Bosanquet, C.S.I., C.I.E., Agent to the Governor- General in Central India, Indore. Thank you for your demi-official letter of the 27th December 1916, with which you enclosed Davis’ report on his conversations with Her Highness the Begum of Bhopal and the Nawab of Jaora regarding the agreement between Russia, Erance and England as to the disposal of Turkey. I showed your letter to His Excellency the Viceroy and discussed with him the advisability of his writing a personal letter to Her Highness the Begum as suggested by you. After full consideration His Excellency.thinks that there are grave objections to his doing this. In the first place it would be very difficult for the Viceroy to write such a letter without committing himself to expressions of sympathy which are neither in accord with the policy of His Majesty’s Government nor with the attitude of the Government of India. The bald fact remains that the Turks made themselves our enemies and are therefore the secular enemies of every loyal Chief in India and it would be obviously improper for the Viceroy to indicate sympathy with a Ruling Chief who entertained feelings of sorrow at the downfall of our enemies however natural such feelings might be. The Viceroy however thinks that there would be no objection to your conveying to Her Highness through Davis a verbal message from him indicat ing his appreciation of the attitude which she has adopted in this matter; such a verbal message would be sufficiently vague not in any way to commit the Viceroy and should have some effect of soothing Her Highness’ feelings.

B., dated the 16th December 1916. *«»*«** Little or no comment has been caused among the people by recent events in Roumania. The sinking of the mail steamer Arabia, however, ha$11 attracted renewed attention to the submarine campaign. The newspapers have followed the political crisis at home with interest. There seems to be some regret at Mr. Asquith’s relinquishing office. Arrangements have been made, in accordance with the instructions of the Government of India, to prepare Muhammadan public opinion for the news of the Russian agreement regarding Constantinople. It is too early as yet to say how the information is being received. Q he publication of Germany’s peace proposals will facilitate the announcement as showing one of the conditions on which the Allies wall make peace, but in any case the announcement must inevitably cause pain to Indian Muham- ! madans who have so long regarded England as the saviour of Constantinople from the clutches of Russia. Enclosuhe No. 17. Extract from a letter from the Government of Bombay, No. S. D.-2799, dated the Slst December 1916. 4s. It is reported that the local Muhammadan leaders to whom the agree ment has been made known so far have received the announcement that Con stantinople is to be handed over to Russia philosophically and it would appear probable that very little, if any, feeling uill be aroused. To the Muhammadans there is always the possibility that the Allies will never be in a position to give effect to the agreement and the present situation in the Balkans makes the probability of the agreement ever becoming effective too remote for them to take the matter seriously at present. Enclosure No. 18. Extract from a letter from the Government of Bengal, No. 107-B., dated the 2nd January 1917. 3. Attitude of people. —The recent fighting in Mesopotamia has caused various rumours to be renewed and operations there are being closely followed bv the Muhammadan community. Hajis who have returned from pilgrimage consider the Medina route unsafe, but they state that they have been very well treated this year. It is rumoured that the Grand Sheriff has fled and that as Turkey does not wish to shed blood in the Holy Land, she will not attempt to punish bis followers now. The enemy success in R-oumania is still the subject of much comment and some slight apprehension that Germany may yet find a way to attack India. The refusal of the Allies to listen to the offers of peace made by the Central Powers has evoked some surprise and disappoint ment. It is rumoured that fighting is going on in the North-West Erontier Provinces in consequence of which people are not being allowed to proceed to that part of India and goods are not being received by the railway authorities for despatch to the Punjab. This rumour is being contradicted. The general public appear much gratified at the visit of His Excellency the Viceroy but are a little apprehensive about his policy towards Bengal. The news regarding the Russo-British agreement appeared in the “ Statesman ” of the 29th December. The leading Muhammadans had previously been informed and the newspapers had been warned to abstain from comment. So far the news seems to have made little impression on the Muhammadan community as a whole.5BPSfeie*£fe Enclosure No. 19. Extract jrom a letter from the Government of the United Provinces, Eo. 1697-C., dated the 6th January 1917. »•**** 2 The Russian treaty was explained by Commissioners or district officers to leading Muhammadans in all parts of the province during the third week of December. The news was taken calmly and in fact in most places it is said to have fallen flat. The general attitude was one of resignation to the inevitable stripping of Turkey, while there was a feeling of gratitude among all classes of Muhammadans because they have been taken into the confidence of Government. The chief anxiety was for peace m the Hedjaz when war ceases and for a strong and independent Moslem administration there. At Lucknow, which proved in June last to be the mam focus of excitement over the revolt by the Sheriff, the Commissioner had an entirely satisfactory interview. The minds of leading Muhammadans were much more exercised over the home rule question than anything else. _ One leading local Muhammadan, the Raja of Jahangirabad, &lt; while expressing no regret at the announcement, asked whether Karbala will be included in the Holy Places of Arabia which will come into Muhammadan sovereignty in Arabia. He considered this an important stipulation. The Raja of Mahmudabad desired to know whether the political independence of Arabia and the Hedjaz would resemble the independence of Egypt. He wa-s informed that the intention, so far as we know, is to give absolute independence under a Muham- madan sovereign. All those present gave assurances that there would be no protest against the contemplated arrangements. Saiyid Wazir Hasan, Secretary of the Muslim League, added that it was now proposed to keep the operations of that League entirely apart from all religious affairs. It would concern itself in future mainly with domestic politics. He proceeded to say that the present talk about the home rule reforms, &amp;c, was not intended to embarrass Government. It was really caused by apprehension that India would be subject to the colonies as well as to Great Britain and that peace might come at any time. The colonies were already pressing for a share in the rule of the empire and this would mean interference in Indian commerce, tariff, &amp;c., and with India generally. Enclosure No. 20.

Reports have now come in regarding the manner in which the inform ation regarding the probable fate of Constantinople has been received by responsible Muhammadans and the general opinion is that there is no reason to anticipate any popular excitement when it becomes generally known. Ihe indifference has’been particularly marked in the Muhammadan districts of the north and south-vfest of the province where the population is mainly rural and therefore little affected by political intrigue. In the Jhang District none of those who were given the information expressed any sympathy with the Turks, and two of them went further and said that it would be a good thing if, instead of making the Hedjaz an independent State, we were to take the country under our own rule. In the Attock District the news was re ceived without the slightest show of interest. In the Jhelum District the opinion was expressed that Turkey by her action towards the Allies richly deserved condign punishment. The District Magistrate, Montgomery, himself a Muhammadan, reports “ I doubt whether any arrangement arrived at Wween England and Russia regarding the future of Turkey will cause much painful surprise to the people. They have known all along that the TurksIS liave staked everything on the result of the present war ” The District Magis trate, Ludhiana—also a Muhammadan—reports “From what I have been able to gather so far, I find that Mussalmans, although not elated at the prospect, will be reconciled to the inevitable »; thougli he goes on to say that the wisdom ot the step, in making Russia so powerful, is doubted in intelligent quarters. Ibis in the Lieutenant-Governor’s opinion represents the general view ot Muhammadans who take an interest in the political situation From two districts it is reported that the news excites the less interest for the reason that it is dependent on the collapse of Turkey, an achievement which has still to be effected. And there is a general belief that Turkey is still playing a great part in the war. r ^ o The attitude of the people is everywhere reported to be good. The Deputy Commissioner, Lahore, reports that the German offer of peace has borne to the people greater conviction as to the ultimate result of the war than anything which has gone before. The high prices prevailing are a matter of more serious concern than the events in Europe. It is considered that they are due to the war; and the people, in consequence, long for peace.

Steps have, as requested by the Government of India, been taken to prepare Muhammadan opinion for a declaration as to the intention of the Allies in regard to Constantinople. The matter has not aroused particular attention, and there have even been opinions expressed that Constantinople seems in no particular danger of capture. It is unlikely that when the declaration becomes public property it will attract increased notice. » * * * * * * m Enclosure No. 22.

The newspaper references to the agreement with respect to Constanti nople have not created any stir amongst Muhammadans. The apparent indiffer ence with which this community has received the news may be ascribed to a popular belief that Turkey is going to win in the end and that the terms of the agreement are never likely to be enforced. The announcement would have provoked more comment, if, at the time that it was made, Turkey had been in more imminent danger of defeat and disruption, for the idea that the defeat of | Turkey means the fall of Islam has of late been sedulously disseminated among Muhammadans in this Presidency by an emissary from 'the Nadwar-ul- Ulema (assembly of learned men) of Aligarh. This emissary, who is known at the Moulvi Shamlavi, has gone back to North India to recruit his health but is expected to return this month for a preaching tour in which he will be assisted by Muhammadans possessing a knowledge of Tamil. He will be care fully watched.

The announcement regarding the future destiny of Constantinople has now been made public in the papers received from England, but so iar it does not appear to have attracted any attention among the Muhammadans here. Those who think about the matter at all had* very likely made up their minds long ago that, if the result of the war is favourable, Constantinople will be banded over to the Russians; while among the majority the feeling probably is that the end is so far otf that the future disposal of Constantinople is too remote to be worth considering.

It is, therefore, too early yet to say what the effect on IndiaS opinion will be, but such comments as have been received by the Chiet Commissioner are to the effect that such an expression ot peace terms on the part of Russia is at least somewhat previous as Turkey is considered by no means vanquished as yet.

The interest displayed at the time in the proceedings and the “ demands ” of the Congress and Muslim League has died down, but from Ferozepur, which was one of the few districts to send a representative to the Congress meeting at Lucknow, it is reported that efforts are being made to popularise the Itome Rule propaganda.

After full consideration His Excellency thinks that there are grave objections to his doing this. In the first place it would be very difficult for the Viceroy to write such a letter without coo itting himself to expressions of sympathy which are neither in accord with the policy of His Majesty's Government nor with the attitude of the Government of India. The bald fact remains that the Turks made themselves our enemies and are therefore the secular enemies of every loyal Chief in India and it would be obviously improper for the Viceroy to indicate sympathy with a Puling Chief who entertained feelings of sorrow at the downfall of our enemies however natural such feelings mi grit be Tin-&gt; TIiq Viceroy liowever thinks tho-t there would he no objection to your conveying to Her Highness through Lav is a verbal message from him indicating his appreciation of the attitude which she has adopted in this matter; such i verbal message would be sufficiently vague not in any wa^ to commit the Viceroy and should have some effect of soothing Her Hi^jhness 1 feelings.

October 1916. SECRET. [ 186945 ] No. 1. 4 Viscount Grey to Lord Bertie. (No. 655.) My Lord, Foreign Office, October 2, 1916. IN view of the desirability of publishing in the near future the agreement arrived at regarding the future of Constantinople, it is of importance that His Majesty’s Government and the French and Russian Governments should agree in advance on a formula by which this publication may be made. With this end in view, I transmit to your Lordship herewith a memorandum, which has been approved by His Majesty’s Government, setting forth the reasons why at the end of the war Constantinople and the Straits of the Dardanelles should inevitably be annexed to the Russian Empire. This document might, in my opinion, serve as a preamble to any collection of papers which the three - Governments may decide to publish on the subject. I request, therefore, that your Lordship will communicate the text to the President of the Council, and if his Excellency concurs in the terms thereof, I should he glad if M. Briand would send instructions to the French Ambassador at Petrograd to concert with Sir G. Buchanan in communicating it to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs for his approval or observations, with a view to its eventual publication simultaneously with the text of the notes exchanged between the three Governments. An alternative procedure would be to abstain from issuing the actual text of the agreements, but to publish this memorandum with a mere statement of the decision arrived at by the three Powers with any explanatory details that may be considered necessary. I am, &amp;c. GREY OF FALLODON. u ; Enclosure. lip, Note. THE action of the Turkish Government at the beginning of the war in providing refuge for the German ships “ Goeben ” and “ Breslau ” made it clear to the Allied Powers that there were misguided influences at Constantinople which, blinded by a false appreciation of the strength of the Central Powers, would drag Turkey into the war on the side of Germany, and thereby themselves deal the final blow to the Turkish Empire, whose welfare the Allies had so long and so unweariedly laboured to promote. In spite of the equivocal attitude assumed from the first by the Turkish Government, the Allies made every effort to induce the Sublime Porte to hold aloof from the struggle, participation in which could only mean for Turkey the immediate selling herself into bondage to Germany, and the ultimate disintegration of ber Empire, which it had long been foreseen would occur as soon as Turkey took part in, or became the scene of, a movement of world forces such as is the present war. The Allies did not ask Turkey to take part in the war on their side ; they only asked that she should remain neutral in her own interests, and they gave her the most solemn assurances and guarantees that in this case her territorial integrity and her independence would he left untouched. A guarantee of integrity and independence was offered to Turkey; neutrality was all that the Allies asked of her. None the less, in the early morning of the 29th October, 1914, a treacherous and unprovoked attack was made without warning by ships of war under the Turkish flag on the vessels and harbours of a neighbouring Power, with whom Turkey was then at ! :peace. Russia, who had suffered this unprecedented violation of the most ordinary rules of international law and usage, had no course left but to make the only reply to a Power capable of committing such acts, namely, to treat her as an enemy, and the Allies of Russia, who had in the past upheld Ottoman sovereignty and who m this war had done their utmost to save Turkey from the danger into which German influences were leading her, seeing new that the Turkish Government had definitely -joined their enemies, adhered to the course taken by Russia. Turkey by her own act had given the signal for her own destruction. All that the treacherous attack of the Turkish fleet on the Russian coast had done was to hasten the inevitable end of Ottoman sovereignty, after a record of continuous failure in the government and administration of the vast regions which the arms of Turkish troops had won in the past. Above all, it was_ clear that the forbearance with which Europe had witnessed the long occupation of Constantinople by the Turks had been to no purpose and that the day had dawned when that occupation must end. Constantinople must inevitably come into the possession of the Power whose' expansion^ had for centuries been cramped and confined by the barrier imposed on her outlet to the open sea at the narrow passages of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. The British and Erench Governments realised clearly that this consummation was both just in itself and to the advantage of civilisation in general, and they &lt;^ave the Russian Government full assurances that the possession ot Constantinople, and the unimpeded road from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, which Turkev would lose through her hostility and bad faith, would rightly fall to Russia The three Governments of France, Russia, and Great Britain accordingly concluded in the early part of 1915 the following agreements, whereby it is recognised that after the war Constantinople and the Straits shall be added to the Russian dominions. . , , In all negotiations respecting Turkish dominions it has been stipulated and agreed between the Allies that the Mussulman Holy Places and Arabia shall under all circumstances remain under independent Mussulman Dominion.

There may be paiamount international reasons of which we are unaware for proposed publication. If not, we are unanimous in deprecating it at this stage. As regards India, Moslem feeling would only be unnecessarily excited and exacerbated by an announcement at the present juncture of details of intended dismemberment of Turkey. This would. inevitably leave deep- seated resentment which would grow in volume with protraction of war and thereby add to our post-bellum difficulties. Moreover, if by chance the intentions announced should not hereafter be fully realised, loss of prestige would be added to odium. Facts, not anticipatory pronouncements, appeal to the Oriental. He will accept quietly a fait aecompli, but it is useless to attempt to prepare ground. This does not lead to submissive acquiescence but to brooding of which intriguers would take advantage. As regards Afghanistan, announcement would provoke storm of resentment, and if it should by chance synchronise with other disturbing facts, such as further Turkish advance in Persia, might make Amir’s position impossible, and precipitate war in the hope that such diversion might save Turkey from her fate.IFrom Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, &lt;■ 5th September 1916. Very secret. It is proposed shortly to publish agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Russian Government regarding future_ of Constantinople and Straits. This agreement made in March 1915 provides that, subject to satisfactory conclusion of war and realisation of desiderata of Great Britain and France, Constantinople, Sea of Marmara and Dardanelles and Southern Thrace up to Enos Midia line, should be incorporated in Russian Empire. Also Tenedos and Imbros and part of the Asiat ic coast between Bosporus river, Sakharia and a point to be fixed on Gulf of Isniid. Please telegraph as soon as possible your views regarding probable effect of publication in India and Afghanistan. You will be able to state that throughout negotiations, His Majesty’s Government stipulated that Mussulman holy places and Arabian peninsula should under all circumstances remain under independent Moslem dominion.The Under-Secretary of x Sta^Qf^SFqre^n Affairs presents his compliments to the UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop V of the under-mentioned paper.

I said that I was afraid that it would not he possible for me to ascertain your views by Tuesday and that I could not authorize such a statement without your instructions as I did not know how publication in the form of speech would commend itself to you and to French Government. There would not be moreover time to inform Japanese and Italian Governments of proposed publication as desired in your telegram No. 261?* I then expressed hope that publication of our agreement would be foil.owed as His Excellency had himself suggested by that of a Manifesto to Poles. His Excellency said Kurrion, Government were about to communicate to Allied Governments text of protest against Germany's action but that situation had so changed that projected manifesto was hardly applicable to present circumstances. I replied that events were rather tending to give an interrntional character to Polish question and that if I might make a suggestion I thought that apart from question of extent oi autonomy to be granted to Poles an assurance was required that it was the intention of Allies to reunite them as far as possible in a single state.

The /Miles did not ask Turkey to take part in the war on their side: they only asked that she should remain neutral in her own interests, and they gave her the most role® assurances and guarantees that in this case her territorial integrityintegrity and her independence would he left un touched. n guarantee of integrity and independence was offered to furlcey: neutrality was all that the allies asked of her. Kone tiie less, in the early raorning of the S9th October, 1314, a treacherous and unprovoked attack was made without warning by ships of war under the lurkiab flag on the vessels .'and harbours of a neighbouring Power, wlI rkey was then at peace. Russia, who had suffered this unprecedented violation of the moat ordinary rules of international law end usage, had no course left but to ixiie the only reply to a Power capable of oosanittlng such acts, namely, to treat her as an enemy; and the allies of I ass la, who had in the past upheld Ottoman sovereignty and who in tills war had done their utmost to save iurkey irm the danger into which Comm influences were leading her, seeing now that the Turkish '-ovornment had definitely joined their enemies, adhered to the course taken by Russia. Turkey by her own act had given the signal for her own destruction. All that the treacherous attack of the ±urkiah fleet on tiie Russian coast had done was to hasten the inevitable end of Ottoman sovereignty, after a • record of continuous failure in the government -aid administration of the vast regions which the arms of Turkish troops had won in the past. .bove all it was clear that the forbearance with which i-urope had witnessed the long occupation of Constantinople byby the Turks had been to no purpose and that the day had darned '.'hen that ©eolation must end* Constantinople must inevitably come into the possession of the ov/er whose expansion had for centuries been cramped and confined by the barrier imposed on her outlet to the open sea at the narrow passages of the Bosphorus and the •v Dardanelles. The British and French Govemnents realised clearly that this consunsnation was both just in itself and to the advantage of civilisation in general, and they gave the ijosslaa Sovemaent full assurances that the possession of r- Con.'.b‘intlno;&gt;le, .'hd tfio unimpeded roiid from the Black sea to the hediterranean. Which Turkey would lose throu h her hostility and bad faith, would rightly fall to Russia.

There may be paramount international reasons of which we are unaware for proposed publication. If not, we are unanimous in deprecating it at this stage. As regards India, Moslem feeling would only lie unnecessarily excited and exacerbated by an announcement at the present juncture of details of intended dismemberment of Turkey. This would inevitably leave deep- seated resentment which would grow in volume with protraction of war and thereby add to our post-bellum difficulties. Moreover, if by chance the intentions announced should not hereafter be fully realised, loss of prestige would be added to odium. Facts, not anticipatory pronouncements, appeal to the Oriental. He will accept quietly a fait accompli, but jjL-js useless to _attempt to prepare ground... This does not lead to submissive acquiescence but to brooding of which intriguers would take advantage. As regards Afghanistan, announcement would provoke storm of resentment, and if it should by chance synchronise with other disturbing facts, such as further Turkish advance in Persia, might make Amir’s position impossible, and precipitate war in the hope that such diversion might save Turkey from her fate.Foreign Office S.W.

IN accordance with your instructions, and after consultation with my French colleague, I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday morning that, subject to the war being prosecuted to a successful conclusion and to the desiderata of Great Britain and France in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere being realised, His Majesty’s Government wmild agree to the Russian aide-memoire on the subject of Constantinople and the Straits, which his Excellency had handed to me on the 4th March, and of which I have the honour to transmit a copy herewith. I at the same time gave his Excellency an aide-memoire to the above effect, embodying your telegram No. 329 of the 10th March, though, in order not to compromise the cypher, 1 had been obliged to alter the sequence of the words. I then read to him and left with him a memorandum, in which I have recorded the observations which you had, in your telegram No. 43, Private and Secret, of the 11th instant, instructed me to make on the subject of our assent to the Russian demands. Copies of both these documents are enclosed. After expressing in warm terms his satisfaction at receiving this communication, his Excellency said that hemiad no objections to raise to any of the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government, with the sole exception of the conversion into an English sphere of the present neutral sphere in Persia. The question of railways made it very difficult for Russia to renounce all her existing rights in that sphere, and, if she did, she would have to ask us to allow her in return to be absolute mistress in her own sphere. After some further conversation on the subject, I told his Excellency that I had been instructed to make personally to the Emperor the same communication which I had just made to him, and enquired when I could have the honour of an audience. M. Sazonof replied that this would not be at all easy to arrange, as His Majesty was leaving the next morning for the front, and would probably be engaged with audiences all the afternoon, as he himself was to have one late in the evening* I then suggested that, as the Emperor would probably wish to consult him before replying to the communication which 1 had been instructed to make, His Majesty might perhaps consent to receive us both together. This his Excellency kindly arranged, and I accordingly accompanied him to Tsarskoe. I have, in my telegram No. 54, Private and Secret, of yesterday’s date, reported that the Emperor, in the course of our audience, authorised me to inform you that he consented in principle to the neutral sphere being incorporated in the British sphere, but that M. Sazonof will probably insist on our giving in return some assurances as to Russia’s liberty of action in her own sphere. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. i Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Retrograde, le 19 fevrier (4 mars), 1915. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Aide-memoire communicated to M. Sazonof, March 12, 1915. SUBJECT to the war being carried on and brought to a successful conclusion, and to the desiderata of Great Britain and France in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere being realised as indicated in the Russian communication herein referred to, His Majesty’s ^Government will agree to the Russian Government’s aide-memoire relative to Constantinople and the Straits, the text of which was communicated to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador by his Excellency M. Sazonof on the 19th February (4th March), 1915. Petrograd, February 27 (March 12), 1915. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Memorandum. HIS Majesty’s Ambassador has been instructed to make the following observa tions with reference to the aide-memoire which this Embassy had the honour of addressing to the Imperial Government on the 27th February (12th March), 1915. The claim made by the Imperial Government in their aide-memoire of the 19th February (4th March), 1915, considerably exceeds the desiderata which were foreshadowed by M. Sazonof as probable a few weeks ago. Before His Majesty’s Government have had time to take into consideration what their own desiderata elsewhere would be in the final terms of peace, Russia is asking for a definite promise that her wishes shall be satisfied with regard to what is in fact the richest prize of the entire war. Sir Edward Grey accordingly hopes that M. Sazonof will realise that it is not in the power of His Majesty’s Government to give a greater proof of friendship than that which is afforded by the terms of the above-mentioned aide-memoire. That document involves a complete reversal of the traditional policy of His Majesty s Government, and is in direct opposition to the opinions and sentiments at one time universally held in England and which have still by no means died out. Sir Edward Grey therefore trusts that the Imperial Government will recognise that the recent general assurances given to M. Sazonof have been most loyally and amply fullilled. In presenting the aide-memoire now, His Majesty’s Government believe and hope that a lasting friendship between Russia and Great Britain will be assured as soon as the proposed settlement is realised. . . , From the British aide-memoire it follows that the desiderata of His Majesty s Government, however important they may be to British interests in other parts of the world, will contain no condition which could impair Russia’s control over the territories described in the Russian aide-memoire of the 19th February (4th March), 1915 - . . . . * r In view of the fact that Constantinople will always remain a trade entrepot tor South-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor, His Majesty’s Government will ask that Russia shall, when she comes into possession of it, arrange for a free port for goods m transit to and from non-Russian territory. His Majesty’s Government will also ask that there shall be commercial freedom for merchant-ships passing through the Straits, as M. Sazonof has already promised.Except in so far as the naval and military operations on which His Majesty’s Government are nmv engaged in the Dardanelles may contribute to the common cause of the Allies, it is now clear that these operations, however successful, cannot be of any advantage to His Majesty’s Government in the final terms of peace. Russia alone will, if the war is successful, gather the-direct fruits of these operations. Russia should therefore, m the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, not now put difficulties in the way of any Power which may, on reasonable terms, offer to co-operate with the Allies. The only Power likely to participate in the operations in the Straits is Greece. Admiral Carden has asked the Admiralty to send him more destroyers, but they have none to spare. The assistance of a Greek flotilla, if it could have been secured, would thus have been of inestimable value to His Majesty’s Government. To induce the neutral Balkan States to join the Allies was one of the main objects which His Majesty’s Government had in view when they undertook the operations in the Dardanelles. His Majesty’s Government hope that Russia will spare no pains to calm the apprehensions of Bulgaria and Roumania as to Russia’s possession of the Straits and Constantinople being to their disadvantage. His Majesty’s Government also hope that Russia will do everything in her power to render the co-operation of these two States an attractive prospect to them. Sir E. Grey points out that it will obviously be necessary to take into considera tion the whole question of the future interests of France and Great Britain in what is now Asiatic Turkey; and, in formulating the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government wdth regard to the Ottoman Empire, he must consult the French as. well as the Russian Government. As soon, however, as it becomes known that Russia is to have Constantinople at the conclusion of the war, Sir E. Grey will wish to state that, throughout the negotiations, His Majesty’s Government have stipulated that the Mussulman Holy Places and Arabia shall under all circumstances remain under independent Mussulman dominion. Sir E. Grey is as yet unable to make any definite proposal on any point of the British desiderata ; but one of the points of the latter will be the revision of the Persian portion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 so as to recognise the present neutral sphere as a British sphere. Until the Allies are in a position to give to the Balkan States, and especially to Bulgaria and Roumania, some satisfactory assurance as to their prospects and general position with regard to the territories contiguous to their frontiers to the possession of which they are known to aspire; and until a more advanced stage of the agreement as to the French and British desiderata in the final peace terms is reached, Sir E. Grey points out that it is most desirable that the understanding now arrived at between the Russian, French, and British Governments should remain secret.
