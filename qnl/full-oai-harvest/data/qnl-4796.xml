The Political Agent in Bahrain sent letters to the rulers of the Trucial Coast to inform them about the celebration taking place and to suggest that the same celebration should take place in their areas. Letters of congratulation were sent by a few Gulf rulers including Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim Al Thani, Shaikh Hamad bin `Isa Al Khalifa and Shaikh Sultan Bin Saqr al-Qasimi to congratulate The King on the occasion.The correspondence is mainly between Their Majesties’ Silver Jubilee Fund, the Political Agencies and Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Shaikh Hamad bin `Isa Al Khalifa, and the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Fundraising</topic></subject><subject><topic>Royal jubilees</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00019a#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00019a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00019a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00019a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00019a#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
