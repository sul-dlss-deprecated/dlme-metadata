Resident's telegram of Novem ber 12th 1874, to the Private Secre- 1^. Of the notes of evidence recorded, Ap- ti,ry ' pendix A. 2ndly. —Of my opinion on the whole case as it now stands, Appendix B. and accompaniments. Srdly. —Of my separate statement regarding the attitude of His Highness the Maharaja and his Minister relating to the case under report. 2. It will be seen that I have arrived at the following conclusions:— 1^.—That an undoubted attempt to poison me has been made by two or more persons of the Residency Establishment, who have no conceivable per sonal motives for the crime, and who utterly repudiate its commission. tndly. —That arsenic aud diamond dust were at least two of the ingredients used to effect the crime in question, from which fact it appears clear that the household servant or servants under suspicion must have been supplied by some person of rank with the more costly of these ingredients. ?&gt;rdly. —That this attempt on my life was made with the cognizance and con nivance of His Highness the Maharaja, two of whose confidential servants have been conspiring for months past with one of the Residency table servants, who is now suspected of having been the main instrument in the recent attempt to poison me. ^thly. —That all motive of private malice, as opposed to political motive, is not only repudiated, but is under the circumstances stated entirely out of the question. Sthly. —Judging from my own experience of the Durbar Police and judicial Vide Appendix a . of the Comnm. administration supported by the opinion of the sion Report, Schedule I., case 4, para- Commission I believe that SO long as His Higll- grapb X11 ' nessMulhar Rao remains in power at Baroda, there is no reasonable hope of further evidence that may lead to the detection of the real instigator of the crime being obtained, it being a fact, notwithstanding the Durbar professions expressed in Appendix C., that, in addition to the per- No, i.—Yeai,w.itit rho Yeota. s 0 ' s ' 1 &lt; )W actually in custody there are three con- No. 2.— Madhow Rao Kaiay. fideiitial servants ot His Highness w r ho are stronglv No. 3* Arab Sowar Saiam. suspected by me of complicity in the comniis- sion of it. Of these three persons one has within the last two or three days 1been sent to the Decean, professedly to Akulkote, to visit a saint in that neigh bourhood ; another died suddenly the day before yesterday, it is alleged, by poison, as he was likely to have proved an inconvenient witness; and the tUird, tlie Arab Sowar Salam, it is publicly rumoured, has just obtained leave ot absence to go on n, pilgrimage to Mecca: this last however wants connimation. 3. Having thus stated the main conclusions at which I have arrived, it onlv remains for me to supplement the judicial proceedings under despatch, with a brief summary of the ample and highly important political evidence on record in the Resident's Office regarding the personal character and antecedents of His Highness Mulhar Rao Gaekwar from 1857 up to the present time, a perusal of which will throw light upon the principal events of His Highness Mulhar Rao's reign and previously; and at the same time show with Avhat deli berate subtlety, forethought, and secrecy this Indian Prince plans and executes his fell designs by means of his minions and assassins; also how, notwithstand ing the evidence obtained and recorded against him in former years, Mulhar Rao has hitherto eluded that justice which it is now hoped may overtake him. 4. This Prince commenced his career of crime in 1857 when about 25 or 20 years of age. In my confidential report to Government, No. 35A., dated the 9th February 1S74, it was clearly shown that, in the month of October 1857, the peace of Guzerat was seriously threatened by a projected outbreak of the cooly population in the Gaekwaree District of Beejapoor and in the British District of Kaira through certain Thakoors residing in Pertabpoor. 5. On the 19th October 1857, Sir Richmond Shakespear, the then Resi dent of Baroda, reported to Government that the object of this conspiracy embraced in the first instance the plunder of the city of Ahmedabad, after which an advance to raise the coolies of the Ivaira District on the banks of the Mahee about Pertabpoor, &amp;c., was to have been made, and afterwards an advance on Baroda for the purpose of dethroning the then reigning Gaekwar Khunde Rao was to complete the general design. Had the latter been effected the person who would have gained most by the transaction would have been the present Gaekwar Mulhar Rao whose personal participation in the plot was shown by quotations from the official correspondence of that day as well as by the accompaniments of the report under reference. 6. A perusal of the report in question will show that His Highness Mul har Rao was mainly saved from exposure at the time, because Sir Richmond Shakespear believed him to be an idiot and unable to organize so extensive a conspiracy ; hence although he was distinctly proved a few years after to have been the prime mover in tiie renewed conspiracy of 18G3 against the life of his brother, he again escaped adequate punishment, because Colonel 'Wallace, the Resident, adopting the opinion of his predecessor, described Mulhar Rao as ' intellectually feeble and apparently irresponsible for his actions.' 7. When the conspiracy of 1863 was planned, Mulhar Rao and his four principal accomplices were almost daily frequenting the British Camp at Baroda for the purpose of selecting instruments, who, they believed, would not betray their nefarious designs upon the life of the reigning Gaekwar Khunde Rao. 8. Strange to say one of the principal Agents, to whom overtures were made on this occasion, wa? an European Non-Commissioned Officer, named Higgins, the Serjeant-Major of the 28tli Native Infantry at Baroda. Minor instruments were found at the Residency in the person of a Naik of peons, named Doolub Sing, who with his two brothers, Man Sing and Prem Sing, became the tools of Mulhar Rao and still reside at Baroda. Thus so long back as ten years ago, Mulhar Rao did not hesitate to tamper with servants of the British Govern ment, both European and Native. 9. Serjeant-Major Higgins, as might have been expected, divulged the whole plot to the then Resident, Colonel Wallace. Mulhar Rao's four accomplices were seized, convicted, and sentenced to terms of long imprisonment; whilst the main conspirator himself was merely placed in confinement at Padra 23 without any delinitely expressed intention regarding his term of imprisonment, Colonel Wallace's report to Govern- &amp;c. A perusal of the llesident's report and of the 3tSnp';Scv'Sce 3rJ Ausu • , • evi &lt;ieuee in the case will show that sorcery, poison, Also proceedings of the Durbar in or sliooting were specified as the means by any one tl ' ( :,M ' of which the death of Khunde Rao was to be effected. The poison which had been procured from the Civil Hospital was deposited for safety with Serjeant-Major Higgias, until it might be required for use by one ol His Highness Khunde Rao's confidential servants, who had been gained over by Mulhar Rao's Agents to administer the poison in either the Maharaja's food or his drinking water. The general similarity of this plan with that followed in the attempt to poison the Resident under report, through the medium of the Residency Chobdar and table servant, Faizoo, the Kazee Dada Meeya, and the Arab servant Salam is worthy of attention. 10. It is moreover deserving of special note that, although in the 18G3 con spiracy Tatya Shastree confessed liis crime and was sentenced to life imprison ment, yet that as soon as Mulhar Rao came to the throne in 1871, he released this confessedly guilty prisoner and such of his accomplices as still survived from prison, thus affording additional evidence, were such required, of his own personal guilt as the instigator of their diabolical designs. 11. To return, however, to the events of the year 1863 it is necessary to mention that though the main criminals had been justly dealt with in September of that year, yet that certain of Mulhar R io's Agents and accom plices residing in the Baroda Cantonment and the Residency, who had escaped detection, were incited to revenge Mulhar Rao's detection upon the faithful Serjeant-Major Higgins, who after a course of persecution from the assassins narrowly escaped being shot dead whilst lying upon his cot in the British Can tonment. The result was that he had to be removed from the 28th Native Infantry, and although His Highness Khunde Rao, with the sanction of Govern ment, made him a handsome remuneration for his faithful services, still the fact remains that Mulhar Rao's secret Agents succeeded in hunting down this British soldier with utter impunity—a manoevre which the sequel of this report and its accompanim mt shows that the same Mulhar Rao has been putting in practice towards the British Resident, Colonel Phayre, for the last few months, and it remains to be seen whether he is to be allowed to succeed now as formerly. 12. This evidence of the years 1857 and 1863 places His Highness Mulhar Rao's character as a traitor to both his own and the British Government, and as the would-be murderer of his own brother and sovereign, and of Serjeant- Major Higgins in its true light. It moreover afforded plain evidence of what his future career was likely to be were the power to do mischief on a large scale ever entrusted to him. 13. Accordingly although he was thrown into prison as above stated, yet even in that position he ingeniously contrived to hatch fresh plots against his brother's life by means of fresh Agents who opened secret communications with him. 14. Amongst these was a disreputable person who went by the name of vide Revd. Mr. Taylor's evidence, Kazee Dada Meeya, w r ho, it is said, had been obliged appendix a . to fly from Cliandodc in the Nassik District, in con sequence of his having seduced and taken into keeping his own niece. This man was at first engaged in endeavouring to obtain Mulhar Rao's release from prison, and he used to Visit Bombay for that purpose. His connection with the case immediately under report will be seen in the accompanying evidence. 15. Amongst others also who assisted Mulhar Rao when in prison at Padra were the two confidential personal attendants of His Highness, Yeshwunt Rao Yeola and the Arab sowar Salam, both of whom, though then in His Highness Khunde Rao's service, have attained notoriety as the instruments of Mulhar Rao since he came to the throne in December 1870. » 16. Early in 1867, these renewed intrigues of Mulhar Rao and his accom plices to murder and supplant his brother culminated in a third conspiracy on which occasion upwards of 20 persons were arrested, some of whom wereexecuted • some imprisoned for various periods ; and some escaped detection alto- gether Reference to this outbreak is made in paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Report No. 35A. of the 9th February 1874, above quoted. 17. His Hio-hness Khunde Rao died suddenly on the 28th November 1870, and the then Resident, Colonel Barr, in consultation with the Acting Minister, sent to summon Mulhar Rao from Padra to assume the reins of Government, on the condition that his recognition as the reigning Gaekwar must be dependent upon the sanction of the British Government. To this Mulhar Rao readily assented and it shortly afterwards became known that Jumna Baee, the widow of His Highness Khunde Rao was pregnant, the British Government permitted Mulhar^Rao to assume the administration of the State as Regent till the result of the widowed Ranee's pregnancy should decide the question of his succession to the guddee in his own right or not. 18. No sooner had Mulhar Rao thus unexpectedly obtained the object of all his conspiracies and plots during the previous 13 years than as might have been expected, he at once initiated the reign of terror which has lasted with little intermission ever since. Most of the graver personal cases against him, such as the sudden deaths in prison of the Ex-Minister, Bhow Sindia, Rowjee Master Gunnoo Wagh, Mulharba Shelke, and Govindjee Naik, all of whom are universally alleged to have been poisoned by Mulhar Rao's Agents, were not enquired into by the Commission, nor were the cases of the Ex-Ranee Jumna Baee and the Ranee Rukhma Baee and many others, evincing the most heartless cruelty and persecution on Mulhar Rao's part, but they have been the subject of correspondence with Government since the Commission closed its sittings. 19. It is unnecessary to lengthen this report by quotations from the proceedings of the Baroda Commission. Suffice it to say that they pronounced Mulhar Rao's personal character and conduct during his brief reign of three years to have been pre-eminently sweeping, vindictive, violent and spoliatory towards all classes of his subjects, including the higher ones; and consequently that he was not a Prince who could be reasonably expected to reform existing abuses, and to place the administration of the State on a footing to entitle it to the confidence and support of the British Government, and the loyal and willing obedience of all its subjects. 20. In my Progress Report to Government, No. 361-1225, dated the 2nd N ovember instant, I gave a full account of the official administration of the State from the departure of the Commission to that date, but I excluded from that report certain personal matters, which it now becomes my duty to relate, in order to throw light upon the conduct of the Maharaja and his personal Agents towards myself as Resident for the last 16 months and upwards. 21. I arrived at Baroda on the 18th March 1873, and within about four months from that time secret overtures were made to me through the medium of an old banker, purporting to come from Mulhar Rao himself, and enquiring what my price was. I merely sent backward to say that what I wished to accomplish was His Highness' own welfare and that of his subjects, and that if I could effect that 1 should be well paid. From that moment up to the present I have about once or twice a month been in the habit of receiving letters con taining threats of various kinds, most of them with the object of causing me to refrain from systematically reporting to Government everything that was going on, and to desist from making references to the Durbar on unpleasant subjects under the pain of being killed either by sorcery, poison, or shooting—the same specials means, it will be remembered, as were actually used in 1863 to com pass the death of His Highness Khunde Rao. 22. I have only kept a few of the letters to which I refer, but I may state generally that in August 1873, when it became my disagreeable duty to noiace certain cases which reflected upon the personal character of the Maha raja, Nana Saheb Khanvilkur and others of the old administration, and again in the two following months when the number of petitioners greatly increased, 4 Exd.—R. T. B.and again in March 1874, when about to proceed to Nowsaree with His Highness the Maharaja, the threats and manifestations of the personal feeling to which I refer, were frequent and virulent, though there was no difference in the per sonal bearing of ilis Highness towards me and has not been up to about a month ago. 23. During the early part of this period which may be termed the sorcery stage of Mulhar llao's insults and threats, a Delhi Hakim in the service of His Highness was going about Baroda with a middle-sized magic bottle in which my name was written both in English and Persian characters. However absurd this proceeding may appear, it should be remembered that it was done for the benelit of a public who have the most profound belief in magic; and I have no doubt whatever that this magical performance was exhibited in order to show that the Resident was in the hands of the Maharaja's magicians; indeed none in His Highness' service would have dared to have acted in such a public manner towards the Resident without the Maharaja's instigation or consent. His Highness himself conversed with me on the subject of this magic bottle on one or two occasions, and I clearly remember his asking how it was possible that a written inscription could have been made inside such a narrow necked bottle except by magic (Jadoo). Taking this in conjunction with the unsatis factory state of affairs and the threats of sorcery being used against one which I was then receiving, I could not but feel that the object in view was to inti midate and insult me, but I allowed the matter to pass with little or no remark. * . i -t ■, 24. Next in order to this occurrence came the contempt and ridicule which were thrown upon the Members of the Commission and the Resident in a dramatic performance which took place before His Highness the Maharaja in January 1874, as already reported to Government. 25. On our arrival at Nowsaree at the end of March 1874 I did not fail to remark that the Maharaja posted his confidential Arab servant, Salam, Madho Rao Kalay and others of his household as spies close to the house in which I resided. I was at the same time anonymously warned against the presence of these men as dangerous. On the day that under the orders of Government I refused to attend Luxmee Race's marriage (7th May) the Delhi Hakim above referred to appeared again with the magic bottle, and I was afterwards told that he actually came to my bungalow with it. What ever his object may have been, it was a sinister one, calculated to throw contempt upon the Government of which I was the representative, and had I seen the Hakim, I should most certainly have instituted an enquiry into the matter. I was separately warned of this Hakim's proceedings on this occasion in an anonymous letter. 20. A day or two after this, Mr. Dadabhai Now^rojee made his false and malicious attack upon me in the khureeta of the 9th May to the address of His Excellency the Governor; and I again received a long anonymous letter informing me of the measures that were being adopted by the Maharaja to destrov both my native Assistant Mr. Manibhai and myself. It was stated in that letter that I was to be poisoned by my bottler, meaning no doubt the Chobdar and table servant Faizoo, who, however, had been fortunately left behind at Baroda to take care of the Residency: consequently no attempt to poison me was made at Nowsaree. I, however, cautioned my bottler (a Portuguese) who is strictly honest and trustworthy and has served me for 25 years, not to allow the Arab sowar Salam or any of Ilis Highness' servants to come near the cook-room under any pretence whatever. I now feel assured that had the table ser vant Faizoo been at Nowsaree at that time, an attempt would have been made to poison me in consequence of the ungovernable rage of the Gaekwar at the non-recognition by Government of his marriage with Luxmee Baee. 27. At the end of May 1874, we returned to Baroda, where the same system * of persecution and insult continued. I have more than once been solicited by prominent members of the Durbar to disobey Government ^ 3orders privately, in order that the Maharaja's wishes might be gratified at the expense of the advice given by Government. About that time (July 1874) an anonymous threatening letter was forwarded to me by Mr. Aitehison, the Foreign Secretary, for my information, which appeared to me to emanate from the same general source as all the other letters of a similar character, and to which I replied, saying that I had received many others of a similar kind for many months, and expressing the opinion that His Higliness the Gaekwar would doubtless be very glad to assassinate me if he dared, but that I considered him too great a coward to go to such a length. The recent attempt, however, on my life shows that my estimate was a mistaken one. 28. On the 3rd August the khureeta of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, dated 25th July 1874, was delivered by me to His Highness the Gaekwar, and as that khureeta conveyed Uie most kind but serious warn ings to His Uighness, it is necessary to mark particularly His Highness' per sonal conduct between that time and the present, in order to form an opinion whether there is any reasonable hope of a truly reformed administration being effected under a Ruler of his well-known character as above pourtrayed. 29. One of the first personal measures of His Highness after the receipt of the khureeta was the organization of extensive arrangements for bribing British Government officials, in the hope of getting rid of the Resident and of thereby delaying the substantial reform which had been so strongly inculcated in the khureeta. Nominal assent on paper was indeed given to the greater part of the advice tendered; but at the same tihie the secret intrigues and mal practices of the Maharaja were pushed forward with greater vigour than ever. All attempts at reform on the mahals were deliberately frustrated, an active system of retaliation on Commission complainants was kept up, and the outcry from all classes in the State continued as strongly as ever—a state of affairs which led to a series of written remonstrances addressed by me to His Highness under orders from Government. 30. On the 5th and 12th October 1874 I was instructed demi-officially by Demi-official letter from the Hon'- Government to make very unpleasant and humiliat- bie Mr. Gibbs, dated ist October, to ing communications to His Highness regarding his Se- conduct in the Premchund Roychund bribery in- cretary to His Excellency the Governor, trigUC, which, instead of leading him to desist from dated 9th October 1874. I'T xii iti i i* i.* his disreputable and disloyal machinations, appear from what has since taken place to have exasperated him more than ever against me under the supposition that I had first informed Government of this intrigue whereas the contrary is the case. 31. On the 14th October the serious dispute with the Sirdar Chandra Rao See the list of corrcspomiencequoted 1 &gt; U(1 ? 0 arose which threatened, unless speedily in paragraph 68 of my Progress Report cheeked, to end in a military rCVOlt. On tllC 19th Nove™i874. No ' 361 ' 1225 of 2nd idem the day before the Dussera, such was the utter inability of the new administration to influence His Highness for good that no effectual measure had up to that date been adopted to arrange matters; and it was only when, with the sanction of Government, I intimated the impossibility of my attending the Dussera procession, unless matters were arranged, that His Highness abandoned his revengeful designs upon the Sirdars in question. 32. In the meantime (16th October) Luxmee Baee gave birth to a son, and Tide correspondence ending with ^ Solicit prominent attention to tllC fact that pi'C- Govemment telegram, 27th October cisely as the non-recognition by Government of ^ , her marriage in May last was followed bv a false and malicious attack on me in a khureeta, so on the birth of her son, his delaved recognition by Government as the legal heir to the guddee drew forth another lalse and malicious attack on me in the khureeta, dated 2nd November, instant, ac icssed to His Lxcellency the Viceroy and Governor-General. These and 0 f l f] 1 ' at am ' es 0 , f a Sl milar kind plainly indicate the real and systematic nature ot the Maharaja s enmity to me personally as British Representative at his 67 Court; and I have heard that His Highness considers his honor and dignity to have been particularly injured hy the action of Government in these cases. 33. From the moment that the last khureeta of 2nd November was written, ITis Uiglmess appears to have become desperate. On Thursday, the 5th November, it again became my duty to speak to His Highness about the fur ther prosecution of the Premchund Roychund intrigue, the alleged resignation of Mr. Dadabhai, &amp;c., &amp;c., as reported by me to His Excellency the Governor demi-officially on the 5th November 1874. I explained to His Highness fully the deceitful part which his personal Agent Motiram had played, and 1 cau tioned him in friendly terms against the danger of such intrigues. Next day, (Friday, the 6th November) I felt sick at stomach with a strange confused feel ing in my head, but I struggled against it and entertained no suspicion what ever of foul play. Next day, Saturday, the 7th November, I felt rather worse, but recovered on Sunday, the 8th. After taking a little sherbet, however on the morn ing of Monday, the 9th instant, I discovered, as described elsewhere in the evidence, that at last the diabolical threats to poison me had been carried into execution, but had providentially failed. 34. I have thus briefly traced a series of facts bearing upon Mulhar Rao personal career from 1857 up to the present time, in order to show how con sistently the secret conspirator of the years 1857, 1863, and 1867, the would- be murderer of Serjeant Major Higgins and of the Ex-Ranee Jumna Race and Her Highness Rukma Raee and the alleged actual murderer of the five others named in this report, has at length through his secret Agents crowned his career of crime by a course of misgovernment almost unparalleled in this part of India, and by an ill-disguised attempt to murder a British Resident who dared to expose that misgovernment and to oppose an effectual check to his more open exhibitions of heinous crimes. 35. The systematic persecution which I have attempted to describe above as having been practised towards myself when in the performance of my public duty at the Court of Raroda; though a most humiliating and disgraceful fact is unfortunately no new feature in Raroda politics, since the time that the present Gackwar's father Syajee Rao was first entrusted with conditional inde pendence by the Hon'ble Mountstuart Elphinstone in 1820. 36. In connection with this subject I would invite the attention of Gov ernment to the measures resorted to by Syajee Rao to effect the destruc- Within the last is months i have tion of Mr. Williams, the then Rritish represen- more than once been informed of tative, and of certain obnoxious members of his own similar human sacrifices liaving taken /&gt;'ii _ i -n i • jj * place near Baroda, hut i found it im- family by sorcery, human sacrifices, and maantations, possible to obtain proof of them. Minute by the Hon'ble Mr. Newnham, dated 26th January 1830. 37. With regard to the energetic Resident, Mr. Sutherland, who died suddenly in 1840 at a well-known critical period of Syajee's career, the belief is universally prevalent in Baroda that he was killed by sorcery and poison; and his fate has more than once been held out as a threat to me in anony mous letters. 38. With regard to the distinguished Colonel Outram, when engaged in exposing the malpractices of the Baroda Durbar towards the close of Syajee's reign, distinct allusion has been officially made by him to an attempt of the Maharaja's Agents to poison him; and it is notorious that he remained for a con siderable time under the apprehension that poisoned food would some how or other be administered to him. 39. It thus appears that every Resident who has been placed in excep tionally difficult circumstances, as I have been, and has attempted fearlessly and impartially to do his duty, has been systematically exposed to positive personal danger. That danger, however, has incalculably increasedowing to the exceptionally vindictive character of the present Maharaja and the pregnancy of the fresh complications created by his own outrageous and self-willed misconduct. Thus the causes of disagreement between the two Governments have at length attained a magnitude and vitality of importance which are unparalleled even in the history of our relations with the present Maharaja's father, Syajee, who though he gave more trouble than any of the previous Gaekwars has been far surpassed in crime by his sod , Mulhar Rao. 40. For instance, even since His Highness received His Excellency the Governor-General's warning on the 3rd August last, instead of listening to that warning as he promised to do, he has deliberately committed the following acts of disloyalty and misrule :— 1st. —Retaliation on complainants before the Commission notwithstanding the Proclamation issued for their protection. 2ndly. —The Premchund Eoychund bribery intrigue undertaken to secure the removal of the Resident from his Court, and to obtain certain political advantages by disloyal and insulting means. Srdly. —His repeated importunities regarding additional military honors to Nana Saheb Khanvilkar, well knowing that such honors were utterly incompatible with the authoritative advice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, which he professed to follow. To this may be added his frequent importunities for military honors to Luxmee Baee. kthlij. —His false and malicious attack on the Resident in the khureeta of 2nd November last. hthly, and lastly.—His final attempt to get rid of the Resident by poison on the 9th November instant, and his general demeanour in connection there with since that time. 41. Under these circumstances, I respectfully submit that neither the honor or interests of the British Government, or the welfare of the two and a half millions of the Baroda State are safe under a Prince who, in spite of all the warnings which he has had since the close of 1872, a period of two years and upwards, continues deliberately to set the common principles of humanity, loyalty, and justice at defiance; and I therefore, as British repr sentative at this Court, where I am in a position to prove my personal conduct and general bearing towards His Highness the Gaekwar to have been marked by kindness and forbearance, claim the substantial protection of Government on behalf of the general interests which arc at stake, which interests, I feel assured, will not be promoted by the least concession to a Prince who from 1857 to the present time appears from the evidence recorded to have had his own way, however opposed to the laws that regulate all political and social relations in every part of the world. 42. In conclusion I have the honor to state that, although the recent attempt on my life has failed, I have reasonable grounds for believing that those who were induced in the Maharaja's interest to compass that attempt have not abandoned their intentions. I have observed myself and have been also warned that my steps after dark are dogged by spies; and the presence of suspicious persons in parts of camp, where they can have no ordinary business, has been brought to my notice. I have also received by post some friendly letters coun selling the utmost vigilance and forethought. For these warnings I believe there is at the present time ample ground, and I leave it for Government to decide to what extent they think that a Representative of their own should be exposed to them at the Court of a Prince who is known to be one of the most revengeful and malicious in India, and for whose acts he has been hitherto held irresponsible on the grounds that he was of deficient intellect. 8 Exd.—R. T. B.Appendix A. Statement by C olonel P hayre , Resident, dated 9th November 1874. O n Monday, 9th November 1874, I went out for my morning exercise as usual at a little before 6 a.m ., and returned at five minutes to 7 as shown by the clock above my table. I went to the wash-hand-stand table on which a glass of pummelo sherbet is usually placed, and after taking two or three sips of it I sat down at my writing table and commenced writing. In about 20 minutes or half an hour I felt sick at stomach, and at once attributed it to the sherbet, which I then thought must have been made with a bad pummelo. I then got up and took the tumbler of sherbet in my hand and threw nearly all its contents through the window. Whilst putting down the tumbler, however, upon the table, and feeling at the same time my head rather confused and dizzy, I observed some dark sediment at the bottom of the tumbler. This struck me as very extraordinary, and for the first time the idea occurred to me that the sherbet in question had been poisoned. I at once wrote a note to the Hesidency Surgeon, Dr. Seward, and asked him to come over to me. He arrived in about half an hour when I showed him the tumbler and its contents, and described the sensation which I was at that moment undergoing. He sug gested that I should take an emetic, but I replied that I had not taken suffi cient to seriously injure me, and that I did not wish to upset myself for the whole day as I had plenty of work to do. I at the same time mentioned to him that I had for some days previously had doubts about the good quality of the pummelos used for making the sherbet, as I had on some days thrown it all away, and on others after drinking a little had experienced much the same sensations as I was then suffering from. Dr. Seward took the tumbler away with him, and said that he would analyse the contents. Dr. Seward returned about noon saying that he had analysed the contents, and from the clearness of the indications had no doubt whatever of the presence of arsenic. I had in the interim written to him asking him to give me his professional opinion in writing regarding the nature of the contents of the tumbler. My note to Dr. Seward had not reached him at this time, but a few minutes afterwards it arrived, and having read it he wrote the professional opinion asked for. Under these cir cumstances, I at once commenced a strict enquiry, and the first point to which I directed attention was to procure a list of those persons who had had access to my private office room between about 6 a.m . and five minutes to 7 a.m. this morning. The results of this enquiry are annexed. Statement by A. C. B oevey , Esq., Assistant Resident, dated 9th November 1874. O n Monday morning, 9th November, I went out shooting about 7 a.m., and returned about 8-30. On my return to the Residency I was accosted by Eshwant Rao Jassood, Salam, the Maharaja's Arab Sowar, and by Madho Rao Sowar, who presented to me the usual fruit, &amp;c., with the Maharaja's compli ments. As I rode up to the door I saw Faizoo Chobdar in the verandah talking with Salam. Several peons and others were present at the same time. The following witnesses w T ere called by the Resident and examined:— 1.— N ursoo , Jemadar of Peons on the Residency Establishment, states;— I came on duty to the Resident's this morning at 7-30 a.m ., after the Resident's return from his walk. The Resident was in his room when I arrived. Before me, this 9th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayhe, Col., Resident, 9 32. —Rowjee ., Havildar of Peons on tbe Residency Establishment, states :— I was present at the Resident's room when Abdoolla placed the pumraelo juice on the Resident's table. I cleared the waste paper basket in the Resident's room before his return, and was on duty when he returned this morning. Before me, this 9th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. 3.—Govind Baloo , Hamal, states:— I cleared the Resident's private room this morning with Yellapa Ilamal. It is my duty to.arrange the things, and Yellapa sweeps the room. While I was employed with Yellapa, Abdoolla brought pummelo juice. (On being further questioned the witness denied that this morning any pummelo juice was brought by Abdoolla.) I saw no pummelo juice brought to-day. I left the Resident's room about 7 o'clock. Yellapa cleaned the room with me, and after wards left before me. Rowjee Havildar came into the room while I was there to collect the waste paper by the writing table. Luxmon, Puttewalla, also came into the room before Rowjee. Before me, this 9th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. 4.— Yellapa , Hamal, states :— I swept the Resident's private office room this morning. Abdoolla and Govind were present while I was sweeping it. Abdoolla came to arrange the Sahib's things. I did not see him bring anything. He usually brings some pummelo juice in a tumbler. Abdoolla always places the juice on the wash-hand stand table. I did not see him place it there to-day. Before me, this 9th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. —Abdoolla , Residency Chobdar, states :— I placed a tumbler of pummelo juice for the Sahib this morning as usual. I placed the juice on the wash-hand-stand table about 6-30 a. m . At that time Han. s ^vind Baloo and Yellapa were in the room. Rowjee Havildar was m his usual place ; he did not come into tbe room while I was there. I 2Jlaced the juice and went away. hen I left, the two Hamals and Luxmon were m the room, and the Havildar Rowjee was in the ante-room. TVith reference to tho statement of Govind and Yellapa Hamals that they saw me bring no pummelo juice as usual, that is untrue. Both of them were present and saw me place the juice on the table as usual. Luxmon peon came into the room to so the papers, &amp;c., in order. I saw no other peon come in except Luxmon. um joe w as arranging papers in the ante-room ; he did not come into the private oitice room while 1 was present. 10 Before me, this 9th day of November 1874.

Lefore me, this 9th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. 7-— F aizoo, Chobdar, states :— I i)] n not go to the Resident's private office room this morning. I returned from the city this morning about 7 o'clock, and went to clean the sin cr as usual. No one was then engaged in cleaning the silver. I saw Pedro at the cook-room on my return. He was not going to the bazaar. Before me, this 9th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. I t appears from the evidence of these witnesses that the following persons only are known to have had access to the Resident's private office room on the morning of Monday, November 9th, 1874, between the time that the Resident went out for his private exercise about 6 a.m . and % returned about 6-55 : 1. Abdo lla, Chobdar. 2. Rowjee, Ilavildar of Peons. 3. Govind Baloo, Hamal. 4. Yellapa, Hnmal. 5. Luxmon, Peon. Abdoolla made the sherbet, and placed it on the Resident's table about 6-30 on the morning in question. He has been in my service on and off for the last 18 years, bears the highest character, and is strongly attached to me and to my family. I do not suspect him of any complicity in the crime now under investigation. He has given his evidence in the most straightforward and honest manner, and I am satisfied that tjie poison must have been put into the pummelo sherbet after Abdoolla had left the room after placing it on the table, and before my return from exercise about 7 a.m. When Abdoolla left the room about 6-30, the following persons are stated by him to have been present in the room :— 1. Govind Baloo, Hamal. 2. Yellapa, Hamal. 3. Luxmon, Peon. Rowjee Havildar also admits that he w T as present near the Resident's room when Abdoolla brought the pummelo juice, and that he afterwards cleared out the waste paper basket in the room. Ordered that the four persons above named be arrested and placed in con finement pending further enquiry. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., 9//i November 1874.

He also has been in the habit of going to the Kazee in the city, and the Kazee used to visit him here. I should have mentioned this; but he used to come to visit the Padree Sahib, so I said nothing. Q.—Who do you suspect of having attempted to administer poison to the Sahib ? A.—I suspect Faizoo, because he has for a long time past been engaged in all kinds of intrigues both in the time of Colonel Barr and Colonel Shortt. In Colonel Shortt's time he used to go with Colonel Shortt's butler to the house of Rahoorkur, Nana Sahib, and others for the purpose of giving them information. I have myself seen Paizoo go with Colonel Shortt's butler and others to the city for this purpose. Before me, this 11th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. Faizoo Rumzan , Mussulman, aged about 45, Chobdar and table-servant. Residency Establish ment, Baroda;— I was first employed at Baroda by Major Malcolm, Resident, as second servant, and was made chobdar by Colonel Davidson, Resident, about 20 years ago, and I have acted as table -servant as well from that time to the present. When Colonel Wallace left, I obtained a place in the Khas Paga on Rupees 10 per mensem, continuing, however, to act as chobdar and table-servant at the Residency. The Durbar service was in the name of my son, who is now 14} years old. I have received that amount up to the present time. I live in the city, and come every day for duty. I have a room in the Residency compound. My family lives in the city. Q.—Where are you in the habit of sleeping ? A.—I usually sleep in the Residency, but I go home to sleep every third or fourth day.q . What is the name of the Mussulman who has been in the habit of visiting you at the Residency lately ? A. He is called Kazee Dada Meeya. I do not know his father's name. Kazee Dada Meeya lives in the city near the lines of one of the regiments. He only used to visit me when the Rev. Mr. Taylor came to the Residency whom he used to visit. I do not know whether he is in the Maharaja's service or not. I did not know him before he used to come here to visit Mr. Taylor. I do not know why he first came to me instead of going to the Padree Saheb direct. I know nothing about him except in connection with his visit to the Padree. I am acquainted with Salam, an Arab Sowar, a private servant of the Maharaja. 1 have known him since the present Maharaja's time. Salam has never come to my room in the Residency to sit, nor has he ever smoked with me. He did not come to my room on Monday last, the 9th, about 9 a.m . I saw him in the adjoining room to mine on Monday last about 9-30 a.m . He called out to me, and I said that it was near breakfast time, and that I was changing my clothes. Salam then left, no further conversation passed between us on the morning in question. Q.—Do you remember seeing the Assistant Resident return from shooting at about 8-30 a.m . on the morning of Monday, the 9th instant, in question, and were you not at that time sitting on the bench and talking to the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam ? A.—I did not see the Assistant Resident, and I was not talking to Salam. Salam has never come to my house in the city. I have never seen Salam talking with the old man Govind Baloo, who cleans out the Resident's private office. When my boxes were searched on Monday, the 9th instant. Government Rupees 100 were found in one of them. I usually keep my money in the city where my family is. Q.—Do any other persons from the city except the Kazee above referred to and Salam ever come to your quarters at the Residency ? . A.—No one has ever come from the city to visit me. Q.—If as you say the Arab Sowar Salam has never been in the habit of visiting your quarters at the Residency, how came he to come to your quarters and call out to you on Monday, the 9th instant ? A.—1 cannot say why he came. Q.—Do you ever go to the quarters of the old Hamal Govind ? A.—I never go, and I have never sat smoking outside with him, in passing I have enquired about his wife. Q,.—Do you know how Govind Baloo came to put poison in my sherbet on the morning of Monday, the 9th ? A.—I did not see him do it, how can I tell. I slept at the city on Sunday night, and returned to duty about 7 a.m . on Monday, the 9th. I slept on Friday night, the 6th instant, in the city. Witness corrects himself and states that on Friday night he slept in the Residency. I also slept at the Residency on Thursday and Saturday night last. Q.—Have you ever made pummelo sherbert for the Resident ? A.—les, I have, when Abdoolla has not made it. I may have made it with in the last week or ten days. I have never brought it to the Resident's room myself. There was no special reason for my not bringing it. I may have made the sherbet last Friday. I never put sugar into the sherbet. 16 Exd.—J. D. G.The above examination has been read over to the witness in Hindostanee, a language which he understands, and has been acknowledged to be correct. Wth November 1874. Before me. (Sd.) E. P hayre, Col., Resident. T he examination of Faizoo Ramzan having been recorded, he is ordered to be placed in confinement pending further enquiry. (Sd.) R. P hayre, C o/., Wth November 1874. Resident. Pedro DeSotjza ., Portuguese, age about 37 years, Butler in the service of Colonel R. Phayre, C.B., Resident:— I have been in the service of Colonel Phayre about 25 years, and I accom- 'panied him to Baroda. I went on leave to Goa on the 3rd October last, and returned again on November 3rd. Salam, Arab Sowar of the Maharaja, has been in the habit of going to the servants' quarters. When he comes he usually goes to Faizoo's room, and sits outside in the verandah. Next to Faizoo's room is the ayah's room, and a dwarf wall divides those two rooms from mine. I have never seen him sit any where else. Since 1 came from leave on the 3rd instant, I have seen Salam twice. On Monday last, the 9th instant, I saw him sitting as usual outside Faizoo's room in the verandah. I did not see whether Faizoo was there or not. At that time the Maharaja had not arrived, it was about 9 o'clock. I was then employed in plucking some quail that had just been brought in. I have also seen a man whom they call Kazee go to Faizoo's room. I do not know who the Kazee is, but he used to come to see the Jlev. Mr. Taylor. He used also to come at other times. He has been in the habit of coming to Faizoo's room and sitting there for long periods together. He usually comes on horseback and wears a white turban tightly bound. No other jasoods or personal servants of the Maharaja ever go to the servants' quarters. I have not seen any other people from the city go to Faizoo's quarters. I have been solicited by Nur Ollah, former Chobdar, to go down to the city to the Maharaja's Palace. I told my master of it at the time, and Nur Ollah was discharged. Since that I have not been solicited by any one. Faizoo sleeps as often in the city as he does here. I suspected Faizoo of bein'' concerned in the matter of administering poison to the Resident, because of Ins connection with the city, his intimacy with Salam, and others who live in the citv. He also sometimes makes the sherbet and has access at all times to the Resident's private office room. He is also in the pay of the Durbar. Govind Baloo, the old Hamal, who looks after the Resident's private office, dressing table, bathing water, &amp;c., always shuts up the Resident's room the last thin'- at night, and goes off to his room to sleep. Faizoo or Abdoolla who ever mav be on duty, leaves the bungalow about the same time. Throughout the whole day, also except during meal time, Faizoo and Govind are always present on duty in the Residency. This examination having been read over to the witness in Hindostanee, a language which he understands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Before me, this 11th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. 17 5Anton John DeSouza , Portuguese, aged about 24) years, cook to Colonel R. Resident:— Phayre, C.B., I have been employed in Colonel Phayre's service as cook for the last seven or eight years and I accompanied him to Baroda. The Maharaja's Arab sowar Salam is in the habit of coming to Faizoo's quarters twice in the week when the Maharaja visits the Resident. I know this because the cookroom is opposite those quarters and I can see what goes on. I have also seen him come at other times on special occasions and he then always goes to Faizoo's room. I have also seen a person called Kazee who always goes to Faizoo's and who visits the Rev. Mr. Taylor when he comes to Baroda. I have also seen the Kazee referred to a great many times when Mr. Taylor was not at Baroda. 1 have once enquired of Faizoo why this Kazee always come. Faizoo replied that he came to get news of Mr. Taylor. The Kazee however stayed a long time at each visit, much longer than was necessary to make such enquiries. I cannot say positively whether the Kazee came last week or not when Mr. Taylor was here. Other persons also have come from the city to visit Faizoo, but I do not' know them. On Monday, the 9th instant, I saw Salam as usual outside Faizoo's quarters. No one ever comes into the cookroom. No one has ever made any overtures to me about going to the city or anything else. Faizoo usually sleeps in the city but sometimes sleeps here. On one occasion Pedro asked him why he went to the city so often, and Faizoo got angry and said that he never left without telling Abdoolla. I suspect Faizoo's complicity in the crime of administering poison because he receives pay from the Durbar and has been mixed up in Baroda intrigues for a long time past and is always enquiring about the Sahib to give information in the city. Ahdoolla and I had lately an altercation with him about this*; and another reason is the visits that are constantly paid to him by the Arab Sowar Salam, the Kazee, and others from the city who have no buisiness there at all. The above examination having been read over to the witness in Hindos- tanee, a language which he understands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Before me, this 11th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col., Resident. Abdoolla Mahomed , Mussulman, age about 35, Chobdar and table servant: •* I have been of and on in Colonel Phayre's service for 18 years. I came to Baroda with Colonel Phayre and was made Chobdar in the place of Nur a , who was discharged. I have the highest certificates of character from my master and others whom I have served for the above period. Question. Have you ever had anything to complain of since you have been in my service ? ^ o r ^ Answer.—Fw from it, I have been treated as a child of the family b )th V t mi f r ?, ss - 1 am in the habit of making pummelo sherbet for pi m i made it on the morning of Monday, November 9th. Faizoo Chobdar has occasionally made it, and he made it, I believe on Friday last. hmzoo has on more than one occasion brought the sherbet himself and put it on19 the hahib s tiil)le, but I put it there on the moruin? of Monday the 9th When my child died Faizoo prepared the sherbet for about 12 days runnins This was about three months ago. I UQnm g- I 1 ) iave 1 ^ aow,1 . the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam since I came to Baroda • when the Maharaja comes to visit at the Residency twice a week Salam Kfr he goes inside and , , T ., . . — LKJVIU, uc^auac x vvus UL WOIK 111 Ulft unga ow. I saw the Assistant Kesident return from shooting about 8-30 on m morning, and then Salam and two other Mahratta Jasoods of the ^ a lamja were talking together with Faizoo in the Residency back verandah. f • h( - n tl1 ® ^ adam Sahib was leaving for England, she gave me and Pedro ^ riC i T-, ^ • l ri0 one }ut oursel ves were to prepare the tea, coffee, &amp;c., for le ba n ). raizoo, however, on several occasions has endeavoured in a marked manner to forestall us in this respect. Both I and Pedro in consequence of oar orders, have frequently remonstrated with Faizoo about this, but he has alwavs put us olr, and has not attended. I have never suspected that there was anv special motive on Faizoo's part for doinn- this. *6 I have always used the best pummelo for extracting the juice, and on one or t\\ o occasions about a month or two ago I have brought bad pummelos to show. r i he pummelo that I used on the morning of the 9th was perfectlv fresh and in good condition. I showed it to Dr. Seward. I could not understand whv the Sahib complained two or three mornings previously that the juice was bad. Iso suspicion crossed my mind that any one had drugged it. It was my custom to place it on the wash-hand-stand table about half-past 6, when I went to my regular work. At that time the old Hamal Govind and another used to be in the room, and the peons as usual were arranging the papers, pens, ink, &amp;c. It was therefore perfectly possible for any one to have put something into the sherbet after any departure, and before the Sahib's arrival. Eaizoo's business is to clean the silver and lay the breakfast table. The breakfast room is only about 15 paces from the Sahib's private office in line with it, and had Eaizoo come in from the breakfast room into the private office by the back entrance, no one could have seen him unless they had been engaged in the room at the time. On Monday morning, the 9th instant, Faizoo returned from the city about 6-30 before the Sahib had returned from his walk. I know this because the Sahib's horse always passes the dispense-khana where 1 am at work. I therefore know exactly the time when he comes. When I had placed the juice on the Sahib's table as usual, I went to the dispense-khana to prepare the butter and then I saw Faizoo on his way to the dispense-khana. Faizoo then went into the dining-room. I cannot say whether he went to the Sahib's room or not, but he might have gone without*my knowing. I have constantly seen the Kazee at Faizoo's room both when Mr. Taylor was here and when he was not. I have enquired from Faizoo what the Kazee came for and was always informed that he came to enquire after Mr. Taylor. This examination having been read over to the witness in Hindostanee, a language he understands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Before me, this 11th day of November 1874. (Sd.) E. P hayre, Col., Resident.Nursoo Rajarao , Jemadar of Peons, Residency Establishment, Komatee, age about 50, Baroda, states:— I have served in the K/esidency about 31 years. I was made Jemadar after Major Malcolm's death by Captain Barton about 16 years ago. I am acquainted with the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam. 'When the Ex-Ranee, Jumna Baee, was residing at the Residency for her confinement, Salam was employed by the Maharaja to keep watch over the Residency and to give him information of everything that went on. At that time Paizoo was on very intimate terms with Salam, and has continued so up to the present time. In the time of Colonel Shortt Paizoo was on very intimate terms with Colonel Shortt's butler, and they used to visit the city and go to Nana Sahib Dewan, Bulwunt Rao Esbwunt, and also to Rahoukur. They were also accompanied by Doolubh, Naik of peons in the Residency Establishment, and by his two brothers. Maun Sing and Prem Sing, all of whom were last year expelled from the cantonment, but now reside in the city. Paizoo was on very intimate terms with all of these persons, and used to accompany them to the city. Paizoo was engaged in all sorts of intrigues during the whole time that Colonel Shortt was here. I am acquainted with a Mussulman Kazee, who was on very intimate terms with Paizoo, and who used to come to Mr. Taylor. He often came to Paizoo's quarters when Mr. Taylor was not in Baroda. When the Resident was at Nousaree in March last with the Maharaja, Salam did not live with the Maharaja in the town of Nousaree, but he lived in the compound of the bungalow occupied by the Resident. I know that Sahim is a dangerous man, because in Colonel Shortt's time he was employed with Paizoo to seize the karkoons of Rahukur, who were in Colonel Shortt's butler's room at the Residency, The facts of the case were very notorious and made much sensation at the time. When this occurred Salam was as now the confidential servant of the Maharaja. Since Colonel Phayre became Resident, I do not know whether Paizoo has been engaged in any intrigue like that above described, but I do know that he continues to be on very intimate terms with Salam, and that he is always enquiring what goes on, and resides chiefly in the city. I reside in the city, and I come on duty every day between 7-30 and 8 o'clock. In the time of the Ranee Jumna Baee's residence at the Residency, I incurred the present Maharaja's displeasure, because I refused to allow access to his men as he wished. That displeasure has never been removed. Two of my brothers were turned out of the service, one was Subadar-Major of Irregular Cavalry, and the other was a Havildar. Pensions, however, were granted subsequently at the Resident's intercession. I am considered by the Maharaja as an enemy, and no overtures of any kind have been made to me. In connection with the attempt to poison the Resident, my suspicion falls on Paizoo for the reasons already disclosed. The old Hamal Govind, I believe, to be incapable of such a crime. I have never heard of Govind going about any where, or of his being engaged in any intrigue. Paizoo knows Govind well, and has plenty of opportunities of talking to him. ihis examination was read over to the witness in Guzerattee, a language which he understands, and was acknowledged by him to be correct.

G.&lt; tovind Baloo , Hamal^ aged about 50 years, is in custody, and is recalled and further examined:— Question.—State precisely what are your duties in the Resident's private office room every morning ? Answer.—The IJamals sweep the room first, and then I clean the tables, chairs, &amp;c., empty the basin, bring fresh water in the kooja. I arrange the bath room which adjoins the private office, and see that bathing water, &amp;c., is ready. Q-—Who is in the habit of bringing the sherbet that I drink ? A.—Abdoolla usually brings it, but Eaizoo sometimes brings it. It is not always brought whilst I am in the room. Q'—W ho brought the sherbet on the morning of the 9th, Monday ? A.—I did not see the sherbet at all. Q*—Did not Abdoolla on that morning bring the sherbet ? A.—I did not see him bring it. Q.—Could any one have brought the sherbet without your knowledge ? A.—Yes, when I went into the dining-room it could have been brought. Q.—Did you see Eaizoo at all on the morning of the 9th ? A.—No, I may have seen him, but I do not recollect. Q-—Y ou clean the wash-hand stand table, and you say you did not see the sherbet on Monday, the 9th instant. Do you usually see it there ? A.—I always see it there, but I did not see it on the morning in question. Q-—Did you see Abdoolla in the private office room on Monday, the 9th ? A.—I saw Abdoolla, but he had no sherbet with him. Q-—Y ou have said above that some times Abdoolla brings the sherbet and some times Eaizoo. Did you ever see Eaizoo bring it ? A.—(After much prevarication the witness declines to acknowledge that he ever saw Eaizoo bring any sherbet to the Resident's room. The witness shows a marked disinclination to say anything whatever about Eaizoo.) Q.—How many years have you been employed at the Residency ? A.—About six or seven years. Q.—Do you know the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam ? A.—I know him by sight, but I have never had anything to say to him. He usually comes with the Maharaja. Q.—Have you ever seen Salam at Eaizoo's quarters ? A.—Yes, I have. Q.—Has the Resident ever injured or offended you in any way ? A.—No, not in the least. Before me this 12th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre, Col. t Resident. Mahomed Ahmed , Mussulman, age about 50, Bhistee, Baroda Residency, states:— I live in the Residency compound next to the old Hamal Govind Baloo. I have been employed at the Residency since the time of Mr. Andrews, Acting Resident, about 25 years ago. Govind Baloo lives in the next room with his wife. No one else lives with him. I know Salam the Maharaja's Arab Sowar. He always goes to Eaizoo's room, and sits there. I have seen Eaizoo go and talk to the old Hamal 21 622 Baloo Govind outside his room. I bave not seen him go there for the last mouth. I cannot say whether he goes there or not at night. This examination having been read over to the witness in Hindoostanee, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Runchod Rutna Pcrwaree , age about 21 years, Mussul on the Residency Establishment, states:— I remember seeing Abdoolla on the morning of Monday, the 9th, at about 6-30 ; he came into the dispense khana to prepare the butter as usual. I was cleaning the candle-sticks, &amp;c., as usual. I know the time because the Sahib's horse came a long time afterwards about 7 o'clock. I saw Faizoo come into the dispense khana shortly after Abdoolla came there. Faizoo went from there to the dining-room. The dining-room was not ready at that time for the table to be laid. The hamals never go into the dining-room so early as 6-30.

I have seen the Maharaja's Arab Sowar named Salam come to the servants' quarters. He usually goes to Faizoo's room and there sits and talks with him. I only remember seeing Salam when the Maharaja's sowaree comes. Salam alone of the Maharaja's private attendants has been in the habit of going to the servants' quarters. I have seen Faizoo sometimes preparing sherbut for the Resident. I re- n^ember that he prepared it one day lately, but I am not quite sure as to the exact day. * *• I have seen a Mussulman who is called the 'Kazee' come to Faizoo's quarters on several occasions, and have seen him sit and talk with him. I do not know what the Kazee's name is, or what he comes for. I have been in the service of my present master about five years.

My room is at the back of the ayah's room. I know the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam. He comes with the Maharaja's sowaree and usually goes to Eaizoo's room, and sits and talks with him. I also have seen a Mussulman called ' the Kazee ' who goes to visit Faizoo. I do not know who he is, or what he comes for, but I have heard that he came to visit the Reverend Mr. Taylor. I have often seen him when Mr. Taylor has not been here. I am not on good terms with the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam. One time when the Commission was sitting, he asked me to give him information about Bhow Poonekur, and promised me to get some favor from the Maharaja. I said that I would tell my master if he made any overtures to me of that kind. Since then he has shown enmity towards me, and when the Resident went to Mukhurpoora, would not allow me to sit in the bullock-cart provided for the servants. I had a quarrel with him about this. I did not tell Poonekur what Salam had said to me, as no fresh overtures were made to me. I know the old Hamal Govind Baloo, he lives near my room only two doors off; his old wife lives with him and no one else. I have never seen any one go and visit him. Eaizoo lives in the city, but he has a room in the servants' quarters. I know him since I came to the Residency to live. He usually brings his food with him from his house. He does not have any expense here that I know of, nor have I seen him go to the Camp Bazaar. This examination having been read over to the witness in Hindoostanee, a language which he understands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Before me this 13th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R.

I live in the city, but I take my turn to sleep at the Residency. I slept here on the night of 'Sunday, November 8th, and I was on duty on the morning of Monday, November 9th. I remember seeing the Resident return from his walk about 7 a.m . The Maharaja's Arab Sowar named Salam then came up to the place where the peons were sitting. I do not know liy he came so earl\ on that morning. Bala Peon was with me when I saw Salam first. I remember seeing the Assist ant Resident return from shooting. I came forward to hold his horse. Salam was then present with the other two Jasoods, named Yeshwuntrao and Madhao- rao. I do not remember whether Faizoo was present or not, but he may have been present. The fruit was not brought on that morning until between 8 and 8-30 a.m. I have seen a Mussulman who is called ' Kazee.' He is a friend of Faizoo, and always goes to his quarters in the Residency. I do not know who he is, but I believe he comes to visit the Reverend Mi. Ta\lor. I remember taking a note on Monday morning from the Resident to Dr. Seward As I was going Salam called out to me and gave me a rupee telling me to cr'et some biscuits fo? him from the bazaar. I delivered the note to Dr. Seward, and then went to get the biscuits, but as none were ready I gave thebaker four annas and told him to make them. On my return I told Salam that they were not ready, and he then said that he would come and fetch them three or four days later. Up to the present time he has not asked me for the biscuits, and the change of the rupee 12 annas I have still got.

I came to Baroda about a year ago from Bombay. I have never been in Baroda before. I was employed as Butler in Major Blake- ney's service, but left it about 24 months ago. Since that time I live with my wife in the Residency compound. I have seen the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam come to Faizoo's quarters which are next to mine. He always comes when the Maharaja comes. I have also seen a mussul- man whom they call' the Kazee ' come to visit Faizoo. The Kazee comes to visit the Reverend Mr. Taylor. I do not know who he is, or where he lives, but I have heard Faizoo say that he comes from the Deccan. His residence is, I think, Chandode, or some name like that. The Kazee stated to me that he was once in the present Maharaja's service, but that he had been driven away.

A few minutes afterwards Rowjee brought a note from the Resident to take to Dr. Seward. As he was going Salam told Mahomed to get him some biscuits from the bazaar, and gave him a rupee for the purpose. Mahomed took the rupee away. I have never seen Salam come so early as he did that morning. I do not know why he came so early. The fruit came about one and a half hours afterwards. When the Jemadar returned to duty at 7-30, I left and went home to eat. Luximon was also on duty on the same morning.

I remember his preparing it on the morning of Monday, 9th November. He squeezed it as usual into a small tumbler, which he then took with him into the dining-room. When Abdoolla has not prepared it, Faizoo has prepared it. I remember seeing Faizoo on the morning of Monday, the 9th, about 6-30 come into the dispense-khana. He went from there inlo the dining-room. When he came into the dispense-khana Abdoolla was present with me, and saw him come in. I do not know why he went into the dining- room.

P hayre, Col., Resident. Statement by the Revd. J. Taylor, A .M. Missionary, Borsud Kaira District, aged 55. S ince the middle of 1873 I have been in the habit of visiting Baroda as a Missionary, and visiting families in the camp, the railway, and the city. On these occasions I have stayed at the Besidency where natives have been in the habit ol visiting me in my private room. I know a Mussulman who repre sented himself to me as ' a Deccan Kazee.' He mentioned his name, which I do not remember, but he said he was best known by the above name. Almost every time that I have visited Baroda he has called upon me at the Residency ; he represented himself as having once been in the favor of the present Gaekwar during his imprisonment at Padra ; that the present Gaekwar was under great obligatioos to him, but that owing to the fact of his being a Mussulman, he was disliked by the Brahmin courtiers, who poisoned the mind of the Gaekwar against him by saying that he had called him a Kafir, and had spoken disrespectfully of the Hindoo religion; that for a long time he had never been invited to the Durbar; was under a cloud; would leave Baroda at once, but having got pecuniarily involved on account of the expenses which he had incurred on the Gaekwar's behalf when he was in prison, he wished to be reinstated into favor, and thus reimburse himself. He hoped that by my personal influence either with the Resident or His Highness I might be the means of enabling him to secure his object. He never was present at any of my religious services with the natives, and always avoided religious conversation. . i ra Pp r t i mate was he in his desire that I should introduce him to the Resident with a view, as he said, to his restoration to favor with the Gaekwar; that he lias even come to me at Borshud, and when I was at Bombay last year was particularly importunate. I always told him that if he had any special an&lt; ^ w ould draw up a petition, he might either present it directly to ae Resident, who was always open to receive petitions, or that I might venture to present it myself. He declined to write a petition, and I always ec ined to interfere in a general question like that raised without any specific +i ^ ( f Ct / have asked him why he did not go himself direct; and he replied nat it was best to use some person to introduce him. . ^ wen t on for about 15 months; the same story being always told, and ic same answer being always given. I had no reason to suspect the man. I therefore made no objection to his comin- 26About the end of August on arrival at the Residency one« morning, the • On a Thursday. Maharaja, who was sitting in the drawing room with the u A it . Resident, expressed a wish to speak to me. The Resident called me, and I sat down and began to converse with His Highness. The csit ent and one of the Durbar were present at the time. Next dav the Resi- en, m oimed me that His Highness the Gaekwar wished to show'me his new pa ace, and asked me to go accordingly on Saturday morning early. I did so. oug it here to mention however that on the previous day (Friday) the Kazee above referred to called upon me, asked me if I should like to have an inter- view with the Gaekwar; to my surprize alluded to the conversation I had had he previous day with His Highness, mo? that he had an influential friend in the Jjnibar who gave him information, and could arrange any interview with the jaekwai that would be agreeable; and asked in a casual way apparently what nuzzti an a 1 would take. I replied at once that all I desired was to see the Gaekwar take good advice and reform the administration of his State. The Ivazee made no further remark on the subject. It was after this interview that the Resident spoke to me saying that the Maharaja wished to see me, and advised me to go. I went to the palace, and was ushered into a room where His Highness soon appeared. Rao Sahib Bapoobhai and Govind Rao Mama of the Durbar conducted me there. His Highness opened the conversation which at once took a political turn, and from what they said I came to the conclusion that they were very much con cerned about the recent letter which the Gaekwar had received from Govern ment. The conversation afterwards took a religious turn, and the interview closed with His Highness showing me over the new palace. He expressed himself as much pleased at my visit, and in an hour or two I left for Borsud. On my next visit to Baroda the Kazee called upon me again, spoke of my visit to the Gaekwar, said that it had been of great use to him, that he had seen the Gaekwar who spoke in very laudatory terms of me, yet that all he desired had not been accomplished as the Gaekwar had not invited him so freely to the Durbar as he desired. On the Thursday, the 5th November, when I came home from the city in the evening, Faizoo was standing by my room's door, and I told him that as I had a bad headache, not to allow any one to disturb me for an hour. He said that the Kazee was waiting for me. I said that he might come. He again said that he had had only one interview with the Gaekwar since the time I had visited His Highness. He repeated what he had several times told me before. That though the Gaekwar had given him a horse, he had never given him any money, and that I might look upon him as dirt if he had received as much as a pice from the Gaekwar, but he hoped that by my favor he would soon find himself in much better circumstances. I do not think he came the next day, Friday, 6th November, and I left for Borsud on the 7th. Before me this 14th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hatre, Col., Resident. Appendix B. Resident's opinion on the ease. 1. The facts of this case so far as they are disclosed by the evidence appear to be as follows:— On the morning of Monday, November 9th, 1874, the Resident, Colonel Phayre, went out for his morning exercise as usual a little before 6 a.m. 272. After his departure the following persons came into Colonel Phayre's private office room to arrange the room, clean the inkstand, prepare the Resident's clothes, &amp;c.:— (1.) Hamal Govind Baloo came iu, as he himself states, a little after 6 a. m . to clean the tables, chairs, &amp;c., and set the room in order. (2.) Lnximon Peon states that he came into the room about 6-15 a.m. to arrange the inkstand, papers, &amp;c., and that after arranging them he went away and did not return. (3.) Abdoolla, Chobdar and table-servant states that he made pummelo sherbet as usual for the Resident, and brought it into his room about 6-30 a.m ., that he arranged the Resident's clothes, &amp;c., as usual, and then left the room leaving there Hamals Govind Baloo and Yellapa, and also Luximon Peon. (4.) Yellapa Nursoo, Hamal, states that he swept the room on the morning of Monday, the 9th instant; and that when he went to the room first, Govind Baloo and Abdoolla were then present, and that both of them were also there when he left. (5.) Rowjee Rama, Havildar of Peons, states that he was present at the Resident's room when Abdoolla brought the pummelo sherbet on the morning of Monday, the 9th, and that he left the Resident's room before Abdoolla did. No one except these five persons are known to have had access to the Resident's private office room during his absence on the morning of Monday, November 9th, from about G a.m . to G-55 a.m. 3. The Resident returned from exercise at 6 -55 a.m . as shown by the clock in his room. He found the pummelo sherbet prepared as usual. He took two or three sips of it and then sat down to write. In about 20 minutes to half an hour afterwards he felt sick at stomach, and thinking that the sherbet must have been made with a bad pummelo he threw most of it through the window. His attention was however arrested by a dark sediment at the bottom of the tumbler, and he for the first time suspected poison. 4. The Resident then at once wrote a note to the Residency Surgeon sum- moning him. This note was delivered to Rowjee, Havildar of Peons, who gave it to another peon named Mahomed to deliver to Dr. Seward. 5. When this note for Dr. Seward was delivered by Rowjee to Mahomed, a certain Arab Sowar named Salam, who is a confidential servant of the Maha raja, was present at the Residency. Rowjee Havildar states that he asked Salam, the Arab Sowar referred to, why he had come in that morning so un usually early. Salam replied that he come to bring the Dewalee fruit, which however did not reach the Residency till about one and a half hours afterwards. 6. As Mahomed Peon was taking the Resident's note to Dr. Seward, Salam, the Arab Sowar, accosted him, entered into conversation, gave to him a rupee, and asked him to bring from the bazaar for himself (Salam) some biscuits. After this conversation had taken place, Mahomed went and delivered the Resi dent's note to Dr. Seward, and afterwads went on to the bazaar and made enquiry about the biscuits which he had been asked to procure. 7. Dr. Seward, on receipt of the Resident's note, at once came over. The Resident then showed him the remains of the tumbler of sherbet, and stated his unusual symptoms and communicated to him his suspecion that the sherbet contained poison. Dr. Seward took the tumbler away with him saying that he w T ould analyse it. 8. About 8-30 a.m . Mr. Boevey, Assistant Resident, returned from shooting. When he arrived at the Residency he was accosted by Eshwunt * This man is said to have since died suddenly RaO JaSOOd, Salam, tllC Arab Sowar above under suspicious circumstances. referred to, and by Madhowrao* Sowar, all three of whom are confidential servants of the Maharaja; they delivered the 28 Exd.-J. M.usual fruit and sweetmeats and presented the Maharaja's compliments; several of the Residency servants were present at the time; and amongst others Faizoo Ramzan Chobdar was seen by the Assistant Resident talking to the Arab Sowar Salam on the place where the peons sit, as he rode up to the door. 9. The Maharaja arrived to call on the Resident shortly after 9 a.m . At that time the Resident was feeling very uncomfortable symptoms of nausea which, however, he concealed and received the Maharaja as usual. The conversation chiefly turned on the sickness then prevailing in the city, and the Maharaja alluded to the fact that he himself had been lately suffering from fever, accompanied by purging and dizziness in the head which symtoms he attributed to having eaten too freely of sweetmeats. The Resident's attention was excited by hearing the Maharaja relate regarding himself symtoms which appeared to correspond so nearly with what he had himself described to Dr. Seward just previously, and which he attributed to a very different cause to that assigned by the Maharaja—in other words to poison. The Resident said nothing, and the Maharaja in due course took his leave. 10. After the departure of the Maharaja the Resident communicated to Mr. Boevy, Assistant Resident, his suspicion that poison had been adminis tered to him, and commented on the fact that the Maharaja had related regard ing himself symptoms which so nearly corresponded with those from which he, Colonel Phayre, was suffering at the time. Ik About 11 a.m . Dr. Seward, Residency Surgeon, returned to the Resi dency, and formally certified that the contents of the tumbler given to him for examination by the Resident contained amongst other substances common white arsenic. 12. Before, however, receiving this formal corroboration of his suspicions, Colonel Phayre had expressed to Mr. Boevey his conviction that he was then under the influence of poison. He further stated that from the unusual symptoms which he had experienced during the few previous days, viz., nausea, dizziness in the head, purging, &amp;c., he was certain that poison had been administered to him on previous occasions. So satisfied was Colonel Phayre of the truth of his suspicions, that before the receipt of Dr. Seward's official corroboration, he had commenced a report to Government alleging the fact that he was then suffering from poison, and that attempts had been made to poison him on previous days. 18. On the receipt of Dr. Seward's report a strict enquiry was at once commenced. Abdoolla, the servant who made the sherbet, was examined, and all the persons who had had access to the Resident's private Office room between 6 a.m . and 6-55 a.m . were at once placed under restraint. 1 i. The result of this enquiry was to free from al suspicion the servant who had himself made the sherbet, but the following persons were placed under arrest:— 1.—Govind Baloo Ilamal. 2.—Ellapa ITamal. 3.—Luximon, Peon. 4.—Rowjee, Havildar of Peons. 15. Suspicion also at once attached to a Chobdar and table servant, named Paizoo Ramzan, a man of indifferent character, who was known to be an intriguer, and whose conduct for many months past had been highly suspicious. As however he denied that he had had access to the Resident's private Office room on the morning of Monday, November 9th, and as there was nothing against him but mere suspicion he was for the time allowed to be at large. His room in the Residency compound was however searched, and a sum of Government Rupees 100 was found, of which no satisfactory account could be given as his family, &amp;c., lived in the city, and as he had no expenses in the Camp Bazaar. 29 830 16. Of the four persons above alluded to in pciragraph 14 suspicion chiefly attached to the two llamals, C&gt;o\ind l^aloo, and, 2, J^llapa Tsmsoo. Both of them appeared much agitated under examination, and gave answers with much prevarication and reluctance. They both of them denied having seen any pummelo sherbet in the Resident's room as usual on the morning in question, although they had seen it on previous mornings, and Govind Baloo admitted having been the last to leave the room j ast before 7 a.m . when the Resident returned. 17. On November 11th Faizoo Rarnzan Chobdar and table servant was again examined, and at the conclusion of his examination was given into custody. It was discovered that he was in the receipt of regular Durbar pay, and that for some months past he had been in the habit of receiving visits from two most suspicious characters, one of whom was the ]VIaharaja s Arab confidential servant, named Salam, and the other a Mussalman, known as ' the Kazee, ,, who was also a servant of the present Maharaja, and is said to have done valuable service for him when he was in confinement at Padra. Both of these men used constantly to visit Faizoo Ramzan in his quarters at the Residency, and are w^ell known by the whole of the Resident's establishment. 18. Before proceeding further with the narrative, it appears material to give such information as is procurable regarding the persons above referred to— 1, Eaizoo Ramzan, Residency Chobdar and table servant; 2, the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam; 3, the Mussulman, known as ' the Kazee.' 19. With regard to Faizoo Ramzan it appears from his own statement that he has acted as Chobdar and table servant in the Residency for the last 20 years. He admits that he draws Rupees 10 per memsem from the Durbar in the name of his son who though only 14 years of age is enrolled as a Sowar in the Khas Paga. He has received this pay from the time of Colonel Wallace. He lives in the city, but he has a room in the Residency compound. He always waits at table, and' has been in the habit of preparing the Resident's pummelo sherbet on days that it was not prepared by Abdoolla, and admits that he may have prepared it so lately as Friday, November 6th. He has often brought to the Resident his afternoon tea, and has been officious in trying to exclude the Resident's private servants from waiting on their master in this respect. The Resident has been more than once warned to be on his guard againsjt Faizoo Ramzan both by his private servant, Pedro, and by others ; and about the month of June 1873, in consequence of information received, the Resident was on the point of discharging Faizoo Ramzan from the service; but having recently dismissed another Chobdar and table servant, named Nur Ullah, who was sus pected of being untrustworthy, the Resident was induced to be compassionate, and retained Faizoo Ramzan in his service. 20. In the time of Colonel Barr and Colonel Shortt, Faizoo Ramzan is stated to have been engaged in the most notorious intrigues in the city, and was in the habit of constantly visiting Nana Sahib Khanvilkur, Bulwunt Rao Eshwunt, Bulwunt Rao Rahoorkur, and others. The notorious character of Faizoo Ramzan was of course not known to the R-esident until he commenced to make careful enquiries regarding him in consequence of the suspicion attaching to him in the case now under report; but he had received from time to time general reports that he was unfaithful from different members of the establishment. 21. With regard to the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam, the Resident has to state that he has long been aware that he is the chief of the Maharaja's spies and intelligence agents in Camp. He usually attends the Maharaja on his periodical visits to the Residency twice in the week, and invariably goes to the servants' quarters, and sits at Faizoo Ramzan's door. His intimacy with Faizoo P^amzan is notorious, and has continued ever since the present Maharaja came to the guddee. He is also said to be on intimate terms with the four dis reputable characters alluded to in the Resident's letter to Government No. 133-681, of 28th July 1873, who were turned out of camp at his request by31 order of the Commander-in-Chief in the month of July last year. Some of these persons, it will he remembered, were prominently engaged in the con spiracy got up by the present Maharaja in 1863 to murder his brother, Khunde ilao, and thus their connection with the Arab confidential servant of the Maharaja is doubly significant at the present'time. 22. During the whole of the Resident's visit to Nowsaree in the months of March, April, and May of the present year, Salam was employed to live near his establishment; and the Ptesident was at that time particularly warned against him. The Resident cautioned his butler, but did nothing more at that -p time. 23. With reference to the third person mentioned above who is known as ' the Kazee' the Resident's chief information regarding him will be found in a very remarkable statement which is appended to the notes of evidence, and which was furnished to the Resident regarding him by the Revd. Mr. Taylor of Borsud, who has been in the habit of receiving him constantly as a Missionary during the last 18 months in his private room at the Residency, and elsewhere. The main points in this statement are:— 1. That the Mussulman known as 'the Kazee'' has been in the habit of soliciting the Revd. Mr. Taylor to use his influence with the Resident to pro cure for himself from the Gaekwar certain objects of his own. 2. That he has regularly visited the Residency for the alleged purpose of seeing Mr. Taylor for the last 18 months. 3.. That on one occasion he directly attempted to bribe Mr. lay lor apparently on the part of the Maharaja, as he is a servant ot his. 4. That the ' Kazee's' story to Mr. Taylor is on the face of it false ; and appears only to have been trumped up as an excuse tor regularly \ isiting the Residency. 24. From enquiries which have recently been instituted, it appears that the Mussulman in question is a native of Chandode in Nassik generally kno\^n as Dada Meeya. That he is a man of bad character who was M ulhar Rao's Agent while he was in confinement at Padra. He is also said to ha\e been much empldt^d on the present Maharaja's business during the eventful months that intervened between the death ot His Highness Khunde Rao in No\ cmbci^ / , and the brith of a posthumous daughter to the Ex-Ranee Jumna Baee in the month of July 1871, before the present Maharaja's formal recognition by Government. 25. Such then is the man who has been in the habit of visiting the Revd. Mr. Taylor at the Baroda Residency during the past 18 months. The nature of his communications to the Reverend Mr. Taylor can be seen by referring to the statement of Mr. Taylor which is appended to the proceedings. A\ hat Mr. Taylor however did not know is the fact that this Mussulman has been in the habit of securing access to him through the now notorious Kesidency Chobdar and table servant Faizoo Kamzan, above referred to On the occasion of his visiting Mr. Taylor 'the Kazee' invariably went first to Faizoo Uamzan s room and has often been seen to go there-at times when Mr. Taylor has not been present and to have remained with him for long periods together. It is most significant that during this protracted period of 18 months the Kazeo referred to took particular care to avoid the Eesidcut who has never even seen him up to the present moment that he is aware ot. . 20. Having thus given a sketch of the three persons above alluded to in paragraph 18, vil, the Residency Chobdar and table s erva n t Faizoo am™n 2 the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salem; 3, the Mussulman Agent of His Highness the Gaekwar, known as the Kazee, the Resident now proceeds to comment on the evidence which has been recorded.usual on tlmt morniDg in tliG pres6ncG of Itunclicird TLutna ]\Xussal, and this statement is corroborated by the evidence of llunchard llutna. Abdoolla larther states that having prepared the sherbet as usual, he took it into the Resident s room about 6-30 a.m ., at which time the Hamals Govind Baloo and Yellapa Nursoo were in the room, and Rowjee llavildar ol peons was near the room. It also appears from Abdoolla's statement that while he was in the room Lux- mon peon came in to clean the inkstand, &amp;c. AY hen Abdoola left the room he states that the two Hamals above referred to and Luxmon peon were in the Resident's private room where the pummelo sherbet then was, and that Rowjee Havildar was in the ante -room. AA hen Abdoolla had placed the pummelo sherbet on the Resident's table, he states that he returned to the dispense- khana to prepare the butter, and that he then for the first time that morning saw Faizoo Ramzan who came into the room where Abdoolla and a Mussal, named Runchard Rutna, were employed on their usual work. The fact that Eaizoo Ramzan did go into the dispensekhana at about 6-30 a.m ., on the morn ing of Monday, November 9th 1874, is corroborated by the evidence of Runchard Rutna, who further states that Faizoo Ramzan went from the dispensekhana into the dining room, but for what purpose he does not know. 28. Why Faizoo Ramzan went into the dining room at all at so early an hour cannot be clearly ascertained. At that time the Hamils had not been into the room to clean it, and the table was not ready to be laid. The silver more over which was in the dining room was not cleaned until a later hour. Whether Faizoo Ramzan went to the Resident's private Office room or not on the morning of Monday, November 9th, cannot be ascertained. Faizoo Ramzan himself dist nctly denies it, but as he was seen to go into the dining room, one door of which is only 15 paces distant from the backdoor of the Resident's private Office room, there was ample opportunity for him to have done so; and had he gone by the back of the Residency outside he could not possibly have been seen by any of the peons or servants inside the house. 29. Rowjee llavildar of peons was arrested in the first instance, because he was shown to have had access to the room where the pummelo sherbet was during the Resident's absence. As it appears however that he left tiie room before Abdoolla left it, he was at once released from custody. V 30. Luxmon peon was also released for a similar reason. It should be noticed however that there is a discrepancy between his statement and that of Ab.doolla. Luxmon states that when he left the Resident's private Office room Abdoolla and the two Hamals alone were present in the room and remained in the room after he had left. Abdoolla states that Luxmon remained behind in the room with the two Hamals, after he, Abdoolla, had left about 6-30 a. m. Whether Luxmon peon remained in the room after Abdoolla had left or went out of the room before him cannot be certainly ascertained. It does not however appear to be a point of much importance as no suspicion attaches to Luxmon except on the ground that he was one of the few persons who had had access to the room between 6 a. m . and 6-55. a. m* 31. The two Hamals, Yellapa Nursoo and Govind Baloo, are still in custody. Yellapa Nursoo states that after sweeping the room he left it about 6-30 a. m., leaving there at that time Abdoolla and the .other Hamal Govind Baloo. Ab doolla states that when he left about 6-30. a. m. Yellapa Nursoo remained behind with the other hamal. There is thus in this instance also a discrepancy simlar to that noticed above in paragraph 30 in the case of Luxmon peon. Whether Yellapa Nursoo left the Resident's room before Abdoolla or after him does not appear to be a matter of great importance as they both probably left about the same time, namely, about 6-30. a. m . The chief element of suspicion against Hamal Yellapa ^sursoo lies in the fact that he denied having seen any pummelo sherbet brought by Abdoolla on the morning in question, ft appears to be inconceivable that he should have failed to see whether Abdoolla brought the sherbet or not as usual. It was also noticeable that Yellapa Nursoo appeared to be much agitated under examination, and gave his evidence with 22 Exd.- R. T. B.reluctance. Notwithstanding however this fact the Resident is inclined to exonerate from suspicion the llaraal in question. He takes his turn with three others to sweep the Resident's private room, and has no other connection with it. 32. 'With regard to the other Hamal, Govind Baloo, the case against him appears to stand on a different footing. Of all the Ilamals employed at the Residency, Govind Baloo is the only one who is employed daily in the Resi dent's private room. It is his duty to clean the tables, arrange the dressing- table, &amp;c., and do in fact everything except sweep the room. The four other Ilamals wiio are employed at the Residency take it by turns to sweep out the Resident's private office room. 33. Baloo Govind admits that on the morning of Monday, November 9th, he went to clean the Resident's room shortly after 0 a.m . ; that Abdoolla was then there, but that he shortly afterwards left; that lie, Govind Baloo, left the room shortly before 7 a.m . On pressing the deponent to state how he knew the exact time when he left the Resident's room, he stated that he heard the clock strike about five minutes after he left. When it is remembered that the Resident returned from his exercise just at the time stated, the significance of the answer is apparent, as it shows that Govind Baloo w r as the last person who is known to have left the Resident's private room before the Resident's return on the morning of Monday, November 9th, 187^. 34. Govind Baloo distinctly denied that (although he saw Abdoolla in the room as usual, and fruit on the table) he saw any sherbet on the table which it is his business to clean. Govind Baloo was much pressed on this point, and after much prevarication and evident agitation of manner, he finally stuck to his original assertion that he saw no sherbet on the table as usual. It is noticeable, however, that on the first examination of Govind Baloo, which took place on November 9th, he distinctly stated that Abdoolla brought pummelo juice, but on being further pressed he denied it. 35. From the foregoing brief review of all the evidence which has been recorded in the case, it will be seen that suspicion mainly attaches to— 1. Eaizoo Ramzan, Chobdar and table servant in the Residency Estab lishment. 2. Govind Baloo, Hamal. 36. The reasons for suspecting Faizoo Ramzan of complicity in the crime of attempting to administer poison to the Resident may be thus summa rized :— 1. Faizoo Ramzan is admittedly in the pay of the Durbar. 2. He has been in the habit of holding most intimate relations with two disreputable and suspicious persons, both of whom are confidential servants and agents of His Highness Mulhar Rao Gaekwar. 3. He has been in the habit of receiving both these persons in his quarters at the Residency without any just cause or excuse whatever. 4. He is himself a notorious intriguer, and lias, at least in Colonel Shortt's time, been engaged in political intrigues with prominent members of the Durbar. 5. His position as table servant has given him exceptional opportunities for the commission of the crime. 6. He has behaved very suspiciously in trying to forestall the Resident's private servants in waiting on him with tea, &amp;c. 7. He has often made for the Resident pummelo sherbet, and admits that he may have made it on the morning of Friday, November 6th, on w^hich day also the Resident believes it to have been poisoned, as he suffered unaccount ably after drinking it. 33 98 He had ample opportunities of poisoning tlie slierbet himself in collusion with Govind Baloo Hamal on the morning of Monday, November 9th, 1874. 9. His statement abounds with falsehoods and contradictions. 10. He is a disreputable and dangerous character, whose antecedents have now for the first time been clearly made know n. 11. He could give no satisfactory explanation of Government Rupees 100 which were found in his box at the Hesidency. 12. He had ample opportunities for conspiring with Govind Baloo Hamal, as these two were left behind together at the Residency when the Resident went with the Maharaja to Nowsaree from April to May last. 37. The reasons for suspecting Govind Baloo Hamal are as follows :— 1. Govind Baloo admits that he was in the Resident's private room with Abdoolla on the morning of Monday, November Oth, and that Abdoolla left the room before he did. 9. Although Govind Baloo first acknowledged and then denied that he saw Abdoolla bnnging pummelo sherbet as usual, it is certain that Abdoolla did bring and place it on the table as usual in Govind Baloo's presence. 3. Govind Baloo admits that he did not leave the Resident's private room until verv near 7 a.m . At that time he was the only person who is known to have been in the room, and the Resident returned just about the time that he left the room. 4. Govind Baloo Hamal is the only servant who is employed daily in the Resident's private office room. Four other Hamals take it by turns to sweep the room. 5. Govind Baloo was much agitated under examination, and gave his evidence in a most suspicious manner, he also showed a marked disinclination to say anything regarding the other suspected persons, Paizoo Ramzan. 6. Govind Baloo was left at the Residency with Taizoo Ramzan during the Resident's absence at Nowsaree during the months of April and May, and has had peculiar facilities for committing the crime in question. 38. From this summary it will be seen that there is no direct evidence against either of the suspected persons of the crime of administering poison to the Resident on the morning of Monday, November 9th, but that either ol the suspected persons had an opportunity of committing the crime either sepa rately or in collusion, and that no serious suspicion at present attaches to any other person in the Residency Establishment. 39. It remains to consider certain collateral points which bear more or less directly on the matter under investigation. 40. First, with regard to the nature of the poison employed, the Resident received on the 12th instant confidential information that the poison administer ed to him consisted, 1^, of arsenic; %id, diamond dust; 3&gt; y /, copper. The presence of the two elements first named, viz., arsenic and diamond dust, has been formally corroborated by the analysis of the Residency Surgeon and Chemical Analyser to Government, copies of whose reports and letters on the subject are herewith attached. The presence of copper was suspected by the Chemical Analyser to Government, in consequence of the symptom stated by the Resident that after drinking some of the poisoned sherbet he recognized a strong metallic taste. The presence of copper has not however yet been officially verified; but considering the fact that arsenic is tasteless or nearly so, there is a strong probability that the Resident's independent information regarding the admixture of copper is correct. 41. It appears to be almost certain that a poisonous compound of arsenic, diamond dust, and copper would not have been employed by an ordinary poisoner to effect the destruction of the Resident's life. The combined use of these 3435 chemical agents points to considerable method and design on the part of the would-be poisoner, and suggests a tolerably familiar acquaintance with poisonous substances. Diamond dust, though said to be perfectly innocuous by itself, is not a substance which is easily procurable for purposes of crime, and the Resident is bound to record as an extraordinary coincidence that before he had received any official corroboration of the presence of diamond dust, he was privately informed that certain diamonds from the Maharaja's Jamdarkhana were missing, and that they had been erased from the official inventory in order that their loss might not hereafter be traced. 42. Secondly, with regard to the occurrences which immediately followed the attempt to poison the llesident, the following facts should carefully be noticed. Not a word was said to the llesident on the subject of the attempt to poison him by Mr. Dadabhoy Nowrojee or by His Ilighness the Maharaja until upwards of three days after the attempt had been made, when the Maha raja visited him on Thursday, November 12th. The rumour of the attempt to poison the Resident began to spread far and wide on Monday, Nov ember 9th, and was well known throughout the city and camp on the day after the attempt was made, Tuesday. On the Wednesday following the matter was well known in Bombay and up the Railway line. Although Mr. Dadabhoy Nowroj e visited the Resident as usual on those days, Tuesday the 10th, and 'Wednesday the 11th, he never said a word to him about the occurrence, although he must have been perfectly well aware of what had taken place. 43. On Thursday, 12th November, when the Maharaja paid the Resident his usual visit he came to him for the first time accouipanicd by Mr. Dadahhoy Nowrojee, although he is always in the habit of coming to the Resident alone. The Maharaja appeared very much agitated, and remarked to the Resident that lie had heard yesterday evening, Wednesday, for the first time that there had been an attempt to poison him. Mr. Dadabhoy Nowrojee remarked that he had heard the subject rumoured on Tuesday, but had not believed it. No official communication from the Durbar on the subject was received until late on the evening of Saturday, 14th November, after Office hours or until nearly six days had elapsed after the attempt to murder the Resident had been made. 44. When it is remembered that the Maharaja's confidential Arab servant, Salam, had attended at the Residency early in the morning of Monday, November 9th, in order, as the Resident believes, to give early intimation to the Maharaja of the effects of the poison, and when further it is remembered that this same Arab servant Salum had craftily endeavoured to stop the peon who was sent to deliver the Resident's note summoning the Residency Surgeon, it will be seen that there are reasonable grounds for receiving with incredulity the Maharaja's extraordinary statement that he only heard of the attempt to poison the Resident for' the first time on the evening of Wednesday, November 11th. 45 With reference to the official communication from the Durbar on the subject of the attempt to poison the Resident which was received after Office hours on the evening of Saturday, November 14th, appended to this report is a separate statement by the Resident regarding the general attitude assumed by His Highness the Maharaja and by the Durbar in the matter. This statement is annexed and is marked C. 46 Having thus taken into consideration the whole of the evidence in this very serious^ase, the Resident is most unwillingly driven to the following conclusions:— 1 That an undoubted attempt to poison him has been made by two or more persons of the llesidency establishment who bave no conceivable personal motives for tbe crime and utterly repudiate its commission. 2 That tbis attempt was made with the cognizance and connivance of His Highness tbe Maharaja, two of whose confidential servants have been conspiring for months with one of tbe Residency table servants, of course without tiie knowledge of tbe Resident.47. It is mucli to be regretted that the evidence adduced is not of a more direct character, but amply sufficient matter appears to have been established to show that the present attempt on the life of the British Resident is purely a political crime and due to no private motives whatever. The Resident has little hope that the persons now in custody will be induced voluntarily to confess the crime with which they are charged, and without such a confession there is little hope of obtaining any further evidence regarding the real insti gator of the crime. 48. It appears to be unnecessary to say much on the political aspect of the crime now under report. The Government are well aware that His High ness the Gaekwar has for many months been using every possible device to procure the Resident's removal from his present olhce by means both fair and foul. Up to the present time the Resident has always received the most cordial support and assistance from Government without which it would have been utterly impossible for him to have maintained his footing against the constant and unremitting attacks to which he has been subjected. It appears clear that the judicial aspects of this case is far subordinate to the political, and that the events that have taken place since the warnings conveyed to His Highness the Gaekwar in the khureeta of 25th July last culminating in this act of desperation afford reasonable evidence that anything but a spirit of reform is at present at work in the Baroda State.

I have duly received your letter and its enclosures, viz., a demi-official from Colonel Phayre and a small packet which contained few grains of greyish colored powder mixed with numerous gritty glistening particles. I have examined the powder and find it to consist partly of common white arsenic and partly of finely powdered siliceous matter. This siliceous matter under the microscope appeared to be either powdered glass or quartz, being most like the former. Some of the particles had a purplish or rose colored tinge which fact may perhaps furnish you with a clue as to its source. If you wish an official reply in addition to the present, I shall send it. Herewith is returned Colonel Phayre's letter. I shall keep the remains ef the powder in my possession till I hear further from you. No. 501A., dated 13th November 1874. From— Col . R.

W ith reference to the statement made in your letter that the powder forwarded to you consisted partly of common white arsenic and partly of finely powdered siliceous matter which under the microscope appeared to be either 36 Exd.—J. T. F.I powdered glass or quartz, being most like the former, I should feel much obliged by your kindly informing me whether in your opinion the siliceous matter referred to can possibly be powdered diamond. 3. Previous to the receipt of your letter under reference I had received •Please do not mention this at present, secret and confidential information* that the poison (sa.) r . p. administered to me did consist of— 1^.—Common arsenic. Znd.—Finely powdered diamond dust. 3rc?.—Copper. The importance of verifying this information is obvious. W hilst the above letter of mine, dated the 13th November, was being written the Chemical Analyser was on the same date writing from Bombay as follows:— 'Dated Grant College Laboratory, Bombay, 13th November 1H74. ' From—S urgeon W. G uay , Actiner Chemical Analyser to Government, (demi-official). ' To—Dr. Seward. In continuation of my letter of the 11th, I wish to tell you that a still closer examination of the gritty powder has led me to think that part of it at least is diamond dust. The lustre of some of the particles seems to me too great for anything else, and they are besides exceedingly hard, quite insoluble in any acid. This opinion, however, is based only on ocular inspection. I am not in possession of any means here to test the substance chemically should it be asserted that it is diamond dust, and besides the quantity sent is exceedingly minute. ' How do you account for the metallic taste described by Colonel Phayre ? Can it be copper ? Arsenic is tasteless or nearly so. I failed to find any compound of copper in the powder you sent me; but as all its salts are very soluble, it is possible that if put into the pummalo juice, it may have been all thrown away when the tumbler was emptied. The early appearance of the symptoms may be due to the fact that he took the arsenic in solution, or rather suspended in the pummalo juice on an empty stomach. He may also have taken a comparatively large proportion of what was in the tumbler, as arsenic unless well mixed has a habit of floating on the top of a liquid. Natives have a firm belief in the deadly properties of diamond dust or powdered glass, but the fact is that neither of them possess any deleterious qualities. ^ I shall be happy to examine anything else you may require done. Is it possible to obtain any of the pummalo juice, or any part of the ground or other place upon which it was thrown, if so, we might be able to detect copper if present.' The above letter was received on Saturday night, the 14th. Next morning I wrote a note to Dr. Seward to the effect that I had heard that a sure test of powdered diamond was to rub it on glass, and that if it scratched the glass, it was diamond dust, as I believed that neither powdered glass or quartz would scratch glass. Dr. Seward put this to the test, and on Monday morning, the 16th instant, he wrote as follows :— ' M y dear C olonel P hatre, ' I t scratches glass readily.* ' Your's sincerely, ' (Sd.) G. E. S eward.' • The crystalline fragments of the poison sediment.—(Sd.) G. E.

Dr. Seward's letter in which the packet was enclosed and the packet itself w^as sealed, the seals were perfect and their device was an inscription in the Persian character. I have examined the above mentioned greyish powder, and have succeeded in detecting in it arsenious acid or common w r hite arsenic. A gritty insoluble residue which remained after the solution of the arsenic I at first considered to. be, after the usual negative tests, had been applied, some kind of silicious matter such from as powdered glass or quartz. A subsequent examination, however, led me to the conclusion that some at least of the gritty particles, those which presented a brilliant lustre, were diamond dust. 1 have examined these lustrous particles a third and fourth time, and have seen no reason to change my opinion that they are diamond. Several of the insoluble particles showed under the microscope a purplish or rose colored tinge. I have also examined the powder for copper, but have failed to detect the slightest trace either of it or of any other mineral poison. No. 401, dated Bombay, 19th November 1874. trom Surgeon W.

Many of the glitter- ing particles appear to be of the same nature as those seen in the powder sent me by JJr. Seward, namely, diamond dust, other glittering dark coloured particles in the earthy matter prove to be oxide of iron, being in fact the same substance that is commonly used as sand for drying ink. Appendix. C. Statement hy Colonel Phayre, C.B., Resident, Baroda, da led IQth November 1874. T he attempt to poison me was- made on the morning of Monday, the 9th November 1874. The small quantity of poisoned sherbet taken by me was swallowed at about 7 a.m . At about 20 minutes or half past 9 a.m . the Maharaja paid me his usual visit. After some common place remarks His High ness observed that the weather was not healthy, that there was a good deal of fever in the city, and that he himself had been suffering from purging and headache and fever from eating the usual Dewallee sweetmeats, but that he had recovered. I made no remark, but it occurred to me that His Highness had led the conversation to the subject in order to elicit some remarks from me. I have since learnt from the evidence that His Highness' confidential Arab Sowar, Salam, was at the Residency earlier than usual on that morning; that when I sent a note to summon Dr. Seward between 7 and 8 o'clock the Arab Sowar stopped the peon, Mahomed, who w^as carrying it, and asked him to buy him some biscuits in the bazaar, which extraordinary occurrence I can only account for by a desire on the part of Salam to divert the peon's attention from his proper errand to summon the Residency Surgeon. By about noon on Monday the attempt to poison me began to spread in the camp and city. Next day, Tuesday, 10th, several people from the citv came to call or sent to enquire after my health, but no one came from the Maharaja. Wednesday, the 11th, pasged in a similar manner without any enquiry on His Highness' part. On Thursday, the 12th, His Highness came to pay his usual visit, and on this occasion, for the first time, he was accompanied by Mr. Dadabhyi, usually His Highness comes alone. His Highness opened the conversation by saying that he had heard on the previous day (11th) that some one had poisoned me, and asked how I was, remarking at the same time that I showed no signs of hav ing been poisoned when he called on Monday, the 9th instant. Previous to this remark by His Highness I had not mentioned the hour at which I was poisoned, but I afterwards told him how the Maharaja knew that I had been poisoned when I came to receive him on the Monday morning is not apparent. Mr. Dadabhoy said that he heard the rumour first on Tuesday, 10th, but did not believe it. That the rumour was repeated so strongly on the 11th that he believed it, and that he intended to speak about it next day, 12th. He asked me if I was making enquiry imo the matter, and I replied that I was, and he expressed a hope that I should succeed in discovering the perpetrator of the crime. On Saturday, the 14th instant, after dark in the evening, 5-45, I received the following yad from the Durbar:— Durbar yad to the Resident, No. 2057, dated 14th November 1874. ' A t a personal interview with you the day before yesterday I learnt from you the particulars about the attempt made by some bad man to poison you, for which I am very sorry. But it was the favor of God that his cruel design did not meet with success. ' If it becomes necessary for you to obtain my assistance in proving this criminal's guilt, the same will be given. This is written for your information'.It will be observed that iu this yad His Highness alludes only to having heard of the matter from me personally on the 12th instant, jwhereas the report had spread everywhere by the evening of the 9th November, and it is not reasonable to suppose that His Highness had not heard of it immediately, as everything is reported to him at once by his spies. Moreover, he himself told me on Thursday, the 12th, that he had heard it the previous day, and had resolved to speak regarding on it his next visit that morning. The delay of His Highness in not taking notice of the occurrence till Thursday, the 12th, and afterwards in writing the yad, offering assistance on the evening of the 14th, the 6th day after the event, are remarkable.

With wllldl I Submitted the letter - Judicial Proceedings recorded by me in the late serious attempt to poison me, I stated that I had arrived at the conclusion that the attempt on my life emanated solely from His Highness the Maharaja. 2. I respectfully submit that having now arrived at this conclusion it would be in the highest degree inconsistent were I to continue to receive His Highness as usual, as though nothing had occurred. Such a proceeding, I sub mit, is neither necessary or desirable, and under these circumstances, I would respectfully request permission to intimate to His Highness' Minister that until the Government has considered and arrived at some conclusion upon the whole case, in both its judicial and political aspects. His Highness' visits to the Resi dency twice a week might with propriety be discontinued. I should feel obliged by being favored with orders by telegram upon this subject. No. 387-1295, dated Baroda, 23rd November 1874 (Confideltial). From— C olonel R. P hayre , C.B., Resident at Baroda, To—C. G onne , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I n continuation of my confidential letter No. 379-1271, dated 17th instant, and accompanying Judicial Proceedings in the attempt to administer poison to me, I have the honor herewith to forward copy of a further examination of the prisoner, Faizoo, in consequence of his having spontaneously made a request to be brought before me this morning, as he had something of importance to com municate to me. 2. My remarks upon the evidence now recorded, as well as the further statements of Pedro DeSouza and Abdoolla Mahomed, are appended; and from what has now occurred, 1 am under the impression that in course of time the prisoner, Faizoo, will confess all he knows of the matter. Remarks by the Resident. O n the morning of Monday, November 23rd, 1874, the Resident was in formed by the Havildar of the Treasury Guard that the prisoner, Faizoo Ramzan, was desirous of making a statement. The prisoner was therefore at once sent for and examined regarding the statement which he professed a wish to make. 40(?6 The prisoner's examination is attached. From this examination it will be seen that the prisoner's motive in volun teering his statement obviously is to divert suspicion from himself by laying it on the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam. The prisoner notices as a suspicious circumstance, which it undoubtedly was, the unusually early attendance at the Hesidency of the Arab Sowar Salam on the morning of Monday the 9th, but he professes to be utterly unable to explain it. The prisoner, however, volunteered certain information regarding Salam's occupation and antecedents, which tends to explain the ground for suspicion in the prisoner's mind. It is noticeable, however, that the prisoner has utterlv repudiated his own connection with Salam, which is notorious, and which con stitutes one of the main grounds of suspicion against himself. The Resident was particularly struck with one of the answers given by the prisoner, in which he states that ever since the Resident returned/row Nowsaree in May last, Salam had never been to his room at the Residency. The allusion by the prisoner to the Resident's return from Nowsaree ap pears to have much significance, as it was entirely spontaneous has never been spoken of in his presence, and tends to confirm the Resident's suspicion that Vide paragraph 2G of Confidential the COllSpirclCV to poison llim Was chiefly COUCOCted Report, No. 379-1271. dated 17th during his residence at Nowsaree in the month of ' m '' HrlS/4 April and May last, when the prisoners Faizoo Ramzan and the Hamul Govind Baloo were both left together in charge of the Residency, and may have passed as much of their time as they chose in^the city. On being pressed regarding the spontaneous allusion to the Resident's return from Nowsaree, the prisoner volunteered the extraordinary statement that he forbad Salam from coming to him, but on further pressing the prisoner as to the reason for forbidding his coming, he stated after much prevarication that Salam was never in the habit of coming to him at all. The prisoner also denied emphatically that on the morning of Mondav, the 9th, he ever went into the dining-room at all. As he was seen to l?o into the dining-room by two witnesses, Abdoolla and Runchod Mussal, and as the dining- room is only 15 paces distant from the Resident's private office room, the signi ficance of this denial is obvious. Had the prisoner gone into the dining-room as he is shown to have done, he could easily have gone into the Resident's private office room by the back road outside the Residency without bein'- seen by any one except the llamal Govind Baloo if in the room at the time, which it appears from his own statement he was. The prisoner denies emphatically that he saw Madhowrao Sowar on the morning of Monday, the 9th, although he saw Yeshwant Rao Jassood and the Arab Sowar meet the Assistant Resident on his return to the Resi dency on the morning of Monday, November 9th. The Assistant Resident states 'that Madhowrao Sowar was present with Yeshwant Rao Jassood and Salam when he returned to the Residency. As Madhowrao Sowar died suddenly under verv suspicious circumstances shortly after the attempt was made to poison the Resident, the denial of the prisoner that he saw him on the morning when the attempt was made is most suspicious. It will also be observed that the accused acknowledges that he has no expenses in the Camp Bazaar, thus the one hundred rupees found in his box on the 9th cannot reasonably be accounted for. The fact that the prisoner Faizoo Ramzan himself volunteered the statement that he suspected the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam in consequence of the unusually early attendance of the latter at the Residency on the morning in question, the Resident has been induced to enquire more narrowly into the time that the prisoner himself came on duty on the morning of Monday, November 9th. Note .—In the accused's examination of 11th November 1874, he dis tinctly denied having even seen the Assistant Resident return from shoot ing, or having been seen speaking to the Arab Sowar Salam. 41 11The result of this enquiry is to establish the fact that the prisoner himself as well as Salam came on duty at a singularly early hour on the mormnsr in question. Faizoo Eamzan was seen by the Resident's butler, Pedro de Souz'i on his way to the Residency from the city about 6-20 a.m . Paizoo Ilamzan shortly afterwards went into the dispense-khana where Abdoolla and Bnnchod Jiussa! were employed about 6-30. From there he went into the dinine-room and about lOminutes later he returned to the dispense-khana, and then left the house. Abdoolla states that on days when Faizoo Ilamzan came from the city he did not usually arrive at the Residency till about 7-30 or 8 o'clock and he lias never known him arrive so early from the citv as he did on the morn in- m question. It is also a most significant fact that Faizoo Ramzan and Salam were at the Residency about the same time, 6-30 a.m ., on the morning in ques- lZ; ih V;r y ea , l - V atteI I , ? an .^ of tlle latte1, excited the attention of at hast one of the peons, Rowjee Havildar, and has now been spontaneouslv adduced by the prisoner Faizoo Ramzan himself as a ground for suspicion against balam in order to divert attention from himself. It will be seen however, that there are precisely the same grounds for suspecting Faizoo Ram-' zan as for suspecting Salara.

Pedro deSouza is recalled and further examined :— Question.—When you first saw Faizoo coming from the direction of the city on the morning of Monday the 9th, can you state accurately what o'clock it was ? Answer.—I did not look at my watch before I went out that morning. The sun had not long risen, but from its height it might have risen about 15 minutes. Q.—When you first saw Paizoo how far oif was he ? A.—He was about 200 paces off. I am quite certain that it was Faizoo and no one else. I went across to the Post Office only, and then returned. On my return I saw him, Faizoo, by the servants' quarters going to his room. I went into the cook-room and did not see him afterwards. When I returned from the Post Office I saw Salam, the Arab Sowar, standing near the place where the peons sit. It took me about 10 or 15 minutes to go to the Post Office and back. Faizoo sometimes comes late and sometimes early. I have told him that if he did not come in good time, I should^ speak about it to the Sahib. On the morning in question he came in good time. This evidence having been read over to the witness in Ilindoostanee, a language which he understands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Before me this 23rd day of November 1874. (Sd.) K. P hayre, Col. Resident. Further examination. Abdoolla Mahomed is recalled and further examined :— W hen I saw Faizoo go into the dining-room it was about 6-30 a. m . He returned from the direction of the dining-room about 10 minutes afterwards, and went out of the house. After the Sahib had returned about 7 o'clock, Faizoo came into the dispense-khana to clean the silver. I remember when Faizoo came into the dispense-khana, because I saw the Sahib's horse pass as usual until Faizoo came into the dispense-khana that morning about 7 o'clock to clean the silver. I did not see him do any work at all. ^ W hen Faizoo sleeps in the city he usually does not return to duty till about 7-30 or 8 a. m . Faizoo slept in the city on the night of Sunday, November 8th. On Monday morning when he came from the city he came unusually early. I have never seen him come from the city so early before as he did on that 44 Exd.—J. M,morning. When Faizoo went into the dining room on the morning of Monday all the doors were open. This examination having been read over to the witness in Hindostanee, a language which he understands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Before me, this 23rd day of November 1874. (Sd.) E,.

Gonne , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 7092, dated the 26th ultimo, forwarding a copy of papers relating to the recent attempt to poison Colonel Phayre, late Resident at Baroda, and to state that the Govern ment of India will await further information on the subject.

A dverting to paragraph 6 of the enclosure No. 2 5 63P., dated 25th ultimo, to your Office letter to my address, No. 2564P. of the same date, concerning an investigation into the recent attempt to poison Colonel Phayre, I have the honor to report— 2. \st. —That I learn from Colonel Phayre that he has already submitted to the Government of Bombay the proceedings he has taken in the case, together with a letter on the subject No. 379-1271 of 17th November 1874. Ind. —It seems to me that it would be extremely inexpedient that I should enquire into the matter. To do so would inevitably embarrass me in my relations with the Baroda Durbar, or with the Resident, or with both. 3. I have to-day telegraphed to the Government of Bombay requesting that if the services of their Commissioner of Police, Mr. Souter, can be spared for a few days, he may be instructed to make the necessary arrangements and join me at Baroda. 4. On his arrival I should wish him to make a searching Police enquiry into all the circumstances of the case. Indeed, I think, it is to be regretted such enquiry was not instituted immediately after the attempt. 5. On receipt of the report of the Commissioner of Police, I shall be in a position either to cause a Magisterial enquiry to be made, if the Commissioner deem such course advisable, or to transmit the Commissioner's report for the further orders of Government. 6. Should a Magisterial enquiry have place, and the Magistrate consider the evidence of a character likely to sustain a prosecution, it will then become my duty to solicit the favor of' His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- Generaf in Council, causing Notification to be made in conformity with the provisions of Section 5 of the Extradition Act Xo.

Aitchison , Esq., C .S .I., Secy, to the .Govt, of India, Foreign Dept. I havis the honor to report that in obedience to the instructions contained in your Office No. 2564P. of 25th November, and accompaniment, I proceeded to Bombay reporting my arrival there on the 29th ultimo. On the 4th instant I arrived at Baroda ; and on the 5tli took charge from the Resident. His Highness the Gaekwar visited me on the morning of the 5th. On the evening of the same day I had an interview with His H ighness at his Palace, and presented to him the khureeta of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General in Council dated 25th ultimo. This morning (7th) Colonel Phayre left Earoda, and I caused all the usual honors to be paid him on the part of the British and Gaekwar authorities. After Colonel Phayre's departure, the Gaekwar, unaccompanied by any suite, paid me a friendly visit at the Residency. His Highness was demon strative in volunteering assurances that he would absolutely and without any delay conform to whatever adviee I might afford, and thoroughly, as well in deed as in word, carry into effect the requirements of the Viceroy's khureeta and instructions of the 25th July last. I responded in a friendly and earnest manner, explaining to His Highness how averse His Excellency the Viceroy was from causing misfortune to any Native Prince. But, I added, that in the present instance I should fail to perform a most serious duty were I to attempt to soften, or conceal the mean ing and intention of the Viceroy in writing the khureeta of the 25th ultimo, and deputing his Agent for Rajpootana to represent him at Baroda. I more particularly (bvelt on the words of His Excellency &lt;c I have now done every thing in my power to aid Your Highness.' Both His Highness and his Minister have assured me that they well understand the portentous significance of the khureeta and appointment of an Agent to the Governor-General, and that all the instructions of July 25th shall be forthwith carried into effect. I further explained to the Minister that although in the instructions of July 25th the report of the Resident w r as to be submitted not later than 31st December 1875, yet that affairs had marched and in some respects altered since those instructions were issued; that His Excellency in now again address ing His Highness and in deputing his own Agent to His Highness' Court would, in large measure, be influenced by the reports of his Agent; and that, for my own part, while I was on the one hand frankly and most sincerely desirous of aiding the Gaekwar through the present most grave crisis, I was equally, on the other hand, resolved that in the unhappy event of my being driven to a conviction of His Highness' incorrigibility, I would submit to His Excellency the A iceroy and Governor-General in Council my unqualified advice to decline longer to sacrifice the interests of the Baroda State, in order to maintain in power an unworthy ruler. ^ esterday the IVIinister spent many hours with me in going over all the points contained in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the instructions of 25th July, and both His Highness and the Minister have this morning informed me that I shall These letters have been received. during to-day receive fl 'Om HlS HighneSS Written (sa.) l. p. communications drawn up in exact conformity with the advice I afforded, and further expressive of willingness that I shall satisfy myself of the reality of the assurances tendered. 1 have spoken thus plainly, although with great gentleness at an early date, because I think the sooner the real situation is understood bv all here the better will it be for all concerned. 46lie Resident assures me that almost every letter or document of importance v&gt; Inch passes between the Residency and the Governments of Bombay and India, is sooner or later known to the Durbar; and if they now find opportunity tor perusing my despatches, they will speedily learn that I sincerely wish His Highness avc II , and that I discharge my duties here with complete impartialitv, and a \ it h every due consideration and allowance for any real difficulties that may embarrass His Highness' position. The Durbar will further find that, if I once become thoroughly convinced that His Highness is incorrigible, I will permit no unnecessary delay in submitting to the Viceroy in Council a solemn recommendation that the (Jackwar State be saved by the deposal of its Ruler, and the inaugaration of a minority or other mode of Government under suitable conditions.

Going on my political report of the 7th with Appendix, let Aitchison and Law Officer comment thereon, and if they approve it as a Stateindictment, remove Gaekwar and say nothing about ultimate judicial inten tions. iuen place English officials in power and instruct me to report the measures I advise for bringing Jemadar and others to justice, addin- that it cannot be expected full judicial evidence could be collected so long as Gaekwar and his friends were in power. Then give time, and it is highly probable matter ot unexpected character will come out. But if we adopt half measures, witnesses may be frightened out of evidence and may even give false. Public opinion here will wholly support removal of Gaekvvar, treating the question so tar as he is concerned politically. The summary brought against him in mv report, his antecedents and those of State (?) amply warrant taking Baroda under direct charge; but if you (?) hesitate or enact half measures Baroda subjects (?) wil withhold all they know. Souter joins Your Excellency on Monday. V\ ith reference to my letter, kindly weigh report written (?) quickly but tho roughly fairly by me. Send troops one day before you remove, and order me to prevent State intrigues, malversation, and purloining. I have no anxiety provided we act firmly as paramount power, fulfilling obligation to protected State and our own Government. My deferential and deliberate opinion is removal of Ruler; prisoner of independent State on State considerations is prefer- a lie to suspension pending the judicial enquiry, under jurisdiction of which I have not cognizance.

From— Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly , K.C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General and Special Commissioner of Baroda, To—C. U. Aitchison , Esq., C.S.I., Secy, to the Govt, of India, Foreign Dept. U nder paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Government of India letter Ncr. 2563P. of the 25th November 1874, which accompanied your letter of instructions to me, No. 2564P. of the same date, I was informed that it would be my ' first duty' after receiving charge of my office at Baroda ' to bring to a conclusion,' 'or to recommend the measures that he (I) consider to be necessary for the purpose of' concluding an investigation into ' the atrocious attempt to poison Colonel Phayre,' in view to bringing ' the authors of the attempt' to ' con dign punishment.' 2. Accordingly on the day on which I commenced work, I telegraphed to the Government of Bombay requesting that the services of their Commissioner of Police might be placed at my disposal, and that he might be instructed to make the necessary arrangements and join me at Baroda. 53 14O r. rto cimp &lt;lav I submitted a letter No. 413-1376 of 7th December 1874 sketehing the mode of procedure I proposed to follow and in your (Jffice liter No 2801 of 19th idem, His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-Qeneral fn Council was pleased to approve my proceedings 4 I found that the late Resident had himself instituted an enquiry, and , ^ or had reported the result m his letter o. • I have not received the honor o any py » Qf7Q T 971 nf 1 7f]i ^OVPTllher* 1874 It acknowledgment of, Colonel Phayre's report. 3 /9-1^/1 Ot 17U1 .l\0\ 0mi3( l \ i K. 11 (Sd.) lewis pellt , did not appear that Colonel i hayre had A.

Yellapa Nursoo. 5 Mr. Souter commenced the enquiry de novo on the 10th December 1874 and down to the 22iid idem the proceedings continued to he oi an ordinary police character, with which I carefully abstained from intervention, unless on the direct request of the Commissioner. ^ 6. On the 22nd December, however, one Rowjee, the Havildar of Peons at the Residency, made some admissions to the Inspector of Police, Khan Eahadoor Akhar Ali tending to criminate himself, and directly to implicate 11 is 1 Iighness the Gaekwar in the attempt to poison. This the Commissioner of l olice re- norted to me on the early morning of the 23rd, and as the proceedings fiom us point onward assumed a political aspect, I took a more direct interest in them. 7 Durino- the forenoon of the 23rd I heard Rowjee repeat his statement before'the Commissioner of Police, and his manner and language impressed me as beinf those of a man endeavouring to speak the truth. At the same time I bore in mind that Rowjee was confessing under a promise of pardon, and that a statement so made before the Police was of little or no ^alue unless corroborated by circumstantial or other evidence. 8 On the morning of the 24th His Highness the Gaekwar paid me his usual visit, and I then, in the presence of Mr. Souter, mentioned to His High ness that his name had been introduced as having been directly concerned m the attempt to poison the late Resident, and that my advice to him was to afford every facility for a searching enquiry into the facts of the case, llns His Highness promised to do. 9. On the same morning I learnt from the Commissioner oi Police that the Jemadar of Peons, named Nursoo, had made a confession without promise of pardon, and that his confession generally corroborated that ot the Havildar. 10. Desirous of leaving no room for subsequent doubt as to the condi tions under which the Jemadar might have made his confession, 1 entered the room where the enquiry was about to be proceeded with, and solemnly warned the Jemadar that he must clearly understand before his statement \Aas taken down in writing, that I not only would not promise him pardon, but that he should not be pardoned. This warning I caused to be repeated to the Jemada^. 11. The Jemadar then placed his turban at my feet, and said the Sahib may hang or kill me, but I must speak it all out. I have served the Govern ment for so many years, and now having gone into this matter, how can I ever show my face again. I asked him what could have induced him so to commit himself,and whether Colonel Phayre had ever treated him ill ? The Jemadar rejoin ed that Colonel Phayre had always been good to him, but that he had been so entreated to go to the palace that he had at length consented to go there, and that intrigue had then gradually developed from a mission to collect intorma- tion to one involving an attempt at poisoning. 12. The Jemadar then confessed in my presence to the effect recorded in Fwfc Appendices to Mr. Souter's re- his Statement UOW enclosed, and CC ltailllv i10111 P 0lfc - condition of overwhelming grief, from his tone, 5455 liis manner, his language, and from the general concurrence of his statement with that ol the Havildar whom he had not comimmicated with, he induced in my mind a conviction that he was a man of somewhat stupid nature, who had been led into an atrocious conspiracy, and was unable, under mingled feel ings of shame, dejection, and horror, any longer to refrain from disburthening himself of his crime. 13. The Jemadar was remanded to the guard-room, and his confession was not recorded until the 26th December. 14. On the afternoon of the 26th when I was dressing for my evening drive in an upper room in the Eesidency, I chanced to see the Jemadar, accom panied by a policeman, cross the lawn into the Residency garden; and a few minutes afterwards my attention was attracted by a disturbance in the garden, and by the sound of voices calling for a rope and assistance. 15. On going downstairs I enquired into the cause of the disturbance, and shortly afterwards the Jemadar dripping wet and guarded passed the verandah. I went out to him, and asked what was the matter, when the police explained that the Jemadar had thrown himself into the well, and had been recovered with great difficulty. I desired that he might be wrapped up in a warm blanket, and I then questioned him as to his reason for thus acting, and also as to whether he had received any ill-treatment or annoyance. He replied that he had not received any annoyance, but that after concluding his confes sion, he had gone to the garden, that he was confused, and that he had thrown himself into the well. He then repeated his former ejaculations as to the impossibility of his ever showing his face again, of his long service, and of his remorse for what had happened. 16. On the following morning I again saw the Jemadar in the guard-room as a complaint had reached me from his brother to tlie effect that the Police were annoying him. I took the brother with me to the guard-room, and in his presence again enquired of the Jemadar as to his treatment. He replied that his brother's petition was unfounded, and was due to gossip in the town. The Jemadar in the presence of his brother again reiterated his expressions of remorse and hopelessness. 17. I have thus dwelt on the above details because they chanced to come under my own eye, and have largely contributed towards convincing me that the statements of the Jemadar and Rowjee are true, and are not the result ot a conspiracy. 18. But it is not my intention to trouble His Excellency in Council with a complete analysis of all the corroborative or circumstantial evidence adduced in the case. This has been professionally done by Mr. Scoble, the Advocate- General, Bombay, in a letter to my address, which I beg to enclose in original, as also a copy of a letter addressed by me to Mr. Scoble to which his is the reply. I have to thank Mr. Scoble for the promptitude with which he pro ceeded to Baroda, and for his valuable advice during his sojourn here. 19. I enclose also an original report .by Mr. Souter, the Commissioner of Police. This report encloses a printed copy of the evidence taken in the case, and is accompanied by numerous Appendices. 20. I trust that His Excellency in Council may concur with me in think ing that the inquiry conducted by Mr. Souter has been carried through with great care, patience, and success. Mr. Souter in his 6th paragraph correctly comments on the difficulties attending the inquiry, and I quite agree with him in his estimate of the difficulties; and, as i reported on the 7th ultimo, I deem it to be matter for regret that Colonel Phayre did not in the first instance apply for Police assistance, instead ot conducting the inquiry himself. 20a. Mr. Souter's report will doubtless be carefully perused at Calcutta, and it is therefore unnecessary that I should occupy the time of Government by further comment on it.21. In his 3rd paragrapli the Commissioner of Police brings to notice the names of his subordinates employed in ferreting out the facts of this curious case, and I have been much impressed by the zeal, industry, and astuteness of these officials (and this without any use of force or threat) in detecting the culprits. I recommend Rao Bahadoor Gujanund Vittul to the favor of Govern ment, also Khans Bahadoor Meer Akbar Ali Khan and Meer Abdool Ali. 22. Having thus, in obedience to your telegram of the 30th ultimo, Ask Advocate-Qeuerai to come at ^closed the opinion of the Advocate-General and once to Baroda and advise in the case. tllC report 01 the Commissioner of Police, together Please send all evidence with Sou- ^ the eviden Ce taken in the CaSC, it UOW becomes ter's report, with your opinion and my grave duty to submit my own opinion ; and, in doin g so ' f ^ ^ the case in its political aspects, and with special reference to the circum stances and alleged complicity of His Highness the Gaekwar. 23.

They must be considered— 1^.—-In connection with the antecedents of His Highness, remote and prox imate ; 2wf/.

Considering the case in connection with the antecedents of His High ness, the records of the Baroda Residency show that this is the third occasion whereon His Highness' name has become publicly associated with attempts to poison btate personages. The two previous alleged attempts were against the persons of— D 1st. His Highness' deceased brother and sovereign the late Khundav Rao Gaekwar. 2nd.

Rumour alleges that the above are not the only instances of capital crime committed or abetted by His Highness.

Mr. Dadabhoy, a Minister trained in our own schools nR ' Exd. J. M.has more than once lamented to me that his administration has been cramped, harassed, and in some instances brought into contempt owing to all classes of the community entertaining a conviction that the Residency was a sort of Court of appeal against the Durbar. 27. In respect to the moral certainty strong moral probability of the facts themselves : after— A perusal of the evidence and other details recorded ; 2nd. Personally witnessing the manner in which the principal statements were made, and also some of the incidents accompanying the delivery of those statements ; Maturely and to the best of my ability weighing the direct and in dependent corroborative evidence adduced ; and Mh, After considering the report of the Commissioner of Police and the opinion of the Advocate-General; I am of opinion that the statements recorded are not the result of a con spiracy; that they are substantially true; and that they involve the admission that His Highness was directly concerned in an attempt to poison the late Resi dent, Colonel Phayre. 28. I am further of opinion that the evidence taken in connection with what was previously on record in this Residency shows that the attempt was not the result of a sudden and unpremeditated impulse, but was the final deve lopment of feelings of anger and eventually of exasperation, excited by the pro ceedings of the Resident, and which culminated on the part of the Gaekwar in attempts first to appease, next to seduce, then to exercise, then to expel, and finally to poison the British Representative at his Court. 2 ( ,). I come now to the third point, that of considering the case in refer ence to the mutual relations subsisting between a protected Native State and a paramount Imperial power. It is on record that ' from the earliest period of its vide the viceroy's kimreeta to the connection with the Baroda State the British Gaekwar. dated 25th July 1874. Government has repeatedly found it necessary to intervene its Baroda affairs **, for example by investing the Resident with power of control over its finances; by assuming for a time the management of portions of the State, and by the removal of evil-advisers.' 30. The Commission assembled at Baroda last year established ' so serious an amount of general misgovernment' on the part of His Highness as ' to vide Govermnent of India letter, dated necessitate decided intervention on the part of 2511. July 1874. t | ie British Government.' The details of this mal-administration are amply given in the report of the Commission or in its Appendices. It may be sufficient here to recall that among ' gross abuses' charged against His Highness' Government were: the ' discreditable and spoliatory,' ' arbitrary and unjust' treatment of bankers and traders ; the ' arbitrary' and dan gerously sudden reductions made among he military class; the practice of ' barbarous processes' in ' realizing revenue ;' ' the levy of nuzzerana on ap pointments ;' the practice of ' torture' on the part of 'subordinate officials ;' ' scandalously excessive punishment' for crime; ' the abduction of women for forced labor in the Polace,' thereby ' bringing' a most serious scandal on the personal character of the Chief himself; the personal ill-treatment and ' corporal punishment of women;' 'the vindictive treatment of the rela tives and dependents of the late Chief.' 31. My own observation here has assured me that the cultivating classes are discontented to an unusual degree, and were until recently in a state of Vide my Report No. 433-1431 of 19th alm0St resistance to tllC Collection of the December 1874. revenue. Again the nobles were, until my recent cember 1874^° 440 1472 of 27th ^ interview with them, in combination against the authority of His Highness. Until purged by the administration of Mr. Dadabhoy, the criminal and civil administration of justice was notoriously venal and corrupt. The general voice of the community was 57 15loud in condemnation of His Eiglmess 1 extravagant expenditure on himself, bis favorites and his Palaces. It appeared that during the past year His High ness had thus expended seventy (70) lakhs of rupees, while the total revenue real ized l.v the State aggregated only ninety-four lakhs (94). Again, I found our own officials employed in districts adjacent to the borders of the Baroda State, almost unanimous in their accusations of bad neighbourhood on the part of the Gaek- war Affain, it is matter of general notoriety that Baroda and its purlieus are the resort of bad characters and intriguers. Again, there is the present scanda lous violation of the rights of hospitality and of the immunities attaching to the person of a foreign representative, in respect to the attempt on the life of the late Resident. ^Again, there is the fact that three previous representatives of the British Government at Baroda either were Williams, Sutherland. Outram. ^ W ere supposed to be aimed at by means of poison. 32. I do not mean to say that in all the above instances the Gaekwar or his State was wholly in the wrong. As little do I attribute wholly and solely to His Highness the condition of confusion, partizanship, intrigue, crime, and comparative paralyzation of the executive, to which affairs have been reduced. On the contrary, I am of opinion that in some of the acts of reform, for which His Highness has been condemned, the Prince may have intended well while his underlings perverted his intentions in administering. Again, it is obvious that the present crisis is the result of misgovernment under more than one ruler. Again, the disturbance in prices and in rents caused by the abnormal rise in the price of cotton during the rebellion in the United States has proved an element of disorder. Again, we ourselves may have made some mistakes in respect to our proceedings and relations with the Baroda State, and finally I am confident that at the present time His Highness is sincerely anxious to follow our advice and reform his administration. 33. Nevertheless, on a general and dispassionate review of the whole case, considered in its political bearings under the three heads above enumerated I am of opinion that the complicity of His Highness in the recent attempt to poison, taken in connection with His Highness' personal antecedents, and with the heretofore general and protracted maladministration of the State, renders „ XT ^ it obligatory on me to accept the alternative which My No. 415-1378 of the 7th ultimo. ^ , 1 , •, M-i. i x j - xv I recently alluded to as a possibility, and to aiiteren- tially submit to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council my ' solemn recommendation that the Gaekwar State be saved by the deposal from power of its Ruler, and by the inauguration of a minority or other mode of government under suitable conditions.' Dated Baroda, 5tb Junuary 1875. From— Hon'ble Andrew R. Scoble , Advocate-General, Bombay, 'i 0 —Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly, K.C.S.I., Agent, Governor-General, &amp;c. &amp;c. I n obedience to your request I have the honor to submit the following observations upon the evidence now available with regard to the recent attempt to poison Colonel Phayre, the Resident at Baroda. It appears to be clear from the reports of Colonel Phayre, Dr. Seward and Dr. (iray (the Chemical Analyzer to Government) that on the morning of the 9th November 1874, white arsenic and some siliceous substance (which it is suggested was daimond dust) were introduced into Colonel Phayre's sherbet, and that alter taking a few sips of the beverage. Colonel Phayre was attacked by the symptoms usually produced by the swallowing of poison. The small quantity of sherbet taken, however, fortunately prevented any fatal or even serious effect. No satislactory evidence as to the person by whom this poison was administered appears to have been obtained until the latter part of December by 5859 which time Colonel Phayre had left Baroda. The enquiries made under your direction by Mr. Souter (Commissioner of Police, Bombay) have led to disclosures, which I shall now proceed to summariez. Those disclosures though not made upon oath, appear to have been obtained under circumstances which leave no doubt as to their reliability, and may, I think, be treated as entitled to the same weight as sworn depositions. From the statements made by the witnesses examined by Mr. Souter, three results, in my opinion, clearly follow :— 1. That for many months prior to November last there had been a systematic and successful attempt to induce various members of Colonel Phayre's household to betray their duty to their master. 2. That the purpose for which Colonel Phayre's servants were thus suborned was twofold—to obtain information of what went on at the Besidency ; to get rid of the Resident. 3. That the individual by whom the intrigue was conducted was His Highness the Gaekwar himself. The statement of the ayah Ameena, the Chobdar Paizoo Ramzan, the Naik of Peons, Sheikh Kurreem, the Ilavildar Rowjee, and the Jemadar Nursoo, which I am informed were all taken separately and without -the possibility of communication between the deponents, prove a number of interviews at different times between these various servants of the Resident and the Gaekwar himself, the particulars of which need not be here recounted. There can I imagine be no doubt as to their identification of the Gaekwar as the person Avith whom these interviews took place. From their employment at the Residency, they would have frequent opportunities of seeing His Highness with whose features and appearance they would be perfectly familiar. That they at various times went to the Palace at night is proved by the cart-drivers Sheikh Dawood and Karbliai Poonjabhai, the boy Chootoo, and the punka- pullers Jugga Bhugwan, and Kabhai Amer Sing. Their admission that they received money from the Gaekwar's servants Yeshwunt Rao and Salam is corroborated by Shaikh, Abdoolla and Jugga. That Rowjee had what for him were considerable sums at command at the time of the alleged payments is shown by the evidence of the bricklayer Dajeeba and the goldsmiths, Sheolal Wittul and Doolub Meenor. That the the avail was in communication with the Gaekwar, Yeshwuntrao and Salam, is established by the letters which passed between her and her husband, and which were found in her house ; and Rowjee's statement that he undertook to furnish information as to what was going on at the Residency is confirmed by Jugga and by the news-letters found in Salam's house, one of which isin Jugga's handwriting. From the evidence above recapitulated it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that His Highness the Gaekwar had established through his servants, Yeshwuntrao and Salam, confidential relations with the Residency servants, and had secured their services by gifts and promises. To what extent those services were to be rendered is in some degree less clearly established. The avail's story story that she was first asked to use her good offices with the mistress on the Gaekw ar's behalf; that afterwards jadoo or sorcery was talked about, and that ultimately poison was mentioned, seems to me highly probable on the face of it, and denotes the steps by which the scheme would naturally be carried out. It may be objected that on her first examination she said nothing about poison, and if her evidence stood alone, not much reliance could be pro- perlv placed on it. But she is corroborated as to the fact of poison having been mentioned at one of her interviews with the Gaekwar by her husband Sheik Abdoolla, and though in the case of an ordinary criminal trial her account to a third partv in the absence of the Gaekwar of what had passed between her and the Gaekwar would not be admitted in evidence against him, I think for present purposes it may be considered as corroborating the truthfulness of her supplementary statement.The evidence however upon which the complicity of the Gaekwar in the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre mainly if not exclusively rests, is that of the Havildar Rowjee and the Jemadar Nursoo. The statement of Rowjee was made after promise of pardon and is therefore open to suspicion. But when Nursoo made his statement, no such hopes were held out to him and he was in ignorance of what Rowjee had said. More than this he had been expressly in formed by yourself that he would not be pardoned; and his ignorance of any plot except that in which he was himself concerned, and notably of the intrigue with the ayah, which he nowhere mentions, may, I think, be taken to support his accuracy in regard to the transactions as to which he speaks. Reading the two statements of Rowjee and Nursoo together in the light of these considera tions it is impossible not to be struck with their correspondence in all material particulars; and the impression produced on my mind is that their story is true. Of course these men are accomplices one of the other, and it is a well known rule of English practice that it is not safe to act on the uncorroborated testimoney of an accomplice and that one accomplice cannot directly corro borate another. But by Section 133 of the Indian Evidence Act it is provided that a conviction is not illegal because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. From the nature of the case independent corroborative testimony as to the Gaekwar's connivance in the scheme to poison Colonel Phayre is unattain able. All who were privy to the scheme were accomplices in it. Whether Yeshwunt Rao and Salam, when put on their trial will admit the truth of the statements made by Rowjee and Nursoo cannot be known, but were the parties to the nefarious plot merely private individuals, I should have no hesitation in pronouncing the evidence already recorded sufficient to warrant a conviction. I presume however that the case, so far as the Gaekwar is concerned, will be dealt with politically. There is no tribunal but the executive Government before which a Soveregin Prince can be arraigned for such an offence as is here laid to his charge, and I conceive it is unnecessary for me to say more than I have done in reference to the evidence so far as it affects His Highness. With regard to Yeshwunt Rao, Salam, and Nursoo, the offence for which they should be tried is abetment of an attempt to murder by poison, under Sections 107 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code. Upon their trial the evidence of the ayah. Sheikh Kureem, Karbhai Ameer Sing, Fyzoo Ramzan and Jugga will be admissible to prove the connection of Yeshwunt Rao and Salam with the earlier stage of the conspiracy. Against the Jemadar Nursoo no evidence beyond his own confession will be necessary. When convicted he may be called as a withness against his co-defendant. The only defence which it seems to me could be set up by any of the parties implicated is that this is a ' Police case;' that the witnesses have been tutored by the Police, and are merely saying what they have been told to say. Your own acquaintance with the history of this enquiry, and with the manner in which Mr. Souter and his Assistants have pursued their investigation, will supply the best answer to any suggestion of this kind. Indeed to my mind one of the strongest proofs of the truth of the story told by the witnesses is furnished by a study of the circumstances under which the various statements were made, and of the minor incidents by which the progress of the enquiry was characterized. No. 1479, dated Baroda, 29th December 1874. From— Col. Sir Lewis Felly, K.C.S.I., Agent, Governor-General, and Special Commissioner, Baroda, To— Hon^ble A. Scoble , Advocate-General, Bombay. I had the honor this morning of transmitting to you the subjoined telegram :— ' Can you receive Mr. Souter to-morrow morning on important business. If so, kindly have note specifying time awaiting his arrival at his house.' e pd .—j. d. g. 60(35) 2. The business referred to concerns the recent attempt to poison the late Resident at Baroda. 3. Mr. Souter, the Commissioner of Police, will submit to you the statements which have been taken before him in the matter, and I should feel obliged if you would favour me with your opinion on these statements in general, and more particularly on the question whether the direct and corroborative matter in these statements preclude any reasonable or moral doubt of the complicity of His Highness the Gaekwar in the said attempt. ^ have requested Mr. Souter to return to Baroda at his earliest convenience, in order that I may submit the case to the Government of India without delay. From— Frank H. Soutee , Esq., C.S.I., Commissioner of Police, Bombay, To— Col. Sir Lewis Pelly, K .C.S .L, Agent, Governor-General, and Special Com missioner, Baroda. O n the afternoon of the 6th December 1874 I received an official letter Can services of Mr. Souter be spared for a few frOlU Go\einmcnt in the Political Depai't- days. If so, please request him, make arrangements, ment forwarding COpV of VOUr telegram and meet me Baroda. a i j , , to them ol the same date entered in the margin, and directing me to join you at Baroda. I left Bombay on the 9th, and having received your instructions I now have the honor to submit a report showing the result of my enquiries into the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre, the late Resident of Baroda, on the 9th November 1874. 2. I should have left by the train on the morning following the receipt of my instructions, but knowing the nature of the service for which I was required I thought it better to select and organize a detective staff to accom pany me, and therefore I remained in Bombay on the 8th for this purpose and started for Baroda by the mail train on the morning of the 9th December. 3. Before quitting Bombay I applied to Government requesting that the services of the Police Inspector of Ahmedabad, Rao Bahadoor Gujanand Vittul Shastree, might be placed at my disposal, and that he might be directed to join me at Baroda forthwith. I may mention that this officer had done excellent service under me in the Southern Mahratta Country at the time of the mutinies, and as he had been for many years in Police charge of the city of Ahmedabad, between which place and Baroda there is always so much intercourse and traffic, I felt sure that, with his local knowledge and high Police qualifications, he would prove a valuable aid to me in the enquiry I was about to institute under your direction. 4. I took with me from Bombay my Chief Detective Officers, Inspectors, Khan Bahadoor Meer Akbar Ali, and Khan Bahadoor Meer Abdool Ali with a few selected Policemen of different grades, and the Rao Bahadoor joined me the day after my arrival at Baroda with some of his trusted men and agents from Ahmedabad. 5. After receiving your instructions I lost no time in assembling my men and making such arrangements in consultation with them, as appeared best calculated to obtain intelligence and to secure secret information of a nature likely to throw light on the serious matter which had been entrusted to me to unravel, and which it therefore became my important duty to enquire into in the most searching and thorough manner. 6. The detectives commenced their work under most unfavorable and disadvantageous circumstances; poisoning is a class of crime always difficult to detect, but in the present case it was rendered doubly so— 1st. —From the unfortunate fact that a whole month had been permitted to elapse before calling in the aid of the Police. 2ndly. —Because the country and its people were foreign to the detectives. 61 16Srdly. —Inability on the part of the Police to take immediate action in consequence of the Earoda city being foreign territory. Uhly. —The great fear that people had in coming forward with information. Wily. —The extraordinary efforts used, and enormous sums of money available to remove all evidence and to destroy every clue likely to lead to the detection of the persons who attempted this daring crime. 7. It was impossible for the detectives themselves to go into, and about the city of Baroda without exciting suspicion, and their movements and actions being closely watched, they were obliged to work almost entirely by means of agents, through whom much useful information was obtained, but nothing of a tangible nature came to light until the 16th December, on which day the detectives succeeded in getting hold of the driver of a hack bullock shigram in the Camp Bazaar, who, it was ascertained, had on one occasion driven an ayah, at the time in service at the Residency, to the Gaekwar's llavelee or Palace at a late hour of night: this I may say was the first useful clue the detectives were able to obtain, and their exertions now assumed a definite direction. 8. The shigram driver Dawood was at once brought before me, and after carefully questioning him, feeling satisfied of the correctness of his statement I took down his deposition recorded in the Appendix and lettered A. 9. It will be seen by reference to this statement that the ayah's husband Sheikh Abdoolla was said to have orderd the shigram in the first* instance, and that her servant boy Chotoo accompanied her to the Gaek war's palace. 10. With this information I caused the boy Chotoo and the husband Sheikh Abdoolla to be immediately taken up and brought to me separately, the boy at once admitted that he had gone at night with the ayah to the Maha raja's palace, and the husband also after some hesitation corroborated the statements of both the cart-driver Dawood, and the boy Chotoo. The deposi tions of Chotoo and Sheik Abdoolla are recorded in the Appendix and lettered B and D. 11. The ayah who had formerly been for some time iu the service of Mrs. Phayre, wife of the late Resident, was now employed by that lady's daughter, Mrs. Boevey. I found however thMt she was then suffering from fever and was confined to her bed; the house where she lived was some little distance from the Residency where as you know my enquiries have been conducted. I there fore arranged that the husband and boy should be detained separately at the Residency while I went personally to examine the ayah with regard to the accuracy of the statements already made. 12. Upon arriving at the ayah's house I had some conversation with her during which she most reluctantly admitted that she had been induced to visit the Gaekwar on three occasions. In consequence, however, of the avah being so unwell I was unwilling to put her to any unnecessary trouble, and there- tore I took the precaution to place a Police Guard over her house, so that she should have no communication with anybody, and on the 18th I took down the first part of her statement. She was then removed to hospital, and on the 19th the Residency Surgeon, Dr. Seward, who was attending her, called at the Resi dency and informed me that she had expressed a wish to see me as she had something further to say. I accordingly visited the hospital the following morning when the ayah voluntarily made the very important additional state ment regarding the poison which I took down at the hospital on the 21st. The ayah s two statements of the 18th and 21st December are shown in the Appendix lettered C. 13. AV ben the ayah made her first statement on the 16th December I caused her house to be guarded, thinking it possible that some documentarv evidence might be obtained. Upon search being made amongst other papers discovered in her box under lock and key, were four important letters attached m original to this report and numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Letters Nos 1 and 2 63were addressed by the ayah to her husband, the first directed to Baroda and se^iceas butlOT r ' t0 Which plaCe the ayah,S husband 1,ad S™' e 14.

These statements are most consistent one with the other, and to show beyond all doubt that the ayah had been corrupted, and had several times paid secret night visits to the Gaekwar who received her in person, that she had been paid liberal sums of money, and that an intrigue existed, tbe obieet of which was obvious, but will no doubt be better understood and more confidentlv believed when my entire report has been gone into. 18. While the detectives and their Agents were at work beyond the Residency I was daily engaged in going over and sifting the evidenci already taken by Colonel Phayre, with the object of ascertaining whether any of the domestic servants, or members of the Resident's establishment, had really taken part in this heinous cri »ac. Each servant was personally questioned by me and the result of my searching enquiry was to throw the strongest suspicion on the Havildar of Peons by name Rowjee bin Rama. It was brought to HWit that after all the servants had left Colonel Phayre's private room on the morning of 9th November, he was one of the last to come from it, and was afterwards seen sitting on a bench in the verandah, from which he could not only command the room itself, but could plainly see the table on which the glass of 'sherbet' had been placed. The Police also ascertained that for some time previous Rowjee had been spending considerable sums of money in the bazaar inmakino- up jewellery 63and in other ways, and on his being brought before me and examined his demeanour was so very suspicious that I immediately ordered him to be taken into custody: this was on the 22nd December, and so satisfied tvas I, as well as my detectives, that he was assuredly acquainted with the facts of the poisoning; that I agreed to a promise of pardon being offered to him on the distinct understanding and condition that he would divulge and truthfully state all that he knew in the matter. I very reluctantly adopted this course as a last resource, seeing that it was hopeless under all the difficulties the Police had to contend with to endeavour otherwise to throw light upon this case. Under this promise Rowjee confessed to me the same evening that he had himself administered the poison in Colonel Phayre's sherbet at the instigation of His Highness the Gaekwar. The following morning, as you will remember, I reported this fact to you when you caused the prisoner Rowjee to be brought before you, and after personally cautioning him, he made the detailed statement which I took down on the 24th, 25th, and 26th December recorded in the Appendix and lettered G. 19. This statement is briefly to the effect, that for considerably more than a year he, Rowjee, had been in the constant habit of paying secret night visits to the Gaekwar; that he had in the first instance been persuaded by Salim Arab Sowar, but was also invariably accompanied by the confidential Jasood Yeshwuut Rao Yeola ; that as requested by the Maharaja, he had from time to time personally, and by written reports, kept him regulajrly informed of all that transpired of interest to him at the Residency; that he had been instrumental in corrupting the Jemadar Nursoo and getting him to visit the Gaekwar with the same object; that he and the Jemadar had received from the Gaekwar, through Yeshwunt Rao and Salim, considerable sums of money at different times in consideration of the services thus rendered by them; that he had on four occasions visited the Gaekwar at night with Colonel Phayre's Butler Pedro; and that on the last occasion it had been suggested by the Maharaja, and agreed to by the Butler Pedro; that he should administer poison to his master; that a powder was given to him by the Gaekwar for this purpose, and that finally, after several unsuccessful plots to poison the Resident, he, Rowjee, and the Jemadar Nursoo had by appointment met Yeshwunt Rao and Salim at the Palace about 20 days before the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre was discovered, and that it was then deliberately planned and arranged by them and the Gaekwar, that he, Rowjee, should administer poison in the sheibet which the XLesident wfis in the habit of drinking every morning after his return from his walk, and that in accordance with this arrangement he, on the 9th November, administered the poison w r hich he had received from Nursoo Jemadar two or three days before. 20. Consequent on the confession made by Rowjee, which so seriously implicated Nursoo, Jemadar of peons, as an accessory in the a tempt to poison Colonel Phayre, I, with your permission, took Nursoo into custody on the 23rd, and gave him in charge of your Military guard at the Residency ; the following morning he was brought before me at his own request, and made an uncondi^ tional confession, but before hearing the details of the statement which he offered to make, I deemed it my duty to acquaint you in the first instance with the fact, that the Jemadar had confessed, and to urge that you would personally listen to what he had to say and satisfy yourself that his confession was volun tary and not being made under pressure or hope of pardon. 21. You then ordered Nursoo Jemadar to be brought before you and will remember that it was clearly and carefully explained to him before hearing his statement, that you would not only not hold out hope of pardon, but that he certainly would mt be pardoned, and that upon hearing this he took off his turban and laid it at your feet, remarking that he might be hanged or have his throat cut, but that he wished to unburden his mind and divulge all he knew and added, that he threw himself upon your mercy. He then made a detailed statement and was afterwards removed to the Military guard till the 26th on which day I took down his deposition vide Appendix lettered H. 22. It will be seen by a careful perusal and comparison of these two statements that though Rowjee and Nursoo were taken into custody on 64 Exd.—R. T. B.different dates, and kept quite separate one from the other, and therefore that no intercourse could possibly have taken place between them, yet their deposi tions corroborate each other on almost all material points in a manner that is remarkable; it is true that there are some minor incidental discrepancies, which, however, I would submit, rather add weight and conviction as to the truth of the statements, and remove any doubt that might be advanced of combination and conspiracy. 23. Further in corroboration of these confessions there are the statements marked I. and J. made by Jugga and Kabhai bin Amer Sing, who both state that they on various occasions accompanied Rowjee from the Camp to the Palace at night; that they usually went first to the house of Yeshwantrao, who with Salim used to accompany Uowjee to the Palace, and that Nursoo Jemadar also came sometimes. Jugga has further stated that he was present when llupees 500 were paid to Rowjee at Yeshwantrao's house by a Karkoon. 24. There is also further additional corroboration of Rowjee's and Nursoo's confessions in the statements appended and lettered M., N. and O., which go to prove that within the last year Rowjee had made up jewellery of the value of upwards of Rupees 500, though his salary has only been Rupees 10 per mensem. 25. In the confession made by Rowjee Havildar, Appendix G., he has also stated that he was*m the habit of writing or causing to be written by Jugga, a daily report of all that used to transpire at the Residency, and that these reports were usually taken home by the Jemadar at night and sent on to the Maharaja through Salim. On Salim's house being searched on the 24th December the papers found in his house were sealed and brought here for examination, and amongst them three such reports marked Nos. 5, 6, and 7 were discovered, one of which marked No. 5 has been found to be in the handwriting of Jugga as admitted in the further statements of Jugga and Rowjee, respectively, lettered P. and Q. The house of Salim was searched by the Gaekwar's Police in the presence of a Havildar of the Bombay Police, and the packet of letters delivered to the latter sealed. The seal was broken, and the packet opened by your Native Assistant as per their statements ap pended and lettered R. and S. 26. On the 25th December just before resuming Rowjee Havildar's examination the detective officers happened to enquire of him where he was in the habit of keeping the poison powders. After a little consideration he replied that he used to put them in a secret pocket attached to the end of his official cross belt, and on being asked where the belt was, he said it had been made over to a peon named Boodur Nursee. who was at once called, and on his stating that the belt he was then wearing was the same which belonged to Rowjee, it was taken from him, and on a very careful examination of the pocket a piece of paper was observed, this was with difficulty extracted from the reverse end by cutting the stitches which kept the pocket together, a small white powder was then taken from it, which Rowjee at once recognized and acknowledged as being a portion of one of those first given to him by Nursoo Jemadar to be administered to Colonel Phayre. I at once took down Rowjee's statement to this effect, docketed and sealed up the powder in a cover, and on my proceeding to Bombay on the 29th December, I lost no time in forward ing it to the Chemical Analyser to Government for examination, and beg now to attach his official report lettered T in the Appendix, from which it will be seen that the powder consisted of seven grains of white arsenic. Prom the manner in which this powder was discovered I have no doubt whatever that it was one ot those referred to in Rowjee Havildar's confession, and received by him from the Gaekwar through Salim and Nursoo and intended for the purpose of poisoning Colonel Phayre. 27. The name of Pedro De Souza, Butler to Colonel Phayre, having been referred to in the confession of Rowjee Havildar as one of the servants who used to visit the Gaekwar from the Residency, and who had been asked bv the 65 17Maharaja to administer poison to his master, I had him brought before me on my late visit to Bombay, and beg to attach his deposition, Appendix U, which I since caused to be taken down. It will be seen that he denies having ever visited the Gaekwar, but admits that he asked for and received Rupees 60 from him through Salirn, and states that he was pressed to visit the Maharaja by Salim, who offered to bring a carriage to take him to the Palace, but that he refused to go. 28. As there is no reason whatever to doubt Rowjee's evidence so much of which has already been proved to be quite accurate, and as he has no apparent motive for falselv accusing the Butler Pedro, I am, considerinsr all the circum- stances, fully convinced that the butler did visit the Gaekwar, and that the account of what took place at the Palace as related by Rowjee is correct. It could not, however, be reasonably expected that a servant would readily admit that he had on the offer of a large bribe shamelessly consented to betray his duty and murder a master whom he had served for 25 years. 29. I have endeavoured in this report to supply a brief narative of the steps taken by the Detective Police from the beginning, and to show how the enquiry progressed step by step each day, and have left the depositions and other appendices to supply all minor details. There is however an important piece of evidence which does not appear from those papers which I here submit. 30. Rowjee Havildar has stated in his deposition that after the first occasion when he consented to administer poison to Colonel Phayre, and received the powders for that purpose, he two or three times put them into the sherbet as opportunity offered, and that this was done a few days before the final powder was administered. 31. Colonel Phayre in his report to Government, No. 379-12/1, dated 17th November 1874, stated that on Friday, the 6th, and Saturday, the 7th, he was feeling sick at stomach with a strange confused feeling in his head, but that he was better on Sunday, and on Monday he discovered the poison in the sherbet. 1 consider this tact as strongly corroborative of Rowjee's statement, for I may add that the Residency Surgeon has stated that the symptoms reported by Colonel Phayre are such as are known to result from taking arsenic. 32. That the Gaekwar during his visit to the Resident on the morning on Monday, the 9th, should have talked of sickness prevailing in the city, and that he himself had lately been suffering from fever accompanied by purging and dizziness in the head, was a very significant circumstance. 38. Before closing my report I beg leave to call attention to the following circumstances as bearing upon the subject of by enquiry :— In August 1873, viz., before the sitting of the Baroda Commission, Police Inspector Rao Bahadoor Gujjanand Wittul Shastree was deputed to make secret enquiry into the truth of reports which had reached Government of a seditious movement in some of the Native States. That officer, under date 19th August 1873, made a report to his official superior, the Superintendent of Police, Ahmedabad, which is herewith sent on ♦ Lettered v. original,* in which it will be observed that the . . desire of His Highness Mulhar Rao to employ poison against the Resident is mentioned and Yeshwunt Rao Yeola is reported to be a likely man to be employed on such business, and it is reported that 'jadoo' and 'anoostan' sorcery and magic are at that time, August 1873, beino- used through Yeshwunt Rao against Colonel Phayre. n i 34 i' ^ ometi ^ e previously to the discovery of the attempt to poison ttv i i 16 beei1 re P orted to me b y my chief detective officers, Khan Bahadoor Meer Akbar Ali and Khan Bahadoor Meer Abdool Ali, that t oi s weie 3(!ing made in Bombay by the Gaekwar's confidential agents to secure PhnvTTi a Skll l ed SOrcerer with the ob j ect of g ettin g 'd ^ Colonel fnrnLL^fi f- S ' i re P or ted this fact to the Government of Bombay, and TT.nmVnfr i + U Particulars as brought to my notice, which were, I believe, com municated to the Government of India 6667 3o. I have already referred to the many and serious difficulties which my detective officers have had to contend with in their efforts to obtain evidence, but for the presence of the Gaekwar in Baroda their work would, I need hardly say, have been greatly simplified and even more direct proof would doubtless ha\ e been forthcoming.^ Still considering the manner in which all the evidence has been gathered from independent sources, the impossibility, owing to strictest precaution of any collusion, the demeanour of the deponents under examination, and the numerous minor incidents which accumulate corroboration round their testimony, I may with confidence assert, speaking after 20 years' experience of Ponce duty, that no doubt whatever is left in my mind that His Highness Mulhar Kao Gaekwar himself personally instigated the criminal attempt against Colonel Phayre's life. ^ o i &amp; 36. Under your orders I submitted the depositions and notes of evidence to the Advocate-General on the 30th December, and have the honor to append his opinion in original (lettered W) after review of them, and I trust that the duty which you committed to me may now be considered to have been accom plished as satisfactorily as could possibly have been hoped for under the circumstances. 37. In forwarding a copy of this report to the Government of Bombay, it shall be my duty to bring prominently to their notice the obligation which I am under to the Police Inspectors, Khan Bahadoor Meer Akbar Ali, Rao Bahadoor Gujjanand Vittul Shastree and Khan Bahadoor Meer Abdool Ali, for the valuable assistance which their zeal and ability has rendered me in the conduct of this important enquiry, and which I trust may obtain suitable recognition. 38. Requesting permission to return to my duty in Bombay. Appendix A. Shaik Dawood Shaik Raheem , Mussulman, age 22, living in the Camp Bazaar, Baroda, states:— I am a bullock shigram driver in the service of one Chotoo Baker. I know the Mussulman ayah now in the service of the Assistant Resi dent, Mr. Boevey, and who formerly lived at the Residency. I also know a Mussulman boy in the service of the ayah named Chotoo. I am also acquainted with the ayah's husband, Abdoola. A few days before the Dewalee, the ayah's husband came to my stables at night and ordered my shigram, which I got ready, and under his direction stood it on the road about 15 paces on the city side of Dadabhoy's shop-, where the ayah with the boy Chotoo very soon arrived. They both got in the shigram, and the ayah directed me to drive to the Sircar's Hawalee* in the city. On arrival at the Arab Khana (Arab's # , guard), the ayah told me to call Salim, an Arab sowar, which I did, and she then got out of the shigram and accompanied him up the stairs. I understood she was going to see the Maharaja. The boy Chotoo remained with me, and he and I went to sleep on the carriage cushions, which I placed on the side of the road close to the carriage. In about an hour Salim and the ayah returned to the carriage, into which she and the boy got, and I drove them back to the place from where they had first got into the carriage at the Camp Bazaar. The ayah and the boy went away towards the Residency, and in the morning the ayah's husband came and paid me Rupees 2 on account of my fare. Taken before me this 17th day of December 1874. (Sd.) F. H. S outer, Commissioner of Police, Bombay.Appendix B. Chotoo bin Shaik Boodhoo , Mussulman, age 14, inhabitant of Camp Baroda, in the service of Mr. Boevey's ayah, and formerly living in the Residency compound, states:— A few days before the Dewalee festival I accompanied the ayah one night to the bazar, where her husband was waitiug with a bullock shigram, into which we got, and drove to the Maharaja's Hawalee* in the city, where we were met by one Salim, an Arab servant of His Highness the Gaekwar. We got out of the shigram at the ' Hawalee,' and the ayah and Sarlim went upstairs to meet the Gaekwar. The driver and I went to sleep. After some time the ayah and Sarlim return ed and woke us up, and I and the ayah drove back and got out of the shigram at the Camp Bazar, where we had first taken it, and we walked home. I know Salim very well: he used often to come and drink water and smoke at the ayah's house when she lived in the Residency compound. Taken before me this 17th day of December 1874. P. H. S OUTER, Commissioner of Police, Homhay. Appendix C. Ameena , wife of Sheik Abdoolla Kiral , age about 40, and ayah to Mrs. Roevey, states :— At the time of the meeting of the Baroda Commission I was persuaded much against my will by Faizoo liamzan. Residency Chobdar, to visit the Maharaja Gaekwar. I went to see him three times altogether. On the first occasion I was taken to the Maharaja by Faizoo, and that was when the Inquiry Commission was sitting. Sowar Salim met us at the ' Hawalee,' and we all three proceeded before the Maharaja together. We went up three flights of stairs to where the Maharaja was sitting. He sp o ke to me personally, and begged of me to intercede with my madam, Mrs Phayre, in order that she might use her influence with the Resident in his the Maharaja's behalf. I made no promises. After being about half an hour with the Maharaja I left. Paizoo went to his house in the city, Salim remained at the palace, and I came home by myself in a bullock shigram. I visited the Maharaja twice again : the second time was after my return from Bombay and Nowsaree, when, on Mrs. Phayre's departure for England, I accepted service with her daughter, Mrs. Boevey, wife of the Assistant Resident. It must have been about a month after my return to Baroda that I visited the Maharaja on the second occasion. I was then persuaded by the Maharaja's Arab servant, Salim, to go to the Gaekwar, and I was taken by the Residency Naik, named Kurreem. The Maharaja and Salim talked to me about 'jadoo' (sorcery), but I remarked that Europeans could not be affected or influenced by such means. My interview with the Gaekwar lasted about half an hour, and I then returned home in the shigram with Kurreem. On this day I received no money, but two or three days after Kurreem Naik called at my house and gave me Rupees 100, statipg that Yeshwantrow Yeola had given Rupees 200, of which Rupees 100 was for him, which he had kept, and the other Rupees 100 for me. The third time I visited the Maharaja was during the Ramzan. I was then pressed to go by Salim, who fixed the day and time, and I went in company with my servant boy, named Chootoo. My husband, Abdoola, procured a shigram, and Salim met me at the Hawalee and took me before the Raja. On this occasion the Maharaja spoke to me with reference to the birth of Luxmee Bhai's child, and inquired whether the sahib and madam had been 68 Exd.—J.M.talking about him, the child, and if any objection was likely to be raised with regard to his legitimacy. The Maharaja asked me to do what I could in the matter ; but I told him that I could not help him. I was with the Maharaja for about half an hour on this occasion, and returned to my home at the Presidency with my servant boy about 10 o'clock at night. About two or three days after this visit Salim came to my house at the Hesidency and gave me Ilupees 50. I am quite familiar with the Maharaja Gaekwar's appearance, as I have often seen him during his visit to the Resident, and on one occasion when the Gaekwar's family came to visit Mrs. Phayre, the Maharaja was in the room when I happened to be called in and made my salaam. He was then sitting quite close, and I saw him distinctly, and it w^as the same person before whom I was taken and conversed with during each of my three visits to the Hawalee. The Kazee of Chandore, who was in the habit of frequenting the Resi dency, particularly when the llevd. Mr. Taylor used to be on a visit, in formed me about a month before the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre that the Resident's butler, Pedroo, and Rowjee, havildar of peons, were in great favor with the Maharaja, and that they had agreed to administer poison, but they did not say to whom. Kurreem Naik also told me about a month before the attempt to poison the Resident, that he had heard from a person in high position that Pedroo, butler, and Rowjee, havildar, had consented to administer poison. Taken before me this day, 18th December 1874. (Sd.) F. H. S outer, Commissioner of Police, Bombay. Amebna , wife of Shaik Abdoolla and ayali to Mrs. Boevey, is re-called at her own request, and further states :— W hen I gave my statement on the 18th, I was suffering from fever and was not feeling well, and omitted to mention certain facts which I have now remembered and wish to have recorded along with my first deposition. On the occasion of my being taken before the Maharaja the third time during the Ramzan, the Maharaja asked me, after other questions, whether it would not be possible to administer something by which the Resident could be brought round to his, the Maharaja's, will. The Gaekwar spoke in cautious and hidden language, but I understood him to be throwing out a feeler to ascertain whether I would consent to administer poison to my master. Colonel Phayre. I indignantly refused, and objected, and told the Maharaja that if he attempted anything of the sort, he would get into serious trouble and , • ukmnrnaUHnhikapatn.. be ruined. I exclaimed—' It would* be better that w alla nai inunia.—This is a very lakllS of people should die than that the Supporter common Oriental idiomatic phrase. of should come by his ^ was standing close to the Maharaja at this time, endeavoured to persuade me by kind words and by saying that if I would only do as the Maharaja wished, I would have provision made for me for the rest of my life, and that my husband should also be taken into service under the Raja.

Shaik Abdoola bin Shaik Adum , Mussulman, age 35 years, profession butler, states A meena is the name of my wife. I married her by nika about 10 years a?o. She took service with Mrs. Phayre as ayah about 15 months back, and remained so employed till Mrs. Phayre's departure for England. My wife accompanied Mrs. Phayre to Bombay, and after her departure remained there for about a month. Siie lived in Khetwarree, where she w^as detained by sickness. After a month my wife returned from Bombay and came to Nowsarree, where she joined Mrs. Boevey, wife of the Assistant Resident, with whom she took service. In the month of May or June my wife returned to Baroda with Mrs. Boevey and lived at the Residency. I came to Baroda about ten days later, having been wdth my master. Major Blakeny, to Mahableshwur. I am aware that my wife visited the Maharaja Gaekwar on those occasions. The first time she went was during the month that the Commission was sitting at Baroda, and then she was persuaded and taken •by Fizoo Ramzan, Chobdar of the Residency. My wife went at night, and the following morning she told me that she bad had an interview with the Maharaja, and that she had promised to intercede on his behalf through the madam (Mrs. Phayre) and get what he wanted done. The second time that my wife visited the Gaekwar was after her return from Now sarree, and then she was accompanied by Kurreem, Naik of the Residency peons. The third time that my wife went to the Maharaja was during the last Ramzan. He ordered a bullock shigram for her, and she started in company with her servant boy Chotoo about 9 o'clock at night. My wife told me the following morning that she had had an int- rview with the Maharaja, and that during the conversation she had begged of him on no account to poison Colonel Phayre, the Resident. Rupees 200 were given to Kurreem Naik after my wife's second visit, of which he paid her 100, and kept the other 100 himself. She also received Rs. 50 from the Arab Sowar, Salim. Yeshwantrao Yeala pro mised to obtain service for me under the Maharaja on completion of his garden palace called Nuzzer Bagh, to look after the glassware and to attend upon European gentlemen on occasions of their visiting there. The two letters produced and shown me in the Marathee character, marked Nos. 8 and 4, were written and addressed by me to my wife, they were both despatched from Baroda; the other tw T o letters, numbered 1 and 2, were addressed to me by my wife from Bombay.

Shaikh Kureeem bin Shaik Misree, Mussulman, age 40, Naik of Peons on the establishment of the Assistant Resident, states :— L ast hot weather I accompanied the Assistant Resident to Nowsarree. A lew days after his return to Baroda the ayah, Ameena, lately in the service of the Assistant Resident, accompanied me to see the Maharaja; we took a bullock shigram at the school, and started about 8 o'clock at night; we first went to the 70house of Salim Sowar, who got into the shigram and took us to the ITawalee, and we all three were conducted by a private entrance to the presence of the Maharaja, m I io was upstairs. r l he Maharaja, Salim, and the ayah talked pi natch together tor about an hour; there was no other person present. We returned to the Residency about 11 o'clock. Ihe lollowing day I went to Yeswantrao Veala by direction of the ayah. 1 found Salim there, and he gave me llupees 200, and told me that 100 was for myself and 100 for the ayah. Yestwantrao was present at the time I reeehed the money. I returned to the Residency and gave the 100 rupees to the ayah in the presence of her husband.

K arbhie P oon/abhie , Mussulman, age 25, hack shigram driver in the service of one Ram- chunder llulwiee, residing in the Cantonment Bazar of Baroda, states:— A boiit a year ago a man engaged my master's shigram to go into the town. He came just about 6 o'clock in the afternoon and gave the order, and then about half past 7 he returned and ordered the shigram which was got ready and taken near to the school, where I stood the conveyance till the man went to the Residency and brought a woman, who I afterwards ascertained to be an ayah. They both got into the shigram and ordered me to drive to the city. When we got to the Champanaree Gate they both got out and ordered me to wait there till their return. They came back about 11 o'clock, and I drove them to the school again, where I was discharged, and they walked in the direction of the Residency : the man paid me Rupees 1-8 as my fare. The woman Ameena shown me sick in hospital just now is the ayah I took to the city on the occasion referred to, and the man pointed out and callino- himself Pizoo is the persoon who hired my master's bullock shigram, and who accompanied the ayah.

R owjeb bin R ama , Mahratta, age 24, Havfldar of Peons on the establishment of the Resi dency at Baroda, states :— A bout two months before the Commission sat at Baroda, Salim, Arab sowar, who was in the constant habit of visiting the Residency with His High ness the Gaekwar, spoke to me and said that the Maharaja wished to see me. 1 agreed, and it was decided that I should go on the following Sunday and meet him, Salim, at the house of Yeshwantrao about 8 o'clock at night. I was taken before the Maharaja by Salim and Yeshwantrao by a private entrance to the side of the Nuzzer Bagh. On being introduced to the Maharaja, he asked me if I would agree to ke-'p him informed of all that went on at the 71Residency. T consented, and he promised to reward me handsomely and to confer other favors upon me. The Maharaja asked me if I could get the Jemadar of Peons, Nursoo, to help in this matter also and to visit him. I promised that I would arrange this, as the Jemadar was a great friend of mine. I then left the Maharaja and the following day I spoke to the Jemadar and told him of the Maharaja's wishes. The Jemadar said that his family was ill, and that he had his duties to attend to, and could not go to the Maharaja at that time. I visited the Maharaja several times again previous to the sitting of the Com mission, and on each occasion I went first to Yeshwantrao's house and was invariably accompanied by him and by Salim when taken before the Gaekwar. I visited the Maharaja three times while the Commission was sitting, and fur nished him witli all the information I was able to gather as to the action of the Commission, and of all that was going on at the Residency. At one of these latter visits I informed the Maharaja that I was about to be married, and that I was without the necessary means. He ordered Yesh- wantrao to remind him of this, and the following Monday, when the Maharaja came on his usual visit to the Residency, Yeshwantrao, who accompanied him, informed me that he had got Rupees 500 for me and told me to come for it. I went soon after in company with one Jugga (a man employed at the Resi dency to pull the punka) to Yesluvantrao's house, where Rupees 500 were paid to me by a Karkoon in Yesliwantrao's presence and before Jugga. Of this money I lent Rupees 100 to Jugga, and made up a silver anklet of the value of about Rupees 100, and the rest was expended on my marriage. One Darjepbhie Kureea got the anklet made up for me. After my marriage and a few days after the Commission had left Baroda, Salim Sowar met me and said that he had got the Jemadar all right and will ing, and wished to know when I could come in company with him to see the Maharaja. I settled with him to go two days later, which was on a Sunday ; the Jemadar and I met that night at Yeshwantrao's house about 8 o'clock. Jugga accompanied me, as I did not like to go by the rear road to the city at night by myself. From Yeshwantrao's house we all went to the Hawalee, where Jugga remained below, and Salim, Yeshwantrao, the Jemadar, and I went up and interviewed the Maharaja; this was the Jemadar's first visit, and he consented, at the Maharaja's request, to keep him informed of all that transpired at the Residency, for which promise of favor a liberal reward was held out to the Jemadar by the Maharaja. It was then arranged that Salim should from time to time receive and convey information from the Jemadar to the Maharaja. I accompanied the Jemadar two or three times on his visits to the Maharaja previous to the Resident's leaving for Nowsaree. At Nowsaree nothing parti cular transpired. Salim and Yeshwantrao accompanied the Maharaja, but lived in the compound of the house occupied by the Resident; there they struck up a friendship with the Resident's butler, Pedroo, and about two or three days after the return of Colonel Phayre to Baroda, the butler, Pedroo, asked me if I would accompany him to the Maharaja. 1 agreed, and on an appointed day Salim came to the Residency, and we three went off together about 10 o'clock at night in a bullock shigram, which had been placed on the road by Salim and belonging to the Durbar. We went direct to the Hawalee where we met Yeshwantrao, who took us up to the Maharaja. The Gaekwar spoke to Pedroo and asked him if he understood English. He said he did a little, so the Maharaja requested him to communicate to him any conversation that might take place at the table relating to him, to which Pedroo consented. I accompanied the butler, Pedroo, on two other occasions to the Maharaja pre vious to his going to Goa after the rains. We went to the Hawalee in the same manner as before and with Salim and Yeshwantrao: nothing particular transpired. On the butler's return from Goa I accompanied him again to see the Maharaja. Salim came as before and brought a shigram which we met on the road. Yeshwantrao met us as usual at the Hawalee, and we were taken 72before the Maharaja, who first enquired of Pedroo how he was and when he returned, and then said he had something of importance for him to do and asked if he would do it. Pedroo said if it was a matter within his province that he would do it. Yeshwantrao then handed a small paper packet to the Maharaja, who passed it on to Pedroo, and told him to administer it in his master's food. Pedroo remarked that if anything should happen suddenly, he would get into trouble. The Maharaja said that he was not to fear, as nothing would take place for near three months, when his master would either die or get mad. Pedroo consented to do what was wanted, and we returned to the llesi- dency about midnight. In addition to the visits I paid the Maharaja at night in company with Pedroo, I also went to see him several times in company with the Jemadar after our return from Nowsaree. The Jemadar was not aware of my having gone to the Maharaja with Pedroo. About 15 or 20 days after our return from Kowsaree the Jemadar gave me at his house in the city Rupees 300, which he said was half the sum he had received f»'oni the Durbar to be divided between us. About three weeks or a month before the attempt to poison the Resident was discovered, the Jemadar and I were taken before the Maharaja by appoint ment at night. Yeshwantrao and Salim introduced us, the Maharaja sat in his private room as before, and after a short conversation he remarked that the Resident was very hard upon him and doing great ' zoolum,' and asked us if we would consent to administer something which he would give. Salim and Yeshwantrao immediately began to persuade us by saying that if we would only carry out the Maharaja's wishes, we should not be required to serve any longer, as he would make a handsome life provision for us and our families ; that we should have ' assamies' bestowed upon us, and should in addition receive a lakh of rupees cash as soon as the work was done, meaning as soon as the Resi dent's death took place. We consented to do the job, and the Maharaja then said that the article to be administered would be given to us by Yeshwantrao and Salini. A few days after this the Jemadar gave me two powders, and told me that equal parts of each should be administered for two or three days, and in such quantity as to consume the whole in that time. This had also been care fully explained to me by Yeshwantrao and Salim in the presence of the Maha raja. I did not commence to administer the powders for two or three days, as no favorable opportunity presented itself for so doing. It was decided at our con sultation with the Maharaja that the poison should be administered in ' sherbut' which Colonel Phayre was in the habit of taking every morning on return from his walk. Accordingly I put the powders into the ' sherbut' two or three times whenever I found no person in the room or about to see me. As a few days elapsed without anything happening, the Maharaja evi dently became impatient, and sent for me and the Jemadar again. We went in the usual manner with Yeshwantrao and Salim. The Maharaja remon strated with ns for not having done the work we promised. I assured him that I had put the powder into the sherbut two or three times, and I expressed my doubts as to the poison being efficacious; thereupon the Maharaja said he would give another powder, which Salim produced and handed to the Jemad: The Maharaja said that this would not take immediate effect, but that it would work slowly and surely. We then left, and the following morning the Jemadar gave me the packet of poisoii at the Residency while I was sitting on the form close to the screen and near to where Colonel Phayre used to sleep. A day or two after this I administered the poison in the glass of sherbut which had just been made and placed it on the wash-hand table close to the Resident's writing desk in his private office room. Colonel Phayre was out walking at the time, and returned about 20 minutes after. I informed the Jemadar when he came about half past 7 o'clock of what I had done. When I visited the Maharaja the punkawalla Jugga accompanied me from the Camp Bazar sometimes, but a man named Karbhie more frequently came with me as far as the Hawalee. They never appeared before the Maharaja, and I only took them as company, as 1 was afraid to go so far at night by myself. 73 19The packet of poison which the Jemadar first gave mo I made into small flosps ns directed and kept the powders in the secret pocket of my cross-belt. The powder taken from the secret pocket of my cross-belt this morning (25th December 1874) is one of the powders made up from the packet given to me by the Jemadar, and I used always to keep the powders m the same place. W hile at Nowsarree I spoke to Yeshwantrao and Sahmatthe Jemadars request to get some money for him, and they interceded with the Maharaja, who ordered Us 250 to be given to the Jemadar through Salim, who, at the Jemadars request, paid the money to one ol his brothers at Baroda. Whenever there was any information to send to the Maharaja Irom the Ilesidency, and I was unable to go to the Hawalee myself, I used to write or o-et Ju^a to write at my dictation, and the note used to be taken by the Jema dar when he went home at night to the city, and he used to send it on to the Maharaia through Salim. The gold and silver ornaments which I have pro duced, and valued at about Es. 420, have been made up from the money which I have from time to time received Irom the Maharaja. Taken before me on the 24th and 25th December 1874. (Sd.) E. H. S outer, Commissioner of Police. Howjee bin Rama is re-called and further states:— O n the occasion when the Jemadar and I were taken before the Maharaja in company with Yeshwantrao and Salim, and it was decided and anangtd tluit poison should be administered to Colonel Phayre, it was carefully explained to me and I was instructed each time to mix the powder in water first, otherwise I w T as told that the poison would float on the surface of the sherbut. Accord ingly I used to shake the powder up w T ith water in a small phial and pour it into the glass of sherbut. The Jemadar knew this, and w T as aware that 1 kept the phial for this purpose concealed under a large empty box which stood close to the form on which the peons sat while on duty. Taken before me this day the 26th of December 1874. (Sd.) P. H. SOTJTEll, Commissioner of Police, Bombay. E ltwjee H avildar was taken into custody by the Police on the 22nd De cember, and on the same evening, on promise of conditional pardon that he should tell the whole trutn, he confessed to having been the person who admi nistered the poison to Colonel Phayre. The following morning he was brought before Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly, who repeated and confirmed the promise oi pardon conditionally offered, upon which Rowjee then made the detailed state ment taken down on the 25th and 26th idem. (Sd.) F. II. S outer, Commissioner of Police, Bombay. H. Nursoo bin Barjana , Kamatee, age 50, Jemadar of Peons on the establishment of the Re?i- dent of Baroda, states :— A bout the time of the sitting of the Commission at Baroda Rowjee llavil- dar told me one day that he had been speaking favorably of me to the Maha- 74raja, who had expressed a wish to see me. I replied that there was sickness in my house and that I had my duties to attend to, and therefore could not arrange to go to the Maharaja at that time. After the Commission left Baroda, Yeshwantrao, Salim, and Rowjee all urged tne to go and see the Maharaja, and I at last consented. On a fixed day I went to the house of Yeshwantrao, where Rovvjee and Salim also met me, and we went together by way of the Xuzzer Bagh and a private entrance to an upstair private room into which Yeshwantrao brought the Maharaja and intro duced me. The Maharaja first remarked that I was a scamp and a bad man and had never been favorable to, or assisted him, but the three men, Yesh- wantrao, Salim, and Rowjee, assured the Maharaja that they had all spoken to me, and that I was now fully prepared to carry out his orders and act up to his wishes. The Maharaja then requested me to keep him regularly informed through Salim of all that transpired at the Residency, to which I consented. On this occasion a man named Karhhie accompanied Rowjee from the camp to the palace, but he did not appear before the Maharaja. About 20 or 25 days later I again visited the Maharaja in company with the same people and in the same manner. Nothing particular transpired at this visit beyond furnishing the Maharaja with all the information we had regarding matters at the Resi dency. In the month of April I accompanied the Resident to Nowsaree; the Maharaja also came there and lived in his Hawalee, while Colonel Phayre was located in a bungalow close to the Railway station, and about a mile from the Maharaja's Hawalee. Salim and Yeshwantrao lived in the Resident's com pound. I believe Rowjee used to visit the Maharaja at Nowsaree, and through Salim he obtained for me a present of Rupees 25 (3, which at my request was paid to one of my brothers at Baroda. About a month or more after the Resident's and Maharaja's return from Nowsaree I visited the Gaekwar again in company with Rowjee, Salim, and Yeshwantrao. We met as usual at the house of the latter, who took us before the Maharaja. We first gave him all the information of what had been going on at the Residency, and then Salim and Yeshwantrao remarked to the Maha raja that we (Rowjee and I) had not received anything on account of his recent marriage with Luxmee Bai. He said very well that he would see about it. We then left and a few days after Salim brought me Rupees 800, of which I gave him Rupees 100, and I believe I paid 490 to Rowjee, from which sum he was to pay Jugga Rupees 100. About two months later I again visited the Maharaja in company with Rowjee We met as before at the house of Yeshwantrao, and he and Salim took us'before the Maharaja. We first informed the Maharaja of all that had been coing on at the Resideney, after which ho remarked that Colenel Phayre was very bard and doing great zoolum to him, and asked if \\c could and would consent to put something in his food. I replied that m my position I have no opportunity to do this, upon which Yeshwantrao and Sahm began o nersuadc us by saving that if we only consent to do this job the Maharaja would reward us in such a manner that we should not be required to serve any longer, and that our families should also be handsomely provided for, and that the remainder of our lives would he spent in ease and comfort. Rowjee then sa.d *V •' r ersres^ss: Yeshwantrao ' AVc left, and the following day Salim the powder was within the upper folds of my ,urban, She noxunorning I gave the packet to Rowjee while he was sitting on the 75form close to the screeu near where Colonel Phayre used to sleep. T did not open the packet, and therefore was unaware of the number of powders it- contained. A few days after this when Yeshwantrao and Salim came to the Residency with the Maharaja, they began to enquire of llowjee how it was that nothing had happened, and asked whether he had administered the powders or not. llowjee then spoke to me and said he did not know how to account for there being no result, as he had certainly put the poison in the ' sherbut.' The Maha raja being dissatisfied about this sent for us again, and about fifteen days after the great Dussara Sawaree we went as usual to Yeshwantrao's house. It was about 8 o'clock at night when llowjee and I met there, and we accompanied Yeshwantrao and Salim as before, and they brought the Maharaja and introduced us in the same room. He immediately upbraided us for not having carried out his wishes as promised, upon which llowjee declared that he had put the powders in the ' sherbut,' but stated that he did not think they could possibly have possessed the required property. The Maharaja then said very well, that he would give something else which would be brought to me by Salim. At this time and when we were about to leave, Yeshwantiao gave something (I am not sure what it was, a small bottle or what it was) to Salim, who passed it on to Rowjee. The former promises of high reward and favor were repeated, and we came away. The following morning Salim brought me a packet which I handed to Rowjee the same day on coming to the Residency, lie was sitting as before on the form near the screen. A few davs after this the conversation took place of the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre. Rowjee told me that as instructed he on each occasion mixed the powder with water which he shook up in a little bottle before pouring it into the sherbut. He used to keep the bottle for this purpose hid under a large empty wooden box close to the form above referred to. Rowjee used often to give me notes, written sometimes by himself and sometimes by Jugga at his dictation, to send on to the Maharaja. These notes contained all the information of what was going on at the Residency, and Salini or his man used to call at my house for them. I live in the city, and have always been in the habit of returning to my house at night, and on Sundays I have not been inquired to come to the Residency. On the several occasion? when we visited the Maharaja, Jugga came once with Rowjee from camp and on all other occasions he was accompanied by Karbhie. Taken this 26th day of December 1874 before (Sd.) P. H. S outer, Commissioner oj Police, Bombay. Nursoo Jemadar was taken into custody on the 23rd December consequent on the confession made by Rowjee, which so seriously implicated him as an accessory in t ie attempt to poison Colonel Phayre. He was at once given in charge oi the military guard at the Residency. The following morning, at his own expressed wish, he was brought to the Commissioner of Police, before whom he made an unconditional confession. Previous however to hearing his statement, it was distinctly explained that no promise of pardon could be held out to him. Ihe Jemadar was then brought before Sir Lewis Pelly, who told him before listening to his confession that he would not only not hold out hope of pardon, but explained to him distinctly and positively that he would not be pardoned. I pon this the Jemadar took off his turban and laid it at the feet 76 Exd.—J. T. F.If 1 : Lo ^ ls -Pelly, saying that he might be hanged or have his throat cut, hut that he wished to unburden his mind and tell the truth, and that he threw him self upon his, Sir Lewis Felly's mercy. , n heai : in § tlie Jemadar's detailed statement made without reserve before Sir Lewis Pelly and the Commissioner of Police, he was again given n c large of the military guard till the 26th, on which day he was re-called and is coiuession taken down at length by the Commissioner of Police. Afte . r t ! 1 . e Prisoner 's statement had been recorded, he asked to be permitted o a vo us dinner in the back garden of the llesidency situated within 100 yards from the bungalow. He partook of his food close to a well, near to ™ nc i he had been taken for the convenience of water, and he had scarce! v tmished when he suddenly rushed away from the Police Guard and threw him- 1 7 0 the 4 wel1 - A policeman immediately jumped in and rescued him; this was about 4 p.m ., and he was at once taken before Sir Lewis Pelly, who ques tioned him as to the reason for what he had done, and enquired whether he had ecu in any way ill-used or ill-treated by any body. This he positivelv denied, and declared that the reason for what he had done was that, as he had served government for 35 years, he was now, after what had taken place, ashamed to siow his lace, that 1 us mind was confused and troubled, and therefore he had thrown himself into the well. The following morning (27th December) Sir Lewis Pelly personally visited . uisoo Jemadar in the guard-room and made similar enquiries of him a^ain with regard to his throwing himself into the well, but the same reply was given as on the previous evening, and this statement was made in the presence ot one of the Jemadars brothers, who had come from the city to enquire after Taken before me this 29th day of December 1874. (Sd.) F. H. S outer, Commissioner of Police, Bombay. Appendix I. J ugoa B hagwan, age 30, Kolee, resident of Camp Baroda, states; F or eight months of the year I am employed to pull punkah at the Resi dency, and therefore I am acquainted with Nursoo Jemadar and Howjee, Havildar of Peons, and also with Yeshwantrao and Salim in the service of the Maharaja. About a year ago I accompanied Rowjee Havildar from the Camp to Yeshwantrao's house in the city; it was about 8 o'clock at night. I did not see Yeshwantrao, but his Karkoon was there, and he and Rowjee went inside the house, and after a little while they came to the door when the Karkoon counted out Rupees 500 to Rowjee, and we brought the amount to my house when Rowjee counted out Rupees 100 from the bag which he left with me, and the remaining Rupees 400 he carried home. I accompanied Rowjee Havildar once again to Yeshwantrao's house; it was after the Resident and the Maharaja returned from Nowsaree. Nursoo Jemadar, Salim, and Yeshwantrao all met there, and together with Rowjee they went to the Hawalee. I accompanied them, and remained below while they went up to visit the Mahara.a. Thev came down after an hour, and then I returned to Camp with Rowjee. While employed at the Residency I used frequently to take down notes at Rowjee's dictation ; these notes usually contained information of what was '-oinn- on at the Residency, and were written in the Goozaratee languan-e and o-iven to Rowjee Havildar. 77 Taken before me this 29th day of December 1874. (Sd.) F. H. S outer, Commissioner of Police, Bombay, 20Appendix J. Kaubhie bin Amersing , Baria, af?e about 32, inhabitant of Sowarsee, residing in Camp Baroda, states:— I was employed for a sliort time at the Eesideney as a punka coolie about two months a^o, and therefore I am acquainted with the Jemadar Nursoo and Havildar of Peons named Rowjee; the latter sometimes employs me to do jobs for him, and several times I accompanied him at night into the city. He used invariably to go first to the house of a person whose name I don't know, but who always wears a large turban, and from there Ivowjee, the man with the large turban and a Mussulman with a beard, use to go together to the Ilawalee. The Jemadar Nursoo used to meet and accompany them. I sometimes used to go as far as the Ilawalee, where I waited below and the others went upstairs, andTw T ere absent usually for an hour or so. I have been shown two persons (Yeshwantrao and Salim) now confined in the military guard of the Ilesidency, and they are the same men who always accompanied the Jemadar and E&gt;owjee Havildar to the Plawalee.

Faizoo Rumzan , Mahomedan, age 45, Chobdar on the establishment of the Resident of Baroda, states:— A bout the time that the Commission was sitting at Baroda, the Ayah Ameena, servant to Mrs. Phayre, asked me to accompany her to see the Maharaja. We both left the Residency about 10 o'clock at night, and got into a bullock shigram that was waiting for us near the school; the shigram was driven by the man now pointed out to me named Karbhie Poonjabhie. We drove to the Charpanaree Gate of the city; there we were met by Salim, the Maharaja's Arab sowar, and we got out of the shigram and went on together to the ' Hawalee' leaving the shigram at the gate, which is about 150 yards from the Palace. We were taken by a private entrance and by way up the Nuzzer iiagh up several stairs to a private room when Salim left us and then brought the Maharaja; the Maharaja enquired of the ayah why she did not come to see him. She replied that she had a good deal of work and could not find time. The Maharaja requested her to come occnsionally, and to speak to the madam and ask to say a few words in his favor to the Resident. I also spoke to the Maharaja regarding my son, w 7 ho is in his service as a sowar, and told him that his present pay was not sufficient. We then came away and returned to the Residency about midnight. This was the only occasion on which I visited the Maharaja. Taken before me this 29th day of December 1874. (Sd.) E. H.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt from the hands of Mr- Superintendent Brown of your letter No. A., dated 30th December 1874. Enclosed in this letter was a sealed envelope, the seal being unbroken. It was labelled 44 powder found in the pocket of Rowjee Havildar's cross belt on the 25th of December 1874,' and contained a small paper packet in which were grains seven of white powder. I have examined this white powder and find it to consist of common white arsenic. Appendix U. Pedro DeSouza, Native Christian, states:— I am about thirty-seven years of age, and have for more than twenty-five years past been in service of Colonel R. Phayre, the late Resident at Baroda. I have been serving that gentleman as his butler for the last fifteen or sixteen years, and before that I filled several situations of different kinds in his house hold. When Colonel Phayre w as appointed to the office of Resident at Baroda which was, I think, in the month of March 1873. I accompanied him to that place, lived in the Residency, and served him there from that time until the month of September last, when I obtained leave of absence from him and proceeded to Goa, my native country. I left Baroda on the 3rd October last, went to Goa, remained there about a fortnight, and returned to Baroda on the 3rd November, one month after my departure. I know one Salim, a Mahomedan, who resides at Baroda and is a Jassood in the service of His Highness the Gaekwar. I have known this man Salim from the time I first went to Baroda with Colonel Phayre as above stated. He used to come to the Residency twice a week regularly during all the time I stayed there. The Gaekwar always came twice a week—on Mondays and Thursdays—to pay a sort of official visit to the Resident, and on these days Salim always preceded His Highness to give notice of his coming. Saliin always brought w ith him on these occasions a tray of fruit as a sort of nuzzerana or tribute of respect. In the month of August last when I first thought of obtaining leave from my master to go to Goa I was short of money, and on seeing Salim at the Residency one day I said :— ' I am thinking of going to my native country for a month but am badly off for money, my wife is pregnant, and the expenses on her account and for travelling will be heavy; will you entreat the Maharaja to give me some money for this purpose ? Salim replied that he would speak to the Maharaja and bring me the money. No particular sum w r as named by either of us. 1 made this request to Salim, because I had heard that the servants of previous Residents had obtained similar favors from the hands of the Gaekwar. Salim himself had told me this many times before I made my said request to him. About a fortnight after I had so spoken to Salim, he came to me in my room at the Residency and said :—' The Maharaja has sent you these rupees. I told him what you said.' I thanked him very much, took the rupees he offered me, and he went away. I counted the rupees as he gave them to me, and said:—'Here are sixty rupees of Baroda Currency which are equal to fifty Bombay Rupees.' Two or three days after this, or on his next visit to the Residency, Salim met me in the compound of the Residency and said:—'You come and see the Maharaja. If you will agree to come I w r ill bring a carriage to take you.' On hearing this I said:—' I will never come to the Uamelee {i.e., Palace).' He replied:—'If you cannot come now I will bring a carriage for you whenever you wish to come.' To this I again said :— ' I will never come!' After my return to Baroda from Goa I never saw 81 * 21Salim except in passing, and I had no speech with him other than to say salaam! I positively declare that I never received any other gift liom the Gaekwar than this one of Rupees 60 sent to me through Salim, and that never had any conversation with Salim about my own affairs, or m connection with the Gaekwar excepting on the occasion mentioned. 1 never went to the Hatoelee or spoke to the Gaekwar, and I never had any correspondence with him either directly or indirectly other than that above detailed. Further i say not. Taken on oath, and duly acknowledged and signed by Pedro DcSouza in my presence this fifth day of January 1875. (Sd.) A. E dginton, J .C., Deputy Commr. of Police, Bombay. T ee foregoing statement was duly read and interpreted by me to the said Pedro DeSouza on the day and date above written and acknowledged by him to be correct. (Sd.) D inanath S oonderjee, P., Head Clerk, Commissioner of Police. Appendix V. Dated 19th August 1873. From —G ujanun V ithul (demi-official). To—Superintendent of Police, Ahmedabad. A fter your arrival from Poona you had given me orders for some enquiry. On making enquiry about the subject I have got up to this time the following information :— The information I have acquired before this has been communicated to Mr. Souter before long, and for which I had spoken to you in person. Letters addressed as A. B. are going to Moonshee Lootioola s son, who is a Registration Clerk in the Collector's Office here. It appears that they are coming from a teacher in the Baroda iiiUglish School, ihis information is obtained by making some skillful arrangement for which I had informed you in person. As regards the Baroda affairs the following information is acquired up to this time. There being disunion between His Highness Mulhar llao Gaekwar and the present Resident, Mulhar Rao was speaking that the Resident should be poisoned. He also told Dajee Sahib, a Superintendent of the Baroda ice factory, to do this. But they could not do it, and now it appears that they dare not do such act through fear. Yeshwanta Yawalya is a dearest Jasood of Mulhar Rao Maharaj. He appears to be such a man as to become privy to such bad acts. It appears from the enquiry that at present he is engaged in the Khalpat of Jadoo and Anoostan. It is found from the enquiry that the talk about the pregnancy ot Mulhar Rao's Ranee is false. In truth she is not pregnant. A man by name Vaman Rao, a relation or servant of Gunpat Rao Bapoo of Akola, had gone to Bombay and Calcutta some time ago, and brought mtorma- 8283 tion from thence regarding the acts of Government. Now Moroba Khande Rao, a karkoon of Khanwalkur, and a man by name llajaram Puntb, both have gone , ,,, „ , to Bombay to make some Khalput there; also it 1 o got nd of the Resident. .. • _ ., , A , j. seems that a few days ago they had gone to Bombay. These persons are bringing all information from Bombay. It has been • Names will be given by Gujanan heard that they liaVC got SOme S0C1 Ot ageiltb in when required. Bombay. Appendix W. Dated 30th December 1874. From —Hon'ble Andrew R. Scoble, (demi-official), To—F. Souter, Esq., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. I have gone through the depositions taken by you at Baroda, and in my opinion they make out a strong prima facie case of abetment of an attempt to murder against the Gaekwar Yeshwunt Bao and Salim. If the parties were ordinary Bombay inhabitants, I have no doubt a J ury would convict them on the evidence recorded. No. 1. Translation of a Marathi letter marked No. 1, from Amina Bi, aya, Bombay, to Hazarat Sheikh Abdoolla, Butler, residing at Baroda. I, A mina B i , aya, now residing at Bombay, represent as follows I sent to you a letter affixing a postage label on it. I do not know whether it has reached you or not, and I am therefore under arxiety day and night. I trust vou will therefore not act in this way, but will frequently communicate the news and thereby gratify me. If you wish that I should not go there, I am ready to undertake a voyage to England. If you wish, I shall endeavour to obtain a situation of that'kind. I am in doubt as to why no letter is received from you here. I await a reply from you. If you call me I shall go there, and it will not matter (in the least). 1 wrote to you for (money for my) ex penses, but nothing has been received from you. Convey my best compliments to the Kazi Saheb, my compliments to Salam, my best compliments also to Yeshwunt Rao. « Chotee's mother owes me Rupee 1, you should deduct it from her son's pav because she has not visited me since her arrival at Bombay. You should I,; ' t0 an d make proper enquiries at the place there, where I am coming to Take up service. I hear that he has obtained an appointment in Rewa Kanta. If such a thin'- has happened it is very bad. Write to say whether you have borrowed Rupees 5 from Vengurlekar Mahomed. He comes here and duns me for the (payment of the) same. Let me know whether tins is true. I do not know whether or not you have delivered the note (chitti) enclosed in mv last letter to the person for whom it was intended. I labor under anxiety on this account only. Give my best compliments to Nathiaba. Write to say whether or not you have received the two 'Firkis. What more need be written ? This is my request, dated 29tb March 187-1. I reside in the Shetwadi in the same house as before. No. 2. Translation of a Marathi letter, marked No. 2, from Amis* Br, aya residing at Bombay, to Hazarat Shbikh Abdooixa, bntler, at present residing at Mahableshwar. T he cause of writing (this letter) is as follows :-I have received your letter and understood its contents. I hope you will in like manner frequently communicate to me the news from that place through lettersand thereby gratify me. Salam saw me on his arrival here, but as that is a ' Raj Darbari' matter (State matter), it will be done leisurely as opportunities offer. I am a little better. I have sent a letter there stating that I would attend on the 20th, and it is my intention to go there accordingly. I have now also commenced taking medicine. Ihere is also less strength in my hands. Rupees 5 have been paid to Vazir Ma. You gave to me the letter received by you from home and then left. On reading it I found its contents as follows:—' The house of your father-in-law is about to be attached. What place should be then fixed for residence?' lean give no reply about this. Formerly I told her to reside in (our; house, but she did not mind this and lived there at her father's house. She has sent for Rupees 5 for expenses and a black sari.* Even when she has money in her • a piece of cloth worn by women. ^ ^ ^ j am therefore thrown into difficulties on all sides. Every one secures his or her own object, and at last I am likely to be disgraced. If a single pot, out of the pots, &amp;c., which are in the house is lost, you will be responsible for it. You write to say that you will send Rupees 10 for me. It will be well if you send the same soon, that is, before the 18th. If not, it is your pleasure. I have no force on you. Erom Ali Sha Jemadar have been received Rupees 25 on account of himself. Rupees 25 on account of Rahim Sab, and Rupees 10 on account of Sha Sab, in all Rupees 60. Rupees 40 remained (to be recovered) for which it is in contemplation to get a fresh bond executed. Rupees 20 due to a Marwari should be paid off soon. After the payment thereof I am to proceed thither. By (my) taking one month's leave, I have been subjected to a heavy loss. But what can be done ? Owing to my illness I could not help (doing so). I had been to Yeshwunt Rao's house. He has gone to Pandharpoor on 15 days' leave. He spoke to me as follows :—' On my return I shall have arrange ments made about you. The Maharaja twice or thrice enquired when the aya would come.' Salam was invited to my place of residence here. He was shown attention so far as my poor circumstances woul^ permit. Let this be known. What more need be written ? Rahim Sab t L) i 1 iwit . Dilhan,t Baba Matkar, and others send their best compliments to you. Dated XQth April 1874. No. 3.

I am well by the favor of God and by your blessings. The cause of writing (this) letter is as follows:— I have had no tidings of you since your departure from Baroda. This has made me very uneasy. You should, therefore, not act in this way. But it's the will of God, and there is no fault chargeable to you. It is my fate. What can you do ? The Maharaj is much perplexed and has received an order to the elfect, that the petitions presented by the ryots should be disposed of within 15 months. Such an order has been issued, and the Dewan Saheb has been removed from office, and prohibited from visiting the bungalow {i. &lt;?., the Residency). Let this be known to you. I receive no news whatever from you. You should send me news frequently. I am doing well here. Do not entertain any anxiety. The people in the bungalow send their compliments to you. Convey the same to the butler. Yeshwunt Rao Naik has gone to Bombay. Let this be known to you. Shabuddin is also to go (but) I have no correct information.

Secondly, Bapoo Saheb Gaekwar had come. He (the Saheb) enquired, ' well, how are you ? He answered that he was well by the Saheb's blessings. The Saheb then enquired. Do you go to Dadabhai and Shabuddin for your business ?' Then Bapoo Saheb answered as follows :—' There is no necessity for my going (to them). As long as you are here, it is not necessary for me to go to any one.' What do these people know of the admi nistration of justice and what do they do. These people ask each other's advice, sit doing nothing, and enjoy themselves. Thirdly, the Punekar said :—' Saheb all the people became glad on hearing the reports of a cannon, assembled together, and began to say that some great Saheb had come from Bombay to 85 22enquire into the cases of all. On account of this happy news all the people had collected.' Then the Saheh said :—' The gentleman is the General Saheb who has come from Ahmedabad to review the regiment. Fourthly, Rukhma Baee's brother has presented a petition. He says that his sister should be made over to him. The Saheb became very angry with him. Fifthly, I shall come to-morrow bringing with me Cawasji. You should-therefore send Salam. No. 6. TRANSLATION. B hawn P unekar said to the Saheb as follows:—Nana Saheb Dewan is • The word also means mai- moving about with a view to kill* me. He is t^eatlng • moving about taking men with him, with a view to kill (me). He (Nana Saheb) was standing with fifteen or twenty men near the Sawak's Dharamsala at 12 o'clock yesterday. One man came and enquired of a Patewela where Bhawn Punekar was. The Patewala told him that he was not there. Then the man went away. The Patewala went to the Saheb while Bhawn Punekar was sitting by him, and said that Nana Saheb's men were searching for Bhawn Punekar. At that time Bhawn Punekar was sitting by the Saheb. Then Bhawn also said to the Saheb that Nana Saheb's mea were moving about with a view to kill him. No. 7. TRANSLATION. T he Saheb enquired of Bhawn Punekar what had been done about the Siledars. Bhawn Punekar replied that all the Siledars having assembled toge ther went to Dadabhai yesterday, but that he did not give any proper answer. The wish of these three persons, viz., the Sarkar {i.e., the Gaekwar), Dadabhai, and Nana Saheb is not to make any arrangement whatever about them. Bhawn Punekar informed the Saheb that Dadabhai had a dispute with Nana Saheb, saying that it would be necessary to make arrangements about these people about whom arrangements were to be made, and that it would be neces sary to make arrangements about these people also whom the Saheb might name. But Nana Saheb is not at all inclined to make any arrangement. ^In this way the Saheb was informed; and the Saheb told Bhawn Punekar to take to him a general statement, showing what Siledars there were in the service, and from what time they had been employed, adding that it was customary with them (Europeans) to grant pensions, and that therefore he (Bhawn Punekar) should take a detailed statement, showing from what time they had entered the service, and for how many years they had served.

The Government of India will be glad if you will consult the Standing Counsel and give then a joint opinion, stating how far you coincide in the opinion of the Advocate-General of Bombay.

Paul, Esq., Officiating- Advocate-General, Calcutta, lo C. U. AircHisoN, Esq., C.S.I., Secy, to the Govt, of India, Foreign Dept. I have the honor to acknowledge jour letter dated 12th January instant, and in accordance therewith I beg to enclose the joint opinion of the Standino- Counsel and myself on the subject therein mentioned. I also return all the papers forwarded to me. OPINION. H aving carefully perused all the papers we have formed the following opinion :—If by the expression ' sufficient to warrant a conviction' the Advo^- cato-Gcncial of Bombay means sufficient to commit for trial we a^ree with him; but if by that expression he means that a conviction by an inferior Court ought to be affirmed on appeal by a superior Court we do not agree with him having regard especially to the fact that there has been no hostile cross-examin ation of the witnesses. It must be remembered that skilful cross-examination and defence may brincr forward matter which may give a very different complexion to the case ! And on carefully weighing this evidence, we think there is ground to suspect that the conspiracy, if found to exist, may be one against the Gaekwar and not bv him. We would observe that the bearing of the evidence as regards the minor criminals is wholly different, and the case against them may 0 well be true although there may have been nothing to justify the introduction of the Gaekwar's name, the evidence affecting him involving the grave improbability of a man &gt; in his position personally trafficking with people in the position of the witnesses who have been examined.

B e it known that Whereas an attempt has been made at Baroda to poison Colonel R. Phayre, C.B., the late British Resident at the Court of His High- 87ness the Gaekwar, and evidence has been adduced to the effect that His High ness Mulhar Rao Gaekwar instigated the said attempt to administer poison to Colonel Phayre; And Whereas to instigate such attempt would be a high crime against Her Majesty the Queen and a breach of the condition of loyalty to the Crown under which Mulhar Rao Gaekwar is recognized as ruler of the Baroda State, and moreover such an attempt would be an act of hostility against the British Government, and it is necessary fully and publicly to enquire into the truth of the charge and to afford His Highness Mulhar Rao Gaekwar every oppor tunity of freeing himself from the grave suspicion which attaches to him; And Whereas in consequence thereof it is necessary to suspend Mulhar Rao Gaekwar from the exercise of power and to make other arrangements for the administration of the Baroda State: It is hereby notified that from this date the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council temporarily assumes the administration of the Baroda State, and delegates all the powers necessary for the conduct of the adminis tration to the Agent to the Governor-General and Special Commissioner at Baroda. The administration will be conducted, as far as possible, in accordance with the usages, customs, and laws of the country. All Sirdars, Inamdars, Zemindars, and inhabitants of the Baroda territories, and all officers and persons whatsoever in the civil and military service of the Baroda State, or liable to be called upon for such service, are hereby required to submit to the authority of and render obedience to the said Agent to the Governor-General and Special Commissioner during such time as the State may be under the administration of the British Government.

No. 114A.P., dated Fort William, 13th January 1875. From—C. U. Aitchison, Esq., C.S.I., Secy, to the Govt, of India, Foreign Dept., To— Col. Sir L. Pelly, K.C.S.I., Agent, Govr.-Genl., and Special Commr., Baroda. I am directed by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. , dated 7th January 1875, submitting the information obtained by the Commissioner of Bombay Police in regard to the attempt to poison Colonel R. Phayre, C.B., late Resident at Baroda, together with Mr. Souter's report, the opinion of the Advocate-General of Bombay, and your own opinion on the case. 2. The Governor-General in Council has consulted the Law Officers of Government at Calcutta on the evidence which has been adduced to the effect that His Highness Mulhar Rao Gaekwar instigated the attempt to administer poison to Colonel Phayre. 3. It is a matter of the deepest regret to the Governor-General in Council that so grave suspicion should be attached to the Gaekwar's name, and the Governor-General in Council considers it necessary that the facts of the case as they affect His Highness should be fully and publicly enquired into, and that His Highness should be afforded every opportunity of clearing himself from the charge. 4. As it is impossible for the British Government to maintain political relations with a Prince against whom there rests the grave charge of having instigated an attempt to murder their representative at his Court, the Governor- General in Council regrets that he is under the necessity of suspending His Highness Mulhar P^ao Gaekwar from the exercise of power and of temporarily assuming the administration of the Baroda State. 5. I accordingly enclose, for your information and guidance, a copy of a Proclamation which the Governor-General in Council has determined to publish in the Gazette of India. The Proclamation has already been sent to you by telegraph with instructions that it should be carefully and accurately translated into the vernacular language of the country and published throughout the Baroda territories. 6. As soon as the Proclamation is issued the administration of the Baroda State will vest in you under the powers delegated therein, and you will take on your own responsibility all steps which may be necessary for the preservation of peace and order and the due exercise of all the functions of Government in every department. Matters in regard to which it may be necessary or desirable that you should obtain the instructions of the Government 89 .2390 of India should be specially reported to this Ofliee, and I am particularly to request that such report may be made before any important changes are intro duced in administrative measures or machinery other than those reforms which, in my letter to the Bombay Government, No. loSGP., dated 25th July 187 were ordered to be carried out consequent on the report of the Baroda Commission. 7. It has already been arranged in communication with the Bombay Gov ernment to strengthen the force at Baroda by a strong wing of European In fantry, one field battery of artillery, and a battalion of Native Infantry. These troop's will probably be sufficient as a precaution against any disturbance of the peace. But it is essential to have a sufficient force to prevent any disturbances, and if now or at any time you consider it necessary to have further reinforce ments, you are requested at once to apply to the Bombay Government for them. The Bombay Government will be instructed to comply with any such requisition you may make. 8. I have already telegraphed to you to take steps for the arrest of Mulhar Rao Gaekwar and his honorable confinement in one of his palaces or, if that be thought an unsuitable place, in such other suitable building as you may con sider most convenient. At the time of his arrest Uis Highness should be informed of the charge against him. His Excellency in Council desires that every consideration be shown to Mulhar Rao, and that his confinement should not be stricter than may in your opinion be necessary to ensure the proper investigation of the case which will be conducted by a Commission to be appointed here after. When the Commission is formed you will afford the Gaekwar every facility for appearing before it either in person or by Counsel. You will also afford him every opportunity for submitting to the Commis sion any statements or explanations he may wish to make and for bringing before the Commission any witnesses or evidence he may desire to produce. You will further permit under proper precautions any one to have access to His Highness whom he may wish to consult or to employ in the preparation of his case. 9. Care should be taken to prevent the witnesses from being tampered with, and generally such precautionary measures should be adopted as you may consider necessary to ensure the case being fully and fairly laid before the Commission. 10. The orders of His Excellency in Council relative to the constitution and procedure of the Commission will be communicated to you hereafter. In the meantime I am to say that the Commissioner of Bombay Police will, with the permission of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council, carry on such further enquiries as may be necessary, and that, while every facility is to be given to the Gaekwar as above described for laying his case before the Commission, nevertheless, in the event of Mulhar Rao not availing himself of them, the enquiries of the Commission will still proceed, and the Government of India will take such action on their report as the results of the enquiry may justify. 11. The persons more immediately concerned in the attempt to murder Colonel Phayre will be dealt with hereafter. 12. The vernacular papers marked Nos. 1 to 7 which accompanied your letter under reply are herewith returned in original. y O No. 114B.P. Coi t T /v to Bombay Government for information and any action that may be needed under paragraph 7, and with a request that, with the permission of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the services of Mr. F.

A lthough His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council cannot anticipate the results of the enquiry ordered in my separate letter, No. 114A.P. of yesterday's date, it is nevertheless necessary to be prepared in the event of their proving unfavorable to His Highness the Gaekwar. 2. You are therefore requested to report, for the information of the Governor-General in Council, who are the surviving representatives of the Geakwar's house, and what are their respective claims to be selected to rule the Baroda State in the event of Mulhar Rao Gaekwar being permanently set aside. 3. His Excellency in Council will also be glad to receive any remarks or suggestions you may desire to make as to the manner in which a native administration should be re-established at Baroda.

I then accompanied His Highness just beyond camp limits, and there intimated formally to him the necessity for his being detained. He is lodged with the Residency Surgeon, who is his personal friend, in the best house in cantonment, which is on several accounts preferable to his bein 0 * in the town. His Highness protested his innocence, and constantly asked that the enquiry might be conducted by the A iceroy and myself. He will be treated 'with every consideration. I have summoned the Sirdars and principal men of all classes to the Residency for interview, and caused during the night the Government intentions to be explained in the city I have Informed the Commander -in-Chief and the Chief Magistrate that I hold them responsible for the peace.
