Kemball also confirms that the tribes of the Batinah coast have also been reconciled with the Sultan of Muscat.Kemball's letter encloses letter no.163 of 1853 (folio 250) from Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, addressed to Kemball and dated 20 December 1853. Robinson's letter is a covering letter, which in turn encloses four reports, two of which were sent to Robinson by Lieutenant R. Stradling, Commanding Officer of the Honourable Company's schooner
                           Constance, dated 9 November and 17 November 1853, and two sent to Robinson by Lieutenent D. Dakers, Commanding Officer of the Honourable Company's brig
                           Tigris, both dated 30 November 1853. Stradling's report dated 9 November 1953 (folios 251-52) states that the tribute demanded by the Wahhabi chief from the Imam of Muscat has been paid, and the former's forces have departed for Brymee [al Buraimi]. Stradling's second report, dated 17 November 1853 (folio 253) reports on the discovery of the captured Buglah [boat] at Muscat, with the majority of its crew and passengers having disappeared.The first report from Lieutenant Dakers, dated 30 November 1853 (folios 253v-54), is a more general report of the
