Foreign Office. -r \ &gt; / | \ 6888 ^ J 1 Dear Laithwaite, I cannot find anything in the Bombay Political Consultations of 1825, or in Despatches of the period, as to the posting of an Agent of the Bast India Company to Jedda, but it can be deduced, I think, that the Pasha 1 s commercial Agent there was employed at that time by the Company and suitably rewarded for his services. (Please see attached extracts from Consultations, etc.) Jacoul (or Abim) Youssouf was appointed Acting Agent by the Governor of Bombay (The Bari of Clare) in 1831. I have not been able to trace Colonel Campbell’s letter to the Secretary of the East India Company of July 14tn 1837, mentioned in Sir A.Ryan’s note, but please see copy extract of Secretary’s reply, dated 28th October 1837. Apparently, the original correspondence between Colonel Campbell and the Company is not extant. I hoped to find the Colonel’s letter in your »x. Departmental box, No.3; which at one time was in the Lantern Gallery, but cannot now be found. I'-rttsr? ^ .INDIA OPFICS, AHITKHALL, 1 ^eth October 1004.

British Representation in Jetida up to 153th Hogarth (Arabia 1921, p.109) states Hiat Great Britain not only placed her Arabian conaxlar service under direct Imperial control, in 1825 and raised the status and quality of her representatives - a measure which France countered by mailing a like change in her own service at Jidda - but, in 1839, she required the petty sultan of LAHBJ to lease to her in perpetuity the port and peninsular of Aden.... * Philby (Arabia, 1930, p.lll) says that '‘....it was about the year 1825 that the status of British representation at Jidda was raised by the posting of a consul to that port.J I Hogarth’s statement does not necessarily mean that a British consul was appointed to Jedda. Neither writer quotes any authority and I now find Mr. philby doubtful as to the origin of his belief. In a letter of July 14, 1837 from Col. Campbell, British Agent and Consul General In Egypt, to the Secretary of the East India Company (Extract enclosed in his despatch of the next day to Lord Palmerston) said “...the Agents of the Honourable Company at Jedda, Suez and COS SEX R have always been appointed Consular Agents and have their Patent from me as such and also the firman from the Viceroy, asking the local authorities to recognise them as such.... 11 . The correspondence just cited relates to a proposal to replace the native agents previously appointed by the company in the places named and at Mocha by English sub-Agents, who should at the same time be British Vice-Consuls or uonoular Agents. The Foreign Office appears to contain no record of individual Consular officers earlier than 1837, except a7 - 2 - mention in the Consular Lists of June 1835 of one JACOUL YOU330UFP holding the post of unpaid British Vice-Consul, a mention which recurs in the Lists for December 1840, although c in the interval the new arrangements had been made as follows:- F.O. despatch No. 14 Consular of August 4 1838 to Colonel Campbell authorizing him to appoint the three new packet agents of the East India Company at Suez, Jedda and C0S3EIH to be British Vice-Consuls, unpaid. The first person appointed to Jedda under this arrangement was ARCHIBALD OGILVIE, appointed in 1838. He held the post until 1851 when he was relieved of his duties owing to illness. There appears to be no record of a further appointment in that year and the next incumbent would appear to have been CHARLES JOHN DUNCAN COLE, who was Agent of the Company and was Vice-Consul from November 19 1852 till November 20 1858, when he resigned. STEPHEN PAGE, who was killed at Jedda in the massacre of June 15 1858, was apparently Acting Vice-Consul only. A new system was inaugurated in 1859 by the appointment, as salaried Vice-Consul, of GEORGE EDWARD STANLEY, appointed January 13 1859; arrived May 15, 1859; promoted H.M. Consul July 6 1860; finally left July 1, 1863; transferred to Alexandria April 24 1864; Consul there 1864 to 1874; Consul General at Odessa 1874; Consul at San Francisco 1883 till retirement in 1886; died July 31 1903. T. or P. POLAT acted for Stanley as Vice-Consul at Jedda for some months in 1859. Stanley apparently left his French colleague in charge. The next appointment was that of RICHARD CHIARRANDA MABRY STEVENS appointed Consul</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00018b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/120</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00018b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/120</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 6888/34 History of British Representation in Jedda</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-11-08T22:01:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (9 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in reverse chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 9; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
