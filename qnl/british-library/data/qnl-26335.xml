I am to express regret that investigations»into this matter have been protracted owing to the division of the former India Command into the separate Commands of India and Pakistan. 3. It has now been established ^that the 10 Hind Propellers were issued from the United Kingdom on Transfer terms to Number 337 Maintenance Unit, India, for re-issue on repayment to the Afghan Government through the Government of India. Owing to the urgent need for these stores, it was agreed that they should be delivered by air. The propellers were despatched by air on 28th March, 1946, from Holmsley South, in ten cases each weighing 448 lbs. under Air Freight Serial Number 05894* F.C.B. Numbers 178253/1 to 178262/1, Flight Service Number U.I.Y. 573, consigned to Number 337 Maintenance Unit, Avadi, Madras. On receipt of the propellors Number 337 Maintenance re-consigned them to Royal Air Force Station Peshawar, on Form 600, Issue Voucher Number F/640 dated 16th May, 1946* This was an error as Form 603 (Repayment Voucher) should have been used. On receipt of the propellors under cover of Form 600, Royal Air Force Station, Peshawar, did not bring them on charge but handed them over to the Afghan Government representative in accordance with instructions flWWAir Headquarters, India. 4.
