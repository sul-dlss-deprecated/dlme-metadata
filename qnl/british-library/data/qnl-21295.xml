On 24th April 1935, Lieutenant Tutton and Flight Lieutenant Goats arrived on the seaplanes and asked me to arrange for five boats which I did according to their wish. 3. On 30th April 1935, s.s.Baroda arrived from uasrah and discharged articles such as cement etcetera which were intended for Abu Dhabi and Sir Bani las, into two boats. As the night was very dark, one of the boats, while sailing at the mouth of the harbour of Libai, dashed at an anchor which has been lying there since a long time unknown to anjrboay, and was consequently damaged. Immediately Husain bin Hasan made his launch tow the boat as far as the Pier of Dibai. The cargo was removed from the boat so as to have it safe from arowning. The Supervisor Muhammad Khan was present watching the work. The cargo of the boat was saved with the exception of a small quantity of cement which caught moisture. On the morning of 1st May, Lieutenant Tutton ordered that another boat should be arranged. This was done and the cargo was immediately loaded on it according to the advice of the Supervisor Muhammad Khan. On the morning of 1st May, two boats sailed for Sir Bani Yas and three boats sailed for Abu Dhabi. Also, on 1st May, H.M.S.Powey arrived in the evening ana picked Plight Lieutenant Goats and Lieutenant Tutton with «;hom I sent my cousin Abdur Rahman bin Huaain and Muhammad bin Abdullatif. 4.

Air Facilities on Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. »o Dear Colonel, ' ^ With reference to your letter Ko»C/52 of 1935 dated 19th March 1935, and to the discussion with the Air Officer Commanding 1 Iraq on 18th May 1935, I have to make the following observations ;~ IIJWAlTe ^ facilities which will be required at this place will consist of a floodlight-beacon to be provided by the Air Ministry, and at the same time. Imperial Airways have asked for a refuelling shelter. I am not quite clear as to the precise form which this shelter will take, but I do not suppose that it will be much more than a screen or wall serving as a wind-break. It may prove desirable to lay down a hard runway, but a definite decision on this point cannot be made the at the present time• AS described by Mr, lintwistle, it is desirable that a meteorological observation station should be established at Kuwait. Subject to the concurrence of the India Meteorological Department. Mr.Sntwistle suggests that suitable men of local origin should be trained in making observations^ and paid for their services. It is quite possible that the establishment of such a station will involve securing a small plot for the erection of a meteorological office and for the installation of the instruments used for observation. I understand that you consider the employment of local talent would be very desirable* it is nrobable that the facilities at Bahrain will need to be extended.. Additions may have to be made to the W/T Station, as it will be necessary to substitute Adcock direction-finding equipment for the existing Bellini-Tosi. The signal station will also have to Keep longer hours of watch! This will result in an increase in staff, and presumably an increase m living accommoda tion. It may also be found MCess ^ T ^ 0 ;^ r ^' e h _ d at extended facilities for passengers. It . :L f ^ the moment to translate such expansion into terms oi buildings, land, etc# gAM PMD. indicated in the schedules forwarded, raauiraments at this island are confined to the location of m airway beacon. This will be of the 'unattended' type, but naturally will have to be visited from time t^ time. From R.A.F. information it f is Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B»S#, The Hon'ble Political Hesident, Persian Gulf, Bushire .~2- impracticable 'to construct an aerodrome on this island# DAS ISLAITD. It will be necessary to instal an airway beacon of the 'unattended' type on this island. Subject to final confirmation from the Air Ministry, a landing ground will not be needed# SHAiUAH * The provision of additional accommodation for passengers is at present under consideration# Extension of the W/T organisation will probably necessitate still further aecoimnodation# At present I understand that in your judgment conditions do not permit of the construction of such accommoda tion outside the fort# KALBA . An emergency landing ground with a petrol store, and possibly some sort of shelter for passengers is required# From inform tion available, the provision of such a ground would appear to be easier 4t Kalba than at Dibah, although should, for any reason, it prove impossible to proceed with Kalba} Dibah might be substituted# ^ The ground at Kalba would be eh used only in ease of an emergency, but would need to be of dimensions adequate for the requirements of civil aircraft, and would have to be maintained up to the proper standard# Maintenance, of course, would not be the responsibility of the Shaikh. It is desirable that an airway~ beacon ( n un- attended' type) should be erected at Kalba/Dibah# DEBAl - H^S j AL KHAIMAH # Imperial Airways have actually asked for Debii as their refuelling halt, but in view of the experience of the Royal Air Force, it would appear that Has al Khaimah is better suited for such purpose# The alighting area at Debai is confined, and under certain conditions of tide and wind, it would be difficult to take off a heavily loaded flying boat# This will be brought to the notice of Imperial Airways, and the Company will be advised to establish their refuelling halt at Ras al Khaimah in preference to Debai* At whichever site is finally selected, it will be necessary to arrange for facilities for passengers# This is the commercial responsibility of the Company, and will probably mean the provision of some form of craft, suitably fitted, lying at anchor, or a building on shore# The petrol company catering for the aircraft will also need storage Xacilities. W/T facilities will also have to be arranged between the refuelling point and the main signal station at Sharjah# This may involve the establishment of a small W/T Station ashore, or possibly it may be found convenient to locate this on board a suitable vessel# Moorings will need to be laid for the use of seaplanes, and the Air Ministry^mmld arrange for the provision of a control boat to be provided# These vessels will periodically have to be brought ashore for cleaning and overhaul, etc* The above organisation will necessitate the employment of a considerable number of individuals for whom housing will have to be provided# 2# It is understood that arrangements have already been made /made for the following s- AiIL£H^I• m ISLAND. - Airway beacon. - Airway beacon and landing ground 3.

S. Political Agent reported that on receipt of letter ^haikh had adopted truculent attitude and further refused to express regret for his discourtesy. Later Shaikh (presumably influenced by proviso 4 of my telegram No:B/l3) agreed to construction of petrol store but Political Agent suggested action against pearling fleet should be used to extract expression of regret. I replied that this was out of the question and that Political Agent should concentrate on main objective, i.e., construction of petrol store leaving question of apology to be settled later. 4.

Shaikh of Mra Dhabi « Sir, I have the honour to report on proceedings and events at Abu Dhabi on the 9th June 1955 and subsequently* 2* ii»M#S Fowey arrived at Abu Dhabi at 09.00 hours on the 9th June 1936 and two and a half hours later the ^haikh came on board to call on Consssander Harvej and me* fie was accompan ied by his three brothers, Eazz&amp;, Khalil and Eaid, his maternal uncle, Haaid bin Butti, and his cousin, ^ihaiasiad bin -halifah. No one else was present rxcept Co wander Harvey, CoKucander Back, Officer ^omaanoing, H. k. S Lupin, Flight-Lieutenant Coates, Liaison Officer, R.A*F., in charge of the construction of the aerodrome at Abu Dhabi, Khan Sahib Saiyid Abdul Razzaq and Husain, cousin of and acting for the Residency Agent. X append separately trie general gist of the conversation which took place between m and the Shaikh and of this I have given a copy to CQjnnsander Harvey to ensure that there could be no difference of opinion as to what took place and whet was said. From this, however, there are two important omissions:- (a). i die. not follow all the Shaikh said. After presentation of the Honourable th^/^olitical Resident^ letter he gradually worked himself /into @ Political Agency, Bahrain, the 13th J une 1935V into a frenzy of temper and Khan kahlb Salyid Abdul Razz.aci informs m that he also said do at least call on His -ta, jesty 1 s '-hips even if I do keep them waiting. I am not iiice c . qj£0 other on the Coast preferring ^ I oresume to Bas al feaiaah) whom you do not threaten even though they refuse to call on His Majesty's Ships 11 . (h). After the %aikh f s party had gone ashore accompanied by Husain the latter informs m that the'Shaikh* s uncle, Khalifah, offered him advice in Majlis using the following words:- ^lou should not have spoken to the r olitical Agent in that disrespectful way. Now you will have to make tvo apologies. Xou had better ao it now whilst you can. It is only one wore anc the British aren't urJcind. As soon as you apologise they will be friendly and nice and helpful to you again and it is to your advantage to be friendly'. 3. I sent Husain ashore with the &amp;haikh with orders to return anc report in the evening. This he old bringing me a verbal aessage from the Shaikh that he was prepared to permit the construction of the petrol store and beacon but on no account would he apologise or core on board any of His Majesty's Ships. I gathered from Husain that the Shaikh aware of the consequences of open obstruction to the building of a petrol store and beacon at Abu Dhabi had nevertheless taken umbrage at the honourable ^ . . . . t Mn• r 1 M qq dated the 5th ^une 1935 Cytiie Political Resident's letter »o:G/iaJ ^ determined to resist the construction passively namely, Intenance of an offensive and Insulting attitude towards I I His Majesty's Ships which .ould make dealings with him so degrading to British prestige as to be Impossible. I had no option but to interpret this attitude of the Shaikh as obstruct- ive to the prime object, namely, the construction of a petrol I store and signalled to the honourable the Political Resident t * «« 4n hpck with a verbal to ssage to the accordingly* 1 sent husain t&gt;ac&gt;x . tj e f -r- would proceed to sea after ! Shaikh reminding him tnat d.k.S Fov.ej vrauxa 10.SO hours the next day, 10th June 1935. 4. I recalled Husain at 11.00 hours on the 10th -W 19S5 /and and was by mmj 7? and he informed me that despite wiser counsels from his relatives and the open hostility of the people who feared that the ^haiMi's conduct would lead to immediate action against the pearling fleet the Shaikh refused to apologise, %is confirmed m in the belief that the %alkii proposed to use this passive aseans of resisting the construction ashore, and was merely playing for time until the pearling season mas over when effective action against him would he impossible. I, therefore, signalled my views to the Honourable the Political Resident and requested Commander Harvey to proceed to sea towards the pearling fleets. In this decision I was actuated by the following considerations:- (a) Both Commnder Harvey and 1 felt that it was undignified to reimin at ^'bu Dhabi after the expiry of the tim limit which I had given the %alkh the previous day# (b) I had inloraed the honourable the Political Resident of ..the time limit and I expected that orders would be received before 16.00 hours which was the earliest Coimaander Harvey expected to reach any pearling fleet. (c) That in the event of no orders being received no harm could cosse of H.M.S Fowey anchoring at sea whether in the vicinity of a pearling fleet or not and the opportunity could be utilized to gather Information*. 5. H.M.S Lupin remained at Abu ^habi to provide a means of communication should the ^/iailch change his Bind. 6. H.M.S Fowey anchored near Rak. as Lakum shoal at 15 • o0 hours, and Comnander fiarvey with my concurrence sent Husain in a boat to exaoine the pearling fleet. The largest and Incidentally the only Abu Dhabi boat belonged to Ahmad bin Khalaf, the principal pearling merchant of Abu Dhabi. J-he Nakhudah accepted an invitation to come on board and as soon as he did so he enquired whether the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had called and whether his attitude had been satisfactory, -o this he received no reply nor any indication of whet had happened. As by dusk no orders had been received, in /accordance4* in accordance with ay expressed wish the Hakhuuaah ! s boat was Invited alongside and came, the Wakhudah asked and was per- fitted to spend the night on board EUM.S Fowejr* ^he crew and divers of his boat were regaled with good food, cigarettes, and what they valued most, plenty of fresh water. %e rJakhudah was wost reticent concerning the dispositions of the Dhabi pearling fleet# The crew and divers of his boat were not questioned* During the night orders were received from the Honourable the Political Resident directing the work ashore to proceed and, therefore, the boat after replenishing with water returned to the pearling banks# ?• In consonance with the honourable the Political Resident's orders H.M.S Fowey returned to Abu %abi arriving at 09*00 hours on the 11th June 1935♦ Flight-Lieutenant Coates and his party were landed i mined lately and I satisfied myself ■ that he considered himself and his party secure ashore. Of this I could not satisfy myself personally since owing to the Shaikh 1 s attitude I could not land# I then proceeded in H.M»S Fowey to Sir Bu Ha'lr Island since ^oraander Harvey considered it highly undesirable for H#M#S Fowey to remain at Abu Dhabi, a view concurred in by the Senior Officer, Persian ^ulf. In the evening final instructions were received from the honourable the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf aad I, therefore, requested Cocgnander Harvey to take me back to Bahrain signalling before departure to the Honourable the Political Hesident ay final views with regard to the situation at Abu Dhabi, I have the honour to be Sir, lour roost obedient servant.

To give him one immediately after this affair would not impress the other ShaiMi recipients of its value. 2. Shaikh should be given two days to brood over this letter If after that his attitude is truculent I think it can safely be interpreted as passive resistance and hence obstruction. The seizure of the first two pearling dhows would bring him to heel. 5. i recommend also that I should bring to the notice of all Shaikhs the desirability of having a representative on board all of His Majesty's Ships at once to arrange interchange of calls.

I visited Abu Dhabi on the 23rd June 1955• ^he Shaikh of Abu Dhabi came on board H # M«B To my at the pre- arranged tiise. He was extremely frightened and incapable at first of coherent speech. The deaseanour of Co isander Harvey, and I hope myself, reassured him* le then expressed what I considered was sincere regret for his previous insulting conduct and stated that he valued highly his Treaty rights with His Majesty 1 s Government# He assured me that there would not be any further or future reason for co&amp;plaint against him. 3# I am of opinion now that no good purpose can be served by withholding the Shaikh's Jubilee Medal or his pay* Vhe Shaikh feels that he has suffered very largely as a consequence of fallowing the bad advice of others. Although I think that it would have been possible to obtain the Shaikh's apology under the conditions and circumstances mentioned In my above quoted telegram, X do not think that this form of /ultimatumI (53) 2. ultimatum (for this is how it would be interpreted by the Shaikh) can be issued to him. 4 # I therefore request that on say forthcoming visit to Abu Dhabi I may be allowed to present him with his Jubilee ' ■ 1 , ! ■ ; V ' ■' ' ,1 Medal# X have the honour to be Sir, Your asost obedient servant, Captain, Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain#CONFIDSHTIAL. D.O•No.452-S of 1935. The Residency, )w Bushire, the 27th June, 1936. CVwcj I Please refei ^rcfcorrespondence ending with my telegram No .SGl'Tdated the 25 th Jmier 1935, regarding the resumption of payment of rental to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi• 2. The question of compensation to the Royal Air Force for the extra expenditure which has resulted from the Shaikh 1 s obstruction has not been raised officially by the Royal Air Force authorities. It was merely dis cussed informally and 'without prejudice 1 ' between Coates and myself. If desired^ however, there would appear to be no difficulty in the way of the Royal Air Force present ing a claim of say Rs.1,500/. 3. Now that the Shaikh has given way both over the petrol store and the apology to the Commanding Oixicer of H.M.S.Fowey, I think it would be a mistake to insist on payment of compensation as such, especially as the Air Ministry require further air facilities from him by way of permission for the .erection of beacons on his islands of Halul and Das. It seems to me, however, that the question of compensation might be used with advantage with the Shaikh as a lever to obtain these additional facilities. 4. , mat I have roughly in mind is that you should ■ on the occasion of some visit to the Shaikh, approach him verbally /on the following lines; 11 Your / Captain G .A.Cole, I.A., Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain.izs) //o -2- ' Your obstructive attitude lias resulted in the loss of some Rs.1,500/- to the Royal Air Force over pay of officers for the extra time involved, wages of labourers, hire of boats, etc. etc. and the Royal Air Force are proposing to put in a claim for the amount to be deduct ed from your monthly rental. The claim is of course the Resident quite justified and normally L could not ask them to withdraw it. Fortunately for you they want, too, very small facilities at Das and Halul Islands in the shape of one beacon on each island. If you meet them over this, for a small consideration, say, Rs.10/- per month the Resident for both beacons, ^ will suggest to the Royal Air Force that in view of your accommodating attitude they should not press their claim. If you do not agree, 1 am afraid that the sum of Rs .1,600/- will have to be deducted from your rental 11 . 5. I shall of course have to consult the Royal Air Force before this line can be adopted, but previous to doing so I would be glad of your views, which please let me have without, at this stage, consulting the Royal Air Force. The next payment to the Shaikh will not fall due until the end O j . this month, and some weeks 1 delay to enable me to consult the Royal Air Force authorities will not greatly matter. ^ _ cCONFIDENTIAL.

I am quite convinced that we cannot withoid payment or even suggest it without causing trouble similar to that which we have just been through. I think before accepting th* apology we coula have dictated any terms we liked, bat having accepted it and made peace threats veiled or other wise would merely antagonize him again. 3.

Reference your U/o D.3413-No.35, and your U/o 3546 # 11.351 dated 5th and 15th August 19351 respectively, i- The sheltered water available for use as seaplane anciiorages on the Irucial Coast consists of creeks which run some distance inland. There are a number of these creeks, most of which contain sufficient depth of water in one part or another to permit of their use by seaplanes. They vary mainly in the amount of safe water available, in the number of directions in which alighting and taking-off is possible, and, most important of all, in the extent to which the safe water is clearly defined. 2. I thoroughly reconnoitred all the creeks along this coast in 1931, and to the best of my recollection full reports with sketches were submitted at the time to the Air Ministry, and in any event should be available in the files at Air Headquarters, Baghdad. However, I think I can remember clearly the three creeks mentioned in these conmuni cat ions. 3. At UMALQUAIWAIN there is plenty of water, permitting alighting into practically all winds at all stages of the tide. The limits of the safe water is, however, very undefined, being bordered by large areas of shallow water and semi-submerged mud banks, very dangerous for flying boats. The alighting areas would, therefore, require to be thoroughly buoyed and lighted before they could be safely used* An equally strong objection to the creek is the lack of firm banks in the vicinity of the alighting areas. The deep water is for the most part separated from the shore by wide stretches of mud only passable at high tide. A site for a civilian air station of this kind should permit of : (a) the location of a Rest House reasonably accessible from the flying boat; * (b) the flying boat itself being brought up to a pier or jetty; (c) the provision of slipways on firm ground. No(a No facilities for these requirements exist at UMAL6UAIWAIN except in the imnediate neighbourhood of the village, where the smells are more intense and more aggressive than at any other village I know on that part of the coast, which is saying a good deal. The natives live on fish which is supposed to be dried in the sun but which to Western noses is in the last stages of putrefaction. As the only obvious sites for a Rest House are in the neighbourhood of the village itself, they are on this account unsuitable. These difficulties could, no doubt, be got over at considerable expense, but I do not recommend the place. 4« The best of these creeks is that at DIBAI, near 3HARJAH* This was the creek which I strongly recommended should be used by Imperial Airways when they first opened the route# There is plenty of water and the bends in the creek give adequate directional facilities. The banks are firm and clearly defined and the deep water extends right up to them, A certain amount of buoying and lighting is recomnended. There are good sites for buildings, slipways, jetties, or anything else required. The sites are clean and some distance from the town which is vastly superior in every way to UMALQUAIWAIN, It is the place at which B, I, liners call and is relatively rich and civilised, 5, Next to DIBAI, I would reccmnend RAS-AIrKHAIMAR which has been largely used by H,A,F, flying boats, lUS-AL-KHAIMAH has an excellent creek, but it is practically one directional only. Fortunately it lies into the prevalent wind but at times aircraft can only use the creek by alighting or getting off across wind, #iich is not desirable There is plenty of water and the banks are firm and well defined. There are excellent sites for buildings, slipways, jetties, or anything else required. The chief difficulty at RAS-AL-KHAIMAR, which 1 regarded as suitable from a technical point of view, was the obstinate refusal of the Sheik of RAS-AL-KHAIMAR to allow the establish ment of a civil air station in his creek, 6, I would strongly recommend that Imperial Airways should use the creek at DIBAI, and as I am sure it is suitable from the technical point of view, I do not know what their objections to it are. Failing(S&gt; I Ho Failing DIBAI, I recommend RAS-AL-KHAIMAR, and I do not recommend UMALQUAIWAIN for the reasons given above. 3d/- S. R.

I explained that Imperial Airways aeroplanes had to fly a long distance from Gwadur to Sharjah and that during the monsoon they sometimes had to fly against heavy wind and that there was therefore the possibility of their running short of petrol and finding it difficult to cross the mountains and get to Sharjeh. I said that Government were anxious to have en emergency landing ground at Kalba and reminded him that I had mentioned the matter to him before. I said that what was wanted at the landing ground was marks to facilitate landing by day and a light for flying by night and that a store for petrol would be required and also a small shelter for the passengers. I explained that nothing of the nature of a mahattah was required but that I thought that the Comxa ny would want a small building like a barasti or perhaps one or two rooms made of farush or something of tlr t kind, 3. The Shaikh replied that he would be glad to assist Government in any way he could and that he would speak to Shaikh Sa*id bin Ham&amp;d. He said that his brother, Muhammad, who has been out collecting zakat,had pa id a visit to Kalba on his way back and had only returned a week ago. If he had known about the matter previously he would have asked him to speak to /(&amp;) to Sliaikh Sa 1 id. 4. I said that Shsikh Sa» id would probably expect some remuneration and said that this was a small Aatter and not a question of a big thing but thought that Government agree to pay a fixed yearly sum of perhaps two or three hundred rupees. I emphasised that this was my personal opinion and could not say whether Government would pay or not and that any arrangement which he may make would have to be subject to the approval of Government. 5. I asked him when he would be likely to speak to Shaikh Sa'id about this and he said that he do so after the diving had been over and accounts had been settled up. I asked him if he would be able to do it iJL before Ramadan and he said he thought that he could. He said that he would either go to Kalba or ask Shaikh Sa f id to come to Sharjah. 6. I then added confidentially that 1 understood that Shaikh Ba* id bin Hamad had no son and was an old man and that if any successful arrangement was made i through him for such a matter as a landing ground it would naturally support any claim that he might lave to . ■' suzerainty over Kalba, 7. Shaikh Sultan's brother, Shaikh Muhammad, was present at this interview. 8. Shaikh sultan mentioned the activities of the people of Fujairah which had been, he said, under Sharjah and the people admitted this but they had encroached by means of purchasing land until only one tower was left to Sharjah and they now claim this tower as theirs. 1 did not wish to get involved in this matter /-3- matter so I did not try to probe into wla t he meant by purchase and so on. This Fujairah dispute is one of old standing and was the cause of Shaikh Sa'id turning rather to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras a 1 Khaimah than to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar as the former lad helped him when an appeal to the latter had proved useless. to the Political Agent, Bahrain, with the remark that this note should be submitted to me on my return to Bahrain as Political Agent.

Air Facilities on the Trucial Coast. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 20th Hoveiriber ll'-SS I proceeded to Sharjah 'by air and embarked in H.M*S Lupin {Coi^ander T.H.Back). I arrived at Abu Phabi the next morning and Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan cassa off at once to call upon me. I returned the Shaikh^ call early in the afternoon and told him of the object of my visit. The next day ohaiMi Khalifsh bin -aid returned, from Baraisd and was present vfaen ve resusEd our discussions. His return was saost fortune.te as he is a wlae old mn, yftio knows the outlying portions of Abu Dhabi territory well and is able to curb any tendency on the part of his younger relatives to claim places 'vhich do not really belong to them. She result of w enquiries was cossmnicated to you in rry telegram dated the 4th November 18S5 from H.M.S Lupin (which was subsequently given a number (150) ^hen relayed from Bahrain). S. I understand that the Air Officer CoEnending, British Forces in 'Iraq, end the Senior Saval Officer in the Persian /GulfI2. Gulf received instructions to help Hp .Cross, Onager, Near Sast Area, Imperial Airways ^imlted, and t?.o Vincents and H#M»S Uxpin were placed nt his disposal to exuible him to ©XBSine the creeks at Dubai, Umm al Qaiwain and Has al Khaliaaii. 4. After w visit to Abu Dhabi H.M.S Lupin had to roceed to har J ah to fuel and, as I had received your telegram Ho #£10 dated the 50th October 1 35 saying that there ^as no objection ' to his visit, I telegraphed to Wr. Cross suggesting that he should meet tie at 'hrr.jah, -hich he did an the morning of the 3rd Noveiiber. 5. Although I was anxious to return to Baiirain for certain pressing work, I thought that it was advisable for tse to take ^r» Cross to -Jxm al -atwain s^self, as 2 thought that it v/as just possible that certain interested persons aight try to upset matters at TJrm al al?/ain i&amp; the hope of securing the flying boat anchorage for themselves. As it was the Shaikh of Urisi al : iaiT/ain made no difficulty about Mr. Cross examining the creek. 6» On the afternoon of the ZrC. November Cross and I flei?? over Cubai, Uzsm al Qaiwain and Has al Khaljaali, with Coamnder ®ack and lieutenant H.K.Tod (Navigator of H.M.S iiUpin) in a second aeroplane, examining the creeks at high tide. On the following asorning W* Cross and I ezassined O'mru al Qaiwain and Dubai from the air at low tide. 7, On the ©orning of the 4th November Me. Cross accoisijan- led by Lieutenant Tod made soundings of the creek of Um al Qaiwain from a nDtor dhow and, though it was not possible for them to form a definite conclusion, Mr. Cross considered that the results would probably warrant a detailed survey of the /creek.3. creok# 8. As I had urgent business at ^rhrain, I returned by Viftcent (in ^ich the Eoysl ^-ir Force had kindly offered me a seat) and left Khan Bahib Saiyid »Abdul Hazsaq to acco^any Mr, Cross to Siarjah. 9.

My dear Crombie, With a view to improving the directional finding and other wireless facilities at Sharjah prior to the inauguration of the Empire Air Mail Scheme in 1937, the erection of an Adcock D»F* station on the hillock, approximately 900 yards north-east of the Rest-house, and a building to house the remote control wireless transmitters, approximately 900 yards north-west of the Rest-house, is contemplated at an early date. The two proposed buildings would be about 1300 yards apart and, as already stated, each 900 yards from the Rest-house. Neither are, K strictly speaking, 'additional facilities' but are ^7 ' ■ improved 'models' of the existing D/P» and W/T. stations uj whi di are now installed within the Rest-house. By locating them at some distance from the Rest-house much greater efficiency will result. In this connection the question of the defence of th6 two new buildings arises. Personally, I feel that the | local conditions at Sharjah are now such that no special arrangements are needed and that it should suffice for the Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform the sheikh of the removal of the W/T. stations to the points mentioned above and get his assurance that they will be adequately covered by the Defence scheme now in force at sharjah. We/ 'ombie, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.C53 17? We should, therefore, like to instruct the A.O.C., Iraq, to investigate the question of the defence of these two ne?/ buildings (in consultation with the Resident) so that we can as soon as possible assure the Director General of Civil Aviation that he need have no qualms as to the security of the two new buildings. Will you let me have your views? Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) G. C. PIRIErnnfidentlal.

Commander Harvey had taken the R.A.F party to Abu Dhabi He said that the Shaikh failed to come off to the Ship until sent for by him and eventually came on board 4 hours after the 'Fowey' had anchored. His attitude was friendly. When the question of the petrol store was broached by Flight- Lieu tenant Coates he refused to. allow its construction on the ground that it was not mentioned in the agreement. As a result the dhows containing stores and material for its construction had to return to Dibal. 5&gt; Captain Fisher and c ommander Harvey thought some action should be taken at once to restore our lost prestige.

Resident 1 s telegram ^o:4S8 dated the 4th May 1935 fey pend- Resident 1 s arrival vide your note above -ip-iig irost obvious c .y of bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi with regard to his action over air - l acilities ould be to stop his tawwasha boats taking supplies to the Abu Dhabi pearling boats and bringing pearls back. S. If this v re done the pearling boat will not last out more than three weeks. Fishing boats of Abu Dhabi will be allowed to ply their trade in order that the population shall get their food. 4. The tawwasha boats are large craft built especially for carrying large quantities of food and are easily recogniseable at any rate to the expert eye and an expert will be provided. Tf the pearl banks, however, are s ituated near bai then it is possible that owing to the distance of the banks from Abu Dhabi that the Abu Dhabi pearl boats tav.v asha from Dibai or/and Sharjah. This complicates the problem. 6. Queries. (a) How many pearling boats as a whole does Abu Dhabi possess. (b) How many pearling boats does the Shaikh himself own. (c) How can they fee identified?• ^ - d) Identification marks? (e) Name? (f) Name of Nakhudah? (g) Does the Shaikh own the Bat11, i.e., the Ac iral of the Pearling : Fleets shit). 7. Even if the Abu Dhabi pearling boats TOuld tawvasha from other tav.vasha boats, e,g. 5 those of Dibai^ the stores laid in at Abu Dhabi for their own tawwasha business will be wasted. This is on the assumption that the Abu Dhabi pearling boats tawwasha from Abu Dhabi. ^ I ^ -i..-.»'■&gt; ;• ^ B• It is probable that the Abu Dhabi L, ^ '^y/ ' pearling boats tawwasha from Abu Dhabi \&amp;y * otherwise they would have to bring the pearls back to Dibai. 9. In addition to .stopping taw/asha - travel papers, and all other facilities would be stopped. J. , n. . i . -C? 2 ?) 13th May 1935. Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan 'Amad, Assistant Residency Agent,Sharjah, says that Abu Dhabi owns ^ 0 ^ s ' ^ ese boats get their advances and supplies from Ahmaa bin iaiaa£ Jaa n Ji it.aibah who is the chief pearl merchant. They are now diving the Khanchiyah which will be over within 15 days time. When the Khanchiyah is over they go back to Abu Dhabi in order to take supplies and within 5 days time they start again for the big Ghaus(Diving), which lasts for four months. Usually a big boat can take supplies ■'.or a ^ ou t one month while_small boats can tske fnr s fortnight♦ Whenever they are short of supplies they retar n to Abu Dhabi to take rations or write to Ahmad bin Khalaf who sends his cargo boats with supplies. The launch of Ahmad bin Khalaf goes out for collecting the pearls from the Diving Boats but does not carry supplies for distribution among his boats. Should these boats be preventea from going to Abu Dhabi for aupplies,they will be able to buy the same from the 8.1)6 nearest place to the bank they/diving. When tiiey are permitted by Ahmad bin 'Utaiabkh they can get supplies on creait and give a draft against Ahmad bin 'Utaibah vhicL can be co^iecteo. at the close of the diving season. Khan Sahib Husain suggests, for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh, that Ahmad bin 'Jtaibah shoulc. be from going out for He also thinks thst if theywhole fleet is £reventea from PiTiBg- it will have a better affect. The Living Boats of Abu Dhabi get their water supplies bj purchasing the same from the v/ater-boats who come from Khasab, Dibai and ais.(a) (t) (c) W ( e ) li! ikj its Adu Dhabi(alone and not incluaing/other indepenaencies ) posses 58 aiving 'boats. Nil By sending a person who can ideniiify them from other boats They have no special marks All the boats of Abu Dhabi are Sambuks The Shaikh has no battil. The Aaoaral of the Fleet . ship is Khamis bin Khalaf When they are short of supplies they go to Abu Dhabi to take their needs. 1SUNDAY the 9th June 1935. H.M.S.Fowey arrived at ABU DHABI at 09.000hours with H.B # M*s Political Agent Bahrain on board. The Shaikh came on board at 11.30 hours. He was accoffipanied by his three brothers, HAZZA 1 , KHALI®, and ZAID, his maternal uncle HAMID BIN BUTI and cousin MUHAMMAD BIN KHALIFAH. Political Agent delivered a Letter from the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the store and beacon. The Shaikh was enraged and lost his temper and when the second letter about his discourteous attitude to H.M.S.Ships and Officers was delivered to him and discussed, he said that he did no -vrong to the Government in order to send him a threatening letter nor did he misbehave or refuse to call on H.M.S.Ships like others. That unlike other Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast he was of miszK assistance and help to the High Government and that he expected to get a 'KHAL'AH* (Robe of honour). He said that when he saw the Men-of- War he felt very happy and that he came on board in order to have the pleasure of meeting the Political Agent and the Officers of the Ships, who instead of -ing bring/a present, they jprought him threats. He said that the de ^ay for not coming to the ships as soon as they anchor As due to many reasons such as the absence of bott the distance from the shore or other unforeseen circumstances and thus he did not consider that the complaint of Commander Harvey was rjustif iecjfespecially when he informed him that he was sick on the occasion of his visit. After usual compliments and courtesy, the a great 9.6,35Note regarding conversation which took place on H.M.SJTowey between the Political Agent,Bahrain and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi- After usual compliments and polite conversation, refreshments and coffee, P,A # informed the Shaikh that he wished to speak to him on a private matter and had a letter to deliver to him from the Honourable the Political Resident. The P.A. asked the Shaikh if he wished his relatives to retire. The Shaikh replied 'No 11 . P.A. then delivered the Honourable the Political Resident's letter No.C/199 dated 6th June 1935. As Shaikh had difficulty in reading it Khan Sahib Saiyid tAbdur Razzaq read it to him. The Shaikh at first became reflective and then showed annoyance. Before,however, he could make any temarks, which,from his appearance and attitude seemed likely to be offensive, the P.A. delivered the Honourable the Political Resident's second letter in the hope that the Shaikh would realise that he had caused considerable annoyance to His Majesty's Ships. After pointing out the honour that His Majesty permits His Ships to show him by according him a salute the f e A. appealed to the Shaikh to realise that he should have appreciated this by being punctitious both in calling and receiving calls- and that his discourtesy on three recent consecutive occasions to His Majesty's Fowey deserved some expression of regret. The Shaikh then lost his temper and harped on the Political Resident's first letter concerning a light and beacon, and made no reference to the subject of calls. He said that he was undeserving of a threat- eilng letter a»a had co.e oft to H.KAFo.ey 1= «peot- ation ot a Kobe ot Honour (Jlhal'ah). Mtead, ho.av.r, when /X/W when he was being most helpful the P.A. brought him a letter containing threats and that if this was the way His Britannic Majesty's Government treated him (here slapping his hands) he had no more to say. The P.A. reminded the Shaikh that he had given his written consent to the construction of a petrol store and beacon and that there was no further use in discussing consequences if he had not done so and that all that was now remained/for him to express his regret to Commander Harvey for his past possible unintentional lack of courtesy and that therefater the former happy relations between us all would be restored. The Shaikh replied that he had always kept His Majesty's Ships waiting before without complaint and that he saw no reason to alter this habit in future and that he would come off to ships at his convenience. P.A. then asked Shaikh why he had kept Commander Harvey waiting for half an hour when returing his call at a prearranged time during a visit of His Majesty's Fowey on 2nd May ,1335. This was not a question of keeping a ship waiting but a matter of ordinary manners and hospitality to a guest* In reply the Shaikh said that he was ill( a fact that carried no conviction since were he really ill, he would have sent a message to that effect to Commander Harvey- as is usually done by other Shaikhs) # The Shaikh continued in this attitude and refused to express regret to Commander Harvey, Since his lack of self control was leading him quickly towards adopting an insulting attitude tov/ards the P.A, in particular and the British Government and Officers in general, the P.A. concluded the meeting and warned the Shaikh that should his attitude remain unchanged the probable consequences /-5- consequences were known to him, and that should he wish to consider his conduct he was free to return to the ship, call on Commander Harvey, apologise, and thereafter both Commander Harvey and the would return his call ashore. The P.A. allowed the Shaikh until the following morning in which to decide, and in the meantime told the Shaikh that he could not receive the honour of a salute, but that if he returned and apologised he could of course receive his customary salute. The P.A, then withdrew and the Shaikh despite being persuaded bu his uncle, Hamid bin Buti, to apologise was seen over the side by Commander Harvey without making use of this last easy opportunity of doing so. 10th June 1035.

November 1925, the Political Resident and I discussed the cmention of air facilities at Kalba with the Shaikh of uharjah at Bahrain. He said that he had written to the of x.dba and that on his return he would send his brother to try to arrange for the facilities. He, however, pressed for the help of G overnment. It was put to him that a Shaikh who was unable to rule for himself could hardly expect to receive the support of Government but that if he was able to take action they would no.doubt in their turn help him. It was put to him that this was rather a test oi whether in the event of the death of the Shaikh of -alba (v.ho has no heirs) the Shamaliyah track would be — -c reed as belonging to him. He seemed to see the point and' said that he would do his best to help. He. did not wish to go himself as was suggested as he feared a rebuff but would send his brother to pave the way. What he wanted to know was whether the Shaikh of Kalba would demand money or whether the Shaikh of Kalba would disown the suzerainty of the Shaikh of Sharjah. ^e promised to let us know the result in about three weeks time.

The principal correspondents in the file are Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent at Bahrain, and Captain A Cole, Officiating Political Agent at Bahrain.The main issues raised in the volume are:1. Disagreements between British officials and Shaikh Shakbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi, over the installation of a petrol store at Abu Dhabi, not officially mentioned in the agreement signed between the two parties on 13 February 1935, and only verbally agreed upon. In a letter addressed to the Shaikh, dated 5 June 1935, Fowle threatened action against Abu Dhabi’s pearling fleet, should he continue to raise objections to the expansion of air facilities in his domains (folios 64-66). Fowle’s letter led to an angry exchange between Shaikh Shakbut and British officials aboard HMS
                           Fowey(reported in a letter from Cole to Fowle, folios 93-97), which in turn led to protracted mediations prior to Shaikh Shakbut issuing a formal apology over his outburst (folios 122-23).2. Proposals for a seaplane anchorage at Umm al-Qaywayn (folios 138-40a), including a visit to the Arab coast by Mr B Cross, Manager of the Near East Area for Imperial Airways Limited, in order to ascertain the best site for such a facility (folios 185-87).The volume also contains a number of revised schedules of air facilities required along the Arab coast of the Gulf, listing facilities by both location and by RAF or civil aviation function (folios 68-72, 173-75a, 196-200).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
