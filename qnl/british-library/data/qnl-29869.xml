You would be pleased to hear that on 27th Hajab last ( 23rd September 1938) we proceeded to Sur to enquire into its affairs, there we found Shailch Ali bin Abdullah al Hamudah Bhaijch of Beni Bu Ali at Ja’alan. He came to interview us and we granted him an interview. We saw nothing in him but submission and obedience. Having spent the time fixed for halt at Sur, we returned to Muscat on the 10th Shaban ( 5th October 1938). We brought Shaikh Aii bin Abdullah with us to further confirm his submission and obedience. He stayed with us at Muscat for about two weeks arxl then returned to Sur and whence to Ja’alan. As the man has improved his conduct ana showed his obedience, we have fixed a monthly allowance for him and granted him certain exemptions from Customs dues which were prohibited to him since the year 1932, when he showed such an attitude, which necessitated the ceasing of the grant and allowance to him. It is hoped that Shaikh Ali will continue his present behaviour. Usual linding*Estimated fames of places and Sheikhs, strength (Rifles). Provinces Heiuaikb DHIBAH.

To relate these mould serve no useful purpose for it is clear that Sulalmaa bin Kaayar of the Habhani, All bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali and lea Bin Saleh al Harthi have met and come to soma decision. They must either require the Sultan's co-operation, or hare a demand to make from him. Whatever it may be the Sultan doss not seem to be taking the natter seriously, for he has sent a casual reply to gulaitaan bln Haayar, though once he did agree to see him at Maslrah. ^ 3 .

He/- Ihe Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,■MIH •—- 9HMR -a- !• Mt out from Sib by lorry to tho foot of tho hill# whore, •iter eonalderable difficulty fro* the guide loot the way, «e picked up the easel a which had been sent on ahead overnight. We entered the hllla at Raaal, and contlmied eastwards up the '-adi Raeal for acne two hours, and passed the nail villages of Jafnain and Maraira. At Maxmira the track winds through tha hilla, and after passing Batih, leads to Fingeh. There was no running water In the valley in contrast to wangr others we travelled in later, and the village water supplies are fron weUs. The hillsides near the villages bristle with old watch towers, all of which are abandoned, Fingeh can be described as a snail town, and is situated on a northern elope overlook* ing wiles of fins date gardens planted on the north aide of the river bed. There la a fair alsed perennial stream of sweet water which supplies the town and gardens. The town la pro tected by two large towers situated on promontories at each end of the town which lw built on a cliff &lt;rn&gt;y iiawg 4 iag the val- lay. These forte were newly whitewashed, and in good repair. 5. Trcm Fingeh ee rode aouthwarda up the valley passing the villages of Sham, 'inlkat, ftllayana and Kurts, until ea arrived at Bidbid. This la a large village which gets its importance from the presence of a square serai type of fort in which the Wall Uvea. neither he, not the Qasl, were there rtien I passed through. At Bidbid I mm for the first tins fields of wheat and other crops watered froa channels on the Persian system. There are only date palms at Fingeh, we found It impossible to buy lucerne for our camels there. Fod- der should be brought from Bidbid, and 1 think we were thought te be rather stupid for not knowing this. 6 . From Bidbid we rode over a broad stony plain for about two hours before we entered the Bed! Small, north of Surur Surur la the most northerly village of a number dotted at In tervals along the banks of the valley for stout 12 miles. At the northern end of the valley the date and fruit gardens are not remarkable for their fertility or the sise of the trees, but in the centre of the valley in the neighbourhood of the fort I saw the finest date gardens I have ever seen. There are larga/«mKmmm - 3 - large aango and other fruit trees also. We spent one night at Sue&amp;il in the guest house of the Wall. He ms most hospi table and friendly, and sent me a lank for dinner. This ms a great treat, especially for dwellers in Muscat where the only seat killed, except on rare occasions, is one goat a day. Re told me that the lack of rain in the last few years had resulted in a diminitlon in the number and size of the flocks due to the lack of grazing. This my be so, and It la quite true that there are very fee flocks to be seen. With the next breath, &gt; however, he complained the excess of rain last susmer had ruined the date crop. To point out that the rain would eventually re sult in an addition to the water supply by reviving the springs ms a too long-term policy to be received with favour. The rain does not really spoil the date crop, but the drying of the dates. In Oman there is a kind of date which they gather just before it Is ripe, and boil in large earthenware pots. They then spread the boiled dates on the river bed to dry. If it rains during the drying period considerable loss is sustained. 7. At Sunail numbers of Sheikhs and the leading Qasl visited me in the guest house garden where 1 sat under the large mango , trees. They talked a little of the war, but did net ebc*Hj*re*' , ~ / Interest in it beyond Its effect upon themselves. They asked me if the 'control system' were an invention of the British Gov ernment, and if I thought that It was necessary. They said that it caused great hardahip to themselves as it resulted in their being short of doth and grain. I replied saying that certainly in war time it was absolutely necessary to control supplies. When we were warming to the conversation the wall suddenly asked to be allowed to leave for a few minutes. Whereupon he and his greybeards went away and held a confabulation just out of earshot behind the guest house They came back after what seemed an In terminable time, for it ms nearly 11 6 'doek at night and 1 had been riding all day, and turned to the weather as a subject of conversation. I suppose their native caution had overcome them. 8 . The Small fort is a large stone building perched on a rock some 100 fast high in the middle of the valley where it broadens out a little. There is a small basaar there where stinking fish !•/-u -4- is sold. Ths people buy nil! quantities of this, and carry it hone dangling on a pises of stick, end that is not to bs wondered at either. Ths entrance to ths wallsy Aron ths south is guarded by two large forts also situated on ths top of out crops of rock. I took photographs of these, but could not do so of ths Sunail fort as ths tifcli said that ths taking of photo graphs was against his religion. It is Aron ths south of Small that ths Jsbal Akhdhar is first assn. 9 . Is continued mtr journey ewer barren atony country in a broad ‘valley about 10 adles serosa. After a 3 hours* rids it narrowed to a pass by which ws entered ths Wadi Ruwahi. Ths northern entrance of this walley is guarded by ths usual towers and forts built on rocky promontories, but here ths fortifications are strengthened - or were for all is now falling to piece# - by a wall linking then up. There was acre soil hers and each Tillage - ws passed Wlngeah, Qttelay and Murella - has its wheat fields ir rigated in ths Persian style, as well as date gardens and nango tress. After s 5 hours' fast rids we arriwed at Jensh at ths southern end of ths Wadi Ruwahi. This is ths hone of Sheikh Haned bin Fiawid, who was once In ths serrlce of ths Sultan of Muscat, but idis now lives on hie own property through which travel lers fron Muscat and ths Batlnah must pass to reach Meswa, ths town of his father-in-law, ths Iwsn. Bs was Tory pleased te see ns, sad during ths halt of s day and a half took ns for walks in ths hills sad gardens. Bs asked nmerous questions about ths war, and regretted that his radio waa out of order. I haws sent it to India for repairs, but after its return an faced with ths preblew of supplying him with charged batteries. 10. Bs told ns that ths Imn waa wary ill and that it was not thought that he would live ouch longer. Bs said that that was ths reason for Sheikh Sulalnan bin Kaayar's going to Kanll to ^ west Sheikh Isa Bin Saleh al harthl. They wished to settle^ policy to follow after ths lawn's death. According to Hawed bln Baadd their plan was to divide Onan into two parts, and for Sulai- naa bln Hawyar to rule ths western part and Isa bln Saleih ths eastern. Baaed was concerned that ths Sultan waa apparently playic Ing no part, and he asked as if I know ths reason. I knew nothing about/* 6 - vast*. It would bo difficult to use It all for the banks of the valley are rooky and steep and uasuited to cultivation. An attenpt was once aade to carry it froa one valley to another as is evidenced by a long eater channel built veil up the noun- tain side so as to keep the water at &amp; high level to get it over a saddle into the next valley. The story la that the work was started by a rich nan to take water to an almost water less village as an inducement to a certain villager to part with a lovely daughter. They eey that the rich asn died before he had completed the work. • 13* The Journey I am afraid does not sake an exciting tale, but aa a preliminary it has achieved more than I could have hoped for In establishing contact with the Jabal Akhdhar Sheikha, and ascertaining their attitude towards the British Oovemment.

The Sultan arrived at Sur on the ^ 4th May and was successful in persuading the Shaikhs to come to Muscat as his guests. The nature of their business was not disclosed at Sur and since their arrival at Muscat the Sultan has been busily engaged in doing everything possible to impress them. They were taken out to Bait al Falaj and shown the armoury, and musketry practices from Mirani fort have been an almost daily occurence. Today they are being entertained at a special banquet and the Sultan has asked to be allowed to bring them to the arab dinner I am having here on the 19th. Both Shaikhs were present when I made aqy official call on the Sultan on the 16th. The Sultan considers that the object of the meeting of the two Shaikhs at Sur was the strengthening of the Ghafiri Confederacy to which they now wish to secure hie approval and support. He hopes to start discussions within the next day or so but I do not expect to hear the outcome before the mail closes. The Hon'ble Lt. Officiating Col. A.C.

Do'ar Colonel Galloway, I Would you please refer to my Deal-official letter Ho. S.771-8/62, dated the 17th. May, 1945 and ay telegram No.R.l, dated the 28th. May, 1945 regarding tribal affairs? 2. When I saw his shortly after ay return from recess, the Sultan told we that he vas very pleased with the result of his talks with the Omani Shaikhs. He had found Shaikh Suleiman's attitude particularly enewrarincT and said he felt that this might be the beginning of a more general more of the Shaikhs of the hinterland in his favour. He des cribed Shaikh All as 'a completely changed man* (by which he means that he can now rely on his support) while he thought that in Shaikh Sulaiman he had a powerful ally in any future dealings with Oman and, what ill more important, one on whoa he could rely. While expatiating on the position these two Shaikhs occupied in Oman, the Sultan made the statement that provided Shaikh Isa of the Sh&amp;rqisjb4kept his word and remained neutral, he was confident of being able ^©'occupy'' Oman on the death of the Imarc without bloodshed. Any opposition that did occur would be fro» the Hinawia and its extent would largely depend on Shaikh Isa. 3. Whether or not his intrigues with these Shaikhs included the accelerated demise of the Lmra remains to be seen; the Imam is now an old man, but reports indicate that he has recovered from the recent illnees and is on the move again. What, howevar, seems certain is that ranch of the Sultan's time Will be devoted to preparing for the day when he can occupy the principal forte of the interior. The alarm of the Imam at the present turn of events is indicated by his efforts to dieuade Shaikhs All and Sulsiman from meeting the Sultan at Sur, the despatch of spies to Muscat during the Sultan's talks with these Shaikhs and hio summons to Shaikh Sulaiman to visit him at Kizwa as soon as the latter/ The Eon'ble Lt. Col. A.C. Galloway, O.B.W., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf•2 latter returned to Sakl. To what extent ShalVh Ise will be capable of counter measures is difficult to eay, but tbe situation in the in terior is likely to remain uneasy. 4* Ibe unification of the State under his rule has always been the Sultan's chief objective, and hie lack of weans of achieving it, his greatest dlsappoint’r.ent. With the State now in possession of substantial financial reserves, the position has changed and it seems likely that for some time past he has been giving a good deal of thought to the fulfilment cf his ambition. His anxiety to se cure the services of a competent adviser, his avarice over money, hie desire to avoid a change in his Military Adviser at the present tlir.e, his request for lorries of military pattern for his levies to stand up to bad reads, his attentions to increasing his anaotay, his interest in wireless equipment and his recent efforts to obtain from the Americans at SsJ.ol&amp;h and Masirah any Military transport they xaight wish to &amp;m!t% of, can in ay view be nso ,t easily understood if they arc considered as being the preliminary stage in his prepara tions. The second stage - the croation of a fifth column - appears now to he well under weigh, and the third stage - the actual occupa tion of the strategic points in Ha jar - is apparently planned to take place isnediately news of the death of Iiasr. is received. 5* Fro*a the Sultan's profai^nce for the ease and coafort of his retreat at Iftiofar and Me previous apathy towards the administrative affairs of the State, it might be considered as unlikely that he would be capable of suscaonlng the necessary energy to achieve his aim. When, during a recent conversation on this subject, I interjected that all this would appear to mean that ho could no longer retire for long periods to Salalah, he agreed at once and added that if event* developed favourably he would be content with only, short visits to at Lend to his affairs there. He had, he said, in any case postponed bis departure to Dhofar until the end of December, arid thought it uiilikely that be would **vsn return then. No more forceful indication of his enthusiasm could, of course, have been given1 6. The Sultan’s Intention of attempting to unify his State raises certain important questions of policy which rmj be considered in the light cf th© following pointsi (a) The Sultan has more than once hinted that he will expect assistance from His Majesty's Government. (t) It is not impossible that matters my come to a head be fore the end cf the r;ar. (c) Any overt efforts tc discourage the Sultan from the present intentions/-intentions night load to a crisis in political relations with hist and cause his to look elsewhere for support. So far as the first point is concerned I nade no comment apart froa observing that it was not ordinarily the policy of His Majesty 9 s Government to interfere in the internal affairs of Oman. * As regards (b) I think it unlikely that the Sultan proposes to carry out his intentions with the support of tribes alone; he made some mention of this when I last saw him saying that one of his chief difficulties would be to find reliable followers and there can be little doubt that the Mnscai Levies will form the basis of his militazy preparations* Thess Levies are, of course, paid for from the Ear Subsidy and commanded by a British Officer - facts which might raise certain complications in the event of the death cf the Imam before the termination of the Subsidy and the period of deputation of the Military Adviser. In the case of (c), to any suggestions that it would be better to leave things alone the Sultan could argue and, I think with considerable fo^e, that (a) Xt the tribes were willing to accept him as the Imam's successor - and his talks with Shaikh Suleiman gave him every indication thatythat would be the case • he could not be expected to refuse. (b) fes acceptance by the tribes would render the Sib agreement in-operative, (c) jk&gt; far there ie no indication of a successor being found in Oma^ who would have the support of the more important factions.) (d) Intervention by him on the death of the Imam would probably the only method of preventing the interior falling into a state of complete disorder, (e) If he allowed events to take their course, the security of his coast line and in particular of Muscat and Matrak would be jeopardised and the resources of bis state frittered away in endeavouring to ward off incursions into the coastal area. (f) it is undeniable that the future prosperity cf the State lies in opening up its richest and moot fertile region. (g) Kia aim of becoming the da facto ruler over all his State is an entirely legitimate one which should receive at least the sympathy of Bis Majesty 9 s Government. f. In recent times policy has been to discourage the Sultan's interest in the interior while doing everything possible to strengthen his position on the coast line - a policy based largely on eventa leading to the agreement at Sib in 1920 in which the tribes of Oman achieved verlual independence. So far as our interests are concerned, this policy has been successful in that more settled conditions have replaced the chronic instability of the Sultan 9 s Government which so often necessitated interference by His Majesty's Government. The arrangements made at Sib however, were doubtless regarded by the Muscat Government as being in the nature of a pis aller necessitated by the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to do more than mediate in differences with Oman and their own lack of resenreea. It could hardly/*I hardly be supposed that the A1 bu Said would acquiesce in this state of affairs in perpetuity and it is the natural sequence of events that, when in a position to do so, they should seek to retrieve some thing of their former position* It is quite certain that the pre sent Sultan is determined to pursue his ai» whet ever the difficulties nay bet he undoubtedly feels that the balance of power is now swinging steadily In his favour and has hopes that his newly won supporters will produce further adherents to his cause - at any rate fro» amongst the Ghaflri Shaikhs. 8. For the present ft any rate I think you will agree that it would be unwise tc give the Sultan any encouragement in these activities and I suggest that our policy should continue to be one of non-in terference in the internal affairs of Oman. Any sign of encourage ment from us might cause him to force the pace and precipitate events while he has the advantages of the presence of the Royal Air Force in his territories* a subsidised levy and the loan of a British Military Adviser and Indian Officers. I would not, however, suggest that this be actively discouraged more than is necessary to secure conformity with policy and the avoidance of anything likely to af fect the tronqui3fity of the State. He is not likely to be deflected from his desire to acid eve a long cherished ambit ion and any opposi tion would be bitterly resented. By nature thorough in method and cautious in outlook hi.a present eagerly expressed hopes may be taken as an indication that the support he lias already been offered is substantial and that he considers that success in his venture is as certain as it can be. 9. Uhlla I do not see that there is suxiicient for attempt ing to restrict the use of the Muscat Levies to their present purely defensive role, the presence of the Military jidviser in any operations in the interior could scarcely be interpreted as nen-iuterfercnco - indeed in Muscat it would be taken at once indicating that the Sultan had the full support of His Majesty's Government. This dif ficulty could probably be got over by the of Saiyid Tariq, the Sultan's half brother, who has recently returned from India after training both the Zhob Militia and the Chftgai Levy Corps. The Sultan may already have this idea in taind, for Tariq inforraed ate shortly after his return that he expected eventually to take over the Levies from the Military Advisor, 10. In view of the foregoing and the fact that the Sultan has now come into the open in regard to his intentions I think that a statement of our attitude is desirable, and suggest th* • I be au thorised to inform him orally that there is no change in Kis Majesty's Government general policy towards the internal affairs of Oman which they regard as bejng a natter a domestic concern, but that/-% -5- • that Hla Majesty f a Government trust that he will take no action likely to upset the tranquility o£ the interior and so to affect the security of British interests. If the question of the use of the Muscat Levies is raised I suggest that he be Inforsed (a) that His Majesty's Goveraa nt have always regarded the protection of Muscat and Matrah as a natter of vital importance to their interests and that they presume that nothing will be done which 1# likely to expose these areas to the danger of attack from the hinterland and (b) that the use of the British Military Adviser in military acti vities designed to extend his influence in Oman would be inconsistent with His Majesty's Government's general policy already indicated. Any request for assistance in the farm of military stores can be con sidered if and when it is received. 11.

Reference -^r The Sultan visited me recently at the Agency to discuss the State Budget for 1945, and, when I again drew his attention to the need for in vesting the now substantial reserves in his Treasury, he replied that he did not intend to make any decision on this until December when he hoped to have a clearer idea of the way in which affairs in Oman might develop. He then went on to discuss in some detail his hopes for the consolidation of his authority in Oman. 2. No Ruler of Muscat, he said, could remain satisfied with the present state of affairs. In the past the sense of frustration produced by the realisation that, with the meager resources of his State, there was little hope of the re establishment of the authority of his House in Oman in his time, had made him feel acutely despondent. Now however the position had changed: the State was sound financially and had a substantial reserve; he was now able to entertain and give presents to the influential Shaikhs of the interior in a manner befitting his position; and above all he now had the means to acquire arms and ammunition to enable him to support his growing influence with force. The Imam could not be expected to live much longer: with a show of force and the support he hoped to receive from the tribes, action taken immediately the news of the Imam's death was received would enable him to re-occupy Oman without bloodshed. He intended to make no move until the Imam died, but in the mean time wished to inaxe whatever preparations were possible, firstly by encouraging friend ly relations with the more important Shaikhs, and secondly by preparing plans for military operations designed to seize certain of the forts. The first of these two preparatory stages was his concern, but the second - on which everything depended - would only be possible with the assistance of the British Government. He would require additional military stores and equipment, including artillery and would need the assistance of British officers. In discussing these affairs he wished to make it clear that whatever advice were given him by the British Government he would accept, though he sincerely hoped that this would not be unfavourable to his in tentions. His aims were clearly reasonable, for v/ithout its unification (Signature) under/- S. 44. MFP—1016 S&amp;P--(M.1870)—9-2-39—20,000. (Designationunder his Rule, he could see no future for his State. Did the British Government wish Oman to remain as it was? This he could not believe. He fully realised that the successful control of the interior would depend upon him personally and would give him a great deal of added responsibility. He was confident, however, of his ability to manape the tribes, who were generally dissatisfied with their isolation* when the time came he would perhaps transfer his capital to the interior. The Sultan concluded his statement by a request for an indication of the degree of support which he might expect from His Majesty^ Govern ment. 3. In reply, I informed the Sultan that the matter would be referred to the Political Resident for instructions, but that in the mean time he should do nothing which would be likely to upeet the tranquillity of the State by acting In any way contrary to the agreement reached at Sib in 1920 on which his present relations with the interior were based. I added that the present time, with the war against Japan still to be won, any interference in the internal affairs of Oman which might lead to disturbances would, I was sure, be particularly unwelcome to His Majesty^ Government. The Sultan assured me that he had no intention of taking any action, either before the death of the Imam or contrary to the ad vice given to him by His Majesty 1 s Government and that he fully under stood the particular importance of internal peace at the present time. So far as the Sib agreement was concerned, he admitted that so long as the Imam remained in authority he was bound by its terms, but said that between the time of Mohammed bin Abdullah al Khalilf s death and the election of a successor the agreement would be in abeyance, with the tribes once again in a position of independence and at liberty to enter into separate agreements with whomsoever they wished. It was because the success of his venture would depend on his ability to act before the appointment of a successor that he wished to know the attitude of the British Government as early as possible. 4* The political affairs of are still mainly influenced by the division of the tribes into the two great factions, the Hinawi and Ghafiri which took place in the 18th. century. Territorially there is no di viding line between the two factions and the fact that throughout Oman Hinawi and Ghafiri adherents live intermingled has led to the upholding of the balance of power and to the recognition of the importance of a modus vivendi . Religiously, the Hinsaris are mostly Ibadhis while the Ghafiris include a substantial proportion of orthodox Sunnis. Both factions have their centre of influence and power dominated by a reco gnised leader. The centre of Hinawi activity has always been the Shar- qiyah with the principal Shaikh of the Hirth tribes at its head: and astute leadership of a people more inclined to fanaticism than the in habitants of the rest of Oman has given the Hinawis a controlling voice in the councils of Imamate in spite of the numerical superiority of their oponents. The Ghafiri confederacy is centred in the region of the Jebel Akhdhar and the Wadi Sumail and its leader is the chief Shaikh of the Beni Riyam who claims descent from an ancient dynasty of Maliks . The Ghafiri have, in addition, a strong supporter in the person of the Shaikh of the Beni Bu All, a powerful tribe of the neighbourhood of Sur. Very generally speaking it can therefore be said that the main current of events in Oman is controlled by three persons - the principal Shaikh of the Hirth, Shaikh Isa bin Salih (Hinawi), the Shaikh of the Jebel Akhdhar region, Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar, (Ghafiri) and the Shaikh of the Beni Bu Ali, Shaikh All bin Abdulla (Ghafiri). The last of these Shaikhs is under the effective influence of the Sultan, and his interest in the Imamate is concerned with purely factional issues. In securing, through a packed house, the election of a relative as the present Imam, Shaikh Isa's influence remained paramount for many years. Now, however, Isa is an old man, incapablebf any great physical exer tion, while fortunately for the State his sons do not appear to possessmmmm Iiiippsw.iy, mh . J ■ J-.iWL 1,1 ■3 any of the qualities which would enable them to maintain their father 1 s position. flhile Hinawi influence is therefore on the de cline - the Sultan received a letter from Shaikh Isa some months ago stating that he intended take no part in any affairs relating to the future of the Imamate - the two Ghafiri Shaikhs have shown much acti vity in strengthening their confederacy, and, what is important to the subject of the letter, a desire to support the Sultan. Their meeting at Sur In February, their willingness to remain there for over two months until they could see the Sultan, and their prompt acceptance of his invitation to them to be his guests at Muscat were developments of great significance. This was not only the first that the Shaikhs had met, but also the first time Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar had Visited the Sultan and the only occasion on which he had travelled outside Oman. The ensuing conversations at Muscat gave great satisfaction to the Sultan who is certain that both Shaikhs will actively support him in his aims. These Ghafiri activities have naturally caused consternation amongst the Hinawi faction and the present state of the interior is uneasy and likely to remain so. 5. To this brief description of the state of affairs now prevail ing in Oman it is necessary to add some mention of the system of suc cession to the Imamate. It is one of the cardinal principles of the Ibadhi sect that their spiritual leader should be elected in every case. Prior to 1783 Imams, including the first of the line of the A1 bu Said were appointed by election, the persons elected being per sons possessing outstanding religious attributes. From 1784, when the Imamate ceased to exist, its recreation in 1913, succession remained hereditary with the administrative functions of the post carried out by persons having no particular religious qualifications -and governing under the secular title of •’Saiyid' 1 or n Sv&lt;ltan w . The Sultan seems to have realised that his general acceptance in Oman . would be influenced by his religious qualifications for he has now abolished all secular courts in Muscat and Matrah and established the Shara law as the only recognised law for his subjects. His de votions are most rigorous and correct and unlike his father, he neither drinks nor smokes. The question of the prohibition of liquor and tobacco is known to be occupying his mind, perhaps lor the added reason that this subject formed one of the objections to Saiyid Faisal's regime voiced by Shaikh Isa at the peace negotiations of 1919. That in the early stages at any rate, the stability of his position in the interior would rest as much if not more, on moral or religious force, than on material force, he is doubtless fully aware. By this I do not mean that the Sultan’s aim is that he should succeed to the Imamate for this is certainly not the case. His object is the abolition of the Imamate and the substitution of his own rule backed by force for the ineffective authority of the Imam. 6. ' The Sultan’s statement of his aims must I think be received with considerable sympathy for although the unfortunate events lead- ^ ing to the virtual independence of Omen in 1920 have been represented in the past in a light very unfavourable to the A1 bu Said, the more fundamental reason which united the interior against the Sultanate was perhaps lost sight of. The use of force majeure to suppress arms traffic in Muscat and to abolish the right of the Sultan to import and sell arms was probably the biggest single factor which enabled the differences betv/een the Hinawis and Ghafiris to be dis solved in this common purpose of opposing the Sultan. There is no doubt that the consolidation of Oman under a single ruler could bring inestimable benefits to the State. The present Sultan is one of the most capable Arab rulers of his time? h* is young, well educated, has broadened his vision by extensive travel, possesses strength of character, is supremely shrewd, and enjoys a high degree of natural prestige Given the opportunity he could, in my opinion, he capable of holding his own amongst any of the tribal leaders and by the saga cious handling of the tribes, might bring an era of enlightenment to the people whose self-imposed isolation has precluded all advance. As an instance of his capabilities may be cited the case of the pro vince/-province of Dhofar. Hhen he first visited Dhofar shortly after his accession, disorder was rife and this authority of his Government did not extend much beyond the coastal strip between Raisut and Merbat. Now his effective influence covers the entire inhabited coastal and hill areas from Ras Shuwamiyah to the borders of the Aden Protecto rate. The Shaikhs of the Qara and Kathir recognise Ms authority and are regular visitors to his palace when he. is there, and to his Wall in his absence. 7. I do not imagine that, the Sultan's idea of British Forces es tablishing him as de facto Ruler of Oman (and probably having tomain- tafn him in that position) is one that would commend itself to either His Majesty's Government or to the Government of India - unless stra tegic considerations of the future are considered as requiring further e:camination of the proposal for a protectorate first raa.de in 1890. Assuming that no such radical change in our attitude of non-interference with the interior can be contemplated, it would, I suggest, be unwise for us to associate ourselves directly with the Sultan's aims and thereby incur responsibilities which we are not prepared to carry out to the full. Our general policy should, I submit, continue to be one of strengthening the authority of the Sultan while making it clear that the extension of his influence must be at his responsibility and achieved by his own exertions. My own view is that the attitude of the Ghafiri Shaikh is one more example of the Arab’s eye being 'fixed unflinklngly in the main change'. The healthy condition of the State Treasury is already beginning to exert a strong centripetal force, against which the Imam lias no effective counter measure, and given the necessary materials to discourage Hinawi opposition, the Sultan would probably have little difficulty in re-establishing himself. By action on his own initiative and without direct support from outside, he would not only enhance his own reputation amongst the tribes, but would also be forced to base his actions on the more stable foundation of consent. 8. In persuance of this policy I would suggest that the Sultai^ be given facilities for acquiring additional arms and equipment in reason able quantities. At the end of the war large stocks of surplus mili tary stores will presumably become available and it might then be pos sible tc make a presentation to him of a number of small field guns with ammunition and perhaps mortars. This suggestion will form the subject of a separate reference linked to the facilities he has given to us during the war. 9. In any developments towards Oman, the position of the British Adviser, if one is appointed, would I think remain unaffected as he would presumably occupy himself principally with relations with the Agency and the administrative affairs of the coastal area. So far as the Levies are concerned, it seems desirable that when our war time res ponsibilities for internal security end, the State should be encouraged to depend less on our assistance is the administration and command of Its military force. In bis half-brother, Saiyid Tariq, the Sultan has a man who has just returned from extensive training with the Zhob Militia and the Chagai Levy Corps and whose services could probably be most suitably utilised in this sphere. 10. It is relevant to observe in conclusion that if the advice tendered to the Sultan is unfavourable to his aims, he is likely to be come a despondent and disinterested Ruler and to retire finally to Dho far - with unfortunate, if not serious, consequence to the State. 11. I shall he glad to receive your instructions in due course. |e Political Agent, Muscat© SECRET D.O.

Reference correspondence resting with your letter N 0 . 84 -S, dated the 15th January, 1946. 2. His Highness has now received invitations from Shaikhs Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu All and Sulaiman bin Eamiyar of the Beni Riyam to visit them at their headquarters at Jaalan and the Jebel Akhdhar. The first of these invitations the Sultan has accepted, and has decided to make the journey to Jaalan in the first week of April. This is the first time that His Highness has been able to regard his relations with Shaikh Ali as suffi ciently satisfactory- to permit his presence amongst the Beni Bu Ali and he is, therefore, anxious to make full use of his present advantage,regarding the successful outcome of his visit as a mat ter of the highest importance to himself and his Government. 3- The particular significance of this development would appear to provide a suitable moment for indicating to this power ful tribe and to the assembly of Jeneba Shaikhs and their retinues who will also be present that the consolidation of the Sultan's authority in this area has our fullest support. If you agree with this view I would suggest for your consideration that a de monstration by Royal Air Force aircraft over Jaalan during the Sultan's visit might be the best way of making our attitude clear. Ras al Hadd aerodrome which is in close proximity to Jaalan would provide a convenient base for such an operation. 4- As regards the second invitation for him to visit the Beni Riyam, His Highness has wisely judged that the moment for him to venture into Oman has not yet come and has informed Shaikh Sulaiman of his inability to accept. In course of conversation, however, he suggested to me that I might like to visit the Jebel Akhdhar and mentioned the possibility of Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur accompanying me. Provided satisfactory negotiations are concluded for a com bined visit, I can see no strong objection to his suggestion, but will consider the matter further when the time comes for more de finite {Signature) {Designationdefinite arrangements to be made. I may mention here that during his recent stay at Muscat, Shaikh Sulaiman expressed more than once, the hope that I would be able to visit him at Nakhl. Political Agent, Muscat.

Sultan was informed in writing as instructed. At sulsequent interview he stated that he was grateful to His Majesty’s Government for assistance promised but was disappointed that no reference was made to use of Royal Air Force. Air support at any critical stage he regarded as sine qua non to his undertaking operations in Oman for reasons that (1) he could not ignore possibility of combined opposition from a few of the more powerful tribes( especially from Sharqiyah ) proving too strong for his forces (2) he could not feel justified in investing large propor tion of his financial resources in consolidation of his authority unless success was assured and (3) that his resources would not permit long drawn out struggle. He requested specific statement from His Majesty’s Government o# this point adding that if this was unfavourable he would not proceed further with his plans. 3. Sultan also requested that if use of Royal Air Force in emergent circumstances was agree^to he should be given assurance that ( a) as rifles and ammunition which His Majesty’s Government had agreed to supply him would be required for his irregular forces, any reasonable additional needs of Levies for purpose in view would be supplied separately; and (b) that in the event of operations proving more difficult that* he anticipated farther supplies of ammunition for irregular forces would be immediately available. I consider this request reasonable. 4. I strongly urge favourable consideration of Sultan's request for assistance by Royal Air Force. His reasons for this areare cogent and he can be relied on to do everything possible to avoid situation arising which would necessitate air action. To avoid general unrest throughout Oman, suppression of any strong opposition in shortest time is in my view essential. Only method of ensuring this is availability of air-support. POLITICAL35/112.

Position is that until assurance of direct support by Royal Air Force is given Sultan does not propose to prepare detailed plans in consultation with his Military Adviser. It can however be stated that (a) he will not substantially increase his regular forces and (b) that his plans will include operations by friendly tribesmen who will require rifles and arnnunition. It is therefore impessitle to be precise at this stage but I consider that additional requirements of rifles for Levies are not likely to exceed 200. 3. Reference para 3 of your telegram. I do not think that it was the Political Resident's intention to restrict supplies of rifles and ammunition to Muscat Levies only. Mortars and machine guns would ofcourse be for Levies. It has all along been clear that Sultan will need both regular and irregular forces to achieve his aims if only for the reason that dependence on regular troops only v/ould demand a force which it would he beyond resources of State to maintain. 4. I wo' Id suggest that consideration of these points might be postponed until question of use of Royal ^ir Force is decided and Sultan has given us detailed idea of his plans based on military advice. 1 Political1 Telegram.

Precedent exists in air assistance afforded at SUR in 1932 (vide Government of India telegram No.546 ( fop. i T.la Sv 4 / February 13th 1932 and connected correspondence). 2. Royal Air Force have made extensive use of Sultan*s territories in past years (sometinec to his embarrassment) and it is in their interest that he should maintain his control. Moreover fact that Sultan has made specific request (which could if considered desirable be obtained from him in writing) for such assistance would answer any accusation of interference In sovereignty of an independent State. Should such assistance be denied and Sultan be forced to givo up his plans it will embitter hi®, destroy our good relations over many years with him, and render difficult the obtaining of any facilities we may require in the future. - 1411011 - Persian Gulf Residency, Bushirc, the 3rd May 1946.

They are however averse in principle from use of threat cf force in independent state even at ruler's request since this might well lead to blood shed and would almost certainly give rise to criticism and misinterpretation in interested quarters. It might even lead to His Majesty's Government being arraigned before the Security Council of the United Nations. Mere demonstrations by flying over would not be sufficient unless it were accompanied by demand (eg. by dropping leaflets) for sub mission of tribesmen to Sultan's authority. To be effective such demand y/ould have to be backed by the threat of air action in the event of refusal to comply. 2.

While it is possible that plan proposed by Sultan wouihd be (nut) est way of effectingeffecting this, it might, since its timing is dependent on the ? death of the Imam involve in fact considerable delay* It has bfeen suggested here that as a means of securing earlier access for Oil Company suitable financial inducements in Sultans name might succeed in securing co-operation of tribal chiefs. It might be possible for Oil Company to supply the necessary funds. Such a plan of peaceful penetration might even be an alternative to Sultan’s programme of proceeding by force but in any case might be of use for limited purpose a m of securing early access for Oil Compeny to those ares in which they are interested.

Following is plan that has been suggested, A small and well equipped expedition, to be led by a British Politio&amp;l Offioer, and to include technical oil experts, (with suitable armed escort ^ provided by the Sultan) should be despatched to gain contact with « the leading Sheikhs in selected areas. It would be the task of the leader of the expedition to explain to them the Sultan’s intention to press forward with the economic development of the country by the exploitation of potential oil resources and to impress on the local Sheikhs the advantages they would obtain from co-operating in this policy. 3. As proof of the Sultan’s good intentions, this representative would take with him and distribute to the tribal leaders gifts calculated to make the greatest appeal to the recipients and would promise that more would be forthcoming if the tribesmen agreed to co-operate. The expedition, being small could probably not carry many gifts in kind and the first payments would no doubt have to be made largely in cash.

J.F. Farrell Major G.S.L. Jacobs Colonel Carter ) Hr# F.A.K. Harrison ) (India Office) In the Chair Air Ministry Foreign Office Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power Mar Office India Office 1. The Chairman said that the main question which had to be considered was whether the advantages of lending the Sultan the assistance of the R.A.F. to enable him to establish his authority in the interior outweighed the disadvantages of possible embarrassing publicity# The timing of the Sultan’s projected operations for the re-establishment of his authority v/as dependent on the death of the Imam, which might occur at any time, though when was quite uncertain. 2. Mr# Hikolcy said that the Foreign Secretary v/as opposed to the use of the R.'.F. for operations against recalcitrant tribesmen. It was agreed that demonstration flights by themselves, without a clearly defined objective wh5 v - the R.A.F. would have the authority to take effective action to encure by force, were not a practical proposition. 3. Major Jacobs said that the Y'ar Office shared the Foreign Office’s misgivings. Mr. Farrell said that the Ministry of Fuel and Power regarded it as a matter of urgency to press on with the development of new oil resources in the Middle East, and that there were particular advantages in development by a British oil company such as P.C.L., in which there was American participation. From the strategic aspect Muscat wag v/trll-prlaced, Better scr than L'ov/uit or South Persia. The M.F.P, felt that it was desirable to give P.C.L. the fullest possible support in the development of Muscat’s oil resources. If they could achieve nothing the Company might be inclined to give up their concession. The suggestion was made that it might be v/orth while asking the Joint Administrative Planning Staff for an opinion on the strategic value of Muscat oil, but it v/as felt by the meeting that the information which could be provided at this stage about the oil resources of Muscat were not sufficient to elicit a useful appreciation 5. On the question of oil development the meeting discussed the possibility of a direct approach being made to the Imam and local Sheikhs by the oil company. The main objection to such an independent &lt; /approachapproach was, as r.ientionod by the Political Resident in his c cyra./t ho*']. -02 of 27th May, that it v/ould prejudice the eventual success 01 the Sultan’s plans. In general, it was essential to work through the Sultan* iir.? . '■i-'-elcy suggested that a possible way for the Sultan to c.,uond his influence into the interior, thereby facilitating oil developr.iont, v/ould be by the judicious distribution of gifts, either °“ 1 0r goods, t° influential chiefs. Money for this purpose r.nggt ' DG Provided either by the Oil Conpany, or if they were umdlling by , if the Treasury were willing to agree. It v/as agrci. 1 that this suggestion wight be put to the Political Resident, 7 * Ik&gt;. Farrell suggested that the R.A.F. Light be able to help the Oil Conpany to carry out an aerial survey, Mr* Johnston said - L ° :C , could probably not undertake such a cor.unitncnt if it ’v/ere at all extensive. It v/as agreed, however, that it would be worth while asking the Conpany whether assistance from the R.A.F* would'be of any use to then, if they had not their own aircraft for the purpose, 8. The c onclusions of the neeting were as follows: (a) The reasons in favour of prorising the Sultan R.A.F. assistance at this stage, when the date of the Inaris death could not be foretold, were not solidly enough grounded to outweigh the disadvantages. (d./ ouch assistance however as v/as possible should be given to the Oil Conpany to carry out a survey of the interior in order to assess the oil prospects of Onan, and they right be asked whether the R.A.,:. could give then any useful assistance in this direction. The possibility of providing the Sultan with noney for gifts to distribute local chiefs right also be considered in this connection 9* The India Office undertook to discuss the natter in general terns with representatives of P.C.L., whon they wore seeing, and to circulate, ior the concurrence of the departnents represented at the neeting, a draft telegran to the Political Resident.'Telegram From Q Political Resident, Bahrain.

Essential point In Sultan*s aims is that he wishes first to establish his authority, and later to permit controlled exploitation of natural resoiirces. His Majesty’s Government’s proposals which are confined to ways and means of giving oil company access tc Oman, will certainly cause acute disappointment, and I find it difficult to estimate effect this will have on Sultan. 3 . Corresponaenco on this subject shows that Sultan is fully cognisant of advantage of securing co-operation of tribal chiefs by financial inducements, but tlist^ he has not succeeded in persuading them to abandon their allegiance to Imam, his decision to take no action urtjl the death of the Imam is sound, and wisdom of advising him to act now is very questionable. In recent times the main reas n for Sultan’s inability to negotiate for access of oil and locust parties tc interior, has been his desire to avoid recognising the authority of Imam, rather than to lack of funds. 4 . it is essential that we should work through the Sultan if a crisis in our political relations with nim is to be avoided. Intensification of efforts at peaceful infiltration would meet with greater approval from Sultan, if this were to be ^ carried out by his government. This desideratum could perhaps be met if proposed paity were led by Sultan’s British Adviser, assisted if necessary by oil company technicians. 5 . I feel it most desirable that the initiative in this matter should come, as far as possible, from the Sultan. I therefore suggest thet the next step might he exploratory talks, during which he 7 »xuld be informed of His Majesty’s Government’s decision against direct assistance, and at which his Majesty'suamm Government * s deair© to help him in f ,,, iV-&lt;nc5fvi find other Treys would be communicated to him* These tal^s ere Ifkelj 7, to he of a d©licat6_^. nature, vide paragraph 10 of my express l -tter Ho* S* 1126* dated August 19th* 1945. and the Political Resident’s telegram No. 682* . 4 4 dated Itay 3rd. 1946.

(camp) Bahrain, the 19th July, 1946. Dear hallows. Please refer to India Office Express Letter No.4513/46 dated the 8th July, 1946. I asked Lermitte to come and see me yesterday in order 2 . to ascertain his Company's first objective in Muscat territory. He replied that what his Company v/anted to do was to start from Ras al Khaimah and Operate south to Baraimi and on from there to Dhank and Ibri. From Ibri they wanted to get through to the coast via T »7adi Kowasinah. They also wished to cover all the country on both sides of the main range north of the Wadi Hov/asinah. He further explained that his Company had not put forward any programme of exploration in the Baraimi area for the next cold weather because it was linked up with exploration in Muscat territory and the Sultan had refused tb/em access to the country they most wanted to visit. It will be noted that the whole of the area mentioned by Lermitte is included in the area which the Sultan was willing to allow the Company to explore in 193S vide the Sultan's letter to Longrigg of August 1938, copy sent to Muscat under India Office Printed Letter No.P.Z.6077/1938 dated the 30th August 1938. 3. Lermitte further remarked that during the visit to Baraimi last cold weather he ascertained that the tribes in the Ibri area refused to acknowledge the authority of the Sultan over them and were ready to deal with the Company direct. 4* The contents of this letter may help you to a certain extent in formulating your views on the India Office Express Letter under reference 5.

From the Sultan's refusal to allow the company to operate in the area Baralml f Shank, and Wadi Hawaslnah, it is clear that the influence he possessed there in 1938 has greatly diminished, and in some places disappeared.

At first aight I must confess that I feel myself soiaewhat doubtful about the success of the proposed scheme even if the Sultan were to accept it. It must be remembered that tne majority of the tribes of the interior owe no allegiance of any kind to the Sultan and at present show little or no desire to come under his sway. I feel that if the expedition were to set out as proposed accompanied by an armed escort provided by the Sultan some kind of clash would be inevitable unless the ground had been long and carefully prepared before-hand* which is not the oase. 3. With regard to paragraph 4 of the ifixpresa letter under reference so far as I know the 'want M is already there and some ~ if not all of the tribes are anxious for any oil deposits in ^ their country to be exploited. They want however to reap the full benefits of such exploitation themselves and not to share them with the Sultan• Lermitte reports that when he visited Baraimi last year some tribesmen from Ibri definitely invited him to explore their country. It would therefore I think be comparatively easy to enter into direct relations with the tribes. This however would have a diaaetrous effect on the dultan and would probably result either in his abdication or in his retirement to Dhofar and neglect of the affaire of his State. Hie one ambition is to obtain control of the interior but he can do very little towards this until the Imam dies. Meanwhile he is unwilling to negotiate with the tribes of the interior for the access for oil or locust parties as this cannot be done without recognising the authority of the Imam which he is andeaveering to undermine. If we deal direct with the tribes now we shall certainly prejudice the Sultan*s ohancee of obtaining control over them after the Imam's death. 4. The problem is a difficult one. *e want the oil urgently and the tribes are probably willing to let us have it if we find it provided we deal with them direct.

The Sultan still hopes however that when the Imam dies the tribes of the interior will ask him to rule over them. In reply to a question of mine he stated that he could almost certainly secure election as Imam but that he did not wish this as it would mean the continuance of an elective Imamate. He wishes to abolish the Imamate altogether end incorporate Omem in Muscat State. c 5.

He pointed out that Ibri was directly under the Imam's control - i t is actually the headquarters of one of his Walls - and expressed some doubt whether the tribesmen who had invited Lennitte to visit their country (vide paragraph 3 of my express Letter No. C/525 of 24th July) did so with the Imam's concurrence.

This individual does not belong to Dhofar province, nor has he any blood feud with any tribe of Dhofar. He belongs to Hadhramoat area, and came to Dhofar in 1933 as a refugee, and was permitted to stay there upto this day. He was involved in certain warlike trouble while he was staying with the Hamoomi tribe in Hadhramoat, and subsequently fled away. He is no shaikh. He had an idea that Hamoomi tribe would fight a certain place of Qaiti, and if they succeeded they would make him as a ’’father of the tribe / which seems absurd. However we saw him and warned^against any mischief on his part in Hadhramoat if he desires to continue living in peace at Dhofar.

On the 10th May, 1948, Mr. Bird of P.C.L. informed me that he had come to tfluscat to speak to his Highness ahout the following points (a) to report on his expedition to the interior (b) to request His Highness to open the Wadi GEZZI (c) to consider the possibility of getting Geologist to the HUQF area. On (a) Mr Bird told His Highness that he had given Es. 15,000 to the AL BU SHAMIS and taken a letter from them ac^pc agreeing to let P.C.L explore for a period of 3 years with a possible 2 years more. He had also paid rs. 3000 to the BU KHURIBAN and received a similar letter. The Sultan said that he considered that the amounts should be paid through him and not privately by the Company, that the exploratory party should Have entered BURAIMI via the FATIWAH jsx. provided with a guide by Hid Highness. fdr. Bird replied that he could not agree, and that if the Sultan tried to act as the authority ruling that area, ( where in point of fact, the authority of H.H. was admitted to be almost non-existent ), the tribes of the AL BU SHAMIS and others would sheer off and no progress would be made.

You will see that the note contains information, in 2 most cases of a very scanty nature, about tribes beyond the limits of Trucial Oman and nominally within the limits of the Sultanate of Muscat ard Oman. Our information about the Oman tribes is very incomplete 3 and out-ef-date. Most of it is to be found in Lorimer and in Miles* 'The Countries and Tribes of the Persian Gulf”. I suggest therefore that if you can find the time you should start compiling a note on the tribes of Oman proper. It is unlikely that you will be able to collect all the material yeu required- during your tenure of the Muscat appointment and the work will probably have to be completed by your successor. 4. It is important that the note should show the attitude of the tribes towards the Sultan and the extent to which they are already under his influence or likely to be willing to come under his w rule. wKqfb.

I agree that the present information is rather scanty and is nearly all ot it based on the work of Col. Miles in the 70 f s of last century. 3. Two main difficulties arise in connection with any new tribal list to be compiled. These are (a) the fact that a considerable amount of our previous infbrmation is out of date ( e.g. names of Shaikhs, relations with other tribes and with the Sultan himself; and we shall be dependent on fairly unreliable sources for future material. the fact that those who compiled our maps in the past paid rather scant attention to accurate transliteration of the Arabic names of places and peoples, so much so, that in some cases, it isVaxtawmCly impossible to be sure that a place marked on the map is, in fact, the same place as that referred to in the various books. 4. In order to avoid long and rather meaningless lists of tribes and place names, many of which are almost unheard of, I am co-relating my notes to a series of 29 Government of India 1/4”-1 mile lithographed maps which I took over from Stewart. Tribal settle ments and areas will be shown with, I hope, a fairly accurate latitude and longitude. ^'hese are extremely useful and cover the whole Sultanate an^Trucial Coast wit? the exception of a few gaps along the Arabian sea coast. They are, however, getting somewhat fragile owing to age and climate. If possible, I should like to receive reprints, which the External Affairs Department of the Government of India might even now be able to supply. I regret that they bear no reference His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.The Sultan complained on the 6th July that Shaikh Rashid of Ajman was trying to establish a claim to Masfut and to undermine the authority of Shaikn S&amp;vir bin Sultan of the Naira.

On the 25th of July this old rogue came to see me. He had come to Muscat with Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim. He was obviously running short of cash by that time and was aware that the Consulate was always good for a small M touch H . 2. He told me that Saiyid Ahmads mission had been mostly successful and added that tribes in that area were looking forward to the exploit ation of oil, for M with oil will come the representatives of the British Government who will bring peace, justice etc., etc., He was, however simply trying to tell me what he thought to believe, in the hopes of largesse for which he asked quite unashamedly. He was given Rs. 50/- from the Mission Funds lest H.I^.G should be thought mean ! I believe he tries this one with all P.A.‘s in succession — generally succeeds t ltd. F.D.S. 13/8gjCft. Persian Gulf Rasidency, Bahrain. 6th Daeoaber, 1948. Sir I have the honour to report that during my recent visit to Muscat, I asked the Sultan whether he was still planning to extend his influence over the whole of Oaan and whether he was likely to ask for any assistance from His Majesty's Government in doing so. It will be recollected that in 1946, when the Imam's early death was expected, it was agreed that His Majesty's Government should supply the Sultan with a certain amount of arms and ammunition at 60 f of their ordinary price, assist him in obtaining auxiliary supplies such as tentage, transport and medical and signalling equipment and make available for his forces on the normal deputation terms, a second British officer, and several Indian officers and non-commissioned officers. The Sultan, however, pressed for an undertaking that the Royal Air Force would give him direct support if his efforts to obtain control over the interior met with armed resistance. His Majesty's Government found it impossible to give such an under taking and the Sultan, when he was informed accordingly, on the 16th September 1946, said he must as a result abandon the plans which he had made, vide my express letter to the India Office. No. C/828 of the 16th September, 1946. On the present occasion, I reminded the Sultan that it was Impossible for him to hope for any active assistance from the Royal Air Force, and he said that he fully realised this. He went on to say that he expected that when the Imam died, the tribes would of their own accord ask him to rule over them as they were all feeling the economic pressure and were anxious to obtain the benefits from oil which they saw so many other Arabs enjoying and realised that they could make no progress in this direction with out his assistance and guidance. If, when the time came, he required any assistance from His Majesty's Government, such as that which had previously been promised, he would certainly apply for 3. Meanwhile he has not been idle, though such action as he has taken has been to some extent forced on him by the acti vities of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited in and beyond the Buralml area. I enclose extracts from a letter received from Mr. Bird, a previous member of the Indian Political Service who at one time acted as Political Agent at Muscat, and is now emplo yed by the dompany. It will be seen from this that a considerable amount has been accomplished, though Shaikh Saqr bln Sultan the leading Ka'lm Shaikh of Buraiml has not yet come in to see the Sultan. 4. 1 do not think that Mr. Bird is correct in saying that the Sultan has designs on the Imamate when the present Imam, Muhammad al Khalllli dies. His desire is that the elective Imamate should be abolished altogether and that the tribes should / accept The Rt. Hon.

Much of the correspondence discusses the Sultan's ambition to secure the allegiance of the Omani shaikhs and consolidate his authority in the interior of Oman. The correspondence recounts meetings between British representatives and the Sultan, in which the Sultan discusses his intentions to assert control in the Omani interior once the Imam of Oman has died, and requests British assistance in order to do so.In addition, the file contains extensive discussion regarding British policy in relation to the internal affairs of Oman. Matters covered include whether the Sultan should be supplied with arms, ammunition, and RAF assistance, and whether the British should approach the Omani tribes directly, in order to smooth the way for oil exploitation in the interior. Also covered are exchanges of correspondence and meetings between certain Omani shaikhs and the British representatives at Muscat.As well as correspondence, the file contains compiled notes on the principal shaikhs and tribes of Oman (ff 5-9), and notes on the tribes of Buraimi and Trucial Oman (ff 118-135, including details of tribes beyond the limits of Trucial Oman and within the limits of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman), the latter being described by the Political Resident as 'scanty'.The Arabic language material consists of several items of correspondence, of which English translations are included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000011#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
