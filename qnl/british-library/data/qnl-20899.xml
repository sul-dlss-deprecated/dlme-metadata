This dis-satis^ faction culminated in the form of a deputation addressing me, consisting of representatives of the houses of A1 Bassam, Al wusaibi, Al JTawwas, and by the Bahrain merchant, Mr. Yusuf Kanoo r.F, J informed the d-putatlon that 1 did not propose taking action uhlaes Bin Saud himself took the matter up. This was early in January laet. The actual nature of the com- plaint of the deputation was as follows That Shaikh Isa was imposing a fixed tax of *5^ ^ad volarem ) on all goods entering Bahrain whether from,India or elsewhere, which were consigned to Hassa and lejd, putting such goods on a par with those entering Bahrain Islands. That up to 19 17 Shaikh Isa had been accustomed to impose this 5^ tax only on goods which cleared the Customs louse and found their way into Bahrain itself. That he used to impose a gf ^ ad volarem tax(2) V on goods eonslgn«d and destined for the uainland,such goods never leaving th# 0U8to»e M oub # shede but 'being re-ehipped on firet opportunity on native craft. This 2i ^ tax was in addition to the Ardhiya or ground rent tax charged on all goods lying in the Cuetome Warehouses. That in 19 17, on the protest that the war had greatly reduced his customs receipts,Shaikh Isa Buddetdy imposed the full tax of i ^ on all goods landed at the Customs Pier, xThether such were entering Bahrain or were merely 'being transhipped froas B.I.gteamers to Jative Craft. That this tax was etill in foro®. That iejd, Kaesa and Qatif merchants consider ed it to be a grossly unfair tax and founded on no precedent and prayed for its removal It appears also that various similar complaints were made to the Agency in my predecessor's time, but nothing came of them, since Bin Saud was too closely engaged, putting his own house in order, not to mention his troubles with the fihareef lusain.^ And so the matter was dropped^/c uj?- Bin Saud, it would appear, has now definitely taken up the matter himself, and quite recently wrote to Shaikh Isa (in letter dated 18th January, 1920), asking him in a friendly way hie reasons for charging «ejd Merchants 5 ^ on 'TRAISHIP' goods, putting such goods on a par with those entering Bahrain. Bin Saud, further, requested that for old friendship's sake, the tax be again reduced to 2$ $ as formerly existing. To this letter Shaikh Isa returned no lattrrr, but later, hearing I was leaving for Massa, asked me to sound Bin Saud on the subject. Me # , at the same time, gave me his own reasons for having imposed the tax#5# I proceeded to fiaesa on S9th January, and whilst tbtre raised the question at issue with Bin Saud. Bin Saud expressed hinself in strong language at the way his subjects had been treated by the Shaikh of Bahrain of late years, and stated that friendly endeavours to get £haikh Isa to behare decently towards his people had failed entirely.le therefore, now, formally demanded that lie Uajesty^ Government should decide the present point of difference betY ?een hiuself and Shaikh lea. Shaikh Isa had certainly been like a father to him in the past, and rather than start a wordy warfare with him, he preferred to put this case before lis Majesty^ GovernEent, and get the natters settled once and for all. le merely deaianded that Sustome Regulations as understood in civilized countries be enforced in Bahrain. Me understood no Customs Tariff was ever imposed throughout the world on 'TRAISMIP' goods,i.e. those which never left the Customs louse, but were re-exported without entering the country where landed. Bin Saud, then, formally presented me with his letter 'A'Mcopy attached); this was on 7th February,1980. At the same time he requested me to forward it to ligher Authority with the request that early orders might be passed on same. 4. I give below, for the sake of clearness, both Shaikh Bin Baud's and Shaikh Isa^ points of view in the matter. * BIB SAUDIS CASE ( 1) le objects, as an act of injustice and contrary to all precedent, to Shaikh lea taking full Customs Duty on goods belonging to his subjects which are landed from ships on to Bahrain customs jetty but were destined for lassa or lejd^and not Bahrain. Sueh goode are never . taken out of the customs yard but remain lying there uiatil lative ©raft can be arranged to carry same to Ojair or Qatif (namely a week or fortnight). (2) le ©laims that Inter-national ©ustom should decide the matter. (?) le, of course, has no objection to raise to his Bubj.ete being Bade to pay the full s f Tariff on goods(4) ■fjL * ^ ' Tt / *»^ur^ ~ ^ fti/S.j, MM be* t^Cc, that they may bring into Bahrain / and which ar® coneign- ed to that town. (4) The matter le one of common justice, and he him- belf i» no way hop«B to he benifited. It is merely e. question of his subjectB receiving i'air treatment. A lejdi bringing joode, for instance, from Bombay to Maea has to pay the following now a days i 1 5^ Import Tax at Bahrain. Ardhiyah in Bahrain, which amounts to about Sj- 8^ second import tax at Ojair. Thus IJio subjects pay V5fi tax on all cowoditiee before . they finally gdt their goods into iejd territories^ (5) Me conteiade that the Bahrain Tariff should only be leried if the goods pass through the Customs into the town. (6) Shaikh Isa's argument that he (Bin Saud) has no right to charge 8% Import Tax at Ojair or Qatif, is no argument, le. Bin £aud, would never dream of taxing cargo landed at Ojair or Qatif whose eventual deetina- was, say, ftatar. The Turks used to charge a 3D ^ Import Tax pre viously to his taking over Maeea. Me has already re duced this to 8^. le hopes still further to reduce the tax when his finances are in better condition, lis is a new State just coming out of the Sryeilie of f ignorance, poverty and disorder, le is struggling to put hts house in order and is compelled, for the present, to charge a high import tarif. EHAIK1 ISA 1 £ EASE. ( l) le admits in the past to having charged on all goods coming into Bahrai^and on goods passing through (tranship) Bahrain for lejd and other places. i (2) In 19 16 he found that owing to war restrictions and poor trade generally, his ©ustosis Revenues were goind down. This, added to the general increase in theIW?' V: -''i \ £ ^ (M \ ooet of living,rade it naceesary to do something, if« ordarecl fVll ©uetome Duty to 'be charged on all - t £ c goods landed on hie pier, whether eonsigned to Mainland1 Or not. 6^cl4^ fyrmi-v Ifce •ct# ^ 'Uu*^k^4 tsi'^ (m^\ (5) Be oonsidere It 1b hie right to charge what Sue- ' lone Duty he likee provided he does not exceed S% duty, as fixed by treaty with His liajegty'B Government (When asked to quote number and date of treaty, he referred to article 4 of Treaty lo. 5, page 6 of Treaties and undertakings in force 'between Mis Majesty^ Govermnent and Rulersof Bahrain (copy attached). (4) Me complains that Bin £aud charges 8^ CustomB on i his subjects when taking goods in to Ojair and Qatif, and that,therefore. Bin Saud has no right to complain, If his own subjects hare to pay full duty on goods using Bahrain ©ustome House as a store godown, even if such goods did not enter the town* (g) If he went back to the e£ f. rule, as in force prior to 39 IB, he feared his revenues would be enor- KOusly reduced and he could not afford such loss. S. iaving conversed fully on the subject with both Ehaiki ^sa and Bin Saud, I a* of opinion that Shaikh lea is in the wrong for the following reasops (l) The treaty which he quotes has nothing to do with the case and refers to British subjects only. (8) CustOEs Department, I believe, all over the world, do not charge Inport Tax on goods until sueh goods are actually passed through the S ub tome Kouss of the land to which the^ are consigned. 1 Further, his cocplaint that his Customs receipts iJOt be greatly reduced if he foregoes the newly imposed tax,nay be quite true, but if he were a decent ruler and made any attempt at all to rule properly,' he would know that he eould raise reve nues by such legitimate meane ae j- (a) numbering and taxing hie Bative Sailing Craft. (b) Taxing pearling boats. (o) Selling some of his innumerable gardene to the inhabi- tantg(«) and so Introducing a rs^ular Date lax. t (d) ir: el ling arable land for wheat and tearley purDoees and eo introducing a Regular tand Revemae. (e) Farrdngr the fisheries. (f) Sheep and camel tax. »©t to Mention the various Municipal Taxes which every wunicipal ity has a right to levy. An it is , none of the above sources of revenue are tapped|l nor does Land, Date or Municipal Revenue exist even in nane, and this is fey reason of the suicidal policy of the Ehailch who has forbidden any land to be owned by any one but himself. Result i The island remains a dreadfully badly managed and rapidly decaying private Estate with no revenues v accruing from it at all. There remain? the ,, §u8toms' , . Practi cally the wbols of ^hailth ^sa's income is obtained from this source. Yet here again, he appears utterly incapable of putting even his own Customs louse in order. I eetinnate that his customs roughly should b^ing in 15 to 20 Lakhs of rupees per annum. It actually brings in from 7 to 10 Lakhs. The scandalously managed Syndicate which runs the customs must be held responsible for the defieieney. 1,further, recommend the quashing of this incipient trouble at once, before it is alloved to grow bigger and give us endless trouble, ^in baud, now a days, imagines he ie sur rounded by enemies, all trying to fleece him in some way or other his attitude is rather that of a lionsss robbed of her cubs. From bent v what I saw'of him lately he assms on getting what he calls Justice done to his subjects. Should he fail to get this present coaplaint attended to, it will only make him more bitter, than he is already Me will only retaliate by putting an embargo on shee sheep, ghi and dates, and the stupid and short-sighted policy CTf :haikh lea will only come back to hie own head, ^or can ^is Majesty♦e'Government afford to see '•-in ^aud starting a quarrel with the ^uler of Bahrain, his eastern neighbour.

After eompllments, I informed your honour of th# GOBununieation of the respected Shaikh Isa regarding ©ustons duties. It is true I had written to hi* as he expects me to do so in certain eases urging that I shall refer (Eirectly to him and then he would settle EDatters between U8» As he is like my father and as I had promised to make direct •oamunioation of this sort to him, I addressed him on this subject. Uy original intention was to inform yoj. of the matter later. At the time of writing to Shaikh Isa I also wrote to you a letter through Abdul Aziz ftusaibi, directing him to inform your honour of the result of my S om- aunication to Shaikh lea. Sow,thank God, the desired object 'ill be gained, as you will he the medium in the matter. My complaint against Shaikh Isa in that he has no right to charge duty on transhipment cargo whioh is landed at Bahrain and then re-ezported to my territoriee, namely, Ojair Qatif and Jubail, Ardhiyah (ground rent) alone being charged. But he has every right to charge duty on goods entering the town and sold in the town by my subjects like any other goods imported by Bahrain merchants for Bahrain. That Hie Excellency mentioned to your honour that I have been ■arging duty on the goods of his subjects who imported mer chandise into my territories, and of course nothing enters K y territories which is not sold in them and, therefore, I hare every right to charge them duty Just as Mis Excellency is entitled to charge duty on goods imported into hie territory and sold in it by my subjecte; but what is brought on my shores for transhipment. I have no right absolute ly to charge any duty, except the ground rent. If Mis Excel- Lncy bases hie argument on the days of the Turks,these people were unjust to their subjects and to the people in general.i (li) i*4 7 As regards nyself, no arrangement has taken place between Shaikh Isa and myself regarding anything and the duty charged on goo( of my Bubjecte ie mjust and contrary to the regulation© which I donot ooneent to and in like manner the Migh British Govern- iient will not like it, and your honour is my agent (to represent the matter) in accordance with current rules and regulations./'V Telegram- Code From Trevor (Political) Bushire, To Political Bahrain.

M ^ 65-® Political Agency, Bahrain. Dated the 6J:h March, 19^0. n To BIN bAUD. After compliments. f In answer to your letter dated 17th Jamadi al Awwal,*38 regarding the 5% customs duty which His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali Al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., G.S.I., Ruler of Bahrain takes from your merchants on tranship goods, and which Your Excellency'objects to as an unjust and unfair charge. I have forwarded your letter to Lieut.Colonel Wilson, Civil Commis sioner, Baghdad, with a copy to Lt.-Colonel Trevor at Bushire, with a strong recommendation that His Majesty^ Government taire up the matter and give a definite decision in the matter. In forwarding your letter, I pointed out in full report Shaikh Isa's alleged reasons for imposing this unjust tax, and your answers to Shaikh Isa. In fact I have made the matter entire ly clear to His Majesty's Government. It remains now to wait for an answer, which, when it comes, I trust, will be entirely satisfactory to lour Excellency. Regarding your statements to me while I was in Hasa,that you hope to develop the port of Ojair. I have Informed His about Majesty 1 s Government this and requested that if possible they should arrange with the B.I.Company to send a ship every now and then to Ojair direct. Your Excellency must understand that I cannot say at all whether Govt. w±skx&amp;B will be able to arrange this at present as steamers are very scarce these days, but I would like Your Excellency to know that your friend has not failed to represent your wishes to and higher authority. One thing you should realize fully.that A is that much hostility may be expected from the Ruler of Bahrain. This is natural, but in-sha-Allah the latter will be made to see the unfairness of not wishing to allow you aN port of your own. Regarding your future hopes of JUbail as a harbour This I have also notified to the High Government, as I pro mised I would. The first thing that should be done in the matter is for a proper survey to be made by Government of the channels leading from the open sea to the harbour itself. Before any big shipd can come there they must Xnow all about ^he depth of the water etc. I have, therefore, suggested to His Majesty^ Government that at an early date a ship be sent to Bfe chart the harbour and approaches to Jubail. Regarding your statement to me that you intend asking His Majesty's Government to take all your subjects resident in Bahrain under her control. My advice to you, if you in tend making this request, is to do so soon as the present moment is an auspicious one, for it is known to me that His Majesty^s Government is considering the question, as to what foreign subjects resident in Bahrain should come under Shaikh Isa^ authority and what under the protection of His Majesty's Government, that is, of the Political Agent. Hoping I may hear of your news shortly and wishing you long life and prosperity I remain. Yours etc. etc. Major, P.S. I have not had reply to your requests submitted through me to His Majesty's Government whilst I was at Hasa. In-sha- Allah one will come shortly.COHFIDKi^IAL no. 7Zb--fo to Political Agency, Bahrain. bated the Bth «laroii, 1920# '-he «puty Political Feel dent in the Persian Gulf, P U fc 1 H I H E# mm&amp;AUwu F- Reference your telegram Ko. 555 dated 10th -arch, 19 £0. tub^ect reduction of Custom duty on tranship' goc^p, Bahrain• According to your instruction given me in your above mentioned talegraa, I yesterday paid an official visit to Sh&amp;ifth lea and dircuseed the question on the line© suggested by you* Shaikh Hamad was present at the Interview, I was particularly careful to approach the matter in ae friendly a way a® possible and in repeating what you told cie I took the line that you were anxious to appear in the light of a friendly adviror. I emphasized the point that in caud was also a friend of ais Majeetyuovemment and had appealed to you to adjudicate the matter, iou wore bound to look at the question fro© t^e point oi view of a neutral, and any advice you gave wae of necereity etrictly impartial« Bin Caud, I etiid, had a grievance in that at almost every port in the world it wae cue toaary to take a cslniimam cue torn duty from tranehip goode, Buoli duty in placet like Basrah being 1 % only, and in Bombay I belleyed f From the very opening of tsy conversation, I could eee, rhaikh lea's mind wae made up,even though Shaikh Hamad did all ha could to persuade his father to adopt a reasonable attitude;shaikh lea, having let me eay all f had to aay, replied that on no condition, whateoever, woula he agree to reducing the present rate of 5 ^ to i merely in order to pleaee Bin fcaud. Bin taud might(2) make ae good a case as he pleased, 'but he (Shaikh Isa ) refused to be dictated to by another ruler in .the manage ment of his own affairs* Therefore it was useless to ask him to think of reducing his customs merely in order to effect a friendly settlement between him and Bin Saud. He went on to say that on the occasion when he last re duced his 'tranship* 1 customs,i.e. when Bin Saud took over Hassa^in 19 13, he had done so entirely of his own free will and because he wished to attract trade to Bahrain. He denied that he had been influenced by you in any way. Similarly, after he had accomplished his purpose he raised the rate to 5 ^ again, this also of his own free will and because it was his •haq 1 to do so. He, Shaikh Isa, would only consent to reducing his customs in favour of tranship goods on one condition, and that was if he received an official order to do so from you. In that event he would not only accept the order with alacrity ('Ala *Aini wa 'Ala Rasi) but, as he said, his tt sharaf M would still be un-impaired, for Bin Saud would not be able to 'crow* over him and say that he,Shaikh Isa, had reduced the customs because he was afraid of him. Buch an order would be one from Government, which no Arab Ruler could argue against, and which all would understand. In view of the above attitude I am of opinion that the soundest plan is for a letter to be written by you to Shaikh Isa which, if I might suggest it and 'ou approve, might take something of the following forir. You had heard that he, Shaikh Isa, had, during the war and without reference to the Political Agent, raised his Cus toms duty on tranship goods from 2$ % to 5 %, which was contrary to the arrangement come to between him and you in 19 15, and that this increase was neither just, nor in accord with general custom. Furthermore, that Bin Saud, also a friend of His Majesty's Government, had lodged a(?) formal complaint againet what tie described as an in justice to his subject® resident in li&amp;aea and Baixrain 3 and had appealed to you to adjudicate in the matter,, and that after due consideration your Judgement *a&amp; that Shaikh lea was in ttw wrong, and that he should again reduce the customs charges to 2l % on all good© except piece goode, which latter could continue to pay at the rate of If I*,/- per single bale ( according to Sh: lea he reduced this to W 4/~ in 19 1?), 2* Ae a sort of 'backhand' concession,however, I would euggeet that you add the following in your letter in order to strengthen the hands of the local Customs Authorities (a) That all goods for tne mainland landed at Bahrain must be addressed to the port of destination via Bahrain# (b) That no goods eo consigned will b© allow ed to be diverted into Bahrain without the Kuler or Political Agent*© sanction* (o) Vhat tranship good® will only be allowed to remain In the Customs lou^e for 20 days.After that they must be re-shipped to destination. \allure to remove within the time limit to entail payment of full duty of 5%. a direct order frees you on something of the above lines is the only way, I think, to get Shaikh laa to isove in the matter. He, now-a-days, unfortunately, ie entire ly in the hands of hie third son, fchalkh Abdullah, backed by the latter 1 s evil genius Jassim Al Chirawl ( he accom panied Shaikh Abdullah to Fnfland) Both the above»ever since their return, seam to Have ^hanged markedly for the ^orse - official records show that before seeing Home, Shaikh Abdullah was showing great promise. The contrary is, I f•'''-.r, the case now• The whole policy of Abdullah and Jassim, now-a-days, ie directed towards freeingtheTaeelvee fro^ British control• They reject all advice and are tirelepr in their efforts to get Shaikh lea to adopt a similar attitude. The wild talk of 'the rights of small nations' ifhich they imbibed at Home would appear to be at the bottom of all the trouble. In my opinion Jaoeim'p evil influence over Abdullah is doing a vary great deal of harm, eepacially ie it tending to estrange rhaifch Isa, and spoil the state of friendly feelinare which has existed between the Huler and auccsc- eive Political Agents in the past.

To ask him to take with one hand and give back with the other will in my opinion only tend to irritate and Shaikh of Bahrain will be more inclined to resent such order than consider we were trying to let him down gently.

After Compliraents, All is well here and there in nothing of importance to oonvey to your honour* as regards the question of Quatons (transit) dues l hiivs been awaiting a definite reply from you conveying the decision of the High Government, but have so fir not found any mention of it in your honour's letters. ±n these days, owing to serious lack of provisions, very large numbers of the inhabitants of Hejd, both Hadhar (town- dwellers) as well as Badia (noiaads), have gone down towards the ooast ports of the Persian Gulf for the purpose of trade. 1 trust therefore th^t you will again renind His Majesty's Government about the question of transit dues in order that an early settlement of this matter may be effected, and the needs of my subjects may be alleviated.

To The Political Agent, Bahrain, Memora.nduin . 9^ p JO / When your telegram dated 2lst May 138 was.,-received I sent to the Civil Commissioner a telegram no.1055 dated 22nd May a copy of which is attached, ' ' 2. In reply I have received a telegram no.6256 dated 24th May (copy attached) repeatjrfig the answer of the Government of India to his telegram no.4602 which had been overlooked. The Acting Civil Commissioner still anxious to raise the Tariff to some thing on the lines of the Persian Tariff, I have already sent you the main features of the recent increases in that. I Imow also that the recent Tariff Commission in Persia were of opinion that the only way to reduce smuggling in Persia would he to raise the Tariffs on the opposite side of the (fulf to approx imately the same figure - the idea, in theory, is a very good one. 3. .but in practice as we know the whole administration of Bahrain is so rotten that a simple proviso that some o.&lt; ohe money would have to be spent on harbour improvement would not be sufficient to safeguard traders against malversation of Customs receipts, 4. To begin with, no one would over know what were the actual receipts from Customs any more than twe do at present, and there would be nothing to prevent the Customs Syndicate irom showing the increase in receipts resulting from the new Tariff as quite trifling and spending a correspondingly trifling sum in harbour improvements.VJ i 5. I think it would be 'best to inform the Shaikh that H.M T s Government and the Government of India have in view the standardization (to some extent) of Tariffs round the G-ulf and with this end in view are considering the question of abrogating the Clause of the Treaty with Bahrain which fixed the Tariff at 5^ ad valorem and permitting an increase cor responding to the Persian Tariff: at the same time they see that his Customs is not properly organized and so they cannot make the change, if he would set his Customs House in order, borrowing if necessary a. Custom s official from India to do this and showed that his Customs House was in order keeping proper accounts etc, Government would agree to raising the Tariff, Do you think this would meet the case? 6. What are the commercial objections to raising the tariff which I think you once mentioned to me in conversation. 7. Referring to the telegram from the Government of India no.562-S dated 5th May quoted in Civil Commissioner's telegram no,6256? are you certain that the Shaikh of Bahrain would accepttorder to reduce his tariff on transit goods with alacrity? Do you think any arrangement with the Customs Syndicate and Bin Baud on the lines indicated feasible? Unless there is any early mail coming please telegraph your views on these lines. Col.

Objection on commercial grounds not stated but I should remark generally accepted Customs tariffs would have had to be increased, India and England have agreed to rise in Persia.

It has been brought to the notice of the Govt, of India that ^our Excellency is charging full customs duty on goods consigned to Nejd, Hassa, Qatif and Qatar. Government of India have directed me to write to lour Excellency and convey their orders which are that this practice is not in accordance with the existing international law, and to inform you, on behalf of Government, that in future you are to take only on goods consigned to the neighbourin^places on the mainland landed and reshipped at Bahrai^and that you are not to take any duty on goods which are transferred from ships to dhows straight off and which proceed direct to mainland ports. In any case it is understood that the goods^which the 2^ duty should be charged are those which are consigned to specified merchants residing on the mm mainland via Bahrain through their agents residing in Bahrain, such goods being reshipped from Bahrain to any of the ports on the Bin mainland within 20 days of the date of landing at Bahrain. Full duty will be charged on such goods if they remain in your island longer than the above -mentioned period (20 days). I hope these orders will be quite clear to your Excel lency that the Great powers are considering the question of a uniform customs duty on transhipment goods which arrive at a place and are re -exported to another place. It is possible that they may come to an agreement on the subject. The above orders do not prejudice any which the Oovern.ent may find it ^ to Your Kxcellancy when the said agreement la necessary to give concluded.

In continuation of my official letter I write you in a friendly way to advise you to 'ohey the instructions of the High Government if you wish to avoid tneir serious displeasure, m this friendly letter I a swer the points mentioned in your letter or the 8tn Zi-Qadeh, Firstly# You state that you nad expected that the Government would have given you a cnance to express your views on une question^ My friend, you forget that our friend Major Dickson discussed the matter witn you at length ^.nd took down all your otoeotlons and submitted tnem to me so far -back ~s l »st February »nd I sent tnem on to sovornment, i must observe that the Treaty regarding payment or 5^ duty on goods for British subjects In Bahrain applies to goods destined for c anrain and remaining there and not to goods m transit ior other places. This argument is thereiore entirely irrelevant. How would merchants in Bahrain like it if '.men tney order goods from rurope direct the full Indian duty wer. cn-rged at Bombay simply because th. goods were transhipped there from a London . steamer to a Gulf steamer? At the present time they ouarge notning on cargo transhipped in harbour and only 1/Stn 01 tne duty on cargo landed. If the High Government had given you instructions to act in the same way and charge only l/8 o the duty, you would only have been able to cnarge 5/8 of one per cent instead of 2jS wnich is generally allowed. As regards Tour Excellency's suggestion that ^should be allowed, x beg leave to point out that our friend Major Dickson spent one week in trying to persuade you to agree to tnls amicably andml***and I myself sent a message to you suggesting that this was the rate in 1915 when the Ruler of He*.3d first turned out the Turks o.nd suggesting that it should be reverted to, but you refused to listen. Then the matter had to be referred to the High government and became the sublet of an order, and therefore it was fixed at 2^, -l would remind Your Exce lency that the Ruler of I^a^d intended that no duty at all should be charged but only ardhlyeh. ^ne wigh liovornment itself only cn^rges l/8 duty, it is fortunate therefore for Your Excellency that tne order did not say you could only charge 1 /3 duty I.e. 5/8 of ifo in regard to the 2nd p^rt of tne order as I nave said above the High Government does not (nor do other great G-overnments/ cha^rge any duty at all on direct transhipments, and in nis infringement of sovereign rignts or any others are involved. Ho state h s a rigxxt to cnarge duty on goods destined for another country which simply come to one of its ports by the chances of th« routes of snipping, and ^.rw not even landed on its snores. i m~y mention nowever that this rule is only intended to apply to goods properly manifested for Hasa, Hajd, or Qatar, and brought by steamer. X trust that the above will snow Your Excellency tna. .he order has not Deen issued witnout due consideration and will convince you that no injustice is involved. Should any difri- cultiea result from the orders nd Your Excellency represent tnem, they will receive sympathetic consideration irom the High Government, L Sd/ K.P.Trevor, Lieut-Col.

Addressed Bushire Baghdad.^yiJ lb Political Afrency, Bahrein. i0 ' Dated 15th November, 1920 • To The Deputy Political Resident in Pereian Gulf, 3 a '1 H T R K. In continuation of ny telegram No. 420-! dated the 14th instant, I to forward, herewith enclosed, translation of Bin baud's letter dated fnd November# (1) The situation ii aa follows ;- shaikh Isa, the ruler of Bahrein, has, for some years been accustomed to take V* 1^/- duty on bales of piece gooda destined for Hassa, which were landed at Jahrein, and re-ship^ed arrain without beinp- opened. The arrangement wae come to after 3in laud had renre- aented to Shaikh Isa the great hardshin that the onen- » ing of wirebound bales entailed on merchantrs, seeing that they had thera especially made ud in India, so as to ride easily on camels, shaikh Isa at the time saw the DOint and agreed to charge 3in Gaud on P* 15/- duty per bale. This was undoubtedly a generous concession, and much below the proper duty that lhaikh Isa might have charged. / (2) Under the recent decision of Government of India i Shaikh Isa was ordered to charpre (a) 2^ duty only on'tranship' goods, if landed ' / ;/ on Bahrein pier and re-shinTted within 20 lays to the main land provided such goods ?/ere addressed to well known merchants in Hassa. (b) No duty on goods transhipped into sailing boats direct, which proceeded to mainland norts without touching Bahrein. (3) After much grumbling Shaikh Isa accepted the newnew order* He, however, retaliated by atones l^ntr-uctin? hie Customs authorities to Gba^re 2^ duty on the con tents of all balee of pieoe goodn efoinp' irto Hana. Obviously he did thin in a vnlrit of revenue. ^h ! 3n I heard he had done ao, I pointed out t^e un-T7tTdo!!! of the cove to hia son Shaikh Abdullah, but an Jhailrh Ina technically within hie rights, and ai he waa feeling par ticularly aore at havinpr had to fri^re way to Bin -aud, I decided to let the natter reat, until raiael by Bin laud. I waa further guided in my deciaion by the fact that Shailrh Isa, acting under the auFreation of individuals of Anti-English tendencies nut down the whole cuatoms trouble to me. (incidentally, 7uauf Kanoo ha^ a hand in this)• (4) Shaikh Isa'a new o-der meant that Ne.jd merchants were with two alternatives (a) To have their wire-bound bales broken open and contents valued by the Customs authorities; (b) to have their baled goods in bond until suxjh time as the original bills arrived on which the Customs would charge 2^. Under (^) wa3 imnoasible for merchants to allow the bales to be opened as no baling machines ex ist here, and all bales from Eurone or India are baled under high pressure; U JU (b) they stood the chance of havinpr to pay full 5^ duty, owing to delay in the arrival of manufacturers invoice. Nejd merchant a finding themselves between the devil and the devil and the deep sea, have complained to Bin .3aud. (5) In conversation with Abdul Azi% A1 Quaaibi and Muhamnad Al Hawwaa, both iranortars into Haaaa, T gather that feallng anon* Rejdis In rumlne hlrh. The general complaint is that Shaikh Isa, by his 'ourminff movea move' has quite nullifiscl any advantage 3in 'jaurl calned for his subjaota under th) 2^ rula. ''hay say thay would hava bean batter o'f, if mttar bad bean allowed to ravain aa bafora. Thay are not, far wronf. (6) Aa a matter of fact, I, rathar, foresaw the trouble frora the firat, and In tny o-ifrinal latter to you, vide my letter Mo. 73-3 dated 18th Wa-ch.lOHO. pM,ra 3, I reoommen lad that sH duty ba charged on tran ship gooda and that R' 15/- duty nar bale ranain as mm before. My Idaa was that tba reduced duty should affect the rica trade only. (7) I think now eomething should be done in fairness to Haaaa merchants. I would suggest that &gt;hail h Isa be told that hia nrasent orders regarding 'Baled (roods' be revised seeing that aa thay stand, all the advantages gainad by Haaaa merchanta ara nullified. As this cmnot be Government 'a intention, and as Shaikh laa will doubt- leaa see the reasonableness of Bin Saud's ob.lecUon, ha is instructed to cancel his orders and charge instead a round sum of 80/- par bale. This will work out to on aach bale, aasuming that such contains goods valued at Br! 1,000/-• A fair asauirmtion, I think, considering in TTmri* \m for camsl transport. In anyc^ bales are amall anl made up iyr 4n /ytat R* 20 /- instead of If 15 A wMoh he Shaikh laa will get a. used to charge. a. vmi read this in oon^unC''' (8) I would request that you raaa / * a i i«ttar'/ to you on the subleot tion with my original letter^ quoted above, and let me have your orders at an early data.
