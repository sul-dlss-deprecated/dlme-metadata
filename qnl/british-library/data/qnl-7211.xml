Introduction: a Forecast. In dealing with the history of the Maskat affairs from 1892 onwards it would be well to bear in mind the following facts;— (1) The assurance conveyed by His Highness Seyyid Faisal, Sultan of External A., July 1890, Noa. 128—142 (No. 135). -M as tat, OU his ICCOgnitlOn in March 1890 by the British Government, &lt;f to maintain to the full the same relations as existed with the British Government in the time of his father and to act up to all the engagements undertaken by his father and predecessors in the Government of Maskat,' and his earnest desire ' to be guided in all important matters of policy by the advice of the British Government and to so conduct the government as to secure the continued friendship and approbation of His Excellency the Viceroy and the British Gov ernment.' In May 1891 the French Government complained that the Sultan of secret e., july 1891, Noa. 399—405. Maskat, acting on the advice of the Gov ernment of India, had recently changed the succession to the throne and that such action was in the nature of a Pro tectorate. Lord Salisbury said, in reply, that any advice given by the Indian Government could not be viewed as assumption of Protectorate. He added ; ' Her Majesty's Government is anxious to maintain the independence of Maskat, and the Sultan is accustomed to depend upon our advice in upholding his position As a matter of fact, as the Government of India explained, on the death of the late Sultan in June 1888, his second son assumed the Sultanate, acting completely without our advice or instigation. Our recognition was with held until March 1890, when it was clear that the eldest son of the late Sultan did not oppose his brother and that other aspirants could not oppose him. is o mention had since been made of the question of succession. (2) In September 1890 (Despatch No. 113, dated 8th September 1890) Lord Secret e., march i89i, No.. 113 -125. Lansdowne's Government having advocat ed the assertion of o British protectorate over Maskat, Lord Cross in writing to the Foreign Office observed that the pre dominant influence which Great Britain had exercised in Maskat for nearly a century justified the declaration of ' formal protectorate at the earliest con- • See Maskat Preoi*, 1856—72, chapter xviu, venient opportunity, and as the Anglo- patre 121, as to the circumstaiices ia which the French Declaration* of 1862, bv which Deckrauon was made. England and France bound themselves to respect the independence of the Sultans of Zanzibar and Maskat, has been modified by the recognition this year by France of an exclusive British protectorate over Zanzibar, His Lordship is of opinion that it is advisable to seek for and use an opportunity of withdrawing altogether from the Declar ation of ^ 1862, and establishing an exclusive British protectorate also over Maskat.' Lord Salisbury did not, however, consider it practicable to move in the matter for the time being, but promised to bear in mind the views expressed by Lord Cross and the Government of India in any future negotiations with France upon other matters (Lord Cross's Despatch No. 29-Secret, dated 24ith October 1890). (3) Declaration of the Sultan, dated 20th March 1891, pledging andbind- secret e., march 1891, nos, 113-126, and july ing himself, his heirs and successors. 1891, Nos. 395—398. never to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the dominions of Maskat and Oman or any of their dependencies. secret e„ March 1891, No«. 127—132. (4) The Commercial Treaty of 18th Secret e.. may 1892, nos. m-137. March 1891 with the Sultan of Maskat 2. Ihere was in the year 1891 a demi-official correspondencef between t Brought into the proceedings. Coloiiel Mockler, lolitical Agent, Maskat, 1 Major Talbot, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and the Government of India, which deserves to be read here. The demi. official letter, dated 6th March lh91, of Colonel Mockler with admirable fore sight into tne character of Sayyid Faisal and the signs of the times pourtraya C973FD2 him in his true colours, describes his policy towards the tribes and the British Government, foreshadows all the important questions with which we should be confronted and suggests the means to be adopted for preventing the evils he foresaw. Without quoting the letter at length, the following analysis of its contents will not therefore be out of place here :— Character 0/ Sayyid Faisal. —Though possessed of a dignified manner and pleasing address, he lacked the statesmanship of his father. Arrogant and conceited, suspicious of others by nature, he seldom listened to the advice of others and displayed generally a spirit of opposition to those around him. He was slothful by nature and procrastination and indecision of character ruined most of his schemes for checking unruly tribes or establishing his authority : active he could be, but his activity was rarely roused at the right moment. Sober in his habits, and parsimonious in his domestic life, yet his abortive or ill-conceived measures to punish tribes or to purchase their loyalty involved him in heavy debts. Folicy towards the tribes. —It was one of Latssez Faire. In inter-tribal wars instead of immediately intervening, he allowed matters to slide, until throughout the land there arose a state of chronic red-hot blood feuds—a state of things unparallelled in the worst days of Turki. His hold on the attachment of the tribes was almost nil. Even the Gaffiri tribes, the friends of the dynasty, were little attached to him out of respect or fear. Of the two steam yachts he had JDar 'SS -Salam was sold at Bombay, and the Sultani was allowed to go to pieces by neglect. The Sultan had thus no steam vessels to visit the coast towns in emergencies or on periodical tours for the purpose of keeping himself in touch with the tribes. Even such an im portant part as Sur he visited for the first time only some 13 years after he had began to rule. The result was that he allowed French influence to be estab lished among the tribes, who had been most loyal to his father. But for this neglect of the Sultan to be in touch with the Suri tribes, the French flag ques tion would never have taken the acute phase it has now. Maskat town. —The Sultan did little to repair the ruins caused by the recent storm in Maskat or to improve its sanitation or to make the communi cations with the interior necessary for the improvement of its trade, to protect it from the raids of marauders and robbers, to improve the harbour, wharf, etc. Policy towards the British Government. —He was impatient of the obliga tions attached to the position of a Sovereign under treaty engagements. The very existence of the dynasty to which he belonged as a ruling power at Maskat and his very recognition as a ruler, he owed to the British. His dis position however was such that he could ill-brook their influence. Any representations made to him on behalf of British subjects' interests generally appeared to arouse a spirit of opposition amounting to antagonism. He wished to be independent of the British influence or aid. The French fiag question. —Dr. Jaykar found many Suri dhows putting into the Matrah harbour with slaves on board, and suggested to the Sultan to demand explanation of the Sheikhs as to under what authority they allowed their tribesmen to transfer their nationality to the French. His Highness obtained a list of the flag holders from the Sheikhs. But he made no communi cation to the Agency and no further action was taken at the moment to check the practice. The Remedies. The remedies suggested by Colonel Mockler were these (i) Ihe Sultan should sell Gwadur to the British Government for about 8| lakhs. While this would give a good harbour to Baluchistan consolidated under British jurisdiction, it would replenish the treasury of the Sultan of Maskat and supply the wherewithal to carry out important schemes for consolidating his power.(ii) The Sultan should in the first instance purchase a good steam vessel at a cost of about £15,000. Such a vessel, Colonel Mockler thought a sine qua non for the consolidation and con servation of the Sultan's power along the coast. A small despatch vessel also would be required for ordinary and continued oom- munication with the coast towns. (iii) Creation of fund of about £10,000, the interest of which should be utilized for the improvements of wharves, landing places, fortifications, etc. 2-A. Colonel Ross, to whom the above letter was addressed, had no time to dispose of it before he handed overcharge to Major Talbot. But he expressed his opinions personally to Major Talbot. Colonel Ross was of opinion that the Sultan would not willingly part away with Gwadur and that the measure would be distasteful to the Arabs. Major Talbot feared that a demand for sale of Gwadur so soon after obtaining from the Sultan the declaration not to sell or cede, etc., his land to foreign powers without the British consent, would be regarded with suspicion. Colonel Ross also said that although Sayyid Faisal's power was much more nominal than real, this had been long 'his father's position and it was only in later years of his reign he had consolidated his power. In short Colonel Ross was in favour of letting matters alone and of patience being shown with the Sultan. 3. The Government of India agreed in the views (demi-official of Mr. Cuningham to Major Talbot, dated 20th May 1891). 4. So the '^ policy was adopted by the Government of India at the beginning of the period, which is covered by this precis.4 CHAPTERIL Claims of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to the Sultanate of Zanzibar ; question of his allowances while in India, 1892—95. 5. Since the arrival of Sayyid Abdul Aziz, the late Sayyicl Turki's brother, in Bombay in June 1890, an important factor of disturbances in Oman was removed. 6. On his arrival at Bombay the Government of India telegraphed to Her Majesty's Agent and Consul-Qeneral at Zanzibar enquiring whether there was secet e , november 1890. n... 120-129. objection to His Highness visiting Zanzibar, and were informed m reply that the Sultan Sayyid Ali-bin Said objected strongly to such a visit during his lifetime; that he had sent Abdul Aziz Rs. 5,000, and that he would supply the Jatter's reasonable wants. Arrangements were immediately concerted for preventing Abdul Aziz's departure, and Her Majesty's Agent and Consul- General at Zanzibar was asked what provision the Sultan was prepared to make for Abdul Aziz's maintenanee in India. To this enquiry we received the reply (8th October 1890) that the Sultan was willing to pay Abdul Aziz Rs. 600 a month on the condition that the latter did not go to Zanzibar, and that he did not apply to the Sultan for more money. An intimation to this effect was made to Sayyid Abdul Aziz, who complained (29th October 1890) that the sum was quite insufficient for his maintenanoe He further represented that Sayyid Ali himself had received, before succeeding to the Sultanate, an al lowance of 600 dollars (about Bs. 1,300) a month for his support from his pre decessor, Sayyid Khalifa ; and he expressed a w r ish to proceed to Zanzibar to establish his right to be the next successor to the Sultanate of Zanzibar to arrange for the payment of his debts and tor the management of his lauded estates there. 7. Sultm Sayyid Ali was strongly opposed to the visit, and declined to increase the amount of the allowance to assist his brother in any way to pay his debts, or to grant bis allowance in arrears from the date when it was first offered. But the Sultan finally agreed to grant the allowance from the 24th August 1892, and offered to purchase the garden which was found to be the only landed property owned by Abdul Aziz at Zanzibar. This offer, however, fell through, as the price asked for the garden, viz., 20,000 dollars, was conl sidered excessive. 8. Simultaneously with the steps taken to arrange with the Consul -General at Zanzibar for the maintenanoe of Abdul Aziz in India, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was addressed with a view to ascertaining what terms he could suggest to prevent Abdul Aziz's return to Oman if that was still deemed secret e,, march 1893, Noa. 579— file. ^ U11 desirable. Ihe Political Resi- dent replied on 21st August lh92 that the Sultan of Maskat was willing to grant his uncle, Sayyid Abdul Aziz, an allow ance of Rs. 400 a month, subject to the conditions that he should not return to Oman, that his family should join him, and that there should be no claim against the Sultan for debts contracted by Abdul Aziz. Abdul Aziz declined to accept this offer, urging that his expenses exceeded Rs. 1,500 a month and that if he were to remove his family to India, Rs. 3,000 a month would scarcelv suffice for his maintenance. 9. The terms proposed by the Sultan of Maskat were subsequently modi- *El e i^Nf 0 f!3 9 - dated 17th Ja,luary 1893 ' and the amount of the allowance , 1 a • ..i, o^ed ^vas increased to Rs. 600 a month, but Sayyid Abdul Aziz still refused to receive pecuniary aid from the Sultan of Maskat 10. At the same time he continued to protest against the arrangements secret e., march 1894, Nos. 117 — 240. pioposed for his maintenance in India by , 1 , ,, T ^ )e Sultan of Zanzibar. In a letter ad- dressed to Mr. Lee -Warner, Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Political Department, dated the 26th February 1893, Abdul Aziz brought to notice this pecuniary difficulties, and explained that he had, from time to time up to that period, received from the Sultan sums aggregating Its. 3,600 on6 ^eQunt of Ms albwance, together with a further raoney present of Rs. 4,000. fu o u i at a SUm more ^ an 19,000 remained to be paid to him by the bultan for arrears of allowance, and be begged that steps might be taken tor the payment of these arrears and for the purchase of his garden at Zanzibar. 11. Saltan Sayyid Ali died about the end of February 1893, and was succeeded by his nephew Sayyid Hamid-bin-Thowein. Three months later the new bultan and the Government of Zanzibar decided finally (Consul-General's No. 130, dated Sth June 1S93) («) to pay Abdul Aziz no arrears of the subsis tence allowance for the period previous to the 24th August 1892 ; (b) to accept no responsibility for liabilities incurred by Abdul Aziz ; but (c) to grant him either an increased allowance of Rs. 800 a month or an allowance of Rs. 600 a month and a lump sum of Rs. 5,000 ; and (d) to offer to purchase his garden at Zanzibar tor 6,000 dollars (about Rs. 13,000). , 12 ; The Government of India did not consider it desirable to tell Abdul le i^^ eriia ^ Ve ^ )r0 ^ 0sa ^ s ^ ou ^ the lump sum of Rs. 5,000, and then object to the reduction of his allowance. They, therefore, requested the Government of Bombay to communicate to him the offer of the Sultan of anz^ar to purchase his garden for 6,000 dollars ; and it was intimated to him a Vwi 1 all0VFa ! lce would ,oe increased from Rs. 600 to Rs. 800 a month. Abdul Aziz declined to sell the garden at the price offered ; and the Consul- General at Zanzibar had been informed accordingly. 13. The Government of India consulted the Government of Bombay as to what provision should,* in their opinion, suffice for the Sayyid's reasonable requirements. It appeared that his personal expenses amounted to Rs. 850 a month, but that he would require an allowance of not less than Rs. 2,000 a month, if joined by his wife or wives. 14. Abdul Aziz then submitted a memorial to the Secretary of State, dated Secret E., March 1894, Nos. 117-240 (No. 215). 1893, Urging Ms claims to the # Sultanate of Zanzibar and requesting that the prohibition against his going to Zanzibar or elsewhere might be cancelled, and that pending final orders, his debts might be paid and a suitable allow ance hxed for his maintenance during his stay in India. 15. In submitting this memorial, the Government of India observed (No. ibid No. 239 1 7-Secret—External, dated 31st January 1894):-- , . ',. Sa ^V d J Ab( ? ul ha3 doubtless bpen placed in a trying p-sition, and he has comforted himself with dignity. We think the allowance offered by Zanzibar oaa scarcely be deemed ibtral it may be inadequate; but we desire to leave the question of Abdul Aziz^s allowances for the final decision of Her Majesty's Government, bv whose instructions he is at present detamed in Ind.a. Under no circumstances can Indian Revenues be called to pay anv portion either of the allowance which may eventually be fixed for Sayyid Abdul Aziz, or ofthedebtg he has cootracted at Bombay/' 16. The view taken by the Foreign Office in London on this memorial was secret e .. May 1894, Nos, 577 —583 (No. 579). that the allowance as increased by the Sultan was as much as His Highness could be called upon to give, and that having regard to the financial position of Zanzibar, it was liberal; the Sultan of Maskat was ready to add considerablv to Abdul Aziz's allowance, but this was being declined by the latter (Secretary of State's Despatch j S o , 13-Secret, dated 16th March 1894. C978FD6 CHAPTER III. Inter-tribal wars and Sultan's policy, 1892—95. 17. ' The policy of the Sultan Sayyicl Faisal towards the tribes,' remarks Maior Hay Saddler in his Administra- Maskat Agency Administration Report, 1893-94. ^ of the Maskat Political Agency for the year 1893-94), ' is not marked by that energy and firmness which they would wish to see their ruler exercise towards the settlement of their feuds, which so frequently bre-ik out between them. Interference in their internal affairs they are very ready to resent, but they have been accus tomed to look to their central authority for a decision in the matter of their differences with their neighbours and in this respect the action of the Sultan is often neither timely nor sufficiently assertive. On the other hand, the Sultan's hold over the tribes is but slight, and aggressive or coercive measures might lead to inconveuient reprisals.' 18. ' Oman,' Major Saddler further observes, ' has enjoyed a period of tranquillity for the last five years which is perhaps without a parallel in tbe annals of its history, and to this Sayyid Faisal's mild and little felt rule has, in a measure, contributed. But other causes have been at work—those who have it in their power to cause mischief are either absent or disinclined to move ; no new leader has risen, round whom political intrigues could focus, and the Sheikhs remember that in their attempts against Maskat in the reign of Sayyid Toorkee, the Sultan received assistance from the British Govern ment.' 19. This passage offers a fitting introduction the history of the inter tribal wars from 1S92 to 1S95, when certain of the tribes rose against the Sultan. 20. The year 1892 was signalized by the re-opening of hostilities between the Ghafiri tribes of the Semayil valley and the Hinawi tribes of the Sharkiyeh. ™ ^ Rumours had been current for some time Maskat Administration Report for 1892^3. „ .. ,, oi an intended coalition or the Ghaiin tribes with a view to cutting off the communications of the Hinawi of the Sharkiyeh with Maskat and Matrah, and it was known that the Habus were by no means satisfied with the award made by His Highness in 1891. The peace then concluded was not expected to last. No collision, however, occurred till the middle of August when the Habus raided on the Hahbiyeen and made off with seven hundred goats ; the latter tribe not being able to obtain satis faction, the Ghafiri tribes of the Semayil valley joined together and blocked the roads leading to the capital against Hinawi caravans from the Sharkiyeh. Matters remained in this state for some months, no actual fighting taking place ; several attempts made by His Highness to bring about an understand ing failed, and trade with the Sharkiyeh was at a standstill. In the mean while eight hundred of the Nidabiyeen, the Rahbiyeen and the Beni Jabir leav ing the pnsses blocked marched on Masfa, burnt the village and cut down two hundred date-palms belonging to the Tamimah in retaliation for a murder of a Nidabi who was answerable for the safe conduct of a small party of tbe Beni Harth, Beni Amir, and Beni Hadram on their return journey to the Sharkiyeh when they were attacked by the Tamimah. About the middle of January 1893 His Highness came to the conclusion that he could no longer with due regard to his own prestige hold aloof from the affairs of the Semayil valley, and that more active measures than he had hitherto employed had become necessary ; he accordingly set out via Sib to personally settle the diffe rences between the contending factions ; he was certain of the co-operation of the Ghafiris, but it vas questionable whether the Sheikhs of Habus would come in. After some negotiations these Sheikhs met the Sultan, and peace was concluded on the condition that the Habus should pay their opponents $ 1,200 as compensation for life and property. As this compensation was in reality to be defrayed by the Sultan, the siabus accepted the terms, and after the conclusion of the negotiations returned to their homes, taking the opportu nity on the way of looting some cattle from one of the tribes with whom theybad just made peace. A truce for one year was also effected between the Yai 'W alii bah aud the Grhaliri tribes of the Semayii vailejr. 2 . Turning to the Batinah we find the Yal Saad, the strcmgest tribe in Oman in point of numbers but not remarkable for courage or warlike qualities, establishing a blockade of the routes from the Dhahirah to the sea in conse quence of successive raids made on them by the Ahl Dhahirah. This brought about a coalition of the Yaakib, the Beni Kelban, and the Beni Shikeil, the principal tribes of the Dhahirah against tbe Yai Saad. An advance on each side was driven back, and in January 1893, the coalition of the Ahi Dhahirah broke up, their differences with the Yal Saad remaining unsettled. Repeated raids were however still made on the Yal Saad, nearly all resulting in loss to that tribe in life and property, on one occasion two caravans aggregating seventy camels being cut off. 22. In February this tribe turned the tables on its opponents by pursuing a party of eight men who had carried off some of their goats and killing them to a man. 23. About this time it was reported that Ibrahim-bin-Kais had espoused the cause of his old friends the Yal Saad and offered to mediate between them and the 4hl Dhahirah, being ready it was said to join in an attack on the latter should they refuse his mediation. Later information to the effect that these negotiations fell through, and that no further raids have taken place. 24i. Of other collisions between the tribes the following may be noted :— Early in the year the Harth raided on the Habns at Mudeibee in the Sharkiyeh, and attempted to destroy their water-courses. In August 1892 an engagement took place between the Beni Boo Ali and Beni Boo Hasan in Jaalan, in which nine men were killed. A truce for eight months was effected by Sheikhs Jooma-bin-Sayyid-al-Maskari and Hamud-bin-Sayyid-al-Juhafi, which was broken by the Beni Boo Hasan, killing a slave belonging to the Beni Ali, who thereupon made a raid on the former tribe. This was followed by the plunder of a large caravan of a hundred camels belonging to the Beni JShikeil of Nezwa by the Beai Hasan of Wadi Boshar, A short truce was subsequently brought about. 25. Certain differences between the Jinbeh and the Hinawi tribes of the Sharkiyeh were settled in September, and a peace for one year was concluded through the mediation of liashid-bin-Uzeiz, the Wali of Semayil. 26. In October 1892 that troublesome character Sheikh Hamud-al-Jahafi appeared suddenly in the Batinah with seventy, followers evidently with the intention of marauding. British subjects at Sib were warned to be on the alert, and, if necessary, to move into Maskat with their property. Whatever plans Sheikh Uamud may have formed were cut short by his being taken ill at Manh ; he subsequently returned quietly to the Sharkiyeh. 27. Early in April 1893 a party of 80 of the Beni Hina under the leader- bxterdoi a., july 1893, nob. 78-85. ship of Badr, a son of the Tamimah, Gulf Adminiatration Report, 1893.94.. EUal-bin-Zahir, raided on the Yal Kba- mis, who reside at Hail under the protection of the Beni Umar and Beni Kel ban ; they killed seven of the Yal Khamis and made off with a quantity of camels and goats and some household property, losing four of their number in the encounter. On their return they were pursued by 700 of the Beni Umar and Beni Kelban; 20 of the Beni Hina were killed in the affray that ensued on their refusal to give up the plundered property, and the rest, with the excep tion of their leader, who managed to make good his escape, were made prisoners. At the request of the Tamimah, Hilal-bin-Zahir, Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Kais sent bis nephew, Sayyid Saud-bin-Azzan, to open negotiations for the redemption of the captives. Later on in the month the Beui Hina were attacked at Ghafat by the Beni Shekeyl, who set fire to the place. Amongst other casual ties, Ghusn, the eldest son of the Tamimah of the Beni Hina, with two of his companions, was killed, and Mohamed-bin-Ali, one of the principal Sheikhs of the Beni Shekeyl, was carried wounded off the field. This quarrel owed its8 origin to the Beni Eina persisting in erecting a fort on a plot of land they had bought from the Beni Shekeyl. Hostilities again broke out between the tribes later on in the year ; in September Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali induced them to come to peace, after the Beni Uina had been credited with the murder of a former Kadhi of Maskat and his wife in retaliation for the death of the son of their 1 amimah, the Kadhi having taken an active part in supporting the Beni Shekeyl against the Beni Hina. Sheikh Hilal-bin-Zahir subsequently showing signs of desire to break the peace, a caution from Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali produced the required result. 28. Hostilities between the Yal Saad of the Batinahand the AM Dhahireh were renewed early 1893. On this occasion the Yal Saad were the first to assume the offensive. They attacked Mubrah with a force said to consist of 4.^00 men; further reinforcements were expected, but they did not wait for their arrival. The attack was repulsed, the Yal Saad losing 117 in killed and wounded, the defenders, 7 Sheikhs and 2 men. An attempt at mediation made by the Sultan produced no result. After several minor raids on both sides, the Yal Saad prepared in November for a fresh advance on Mubrah. Say vid Ibra- him-bin-Kais then interlered and at once brought about a cessation of hostile ties. A month later the leading Sheikhs on both sides met before Sayyid Ibra- him-bin-Kais and settled the terms of peace. 29. An old feud between the Beni Mukim and the Suluh of Tewi was renewed in May, the Beni Mukim being the aggressors. They made an expedi tion against Tewi and set fire to a large house in which powder was stored • 14 of the Suluh were killed by the explosion and the fire of the attack, which lost three men. An effectual attempt was made by the Sultan's younger brother fcayyid Fabad, to bring about a reconciliation. Subsequently, Sheikh Saleh put a stop to further hostilities. ■ u 30 ; i 1 ! ''r 16 c 1 oll . isions occurred between the Beni Umar and the Hawa- smeh of Khaboorah in eonsequeace of the murder by the Beui Umar of the Sheikh of the Beni Saeed, a tribe being under the protection of Hawasineh. 31. In the same month the Sultan sent a force under Sayyid Badr-bin-SMf to take possession of Mansoor and oust the garrison of the Beni Ilarras from the tort; the expedition was ill-planned ; and a war cry b ing raised, tlie Sultan's party had to beat a precipitate retreat. His Highness had taken up his quarters at the time m the fort of Nakhl awaiting the arrival of Sheikhs Sulei- man-bm-Seif of the Bern Jabir and Khalfan-bin-flumayyan of Nakhl whom be bad summoned to his presence ; but hearing that these two Sheikhs were preparing to obey bis summons with a force of between 400 and 500 men, he left Nakhl suddenly and returned to Birkah. The Beni Jabir then proceeded Ticinity of Kakhl. ' belongil:,g to two of His Higbness's officials in the 32. In September Hameyd-bin-Salim, commonly known as Kurta a well- known marauder, commenced raiding in the Sharkeyeb; in consequence of rumours that he intended proceeding against Kurryat, the Sultan increased his garrison in that town. Apparently Kurta found enough to occupy his atten- tion m the Sharkeyeh for some time, for it was not till the end of February that he began to move towards Kurryat, His Highness sent orders to the tribes holding the passes leading to the coast to block bis way, and at the same time sent a turther reinforcement to Kurryat. Finding his adyanee checked at the passes, Kurta opened negotiations with the tribes to let him through • failing in this, he returned to his country and sent a humble letter to His' Hiebness' begging for forgiveness. • -if'. 13 ;! 16 Bfrni-Bvi-AK carried on a desultory war with their hereditary foes t e Beni-Bu-Hasan, for some months : no general engagement took place and Sh^rbrSnlphV ir p S ,p ere fe ! V - A trace was effected between them by fhe Jenebah 0 ocourred bet weeu the Yal Wahibah and 34. In Pebruary 1894 peace waa made between the Harth and the AM Bashar through the instrumentality of Sheikh Rashid -bin-Uzaiz the Sultan'^ Wah in Wadi Semmayil. Ibis official was deputed, at the same time, to settle9 the differences between the Ghafiri tribes of the Semmayil Valley and the Ahl* jBosbar ; but when the Ghafiri Sheikhs came to Maskat to receive the indemnity which had been agreed upon, the Sultan declined to pay the full amount. The Sheikhs refused to accept a reduction, and left Maskat feeling muoh aggrieved. 35. This refusal of the Sultan to abide by the terms of the decision which it was understood he had authorised his Wali to make, led to further trouble and loss of life after the close of the ^ear under report. A peace was concluded between the Harth and the Beni Jabir. 36. A serious outbreak of hostilities in the Semmayil valley, which, had it external a ., Une m*. No,. 133.-u6. occurred, would have probably entailed a general inter-tribal w^r, was threatened in 1894, the Ghafiri tribes having intimated to the Ahl-Boshar that they would, attack them alter the £ed on April 8th. A sharp skirmish actually took place between the Hinawis who were supporting the Abl-Boshar and the Ghatiris, while small parties of the Ahl-Boshar were on several occasions attacked by the Nidabiyeen, a section of the Ghafiri tribe. Further fighting was, however, averted by the personal intervention of the Sultan, who succeeded in effecting a settlement of the differences between the tribes, and in inducing them to agree to a formal peace. 37. In May, Sheikh Abdulla, son of Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali, the Tamimeh of the Harth, Sheikh Mohsin-biu-Amir Al-Harithi and Sheikh Amir-bin- Salim, one of the Sheikhs of the Beni-Bu Hassan, arrived at Maskat in the Sultan of Zanzibar's S.S. Avoca. It was stated that they had been on a visit to Zanzibar and had been received with great honour by the Sultan, who, besides other valuable gifts, had presented them with three field-piecea and a considerable supply of gunpowder. 38. Early in June there was serious rioting at Mattrah between some of the Sidee servants of the Khojah residents of that place and a party of Baluchig. The opposing factions twice met in conflict on the beach, and order was with difficulty restored. On the 20th of the same month the inhabitants of Maskat were greatly shocked to learn that Sayyid Eahad, the younger brother of the Sultan, had on the previous night committed suicide. Sayyid Fahad had recently been divorced from his wife, and it was supposed that his domestic troubles had so weighed on his mind as to drive him to put an end to his exist ence. The Political Agent, on being informed of the sad occurrence, paid the Sultan and his elder brother an official visit to express his sympathy with them in their loss, and some days later, in obedience to instructions which had been received from India, he personally conveyed to the two brothers a message of condolence from His Excellency the Viceroy. Towards the end of June it was reported that Sheikh Hammood Al-Jahafi, who has been for many years a fruitful source of trouble to the ruling power in Oman, was endeavouring to excite disaffection in the interior, and that it was his intention to head a rising against the Sultan. The report did not appear to gain much credence. 39. In August the Sultan received news of the murder of Sheikh Hilal- bin-Zahir of the Beni-Hina tribe by Seif-bin-Hamad, the eldest son of the late Sayyid Hamad-bin-Seif-bin-Amir of the Yal-Bu-Said, who was Wali of Nezwah during the reign of Sayyid Turki. Eevenge for the confiscation of the property of his family by the murdered Sheikh was supposed to have been the motive of the murderer who fled for refuge to the Beni-Riyam. At the beginning of September Rashid-bin-Uzaiz, the Wali of Semail, who had been sent to Nezwah, reported to the Sultan that Sheikh Badr-bin-Hilal-bin-Zahir, who w 7 as in possession of that town, was prepared to hand it over to His High ness if he would repair thither in person. It was at first the Sultan's intention to proceed to Nezwah; but on receiving later information which gave him reason to doubt the sincerity of Sheikh Badr-bin Hilal's offer, he abandoned the idea. [0973FD]10 CHAPTER IV. Rebellion of Hinawi tribes under Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali, 1894-95. (i) The events. 40. Towards the end of October 1894 the Sultan received a letter from Political Agent's letter No. 85, dated 13th Septem- Sheikh, who Wrote that he Was visit- *„ March 1895. No. 8999 (No. «).

Sheikh Saleh, also expressed a hope that the Sultan would on the re-openmg of the passes, release the two Ghafiris whom he had seked hossages; and on authentic news reaching Maskat somed^vs later tW t) passes were no longer closed, the two youths were g^ven their ^ J* Mn i! a f; Veek Q 0 ^ Tove ^ ber Rashid-bin-Uzaiz, T\ali of Semail, arrived in skat from Sernail, and reported that peace had been concluded between the Kahabiym and Al-Jawabir, a branch of the tribe of the Al-Habus. off K f e ^ s of f ^ re un P leasan t nature was received in December to tbft effect that there had been a sanguinary conflict between the Beni-Rivam and Bem-Hma residing m Nezwah.

The three Chiefs were received with hospiiahly by the Sultan, who, after according them an audience, dismissed them on the evening of February 12th with the usual presents, and they intimated their intention of leaving Maskat on the same night or early on the following morning. Subsequent events clearly demonstrate that such was never their intention, for after dark a number of their followers, who had not been allowed to enter Maskat, made their way into the town in parties of twos and threes not without exciting the suspicions, however, of the Hyderami and Wahabi soldiers of the Sultan. The latter hastened to inform their master, who thus had ample warning of the treacherous designs of his visitors. The warning was entirely disregarded, the Sultan refusing to believe that, so Ion 1 ' as the Chiefs and their followers were in the town as his guests, they could be guilty of so grave a breach of the rules of Arab hospitality as to take advan tage of their position to attack their liost. He was speedily undeceived, for at daybreak, on the morning of the 13th, his palace was suddenly attacked and the rebels, having overpowered the few guards on duty, proceeded in the direc- tion of his sleepmg apartments with the intention of taking his life. The alarm had, however, been given, and the Sultan supported by' some of his fol- lowers offered a determined resistance ; but, after keeping his assailants at bay for some time, he was eventually compelled to take refuge with his family and adherents m Port Jellali, his brother Sayyid Mahomed -bin-Turku, who had also taken liight from his residence, finding a similar refuge in Fort Merani. -d intelli o ence of this serious state of affairs was brought to the i P - d • • , oace took such steps as were possible for the protection ot British life and property, and addressed a letter to Sheikh Abdullah, the rebel leader, intimating that he would be held responsible for any injury that British subjects might suiter at the hands of his followers. 45. The followers of the Sultan meanwhile, supported by a vigorous cannon ade and rifle fire from Fort Jellali, made a determined attempt to recover pos session ot the palace, which proved, however, unsuccessful, and a lull in the fighting followed, neither party being in sufficient force to take the aggressive The rebels who, simultaneously with the attack on the palace, had seized the town gates, were now masters of the greater part of the town; but they con tented themselves with taking up as strong a defensive position as their sur roundings admitted of, and quietly awaited the arrival of re -inforcements Their proceedings were orderly from the outset; the inhabitants of the town' British and Arab, were not, as a rule interfered with or molested, and it was publicly proclaimed by their leaders that the sole object of the rebellion was to dethrone Sayyid Faisal who, by his weak rule, had shown himself unfitted to govern Oman, and to replace him by a Sultan whose power would make itself ielt throughout the country. It was further announced that the force of rebels in the town was but the advance guard of a much larger force which under the command of Sheikh Saleh was advancing on Maskat, and was hourly ex pected to arrive. , J 46. Early on the morning of February 14th, the mail steamer from the 1 ersian Guit was sighted, and on her arrival about an hour later she was sent without delay to Charbar with a telegram from the Political Agent reporting the outbreak of the rebellion to the Political Resident at Bushire, and request ing that a man-of-war might be despatched as soon as possible to protect British interests at Maskat. On February 18th H.M.S Sphinx arrived and as there had been severe fighting that morning in the quarter of the town' chieny occupied by Baniahs, the Political Agent considered the moment opportune to require a temporary cessation of hostilities in order to enable British subjects to leave the town. In compliance with the request of the Political Agent a truce of a few hours for the purpose indicated was agreed to by both belligerents, and advantage was taken of it to arrange for the^removal of British subjects to a place of safety. At 2 p.m . on the same day RIMS Lawrence arrived, having on board the Political Resident who assumed thenceforth the general direction of affairs, and a third British ship H. M. 8 Uramhle^ivGm. Bombay reached Maskat some days later.12 47. Of the subsequent progress of the rebellion there is but little to record: a desultory warfare extending over a period of some three weeks ensued, carried on by the opposing forces with varying success and interrupted only by a truce of three days demanded by the Political Resident with a view to enabling British subjects, who complained that their shops were being looted, to remove their property from the town. The fighting appeared to be throughout of a half-hearted character, and this was especially noticeable in the Sultan's forces who, although reinforced during the war by strong detachments of the Beni- Bu Ali, the Beni-Easib, and the Hishm, and considerably outnumbering their adversaries, made no determined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capi tal for their sovereign. The evident apathy of his followers had eventually the effect of producing in the mind of the Sultan a feeling of despair of achieving success by their agency, and he had recourse to other and more successful means to bring the war to a conclusion. Negotiations were opened with Sheikh Sal eh, the rebel leader, and on March 9th it was announced that peace had been concluded. The town was evacuated the same evening by the rebels who set fire, as they left, to the Chora Bazar, and it subsequently transpired that they had received some thousands of rupees as the price of their retire ment. (ii) Causes of the rebellion and its failure. 48. Major Saddler in his letter No. 56-A., dated 18th March 1895, assigned secret e , july 1895, nos. 175-268. ^ ie causes to the rebellion and its failure. The cause of the rebellion may be said to be three:-— (1) The weakness of Sayyed Feysal's rule and his unfortunate policy of holding aloof trom the tribes and allowing their quarrels either to adjust themselves or to be settled by the more powerful Sheikhs. (2) The restless ambition of Sheikh Saleh, which, dormant for some years, had been excited b y reception his son and other Sheikhs of his tribe received at the hands of the bultan of Zanzibar during their visit to his capital last year. (3) The comparatively defenceless state of the town against such a coup as that which eliectea its capture. wall S Th \S s S t 0 an W „ a lt e ' 0 H v 0 '™' Str , e I ng, 1 h ' a,,d moft o£ ,he » ™re living outside the Pite thetS tX' of ' e0Uld ^ held 0Ut reliefs a ' ired de8 - al B o rh r e'r ,C/MeA, ' Wo£the r8l ' elUontoeSect th « declared object of its leaders were (1) The rapid rallying of the Ghafiri tribes to the succour of their Sultan. {2) ^tnbpVwh th0 move f m ^ had ^ th e full support of the most important Hinawi tribes, who were not all devoted to Sheikh Saleh's cause. &lt;3) Di :o e ZZ;Tf h Sa,eh,S m0re PartiC0,ar adher 'ts and an absence o £ connection of the Sultan of zlnzib^w^ t,l . e P ossibl e which see Chapter VI, paragraphs 92 ^ lnsurreotlon . about (iii) Imprisonment and punishment by heavy fine of Sayyid Mahomed bin Amn, Vazir to the Sultan of Maskat, 1896. 50.

British policy in regard to, and as a result of. the Ma skat rebellion, (i) The attitude of tlie British Government during tlie Maskat Rebellion. 61. Ihe quesiion as to the attitude the British Government had to adopt Secret e., july 1895, no.. 175-263. during the Maskar, rebellion towards either of the parties was a very delicate one. Our normal policy towards Maskat has always been— (1) to abstain from mixing with dynastic disputes and to recognise the defacto ruler accepted by the Arabs, and not to crop up even a de jure ruler, who could, not hold his own without such support; (2) to abstain from interference in inter-tribal feuds and wars; (3) to prevent the disturbance of the maritime peace ; and (4) to protect the British subjects and property, 52. The policy of non-intervention in case of dynastic disputes was depart ed from only in case of Sayyid Turki; it was decided to give him active sup port in repelling unprovoked aggression during his life time i but such support was to be given to him especially and not to his children, heirs or succes sors. 53. This exception to the normal policy of Government being personal to Sayyid Turki, the question was whether we would be justified in supporting a ruler by force of arms, who was considered by a large number of his subjects a failure. Major Saddler, who was Political Agent at the time and the Eesi- dent Colonel Wilson who arrived at Maskat on 14th Pebruary lb95 adopted an attitude of strict neutrality, and decided only to see to the 'protection of the British subjects and their property. A narrative of their proceedings will not be out of place here. 54. When the insurrection first broke out and the Sultan's palace was Major saddler to Colonel Wilson, No. 56- a ., dst-d packed early in the morning of 13th isth Aiarch 1895. February, the Sultan s wife and her ibid. No. 220. sister-in-law made their way to the agency over the roofs of Baniahs , houses, and informed the Political Agent of the attack on the palace and asked him to protect the Sultan. Major Saddler sent a message offering Mis Highness the protection of the British Agency t should he not be able to hold the palace, any show of force in that direction being out of the question. 55. His Highness shortly afterwards arrived crossing over the intervening houses. Major Saddler offered him and his family the protection of the Con- sulate, in case his position did not admit of any other resort. The Sultan thanked the Political Agent for the offer, but as his forts still held out, he proceeded with his family and attendants to Eort Jellali. 56. On the same day a warning was sent by Major Saddler to Sheikh Abdullah that the rebels would be held responsible for all loss to British subjects in life or property. Notices of nationality were affixed to the doors of the houses of British subjects. The British escort was called to the agency, but owing to the suddenness of the attack the treasure and valuables of British subjects could not be removed to the agency building. At Matrah the Khc'as withdrew to their fort and w r ere given a British flag to hoist, while the Baniahs shut themselves in their houses, affixing notices of nationality on the doors. 57. On the morning of the 14th February, the mail steamer of the British Indi^ Steam Navigation Company arrived at Maskat and was placed at the agent's disposal to be sent to Charbar with his telegram to the Resident. Before the departure of the mail steamer, the Vazir came with a message from His Highness, to ask Major Saddler, if he would send the vessel to Sur to briag up re-inforcement for His Highness. Major Saddler regretted that for several reasons, he was unable to comply with their request. Apart from other consi derations, the fact that the persons and property of our subjects were in the [c973rD]14 hands of the rebels Tvould alone have been sufficient to make the policy of strict neutrality, which he had adopted from the first, one of absolute neces sity. The rebels employed their time during the day in wrecking the Sultan's palaces and auctioning all his furniture and effects which they had not des troyed. Several pieces of furniture and other articles were bought in by Baniahs to return to His Highness; and order was issued forbidding British subjects from having any dealings with the rebels in this connection on their own account. A letter was received from Sheikh Abdullah suggesting a com munity of interests between himself and Major Saddler, and intimating his readi ness to abide by what the Political Agent thought advisable in the interests of all; to this the latter replied that what he required in the present state of affairs in Maskat was the effectual protection of our subjects and their property from his followers. 58. In the afternoon of the 17th February Major Saddler having called on the Sultan, His Highness wished to know (1) whether the Political Agent could mediate between him and the rebels and get them to leave the town before damage was done to property, and (2) w r ho would be responsible for damage done if he descended from the fort and tried to recover the town. To His, Highness's first query Major Saddler replied that he should be happy to afford his good offices, when the proper time for mediation should arrive, but that he doubted whether the opening of negotiations on the basis indicated by His Highness would serve any useful purpose in the present state of affairs, as the rebels had as yet received no check, and they had clearly intimated that their object in seizing Maskat was to obtain the Government; and on the Sultan assuring him that he intended to fight and drive the rebels out, the Political Agent pointed out to him that any overtures might very likely be interpreted by the rebels as a sign of weakness on his part. In offering Ids good offices with a view to mediation should an opportu nity occur the Political Agent was aware that he should have to be careful to in ro way compromise Government with any guarantee to either side. In reply to the Sultan's second question, Major Saddler said that only a general answer could now be given, the Government of a country was- respon sible for the safety of property in its town. He added that when the rebels first appeared, he warned them that they would be held responsible for all damage occurring from their acts, but now they had held possession of the town for five days without any destruction to property, and the situation had some what changed. 59. The Resident Colonel Wilson and the Political Agent held on 2nd March an interview with the rebels' representatives. Sheikh Mohsin-bin-Amin and another Sheikh of the Harth. Asked why they had acted as they had done, they said they wished for a ruler on whom all would be agreed. On its being pointed out to them that all the Hinawis were not with them, they replied that they were, although all the tribes had not yet appeared in strength, they were coming, and all had representatives with them. As regards Zanzi bar, they said they had acted on their own behalf and not on behalf of the Sultan of Zanzibar. With regard to the complaints of looting they said they had done all in their power to stop it and restrain their followers, over whom they admitted they now had not full control. They admitted their responsibility for any damage done which they said they would make good. Asked how they replied that Sheikh Sal eh had wealth and would give full compensation. With regard to their objects, they said they toished to offer the Sultanate to the Sfiltan of and Jctiling hiyyi to one of the sous of Sayi/id Azzan-biw,- Kais. They were anxious that their objects as above should be reported to Government by wire and were told in reply that so far from their wishes re presenting the general opinion of the country, there was no evidence to show that it was the general wish of the Hinawis as their numbers were small and the Ghafiris outnumbered them 4 to 1. They said that the wish of Sheikh Saleh was the wish of the Hinawis. 60. They were told that a small number of them had attacked Sayyid Jj'aisal, who for years had been the friend of Government, and had thrown' the place into confusion and disorder, and caused injury and damage to British16 property, and that this was a most serious matter, and would be regarded as such by GovernmeiLt. To this they said that Sayyid Faisal was not a friend of Government, and that they had chosen Sayyid Hamid-bin-Thoweyni because they knew he was. Asked how it could be presumed Sayyid Faisal was not a friend of Government, they would only say that the fact was clear as the day. 61. 'When the message of the leaders of the insurgents was communicated to the Viceroy, Major Saddler was instructed to infrom them that ' the Qovern- ment of India will not permit union of Zanzibar with Maskat, which was declared distinct and separate more than 30 years ago, and that the property of British subjects must be respected, or active measure for its protection tcill be taken. 02. As regards the conduct of operations by the Sultan, Colonel Wilson wired on 3rd March :— &lt;f Attitude of Sultan of Masqat hardly satisfactory notwithstanding his grave obligations regarding British interests. I can obtain no authentic information regarding his prospects of restoring order, though he has been asked. He lias adequate force, but shows no vigour. If it be desired to demand evacuation of town, only effective means in naval opinion of coercing rebels shelling town, causing great destruction. Have maintained strict neutrality pending further communication from you/'' 63. The Government of India replied on 4th March— ' You will naturally give Sultan no expectation of receiving assistance in coercing rebels'' 64. On the third day of the truce agreed to on 3rd March, the Wazir was asked to convey a message to the Sultan, asking if His Highness would agree to prolong the period of the truce, but this His Highness absolutely declined to do, saying he had received further re-inforcements, more were on their way, and lie hoped soon to be able to make a resolute attack on the rebels' position. In reply the Wazir was told that it rested with His Highness ft) incur the further respon sibility, if such there could be, of declining another day's truce to remove British property still remaining in the town. 65. At 4 p.m . on the 7th, having arranged for a short cessation of hosti lities, Major Saddler proceeded to the customs-house in one of Sphinx's boats, and personally communicated to Sheikh Saleh the orders of Government, to the etfect that :— («) any union between Maskat and Zanzibar was now impossible ; and {h) that British property must be respected or else we should have to take active measures to protect it. He added on behalf of the Resident that the position contemplated in (6) had practically arisen from their recent acts in looting and impending the removal of British property. 66. Sheikh Saleh did not deny that damage had been done by his followers and laid stress on the fact that damage had also been done by the Sultan's people. To this the Political Agent remarked that he had met him with retei ence to matters on his side and not with regard to the shortcomings of the Sultan's followers. Sheikh Saleh then admitted his full responsibility for all damage done by his people, promised full compensation, and asked, with refer ence to property belonging to our subjects still kept in the town, that it might be all removed to a place of safety. 67. With regard to the question of damage and compensation. Major Saddler replied, that he was not a ruler, and that the Government was not in his hands, and that, therefore, although responsibility for damage done by his followers was unquestionable, his mere acceptance of responsibility and promise of compensation could not be accepted as sufficient. 68. In the afternoon an official of His Highness came on board the E.I.M S. Lawrence with letters from the bultan, asking for our active assistance in repelling the rebels. The Resident replied to His Highness the following morning to the effect that the troubles which had be fallen him had caused him (the Resident) much concern, but that he regret ted that he was not authorised to intervene in such an internal contest as then unhappily prevailed, and that therefore he was unable to take the action which His Highness sought. He added that he would be rejoiced to hear that these troubles had come to an end.26 69 After peace had been restored frequent representations were made to the Sultan urging him to dismiss his allies as soon as he possibly could; but this necessarily took time, the claims of all the tribes had to be satisfied by payments in cash, the Sultan's resources were crippled and there was difficulty in obtaining boats for those who had to return by sea. In view of these consi derations and of the fact that this was not a time to consider our claims against the Sultan and take any action which would further add to his difficulties', the liesident authorized Major Saddler to continue the payment of the subsidy as usual. His Highness's cheque was presented on the 13th March and the payment then made was of considerable service to His Highness in his straitened circum stances, and helped to disembarrass him of a portion of his supporterss. . Tlie attitude of the rebel chiefs towards the British Government was satisfactory throughout. They came as they said to rule and not to loot, and their acts were m accordance with their words. For the first few days of the disturbance when the town was whoUy in their hands, not a complaint of the robbery or theft was received, and their arrangements for the protection of life ana property left nothing to be desired. In the Political Agent's dealings with them we found them anxious to meet a 1 his wishes, and on more than one occasion they assured him that the tribes of Oman desired nothing but the friendship and support of the British Govern ment. It was not till the 11th day of the occupation that any robbery took place on their side, and thenceforward it was apparent that the tribesmen were becoming impatient at the protraction of hostilities, and getting more and more out of hand. Later on the tension increased, and finally ended in general pillage and destruction, lor this the leaders were, in the Political Agent's opinion, directly responsible, and this responsibility they admitted, though it was not accepted by us as suffiqient. That the chiefs were unable to cont?ol their followers was no excise whatever for the violation by the tribesmen of British Kdiifr/-? f ^ lntereSt WOuld require us t0 demonstrate to the oirendmg tribes m a forcible manner, wV ^ 1 + V The u S ! llfcan from us any information as to the terms which the rebels exacted from him as the price of their withdrawal.

(b) The continuance to the leaders and the Rustak family of the allow- ances they formerly enjoyed. (c) Forgiveness for past acts. 72.

My athtude tliroughoui ha, bee*, in accordance with the ettailuhad polk,, of Govern. Secret E., July 1895, Nos. 175-26S. men * of nonintervention in the internal affairs adopted by Major Saddler from the first momenT wh^th^ ne ' ltralit ^ this hi)d been blow seized the town, had obliged tbe Suitan to refae , hi/S, ^ ^ a herons means for it had become available, even with tbe di-ecfc and JL * Iu J erferei i ( : e after the interests, could hardly have taken any other form than tW ^ ? gU n ^ British of, the Sultan's operations against his enemies This won'd^ l 00 lI1 ' and dlrect ion17 through tlie heart of the town, consisting of very confined lanes, with closely packed buildinors, and fell at th* outset, after the surprise, into the hands of the rebels. Throughout the stru^le, extending over twenty-five days, the greater part of the town remained in possession of the iebels, and this portion contained by far the larger number of our peopled quarters, which were thus absolutely at their mercy. Ihere was at no time any definite movement or operation of the rebels specifically threatening British property at any particular point which was open to us to resist by force. 1 he sea face exposed to naval attack consists, besides the Political Agency and houses of British traders, of the customs landing place and residences of the Sultan and his relatives. It is true that one of the latter buildings occupied by the enemy was a good deal Mattered by the fort guns, and could doubtless have been effectually destroyed by fire from the ships. But I think it doubtful if this would have seriously affected the enemy, who could have easily retired a little back, and any general use of the fire from our ships would have led to the indiscriminate distruction of the houses not only of British Indian, but also of peaceful Arab subjects, and to a probably extensive conflagration, besides the loss of innocent lives The only practically available course, in my opinion, would have been, as above stated, to have openly sided with the Sultan, directed and aided his operations from the forts, and generally supported and co-operated with him. 4. Apart, however, from the foregoing considerations was the fact that tho rebel leaders had at the outset not only professed the utmost good will towards us and used thwir authority in guarding our people's property but had also displayed a capacity for controlling their followers and checking license, which were highly creditable. • This control unfortunately did not survive the strain of the prolonged hostile occupation, and perhaps also the efforts of the leaders may have later been somewhat relaxed. During the third week there were many complaints of the plunder of the property remaining in the town, from British Indian traders who had on the 18th February been removed from a position of great peril to a place of refuge at one side of the harbour. The position I then considered was such as to justify a demand on our part for a three days' cessation of hostilities to admit of measures for the rescue of such goods as could be removed. The tension became such as to interfere with this truce towards its close, but much merchandise and goods were taken from the town to a place of safety. After this it is to be feared that disorder rapidly increased within the rebel position, and at the last moment reached a climax, for after the evacuation not only were the shops and stores generally found to have been plundered, but the town had been set on fire in several places ; in fact pillage had only been limited by the inability to carry of bulky goods such as rice and grain, and to this had been added gross wanton mischief and destruction. 5. For this, I venture to express my opinion, a reckoning should be exacted; the deplor able result, though not perhaps desired by the rebel Sheikhs, who may receive credit for their exertions in restraining their followers during the earlier days, is one for which they and the tribesmen must, I consider, be held absolutely and fully liable. The principles directing our policy of non-intervention in the internal conflicts of Oman and the considerations governing the question of onr employment of force, above dealt with could hardly be fully appreciated by the Arab tribes who will be more likely to misinterpret our moderation, especially in view of the presence of two of Her Majesty's ships close to the scene. An impression that British property could with impunity be exposed to the rapacity of lawless followers, as an incident in the pursuit of tribal ambitions or enmities would be most unfortunate. Such a feeling would not only render a violent, or ambitious Sheikh reckless in embarking on such enterprises as the one now closed, but would obviously tend to make the tribesmen more ready to follow his lead in the hope of plunder. 6 The conclusion based on the above views which I would submit for the consideration of Government is that the principle of satisfaction should be enforced against those who have violate i British propertv, and this not merely by way of a money compensation for loss, but also in the form of punishment and example. Thus an indemnity might be demanded, and be levied by a cess, apart from the ordinary duties, on the produce exported from the tracts peopled by the offending tribes. And unless Government be disposed to consider the question of closer relations with Oman, carrying with them a more direct concern with its internal affairs, and system of government by its ruler, action with regard to the indemnity, I venture to suggest should take the form of a demand upon the Sultan. In such a case it would be desirable that the fact of this reoaration being the direct consequence of our demand should be accentuated in the clearest manner possible to those affected. 7. The Sultan has not given me any clear intimation as to the measures which he proposes to take in the matter of the injuries which British subjects have suffered. He has doubtless had many pressing cares, and may not yet see his way very clearly. It would have been satis factory, however, if he had enabled me to communicate more fully to Government his own sense of his responsibilities in this connection and his proposals for meeting them. Yesterday morning I paid a formal visit to His Highuess and offered my congratulations on his relief from his recent troubles and my hope that his remaining difficulties might be surmounted. The Sultan replied that what had happened was very serious, and it behoved Government to look into if ; this was a repetition of the remark he had made at my informal visit of the 13tb, to which I had not at the time paid particular attention. It is, as it stands, somewhat vague, C973 1 Df- 18 but its repetition gives it significance, and taken in connection with a remark in the earlier interview, as to cur aid in his enforcement of our claims against the export trade of the rebals perhaps indicates a desire on His Highness's part to lean more directly on the support of government The Sultan, however, on both occasions postponed a clearer expression of his meaning or his wishes, saying he would reply more fully later on important points. 8. Lpon the result of the recent conflict as affecting the authority of the ruler, and the prestige of his powerful opponent. Sheikh Saleh bin AH, it is too early yet to form a mature opinion. *or ail purposes of authority over the tr.bes forming the late coalition against him, the power of tlie Sultan, always weak and seldom exerted, must now be, for the time at least rnm f V a o e r rec ! 1 1 ved c'lastisement for their acts, and have drawn a considerable rw!j 0 f?*V. f r 11 P rice , ot P eace ' Thls an d the heavy payments made to the friendly r^rivJl S '+ ?

On the other hand the crisis has shown a numerous faction arrayed on his side, though perhaps more by reason of hereditary jealousies of their Hinawi rivals than of personal devo tion, and this advantage, if judiciously pressed, might be made means to increase of strength. 1°. As for Sheikh Saleh, his failure to carry to a successful issue the declared obiect of setting up a new ruW, for whxch he had collected a considerable Hinawi followinJ can hardly fa.I to be mjumus. His influence m the Hinawi faction has long been ver/oreat and has made him always a formidable factor in the politics of Oman.

In this connection I have to xeport that a week ago His Highness, while carfully avoiding anv direct request e T + T re t ferenc /= 80unded ^ as to the reception Government would be likelv to accord to the question of assisting him in the way of a loan. I was of course unable in the absence of instructions, to give an opinion, but added that a definite knowledge of His Hio-hness's p nb in reference to the situation would doubtless be necessary to the consideration of such a b i to z fav ™' able notioe i MS'V-'r •'''' i0h dCTOlTed 7 h , im i ' &lt;!0Urse of thes ' &lt;!

From—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Should you consider early action desirable with a view to the recovery of a portion of the indemnity during the present year, the Political Agent may intimate to the Sultan the decision at which the Government of India have arrived in time to time to admit of the issue of the notification to the tribes and of the imposition of the tax before the coming date seasMi opens. The rate of the tax may be settled by His Highness in consultation with the Polit,i&lt;al Agentj on the principle that it should be sufficient to produce in two, or at the most in three ypars the probable amount of the compensation to be awarded. The draft of the notification should be seen and approved by you before it is issued by His Highness, 6. I am to add that should the Sultan show a disposition to evade the question or fail to take effective measures to secure the realisation of the tax, he may be warned that, in the event of his arrangements to exact reparation from the tribes proving unsatisfactory, it might become necessary to recover the amount of the compensation from the Zanzibar subsidy at present piid to His Highness.

I have understood its contents, and I thank you for the friendly sentiments to which you have given expression. It was with much regret, that I learnt of the treacherous attack lately made on Your Highness in your capital by your rebellious subjects, and of the trouble and loss which has been occasioned to Your Highness throughout the protracted course of rebellion. I have since heard through my representative in the Persian Gulf of the retreat of your enemies, and I have now the pleasure of congratulating Your Highness on the restitution of order and security in Maskat. I shall always be glad to hear of Your Highness's welfare.

After visiting20 Bombay, the stenmer procoefled to Sur, where their attempt to land was frustrat ed by the Jenebeh boatmen refusing to take them in their boats. When the vessel arrived at Maskat, they refused to land at the place. The Sultan asked the Political Agent to surrender the men. His Highness could not specify anv olrence against them except that they were members of a tribe, recently impli cated m the rebellion and hostile to His Highness. The persons had not been even present m Oman during the rebellion. The Political Agent did not see ms way to comply with a request, so clearly against the British laws of extra- amon. Ihe Political Agent offered to have the men searched, but the Sultan did not wish this to be done. The Sultan thereupon addressed a Kharita, dated 12th April to the Viceroy complaining against the action of the Political Agent, &lt;£ as contrary to the pro- Mendfhip^' t0 US ^ ^ i ^ U8trious Goverom ent in regard to the usages of a ^/S* If 10 Goyernmeilt of India approved of the action of the Political g^t (No. 2559, dated 13th May 1855) and the Viceroy in a Kharita of the same date explained to the Sultan the true position and stated ' Undcrthcs 8 eireumstanccs Md in the abscnec of ^ny specific charge ao-ainsfc them it would not W oeen possible for the Political Agent to surrender these persons t&gt; Your High ness from a vessel flymg British colours, or to enforce their detention in the manner su^esfed by \our Highness.

The course proposed was only a modification of Lord Dufferin's policy adopted in 1886, which directly in oayyid iurki s reign and indirectly until recently gave Oman unparallelled rest, from internal dissensions. 75. In the event of the assent of France to a British Protectorate over Secrete., April 1896, Nos. 123.82. .

From—• coignel F. a. Wnsoir, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to your telegram of the 8th October, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that having proceeded to Maskat, I paid a visit to the Suitan on the 1st instant, and received a return visit ou the following day. I communicated to His Highness the decision of Government, that having regard to the important British intprests at stake in Maskat and Mattrah, no attacks upon those towns would in future be permitted whatever diSerences might arise between the Sheikhs of Oman and their Ruler. 2. Ihis intimation was not received by the Sultan with the cordial satisfaction that I had expected, and I was somewhat surprised to observe that His Highness seemed to regard the policy which I had been directed to announce to him, as a matter of course. Having regard to the fact that whatever the reasons determining this policy, it is evidently of supreme importance to him in practically giving- to his position and authority the most valuable support of which the circumstances admit, I am at a loss to explain the spirit in which the Sultan appeared to receive the announcement cf it. To my further suggestion, in accordance with what 1 understood to be tbe views of Government, that occasion should be afforded me to make the communication in a more publicly formal manner, in view to its general appreciation, and especially of its unreserved acceptance by the Sheikhs principally concerned, His Highness replied that none of the important Sheikhs, or those especially contemplated being prpgpnt in Maskat, the neces sary arrangements could not at once be made. It was accordingly understood'that when certain of the tribal representatives could be assembled, the Political Agent should have an opportunity of repeating the announcement which has already been made to the Sultan. 3. A number of the principal Hindu traders, wbo presented themselves for an interview with me, expressed lively satisfaction at the present policy of Government, which aflfords them bo valuable an assurance of future immunity from the perils and losses to which they were recently exposed. A copy of their letter, expressing their sense of the benefit secured to them, is enclosed. C97SFD22 79. A notification announcing the Kesolution of the British Government was issued to the leading Sheikhs by the Sultan. As the holding of a Darhar would not be easy and involve heavy expenditure, the Sultan wished to postpone it to a more favourable opportunity. The Political Agent recommended this proposal, as the leading Sheikhs had received the proclamation and knew the fact well (Resident's telegram dated 31st January 1896). The Political Agent was only advised to impress the warning on the Sheikhs visiting Maskat. (v) Present of arms and ammunition to the Sultan of Maskat, 1895. 80. In his letter No. 86, dated 10th April 1895, Major Saddler proposed Secret e., July isoe, N ob. 73-73 .A. ^ u ^an of Maskat might be provid ed with a moderate amount of new arms and ammunition for the defence of his territory against future attacks. Major Talbot supported this proposal. , 81- The Government of India decided to present His Highness with two 6^-inch mortars, including beds, one hundred rounds of ammunition per mortar, and the necessary side-arms (Foreign Department No. 93-E , dated 13th January 1896). 82. The arms and ammunition were sent by the Lawrence and were duly presented to the Sultan on 29th May 1896. (vi) Proposed protectorate over Maskat, 1896. secret e., August 1896, Nos. 157-164. ^ The Viceroy telegraphed to the Sec retary of State on 25th January 1896 . despatcl1 No - dated 24th October 1890* and my des- pateh No. 1^3, dated 9tb July 1895.f The attitude of the Sultan has recently leen very un- sattsfactory, particularly m regard to Dhofar affairs, detailed reports of which will be sent next mail. Ihere are indications of active French intrigues at Maskat and on the Aral coast. Midit Madagascar affairs afford opportunity for securing French consent to our protectorate over Maskat. If possible we would strongly urge that the opportunity should be taken.' 84. The Secretary of State replied on 11th July 1896 &lt;f The Foreign Office appreciates the importance of trying to secure a British protectorate bu considers that the measure could not be successfully accomplished at the present time.' ' (vii) Question of indemnity for losses suffered during the Eehellion. 85. We have seen above that the Government of India approved the pro posal that indemnity for the recent rebellion should be exacted from the secret e , December 1895, noi, 35 -64. offending tribes in form of tax levied on a + ^*c i. i -i their export trade. The Sultan was autho- nsed to notify that the demand was made at the instance of the British Gov- ernment, but was made to understand that his W responsibility was in no way lessened. Ihe tax was to be such as to produce amount required in 2 or at most o years (Foreign Department letter No. 1065-E., dated 29th May 1895) Ihe Sultan practically accepted the proposal without condition. J ' So-A. On the question of preference between British and Maskat subiento the Government of India ruled that the British subjects were to be compen sa fed first, thereafter the Maskat subjects might be compensated also, but «fe tax to be repealed when compensation completed. The American subject (Kevd Mr Zwemer) and French subject (an Algerian) were to he treated as British subject.

The Committee considered 224 claims of British or British protected subiects amounting to $206,040 or Rs. Secret e ., May i«96,Nos. 35-48. 66,919, and found many fraudulent and exaggerated. The final award was for $77|896 at Es. 183=^100 (Resident's Iso. M, dated 25tb January 1896). The Sultan however obstinately clung to view that the British subjects should have no precedence over Maskat subjects, and spoke of sum collected as ' common to four Governments ' (Political Agent's No. 16, dated 9th January 1896). The Sultan was ordered to be told $77,894 must be paid quarterly by instalments within 3 years, minus rateable deduction for 1 American and 1 French claim, otherwise steps would be taken to recover it from the Zanzibar subsidy (Foreign Department, No. 641-E., dated 27th March 1896). 87. Owing to collusion of the Ghafiris, the abuse of exemption of the Hijriyin, absence of effective control at Sur and Sultan's own partiality ia collection at Maskat, collections from indemnity tax were only $9,054 from imposition of tax 1st August 1895 to 14th March 1896, including $650 from Sur. The Sultan was believed to have spent proceeds as received. The Sultan would impose extra 5 per cent, on the secret e., August 1896, N ob. 53 -62. Ghafiris also for connivance and on account of looting done by friendlies making Ghafiri taxes 10 per cent, and Hinawi 15 per cent, altogether (Political Agent's letter No. 78, &gt; dated 1st April 1896). The Government thought it unnecessary to interfere with the Sultan s discretion in taxing Ghafiris. 88. The Government of India directed that the money collected was to be demanded from the Sultan and he to be informed in unmistakeable terms that, failing payment of sum already collected, and the quarterly payment in future of the receipts from the special taxation, the amounts due would, without further notice, be recovered from the Zanzibar subsidy : also that if at the end of 3 years the claims remained unliquidated, the balance^ would be recovered from subsidy in such manner as Government of India might decide (loreign Department letter, dated 22nd June 1896). $11,526 were received from the Sultan. 89. The Ghafiris resenting being subjected to the punitive tax joined hands with the Hinawis in attempting an insurrection under the leadership of Saleh bin Ali, which would have developed serious proportions, but it was nipped in the bud by the death of the leader (see paragraph It 7). The Sultan withdrew the tax on the Ghafiris. 90 The Secretary of State informed the Government of India that as the French were actively interesting secret e., febrcmry 1897, nob. 69-86. themselves in Maskat affairs, the effect of levying unpopular tax on friendly subjects, as well as rebels (injmious to trade and with object of paying indemnity assessed on doubtful evidence) deserved careful consideration of the Government of India. The extreme measure of deductions from the subsidy should therefore be avoided if possible (despatch dated 11th September 1896). 91. The Resident was directed to tell the Sultan that Government trusted it would be unnecessary to resort to such extreme measure as deduction from subsidy. Orders as to indemnity were postponed till the present position was reported (telegram dated 4th January Secret e ., July 1898, Noi. 510 .29. 1897). The Government of India in formed the Secretary of State that no tax was actually levied from Ghaliris and that no deduction would be made from the Zanzibar subsidy ^despatch No. 16, dated 27th January 1897). 91-A. Collections for first half of 1896-97 were only $6,884. Sayyid Faisal asked 6 years to pay off, but promised interest after 3rd year. 91-B To facilitate collection, the collection of the punitive tax was farmed to RatansiParshotam for $15,000 a year As the Sultan appears to have regularly made the payments contemplated by the revised arrangement, and under the then existing circumstances, the Government of Mia thought that no immediate orders were called for (No. 1044-E. A., dated 11th July 1898). 91-C The Political Agent reported on 14th March 1898 that up to date $29,711 had been paid out of $77,894. In 1898 the indemnity tax ^s farmed to Ratansi Parshotam for $18,000, though Damodar Daramsi offered $25,000. The payments then continued to be regularly made.24 CHAPTEK VI. Zanzibar affairsThe supposed connection of the Sultan of Zanzibar with the rebellion at Maskat, 1894-95. (i) Visits of Oman Sheikhs, the leaders of the Maskat rebellion to Zanzibar: their warm reception: the Sultan of Zanzibar's native adviser: 'Hilal bin Omr's intrigues. * 92.

The Sultan of Zanzibar, Major Saddler learnt, had been very profuse in his presents to the four Arab Sheikhs. Among other gifts Sheikh Abdullah received two field pieces and 200 barrels of powder and Sheikh Amar-bin-Salim one field piece and 100 barrels of powder, a form of gift, at which the Sultan of Maskat was much exercised, and expressed astonishment that the Sultan of Zanzibar should have been allowed to make presents of munitions of war to Maskat feudatories, who were by no means friendly disposed towards their Sultan. 99. The Government of India therefore in their despatch No. 150 (Secret— _ T , w External), dated 14ith August 1894, sug- Secret E., September 1894, No. 17. ^ was des i ra ble tO take Steps to restrain the Sultan of Zanzibar from presenting field pieces and ammunition to visitors from Maskat, as otherwise the peace of Oman might be disturbed. 100. When under the orders of the Earl of Kimberley, Sir A. Hardinge represented to the Sultan of Zanzibar, the secret e ., Jmuary i89o, Nos. 26/-276. inexpediency of his proceedings, the latter repudiated the idea of his having ever had in view to instigate disturbances in Masknt and assured that the practice of making presents of munitions of war would be discontinued. Sir Llyod Mathew, however, informed Sir A. Hardinge that at heart the Sultan still cherished the idea, even though he fully recog nised that it could not be realized, of re-uniting Zanzibar and Maskat. Sir A. Hardinge reporting these facts observed (No. 254, dated 24th October 1894)— [Jimself a native of Maskat he has never quite lost touch of the friends and dependents of his father ) Sayyed Thowaniy in that Sultanate and he imagines that as Ruler of Oman he would perhaps be more free than he can be at Zanzibar from the direct control of the Britxth Government.' 101. Sheikh Hnmid Jahafi returned to Sur about the middle of May 1894, and three Harethi Sheikhs Abdullah-bin-Saleh, Mohsin-bin-Omr and Omr-bin-Salim returned to that place on 26th May on the Sultan's ship Avoca, Leaving their luggage at Sur they sailed to Maskat to pay their respects to the Sultan. No sooner had they proceeded to the interior that they began to work out the plan of their conspiracy that led to the rebellion in February—March 1895, the events of which have been described above. 102. Sir A. Hardinge, in his letter No. 49, dated 13th March 1895, reported to the Earl of Kimberley the secret e ., June 1895, Nos. 145-46. depleted condition of Sultan's Treasury owing to careless and extravagant management of his private fortune. The Consul- General added — ' He has spent lavishly in gifts to Mo skat Sheikhs, in the foolish hope of some day playing a part in Oman politics, and his chief native adviser, &amp; Maskat Arab, named Hilal-bin' Omr, has, I believe, encouraged him in this course/' 103. Hilal-bin-Omr deserves more than a passing notice. He played an important part in Zanzibar and Oman and contributed, it was justly believed, in no small degree to the rebellion of 1895 in Maskat. He was the brother of Mohsin-bin-Omr and son-in-law of Saleh-bin-Ali, two of the prin cipal insurgents. Sir A. Hardinge believed that he encouraged a good deal the Sultan of Zanzibar in his secret designs for the re-union of Maskat and Zanzibar and flattered his impatience of the British control. As chief adviser of the Sultan, he was the intermediary between His Highness and the Oman visitors. He nearly pursuaded the Sultan to buy land in Oman, where coal was said to have been found, in order that His Highness might have increasing interests in those lands. 104. We thus find the following circumstances, the cumulative force of which could point only in one direction (a) Two of the principal leaders in the Maskat rebellion were near re latives and had been in close touch with the chief native adviser of the Sultan of Zanzibar. (b) These leaders with other disaffected Oman Sheikhs had received a warm welcome and presents at Zanzibar partly in the shape of a large quantity of munitions of war. [0973I , D]26 (c) Soon after their return to Oman from Zanzibar, the rebellion broke out. {d) Ihe professed object of the leaders of the rebellion was to place Sayyid Hamid-bia-Thoweyni on the throne of Maskat in place of Sayyid Faisal. The last fact was telegraphed by the Government of India to the Secretary of State on brd March 1895. The Foreign Office thereupon instructed Sir A. Hardinge to again warn the Sultan against his having any connection with the Maskat politics. Sir A. Hardinge in an interview with the Sultan on the 8th April 1895 pointed Secret E,, July 1895, Nos. 364-366. out to him the only reasonable inference tliat could be drawn from the recent pro ceedings on Zanzibar, and warned him against involving himself in Oman affairs. The Sultan of course disclaimed in the strongest terms any connection with the recent events in Oman (Sir A. Hardinge's No. 66, dated 8th April 1895). 1^5. That the Sultan of Zanzibar in any way encouraged the rebellion SecietE,|December 1895, Nog. 216-217, after the warning conveyed to him in , October 1894 there was much doubt in mr A. iJardinge s inmd, though he might have encouraged the idea of the union oi Maskat and Zanzibar previously, and it was possible that Hilal-bin- Omr might have still held out hopes of dragging the Sultan in the Oman affairs (Sir A.

Major Fagan also objected to the presence in Oman of any person, which was likely to have a disturbing influence. The Government of India concurred in this opinion (Despatch No. l/3-8ecret—External, dated 30th December 1897). Her Majesty's Gov ernment accordingly declined to grant the request of Hilal.

British loans to the Sultan of Maskat in 1895-97: proposed loan of an officer to reform customs, 1898. 109. In September 1895 the Sultan asked in writing for a loan of $30,000, to be recovered by deduction of $1,000 per mensem from Zanzibar subsidy. secret e., december 1895, nos. 61—66. The Sultan verbally stated that, if his secret e., april 1896, nos. 18l-191. request could not be granted, he would have to apply for help elsewhere. The necessity for loan had not been properly stated. The Government of India sanctioned a loan of Rs. 60,000 with interest at 41 per cent., repayable by monthly instalments of Rs. 2,000, to be deducted from the Zanzibar subsidy, the loan being conditional on written assurances from Sultan that it would be devoted to meeting present difficulties, and that Sultan would not borrow from any other foreign power while the loan remained unrepaid (Foreign Department letter No. 1986-E., dated 29th October 1895). Sultan accepted the terms. 110. In 1893 the Sultan determined to attack Beni Ruaheh against Cap tain Beville's advice and asked for a loan of Rs. 20,000 in anticipation of sanc tion of Government. Captain Beville refused to comply. The Sultan also asked for a loan of Rs. 40,000 to punish tribes in the interior and break down all opposition to his rule. On 1st November the Sultan asked for $20,000 down to pay off troops in anticipation of sanction. Captain Beville again refused to comply (bis letter No. 300, dated 10th November 1896). 111. The Government of India required, as condition of any loan, that the Sultan should fully explain the purpose for which the loan was required, the manner in which it would be utilised and his actual financial position. The Sultan's response was not cordial or full. He estimated his liabilities at $130,000. The Government replied that they were not willing to give assist ance for an expedition against Beni Ruaheh, but were willing to help the Sultan if he would give explanations already asked for (Foreign Department telegram, dated 18th May 1897). 112. The Sultan's expenditure was about $700 per mensem in excess of Secret R, April 1897. No., 6a- 63. J 1100111 ;- He intended to effect a reduo. tion of $2,000 per mensem. The Customs had been sold for $24,000, though worth $150,000. Sayyid Faisal like Sayyid Turki had no extravagant tastes. This time he gave the informa tion unreservedly. $100,000 were wanted to pay the loan borrowed during rebellion without interest, being due to the Banyas and Arabs. $33,000 bore interest at 20 per cent, per mensem : this last Sultan desired to pay off by means of loan of Rs. 60,000. He wanted Rs. 40,000 also to pay off Arab credi tors. Captain Beville advanced Rs. 5,200 on his own responsibility (Political Agent's letter No. 170, dated 2nd June 1897). A loan of Rs. 60,000 was sanctioned on the same terms as the previous loan, repayment to commence when the first loan would be discharged. The Government of India expressed a desire that the Sultan must undertake to show the Political A^ent that ordinary expendi ture, including refund instalments, could and would be kept within ordinary income, and the Political Agent, if necessary, should take means to secure that the loan was not diverted from the declared object, viz., of paying debts which bore exorbitant interest (Foreign Department telegram, dated'28th June 1897). 113. Hopes were also held out that if the Sultan gave proof of resolve to place finances on sound basis. Government would consider a third advance of Rs. 40,000 to pay off Arab creditors. Government would lend a suitable officer to reform customs if the Sultan desired (Foreign Department letter No. 1172, dated 21st July 1897). The Sultan gave necessary assurances as to extinction of debts bearing exorbitant interest and balancing of revenue and expenditure. 114. As the customs, the Resident reported that the Sultan was likely to secret e., March 1898, Nob. 12-19. consent to give the Government of India control over customs Department for ten years and asked for permission to promise as an inducement, if necessary, an advance of one year's customs revenue. Lord Salisbury, however, con- sidered that (ictual and divect control of ths JUasJcat customs by the GoveTti* ment of India woidd conflict with the independence of the Sultan secured by the declaration of 1862, but that the object in view might he secured by the Sultan s appointment of a British officer as Superintendent of his ens- toms and by an advance of money to the Sultan or the security of the customs (Secretary of Stale's telegram, dated IStu February lb98j.29 OliAPTEE VII f. Eebellion in Ehofar, 1895-97. (i) Designs of Sheikh Fadhl bin Alawi, the Moplah outlaw, to assume the Govern ment of Dhofar, 1894-96. 115. Sheikh Fadhl 'bin Alawi was a Moplah priest who was expelled from India under threat of arrest if he returned for the part he took in the Moplah rising of 1862. He first settled in Mecca. But in or about the year 1868 he went to Dhofar and haying gained considerable influence over the people, he soon after was elected by them their Amir. He ruled in the name of the Turkish Government, but his rule was found so oppressive that a rebellion broke out in 1879 and he was expelled from Dhofar in 1879. Sayyid Turki, Sultan of Maskat, resumed possession of the district to which he claimed a title as old as 1829. Since then Dhofar was in the uninterrupted possession of the Government of Maskat, until the year 1895, when a rebellion broke out. 116. Tor about a year before the rebellion.

Currie forwarded to Lord Kimberley a memorandum placed in his hands by a friend of Sheikh Eadhl, stating that he was anxious to leave Turkey and return to Arabia with his sons, with the view of assuming the Government of Dhofar, Mirabad and its dependencies under British pro tection (Sir P. Currie's despatch to the Foreign Office, dated 12th October 189 A). 117. The Secretary of State, Mr. Fowler, in sending the papers to the lbid No 430 Government of India for opinion, observ ed (despatch No. 51 Secret-dated 9th November 1894)— ' It is understood that Dhofar is now under the control of the Sultan of Mascat and this circumstance alone would render a compliance with the Sheikh 's request inadmissible.' 118. The Government of India concurred on this opinion (despatch No. ii-d No 435 Secret—External, dated 29th January 1895). They stated— 'Sheikh Fadhl bin Alawi was expelled from Dhofar in 1879 and shortly afterwards the Sultan of Maseat, at the invitation of the people appointed a Wali and occupied the place with a garrison. For the last 14 years the rule of His Highness over Dhofar and its dependencies has been uninterrupted and active, and we therefore agree with you in considering that the request of the Sheikh is inadmissible.' I ' 119. In March 1895 Sheikh Fadhl's son Sahl Pasha proceeded to Cairo and tried through Shakour Beg, Chief Interpreter of the Intelligence De partment of the Egyptian Army, to obtain an interview with Lord Cromer and enlist his sympathies in Sheikh Fadhl's designs to re-establish his authority in Dhofar. He expressed his intention to visit Dhofar early, and mentioned that he had been in communication with the Sheikhs in Dhofar to prepare them for this. 120. Lord Kimberley, after consulting Mr. Fowler, informed Lord Cromer— ' That it is undesirable that he should enter into communication with Sahl Pasha and that the territory which the Sheikh seeks to recover cannot be restored to him, as it has been under the rule of the Sultan of Mascat for the last fourteen years.' 121. When the above correspondence was forwarded to the Government of India, they telegraphed to the Resident on 9th May 1895 :— ' Sayyed Fadhl, Moplah outlaw, desires to return to Dhofar, and his son Sahl Pasha, lately in Cairo, is intriguing towards that end. Please warn Sultan, Mascat.' 122. The Sultan stated that the object of Sheikh Fadhl and his son was to create disturbances and excite sedition among the people of Dhofar, and that he relied upon the British Government to take steps to prevent them from carrying out their designs. Colonel Wilson redorted that the Sultan's position [C973FD]30 in Dhofar was not a strong one and his small garrison there would not be able to repel an attack of Sahl Pasha in case he should arrive with an armed force (Colonel Wilson's No. 125, dated 29th May 1895). 123. The Government of India thereupon directed Colonel Wilson to advise the Sultan to put the defences of Dhofar in proper order, to reinforce the garrij-on, and to arm the men suitably. The Government of Bombay was also requested to instruct the Political Resident at Aden to keep a careful watch for any movement of Sayyid J ^adhl or his party from that direction. (ii) Outbreak of the rebellion, 1895-96. 124. While Sheikh Sadhl and his son were intriguing at Constantinople « . it t ! ^ xt anez *** and Cairo to return to Dhofar, the tribes in Secret E., July 1896, Noa. 296-369. xi ^ l j • x .n • n . that district were seething with discontent against the rule of Maskat under Wali Suileiman-bin-Suweilim, the greatest of the military leaders the Sultan could boast of and in whose loyalty and ability His Highness placed implicit reliance. Loud complaints were made by the people against what they alleged to be oppressive and extortionate demands of the Vali. As their complaints were unheeded, the Katheri tribe led by Sheikh Salim-bin-Hamad Al-Mahruni with his brother backed up by Sheikh Al-bin Katheri suddenly rose in rebellion, attacked the fort on the 3rd of November 1895, killed the Sultan's Naib Vali, a son and a nephew of the Vali (who was at the time at Maskat) and ten or twelve of the garrison, and captured the fort. 125. The immediate cause of the attack was said to have been the im- prisonment of a man of the Katheri tribe, accused of having evaded payment of some dues. But the fact that nearly the whole of the population of Dhofar sided with the Katheri tribe showed that discontent with the Sultan's rule must have been general. 126. The news of the rising reached Maskat only on the 25th of Novem ber. The Sultan promptly fitted out and despatched an expedition to Merbat, consisting of 100 Wahabis and 150 of the Beni Kalban tribe, which was ex pected to be reinforced at Merbat, where the tribes were loyal to the Sultan. The expedition was led by Sayyid Seif-bin Hamad-bin-Salim, a distant relation of His Highness. 127. The bullan's forces after halting at Merbat tried to land at Dhofar failed in their attempt. It was found that Sheikh Awadh-bin-Azzan, the Chief of the bhanafirah tribe, had also made common cause with the insurgents though without joining actively the hostilities. 128. A flag was flying on the fort, which was presumed to be Turkish. It was suspected also that the emissaries of Sheikh Eadhl, the exiled Moplah, were at Dhofar. The matters having become thus complicated, the British Government could not view without concern the affairs in Dhofar. The coast was said to possess a good harbour, which could be converted to^good purpose, and it was of importance that it should not pass into the hands of a foreign power. 3 129. It was therefore desirable to ascertain whether Sheikh Fadhl or his people were at Dhofar and whether the Turkish flag was flying, and for this pur pose Major Saddler suggested that one of Her Majesty's ships should proceed to that place (Major Saddler's No. 28, dated 23rd January 1896).

The Government of India accordingly ordered that Major Saddler Secret e. ( July 1896, Nos. 296-369. should visit Dhofar in the JBrisk under , , ^ , . tlie authority of the Sultan to effect the best settlement possible, warning the Katheris that they would not be allowed to establish the Moplah outlaw as ruler ; that the Sultan should be advised to be conciliatory to the Katheris and that the late Vali should not be re-appointed (telegram to Resident, dated 26th .February 1896).31 131 The above facts and proceedings were reported in brief by telegram to the Secretary of State and a request made that instructions might be issued to the Consuls at Cairo and Jeddah to watch any movement of Sheikh ladM or his people (teleeram dated 1st March) . ius v o 132 Ma . or gaddl0r ia the Brisk pro- IhU &gt; Ko - 328 - ceeded to Dhofar early in March. 133.

In a detailed report, dated the ibid, No. 329. igtll Marc i 1 X896, Major Saddler explained the position The terms offered by the Sultan to the Katheris were— (a) Forgiveness for the past. {V) Dismissal of Sheikh Suleiman and the appointment of a Wali of a conciliatory disposition. (c) No more than the customary 5 per cent, to be levied in future. (d) Grievances to receive prompt attention. The Sultan intended to appoint his * brother,' Seif-bin-Hamad, as Wall, and Major Saddler apparently approved the selection. 135-A. Major Saddler's interview with the rebel Sheikhs of Dhofar was ' most unsatisfactory,' and the leading Sheikh maintained a defiant attitude. 136 Major Saddler found the Turkish flag flying at Salala. He could nnf collect any prior information as regards the supposed connection of the not ® oliec ^ P., th rebellion. It was rumoured that the insurgents had Moplah outlaw q in ifoTi of Shehr and Makalla, but that he had offered the province to i dependencv of Maskat, that thenthey ' odd «? tl.

The Sultan's reply was to the effect that Major Saddler had found the Katheris stubbornly hostile ; and that His Highness was not now 4 inclined to conciliate them.' 141. Mr. Lee-Warner's demi-official letter of the 7th August says—'When Secret e ., June 1897, Noa. ii7o. tll . e ^ askat papers were discussed in Com mittee, two criticisms were advanced and seemed to me to find general support. One was that the Political Agent did not act firmly enough. The other was that the Sultan must have been per plexed and rendered suspicious when he was not told what arrangements were to be made on his recovery of Dhofar.' 142. The Resident was told in June 1806 to report early if the Sultan save any indication of his future intentions as to Dbofar, and, if he failed to do so w^hin the three or four months, to advice the Government of India what should be done. Colonel Wilson sent no report till the 19th December and then he merely telegraphed— 4 Sultan has permitted former Wali Suleiman to prepare expedition for recovery Dhofar.' Government of India replied by enquiring whether Colonel Wilson considered the intention of re-employing Sheikh Sulci* man should be accepted; whether the Sultan was in earnest; whence His High ness would get the necessary funds, and what force he proposed to employ. Colonel Wilson s answer was-J I am not disposed to recommend permanent employment of Suleiman at Dhofar ; but he might perhaps conduct expedition- ary force. He has been trying to collect funds on the Batineh Coast Saltan himself appears lukewarm Would Government in any case renew the offer of assistance, man-of-war ? Political Agent recommends pecuniary aid. May I hold out hopes if it appears advisable ? (Telegram dated 23th December 1890).

On this ground Government counselled Sultan last year to declare Sheikh Suleiman should nut return Dhofar.

Thirdly —As to indpmnity—Secr^taiy of State is averse to recovering from Zanzibar subsidy any portifn of sum due to British subjects.

Fourthly. — Use your discretion as to order in which Sultan should be approached on above pnints and amount of pressure us -d, bearing constantly in mind import ance of maintaining influence over, and friendly relations with^ him. 145. The question of lending the assistance of a man-of-war to the Sultan, and the extent to which such assistance could be utilized was a delicate one. The Government of India attached much importance to the exclusion of foreign encroachment from the Dhofar coast, and notwithstanding their avowed policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Maskat, the Viceroy had obtained Her Mnjesty's Government's permission to support by the guns of our gunboats the advance of the Sultan's troops. As reported in the Foreign Office letter, dated 19th June 1896, the Moplah outlay Sayyid Fadhl had been warned that he would not be permitted to proceed to Dhofar and that his Agent would nut be recognized there. But he was by no means satisfied with the communi- Secret E., November 1996* N ob. *-4. ca, ' io ° to hir. : on the contrary he questioned the authority of the British Government to prevent his proceeding to Dhofar. He remarked in a letter, dated 22nd August 189o, addressed to Mr. Herbert:— ' I have never asked either for permission to proceed myself to Dhofar nor for official recognition of my envoy. For I am under no obligation to ask of any Slate permission to go to Dhofar. There are Governments which recognize the official character of my state and function^ aries. 1 have at bhofar a representative and officials, who carry on the government. ' 146. Sheikh Fadhl and his sons were pensioners and title-holders under the Porte, and there could be little doubt as to the power by which the Sheikh was backed up or encouraged in his designs against Dhofar. The attitude therefore adopted by the British Government of departing from their normal policy non intervention in the internal affairs of Maskat was amply justified in this case. 147. But the British Government had at the same time to take into account the French intrigues in Oman and their susceptibilities in the mattar of Maskat's ^independence,' Their Vice-Consul M. Ottavi, it was evident, had now the ear of the Sultan, and spared no efforts for poisoning his mind with suspicions of the British motives. In Abdul Aziz, Dragoman of the French Consulate as well as a Munshi on the Sultan's services, M. Ottavi found an able instrument to work his ends. 148. To the French Government a communication on the subject of our Secret e., j .i, 1.96, Ho.. 136.369 (No. 326). j 'tentions was authorized to be made under the directions of Lord Salisbury, coupled with an assurance that the action proposed in support of the Sultan's authority implied no intention of esablishing any protectorate over Maskat (Secretary of State's telegram, dated 28th March 1896). 149. In May 1896 the French Ambassador, Baron deCourcel called at secret June 1896, Nos. 11.70. the Foreign Office and complained against (Nos. 17-18.) the British Government sending their man- of-war to assist the Sultan in quelling the Dhofar rebellion and deprecated the [C978FD]34 vnVaternl aotion of this nature in respect of the existing agreement between Great Britain and France to respect the independence of Maskat. Lord Salis bury briefly gave the history of recent rebellions on Oman as well as Dhofar, referred to the warning given to the Oman Sheikhs against attacking Mattrah and Maskat, and assured that the action proposed to be taken in case of the Bhofar rebellion ' implied no intention on the part of Her Majesty 's Govern ment of establishing any protectorate over Maskat or any departure from the engagements taken in the declaration of March 10th, 1862, to respect the inde- pendmce o/i/avW (Lord Salisbury's letter to Lord Butferin, No. 183-A., dated Si7th May 1896). 150. Colonol Wilson on his arrival at Maskat on 14th January 1897, had an interview with the Sultan. His Hiffh- Ibxd, No. 22, i o j_i • ^ i» ness pressed tor the assistance ot a man- of-war for the recovery of Dhofar, but firmly insisted on his employing Sheikh Suleiman bin Suweilim to restore and maintain his authority there. Colonel 'Wilson after discussing the situation with the Sultan, recommended the sending a man-of-war on the same conditions as were proposed the previous year, the Political Agent accompanying and having the controlling voice in the negotia tions with the local Sheikhs (Colonel Wilson's No. 2-A., dated 19tli January 1897). 151. The Viceroy wished to comply with tbe request accordingly but re ferred the matter to the Secretary of State with reference to Lord Salisbury's letter to Lord Dufferin, No. 183-A., dated 27th May. 152. The Secretary of State replied on 10th February 1897 :— ' Lord Salisbury has no objection to course proposed, but calls attention to the import ance of the agreement of 1862, being- carefully borne in mind and of nothing being done, which could imply any encroachiment on independence of Sultan. Please warn your Atrent to deal considerately and discreetly with any difficulty with French Consul which may arise.' (v) Insurrection brought to an end through British intervention. 153. The Government of India accordingly instructed the Political Eesi- Colonel wiiaon's No. 27, dated 25th March 1897. dent in the Persian Gulf that we were I6id ' N °- 57 * prepared to comply with the Sultan's re quest for the assistance of a man-of-war, but that this assistance would be limited to supporting, by guns from the anchorage, the advance of His High- ness's troops if, after 48 hours' notice, the Sultan's authority was not recognized, and we at the same time communicated to Colonel Wilson the desire of Her Majesty's Government that the importance of the Joint Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 should be carefully borne in mind ; that nothing should be done which could imply any encroachment on the independence of the Sultan ; and that any difficulty which might arise with the French Vice-Consul at Maskat should be considerately and discreetly dealt with. Our views as to the policy to be adopt ed at Dhofar were explained by Colonel Wilson to the Sultan, who expressed his general concurrence. H, M. S. Cossack was thereupon ordered to proceed to Maskat. 154. After a final interview with the Sultan, Colonel Wilson sailed for Dhofar on the 12th March in the E. I. M. S. Lawrence, accompanied by the Cossack carrying the Political Agent, Captain F. G. Beville, with Sheikh Hamad-bin-Nasir, Wali of Mattrah, the Sultan's brother, Sayyid Mahomed, and about 70 followers. The Sultan's main force of 300 men had been sent on in advance. The former Wali of Dhofar, Sheikh Suleiman-bin-Suweilim, was temporarily absent from Maskat and the Wali of Mattrah was provisionally placed in charge of the Sultan's interests. The Resident considered the selec tion a good one and the absence of Sheikh Suleiman not inopportune. 155. On arrival off Dhofar on the 16th March, Colonel Wilson found the Turkish flag flying over a tower near the beach and from a flag-stalf at Murabim. Be addressed the leading Sheikhs by letter, explaining the object of his visit and inviting them to a meeting with Captain Beville on shore. A long inter view followed at which the Sheikhs reiterated their complaints of oppression by Suleiman-bin-Suweilim, but proposed submission on certain conditions. When informed that these conditions were inadmissible, the Sheikhs first35 declared themselves under Turldsh protection, and finally tlieir leader in lima ted the wish of the tribe to be taken under British protection, or to receive a British guarantee for the redress of any future grievances. On the evening of the 17th, Colonel Wilson required the Sheikhs in writing to submit within two days to the authority of the ISultan, on the promise of pardon for the past, and the assurance that no new taxes would be imposed, and that any just complaints would be listened to. The Sheikhs were warned that force would be employed if the terms given to them were not complied with. At dawn on the 20th the Turkish flags had been struck; they were soon after sent on board the Law- reuce^ and resistance was at an end. On the 21st Colonel Wilson landed and confirmed the assurances already given to the Sheikhs. 156. Colonel Wilson left for Maskat and Bushire on the 21st March, but the Cossack with the Political Agent remained two days longer at Dhofar. Captain Beville had further interviews with the Sheikhs and reported that they appeared to be satisfied and not unwilling to accept Sheikh Suleiman as Wali should the Sultan re-appoint him. In the meantime Sheikh Suleiman had actually sailed from Maskat to take up the appointment. Captain Beville was of opinion, after making careful enquiries, that the retention of Sheikh Suleiman as Wali was the only means of securing the Sultan's authority in 'Dhofar, and that His Highness had no official strong enough to take Sheikh Suleiman's place. On the 9th May Colonel Wilson reported that this latest advices from Dhofar were dated the 9th April : all was then quiet and Sheikh Suleiman had not yet arrived. The Sultan has expressed his cordial acknowledg ments for the assistance rendered to him. 157. The Government of India approved of the action taken by Colonel Wilson, and requested him to convey our congratulations to the Sultan.36 CHAPTER IX. Tribal wars and risings subsequent to the Maskat Eebellion. 158. In the month of April 1895 a party of the Harth tribe arrived from external a., july isns, nos.57.66. Zanzibar in a British steamer. His Maikat Administration Report for 1895-96. Highness the Sultan demanded that these persons, who belonged to Saleh bin Ali's tribe and hence enemies of His Highness, should be handed over to him, bnt there bein&lt;? no proof of the persons in question having committed any offence against His Highness, the request was not complied with. In order, however, to prevent complications, the persons in question were taken on to Bundar Abbass and landed there. ^ 159. During this month rumours were current that Saleh bin Ali intended making a demonstration towards Semail with the object of alienating the Gha- firi tribe from the rule of the Sultan: 160. Many of the Sheikhs from the Semail and Sur came to Maskat during the month of April to visit the Sultan and in order to obtain from him recognition, in the shape of money, of the services rendered to His Highness by them in the rebellion. Amongst others, the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh of Sur, the Beni Bu Ali, Beni Hina, Hishem Beni Bu, Hasan Beni Umar, Naeem, Beni Basib Hijrieen, Beni Oomer visited Maskat during the past year, with the object of obtaining money from His Highness the Sultan. This' system of subsidising the Sheikhs outside Maskat, which was instituted by Sayyed Turki has been a source of great weakness to the Sultan, as naturally the Sheikh's demands continued increasing and so payment to them of subsidies without effecting any great good tends to keep the Sultan impoverished. 161. During the month of May and June 1895 several small disturbances external a., dacember 1895, nos. 55 -77. occurred in the interior, but none of ^ Maekiit Admin dtration these disturbances exceeded the normal inter-tribal disputes of past years. The only importance to be attached to these mter-tribal disputes is that Saleh bin Ali on several occasions tried to turn these disputes to account but not successfully. One of the more important of these inter-tribal disputes was the one that occurred in June between the Nazar assisted by the Beni Rian and the Yemen with the Beni Ruwaheh at Zikki Ihis dispute at one time threatened to lead to a general rising and much bloodshed and as Saleh was endeavouring to turn this to account. His Highness deputed his elder brother Sayyed Mahomed bin Turki to proceed to Semail and effect a settlement. Sayyed Mahomed left in June under as escort of Hmawis and returned in July after restoring tranquillitv. In the month of July the Bern Bu Hasan attacked the Beni Bu Ali at Jalaan but no very serious consequences ensued. * *0 the murder of a Ruwahi hy a Hadramee in September the pcaco of the Semail valley was again disturbed and fighting ensued between the (jhann and the Hmawis. ^ o i 16 *- f 1 u . rtlier occur red in Oman to break the peace until November Nezwah by the Beni s'hikeyil 111 ^ ^ Bem Hlna WaS assassinated at bin SuweS t^Nezwah'to a^em^a reconciliation, between the opposing factions, and to induce the Beni Hina in Ghafat to evacuate Nezwah, and to obtain possession of this, the ancient capital Oman, for the Sultan. TV ith a view to bringing pressure to beqr upon the Beni Hina, Suleiman bin Suweilim obtained possession of Ghafat This act was naturally viewed with apprehension by Saleh bin Ali and Saood bm^zzan who moved in the direction of Nezwah, but before their intrioues could be ot any effect, Suleiman bin Suweihm had already obtained possession of Nezwah by the simple expedient of buying out the garrison. Having successfully accomplished hia mission, Suleiman bin Saweilim returned to37 Maskat at the end of Pebruary, where he was received with great honour by the Sultan who attached much importance to the town of Nezwah, and thinks that its possession will be of considerable political importance to him. The garrison now holding the town on behalf of the Sultan is said to number about thirty men. 165. In the month of December 1895 reports were received that Sayyed Saood bin Azzan was making preparations to attack the town of Sohar in the Batineh. Saood had collected a considerable force from amongst the Yal Saad, Mawasineh, Beni Saeed, Makabil and Beni Nairn tribes. The Sultan seeing the necessity for prompt action, despatched a force of 120 men under the command of Sheikh Hamud bin Nasir, in a steamer which happened to be in the harbour at the time. The arrival of these reinforcements enabled the Wali to repulse the attempt of Saood to seize the town, and Saood was forced to retire. Saood on retiring made a feint at Khabooreh, but here he was also unsuccessful; he thereuponretired and joined Saleh bin All and no further trouble was experienced from him during the year under report. 166. Since the imposition of the punitive tax upon the Hinawi in August 1895, Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali al Harthi Administration Report, 1896-97. ^ eil( l eavours to turn this circumstance to account. In May 1896, Saleh found his opportunity. The Sultan, partly with a view to carrying out the wishes of the Government of India in regard to the completion of the indemnity to British subjects for losses incurred, within the period fixed, and which he considered impossible upon the basis originally decided upon, and also partly with a view to reple nishing his empty exchequer, decided to impose a tax upon the produce of the Ghafiris as well as upon that already imposed upon the rebel Hinawi. 167. Saleh at once seized the opportunity thus offered him and effected a coalition between the Beni Ruaheh (Hinawi) and a portion of the Beni Jabir (Ghafiri), and proceeded to attack Seja which was held by the Beni Hadram and by such of the Jabir as remained faithful to His Highness the Sultan. Saleh himself, though upwards of 75 years of age, assumed command of the allied tribes. During one of the petty skirmishes that ensured, a stray bullet deprived the rebels of their leader, and ended the life of the bitterest and the most able opponent of the ruling house. Had the Sultan at once seized the opportunity the death of this famous leader gave him, and attacked the rebels, there seems to be no doubt but that he would have been successsful. Saleh was killed early in September, and it was not until late in October that the Sultan with a force of about 7,000 men left for the interior. As soon as the Sultan heard of the opposition that would be raised against the increase in taxation, he cancelled the orders imposing a tax upon the produce of the Ghafiris, and he thus was able to detach the Beni Jabir from the coalition consisting principally of the Beni Buaheh. The long delay that took place prior to a start enabled the Beni Ruaheh to overcome their first panic at the loss of their leader, and they were accordingly in a position to oppose the Sultan's advance. The difference between the opposing forces was that the Beni Buaheh were fighting for their homes, whereas the Sultan's troops were mercenaries, who like most Omani Arabs show extreme valour so long as they receive their pay and are not within striking distance of the enemy. As a natural result of relying only upon such troops, the Sultan at the critical moment was deserted by most of the Sheikhs who had, though really friendly to the enemy, professed allegiance to His Highness, and he returned to Maskati without having accomplished anything beyond the expenditure of about $60,000. 168. Owing to a dispute between two factions in Nakhl, there appeared to be fears of an outbreak in that district in the month of June. The Sultan accom panied by a few hundred men proceeded to the place and was able to restore order without further trouble. 169. In May 1897 rumours were current of unrest amongst the Beni Euwa- heh and Beni Jabir fomented by Sheikh Rashid, the Sultan's Wali at Semail, who, for purposes of his own, was endeavouring to set these tribes against one another. Quiet was, however, restored. [C973FD]88 170. In June a disturbance occurred at NakM, Sheikh Khalfan bin Thenayan, a very troublesome personage, being the aggressor. Fifty men were despatched with the Wali of Barka to restore order and to arrest Khalfan bin Thenayan, but the latter evaded capture by flight and has hitherto suc ceeded in retaining his liberty, notwithstanding several attempts to effect his capture. 171. In December the Beni Ruwaheb attacked Seyma, a place belon^in? to the Beni Hadram and took it with a loss to the defenders of three men killed and six taken prisoners. On hearing the news Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, Wali of the Semail, interceded between the parties and succeeded in effecting the restoration of Seyma to the Beni Hadram. 172. Suleiman bin Suweilim, the Governor of Dhofar, arrived at that Dhofar. place on the 15th April and took over charge of his duties. 173. In April and May, two bodies of men belonging fo His Hfehness's xr™ 0 / 1 ^ riurQ bering in all about 45 men, deserted and returned to Masqat. • Sh0rt ^ after Suleiman bin Suweilim's arrival at Hhofar in April -c lu a? ^}' ia ;bitants of Hafa attacked those of Salala with the result that one 0 p ft r W as killed. In this affair Suleiman favoured the inhabitants ot Hafa, and was strongly suspected of being the instigator of the quarrel between the parties. On the matter being reported to the Sultan, His Highness sent letters via Bombay and Aden recalling Suleiman and appointing Say ved Seif bm larab as Governor in his place. 175. Suleiman did not obey the order of recall till the end of Pebruarv ^ nd ,7 hei L he Jid so he brought back with him the Sultan's nominee, Sawed Sei nn Yarab, and left his Nubian, slave, Noobie, an illiterate and absolutely worthless individual, to act as Wali in his place. 176. In November 1897, the Wall's nephew and an Arab who accommni. ed him, were attacked and killed by the Kara hillmen. compam39 CHAPTER X. Trade and Customs, 1895—98. (i) Closing of the scales at Matrah except for the weighing Fard dates, 1895. 177. Sayyid Faisal and his predecessor, Sayyid Turki, have always looked External A., May 1805, Nog. 194-214. Wi ^ 1 ^ 011 ^ ie ^igkbourillg port or Matrah which, not cut off as Maskat is from land communication with the interior, is the natural outlet for the trade especially in dates finding its way to the sea from this portion of Oman. One of the means the Sultans have had to recourse to benefit Maskat at the expense of Matrah, has been to enforce the weighment of dates at Maskat brought in the first instance to Matrah. The first known attempt was made in 1880, and subsequently in 1885 and 1889, when on each occasion the protest of the Political Agents forced the hands of the Sultans to restore the status ante quo. 178. The forth attempt was made by Sayyid Faisal in August 1895, when His Highness suddenly ordered the closing of the scales at Matrah to the weighment of other than Fard dates (Major Saddler to llesident, dated 30th August 1894). 179. The exemption of the Fard dates from the operation of the order was made in the interests of America, which had a practical monopoly of their export trade. This privilege. Major Saddler thought, unduly favoured the American trade as against a portion of the Indian trade, which is contrary to the treaty of 1891 (Article 2), 180. The order also, as argued by Major Saddler, offended against Article 4, because it was a restriction on purchasing and selling articles of native produc tion 'every ivhere' and compelled British Indian merchants to purchase dates at Maskat, which might be purchased at Matrah, their natural export depot, at less cost and with less inconvenience and delay. 181. The Sultan contended that the practice now enforced by him was an ancient one only recently interrupted under order of the late Sayyid Turki to avoid quarrels between the Arabs and British Indian subjects, and that the weighing of the dates of Matrah mined the port of Maskafc. As a matter of fact the ancient practice was quite the reverse—interrupted by forcicg occasionally the export of dates from Matrah to Maskat, in the interests of the Baniahs, who had an interest on the customs in Maskat and have been always jealous of the Khojah merchants of Matrah, 182. Colonel Wilson wrote to the Sultan arguing the points, but His Highness was obdurate and wished the question to be referred for orders of the Government of India. The llesident pointed oat that the trade of Maskat had decreased because it had ceased to be the important emporium it had been, when navigation on the Persian Gulf had been dangerous on account of piracies and ships had to halt at Maskat before proceeding to the Gulf, or had to tranship their cargo there (Colonel Wilson's No. 7, dated 20th January 1895). 183. Before the Government of India passed any orders on the question, it was reported that the scales had been re-opened at Matrah on 25th April 1895 under orders passed by the Sultan of his own accord (Resident's No. 22, dated 13th April 1895). Bat no communication had been made to the Political Agent. 184. The Government of India then directed that the Political Agent should intimate to His Highness that they had heard with satisfaction of the removal of a restriction which was calculated to injuriously affect British sub jects doing business in dates at Matrah and trusted that His Highness would not in future sanction measures likely to hamper trade (Foreign Department No. 94i5-E., dated 14th May 1895). (ii) Sultan's order insisting on uniform weights of hags of rice imported^ 1897. 185. In May 1897 an attempt was made by the Sultan to insist that all n 1P A, • •. f t? . IRQ- OS of rice imported into Maskat should Gulf Administration Eeport, 1897-88. i c •&gt; • -i , ^ be of one uniform weight. As such an order was calculated to hamper trade and to benefit nobody, the matter was represented to His Highness, who then revoked his order.40 (iii) Levy o£ exorbitant taxes on the fish-yards at Qwadur, 1897. 186. In August 1897, the officer in Political charge of the Mekran Coast forwarded a petition from the Gun Administratiou Report, 1897.98. Briti8h Indiau tr aders at Gwadur, repre- senting that an attempt was being made by the Sultan to levy exorbitant taxes on the fish-yards owned by them, and suggesting that the taxes should be reduced by two-thirds. Personal enquiries made by the Political Agent on the spot showed that the complaints of the owners of the fish-yards were well founded, and that the taxes which it was sought to levy were out of all proportion to the profits made by these individuals, some of whom had already closed their yards in consequence of its imposition. 187. On the matter being represented to the Sultan, His Highness was at first indisposed to make any change, but ultimately he was induced to agree to the proposed reduction. (iv) Mining concessions in Maskat and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, 1898. 187-A. In a letter addressed to the British Kesidency at Bushire, dated 11th May 1898, Messrs. A. and J. J. Malcolm enquired whether the Residency would have any objection to their acquiring from the Sultan of Maskat, the Sheikh of Sharjah and other similar independent Sheikhs, the concession of mining rights for a number of years on deposits of oxide of iron said to exist in certain islands and seaboards such as Abu Musa, Musandum, etc., and whether the British Government agents would extend their good offices on furtherance of their objects. 188. The Government of India instructed the Resident to reply that the Resident would view with pleasure any legitimate trading enterprise, but could not show favour to individuals by exercising their good ' offices ' on their behalf. The Resident was also asked to let the Sultan of Maskat and the various local Sheikhs know informally that he would be ready to help them with advice in respect of any proposals made to them for trading privileges, making it clear to them that there was no desire to interfere with their discre tion, but that it would be to their advantage to consult the Residency before granting concessions. In this manner the Resident would secure the oppor tunity of protecting the Chiefs from unscrupulous traders (Foreign Department letter, dated 10th July 1898). \ b t41 CHAPTER XI. British extra-territorial jurisdiction in Maskat. (i) Arrangements made for the trial of offences—(1) committed within the territory of the Sultan of Maskat on the Mekran Coast and (2) at the telegraph stations of Jask and Charbar and along the alignment of telegraph between these two places—1892-93. 189. The Political Eesident in his letter No. 82, dated 9th July 1892, Eiternsl a.. March 1894. No. l-u. recOIUOieDded— (1) that the officer in political charge of the Mekran Coast might be appointed a Magistrate of the first class and J ustice of the Peace within the territory of the Sultan of Maskat on the Mekran coast under sections 4 and 6 of Act XXI of 1879 (Foreign Jurisdiction and Extradition Act); (2) that the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs be appointed a Subordinate Magistrate, first class, and Justice of the Peace at the Telegraph Stations of Jask and Charbar, and along alignment of the telegraph line between the two places, under sections 12 and 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section &amp; of the ' Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council.' 190. As to the first proposal, the Government of India pointed out that the territory in question could not be held to be of a Prince or state in India in alliance with Her Majesty for which only Justice of the Peace, whose juris diction is confined to European British subjects and their accomplices, could be appointed. At the same time there could be no objection to the officer, for the time being in political charge of the Mekran Coast, exercising jurisdiction over Native Indian subjects on the Sultan's territory on that coast, 191. As regards the second proposal, the Secretary of State's sanction was asked, and as it was pointed out that there was a doubt whether even, under the operation of section 39 of the Criminal Procedure Code (which has been made applicable under ' The Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, ' the officer in question could be appointed a Magistrate ex-officio, the powers in question had to be conferred personally (Secretary of State's Despatches No. 10-PoL, dated 9th Eebruary 1893, and No. 76»Pol., dated 2nd November 1893). 192.

(ii) Murder on high seas on a ship flying British colours and question of jurisdiction of the British. Consular Court, 1893. 193. A case of murder was brought for trial before the British Consular Court at Maskat in March 1893, in which external a., August 1893, Nos. 80-33. one of the crew of the ship Humat/unshah that had sailed from Calcutta, had been murdered. Both the murdered man and the murderer were Arabs, and it was not clear on what authority the ship flew the British flag. 19 i. Dr. Jayakar, Acting Political Agent, before whom the case first came, thought that the most advisable course would be to transfer the case to the Sultan, before whom the witnesses could easily be summoned and there was every facility of a full and fair trial. 195. Major Saddler thought that the case being one of murder committed in the high seas in a ship flying British colours, would be governed by section 267 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 17 and 18 Vict. Chap. 104), Part 3. 196. Colonel Talbot pointed-out that the note on page 451 of Wheaton's International Law lays down principles, which tend to show that the Arab ship referred to could not he considered British merely because she flew British colours, unless she was owned by naturalized British subjects which was not apparently the case. Consequently section 267 of the Merchant Shipping Act could not seem to be applicable, as this refers to offences on ships owned by British subjects. And as, moreover, no failure of justice was anticipated and the case would be more expeditiously concluded at Maskat, Colonel Talbot was of opinion that it might be advantageously committed to the Sultan (Colonel Talbot to Political Agent, Maskat, No. 19, dated 14th May 1893). 197. The Government of India agreed in Colonel Talbot's view (Foreign Department No. 1503-E, dated 15th July 1893). (iii) Status of Ali-bin-Juma, a Baluchi domiciled in Maskat in respect of (1) natural ization and (2) jurisdiction, 1895. 198. In a civil suit filed against one Ali-bin-Juma before the Political Agent, Maskat, the question was raised whether the British Consular Court had jurisdiction to try the civil suit. The defendant was a Baluchi, who had a permanent domicile at Maskat, but who had in 1808 obtained at Bombay a certificate of naturalization, and who since 1872 had been borne on the Con sular Register at Maskat as a British subject. 199. The views of the Government of India on the question were expressed in their letter No. 478-E., dated 2nd March 1895 :—43 2. 'With reference to the general question of the Ali-bin-Juma's status, I am to say that unless the law of Maskat recognises naturalizatioa aboard as a valid aboegation of bis former nationality, Ali-bin-Juma must, ordinaiily speaking, be regarded while in Maskat as a subject of the Sultan, 3. But as to the question of jurisdiction, in respect to the particular civil suit which has been filed against him in the Consular Court at Maskat, I am to observe that under section 6 of the Maskat Order in Council, 1867, Her Majesty's Consul at Maskat has jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature arising between British subjects, and the provisions of that order with regard to British subjects are declared under section 35 to extend to all subjects ^ of Her Majesty whether by birth or naturalization. B-egard being had to these provisions the Political Agent appears to he, prima, facie, entitled to exercise jurisdiction over Ali-bin-Juma; and in view of the allegations made by Aii-bin-Juma when he obtained his certificate ot naturalization at Bombay, and of a further fact that he caused himself to be enrolled on the Consular Register as a British subject, the Government of India are disposed to think that he may properly be regarded as debarred from pleading to the jurisdiction on the ground that he is not a Baitish subject. 4. In these circumstances the Government of India have no objection to the Consul at Maskat trying the case so long as no objection is raised by the Maskat authorities. 199-A. The Sultan was anxious that Ali-bin-Juma should be removed from our protection, on the ground that this Secret e ., Apvii 1898, Noa. 205-209. case and others of a similar nature had been quoted by Mon. Ottavi, the French Vice-Consul, in jurisdiction of his own actioa in according French protection tc a number of His Highness subjects, who had been granted the right to fly after a short residence in Obok arid other French possessions. As this request appeared reasonable and accorded with the ruling in paragraph 2 of the abore quoted Foreign Depart ment letter, Major Fagan struck out the man's name from the Consular List (Major Fagan to Resident, No. 3-B., dated 25tli November 1897.) 200. The Political Agent's action was approved by the Government of India (Foreign Department No. 293-E.A., dated 18th February 1898).44 CHAPTER XIL Collisions and Wrecks of ships on the Oman Coast, 1893—97. 201.

TllC history of this increase IS rep,1893,5.6. maiinly connected with the liberal grant of French papers and flags to Suri Arabs for their dhows, under which they claimed French protection. We shall devote a separate chapter (chapter XIV) to this French flag question, and summarise here the correspondence connected with the appointment of a French F^ce-Oonsul at Maskat. 205. In the course of a discussion in the French Chamber of Deputies in « i, T* *«■ i. November 1892, M. F. Delonde stated Secret E., May 1893, Nos. 1-4, ^ , • i i -j x i • i that he considered it to be incumbent on the obligations and honors of France to have a Consularf Agent of some kind at Maskat to keep a register of French protected subjects, adding that of late years Bussian influence had begun to make headway against that of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf and that his proposal would be a proof of the comhinpd action of France with the great nation i which is her ally. The Minis ter for Foreign Affairs replied that the matter was under consideration and that he hoped in a short time to be able to satisfy M. Delonde in this matter. 206. In July 189i the Foreign Office received news that the French c ^ t, c t u ion4 xr Qfk -« Government had decided to establish a Secret E., September 1894, Nos. 89-94. ^ .-.r,, , Consulate at Maskat and appointed Mon sieur Ottavi, Dragoman to the French Consulate at Mogador, to the post. Lord Kimberley asked for Mr. Fowler's observations on the matter. + „ n , . T , , Mir. Fowler, referred to the correspond- J SeeChapter I, paragraph 1. n onA+ i t» u ence or 18901 on the proposed British protectorate over Maskat, and observed that as the Sultan of Maskat continued to be nominally an independent ruler, though practically in subsidiary relation with the Indian Government, it would be difficult to contest the right of the French Government to appoint a Consul at Maskat so long as the Anglo-French declaration of 1862 remained in existence and a British protectorate over Oman was not declared (India Office to the Foreign Office, dated 17th July 1894). 207. Mr. A Hardinge, His Majesty's Agent at Zanzibar, in his despatch, Secret E.. October 1894, Kos. 41 -46. ^ ated 7th July 1894 pointed Out that, trom an Indian point of view, the presence of a French Consul at what is practically a Native Indian Court would be objectionable and would not be warranted by the ' interests of commerce ' referred to in connection with the appointment of Consuls in article 5 of the Treaty signed between France and Maskat in 1814, but that from the Zanzibar Government point of view, it would be hardly less so, as it would afford additional encouragement to the Suri Arabs, who though Maskat sub jects, claimed French protection and attempted to carry on slave trade between Oman and Zanzibar under the shelter of the French flags after giving a good deal of trouble (see also paragraph 250 below). 208. M. Paul Ottavi, who had been appointed French F^e-Consul at Secret e ., February 1895, N ob . 438-453. Maskat, arrived there by mail steamer from Karachi on 8th November 1894. 208 a ., Ext. b ., May 1895, Nos. 315- 317. The French cruiser Troude visited Maskat in March 1895. 209. There is nothing important to note of the activity of other powers than France in Maskat from 1892 to 1898, except that in September 1893 the secret e., july 1894, noi. 58-67. Russian Volunteer cruiser JS/ijni Novgorod Secret E., January 1895. Nos. 22-23. visited Maskat and SOme of its officers had a secret interview with the Sultan. There were in 1894 rumours of Russian intrigues, and of the presence of a Secret Agent of theirs who helped these intrigues. f It appears that a French Ftce-Consul was appointed in 1874, but the appointment never took effect. Colonel Miles was asked by the French Consular at; Baghdad to accept the post, but he declined to accept it (Poli- tical A., January 1881, Nos. 19-25, and Political A., February 1874, Nos. 8-10) [C973FD]46 CHAPTER XIV. The French Flag Question, 1863—98. (i) Early History. 210. The origin of the practice of granting French Flags to owners or masters of Arab vessels of the Oman and Zanzibar coasts and of the claim to the exercise of French protection over such persons is far from clear. 211. The only subjects of the Sultan who could legitimately claim French protection are such as are actually in their service under article 4 of the Franco- Maskat Treaty of 184-1, which provides :— 'The subjects of Sayid Saeed bio Sultan, the Sultan of Ma sir at, actually in the service of the French shall enjoy the same privileges, which are granted to the French tnemselves, but if such subjects of His Highness shall be convicted of any crime or infraction of the law they shall be discharged by the French, and delivered over to the authorities of the place/' 212. Article 6 of the same treaty provides for ex-territorial jurisdiction in case of French subjects, which however is excluded in case of Maskat subjects referred 'to an article 4 in criminal cases. It does not appear that for Maskat subjects holding French flags, the French authorities have ever claimed the full status of French subjects (by naturalization) or any higher station than that of being their proteges. 213. Though in theory the French authorities have never apparently de fined the position of these proteges under international law, in individual cases they have asserted a jurisdiction over them which the British Government exercises over subjects of the protected Native States in India. As to the latter, the Government of India in 1866 laid down the principle (Foreign Department letter No. 104, dated 3rd February 1866) :— 'The subjects of any Native State bound, as Kutchis, to have no relations with Foreign Powers, are morally entitled to be admitted in foreign territory to all the privileges which the natives of India enjoy in the same localities and the Sultan of Maskat and the subjects of Kutch, residents in his dominions, seem neither of them to entertain any doubt on this point. His Excellency in Council conceives that there can be no obstacles to Political Agent at Maskat exercising the same authority in respect of Kutchis as in respect to British subjects. The Political Agent should be authorised to act in accordance with this opinion/' 214. The French Flag Question attracted attention of the British Govern ment as early as 1863, from which year we shall trace its history. The practice of granting French flag had begun probably earlier, and though it was brought to notice of Her Majesty's Government in 1863 and occasionally after wards, and it frustrated to a great extent the British Crusade against slavery, it does not appear to have been for several years objected to. 215. J here are two or three points that should be distinguished in studying this important question :— (1) the right of granting flags and papers to Maskat and Zanzibar subjects and exercising protection over them on the high seas; (2) the right of exercising protection over such persons in the Maskat and Zanzibar territorial waters {a) to the extent of Police, (b) to the extent of ^^-territorial civil and criminal jurisdiction; (3) the right of British cruisers to search vessels flving the French flag— {«) on the high seas, (6) in territorial waters of Maskat and Zanzibar. 216. When in the middle of the 19th century the British cruisers vigorously prosecuted search of every Arab vessels, flying the Arab flag, on the presump tion that they were engaged in slave trade, an European flag was eagerly sought as affording protection from the inquisitorial visits of our cruisers The ^ Tf n m * it]pd to % ^e British flag under a pass tamed tiom the British Consuls at Zanzibar and Maskat. But the grant of47 such passes to subjects of Native States of India by the British Consuls was objected to as unauthorized by the Government of India, only the Governor proceedings, Pol. a , December is68, Nos. 403-412. General or the Governors of Provinces be- Merchant shipping Accounts. jnoj authorized to grant tliem under Act X of 1811 and Act XI of 1850. It was however finally decided that the Acts did not apply to East Africa. Provincial boat passes giving the riifht to the use of the British Merchant flag were issued accordingly to vessels, wholly owned by British Indians or subjects of British Indian protected States. This practice has apparently continued up to date [see also memorandum of Sir J. Kirk in Sec. E., September 1900, Nos. 5-56 (No. 9, Enclosure 5, Sub-en- closure 6j.] 217. The Erench authorities at Mayotte and Nossibe * began about the year 1860 to issue Erench registers to • French Colonies in the (-omaro islands. vessels of Arabs trading regularly with Political a..

The Arabs sought the Erench flag all the more eagerly as affording them more protection than did even the British flag to British Indian subjects or subiects of Indian Native Stares, since through the British flag generally afforded presumption that the vessel flying it was not a slave trading one, it did not save them from search by British vessels, while the Erench flag saved the vessels flying it from every interference from British cruisers as also from Erench cruisers, which were seldom seen in Indian waters. On the other hand, the Erench authorities were no less eager to extend the use of tins flag as a means of extension of their influence over a body of active traders m Bast Africa and Arabia. 219. When reporting in his No. B. 1—30, dated 10th April 1869,^ the destruction of 16 slaving dhows by the JSymphe the Officiating Political Agent, Zanzibar, Dr. Kirk, wrote &lt;f Captain M&lt;5ade tells mc that to the south almost every dhow is now under the French flao- • that when last year orly five dhows with French flag w^re seen by tha Nynwhe during her muse in the san* ports, this year there are fifty ; and that so well do the natives know th^ iealousy with which Fiance protects her rights, that dhow owners to d him plainly that he had no rio-ht to touch them if even they had a cargo of slaves, politel^ showinor their papers at the same time. These papers he found in nil cases drawn up regularly. 1 here is no doubt that very soon the French flag will be the only one m use on this coast, giving as it does perfect protection alike to the honest traders and the regular slavers . 220 In sending on the paper to the Secretary of State, the Government of India drew attention to this remark Political a., June 1869, No 9 . 7S-7s.

Regarding the improper use of Secret, Jnne, Nos. 224-228. £y g £ a g g' r jy ar tle Erere Wrote ill 1873—• u Nothing 1 is further from my wish than to throw Her Majesty's Government into a controversy with that of France as to the wisdom or good intentions with which the regulahons for the issuing of the French fla^ were framed. I would wish only to imnress on Her Maiesty's Government that those regulations have, in my opinion, and m the opinion ot those who are perhaps better qualified than myself to judge in such a manner, failed m their object.

The circumstances of the cases were as follows :— 'On 30th December last the protection of this Agency was claimed by an African lad, who stated that he was detained as a slave against his will by a native of India. On sending for the Int'er I ascertained that he was a pu^jact of the State of Jamuneggar in Kathyawar, that he had for some years resided at Nossible in Madagascar, that the vessel in which he camp to Zanzibar was under French colors, and the agreement with the crew (to which com- Noinant was alleged to belong) was drawn up in the presence of the French authorities at plassible, and was then lodged in the French Consulate at this port/' 223. Dr. Kirk applied to the French Consul in the matter, but u received an official reply from M. Guillois in which that gentleman declined to afford me any information on the subject, on the ground that the affair was exclusively a French shipping question in which the authorities of no foreign power had a right to interfere.' 2^4. In a private note M. Guillois wrote :— 1 ai cru devoir officiellement vous ecries la note ei-jointe rraintenant je vous dirai officiensement que la question purement maritime a ete reglee entie la negre et I'lndien quant a I'accusation de Tesclavaore, je nai pas m'ocenpar; le negre et Flndien n'etmit francais ni Turn ni I'autre leconsulat de France n'a pas s'immiscer daus une question de ce geure sur une territoite qui n'est pas francais.' This, as Dr. Kirk remarked, was tantamount to declaring that no obstacle whatever would be placed in the way of Indian subjects running slaves between Madagascar and Zanzibar under the French flag. 2-5.

ARTICLE XXXIII. This authorization granted shall be renewed every year. It can at any time be suspended or withdrawn by the authorities of the power whose colours the vessel carries. (iii) Right of vessels of Native States in India to fly tlie British flag under the operations of the Brussels Act. 227. The above quesition was first raised in 1888, and was finally deter- mined after the Brussels Act had come into force. A clear idea of the position of vessels owned by subjects of Native States is important in order to distinguish the same from that of the French flag-holders. 228. In 1888, in their letter No 1583, dated the 2nd March 1888, the Bombay Government addressed the Gov- internai a., July 1888, Nos. 393-94. ernment of India on the subject of the rights and obligations of the owners and crews of vessels trading with foreign countries, who are subjects of Native States in subordinate alliance with Her Majesty, and made the following suggestions (1) ' The most obvious solution of the difficulty seems to be the distinct recognition of vessels, belonging to the subjects of the maritime or other States in subordinate alliance with Her Majesty, and plying beyond the local limits of those States, as British vessels which must be registered at a British port' . (2) 'In order to enable the Indian Government to provide Indian ships of Native States with the requisite safeguards, it ought to be empowered to issue certificates, such as are issued under Her Majesty's Order in Council at Zanzibar, to the owners of such ships, and this would require fresh legislation 229. The Government of India's reply (No. 2819-L, dated the 11th July 1888) pointed out that the questions discussed appeared to have been raised only in connection with Kutch ships and Kutch subjects and added ' until His Highness the Rao requests that Kutch vessels may be brought under British Indian law, it would seem to the Government of India undesirable to move in the matter of their registration or to take measures with a view to bringing the crews under British jurisdiction.' 230. In Government of India's No. 1064-E., dated the 21st [May 1891, the Bombay Government was asked for their views as to the steps to be taken to of the General Act of the Brussels Conference. The Bombay Governments reply No. 6304, dated the 8th July 1891, referred to the 1888 correspondence and expressed an opinion ' that under Act 32 of the General Act the British Government has no power to authorise a Kutch vessel to carry the British flag, since the Kutch owner is not a protected person in the diplomatic sense intended by the Act.' [Cd73FD] Internal A.&gt; June 1891, Nos. 15—19. carry out the provisions Internal A., October 1891, Kos. 18—29. 5i i H50 231. It was pointed out that the Government of India's letter of the t f a tit qo v v.* &lt;wv oo^ lOth July 1888 contended that Kutob Internal A., July 1888, l^Oi. 43—94 (No. 394). . J , . , j j i i vessels possessed an independent character and reference was also made to its letter No. 8816-1., dated the 25th September 188b, on the subject of an application by Kutch owners for a certificate of naturalisation. In that letter it was suggested that the applicants might be told they were at liberty to avail themselves of the provisions of Section 24 of Act X of ] 841, by giving the command of their vessel to a subject of Her Majesty, and that they might obtain letters of naturalisation by complying with the requirements of Act XXX of 1852. The Bombay Government still desired to recommend the course suggested in 1888 (paragraph 228 above), and said that 'the principle that the sea-board Native States of India in subordinate alliance with Her Majesty should for the purposes of maritime police and external relations be treated as a part of Her Majesty's Indian empire appears worthy of consideration.' 232. Attention was also invited by the Bombay Government to the corres- Secret E., October 1890, No., i-u (Nos. i-i). pondence received from the India Office regarding a desire expressed by the German Government to extend their protection and jurisdiction over such subjects of Indian Native States as were not registered at the British Consulate at Zanzibar and were to be found in the German protected territories in East Africa. In this correspondence Kutch subjects were taken as an instance. Lord Cross's view was that the subjects of any British Indian protected State are under the pro tection of the British Government when out of India. The Bombay Govern ment were of opinion that the provisions of General Act rendered an alteration of Act X of 1841 necessary; they pointed out that the resemblance of the Kutch flag* to the Turkish, Egyptian and Arab ensigns would especially • Red with Bun and moon. invite . visitation of Kutch vessels, and ... or( i er to obtain fair consideration Kutch vessels must hoist the British ensign, and consequently the removal of legal difficulties to that course is the first^step to be taken.' 233. In letter No. 3144, dated the 14th May 1892, the Bombay Govern ment enquired whether, apart from legislation, sanction could not be given to a form of license to carry the British flag. And with their letter, dated the 23rd May 1892, Bombay Government forwarded a communication from the Poli tical Agent, Kutch, regarding proposals by the Kutch Darbar in respect to-— (i) the alteration of the Kutch flag; (ii) amendations of, or additions to, the forms previously used by ship owners, r Farther reports from Kutch were forwarded with the Bombay Govern ment letter No. 3634, dated 4th June 1892, explaining that it was only intended to alter the Kutch flag so as to prevent i.s being mistaken for the Turkish. 2U. The views of the Gorernment of India were expressed in Poreign Secret E., March 1893, Nos. 217-245 (No, 245). Department letter No. 2053.E., dated 7th November 1892 Two aistinct quGstions appear to arise for dGcision, viz, —— ('■) whether rabjects of a Native State in India are 'proteges' of the proteetins Fower within the meaning of Article XXXII of the General Act of the Brnsself Conference in which case permission to % the British Bag, under that article, might be granted to vessels of such Native States ; and (.V) whether our own Municipal Law, as it at present stands, enables us to erant this permission, and if not, what alteration of it is required for the purpose snbjeS ^ z ^ ^ General Act.' protected persons lor the purposes of the As regards the second question, I am to rpmark that ^ i , statutory authority enabling the Government of India to grant permission to^flT *1° P flag m ships, which are not British ships or by persons who Jo n f iTV u ^ - f Bntlsh under the provisions of Act X of 1841, as amended by subsequent enac'tmenffi ndthcr51 does there appear to be any authoritative prohibition of such grants; and I am to add that the question of regulating such grants by the introduction of a clause in the pending Merchant Shipping Bill will be taken into consideration. Meantime there does not seem to be any objection to the grant of such permission in the case of vessels owned by subjects of Native State to which the privileges of a British ship have been, or may hereafter be, granted under the provisions of the Act above mentioned. There is no objection to the proposed alteration of the Kutch flag; but it should be pointed cut to the Davbar that the benefits of the General Act can only be claimed by vessels which not only are authorised to fly the British ftag, but also comply strictly with the provisions of the Act, and that the suggested moditications of those provisions are consequently inadmissible. 235. A form of license to carry tlie British flag was sanctioned in Foreign Department No. 1481-E., dated 9th Secret E , March 1893, N ob . 217-245 (No. 242). 1892, to Satisfy the Conditions of Article XXXII of the Act. (iv) The procedure adopted hy the French in granting French Flags in recent years. 236.

The secret, b., September i9oo, N ob . 5—56 (No. 4i). Captain of a dhow—he may he owner or he may not—during one of his annual voyages with a cargo of dates to the littoral of the Bed Sea or the Indian Ocean on presenting himself at one of the French Consulates on those waters, e.g., Obok, Jibuti, Madagascar, Zanzibar or Camaro Islands, is granted a paper called Titre de navigation ' and a French Flag on the following conditions:— (i) he must buy a house or land in a French Colony, or (ii) he must furnish a suitable personal security in the person of a local French protected resident, who has been in possession of a French Flag for some time previously and has done nothing to disgrace it; (iii) the grant should be renewed every year. The applicant as a rule prefers the personal security, which can easily be secured for nothing. 237. The whole procedure appears to be regulated in order to suit the con ditions of articles XXX—XXX111 of the Brussels Act quoted above, 238. In renewing the grants, it happens frequently that the vessel passes from one owner or captain to a new one, who has come ^ in possession of it by purchase, death of previous owner or captain, or otherwise, so that it has been impossible for the Sultan to say from one year to another, which of his Suri sub jects would or would not claim French protection if occasion arose. (v) Slave trade by Oman vessels flying the French Flag, 1891—1898. 239.

The Political Agent wrote :— ' His Hig-hmess remarked that if they and their boats can be covered by the French flag in his territorial waters, the Fie&amp;ch flag may some day be held to cover their houses and pro- psrty on land. ' 243. In a letter of the same date the Political Agent reported that eight of the principal Sheikhs of the Jenebeh of Sur had stated to him that they had got their French papers from the French Consul at Aden and not from Obokh, and that they had paid a fee of Rs. 40 for each paper.

In May 1892, the Government of India received with Political and Secret Department of the India Office, No. 87, Secret E., July 1892, Nos 56-98. 1 gg2 J two letters from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. The first, a report on the slave trade, dated Basrah, 1st January 1892, stated that he was informed on very good authority that a slave market actually existed at that place, which Europeans were never allowed to see. f ihe letter adds— ' The slaves, as usual, eome up in bugijaWs flying French eleven ° f River nn last year ; the slaves are landed in some ot the numerous creeks of the Shat-el-Arab ive , except a few at Koweit who are driven overland. ' 249. In the second letter, dated 24th January 1893, the same officer writes ' I have the bononr to report that His Highness the Sultan of Maskafc has informed me 1 ^ that the French Consular authorities at Aden Becret E, July 1892, Noi. 56-98, vide No. 90. have depr i ve d the Sur buggalows of their right to fly French colours, so that they have to return to the Arab flag. ' 250. When M. Ottavi was appointed in 1894 French Vice-Consul at Maskat, the Sultan expressed apprehen- Secret E„ February 1895, Nos. 488-453. ^ 0 ^j ec t 0 f the appointment was to assert French protection over French flag-holders. The told by the Government of India that, in the event of the French Co11 putting forward such a claim, the Sultan should be advised to « rtfer to the declaration, dated 10th March 1862, rejecting the indepmdcnce^ and Zanzibar end to inform him that the assertion of French proteo Suris boat in Oman waters would be a contravention of that declaration. 251. These instructions were approved by the Secretary of State for In la, Mr. Fowler, after consulting the Secretary of State for ^ ore l 1 |^.f- flairs ^ tary of State's Despatch Secret No. 48, dated 19th October 1894). 252. In his letter No. 216, dated 26th September 1894, Major Saddler reported after a visit to Sur t , n *• u u The Indian traders, who number seven firms, do not, asm the towns on t e a l ^ e i ne maian inhabit a separate quarter ; their houses are Secret E., Apnllb95,No 3 .5-11. scattered about the to^vn ; they have therefore atr are 6 run'up Z sr^h^U^tr^^VeS^u^X^ m.^.es O^LaU^lytretSinr^l^ Sur^a party of fifty had been landed and despatched northwards as above indicated.

Major Saddler had reason to infer from oareta enqunes that tha maiority of slaves imported into Oman and the Persian Gulf were brought by the Suri ships to Sur at some place near that port. , . , ^ 256. Colonel Wilson observed on this report (No. 73, dated 6th Uoto 'It appears to me that the mischief is by no mrans confin'd * 0 ^nstttnted flag to cover this nefarions traffic in cases when that flag has been gra y y [09731? D] ii54 authority; for the Arabs interested in the trade, being once familiarised with the immunity to be thus secured, would undoubtedly be ready to use the flag even without any right to it, in order to cover their proceedings. Indeed the Sultan's complete impotence and apathy in the matter have hitherto not only prevented his dealing with such of his subjects as have, in spite of his own authority, accepted the French flag, but have rendered hitn uoable even to ascertain with any aocuracy, what vessels belonging to his own subjects have in any formal manner been granted the flag by the French authorities.' 256. The correspondence was forwarded to the Secretary of State (Despatch No. 218-Secret—External, dated 26th December 18y4). 267. We have seen (paragraphs 198—200 above) how in the case of Ali bin Jama, a Baluchi domiciled in Maskat, but who had taken at Bombay a certiticate of naturalization as a British subject in 1868, the question was raised whether the British Consul at Maskat had jurisdiction to try a civil suit tiled against him. If the answer to this question was in the affirmative (aa was the case—though ultimately the man was removed from British Con sular protection), M. Ottavi might quote this (the Sultan asserted he did) an authority for asserting French jurisdiction over Maskat subjects holding Trench flags. There appears however to be an important difference between the two sets of cases. The process of naturalization as o of a Foreign State is admitted by international law. In the case of Ali bin Juma, the question concerned a naturalized British subject. But in case of Maskat subjects flying on their dhows French flags such process of naturalization as a French subject does not appear to have ever been asserted. 258. In 1896 two Suri dhows (the Salaama and the Saad) flying the Secret E., February 1S97, Nos 2S-68. 1 reiich flag With SL CargO of slaVCS OU secietE., July 1897, Nos. 187-222 b oar( i were captured in the territorial waters of the Sultan, but on M. Ottavi's protest, they were surrendered to him, without any questioning of the French jurisdiction over them. The matter was reported to the Secretary of State in Despatch No, 15-Ex., dated 21st January 189/. Her Majesty's Government protested to the French Government against this gross abuse of the French flag and enquired whether the practice of grant ing the French flags still continued. The reply was a disclaimer that there was ever any intention of discontinuing the practice (Secret Despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 12, dated 2nd April 1897). 259. Again, when at the instance of the Government of India, the French Secret e , December 1897, N ob. 98-io3. Government was informed that their atti* tude was inconsistent with their repudia tion of the action of their Vice-Consul at Aden in 1891, the French Ambassador replied that the admission in the case of the Vice-Consul at Aden was not of f^ er ^ 1 application (Despatch from Secretary of State, No. 66-Secret, dated 29th October 1897). 260. In 1897 two further instances occurred (vide Major Fagan's letter secret e., may 1899, nos 692 -721. ^ 0 • dated the 25th November 1897), , . ^ which the British Consul silently ac- quiesced in tbe I rench claim for jurisdiction over Oman subjects lioldintr French flags. In the one case an African slave who had been kidnapped bv a buggalow from Sur flying tlie French flag, having applied to the British f M t f ^ ref e rred to Sultan. Tbe accused was summoned and came to Maskat, but the French Consul interfered and claimed jurisdiction inThe matter Highness was consequently unable to take any action 261 : /l 1 0tlier , cas , e ' native of Maskat, who had procured French papers at Ohokh, was asked by the Sultan to produce tbera, and, on his refusing to do so, was confined in the Sultan's prison. The French Vice-Consul protest ed against his arrest, and tlie Sultan was compelled to release him. 202. The case of Salim-bin-Saud marked a change in the policy of the Resident's No. 78, dated IFth December 1898. British Consul. In this PMSP a roIHei'rm Secret E., PeW y 1 898 , Nos.

Ottavi, who sent the complainant to the British Consul.55 Major Fagan finding that Salim-bin-Saud was a native of Sur, and that the collision occurred in Maskat territorial waters, informed M. Ottavi that, in view of the question pending between Her Majesty's Government and the French Republic regarding the right of France to exercise jurisdiction within the Sultan's dominions over subjects of His Highness, who had obtained the right to fly the French flag, he ' only accepted M. Ottavi's claim on behalf of Salim-bin-Saud, on the understanding that such acceptance should not be considered to prejudice the question at issue between the two Governments. ' No exception was taken to Major Fagan's action at the time : but when the question was referred to the Government of India again in the following year, a stronger line was adopted, Letter No. ioi2- e. a., dated 14th May 1900, to and Captain Cox was informed that, the Resident. ^ should the French Consul again claim secret e., september i9oo, Nos. 5-5o. jurisdiction in any similar case, his claim should not be even provisionally admitted, but should be contested in each case. 263. In 1898 the Foreign Office suggested that the Sultan should adopt a distinctive flag for the use of his subjects. The Political Agent thought that this would be productive of no good unless we assured the Sultan our active support in asserting his authority over his subjects holding French flags. The Government of India urged that steps should be taken for discontinuance of the grant of French flags (Secret Despatch No. 59, dated 31st March 1898). 264. Lord Salisbury however pointed out that we had no unimpeachable locus standi to make this claim in case Secret E, March 1899, Nos. 692-721 (No. 715). of ^ in(iependent state like Maskat, seeing that we had received no request from the Sultan to do so, that the correspondence between the Sultan and the French Vice-Consul showed that the practice of granting French flags had been acquiesced in by His Highness and his predecessors, that in case of our insisting on the abandonment of the French flag, the French Vice-Consul would have an occasion to represent to the Sultan that it would place the Suri vessels at the mercy of the British cruisers and cripple their trade. There was thus some likelihood of the Sultan openly announcing that the flag had been granted with his permission. In these circumstances an order of the Sultan directing his subjects to carry a distinctive Maskat flag would place us in a position to refuse to recognize the validity of the French grants with Maskat territory (Secretary of State's Despatch to the Government of India, No. 4i0 -Secret, dated 30th December 1898). [For subsequent history see Chapters XVII and XX, post,]57 CHAPTEE XV. Introductory Eemarks. 265. It was in the year 1798 that the first treaty was concluded with the Imam of Maskatbythe East India Company's agent at Bushire, pledging mutual friendship, as also hostility against ememies of either, and providing that while France and England were at enmity, no place to ' fix or seat them selves' should he given to the Erench in the Maskat dominions, wherein they had been seeking for a place of vantage to facilitate an attack on India. In a hundred years since then, the same question of the Erench gaining a foothold in Maskat territory and prepondering influence with the Sultan reached a critical phase. The political predominance, which the British had gained during a hundred years by saving the power of the Al Bu Saids especially the branch of Sayyid Said (1804—1856) from being completely crippled, by subsidizing the Sultans and by establishing a commerce between Oman and the outside world, virtually in the hands of Indians : such a position was threatened in consequence of toolish resentment, baseless suspicions,^ forget- fulness of berefits received, driving a thoughtless and weak Sultan into the hands of a Power; who had never risked a ship, man or gun for the security of the Sultanate, whose commercial interests in the country were comparatively insignificant; who sought to establish an imperium in imperio in the Sultan's dominions by a fictitious manufacture of Erench protected persons out of His Highness' own subjects themselves and setting them off against the Sultan's rule ; whose intrigues in Oman had for their main object the establish ment of a naval base which w r ould serve the Erench and the Russians to deal a death blow to British influence in the Persian Gulf and the Indian seas. The British predominance, the natural growth of a century, essential for Maskat's very existence as an independent power, was in danger of being exchanged for the artificial growth of a few years, as Erench influence was. 266. At such a juncture, then, we were entitled to make a bold stand and claim to set back the situation to a status ante quo by taking prompt and vigorous measures, even using force, it necessary, on the ground that our political and commercial connection with Maskat was of so long a standing, that our influence was so overwhelmingly predominent over that of all other powers put together, that we were bound to maintain it, not merely as a matter of equity, but on account of its necessity for the defence of our Indiau Empire. 267. We shall briefly trace the history of this connection and growth of in fluence. Eirst of all at the commencement Nejd Precis, 1804—190i, sections v and vi. ^ 29th century when the Joasmi and other tribes in North Oman were conquered by the Wahabis and drawn into a system of piracies in the Persian and Oman seas, and M^askat, also threatened by the 'Wahabis, was on the point of being conquered and drawn into this vortex, the British expeditions against the Joasmis and other Oman tribes, first in 1809- 11 and then in 1819-20, saved the Oman coasts from passing for ever under Wahabi dominion. It is true Maskat aided the British with its fleet and provisions; but it must be noted that while the British could have dispensed with that aid, Maskat could not have saved itself without our aid. 268. Consistently with their policy, the British confined their operations to the sea. But these naval operations by themselves were sufficient to keep back the Wahabis from the coast. Moreover, the very presence of a large number of British Indian merchants in the ports of the Maskat coast, was calculated to exercise a wholesome check on the Wahabis and Arab marauding spirit extending to the coast. On the other hand, the British policy of non-interference in the internal tribal conflicts, or the Wahabi raids in the interior, though sought frequently by the Sultans of Maskat, preserved the position of the Sultans as independent rulers and the whole country passing into the hands of the British^ [C973ED]58 269.

In 1862, when during the absence of Sayyid Said, Abdullah bin Faisal invaded Oman with a large Wahabi force, it was through the intervention of the British Resident at Bushire, that the Wahabi Amir was induced to return on an agreement to pay a tribute, instead of ceding Sohar and other territory which had been demanded and could have been easily gained by the Wahabis. 270. On the death of Sultan Sayyid Said, his dominions were saved from a fearful civil war by the interference of the Government of India, as a result of which Zanzibar and Maskat became separated as independent States, a result which would probably have been brought about in the ordinary course of events but at great cost of money and bloodshed. The amicable settlement of Lord Can ning in 1861 provided the Maskat Treasury with an annual subsidy of 40,000 crowns from Zanzibar and when Maskat found it impossible to secure the regular payment of this subsidy except by a costly war in which Maskat could hardly be expected to succeed, the British Government stepped in and undertook to pay it themselves, for no other consideration than Zanzibar and Maskat joining in the anti-slave crusade. This was in the year 1873. The subsidy was guaranteed to the then Sultan of Maskat—Sayyid Turki, ' so long as he continued faithful to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Government.' 271. We should not forget to mention the vigorous British operations Nejd Precis, iFOi— 1904, section xxvi. against the Wahabis in 1865-66 under Colonel Pelly which, though undertaken to punish their outrages against British Indian subjects, saved the Maskat State from almost total extinction. In the agreement concluded, after these operations, by Amir Abdullah bin Faisal, he agreed that— ' henot injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially the Kingdom of Muskat, further than in receiving the zukat that has been customary of old.' 272. For a further resume of the history of the political connection of the Secret e., March 1899, Nos. 104-212 (No. 210). Biitish with Maskat, we cannot do better than extract the following passages from the despatch of the Government of India to the Secretary of State, No 38 dated 2nd March 1899^ ^ » ' It appears indeed that, since the time of Saiyid Said, no Sultan of Maekat has been able e ectively to establish his position without obtaining the recognition of the British Govern- ment; while there is nothing to show that any other foreign Government has ever been applied to for a similar recognition. Throughout this period the Government of India have on several occasions been called upon to intervene in the dynastic disputes of the Maskat Mate Claimants or pretenders have been interned in India, have been prevented from attacking a reigning Sultan, have been given allowances, and have been otherwise dealt with in ^r rer '^ 0SSe, ^i S1 'T^ ^ '' eco g mse d and effective supremacy, could claim to act.

'Teazer' went to his assistance, defended the town of Maskat from the sea, and caused the rebels to retire. The Dutch Treaty with Maskat is tell: au evidence of British supremacy; for the Dutch Consul at Bushn-e 'n 1837 requested the British Resident's co-operation in negotiating it. the Captain of the Netherland's corvette ' Batavia,' who was iu charge of the trSaty, 1ft it in the Resident s hands, and Colonel Pn leanx sent it to the Political Affenl at Masl-at tn negofate w.th the Sultan.

There is no recognized law of succession in Maskat. Saiyid Faisal was not the eldest son of his fathor and there was a fonnifiable rival in the field in the person of his uncle, Sayyid Abdul Aziz. For a time the British Government withheld its formal recognition of a sovereign as to whose qualifications serious doubts were entertained ; but from the date of his formal assumption of power, the subsidy of Rs. 86,400 a year, which had been paid to his father, was continued to hioi, and it is no exaggeration to say that by these means alone was he enabled to consolidate his position, When he was finally recognised in 1890, he intimated his intention to maintain to the full the same relations as had existed with the British Government in the time of his father, and to act up t» all the engagements undertaken by his father and predecessors in the government of Maskat. He then pledged himself in a formal assurance to the following effect: ' It is my earnest desire to be guided in all important matters of policy by the advice of the British Government, and to so conduct the government as to secure the continued friendship and approbation of the Viceroy and the British Govern- ment.^ Relying upon this assurance, thn British Government have ever since deterred Sayyid Abdul Aziz, who subsequently retired to India, from attempting to revive dynastic trouble in Oman. In 1894-95 when there was a rebellion in Maskat against the authority of Sultan Sayyid Faisal, the Government of India warned Sheik Abdudlah-bm-Saleh to cease from attack ing the Sultan, and they authorised His Highness in November 1895 to issue a notification warning the leading Sheikhs of Oman that, whatever differences they might have in future with the Sultan, the Government of India would not allow them to attack towns of Maskat and Muttra. Further, the Government of India gave to the Saltan their countenance and support when the people of Dhofar rebelled against him, and they enabled him to put an end to that uprising. 4. This catalogue of services rendered by the British Government to successive rulers of Maskat and notably to the present occupant of the throne, the annual 'payment oj a subsidy contingent upon the loyal fulfilment of treaty obligations, and the history of the influence thereby exercised by Great Britain for a period of nearly half a century upon the fortunes of the State, at once explain and justify the existence of a positive political predominance on the part of Great Britain, that is shared by no other Power in the affairs of Maskat. White not compromis- inn the independence of its sovereign, which both the British and French Governments have re' ciprocally bound themselves, by an undertaking in they tar 1862, to respect, this condition of affairs has yet been the inevitable outcome of the physical situation of the country, of its con tiguity to the shores of India, and of its close proximity to the waters of the Persian Gulf, in which British interests, political and commercial, have, throughout the present century, exercised so commanding an influence. In the ports and territory of Maskat itself, this predominance has been accentuated by the facts that the trade of the British dominions with Maskat amounts to about fths of the entire trade of the country; that the latter is almost exclusively in the hands of Indian traders, who are British subjects; that the commerce and interesters of any other country are relatively quite insignificant; that the share of the trade enjoyed by the three other Powers with whom Maskat has direct treaty relations, viz., America, France and Holland, amounts, if added together, to less than T Vth of the entire trade of the country, while that of France, so far as can 'be judged from the Customs returns of the past two years, consists of one item only, namely, the importation of arms and ammunition, valued in 1896 and 1897, respectively, at 50,000 and 100,000 dollars. Great Britain, moreover, is the only nation which has telegraphic interests on the coasts of Oman ; while the police of its seas has been exercised for many years past by Her Majesty's ships alone. The relations of amity ami of. political ascendancy which have been above recorded, and which have brought the State of Maskat within what may legitimately be described as the sphere of British political influence, culminated in 1891 in an agreement voluntarily entered into by the present Sultan, and following immediately upon the conclusion of a new Com mercial Treaty between Great Britain and Maskat, by which he undertook never to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the dominions of Maskat and Oman or any of their dependencies. 5 Such was the state of affairs in Oman, until, at a more recent date, the Sultan began' to evince an inclination to depart from the friendly attitude, which had hitherto been observed both by his predecessors and by himself. He appeared to be more anxious to court the favours of France—who had established a Vice-Consulate at Maskat m 1894—than to abide by his eno-agement; and to be unmindful of the extent to which his ability to maintain his position depencte upon the pecuniary assistance and the support of the British Government. His Highness has acquiesced— after some preliminary remonstrance—in the practice which has recently been introduced of granting French protection within his own dominions to his own subiects who may have dealings with the French,—a practice which, while open to objec tion on many grounds, is gravely to be deprecated when it gives the protection of the French flag to Arab dhows, engaged in slave-running in Maskat waters, not merely as impugning the Sultan's authority, but also as interfering with the efforts so long and consistently directed by Great Britain to the extirpation of the traffic in slaves on the waters ©f the Indian Ocean.v jf I m 60 CHAPTER XVI. Causes of Sayyid Faisal's Hostility to the British. 273. Sayyid Faisal never appears to have been well disposed towards the British from the very first. As early as 1891, Colonel Mockler, Political Agent, Maskat, reported very unfavourably of his ways, and described him as ' impa- Secret E.. July 1891, Nos. 66-70. ^ tient of the obligations attached to the vide also paragraph 2 Chapter i of this Precis, position of a sovereign under treaty en gagements ' (Demi-official of Colonel Mockler to Major Talbot, dated 0th March 1891). 274. *Our failure to assist him in turning out the rebels out of Maskat and Matra and afterwards making him responsible for the compensation claimed for the loss caused to the British Indians, seem to have been deeply resented by him. fWhen the A1 Kathiris rose in rebellion in Dhofar in 1895, the Sultan evinced no readiness to accept our assistance, probably because he suspected our motives, and though he acknowledged our services in suitable terms, it is doubtful whether the gratitude he expressed was a genuine one. Further the officious and uncalled for interest taken by Major Fagan in a sequel of this rebellion must have gone far to strengthen his suspicions against the British policy. It will be necessary to go into some details of the incident in question to under stand the position. 275. The insurrection of the A1 Kathiri tribe in Dhofar was led by Sheikh Salim bin Hamad-al-Mahruni and his cousin Sheikh Umar-bin-Abdullah-al- Mahruni. In this rising a son of the Vali Suleiman-bin-Suveilim was killed. The expedition sent by the Sultan failed to recover Dhofar, and it was only in 1897, when the Maskat forces aided by the presence of H.M.S. Cossack and the ii.I.M.S. Lawrence by sea and the intervention of Colonel Wilson and Captain Beville, that matters were arranged and peace was restored. It appears that a promise of pardon was made to the rebels m the name of the Sultan by his brother Sayyid Mahomed Turki. These assurances of pardon were confirmed by Colonel Wilson and Captain Beville, and Colonel Wilson urged the rebels to submission relying on these promises and his good offices with His Highness in their favour. 276. In May 1898 Sheikh Salim was arrested and imprisoned, probably at Secret e ., November 1898, No,. 206-227. mstigatiou of Vali Suleiman in revenge for the murder of his son. When Major Fagan heard of this arrest he asked the Sultan on 12th May the cause thereof. His Highness replied that it was for certain transgressions that had been reported against him. Major Fagan then reminded the Sultan of the promises made for the pardon of the rebels and said (letter dated 1st May)— ' Unless therefore Your Highness is able to show that Salim-bin-Hamad-al-Mahruni had committed some specific criminal offence since the time of the restoration of Dhofar to Your Highness, I must a&amp;k Your Highness to release the Sheikh at once'' 277. The Sultan replied that the Sheikh had committed offences, which had led to bloodshed and that the security given no more applied. Major Fagau Major Faganto Colonel Meade, No. 208, dated thereupon visited the Sultan in his uniform 26th May i8y8. ^ an( j re iterated his demand, and when His Highness stated that the Sheikh stood charged with a serious offence com mitted after the restoration of Dhofar, the Political Agent insisted on a public enquiry being held, which the Sultan did not consider necessary. 2/8. Soon after Sheikh Umar was also arrested and thrown into prison, on some other charge. Major Fagan thought that the charges were concocted by W ali Suleiman and asked Colonel Meade for authority to demand the release of the two Sheikhs (letter No. 238, dated 25th June 1898). Colonel Meade, however, thought that Colonel Wilson's statements to the Dhofar rebels did not amount to a guarantee of the Sultan's promises or engagement to protect them from oppression. Any such guarantee or engagement would have requir- ed the sanction of the Government of In dia and consent of the Sultan, as they • Vide Chapter V ante. t Vide Chapter VIII ante.fu} 61 would be tantamount to direct interference between His Higlmess and his subjects. Colonel Meade, therefore, proposed to refer the matter to Govern ment with what Major Eagan had to say on the matter (letter No. 279, dated 20th July 1898). 279. Major Fagan considered the case an exceptional one requiring exceptional treatment. In submitting the correspondence to Government, Colonel Meade observed that he was afraid that Major Eagan had not obtained sufficiently trustworthy information so as to justify the inference that the Sultan had proceeded against the two Sheikhs in violation of any promises Colonel Wilson and Captain Beviile might have given to the people of Dhofar. Colonel Meade thought that the only assurance given was to the effect first that the leading men and others who had come in would be free to return unmolested and that the British authorities would use their good offices to ensure the safety and good treatment of all who submitted. He, therefore, proposed to inform Major Fagan to exercise his good offices on behalf of the Sheikhs ) but to abstain from direct interference in their behalf or other inhabitants of Dhofar without a previous reference to Government and generally to avoid making irritating demands, in which the Government of India might not be able to support him (letter No. 44-S.-A., dated 7th August 1898). 280. Tbe Government of India concurred generally in Colonel Meade's views and suggestion, and added (No. 14569-E., dated 18th October 1898):— ' Th© importance of adopting a conciliatory attitude towards tlie Sultan and of endea vouring in every possible manner t-o gain His Highness s confidence should be strongly ini' pressed on Major Fagan.' 281. Acting upon this advice, when Major Eagan visited the Sultan on 13th December, he congratulated His secret e., march 1899. nob. 4.12. Highness on his approaching marriage with the sister of Sheikh Ibrahim-bin-Kais, and suggested that such an occasion would be a fitting one for the exercise of clemency towards the two Sheikhs. The Sultan was pleased to release them the next day. 282. Had Major Fagan displayed this tact previously, he need not have roused the resentment and hostility of the Sultan by the arrogant tone he adopted towards His Highness in demanding the release of tlie Sheikhs, which was very ill advised at a time when the Sultan was known to regard the British with much suspicion and to have thrown himself in the arms of the French. It was the belief, moreover, of Major Eagan that the Sultan had never relished the necessity of the British intervention in the rebellion of Dhofar, as he feared it might lead to the British taking Dhofar under their protection. Major Pagan's recent proceedings must therefore have gone far to strengthen his suspicions. 283. At the same time we find M. Ottavi, the French Consul, skilfully feedina- the Sultan^ suspicions of the British motives and doing every thing to increase his impatience of the British control. M. Ottavi was not slow in again and a^ain reminding the Sultan of the great service done by the French to Maskat by the declaration of 1862, which secured his dominions independence from British intrigues.^ The Sultan was shrewd enough to see that he could easily play the British against the French, and this he did as we shall see hereafter. ( i [osmFP]62 CHAPTEE XVII. Manifestations of French Activity and Sayyid Faisal's Hostility to the British. (i) French protection extended to Maskat subjects flying the French flag on their dhows. 284. While the Sultan was growing impatient of the British preponderance in Maskat, the French found it easy more largely than ever to have recourse to a bold device to introduce their imiperium in imperio in His Highness's dominions. There being few French subjects or natives of countries under their protection in Maskat dominions, they proceeded to manufacture French protected persons out of the Sultan's own subjects : for the mere consideration of the Arabs—especially those at Sur—paying the price of a hut or plot of ground in Obokh, Jibuti or Madagascar, which perhaps never existed or has never been seen by them, or the security of a local French protected resident, the French granted them papers which not only entitled them to carry French flags on their dhows and to claim French protection in the broad seas, but on which they sought and succeeded in obtaining the French protection in the Sultan's territory. 285. We have already given a history of the practice up to the year 1898 in Chapter XIV. 5e86. From Major Fagan's report to Colonel Meade, No. 401, dated 31st October 1898, it appears that in May 1898, the Sultan was prevailed upon by the Vazir Sayyid Said to commence correspondence with Mons. Ottavi regard ing the question of jurisdiction over Suri dhows flying the French flag. The French Vice-Consul resented the opening of this inconvenient question and urged the dismissal of Sayyid Said as being unfit on account of the latter's bias towards the British, to give an impartial decision to the Sultan in matters on which both the governments were concerned. We shall find that by the end of the year this pressure brought about the downfall of the unfortunate Minister. 287. These French papers have been given chiefly to the inhabitants of Sur including a large number of the Jenebeh tribe. The Arab tribes of the place are not very loyal subjects of the Sultan, being in many respects autono mous. Yet they acknowledge him as their chief, pay him certain duties, and are admitted as his subjects. An idea had grown up that the Arab vessels flying the French colours are secure from all interference, even from the British, never mind what traffic they might be carrying on. While calculated to weaken our influence over Oman, the extensive grant of this French privilege did much more to undermine the Sultan's power. Yet His Highness at first either was hardly in a position to oppose the practice : so completely had he gradually passed under M. Ottavi's influence. (ii) Employment of Abdul Aziz by both the Sultan and French Consul as a medium of consultation. 288. In bringing the Sultan to this helpless condition, M. Ottavi found an able instrument in one Abdul Aziz, who had been exercising a commanding influence in Maskat in the French interests. 289. Abdul Aziz, an intriguing and mischievous character, and AngVphobe Major Fagan's memoranda dated 4th and 6th No* ^ dismissed^ il 'Om the Zanzibar vember and 12th December 1898. service m 1893. While at Zanzibar he had Secret E., March 1899, Noa. 722-777 (Noa. 746, been an intimate friend of M. Ottavi, 747aIld748) - and then a dragoman in the French Con- TaWramf fv v . .. q . , sulate. In 1893, he went to Maskat, where state. dated 2is?MarciTi899° y to tlie Seoretary of ^ was employed as a Munshi by the Sul- Btd, No. 773. ^ a 1 n . on a monthly salary of 25 dollars, iqoq t i cn 1 nr . which he received regularly till October 1898. In 1894, M, Ottavi came as French Vice-Consul to Maskat, and with the63 Sultan 's permission entertained Abdul Aziz as a dragoman of the Consulate. He thus held a dual employment under the Sultan and M. Ottavi, which was well utilised for frequent consultations between the two through his medium in matters on which the British interests were involved. Many a letter from the Sultan to the British Consul was found to be in the handwriting of Abdul Aziz, and there was no doubt that he read the letters written by the British Consul to the Sultan and communicated their contents to the Freneh Consul. He was in fact the confidential adviser of the Sultan as well as the French Consul. 290. When Major Fagan mentioned the fact of this dual employment to M. Ottavi, the latter expressed astonisliment and said, that if lie were really employed by the Sultan as a Munshi, be would request the Sultan to cease to employ Abdul Aziz in that capacity. 291. When the Sultan was asked whether Abdul Aziz was in his employ he denied the fact; but there was absolutely no doubt that he received a salary of 25 dollars per month from the Sultan from November 1895 to October 1898, while stiil in the service of the French Consulate. 292. In his letter No. 60, dated 7th November 1898, Colonel Meade asked the Government of India for orders to Sscret E., r .br..,, X899. N,,. 90.189. urge ^ {rom h j 3 Abdul Aziz, as his continuance therein would be inimical to the maintenance of friendly relations between the British Government and His Highness. In his letter No. 61, dated 7th November, Colonel Meade, after reviewing the his tory of the British connection with Maskat, and of the recent ascendancy gained by the French, expressed his opinion that the best solution of the diffi culty would be to induce the French Government to agree to the abrogation of the Treaty of 1862, but that short of it, we should not make it clear to the Sultan that we had no designs against him, but were on the contrary desirous to improve the condition of his state and himself; that we should not interfere with the rebellious Sheikhs in Dhofar and Sur, beyond using our good offices to bring about a reconciliation. 293. In regard to these two letters of Colonel Meade, Lord Elgin telegraph ed to the Secretary of State on 20th December 1898— 'I presume Her Majesty 's Government wish to avoid complications with France, and would therefore wish Colonel Meade to be instructed to abstain from supporting the Sheikh and conciliate the Sultan.' (iii) Omission of the Sultan to hoist the British flag on the Ist of January 1898. 294,. On arrival of Colonel Meade and Major Fagan at Maskat in the Law rence early morning 1st January 1898,the Secret e .. April 1898, Nos. 203-204. Sultan fired 31 guns from the fort, but did not hoist the British flag. The omission was not noticed at the time. The two officers not being on deck they assumed it was the salute hitherto fired on the 1st January, in honour assumption of title of Empress of India by Her Majesty the Queen. Colonel Meade received afterwards a formal visit of the Sultan under the impression that it was also in honour of the same anniversary. Subsequent ly, however, Colonel Meade was informed that the Sultan had intentionally not hoisted the flag to show that he did not consider he was connected with the Indian Government. ' It was reported that he had been instigated to do this by the French Consul, that it had created an impression unfavourable of our prestige. The Sultan was asked for an explanation. He replied that the salute had been a New Year's day compliment to all Christian nations, not as a compliment to the Queen-Empress. He was then informed that the stopping of a compliment always hitherto accorded could only be regarded as an unfriendly act and that a salute must be fired at once with the British flag flying all day according to custom. He complied with the request and the salute was fired on the morning of 3rd January, the flag flying all day. It was considered desirable also to make him further express regret in writing that he had omitted compliment at proper time, and to give assurances that the occasion would be properly observed in future, which was done. Colonel Meade thought that the Sultan of64 Maskat had come to be much under French influence, and it was improbable that he would readily consent to our proposal regarding arms, customs, et unless we took stronger line than hitherto adopted and that we should impress upon him our interests are paramount, and that he must attend to our advice. 295. The above facts were reported by Colonel Meade by telegram dated 5th January 189S, and on 8th January 1898, the following message was tele graphed to him by the Government of India :— 'Your aciion is approved, but please remember that, in view of French activity, Her Majesty's Government especially desire to maintain friendly relations with, as well as influence over Sultan. You should, therefore, do your utmost to secure his confidence and good will. You might remind him of assistance we have given in financial matters and at Dhofar ' (iv) Outrages against British Naval officers by Sultan's employes. 296. On 28th January 1898, Lieutenants Brandon and Sterling and Gun- m ^ , .

Taufik-bin-Ali, another Sultan's ofiicial, arrived on the scene. The three British officers were thereupon taken in custody to the palace and there released. The Political Agent arrived at Maskat on the 31st and succeeded in getting Kibrit publicly flogged on 5th February, while the two of the Sultan's officials were marched off in irons to the jail. The latter two were released on 10th April at the Agent's request. 297. What is important to note here that such a daring proceeding on the part of Sultan's servants would hardly have been possible in Maskat, unless the atmosphere in the Sultan's palace was charged with a considerable anti-British feeling. The Sultan too was found very reluctant to inflict a public punishment for a most wanton insult to British officers, which was so open, and consider able pressure had to be brought to bear upon His Highness, before be could be induced to punish the culprits in the manner described. (v) Visit of French gunboats to Maskat and Sultan's warm welcome to the French Commander. 298. A French gunboat, the Gahes, arrived at Maskat in February 1898, and as it was afterwards found, it was on the occasion of this visit that an agreement dated 7th March following was entered into by the Sultan to give the French a place for a coal depot in his dominions with right to flv the French flag and fortify the place (vide paragraphs 319-823 post.) 2J9. On 7th October 1898, the French steamer Scorpion arrived at Maskat.

On the 24th October, the Sultan presented the Commander of the Scorpion with one sjold mounted sword of honour, six gold coffee cup stands, two lar^e silver trays, besides the usual present of halwa and fruit.

The Jenebeh f\ eS f°W verv indignant. On the same day Suleiman left Sur, leaving his son l^ ivr 13 years' old' in charge of the Governorship. Soon after tms joy ,hW under instructions of the Sultan—began to bulla a new fort commanding the water-supply of the town as well as the caravan route to the interior. This and other high-handed acts so incensed the Jenebeh tribesmen 805. ims an o epptinn^ combined and memorialized the Sultan that their four fakhaids ^ _ d the stopping of the fort; but no notice demanding removal of bu i turned a deaf year to a deputation uk.. ^ 1 that waited for him on ^t y to the Sultan and obtained orders trom .I-» removal of Suleiman s son. [C973I , D] i-66 306. On 26th September 1898, news was received that the Jeneheh had cut off supplies of the garrison of the old fort. On the 4th October, 600 of the Jenebeh tribe, with 150 Beni Rahsib and 200 Beni Bu Ali attacked the old fort, which surrendered on condition tbat the garrison with the GoverDor's son were sent to Maskat. Works of the new fort were also destroyed. The Jenebeh refused to admit the new Governor sent by the Sultan—Hamid bin Saif— until the British Government gave a guarantee against re-appointmenfc of Suleiman and directed customs farmer to withhold customs (but not punitive tax) from the Sultan. Mahomed-bin-Hamid was, however, able to take peaceable possession on 2. p )th November of the old fort, which was found disman tled except the bare walls. 307. What is important to note in connection with the French intrigues in this case is that when once the Sultan decided to commence hostilities against the Jenebeh, a letter was drafted informing the British Consul of the fact and requesting him to warn the British subjects to leave Sur. But Abdul Aziz prevailed upon the Sultan to sign a similar letter to the French Consul, which, as shown by the Vazir Sayyid, Said would have the effect of acknowledging that the Sultan's subjects, flying the French flag, were under French protection while residing in his dominions. The letter was then, in the absence of the Abdul Aziz, so worded as to show that the notice was only intended for bond fide French subjects who might happen to be at Sur. As, however, there were no such^ subjects at all at Sur, the letter might be understood as a tacit recognition of the French protection over certain of the Sultan's subjects. (viii) Refusal of the Sultan to accept a British Official to manage the Customs. SOS. The administration of Oman had been for many years in a chaos. The secret e., march 1899, nos. 60-65. restless Arab tribes in the interior could Meade ' No - 62 - A ' dated not be kept under the least check by His „ . . ... Highness. He could pacify them for a time by oiiering subsidies. For the funds for this purpose he depended partly upon the British subsidy and partly upon loans borrowed from the Banias. He was indebted to the Banias to the extent of nearly 190,000 dollars at the commencement of the year 1898. Further he obtained advances from the far mers of the Customs—Katansi Purshotam and others—on the securitv of the customs. J 309. The Government of India advanced the Sultan a loan of Rs. 60,000 See Chapter VII, ante, in June 1897 with the special object of i • 'x x - enabling His Highness to repav debts beanng exorbitant interest. But a large portion of this was diverted by the Sultan for his own personal use. 31°. With a fair and careful administration of the customs, the revenue therefrom could be almost doubled and the Sultan would be tree from his in! debteduess to the Ban,as. The Government of India offered the services of a tL 'lV^tefr :e of fntmim' rpr|fe ' 13111 tlu - offer was declined by the Sultan, as the system of farming was a convenient one and enabled him to obtain advances from the farmers whenever he wanted loans. 311. Major Fagan was therefore of opinion that the Government of India should advance loans to the Sultan not on the security of the subsidv but on that of the customs, and that the subsidy also should be stopped as long as he continued to remain obdurate on the question of the customs S « 3 ! 2 ;. Tl : e , questioa was als0 raise ' i whether, it the Sultan of Maskat could swlei e.,'m«'h i899,'HoTe l M6.' 56 induced to give to the Government of this course could be held to infringe the proWsio^Tf T'T'' llTjanna^'lMsf 11 I^L Ys Ma r ch1862 (Viceroy's telegram'dated oontrrf of the Si's ^ ft compatible with the independence of the 801^0° MasLt Ir l S r areel - V b , e by the Declaration in/question and would certafn y t Ve L to ~ trances on the part of the French Government. It wasf hfweve'^0^';67 some arrangement might be made for the employment of a British official 'by the Sultan to superintend the customs, which might give the same security for good administration without being open to objection on the part of Erench. An advance of money to the Sultan on the security of the customs might form part of such an arrangement. But the officer superintending the customs administration should ostensibly at least be the Sultan s officer while so em ployed (Foreign Office to India Office, dated 7th February 1898). Even this modified proposal was not acceptable to the Sultan. (Ix) Excessive Export and Import duties levied on British Indian subjects. 313. Under article 7 of the Treaty of 1891, 'No export duties are to be levied on goods exported from those (Mas- External A., May 1899, N ob . 1-12. terr i tor j es exC ept with the Consent of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty.' As a matter of fact, however, 5 per cent, ad valorem duty was levied from British Indian subjects, who exported dry and wet dates from the Oman coast. This practice has been a long standing one. The question of the legality of this tax was raised in 1885, but it was apprehended that the language of the Treaty of 1839, which was in force then, was ambiguous, and the Government of India decided that though these internal duties levied upon the country produce which is being brought to the coast for exportation were practically export duties, *• it was not necessary to make any stipulations in regard to them, provided that British subjects were not treated worse in this respect than Maskat subjects or than the subjects of the most-favoured nation ^ 314. In 1898, from Major Pagan's report it appeared that not only the full Major Fagan to Colonel Meade. duty of 5 per Cent. OU d .teS exported Was No. 288, dated 27th July 1898. levied solely from British subjects, while some Arab tribes were wholly and others were partly free from this duty, but that an additional punitive tax of 5 per cent was levied on dates grown by the tribes residing at certain places (Bostak and Wadi Mawal), which duty as a matter of fact fell on the Indian traders, who had already bought the dates. 314-A. The view taken by Lord Curzon was— (1) that the 5 per cent, ad valorem duty might be permitted though illegal, but (2) that beyond that we should not humour an illegality, and (3) that the British subjects should not be forced to pay even the 5 per cent, duty where the natives are spared the exaction. 315 In his despatch (No. 7, dated 19th November 1898) to the address of the Secretary of State, Foreign Affairs, secret e., March 1899, N ob. 49-59. Major Fagan reported that besides dates heavv export duties were levied on tobacco (20 per cent.), dried fish and other articles—the products of Oman (6 to 7 per cent.), that besides duties were levied when articles were conveyed from one part to another on the Oman coast. The import duties levied were also frequently in excess of those allowed. Ihe blame for this rested partly on the Bania farmers of the customs and partly on the Sultan, who depended upon them for advances of loans on the security of the customs, and allowed the Banias a free hand. 316 In order to check these abuses. Major Fagan thought that the best course would be for himself to exercise a control of the customs farmed as they were bv British subjeots»and enforce a due observance by them of articles 6, 7 and 10 of the Treaty of 1891 (19th March), by issuing regulations under Article I of the Maskat Order in Council of 1867. These regulations published on 21st November 1898 provide— (1) that the farmers of the customs, being British subjects, should furnish the British Consul with a copy of the terms of the farming contract;68 (2) that no British subjects should collect or agree to collect customs in contravention of articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of 1891, or (3) in contravention of article 10, so as to obstruct or delay transit of goods; (4) that the British Consul shall be sole judge as to what constitutes delay in furnishing copy of the agreement, and what taxes are illegal, etc.; (5) that infraction of the above rules shall be punished with a maximum fine of 500 dollars or 3 months' imprisonment. 3J 7. These Eegulations were issued on the assumption that the Customs „ „ . ^ ^ „, ,' „ farmer is in no sense a servant of the See Foreign UopHrtment letter to Colonel Meade, £&gt;.-ii »» iiiij-i ^ i ?o. 153 e .a , dated aist January 1899.

They constituted Major Fagan the sole arbiter of what were the proper taxes and empowered him to enforce them according to his lights, while if ever they were found to be improper or illegal, the remedy properly lay in a representation to the Sultan through the usual diplomatic channel. It would moreover be impossible to work them in practice, as a Benami arrangements were possible and would be difficult to prove in a Court of Justice. Further the Regulations were ill-considered and impolitic, inasmuch their enforcement might drive the customs farming into foreign hands, such as a French Syndicate. Lord Curzon therefore thought that Major Fagan's proceedings was inexpedient. 318. The Secretary of State himself had doubts as to their expediency, and Telegram from Vieeroy to Secretary of State, ^ tlllS Opinion XiOld CurZOU COUCUrred and dated 19th January 1899 thought that they should not have been Secret E., Marsh 1399, Nos 49-59. • „ , i j. e x xi tt issued without reference to the Home or Indian Government. As, however, they had been promulgated for two months and in operation for one month.

A., dated 31st January 1899.) (x) Grant cf Eunder Jisseh to the French. 319. Meanwhile a report had appeared in the French papers that the Sultan Secret E., February 1899, Nos. 90-189 (No. 134). leased Bunder ' GeSSCh ' to the b rench for a coaling station. The Secretary of State enquired by telegram on 13th December 1S9S whether the Viceroy had confirmation of this report, and whether such a lease would be consistent with the declaration of 20th March 1S91, if true. 320. Major Fagan had no confirmation of the reported lease of Bunder iia. No. 141. Gesseh, ^ but thought it possible. He understood that the port referred to was Jisseh, an excellent harbour 5 miles south-east of Maskat. Colonel Meade wished to inform the bultan and enquire whether there were grounds for the report. Ihe Viceroy proposed to authorize this and add warning that such action would contravene declaration of 20th March 1891. The Secretary of State's instructions on these proposals were asked by telegram on 24th December 1S98. 321. On 3rd January 1899 the Secretary of State replied with reference to ibid Ko. 117. the Viceroy's telegrams of i'Otb and 24th December— 'Declaration of 1862 must be maintained and respected; subject to this, I am prepared to approve any measure which does not require French concurrence and which you think Likely to be o22. Fjom further enquiries made by him. Major Fagan inferred that Jisseh was the place, wmch had been probably leased or intended to be leased to the Jbrenco, it being a small but good harbour 6 miles south-east of Maskat, It69 was further ascertained by him that the Prench Consul and the Commodore of the French man-of-war Scorpion had visited the place, and taken photographs and plan of the part in October 1898. 323.

Major Fagan protested against the Sultan's action as being infringement of the Treaty ot 1891, to which His Highness replied denying infringement, but added tbat his promise to the Erench had been given and that if the British Government objected, they should settle matters with the Erench Government. [C973EI)]1 70 CHAPTEK XVIII. The Rupture, 1899- 324. We now arrive at a critical stage in the history of Maskat. If tlie French should succeed in establishing a coaling station at a good harbour like Jisseh, we should soon have an important naval base in the hands of that power in alliance with Russia, which would be a serious menace to. our predominant position not only in Oman, but iu the Persian Gulf and might as well be dangerous to our Indian Empire. To prevent the French from taking hold of the grant was the first step to be taken ; for once in possession of it, it would be very difficult to oust them from the place. 325. The Commander of the Sphinx, at the request of Major Fagan, left accordingly an officer and a boat's crew at Jisseh with instructions to hoist the British flag in the event of the French man-of-war appearing on that harbour in his absence. Major Fagan also proposed to stop the monthly payment of the subsidy to the Sultan : the subsidy for December had not yet from Secretary of stite, dated 20th been paid. Hie Secretary of State, whose January 1899. instructions were asked, approved of the Secret E., February 1899, Nos. 90-189. ^ i • x i-i i ... « orders given as to the hoisting of the British flag at Jisseh in the contingency apprehended but in the sense that the act would not mean appropriation of territory, but would have, as its object, the prevention of infringement of arrangement of 189], under w hich Maskat can give or cede for occupation its territory only to the British Government. The Secretary of State also agreed to the suspension of subsidy pending further enquiry into the French concession. 326. Meanwhile Colonel Meade had been ordered to proceed to Maskat. On the 26th January the Redbreast left Bombay for Maskat. On the same date the Secretary of State wired that the Sultan might be reminded— Ist, Hid, No. 169. ^ formal recognition by the British ... , , . , Government notwithstanding the claims of his uncle and rival Abdul Aziz, who had hitherto been prevented from leaving India; that the Zanzibar subsidy w T as conditional on the Sultan continuing faithful in fulfilling engagements and manifesting friendship towards a • ( ^ e i r ? men ^' ^ ie Irtish Government in 1895 warned Abdullah bm Saleh to cease from attacking the Sultan and had repeatedly used their good offices to uphold his authority. He might also be warned that, in the event of unfriendly attitude on his part, diplomatic and military support would be withdrawn and might possibly take another direction. IE anything else was necessary, such as removal of Abdul Aziz, the Government of India could demand it on the authority of the Secretary of State's telegram ot 3rd January (see paragraph 321 above). 327. In pursuance of these instructions a telegram was addressed on 28th ibid, No. 173. January to Colonel Meade, who was Hmp rliVppfi-no I.;rv&gt; 4- 1 * 1 expected to have arrived at Maskat at the In^v wSfb ] translate an d read to the Sultan in Arabic, leaving a copy with His Highness, a memorandum drawn up by Lord Curzon in which and^e ^bli^atb^ hfi^ 16 toVsultan wereenuLraJ d (i) (ii) (iii) Aziz from all or any employment, either now or at any 'dismissal of Abdul future period ing'to be paicffor d^trihnf'rf P er ® e ^ , ^ ron J the present date on the sums remain- in the insurrection of 1895 0 ' 8ub ' !ects as indemnity for losses incurred dominion' of any ta7 onmp in any part of Your Highness' subjectsmerchandise, which is not levied from His HighnesB' ^ ' reduction''?' t ''to^ ^ T*' *nd the exportation.'' ou L ^ es brought from the interior for his vig'it^the Saltan s^uiTadm t0 preveilt the infringement of and shou d explain to them ttT f, dlstl ' ctl ™ fl *S for use by his subjects ■ t0 tllem tluit thereafter the use by tliem of a foreign flag71 would be an infringement of the declaration entered into by ike Governments of England and France to respect the Sultan's independence. 328. As regards the alleged grant of land at Jisseh, having regard to article 3 of the Maskat Treaty with Prance of 1844, it was necessary to make sure whether the concession was given to the French Government, or a company or in dividuals, and what were exactly the terras of the grant, whether it was a lease, etc. The facts ascertained by Major ibxd. No. 185-A. Fagan were these. In reply to a written protest addressed by him on 18th January 1899, the Sultan explained in a letter dated 19th January that ' we have given the French permission to have a coaling place, in the same way as you had one On the 22nd Major Fagan wrote to the Sultan saying that if he had given to the French a cove in the harbour of Maskat for coaling as to the English, he could easily prove it. On the 25th the Sultan replied that there was no cove available at Maskat except Mokalla, that there was no difference between Maskat and other parts of his dominions and that no greater rights had been given to the French than to the English. Major Fagan on the 26th wrote to the Sultan that he did not mean to say that the French could have a cove at Maskat, and that if the concession to the French Government were not in contravention of the agreement of 1891, the Sultan could produce the documents in proof. On the 28th the Sultan declined to comply with this request as being contrary to the costom of independent states. No further particulars of the Sultan's agreement with the French Govern ment were ascertainable. On the 29th January Major Fagan pointed out to the Sultan that the question was not the merits or demerits of the place granted to the French, but whether the grant did not contravene the agreement of 1891. 329. On the 31st January the Government of India telegraphed to Colonel Meade that among the demands to be made on the Sultan should of course be included the cancellation of the lease at Jisseh to the French. 330. Meanwhile the Sultan had found certain causes of complaint against the proceedings of Major Fagan. Firstly, on the 25th January, the Sultan protested against the Agency flagstatf being placed on the ground instead of the , roof as heretofore. It had' been removed when repairs were being made to the house, but not replaced on the roof, because its weight would be injurious to the roof. This was explained to the Sultan, and it was pointed out that the practice at Basrah and some other places in the Gulf was to place the flagstaff on the ground. 331. Secondly, Major Fagan had called a meeting of the Banias and frank ly informed them'of the Sultan's attitude to Government and of the suspensions of the subsidy, and told them that he looked to them to do nothing to assist the Sultan in withstanding the just demand of Government. The Sultan on 27th January complained to Major Fagan that he had forbidden the British Indian to do business with him. Major Fagan replied that he had merely informed of the situation and that probably they had inferred that the Sultan's security was inadequate. 332. The Russians were also intriguing at this time at Maskat. Major Fagan reported on 21st January that a Eussian spy was seen at Maskat interviewing the Sultan and Mons. Ottavi and promising visit of a Russian man-of-war and establishment of Russian Consulate. On 4ith February ^lajor Fagan reported that there was a rumour about the Sultan's preparing a house for Russian representative. 333. There was no time to be lost now in taking prompt measures to frustrate the intrigues of the French and the Sultan secret ix, March 1899, Kou. 104 212. against the British. Colonel Meade who was still at Bushire till the 1st February was ordered to proceed to Maskat at once. He arrived there on the 7th, and after exchanging with the Sultan the usual cere monial visits, telegraphed that he would deliver the memorandum, in which the clause demanding the cancellation of the grant of Bunder Jisseh had also been inserted, as soon as it would be translated. From what he had heard he feared that the'Sultan depending upon the French would probably decline to comply I I | | i I I t72 with our demand. He therefore suggested that, in that event, he might be authorized to exercise his judgment and compel compliance even to the length of employing naval force, if necessary, as delay ia coercing the Suitan would he misunderstood; that if possible Abdul Aziz should be deported, as he would retain his pernicious influence as long as he remained. 334. In repeating this message to the Secrfttary of State, the Viceroy recom mended the course suggested by Colonel Meade, subject to the caution about avoiding collision with the ^French, as we had proceeded too far to allow the Sultan to defy ua. 335.

Meade has been instructed to present memorandum to Sultan containing following demands : ' Dismissal of Abdul Aziz from employment under Sultan's authority, and settlement of outstanding questions concerning indemnity to British subjects for losses in 1895, and cessation of illegal taxes. To these he was instructed by me to add canoelling of Jisseh lease. Sultan having admitted lease to French Government, which we had already announced to him was violation of 1891 engagement, and could not be permitted. To present an ultimatum which omitted the chief ground of offence seemed to me indefensible. These are the demands which Meade asks leave if necessary to enforce. Does your telegram authorise compulsion to enforce the whole of these demands or only in case of refusal to cancel Jisseh lease? I Bubmit that it would be best to settle the whole matter while we can. Admiral leaves Bombay to-morrow for Maskat, and will be thure to advise Meade and to snperintend any measures that are required.

Condition attached to enforcement of demands was no persi nal collision with French. Failure of payment of indemnity to British subjects though part of our case against the Sultan stands on a different footing } its enforcement might raise local feeling against us. Meade should, therefore, exercise his discretion as to how far it is now politic to enforce its complete fulfilment.

In any case, I think that his subsidy should be withheld until we see if he is in earnest, and he should further agree not to receive representatives from other powers. The Viceroy wired on 16th February to the Secretary of State :— I think that assurance of support should be given ; also that subsidy should be withheld until good behaviour of Sultan vindicated. Meade forgets that America and France have treaty right to consular representation. But I suppose that he has Russia in view j and it might be well to provide against extended opportunities for intrigue. Before answering Meade, I await your reply. 339. On the 14th Admiral Douglas arrived from Bombay. On the 15th Resident wrote to the Sultan that he should anonunc3 the cancellation in a Darbar, and post up notification to the same efl'ect, besides informing the French Consul by letter and sending copy of the letter to the Resident, that he should also signify compliance with the other four demands, that the Sultan ought not to have sent copy of British agreement o£ 1891 to the Ereneh Consul, but having done so he should supply the Political Agent with a copy of the French agreement. As no answer was forthcoming from the Sultan the Resident placed matters in the hands of the Admiral, who peremptorily summoned the Sultan to come abraod the liag-ship Eclpse at 2 p. m., and caused the Ecipse to be wharfed broadside onto the town and the shipping to be cleared out of the line of fire. Immediately after a letter arrived from the Sultan with documents purporting to be copies of a public notification published in Maskat and Matrah and of a letter of cancellation (on ground of the 1S91 agreement) to the French Consul of the agreement with the French about a coaling place (the last date 7th March 1898). The Resident decided these were not sufficient and requested the Admiral to obtain full compliance. No notice was taken of a letter from the Sultan stating a Darbar had been convened and seeking to avoid a visit to the flag-ship. The Admiral refused even to allow the brother of the Sultan on board at 1 p.m. Ultimately the Sultan came on board before 2 p.m . After prolonged discussion the Sultan placed himself unreservedly in the hands of the British Government and left the ship under a salute of 21 guns. 340. On the 16th the French Consul protested in writing against the cancel lation of the lease. The Sultan wrote to the Jenebeh to return the flags accepted by them from foreign powers. On the 17th the Sultan requested the French Consul to use some person other than Abdul Aziz as a medium of communication, on the ground that he could not be received into the Sultan's house in future. The same day the Sultan informed the French Vice Consul that he did not re cognize French jurisdiction overMaskat subjects on Maskat soil, whether they were in possession of French flags or not, the French claim being contrary to the declaration of 1862. On the 17th the Admiral called on the Sultan and in the afternoon at a general darbar, attended by all the leading men of Maskat, the Sultan announced the renewal of amicable relations with the British Govern ment and cancellation of the agreement with the French for a coaling place, which had been entered into in forgetfulness of the rights of the British Gov ernment. The instruction not to insist on public cancellation of the French agreement reached Maskat too late. 311. On 20th February the Viceroy instructed the Resident that the Sultan might be assured of support, including protection against France, if necessary, if he continued to follow British advice, that the subsidy might be paid to him, future continuance to be dependent on friendly 'behaviour, that the Sultan, on renewal of subsidy, should be invited to promise to pay due regard in future to the advice of the British representative. The Secretary of State, in his telegram dated 21st February, authorised assurance of effective support to the Sultan if necessary j but the hoisting of the British fla 0, for that purpose would be unnecessary and indefensible^ the continued presence of British naval force at Maskat being sufficient. 342. In 23rd February Monsieur de Cambon complained to Lord Salisbury Telegram dated the 24th February 1809, from the 0 / ^ ie ex p es sive action of OIU' Admiral and Secretary of State for India, Loudon, to the Viceroy. the publicity and tone of prCSS. Lord secret e., march 1899, Nos 104-212. (No. 200j. Salisbury maintained that independence . . x ^ 3 ^ y of the Saltan was seriously threatened if either signatory to the dec aration of 1862 acting as a sovereign State could take a lease otany portion of Maskat territory. Monsieur de Cambon declined to admit this interpretation of treaty, and in any case objected to the violent means75 taken to assert it. Lord Salisbury, whilst admitting the affair had not been con- ducted as quietly as it well mi^ht have been, reasserted his views of the declara tion and considered that our action was, in substance, entirely right. He referred to the subsidy and the special engagement prohibiting alienation of territory. Monsieur de Cambon denied any designs of permanent occupation; objected to the proposal of acquiring a coaling station in the name of ^French citizens, and suggested that the same end would be attained if France, retaining hei acqui* sition, formally disclaimed any interference from her possession of a coal depot, which could be construed as derogatory to the independence of the Imam or establishing any right to the littoral. Lord Salisbury promised to consult the India Office on this suggestion. 343. The Viceroy, having been consulted, telegraphed Telegram No- 315-E. A-, dated the 25tli February 1899. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Your telegram 24th. Our view is that French policy at Maskat in respect of Arab dhows and appointment and intrigues of Vice-Consul and finally of demand for coaling depot has been inspired by calculated hostility to Great Britain. Ue do not dispute her treaty rights ; but we proteded against their exercise in a munner^ unfriendly to ourselves and in a spot where French interests are insignificant and British interests are^ supreme. After compelling Sultan to cancel Jisseh cession, we entertain strongest objection to reviving it in any other form or disguise. Neither can we understand why coal -sheds even like our own, should be required by French in Maskat. In 1897 no French merchants steamer entered Maskat. There are no French subjects beyond trench protected Arabs. A French o-un-boat visits Maskat at very rare intervals, and can procure coal trom VvMish. depot when required. For what purpose therefore is a coal depot required either in Maskat harbour or—which is much more suspicious—elsewhere in Maskat territory . On other hand we subsidise Sultan. Wo have practical monopoly of trade; and our political influence in Maskat has hitherto been and must remain supreme. Similarlv we are unable to understand sudden French interest in Persian Gulf. Her imports to entire Gulf ports m 1897 amounted to £75,000, of which £69,000 was loaf-sugar Only one small French steamer entered any of these ports. French intrigues at Koweit already reported, and at Maskat, appear to us to be designed solely to annoy Great Britain and to assist Russian policy in Gulf. We regard the case therefore as one in which, while there may benaritv of treaty right, there is no other parity, political or commercial; and we earnestly entreat Lord Salisbury in discussions with French Ambassador to bear in mind these views. We have iust received from Meade translation of Jisseh grant to French -.—Begins. Be it known to all that we have given to French Government a place for coal on the coast at a distance from dwelling houses where it would not hurt them, outside Maskat, a piece of land about the size of a godLn in one of the coves dependent on Maskat, as a mark of favour and respect to the great French Government on account of the friendship and concord.^ n ■. This is dated March 7th, 1898, and was apparently made at time of visit of Frenc aim boat Nevertheless M. Delcas^e told Sir E. Monson on December 2nd that it was first he W heard oHt and that he did not believe it. The inference from this statement and from M Cambon's suggestions is that depot was intended as a means of competing with Bntis i fohS^influencem Gulf. Full report to you will follow by next mad for Parliamentary use. 344. On 27th Eebruary the Secretary of State telegraphed that the French Government accepted English reading of the treaty of 1862 that neither State might accept cession or lease of Mashat territory, hut wished to have a coal depot on the same terms as our otvn, oA/i a The nuestion of our right to make demands on the Sultan regard- ing lotiga representatives was again discussed, and In a telegram dated the fnth ■pphruarv 1893, the Foreign Department informing Colonel Meade that he should he careful not to make any demand upon the Sultan to receive no Forei-n representatives, which would be contrary to treaty requested a report as to what reason, if any, the Sultan had given to the Irench Consul for declining to receive one Ahdul Aziz as French Agent. oa k Ti ie Secretary of State in his telegram, dated 28th February, direot- pd the Government of India to write to the Sultan expressing satisfaction at his acceding to the terms of the demands made on him and binding himself to abide by the advice of our Agent, and to state that if thereafter he Irene, Government asked for coaling facilities, the British Government would not76 i object if the request was limited to shed or sheds and carried no territorial or political rights. The Secretary of State was of opinion that the result of the recent action combined with such procedure should be to establish for the future the paramount position in Maskat of the British Government. 346. The Political Agent, Maskat, in Lis telegram dated the 28th February 1899, reported that the Sultan's attitude regarding Abdul Aziz was one of duplicity, and that he had therefore deemed it advisable to withhold for the present the payment of the subsidy. He further pointed out that Abdul Aziz was busily engaged in raising the tribes of the Sharkiyeh against the British by telling them that the British Government intended to annex Oman. The following telegram was sent to Major Pagan : i£ facts are as stated ia your telegram, you are authorised to withhold subsidy. Please report evidence on which they rent and do not eharg-e Sultan with bad faith without authority from Resident. J , Tl10 Sultan was found still receiving Abdul Aziz by day and night. Abdul Aziz was also in Sharkiyeh endeavouring to raise the tribes'against the British. The Viceroy, therefore, thinking the moment inauspicious, suspended the communication proposed by the Secretary of State, informing the latter accordingly. TheAgent was authorised to withhold the subsidy. 348, In their despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 38» dated 2nd March Secret e., March 1899, Nob. icm-212. (No. 210). aiter reviewing the previous historv ln , 1( j e . Maskat, the following observations were f„rf Jr h f? lll)]ici ^ ? Wllich Meade insisted, went, as has been remarked further than we had contemplated, and might possibly be represented as unneceesary for the execution ot the ol^ect. m view. Before, however, such a criticism be passed it would be fair to regard the circumstances from a local as well as from a wider point of view. No part of the proceedings has more impressed upon the Sultan and upon his people the gravity of the T 011 ? 1S H^ness * late action had brought upon him, or has had a greater effect m clearing from his mmd the misconception of his position which he owed to the promptings of advisers intent upon alienating His Highness from his ancient alliance. It Fs vevhJs impossible for a petty ruler of an Oriental State, such as the Sultan of Maskat, to realise his po ihon in ielation to powerful foreign Governments or to understand the limits of diplomatic action based upon the principle of equal treatment ; and he had undoubtedly been led to regard the presence and proceedings during the past live years of a representative of France at Maskat as an encouragement to himself in a course of action dictated less by a vindication of his onn independence than by disregard of his obligations to Great Britain. ■ a If th ,l q T tl01 i M ' ere ^ ske . d on what grounds other than those of increasing their political influence the French should wish to establish a coaling station on the coast of Oman if i«j rnhT subjects of the Sultan and the Sultan himself would probably find some' diffi culty m answering, and to which we are ourselves unable to sucrrrest a reply Coal for tbp assc t swa tK^sts^srSa sifeSrs is supported by the peculiar device of ? sleamsh'ps, other than those of the Navy, are hardly k»ow 0 ia the Gulf ] n ,he%e a ^18»7 not a single trench steamship entered the harbours of Oman Nor i&lt;!

The subjects of the Sultan of Maskat trade in British ports ; they have few relalionsj with foreisrners save with British subjects ; no other European Power is anything to them but a name. What psases at Maskat is the talk less of the tribes of Eastern Arabia, than it is of the population who throng the wharves of Karachi and Bombay. Neither the actions of the Sultan nor the destinies cf his country theieiore can be considered in isolation from the physical and political environment to which they appertain. If on the one hand the connection with British India is as close as it has been shown to be, on the other, or Persian side, it is by British efforts, and by British efforts alone, that those seas have been pacified, their wat ers surveyed, their commerce developed, and their security as-sured. It is impossible in our opinion that this two-fold association ot the State of Maskat should be ignored, or that the results of a century's laborious service on the part of Great Brit-iin should be thrown into jeopardy by an interference dictated by other reasons, and devoid of any apparent connection with the locality itself. 349. On 28tli February Major ¥agan visited tbe Sultan and latter promised to carry out the wishes of Government about Abdul Aziz, but on 1st IVSarch the Sultan again received Abdul Aziz. Mods . Ottavi saw Major Pagan and tried unsuccessfully to get him to withdraw his objections to Abdul Aziz dealing with the Sultan. 350. The British Law Officers on being consulted by the India Office held m that declaration of 1862 did not require the British Government to abstain from exercising predominant influence in Maskat, so long as that influence was not exerted in a way inconsistent with independence of Maskat; the subsidy, and the terms on which it was made payable involved no breach of declaration, (2) that the British Government would be justified in punishing and even deposing a particular Sultan who broke engagements with the 15 ntish Govern ment, the consent of France not being necessary. It would be a breach of decla a- tion if after deposition a Sultan were set up who was not independent. The Sultan could not consistently with independence of Maskat be compelled to accept ministers and advisers acceptable to British Government. 35^ 359. The Secretary of State wished to know how Major Eagan had Droceeded to insist on Sultan's not receiving Abdul Aziz. The Viceroy stated in renlv in his telegram dated 14th March that the Sultan was not required not to receive Abdul Aziz. The Sultan apparently wrote spontaneously to M. Ottavi that he would not receive Abdul Aziz. The latter had been regularly pai y Sultan from November 1895 to October X898. Major Eagan reported on 14th March that the tribes inflamed by Abdul Aziz wrote to the Sultan offering their assistance a-ainst British. On the 7th March the French Consul informed the Sultan that France and England had arrived at a settlement; that France had secured from England an assurance that the independence of Maskat wou d e resnected and that no objection would now be raised by the British Government to ^raot coal-depot by the Sultan to France. The French Consul stated that he would not press the Sultan to receive Abdul Aziz. After this visit the Sultan attilude improved, but the subsidy was still withheld. H60 On 12th March Sultan paid the first friendly visit ever paid by him to the Political Agent at the Agency. His attitude was improving daily. Major Faean informed the Sultan that there would be no objection to the French havino- a coaling shed in Maskat harbour similar to the English, no political or territorial rights being involved, provided the British Government was consult ed as to the situation and condition and assent given and the proposal from the French Consul was submitted to Major Eagan in writing. 361 The Political Agent was directed by Colonel Meade m his letter No. So, j March 1899 to bring the necessity for distinctive Maskat flag to dated 26t h M sultan appeared to be under the impression that recent 8U ™ of «°Xdian Gov—t C about to be repudiated by Her Majesty's Government. The Saltan enquired if similar adTioe about flag bad been given to Zanzibar and said he would consult the Jenebeh. The Government of India to ZianziLc pointed out that Zanzibar was a British Secret e ., June 1899, No. 120-125. protectorate and that in the recommend- . 11ca n f distinc ive flag the Sultan, should sees recognition of his posi- tiotrwbiob in bis own interestshe would do well to accept (letter to the Kesident, dated 3rd June 1569). C97aFD78 i 362. On 3rd March 1899, the Secretary of State telegraphed that the a .r. L Prench Ambassador had been informed Secret E., March 1899, Noi. 722-77?. ,. , . , ... . tnat an interpellation on the atlairs would be made on the morrow in the French Chamber, to which M. Delcasse would reply that negotiations were in progress, with a view to France being accorded a coal dep6t on same terms as England holds hers- 363. His Excellency the Viceroy stated (telegram dated 4th March) in reply that the depot should be in the Maskat harbour and on the same conditions as ours, if elsewhere the entire effect of the recent occurrences would be destroyed, 864(. The Secretary of State telegraphed on 10th March :— ' It i8 understood with French Government that we shall not object to coaling sheds ia Ma^kat harbour under same conditions as ours. This satisfies them and as regards France, incident is virtually closed. As regards Sultan, Agent should at once be instructed to inform him that if he receives any request for onaling sheds from French Ageut, we expect him to consult our Agent as to situation aad conditions before complying. ' 865. There was then the question of the Vazir Mahomed bin Azzan. Secret E , July 1899, Nob. 4-99. •^ e WaS ^ 0S ^ e ^ ie Sultan because of Ms former dismissal, fine and imprisonment, and would like to embroil the Sultan with the British. Moreover, he was a French nominee and was always writing to Abdul Aziz, In Major Fagan's opinion his removal was necessary in the interests of the State as well as the British Government.^ Major Fagan further thought that the Sultan might accept a British official to superintend the customs if he were given a loan on their security, that indefinite stoppage of subsidy would destroy the Sultan's remnants of power (Major Fagan to Colonel Meade, dated 20th March). The Government of India did not propose at present to make future payments of subsidy contingent upon financial control, nor to reduce subsidy because of fall in exchange. Renewal would be favourably considered, when recommended on political grounds ; but customs question should be settled in advance, and Sultan's loyalty ascertained before reverting to ante status quo (telegram dated 14th April). 866. The Secretary of State approved of the suggestions, and as to the coal sheds the arrangement approved of was that English and French Governments should agree before as to procedure about coaling sheds and instruct representatives accordingly j but that there should be no joint communication from the two Consuls to the Saltan. The right of the French was to be restricted to occupancy on sufferance, conferring no territorial or sovereign rights. Coal might be in charge of Agent or subordinate ; but there should be no question of protective works or of flying French flag over sheds. Complete liberty of action should be reserved to the Government of India and its Agent The British Agent should require the Sultan to consult him on application of the French Agent. 367. After consultation with the Foreign Office, the Secretary of State decided (Secretary of State's despatch No. 14, dated 2lst April 1899) that no exception need be taken to intimation made by the Sultan of Maskat to the French Consul (see paragraph 340 above) refusing to recognise right of France to exercise jurisdiction over Maskat subjects while residing in or visitin^ bis dominions, provided Article IV of French Treaty of 1844 with Maskat was not contravened. 368. The foreign Office on complaint of the French Ambassador animadver- ted severely on Major Fagan's 'unauthorised' demand that proposals of French Consul should be submitted by the Sultan to him for approval of Gov- ernment of India. r t May the Secretary of State replied to the Government of India despatch ot 2nd March (see paragraph 34,8&gt; stating that they were right to take measures to guard against repetition of misunderstanding 'in view of the results of French Consul's original action in obtaining the lease. 370. On 5th May lb99, the Secretary of State telegraphed that M. Cambon Secret E., July 1809, Nog. 4—93, had addressed Lord Salisbury about estab- i . j . . i . .. lishment ol a coal depot on the same terms as ours, but without giving details, and that Lord Salisbu/y would consider the proposal when Major Fagan had reported on the precise situation desired by inll ti fw 'w ^f 8311 on . 1 ? rriln S Ijord Salisbury's decision, might tell the Sultan that His Highness might consent accordingly. The Govern ment of India directed Major Fagan to ascertain orally from M. Ottavi79 the precise situation desired for the Erench coal depot at Maskat, avoiding written communications. Major Fagan replied that the situation was not decided and that he was told by M. Ottavi that when the French man-of-war next visited Maskat, the Captain would be asked to choose the place. The Viceroy protested to the Secretary of State against settlement of matter in London in general terras, particular application being left to the Sultan (telegram dated 17th May). The Government of India wired to Major Fagan, inquiring sites for French coaling shed least open to objection (telegram dated 23rd May). 371, The Government of India agreed tbat no further formal demands need be made on the Sultan at present and that the Eesident might exercise discretion as to payment of the subsidy, that payment might be recommenced if the Sultan's attitude had substantially improved or the Saltan specifically applied to the Poli tical Agent for payment; or if there were a real risk of Sultan turning to the Trench for pecuniary aid'or selling concession to foreign adventure. It was desirable, however, if possible to settle customs question in advance^ (letter to Besident, No. 747-E.A., dated 25th May lb99). Major Pagan mentioned Gobetnell cove, Ma'kalla, and Maskat town as sites for Erench coaling stations ; first had a bad approach, expensive to improve ; the third, dangerous to the town ; the second, the best and could be arranged by one out of three British sheds being sold to the Erench (telegram dated 27th March). 372 As the result of correspondence between 17th April and 9th ^ a y&gt; i* 1 which Major Fagan offered to move in renewal of subsidy, Sultan declined to do more than take into consideration the Agent's advice and that only when not likely to be injurious to himself or to cause trouble to his subjects. The Resi dent recommended the continued withholding of the subsidy w ® u } d ably cause the Sultan's Government to collapse (Besident s No. 78, dated 29th May 1899). , « x i- 373 Maior Fasan was instructed under orders from the Secretary of btate to tell the Saltan that if the Erench applied for a s^e for coahng shed within Maskat harbour, on the same conditions as the English, without fla 0 o fortification, the British Government would not opose ; but such concession elsewhere could not be acquiesced in, that Major Eagan was to maintain his rieht to be consulted by the Sultan, but to show every consideration to French susceptibilities and meet Prench wishes as far as possible (telegram dated 3rd June) Major Eagan reiterated the condition about consulting Go ^ rn- ment in announcement to the Sultan about the terms on which the British Goy- ernment approved the grant of a place to the Frenc . ^ . 374. The Government of India pointed out to the Besident the mistake of Maior Faean in substituting reference to Government of India for reference to himself on two occasions. The intention was that Major Eagan should not make difficulties and should inform the Sultan beforehand ot the approval of the British Government on certain conditions : he was nevertheless to let it be known that he expected to be informed of, and consulted about, any proposition the irench Agent might make. Major Fagan was to be informed for glance 'n order thathe might make the point clear m future conversation with the Sultan (telegram tiated 8th June). . „ ... x ^ n 376 The Foreign Office, London, acquitted Ma]or Fagan of intentionally s exC eeding instructions and recognised the Secret Augurs 1899, N ob . 184—209. difficulty and delicacy of his position in consequence of declaration of 1862; hut thought he had not recognised importance of avoiding language inconsistent with the Sultan's independence : his statement that he would forward French proposal to the Goyernment of India throuTthe usual channel, for approval. The Foreign Office also commented on his asking the Sultan for explanation why he Abdul Aziz (Foreign Office to India Office, dated 4th July). « , , j ^ ^ 070 on the 25th July 1899, the Secretary of State telegraphed that the French Ambassador stated that while the Hid. Not 197 and 206. British Government would not give its large Rhed either of the two smaller sheds would be inadequate for French require- ments, and therefore asked for the creek of Rujam or Kejam. On MajorFagan s report the following telegram was addressed to the Secretary of btate. Telegram P, No. 1169-E.-A., dated the 6tli Aoguit 1899. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To-Hts M ^ ,t ^ t French contention that there is not Bufficient ^ tbat at hUle trouble aad expense they80 could have same size coal-slied at Makala as we have. Ru-jam is inhabited cove hetweeu Maskat and Mattrah ; it is favourite summer anchorage for French Suri dhows, but is exposed to north-west winds prevailing during winter, and consiquently quite unsuited for coal depot, though position is favourable for commanding entrance to Mattrah harbour and could be easily fortified. Fagan adds decision of Her Majesty's Government not to allow any site outside Maskat harbour for French coal depot is generally known, and strongly urges that it be main tained. I would further observe that the arrangement suggested object of which is very transparent, is not in accordance with the proposal made by the French Ambassador in hia interview with Sanderson on 18th April, nor with the Ambassdor's letter to Lord Salisbury of ith May, and it is quite inconsistent with the communication made to the Sultan as directed by your telegram of 2nd June. I consider we should insist on coaling station being inside Maskat harbour, and 1 urgently deprecate any further withdrawal from tl»e position we have taken up under instructions more than once repeated from Her Majesty's Government. 377. The French Government was informed on 10th August that the British Government; could not agree to Riyam site and the offer of the third shed, Makalla cove, was renewed (Secretary of State's telegram dated 18th September). 378. Major Fagan reported that Sayyid Faisal's bias in favour of the French was due merely to the fear of English designs. He was never favourable to the English, was farther alienated by our failure to assist Lim in 1895 and finally was imbued with rlistrust of the English by Ottavi. His behaviour in the quarantine affair proved his suspicions.

Income from customs ($ 470 a day)—and the Sultan had lately confiscated the estate of a Baluchi murdered at Sib, worth $25,000—kept the Sultan in funds. He had lately utilised Abdul Aziz to deal with the Ben Ruwahah garrison at Rostak; he would never ceaae to cause an&amp;iety to the Government of India and would never of his own free will allow British influence again to predominate at his Court (Major Fagan's letter dated 28th September). 379. In his despatch No. 37 (Secret), dated the llth August 1899, the Secret e., October 1899, noi. 24—39. Secretary of State offered certain remarks as to the question of resuming payment of the subsidy to the Sultan of Maskat, and recommended such a course as being the best means of re establishing a good understanding with the Sultan. It was thought that the arrival of Captain Cox at Maskat on appointment as Political Agent would bo a good opportunity to presume payment of the subsidy, and that though the question of arrears would arbe, he might be able to get the Sultan to agree to the balance of the Maakat indemnity being met out of the arrears, in which case the punitive tax could be abolished. 380. The following letter was issued ;— No. Io09-E. A., dated Simla, the 2nd October 1899. From—-H. S, BiENEs, Esq., C.S.I., Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Depart ment, ^ To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to my letter No. 747-E.A., dated the 25th May 1899, and your letter No. 7H, dated the 29thMay 1899, I am directed to enclose a copy of a Secret despatch No. 87, dated the llth August 1899, from the Secretary of State for India regarding Maskat affairs. 2. Should Captain Cox, upon arrival at Maskat, be received in a friendly spirit by the Sultan, and should be, after making himself acquainted with the circumstances of the situation report in favour of a resumption of the subsidy to the letter, the Government of India would be inclined, subject to your advice, to acquiesce in such a proposal. 3. As regards the arrears of the subsidy due since the last payment for November 1898, these should only be paid, subject to the deductions necpssary on account of the repayment of the loan granted to the Sultan in 1897 and to the display on the part of the Sultau of a sincere desire to resume friendly relations, and of a disposition to defer in future to the advice of the Government of India. The monthly payment of the subsidy should probably be resumed first, and the payment of arrears held over until the Government of India have been satisfied by Captain Cox and yourself of the bond ^ and loyalty of the Sultan. It would also be desirable, in the opinion of the ^Government of India, to liquidate from these arrears, the balance of the indemnity due to British subjects for the losses incurred in the rebellion of 1895, a proposal which would have the further advantage of enabling the Sultan to abolish at once the punitive tax levied on the export trade, By these measures all outstanding accounts would be settled ; and it would be possible to make a fresh etart at Maskat with fair chances of success, Captain Cox should be directed to report upon these proposals.81 CHAPTEE XIX.

The existence of principal sheds, long in our possession on northern site, would render irs surrender somewhat invidious, and French Government, convinced of our bond jides ) might be expected not to press for it. (3) Should the French choose the southern site and build further upon it, they should pay us for shed No. 3. (4) Should they claim northern site, they will acquire with it sheds Nos. 1 and 2. They should pay for these ; but occupation should not take place until wall has been built and we have constructed for ourselves new shed on southern site and have removed our coal thereto. The invidiousness of this solution would, to some extent, be diminished by such a procedure.' BSe. The Secretary of State on the 1st May 1900, telegraphed that Monsieur Delcasse was disposed to accept the division of sites in Makalla Bay and stated that the available sites should now be divided, and the French allowed to take their choice. The following telegram was sent to Colonel Meade : Telegram No. 957-E. A., dated the 4tk May 1SOO. From—The Foreign Secretary, Simla, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire. Meade's letter No. 65 February 19th Freoch Goyernment are now disposed to aceert division of sites in Makalla Cove. Total space should now be evenly divided by a wall from sea to high ground at back. Choice of sites w.ll be made when division has been affecW Saltan should he mtormed of what we have agreed to. Please instruct Co! accordingly The plot of ground to the south of the British coal sheds was select- ed for the hrenoh coal shed ; But here there was the difficulty of securin- the required area ot land without having to buy on one side the huts of Socotra fishermen, and destroying on the other side two of the British sheds. 337. To understand the P''sihon it would be necessary to go a little into the history of the British coal sheds. Up to year 1875, Government used to stock their coal in three o-cdowns in Maskat and the British India Steam Navigation Company had a small coal shed in the Makalla Cove, lor which no rent was paid. An annual rent of Us 174 was paid by Government for one godown, the other having been given bv the Sultan rem free. Iwo fires having broken out in the coal godowns in 1875 which endangered the safety of the town of Maskat, Sayyid Turki offered to allow Colonel Miles to build a godown at Makalla next to the British India Steam Navigation Company's coal-shed. The Government coal was accordinfflv stored there. In 1886 the British India Steam Navigation Company broke up their coal depot and soid the materials of the shed by auction, the sitebein'- resumed by the Sultan, and handed oyer to Colonel Miles for the use of Government The ground on which the Makalla coal-sheds stand was not purchased by Govern ment nor was it iented, and there is nothing in the records of the Agencv office to show whether the Sultan made a gift of it to the British Government or whether he merely allowed our coal-sheds to be built there out of courtesv Ihe whole cove was not taken up by us, a portion of it being occupied by Socotra fishermen whose huts adjoin our coal-sheds. The cove has always been open to all and no British flag has ever been hoisted at Makalla.83 388. 'With tbe co-operation of the Sultan it was so arranged that it was not found necessary to buy out the Socotra 28th hut owners on the north, while on the south His Highness allowed the British Consul to reclaim and include other cove, so that we could comply with the demolish and Captain Co* to Resident, No. 445, dated August 1900, Secret E., December 1£00, Nos. 1-6 (No. 1). ground on the French side of the French stipulation for equal superficial area without having to re-build part of our coal-sheds Nos. 1 and 2. (ii) Reinstatement of Sayyid Said bin Mahomed as official representative of the Sultan with the British Consul. 389-390. On his arrival at Maskat Captain Cox generally did all his business in direct personal communication secret b., June looo, ^o. 109. with the Sultan. Captain Cox, however, pointed out to His Highness that during the latter's absence from Maskat, or in other circumstances, when personal communication with him was not possible, it would be impossible to transact any business with his Vazir Mahomed bin Azan, who was in his dotage. The Sultan did not like to dismiss Mahomed bin Azan, as he was still capable of doing more mischief as an Vazir than Vazir and as the old man would not live much longer, His Highness vould let him alone, but offered to appoint Sayyid Said bin Mahomed as his representative in official business communication between himself and the British Consulate. Captain Cox considered Said bin Mahomed as the most enlightened and long-headed of the Sultan s subjects. He was a staunch friend of the English and was popular among the tribes. Tbe arrangement therefore was accepted by Captain Cox (letter No. 252, dated 16th May 1900, to Captain Kemball). (iii) Interchange of presents between the Sultan of Maskat and the Naval Com mander-in-Chief of the East India Station, 1899-1900. 391. Before his departure from Maskat on 18th February 1899, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Secret e ., July icoo, Nos. i2i-i26. Douglas, had been presented by the Sultan with a sw ^ord and some silver articles, which he accepted; as Colonel Meade gave him to understand that they were offered in accordance with the usual custom and that to decline them would give very great offence. A return present of a double -barrelled sporting rifle and 1 ,000 cartridges (of the value of about £35—the estimated value of the Sultan's presents) was made to His Highness in May 1900 by Captain Cox, in pursuance of the Secretary of State's orders (see correspondence ending with Captain Cox's letter to Resident, No. 246, dated loth May 1900). The Sultan requested Captain Cox to convey his thanks to the Government of India. (iv) Vigorous action taken by the Sultan in regard to the French flag question. (See Chapter XX below page 86.) (v) Handing over Quarantine arrangements to the Agency Surgeon. (See Chapter XXV J below page 140.) (vi) Resumption of subsidy and loans to the Sultan. 892. Captain Cox was asked to report whether the attitude of ^ the Sultan would iustify a resumption of the subsidy (letter No. 3 507, dated 5th October 1899 to the Resident). In anticipation of Secret e ., February 1900, Nos. 96-io5. sanction of Government he resumed payment of the subsidy running from 1st October 1899. As to the arrears he sub mitted the following statement of accounts—as he approximately calculated:— Rs. Amount of arrears of subsidy from Teceinbsr 1898 to September lb99 both inclusive— Rs. Rs. 7,200 per mensem ... 72,000 Deficit ... ... 18,000 Deficit 90,000 Arrears of instalments of loans for same months at Rs 2,000 per mensem ... 20,000 For tbe balance of loans due ... 86,000 Balance of indemnity due to British subject at Rs. 1530 per $100 about 34,000 90,00 084 393. Colonel Meade, after consulting Major Cox personally, proposed that the arrears of the indemnity should not be deducted from the arrears of the subsidy, since the burden of paying the indemnity would shift from the guilty tribes to the Sultan and the 'improved attitude of His Highness would not justify such a measure (Resident'sNo. 12-T., dated 2nd December 1899). 394(. The Government of India considered that arrears of subsidy' bad been forfeited by the conduct of the Sultan, thai even the application of arrears to the discharge of the Sultan's liabilities was exceptional generosity of Govern ment towards him and that the whole balance of the loan of 1897 should be paid out of arrears and, as regards indemnity, quarterly instalments of balance for Snptember and December 1899, if owing, should be deducted from the arrears of the subsidy, similarly interest at 5 per cent, ou unpaid balance from February 1899; but the balance of the capital sum of indemnity, Rs. 34,000, might, for political reasons, continue to be paid off by instalments. Hopes were, how ever, held out that the Sultan might possibly obtain mitigation of these orders by proper attitude to the representative and representations of the British Government, and it was ordered that immediate liquidation of the loan might be abandoned in return for substantial concession by Sultan in regard {e.g.) to management of customs ; but that monthly instalments must of course be paid from December 1898 till the debt was extinguished (letter No, 14.-E. A., dated 9th January 1900). 325. The Government of India accepted $4,564, paid by the Sultan as proceeds of punitive tax between June and December 1899, in place of the full instalments for quarters ending September and December; no deduction from subsidy arrears, therefore, was to be made on this account. 896. The matter was further discussed in the Foreign Department. Obli gatory deductions remaining were arrears of monthly repayments of loan _ , , non „ ,. n ~ 0 (Rs. 20,000) and interest on unpaid bal- Secret E., June 1900, J«os. / 0-72. v c-i •i.i? t^-i ance of indemnity from February 1899 to date (about Rs. 216). This left about Rs. 49,835. The question was whether this sum should be devoted to extinction of the loan, or of the indemnity, or of o .17 T iQnn v Tnto both, orof neither? In the last contin- Secret E, June 1900, k os, 70-72. i ii ^ i gency should not any return be exacted for these favours ? Any balance left in any case would be retained by Govern ment, unless the Sultan made concession in matter of customs or the Maskat flag. Captain Cox w r as asked to report on these points (No. 1086-E.A., dated 21st May 1900). 397. The Sultan had behaved well in the matters of partition of Makalla cove, restoration of e^-Wazir Sayyid Said, spirited action in re French flag our request to have scurrilous Franco-Arabic leaflets suppressed and his offer to place quarantine arrangements in charge of Agency Surgeon : Captain Cox, therefore, recommended that only Rs. 20,000, the arrears of monthly instalments for loan and Rs. 27,000 entire balance (with interest to September) of the in demnity should be deducted from arrears of subsidy, and the rest of arrears (Rs. 25,000) should be handed to Sultan ; the rest of the loan (Ks. 17,000 due on 2nd September) to be paid off by monthly instalments of Rs. 2,000 as formerly. The Government of India ordered set-off against Rs. 72,000 in hand of Rs. 20,000 (arrears of loan instalments) and Rs. 27,000 (arrears of indemnity) and Rs. 17,000 (balance of loan) and payment of Rs. 8,000 to the Sultan, provided his loyal action had received no check (telegram to the Resident, dated 12th September 1900). 398. The account as settled by Captain Cox after consulting the Comp- secret e , december 1900, nos. i-6. troller, India Ireasuries, was— Rs. (1) Due on account of loan, principal and interest, up to 1st October 1900 ... 35,340 (2) Due on account of indemnity to British Bubjects, with interest, from 9th February 1898 ... ... ... ... ... 27,026 (3) Balance payable to the Sultan ... ... ... 9,637 Total ... 72 00085 The sum of Rs. 9,634 was accordingly handed over to the Sultan (Captain Cox to Resident, No. 613, dated 9th October 1900). 399. In 1903, there remained a sum of $972 of unclaimed indemnity, and this the Government of India ordered to be secret e.. june 1903. nos. 272.273. refund ed to the Sultan (No. i61-E„ dated 8rd June 1903). [C973FD]86 CHAPTEB XX. The Erencli flag question, 1899—1904. (i) Vigorous action taken by the Sultan in the French Flag Question, 1900. 400. We have dealt above with the early history of the French Flag question up to the close of the year 1899 (See Chapter XIV), the action taken by the British Government in demaurlmg the adoption of a distinctive flag for Maskat in the ultimatum presented to the Sultan in February 1899, and half-hearted action taken by him in the matter (paragraph 340, Chapter XVIII). 401. We shall now proceed with the subsequent history of the question. In October 1899, the French Government complained through their Ambassador in London that Major Fagan sSlf;d.t,d had called in question the validity of 27th October i8^o. French protection accorded to Sari dhows jm.No. 5. flying the French flag and demanded from the Sultan that he should enforce the discontinuance of the use of the French flag by his subjects, promising the assistance of a British man-of-war. As a consequence of this complaint, the Foreign Office requested that, with out previous reference to them, nothing should be done in the way ot forcible intervention by British man-of-war. • Telepram to Secretary of State, dated tbe 12th The complaint Was reported* by Major July 1899. Fagan to be unfounded.. 402. In his despatch No. 47 (Secret), dated the 24th November 1899, the Secretary of State asked the Government of India's opinion on certain sug gestions made as to the steps which might be taken to neutralise the effect of the grant of the French flag. The suggestions were— (1) That the Sultan should make an ordinance compelling every subject of Maskat who owns a ship to register it as a Maskat ship, and sail it under the Maskat flag. (2) That the Sultan should declare that he would not in his terri tory, after a date to be fixed, recognise any protection or neutra lisation thereafter conferred on his subjects otherwise than with his sanction or under the provisions of his treaties. (3) That the use of the British flag should be extended so as to outbid the French Consul. At the same time it was requested that, with a view to the possibility of coming to an arrangement with the French Government, a more precise account should be furnished of the modus operandi of the French, and of the evidence for the forthcoming to prove a connivance on their part in the slave trade or the exact details in respect of which they could be held to fail in their obligations under the Brussels Act, Articles 25 and 30. 403. Before the Political Agent could report on these points certain impor tant steps had been taken by the Sultan, which gave a fresh development of the French flag question. In his telegram, dated 17th May 1900, the Political Agent reported that with a view to provide the British Govern ment with the locm standi to move and approach the French Government in the matter, which was pointed as wanting in Foreign Office letter, dated 20th December 1898, the Sultan had offered to sign a letter definitely requesting the British Government to intervene with the French Government and discuss the question with them in his behalf, with a Tiew to effecting the removal of the flags now in use and discontinuance of the practice. 404. The Secretary of State was asked by the Viceroy in his telegram, 1Ud No 19 dated 22nd May, whether the Foreign Office would now act, as it seemed to His87 Excellency verv desirable that the opportunity should not be lost, though it was necessary to see the Sultan through, if we accepted the draft. 405. When the Secretary of State was about to reply that ller Majesty's Government would not support any attempt by the British Consul to induce the Sultan by promise of aid to enforce on his subjects the disuse ot the French ila^, another step was taken by the Sultan, which complicated or perhaps rather simplified the situation, still more. 406. In June 1900, when Captain Cox paid in the Sphinx his usual annual visit to Sur where there are about 2o to Srcret e, September 1900, KOS. 5-56. _ ^ Hindu British subjects, the Sultan Captain Coi'a telegraius, dated 15ub and 16th . . . f fliiq June *udi3 d July )900. also accompanied him lor toe place, uns jwrf, Noh. 23,33, ss.

Two davs later Abdullah bin Salim, the Amir ot the Bem-Ab All (one of the two tribes in Sur), came in with nearly one thousand men to do His Highness honour. 407 There was then—owing to the good offices of Al ^ !r Abdulla bin Sfcicrc Sfers: Sultan on 12 t ,h June a document solemn y to return Sultanas 'his vassals and under his P^tectiOn. t ,^^ r ^^ t ^ vi ' rnm e a t and the French Flags and papers they h.id a e ' {the ( i ocumen t.

The actual proceedings of the Commander of the French vessel were Telegram to Secretary of state, dated the 26th reported by Captain Cox to be of a very August 1900. different nature. He made no enquiries into the question whether the French flag-holders were implicated in the slave trade, but directed his endeavours mainly towards intimidating the Sultan into returning to the dhow-owners the French papers which they had handed over to him, and to persuading His Highness to receive as an intermediary between His Highness and the French Consul Abdul Aziz whom the Sultan had dismissed from his service. The attitude maintained by the Sultan in this situation was most satisfactory. He persisted in his refusal to receive Abdul Aziz, and declined to return the papers to their owners. The French vessel then visited Sur, and apparently persuaded some of the Sheikhs to recant from their undertaking given to the Sultan, and to plead that they had given it under pressure. Two of the owners of the papers, however, who had Landed them over to the Sultan, came into Maskat and after receiving their papers back from the Sultan, handed them over to M. Ottavi. On her way to Sur, the Drome met and stopped several Suri dhows proceeding to Basrah, and compelled them to come to Maskat flying the tricolour. 413. It was not until the Drome had left Maskat that the Government of • Secretary of State's telegram dated the 20th India 'W ere authorised 5 ^ to COUVGy to September 1900. Captain Cox the approval of Her Majes ty's Government of his action in supporting the firm and becoming attitude of the Sultan and in protesting against the French demands. 414. A second French vessel (the Catinat) called at Maskat in December 1900, and took the opportunity to visit Sur. The French Commander is said to have made much of the French flag-holders, and to have assured them that he bad settled the matter of the flags with the Sultan in a satisfactory way and that His Highness had agreed to let them all remain French subjects. (ii) Captain Cox's Report on the origin and manner of granting the French Flag, June 1900. 416. Now to go to Captain Cox's reportf on the points raised on the Secre- secret e., september ipoo, noa. 5-56. tary of State's Despatch No. 47, dated Eet.deT ^ aated 18 ' h , ° D6 1£ ' 0(,, t0 ^th November 1899, quoted above ibid, No. 41. (paragraph 402). The modus operandi followed by the French in giving the flags has been described above (paragraphs 2o6-239). 416. As regards the evidence of the French connivance in slave trade under the protection of their flag, Captain Cox, after careful enquiries at Sur J Slave running Bcasons are jast before and just during visit in Juno 1900, found that after the 8outh.we3t monsoon. QU the COUrse of the SCaSOU{ just OVCr, 1,000 slaves had been imported and landed close to Sur. Of these 850 were brought in large consignments in five dhows, three of which flew the French flag and arrived at Sur, when M. Ottavi was there. He was probably not an eye-witness of the landing of these slaves, which must have been done, some where to the south of Sur, but Captain Cox felt no doubt that M. Ottavi and his dragoman Abdul Aziz knew the facts well but only winked at them. 417. There were several irregularities in the way the French papers were given to the Arabs, which offended against the provision of the Brussels Act, Articles XXX, XXXIV, &amp;c. For example residence of the proteges was left out in several papers, no proper description of the vessel was given in some. 418. The particular law of France under which papers or flags were given by the France Consuls, Captain Cox reported his inability to trace.89 419 Then as regards the three alternative proposals—the first one that the Sultan should issue a notification repudiating the protection afforded by a foreign flag on his subjects, etc., was met, in Captain Cox's opinion, by the Sultan's edict of June 1900 (paragraph 408 above). 420. The second proposal that the Sultan should issue an ordinance com pelling every Maskat ship to be registered as such and sail under the Maskat flag, presumes the institution of a distinctive national flag, which the Sultan did not yet see his way to adopt. 421. The third proposal as regards the extension of the use of the British flag, so as to anticipate and outbid the French flag, would, in Captain Cox s opinion, place us in a false position. For the primary and chief excuse of the Arabs seeking the French flag is the harassing attentions of onr men-ot-war to their vessels, our objection to the use of the French flag is the cover they give to slave running, while from the Sultan's point of view the French protection which the Suri French flag-holders claimed even within his territory and terri torial waters was derogatory to his sovereignty. Now to go and make use ot t e French device of giving flags and in consequence our protection to Maskat subjects would expose us to the same objections which are raised against the French practice. 422. In submitting Captain Cox's report to the Secretary of State, the Government of India in their despatcn ibid. No. 53. No. 702, dated 26th July 1900, observed that the proclamation recently issued by the Sultan in which he refuses to re cognize in his territory French flags and papers given to his subjects without his permission had obviated to some extent the necessity for further action. t in order to provide against recurrence of the abuses m granting the French flags and in their use pointed out by Captain Cox, the Government of India pro posed that the attention of the French Government should be drawn to them by the ordinary diplomatic channel with a view to their correction. (iii) Increasing French influence at Sar, the principal head-quarters of French flag-holders, and measures proposed for counteracting its influence. 423. The subject of the increase of French influence in Oman was again brought into prominence in June 1901, Secret e., August 1901. Nos. 121 -208. Captain Cox, with a geological expert, deputed by the Government of India visited the neighbourhood of Sur (Kalhat and Rufsbeh) to examine a coal reef there. The exploration was conducted with the full knowledge and consent of the Sultan, but it met with considerable opposition from the local tribes, which Captain Cox attributed to the intrigues of the French Consul and Abdul Aziz. The Sultan then came down five weeks later it the urgent request of the British Consul to get him out of the difficulties. E Alrf. work was /S' '''r? exploring party to Maskat (Captain Coxs report I*o. 232, dated 15th June 1S01). For more details see Chapter XXI, p. 112, post. [G973FD]90 424. Captain Cox in his letter of the 3rd April 1901 mentioned the existence of an excellent harbour at Khor Secret e., September i9oi, Nos. 1-27. Jerama, a few miles south of Sur, where a ship could be stationed and would be within easy communicating distance of the Sultan. Subsequently he reported that the French Government had arrang ed to keep a man-of-War at Sur to set as a despatch boat between Maskat and Sur. 425. The attention of the Naval Commander-in-Chief was thereupon drawn to the harbour in question, and he was asked to arrange that the British flag should be displayed as frequently as possible in the neighbourhood of Sur owing to French activity in that quarter, and that Captain Cox should be consulted as to other places which might be visited with advantage. 426. In letter No. 211, dated the 31st May 1901, Captain Cox had pointed out the urgent need of the services of the British man-of-war in the Gulf in connection with the presence and doings of Mons. Ottavi and the two French cruisers at Sur, and the development of the French flag question, and had enquired whether arrangements could in future be made :— (o) That His Majesty's ships passing up and down the Gulf might be directed to call at Maskat and might be permitted to make their services temporarily available if necessary, at Captain Cox's request, in the absence of urgent demands for their employment elsewhere. (ft) That Captain Cox should be kept informed as far as possible of the movements of His Majesty's ships, also when it might be neces sary to withdraw those ships on duty at Maskat. 427. A communication was then issued by the Marine Department to the Naval Commander-in-Chief in accordance with Captain Cox's requests (Foreign Department, dated 2nd August 1902). 428. In letter No. 251, dated the 28th June 1901, Captain Cox reported „ ^ -.or that the Sultan had despatched 80 Secret E., October 1901, N ob . 124-185. ■ rirr i i • , ci , ■ i.i, n Wahabis to Sur to strengthen the garrison there, and that the French flag-holders having interpreted their advent as por tending the imminent arrival of the Sultan to take severe measures against them had asked Mons. Ottavi to state specifically what his support would amount to, in case the Sultan arrived on the scene and proceeded to employ force against them. He replied that as they were the Sultan's subjects, he could not give them any protection. 429. It was suggested that the Sultan should be induced to take the necessary measures with the object of strengthening his position at Sur, e.g., entertainment of a force of trained British Indian sepoys at Sur, purchase of an armed steam yacht for proceeding up and down the coast, and periodical visits to Sur and residing there for a while, and taking loan of a British official for administering the Sur Customs (Foreign Department letter to Captain Cox, No. ]330-E. A., dated 8th August 1901). 4S0. The Sultan was not prepared to accept our suggestion for the enter- c . r. /w v mrv. xr k..tainment of a. trained force of British Secret E, October 1901, Nos. 124-155. t t , a a . .a .i Indian sepoys, but took steps to strengthen his garrison at Sur. He also built a line of block-houses commanding the caravan routes to and from the interior, and arrangements \\ere made for supply of regular information by the Bombay Customs Department, which ■would enable His Highness to keep a check on the import trade. The Sultan however could not be induced to place a British official in charge of his cus toms, since he feared that the arrangement might lead to a coalition of his subjects against him (Political Agent's No. 352, dated September 1901). He arranged also to purchase a steamer (see Chapter XXV, para. 626). (iv) Notification proposed to be issued by the Sultan prohibiting use of French flag. 431. In April 1901, Captain Cox suggested that the Sultan might be advised to issue a further notification, in continuation of his edict above referred to (paragraph 408), to the effect that, from a date to be fixed, none of his nub- jects would be permitted to fly within his territories or in his territorial waters any foreign flag except with the written authority of the Sultan : and that any one acting in contravention of this order would be liable to fine or other punish ment.91 432. This suggestion was forwarded* to His Majesty's Government with. f Nf, fia the remark that, in the opiuioa of the 81 Government of India, the Saltan would be within his rights in issuing the notification. Bat they required the authority of His Majesty's Government before advising the Sultan to issae it. 433 Although, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, the grant . / xt n- of French protection to owners of the fcvm Secret ISApril 1902, Nos. 78-129 (Iso, 7 . n- was an ye t Lord Lanscl.owne did not consider that the &lt;f doctrine advanced by Captain Cox that such protection the use of the French Hag are limited to the high seas and ports outside the tewitory erf the Sultan of Ma'skat is one which could be successfully mam- tained ' (Foreign Office to the India Office, dated 27th May 1901). 434-4S5.

On the India Office referring this proposal to the Foreign Office, Lord Lansdowne drew the attention of the India Office to the claim put forward hy the French to exercise the police control over their vessels in Zanzibar waters The Franco-Maskat Treaty of 1646 or any other treaty does not surrender the Sultan's right of police over his waters, but France had in practice exercised the police over their own vessels in Zanzibar waters, being disinclined eXerelS ? ■ t0 ? semi - civilized Power. When however the British eetorate was proclaimed over Zanzibar, there was no reason, from a British point 01 view, to the continuance of the French exercise of police as before in Zanzibar waters. The question then is what has been the usage at Maskat? t ,r ' t3 Zv r I '' l ' rL '' or '. ! u tlle , Fore i? a Office letter dated 17th July 1900, the India Office was informed that the Sultan of Maskat's notification was not to have retrospective effect, except to such of his subjects as bad obtained French papers without_ having a proper claim to them. The second notification proposed to be issued by the Sultan -would, however, in Lord Lansdowne's KM™, 3 reA.vo SV eotW e effect to the notification of June 1900 Moreover it M doubtful whether the issue of a decree by the Sultan of Maskat, and even by the Sultan of lurkey, forbidding to his subjects, who are under the proteo ' a El, J 0 P e an State, the use of the flag of that state in his territorial naters would be accepted by the European Powers. Such a decree would only raise a fresh series of sharp disputes and lead to no beneficial result In XT'SITT Lansdowne suggested that the preferable course would ^ r ^ ! request the French Consul to supply him with a list nf fh# dhow-holders, who are considered entitled to fly the Trench flaff accomTmnpd by a statement of tlie grounds on which the claim is allowed (Foreign Office e.ters to the India Office dated 5th August 1901 and 22nd September^Ol).

On the 4th March J 902, 126. dated sth March 1902. the French Consul and the Commander of Secret e ., April 1902, woa. 78 129 (No, 117). the Cafmat, whiohhad been at Maskat for some time, before leaving for Sur, informed tlie Sultan that they were goin» ' to inform the flag-holders of the Sultan's sovereignty on land.' When Major Cox was informed of this, he enquired of M. Laronce what instructions the French Consul had received on his reference to his Government (see paragraph 442 above). Major Cox also referred to the reported statement made by the Erench Consul and Commander to the Sultan. The reply was that the Jbrench had no intention of subjecting Oman subjects to French jurisdiction and only claimed the right conferred on them by the Brussels Acty the right of surveillance and police over vessels bearing the French flag. 44)4. In reporting these facts to the Goverment of India (letter No. 126, ibid No 117 dated 8th March 1902), Major Cox sug gested issue of notification by the Sultan to the effect that as result of discussion between His Highness and the Govern ments of Great Britian and France, it had been decided that in Maskat terri tory tbe rights of foreign Hag-holders are the same as those of other Maskat subjects. The Viceroy did not think that such a notification wms necessary, but enquired of the Secretary of State if the French Consul's action was con sidered by the French Government (telegram, dated 25th March 1902). 445. The French Flagship Catinat was ordered to be detained at Mnskat at this time, probably, as it was surmised in connection with tbe supervision of Suri dhows flying the flag of France. 446. As regards the surveillance and police of dhows flying French flag. Captain Cox proposed tbat tlie Sultan should suggest to M. Laronce that it would be more convenient if tbe inspection was held in the Maskat harbour, instead of the French Consul spending a month annually among His Highness* subjects at Sur—a proceeding which was likely to be misunderstood bv them (Major Cox's No. 126, dated 8th March). (vii) Correspondence and communications in Europe, 1902. 447. On 12th March 1902, the French Ambassador made a communication to Lord Lansdowne to the effect thnt a Monson. careful watch had been kept on the Suri dhows flying the French flag, and that it had been proved that there was no ground for suspecting them of being engaged in slave traffic, and that the French Consuls had, moreover, bepn engaged for some time in carefully revising all these papers. The work was nearly finished and no new certificates would he granted' 448. Referring to this communication it was observed in the India Office letter, dated 25th March 1902, to the Foreign Otiice ^' s p res umed that this assurance confirms that, previoaslv given to Lord Salisbury bv . Camboti on 2Cth June 1900, and that no certificates will be recognized which may have been granted for the first time at a date subsequent to 26tli June 1900. On thisunder- standmg, the points at Ksue are confined to the certificates granted before 26th June 1900, and to the effect of those certi fa Gates. I am to suggest that, if possible, a test of tho P e f erS ^ be obtained, as it is of the ut nost importance to learn the extent this form of French protection has been carried. I am to observe that our Treaty engagements regarding Maskat seem to justify a protest on our part against action by France, which is not compatible with the independence of the Sultan.' 449. On 16th April 1902, Lord Lansdowne handed over to the French Ambassador a memorandum based on Major Cox's report above summarised (paiagn.ph 43J) in reply to the^ communication made by M. Cambon on 14th August 1901. In conclusion it was observed Secret E., September 1903, Nos. 240-383, Foreign Office Despatch to bir E. Ko ]04, dated 12th March 1902. Ihid, No 240, Euclosuie 6. These matters are, however, only of subsidiary importance, and while His Maiestv's stion, the two (jovernments are practically in accord : W ne lZTonh7tl h at l fndu M Z n h' nt ' ence oj tht imlian, and to aid htm m consolidating his authority.95 '(6) Thot the French Qo^ernment i* determined to faJc all necessary precaulinns for preventing slave trading tinder the cover of the trench flig. '(e) That no fresh papers of protection to Sun or Maskat dhows have hew issued since June 1900 and that the practice. wiU be discontinued for the future. ' [d) That careful examination is biing wade as the validity of the present claims to protection based on the possession of French papers given prior to Jane WOO. u {e) Thatno right of protection ou shore or in the territorial waters of Masqat is claimed hy the French Government in. respect of the subjects of the Saltan of Maskat holding such papers, and that within the Sultan s territory *h'y are to be regarded as subject to his ordinary ju/isdictivn.' A request was also made 'hat a list of the dhows and their owners considered to be enti'led to the use of the French flag might be furnished to the Sultan, as also to the British. Consul for the information of the British cruisers stationed in those waters. 450. When the above memorandum was read to M. Cambon, His Ex- cellency'listened to it with evident approbation, but somowhaj; demurred to the pronosition as to the right to French protection claimed by Trench flag holders in Maskat territory, He promised, however, to consider carefully what was said in the memorandum. 451. In an interview which .Lord I/msdowne had had with the French Ambass'»dor on 26th November 2902, a iliii. No. 2C8. reference was made to the information re ceived from the Sultan of Maskat about fresh French papers given to two Suris. The French Ambassador assured that the French Government were not eivinsr papers to any dhows which did not already possess them, although in one or two cases new papers had been taken out to replace old ones, either be cause the old ones had been damaged or for some other equally sufficient reason. 452. The French Ambassador laid stress on the unofficial character of the communications between him and the Foreign Office and on the necessity of bearing in mind that no other Powers had the right to interfere in the dispute arising 3 from flag question (Foreign Office to Sir F. Monson, No. 485-A, dated 9th December 190 O- (viii) Capture of Oman slave rnimers in Portuguese East Africa, 1903. 453 The Portuguese authorities of Mozambique having received informa tion about the middle of February 1902 ot the presence of a flotilla of suspicions look- secret e., May 1904, Ncs. 75-i2i (No. no). j no . 4 ra h vessels anchored in a small mleu of Sanmeo Bay, an expedition was organized of 3 Portuguese mea-of-war, the Sao Uaphaei;Liberal andGhaimate against the Arab vessels, Xwelye ot tkis dhows were captured, and 725 slaves in chains were liberated. Ihe Arabs took to flight, and after a hot pursuit 114 of them were captured. 454. A few days afterwards a dhow called Fateh Sal am was captured in the neighbourhood bv the Commandant of Momah, with large quantity of arms and incriminating documents. Seventeen Arabs were made prisoners on the Fateh Salam. 456. Of the prisoners captured by the Sao Baphael \03 were tried lathe Court of Mozambique and sentenced each to 25 years transportation on lUh September 1903. The second batch of prisoners were sentenced m 1903 to 17 years* transportation and sent to Angola. 456 There were extraordinary delays between the days of their respective captures and their trial, which were attributed partly to the temporary absence ot the competent judge and partly to magnitude of the task of taking down evidence of a large number of witnesses. 457 His Maiesty's Government did not consider that the punishments inflicted under the Portuguese Penal Code, 1886 in force Mozambique were excessive, and the Sultan who was much interested in the matter was informed accordingly (Captain Grey's letter No. 344, dated 18th July 1904).96 458. It is a significant, fact that the maj ority cf the prisoners belonged to the Jencheh tribe of the Arabs at Sur and that some of the Arabs captured by the Portuguese, as Major Cox was informed by the French Consul at Muskat, claimed to be French proteges. On the French Consul at Zanzibar enquiring in tbe matter, it was found that they were not really entitled to protection. These cases were typical of what was constantly happening, namely, of Arab dhows, to escape the inconvenient attention of the British cruisers, were run- nimr up French flags, whether they were entitled to them or not and thus carried on slave traffic with impunity owing to the inadequacy of the French policing. M. Laronce admitted that the contingency was a possible one, but did not think that such a thing occurred frequently. 459. The facts, in Major Cox's opinion, suggested the necessity of obtain- ing from the French Government an authentic list of the Omani subjects en titled to possess French flags and papers, with a statement of the grounds on which each flag has been given and the nature and extent of the rights and privileges which they claim for their proteges. 460. Major Cox also lepea'ed the sugfrestion he had made once before in his letter No. 488, dated 28th September 1903, that a British Agent, an Eng. lishmnn or ^wcw-Englishman, should be appointed at Sur. If this proposal was not feasible Major Cox suggested that the Head Clerk of the Consulate might be appointed Superintendent Fice- Consul, with a slight increase of salary who might be deputed occasionally to Sur. 4 1. On this proposal of an Agent at Sur, it was decided by the Govern- ibid No 251 ment of India to await Colonel Kemball's opinion. Major Cox's other suggestion as to obtaining a list of Omanis entitled to hold the French flag was strongly press ed upon the attention of the Secretary of State. As also a report had been received from the Sultan that French flags had been recently given to two Sm is, who had never had them before, the Government of India proposed that a strong protest should be issued against the issue of new papers to the Saltan's subjects (despatch to the Secretary of State, ISo. 18i (Secret—External), dated 9th October &lt;902), 462. In view of the recent evidence of active slave traffic carried by Oraani IM. No. M. 269 (No. res,. 4?? bs ' M, '&gt; r Cox thon 8 ,,t that the acqui- sition by the Sultan of an armed steamer* would probably enable him to establish his authority on a firmer basis along the Oman Coast and that the opportunity would be a fitting one for a reminder being addressed by the Viceroy to His Highness of his obligation in the matter of suppressing the slave traffic in his dominions (Captain Cox to Colonel Kem ball, No. 373, dated 29th August 1902). Colonel Kemball approved of this proposal. But the Government of India thought that Major Cox himself might make the necessary communication as embodying the views and wishes of the Governor General iu Council (letter No. 22ll-E M dated 11th November 1902). (ix) Jurisdiction over French fiag-holderst in Zanzibar. 463. In a suit for recovery of debt filed before the Zanzibar Sultan's Court secret e., september 1903, Nos. 240-383 (No. of delegated jurisdiction by a British 2(&gt;7 ctsaq.) ^ Indian against one Juina-bin-Mubarak, the latter claimed to be a French protege, having resided often in Comoro and being entitled to fly 1 reneh colours on his dhow, though he was a Suri bv na tionality, and questioned the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with his case. The Couit, how ever, held that notwithstanding his being a Captain of a dhow flying the French fiag and his alleged residence in Comoro, the defendent could not withdiaw fiom tiie Sultan s civil jurisdiction. The French Consul pro tested against this action of the Court but Mr. Cave explained to him that he could not interfere with the Courts' authority in the matter, nor that he could admit the claim to extra-territorial juri diction over a Suri, simply because he was Captain of a vessel flying the F rench flag : he was neither a Frenchman, nor * See paracrvaph 4 29, antr t and paragraph 626, post. t See paragraph 436, ante.97 in the service of a Frencbman or a native of Comoro, nor could a Suri have title to flv a Trench flag under Article XXXII of the Brussels Act, under which the flaAolder should either be a French subject or French protected person, which a Suri a subject of the Sultan of Maskat, could not be (see Mr. Cave s letters to the French Consul, dated 15th September and 16tli September 1902). (z) French Flag incidents at Bur and Maskat. Proposed reference to the Eagua Conference, 1903-1904. 464. In April 1903, the French flag question entered an acute stage, when 1 to avoid inter-tribal difficulties that had secret e ., May 1904, Nos. 75-121. arisen between Abdullah-bin-Salem, the Sheikh and some of his tribesmen, one of the tribesmen, Mubarak-bm- Hatned tried to flee from Sur in a dhow of his son, flying the French flag, TI p nf Sheikh Abdullah 's men fired at the dhow and the shot passed through I Cnchtf A complaint was thereupon lodged by Mubarak against the Sheikh before the French Consul, who demanded compensation for the deten tion of the vessel. The Sultan refused the demand peremptorily. . 465. In the same month a French flag-holder belonging to Snr, who had v^ VliLlcat and who was snbiect to quarantine broke quarantine himself arrived at Maskat and wno j ^ abducting two followers from Secret E, September loos, hoi. - ^ quarantine station absconded. At the Sultan's desire Major Cox arranged ^htoe Commander of thej^^to send imprisoned The French Consul 'demanded the release of the men, but the demand was refused. , ,, _ , . , i 466. The matter was then taken up in London by the French Ambassadrm After discussion in the Cabinet, .Lord ibid. No. 342.

[C973FD]98 468. On the 3rd August, Major Cox. in view of the probable delay in the ~ . * qao settlement of the Prench flag questiou. Major C ox'b No 375, dated 3rd Angust 1903. • j t ai , t /&gt; it enquired whether, pending a final deci sion of the Tribunal and in the event of an unavoidabJe occasion arising, the Sultan need differentiate between French ilag-holders and other subjects. He presumed that there was no need for dilTerentiation, and the Government of India agreed in this, but the matter was referred to the Secretary of State, who replied that, pending arbitration, action on the part of the Saltan, which would tend to prejudice the question of the privileges of the flag-holders, would be most undesirable, and asked that Major Cox might be instructed in the case contemplated to use his influence to restrain the Sultan from taking IMd No 85f any precipitate action and to refer the matter for orders (telegram dated 3rd September 1903). 469. Erom a despatch from Major Cox, dated Maskat, 18th September 1903, it appears that, whereas Mesnaa, where the Sultan had for some time past been anchored in his steamer, is altogether out of the way for vessels sailing from Maskat to Basrah ; nevertheless, during the fortnight pnst every French dhow from Sur, after calling at Maskat according to custom, had sailed for Basrah via Mesnaa, and on approaching the ' Noor-el-Bahr' had run up the French flag and sailed past right under the bows of the latter, with no other possible purpose than to defy and annoy the Sultan. Moreover, when His Majesty's ship 44 Sphinx ' was anchored close by, those that passed even took the trouble to steer between her and the 44 Noor-el Bahr.' Major Cos himself saw about fifteen of these French dhows while there, and the Sultan positively declared that, during the whole period of his sojourn at Mesnaa, not less than fifty of them had passed him in this way, whereas the French do not admit more than thirty-three. It is hardly to be wondered at that Sayyid Faisal should have been intensely annoyed at the defiance of these people and at his own impotence to take any action against them, and he did not attempt to conceal his feelings. 470. On 5th September 1903, on his return to Maskat after a few days' Extract of Despatch from Major Cox, daiid a ^ Sence 0n the Batinell COast, Major CoX Maikat, September isth, 1903. received an informal communication from ^Proceedings No. 18, Secret E., May 1904, Nos. 75- M&gt; LarOUCO about tWO negrOBS who had taken refuge in the British Con- sulfite over whom the French Council claimed to exercise jurisdiction, beino' members of a crew flying tiie French flag. They both claimed to be slaves', stating that they had escaped from their dhow at Mattra in broad daylight, and had come straight to the Consuiate with nothing on them or with them' but their loin-cloths and smocks, and that the accusation of theft made against them was without any foundation, or possibility of foundation, and wns merely the invariable allegation of a master from whom a slave has absconded. 4,' j L As the relations between Major Cox and M. liaronce had alwavs been most iriendly, he thouerht that the best thing, under the circumstances, would be for him to go and talk the matter over with him personally, instead of entering into awkward correspondence with him on the subject This he accordingly did. 472. He told him that, on getting his note, he had ascertained that the men were actually at the Consulate, that they both claimed to be slaves, and had given an approximately identical account of the cause and means of their escape, and altogether denied the alleged theft and the possibility of its having taken place. That the only and the proper course to be pursued was that he should, on the Saltan s return, send them over to him according to invariable customs, either for acquiescence in their freedom, or for the production of adequate evidence to prove that they were not slaves, or were not entitled to freedom, that M. Laronce^ could then send such evidence as he had to the Sultan, and that if the Sultan, m pursuance of that evidence, could give him adequate reasons lor not granting them freedom, he would refuse them manumis sion papers.99 473. There the matter rested until the Sultan's return in the 'Noor-el* Bahr ' for brief visit on urgent business connected with tho troubles at Rostak. This was on the 7th September. Ti.e Sultan however excused himself on tbo ground of a pressure of other more urgent work and having to leave Aiaskat again at once. 474. On Monday forenoon, the 14th September, two or three of the khalassis of the French Consulate pursued through the bazaar one of the two Suri negroes in question, Moosa, who was making for the British Consulate, and ultimately caught him and led him off to the Irench Consul, ibe other Sun ne^ro was found absent from the Consulate, and arrested outside the precincts of the Consulate. As Major Cok was on the point of leaving Maskat, he went over to see M. Laronce, and asked him whether the negroes had been arrested bv his orders. He said, « Yes; he had given the orders, and believed that h^ was within his right in arresting them, as both yesterday and to-day they had been seen outside the British Consulate.' Major Cox pointed out J; bat view of the amicable arrangement which they had come to with regard to he disnosal of the negroes, M. Laronce's action was somewhat questionable trom the point of view of a Consular colleague; and that, in the second place, one of the negroes, at all events, as soon as he quitted the sanctuary of the British Consulate had become a subject of the Sultan of Maskat. M. r ®P ea ^ that he was sure he was within his rights, and could not admit that he was altering the status quo in any way, and that one negro be had already sent ove fn fho Sultan's brother, with the request that he would give him a month s imprisoiiment for robbery, and recover the stolen money trom him; after which he did not care what became of him, and that Major Cox could ' ree ^ ® wished. He said he regarded the other man, the native of Camoio, as a i leneh subject, and would keep him at his own house. 475. On leaving M. Laronce, Major Cox learnt that the Sultan's brother j 7 inviomc in tbp rouffh-and-ready manner characteristic of him, had at and locum tenens ^e wugh and e c y isitioll) without asking T I™ r w^ e^ence there wa S against him, or making any other inouirv Major Cox left for the Batineh Coast a few minutes later, and fell in with the Sultan ^^^rat the ml' without Kryf a^d ^pressed his intention of addressing the French Consul about it on bis return. This was accordingly done. 476 Immediately on receipt of the Sultan's letter, M. Laronce sent a note , tt;J ni&lt;rhtioss savin' that he would like to call on him m reply, and an mter- l ew ^ ac&lt;orai7gly 0 granted that, evening. His Highness informed Major view was accor u s b d re2ret f or the seizure of the man, and Cox that M. Laronc ^ ^ ^ TTia-Vmess. He continued that he assured him that he mean u0 o ® helieved tlfe two negroes to be robbers, but had taken the action was unfounded.

They were accordingly man) whom he naa nnuex u acQU i eS eed in the manumission of the man Moosf The otor man was allarge also, and had possibly received a free paper from M. Laronce. 477'.

The other man was manumitted on his release from the confinement in which he had been kept at the French Co isul's request. 477B. Having regard to the circumstances in which the negroes took refuge in the British Consulate and to the communications which passed between M. Laronce and Major Cox at the time, Mr. Brodrick hoped that Lord Lans- downe would concur in the opinion that Major Cox's action in giving shelter to the men, pending the settlement of the question of their manumission, was justified (India Office to the Foreign Office, dated 29th March 1904). 478. On the 11th April 1904 an altercation took place in a bania's shop at Prom Captain Grey to the GoTernment of India, Sur between the proprietor's voun o, er bro- Ho 185, dated 25ih iprii 1904. ther and a young , Vra ) ); named Hamed bin All Habia of the Jennebeh tribe, whose father was one of the French flagholders According to the bank's account it appears that after high words on both sides the Arab attacked him with a stick which he wrenched awav from him Hamed then drew his dagger and struck his opponent in the neck, mflicting a wound about 3 inches in depth. According to the Arab, the bania first wounded him with a sword. On the same evening the bania's elder brother and the father of Hamed both left for Maskat to prefer complaints ; the former came on his arrival to the British Consulate office, and the latter took refuge at the French Vice-Consulate, where he remained for foar days, then returned to Sur. The bania returned to Sur on the Hih. and, as the consequence of representations made the British Consul to the Sultan, with him went a messen ger from His Highness to his Wali and Qazi at Sur directing them to send Hamed bin All s father to him at Maskat. They both replied to the effect that the father, acting under the advice of the Jennebeh bheikhs refused to send his son to Maskat, and had placed the matter 111 the hands of the French Vice-Consul, and the Sultan shewed Captain Grey a letter from oneof the Sheikhs of the Jennebeh tribe to himself which stated tuat they had disposed of the case accordingly, and suggesting that the Christians should fight it out among themselves.' Meanwhile M Laronce had written to the Jennebeh saying that he was coming shortlv to Sur and u t0 * h ! + f aSe A ^ e . left Ma . skat on 27th b April soon after he infoimed tlie Sultan that the Arab m question was not a French protege and that he had therefore declined to take up his case. 479. The Jennebeh tribe is divided into four sub-divisiocs, Al-Favvaaris a.KhX wor™'''' ot No - iil - Arama &gt; Al-Ghialeen and Al-Makhl -i-i , anna. Each subdivision contains French flag-holders, the greater number belonging to the Makhanna. 430.

[C973FD]p-l Telegram, dated 10th April 1S04. 102 483. Lieutenant-Colonel A. Kemball, C.I.E., Persian Gulf, expressed the following opinion (telegram, dated 5th April) From local point of view, it is difficult to say how draft articles can be amended eo as to be accept;ible as it seems to give away Sultan's case, in which we have encouraged him to expect our support. If, however, reasons of State render it necessary to accept some such article, following points ommr to me— Clause 2. —The phrase ' without any previous understanding with him' seems too vague, unless the qualiBoations are more precisely determined. Contention is that Maskat subjects are given French flags too easily—see enclosure 1, Cox's letter, dated 2nd January 1902. Some property limits and period qualifying for residence might be imposed. Claase 3 —Provision should be made that such French proteges should be subject to the Sultan's municipal laws on Maskat soil. Contention is that possesion of French flags enables holders to evade Sultan's authority in many ways. Some limitation of the extension of protection is also desirable. Might not this be limited to children and grand-children of proteges? Clause 5 SHeras too vague. 1 think that it should be clearly understood that title is defective when it does not conform to qualifications judged to be essential under clause 2. It is not clear to me what is the precise meaning of non re»ewal of papers. It is to be under stood that French protection will be immediately withdrawn, or will papers not be renewed on expiration of the year—see Article 3S, Brussels Act—or is French protection to hold good for lifetime of holder, whose title is shown to be defective ? 484. Captain Grey was of opinion that Clauses I and II would do, but that words ' without previous under standing with him ' would probably lead to trouble. Could they be omitted ? As to Clause III, he could not recon cile the proposal for French protection with Clause I. The suggestion of protection of proprietor, whilst on Oman territory, was a further step to undermine Sultan's independence, to which he could not consent. Otherwise Captain Grey thought Article would be acceptable to the Sultan of Maskat. 485. His Excellency the Viceroy telegraphed to the Secretary of State on 13th April, in reply to the Secretary of State's telegram of 30th March Owing to the absence of the Political Agent from Maskat, it has been impossible to reply to it. He has not yet returned and we have no indication of his view or those of the Sultan. We are of opinion that it is also important to consult Major Cox, who is on the sea, returning to India. For the following reasons, however, we strongly deprecate any such arrangement as that proposed :— (1) Reference to the Hague Arbitration can hardly be cancelled without the consent of the Sultan who would almost certainly object to proposed solution and would consider we had again given him away. (S) We have no record of reciprocal engagement of the 5th August 1890, and do not know what it was. At the very time when we have been trying to escape from dual control it would seem to be most unfortunate to renew the declaration of 1862 which would indefinitely postpone any solution such as we desire. (3) Arrangement seems altogether one-sided. The French offer a list of fla^-holders in two months' time, although Ambassador told Lord Lansdowne it was alreadv prepared on 18th May 1908. They also repeat the promise to issue no more nags without an understanding with Sultan which was reported by you on the 2bth May last. In return for this we are to recognise French right to protect both on land and in territorial waters not only owners of dhows carrving French nag but the Sultan s subjects residing or owning pr perty in French colonies such protection to be extended to families. This would seem to involve full concession of French claims which Lord Lansdowne on 19th May 1903 said n\s Majesty s Government were quite unable to understand. Further, we do not grasp the proposal not to renew papers if the title is defective. Would thev be cancelled at the end of the year or would permission last for the lifetime of the Hag-homers r \\ e do not see what protection is required for the French flasr- holders beyond that conferred by Article XXX ei seq. of the Brussels Act It would seem from every point of view preferable to persist in reference to the Hague Iribunal rather than make an arrangement which is sure to be regarded locally as British surrender and which will give infinite trouble in future.

Captain Grey added that the ^Infernet'* was expected shortly at Maskat, and would, he believed, proceed to Debai. Colonel Kemhall recom mended that, as he belieyed the French Consul was unaware of the engagements by which the Trucial Chiefs are precluded from entering into correspondence with any Foreign Power, he should inform M. Laronce of our agreements, and express his willingness to make enquiry and do his best to settle the matter if particulars were furnished. The Resident was authorised to proceed m the manner proposed, and the facts were reported by telegraph to the Secretary ot State with a suggestion that situation should be explained to the irencn brov- emment. 488. On the 15th April, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed that the French Gov ernment were unaware of our treaty engagements with the Sheikh, and agreed to the settlement of the incident by His Majesty's Government without their intervention. They asked that the Sheikh might at once be caused to give satisfaction, and that intimation might then be made to them of the settlement effected. In the meanwhile, they undertook to delay the arrival of the cruiser which had not yet reached Maskat. 489. On the 14th May, Captain Grey reported that the Debai incident had been satisfactorily settled by the decision, of a Religious Court granting All- nn- Salira an award of 800 dollars, which he accepted. The French Consul agreed with Captain Grey in thinking that this settlement closed the incident. 490. It is interesting to note that the French flag and papers, which formed fhfl Tttpfext for intervention by the French Consul, appear originally to have been grantedlo ono Sahm-hinlaho^ On his death in 1.02 his boat passed hv inheritance to his eldest son, Ali -bin-Sahm, who had since flown the French flag, and now claimed, moreover, the right to transfer it to a new vessel which he had procured to replace that wrecked at Debai. 491 The Secretary of State was addressed on the llth August regard ing the action of Ali -bfn-Salim who after the destruction of his vesse transfer red to a new ship the French flag ongiQahypantedtobisfathe^It was suggested that besides the question whether the right to ^ a ^ en ° h i ^ descends bv inheritance, that of transferring it to a new craft, and olso the issue a holder can fly the flag on all boats that he may possess or claim to own S hfreferred! among other points, for a decision by the Hague Tribunal.

The following is the text of the Agreement signed by the Marquess of Lansdowne and the French Ambas- Ilid, No. 180. sador:— Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the French Republic have thought it right, by the Declaration of the 10th March, 18G2, 'to engage reciprocally to respect the independence ' of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat; And whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat of papers authorising them to fly the French flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of his Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects : The undersigned, being duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, hereby agree that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of Article I of the Convention concluded between the two countries on the 14th October last, and that the decision of the Hague Tribunal shall be final. It is also hereby agreed as follows ARTICLE I.

Award of the tribunal of arbitration const eig „ e( l at London on October 13th, 1904, between Great Britain and France. The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in -virtue of the Compromise con cluded at London on October 13th, 1904. between Great Britain and i ranee : Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the French Renublic have thought it right by the Declaration of March 10, to engage reciprocally to respect the independence ' of His Highness the Su.tan of Mask at. Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration haye ' ls ^. ^ relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain sabjec s ^His High. ness the Sultan of Maskat of papers authorizing them to_ fly the l | en ® 1 ? and also as to the nature ot the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Hkhness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers ot are members of the crew of such dhows and their iamihes especiaUy L to the manner in which such privileges and immunities aifect the ju diction ot His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects.

Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons pro tected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly, 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable, 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of slave trade. Whereas in default of a definition of the term ' protege ' in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be understood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Einal Act, as to the principles of the law of nations, as they have been expressed in treaties existing at that time, in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice, Whereas the aim of the said article 32 is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by slave trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State, under whose flag they are sailing, Whereas since the restriction which the term ' proteg^ ' underwent in virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 186H, 1865, and 1869, especially of the Ottoman law of 23 Sefer 1280 (August 1863) implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty concluded between France and Morocco in 1863, to which a great number of' other Powers have acceded and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of July 30, 1880, the term ' protege ' embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes 1°. persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim, 2°. individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the treaties with Morocco of I860 and 1880 and in the Ottoman law of 1863, 3°. persons, who under a special treaty have been recognized as ' proteges n like those enumerated by article 4 of the French Maskat Convention of 1844 and 4°. those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as ' proteges ' by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new ' proteges ' was regulated and limited, that is to say before the year 1863, these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired. Whereas that, although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exer cise of the pretended right to create ' proteges ' in unlimited number only m109 rplation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless tlie exercise of this pretended ricrht has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, ^ aTialogy havine always been recognized as a means to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous, Whereas on the other band the concession de facto made by Turkey, fbit the status of ' proteges' be transmitted to the descendants of persons, wno in 1863 had enjoyed the proteetion of a Christian 1W, cannot he extended by ftnnloP'v to Mask at, where the circumstances are entirely dissimilar, the p Whereas the dispositions of article 4 of the rrencb-Maskat Treaty of 184^ nTllv t0 persons who are bond fide in the service of Erencb subjects, but not to persons who a-k for ships' papers for the purpose of doing any commercial business, TT t i, e f ao t of having sranted before the ratification of the Brussels Act .15™..?!, r«:..», a. not satisfying the conditions prescribed by article 32 of contradiction with any international obligation of Trance.

The list and proclamation would be subject to the approval of the British and French Governments, to whom would be referred doubtful points arising in course of preparation. 510 22. At the same time tha Government of India addressed the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf on the steps ibid, No. 320. w}iicli ]ae p r0 p 0Se( i should be taken to give effect to the award (No. 3868-E.B., dated 17th October 1905). They agreed with him that it might ultimately be necessary to exer cise some vigilance with a view to securing the assertion by the Sultan of his full rights under the award ; but they pointed out to him that the first step to be taken should be for Major Grey and M. Laronce to endeavour to arrive at an understanding on all points of doubtful interpretation, and also on the Public notification which it was proposed should be issued by the Sultan, when necessary, reference could be made to the Government of India for guidance. In regard to a proposal made by that the French flag should not be flown in the creek which divides the two settlement at Sur, the Government of India stated that they could hardly see their way, with the present data before them, to express any opinion on the proposal. They thought that the nght to fly th French flag would presumably continue to be the same m all parts of the ter torial waters of Maskat, and it waa unlikely tbat the Prcnoh ^ G 7 crn o '! 1 ^ t J,^ 1 had already been deprived of a substantial portion of the rights claimoa by th , would consent to a further diminution of these without a f detailed report on this question was accordingly called for; as also on the pioposal to appoint a British ofiicer at Sur.

Erench Intrigues, 190i. 523. In January 1901 Captain Cox brought to the notice of the Govern- Q it. * ■iium v i-i Q ioo ment of India the existence of coal-fields Secret E., April 1901, Nos. 118-122. . c t -r» p i i r-, at Kafseh or Eufsheh near bur. The idea of a coal trade from this coast suggested to Captain Cox advan tageous possibilities in three directions:— (i) It would be an obviously convenient source of supply for our coal depots in these waters. (ii) It would considerably improve the independent financial position of the Sultan. (iii) It would be the means of shedding, in some degree, the light of civilisation and publicity upon the port of Sur, a spot which has hitherto borne a time-honoured and unenviable notorietv as the • i 0 principal emporium for the supply of Negro slaves to meet the demand for thecn in Eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Apart from the above considerations, moreover, the existence of coal in maritime range behind Sur and the vicinity had an indirect bearing on the French flag question, and in that connection to accentuate in no small degree the undesirabilily of our allowing the French or any other maritime power to raise a coramuniry or proteges, and thus gain a footing and influence on that part of the coats of Oman. 524. On the matter being referred to them, the Government of India, seorfit e„ august 1901, t)„,. iti -sos. consented to afford His Highness the ne- cessary assistance in determining the value of the seams, and decided to depute a mining expert to examine and report upon them. 526. The two expeditions subsequently undertaken having already been Secret B.. September 1901, Nos. 82-88. reported upon in detail, it seems unneces sary to record more here than a short out line of what occurred from the Gulf Ilesidency Administration Eeport for 1901-02. 1 (F irst E xpedition.) 527. On the first occasion, the Geologist deputed was Dr. A. Von Krafft, Gulf administration report for 1901-02. 1 h. O., of tllb Geological bui'VeV of India who arrived in Maskat on 10th April. After waiting three days in the hope that the arrival of one of His Majesty's ships for duty in Maskat would have enabled him and Captain Cox to get down to Sur expeditiously, they were eventually obliged to leave by dhow on l^th April. 528. In the first locality which they visited,—Kalhat, about 60 miles south-east of Maskat,—they were received in the most friendly way by the local tribesmen, but from the moment they entered the Musharifeh country near Sur the party met with the utmost hostility and obstruction. It appeared that the disaffected community at that port had circulated among the Sheikhs of the Sharkiyeh, fantastic and sinister misrepresentations of their motives ia exploring the country, and the Sultan's old enemies, Aysa-bin-Saleh (son and successor of the rebel leader who led the operations against Maskat in 1895) and Hilal and Mohsin, the sons of Amr, partly perhaps beiieviag these stories, and partly no doubt perceiving that a good opportunity was afforded them for giving play to tneir enmity to the Sultan and making things unpleasant for him, came^ down with a following from the Sharkiyeh, and preached a petty Jehad againsi them among the ignorant Musharifeh Bedouins through whose country their route to the coal seams lay.113 529. Amon^ tbe various canards circulated was one to tVie effect that tlie Sultan was in collusion with the British Government to sell Sur to them, and that the coal-bearing tract was being exploited in connection with a railway to be constructed from Sur, and thence round through the Sharkiyeh to Maskat. 530. A whole month was spent in the most trying negotiations and in patiently endeavouring to overcome, first the suspicions of the tribes, and sub sequently the cupidity of Aysa-bin-Saleh and his companions. At last, with tbe assistance of the Sultan, who was good enough to come down to Sur by mail steamer to assist the party and to depute his son Sayy id Taimoor to accom pany them throughout, they managed to reach the goal, but not until they had'been ambuscaded and fired at, just as they were entering the hills m which the coal is found. Once having been permitted to set foot in the tract, it might have been expected that they should have been left to continue their work unmolested; but the tribal feeling among the ignorant Musharifeh had been roused to such a pitch of inflammability by the malevolent preaching ot the disloyal Hinawi Sheikhs, and rifles were emptied on such slight provoca tion that it became impossible under such conditions to conduct any sustained eeological examination of the district, and they were obliged to content them selves with a superficial examination of the deposits, and a collection of samples of the coal; returning to Maskat with the Sultan on 25th May after an absence of seven weeks. (S econd E xpedition.) 5S1 On receiving Dr. von Krafft's report, the Government oE India felt that the evidence obtained of the extent and quality of the deposits was not of a sufficiently complete nature to enable them to give satisfactory advice to the SnCn in the matter ; it was therefore decided, as soon as tbe cold weather set ^ to despatch another expedition, and Dr. von Krafft was again depu ted. Tin fort imitelv he died very suddenly when on the point of staitmg from Inuia, Md Mr K D Oldham, also of the Geological Survey of India, took up tbe work in his place. possible trade in coal which i ^ an-rrp time arranged to rendezvous Je^'B^ar Eas-el-Haad.'from which point it was decided to afalc™a start, the road being reported better for transport than that leading from Sur. . , , 533.

It was arranged, however, that they should land at Daghmar near Kurriyat and return to Maskat via the Devil's Gap, the Wadi Tyin, and the Semail Valley. Accordingly, disembarking from His Majesty's S. S. Lapwing at Daghmar, on 1st December, they reached Maskat on 10th idem, after an inter esting journey of 150 miles. They were most hospitably received by the tribes on their route, except at one of the small villages in the Wadi Tyin, named Akda, inhabited by 30 or 40 of the Beni Umar Battash. 537. They had two Sheikhs of the tribe with them as ' Khafeers,' and in the other villages of this tribe they had been welcomed, but this particular hamlet seemed to be inhabited by a community of ignorant and turbulent char acters, who turned out en masse with their matchlocks, and barred the way to their caravan and baggage guard, which was winding peacefully along the 'Wadi Tyin, waiting for orders to halt for the night. 538. No harm had resulted when the party arrived on the scene, but the villagers with the fuses of their matchlocks lighted were in a very excited state, and had one rifle been discharged, on purpose or by accident, it would have inevitably resulted in a general fusilade and a good deal of bloodshed. 539. As it was, after an hour's delay, the party passed through to the next village of the same tribe, where the inhabitants made them welcome and were profuse in their apologies for the behaviour of their neighbours, who were also subsequently said to be craving for pardon. The excuse given was that the villagers had received no previous warning of their approach, and were alarmed and suspicious at the arrival of such a large caravan in their midst. Such a plea might have been accepted for a momentary scare, but it was no adequate reason for their maintaining their offensive attitude after the arrival of their own tribal elders on the scene, and the villagers of the adjoining hamlet, where the party camped for the night, were told to let their comrades know that the matter would not be allowed to rest where it was. 540. Coal was found by Dr. Oldham to occur in tertiary rocks, newest secret e., august 1902, nos. 59-71. rocks of the district, extending from 4 miles north of Migel to 3 miles south of Muswen, 10 miles m all. The quantity seemed very limited, merely pockets in fact which reached good workable thickness in places, but rapidly thinned out. Exposures indicated an area of coal perhaps J mile square with a thick ness of 4 feet and more; say 250,000 tons of workable coal. Conditions of the place were adverse to an easy working of the fields. Khor Jerama to Mus- weh would require 30 and Sur to Musweh 35 miles of railway. There were available neither local labour nor timber, nor firewood nor provisions ; nor even water within 10 or 12 miles. There was no probability of other more continu ous seams in neighbourhood. 541. The Government of India not prepared to proceed further in matter, but directed that the result should be explained to the Sultan and he asked to promise the fiist refusal of concession to the British Government (letter No SSG-B.A., dated 1st February 1902). The Sultan gave the required undertaking (Captain Cox's letter No. 229, dated 31st May 1902). Ohslruction of Doctor von KraffV* work by local tribes attributable to French influence. 542. There is little doubt that the obstructive tactics adopted by the tribes secret e., September 1901, Nos. 1 .27. against the first expedition for the exam- ... r. i -n, , ination of the coal-fields were due to the intrigues of the French. 543. Let us observe the movements of the French vessels of war and the French Consul at the time. The R. F. cruiser Jean Bart arrived at Maskat on the morning of the 16th April 1901, 544. The French Consul returned to Maskat on l Uh April in the mail steamer, bringing with him a number of large packages containing the cuneiform bricks collected by the De Morgan Archseologicai expedition, The packao-es115 t were shipped on tbe Jean Bart, and she left for Sur on the morning of IStli April with the French Cousul and his Dragoman, Abdul Aziz, on board. 545. Captain Cox, accompanied by Dr. von KrafTt bad proceeded to Sur in a buggalow on 14th April; the departure of the Erench Consul was probably hastened by this fact, and from reports of beats from Sur it appears that Mons. Ottavi reached his destination before the British Consul, which contingency the latter was anxious to avoid. 546. On the morning of the 20ih Aprilj the H. E. cruiser Infer net arrived and, in accordance with custom, saluted the Sultan's flag. Short ly after she dropped anchor, Mons. Goguyer, accompanied by a peon from the Erench consulate, proceeded on board. 547. While endeavouring to make due allowance for the bias of his sur- e . t. » .irw. vr oaq roundins^s, Captain Cox could come to no Secret E., August 1901, Noe. 171-208. .. 0 . 1 ., , ,, ..n t ,. other opinion than that the dilhculties recently experienced by Dr. von Krafl't and himself were due in the first instance to the specific efforts of the Erench Consul and Abdul Aziz on arrival at Sur a few days before them, and in the second place, indirectly to the effect of the systematic dissemination for the past year and a half among the Sheikhs of the Sharkiyeh of the notorious Eye-opener ' leaflet, which had acted as an effect ive fertiliser to a naturally productive soil, and made of it a real field for the crop of calumny which the British mission in the neighbourhood of Sur put it in Erench Consul's power to sow. Erom the moment that the British party arrived at Mistook on 21st April, Erench connection with what was passing formed the constant theme of conversation between individuals or groups of Arabs of which Captain Cox was often an unsuspected listener, but the reports of letters and messengers which were from time to time alleged to be passing between the Erench Consulate and the Hinawi Sheikhs were, he was afraid, often unreliable, and he had, therefore, no wish that they should be taken into account in the absence of actual proof, which was not then forthcoming {Political Agent's letter $o. 2Z9, dated 12 th June 1901).llJij it; ^ 116 • • CHAPTER XXII. Certain additional facts connected with the relations of the Prench with the British and the Sultan of Maskat, 1901—1905. (i) Discourteous conduct of the Frenck Consul at Maskat on the proclamation day, 1901.* 548 In his letter No. 36, dated 26th January 1901, Captain Cox, Political secret e., March 1901, Nos. 62-53. ^ ei ^' reported that ever since Jier Majesty was proclaimed Empress of India, the 1st January had been celebrated in Maskat as &lt;5 Queen-Empress's Day,'* as in India, in the following several ways :— {a) The flagstaff at the British Consulate was dressed, and the detach ment of Native Infantry stationed in Maskat parade and fire a feu de joie. (h) The Sultan with bis suite paid an official visit to the British representative ; dressed the flagstaffs on his forts ; fired an Imperial salute of 31 guns, and flew the Union Jack above his Saluting Battery throughout the day. (c) Her Majesty's gun-boat in harbour &lt;( dressed ship' and fired a similar salute. (d) Deputations from the British Indian communities (Hindu and Muhammadan), and the principal weli-disposed Arab subject visited the British representative during the day to express senti ments of loyalty and respect for Her Majesty. (e) The British Consul usually gave a semi-official dinner-party to his colleagues and the officers of Her Majesty's ship in harbour in honour of the occasion. Captain Cox was informed in December 1899 that Mons. Ottavi habitually absented himself on these occasions, but Captain Cox hoped that, as he was then a new arrival in Maskat, he might be inclined to make a fresh start. However, on that occasion, after accepting invitations to dine at this Consulate on Christmas and New Year's days, he left for Seeb just before Christmas, and then wrote in to say that he was too ill to return, ilis Consular flagstaff was not dressed, and he remained away until the night of tiie 1st or morning of the 2nd January, but returned in time to receive a New Year's visit from^the Sultan on the 2nd. In 1900-01 he pursued exactly the same tactics, evading invitations to dine at this Consulate (though he readily accepted at any other time), and refraining from dressing his flagstafT, but returning at nightfall on the 1st so as to obtain the Sultan's New Year's visit on the 2nd. The explanation of bis conduct was that Mons. Ottavi did not recoo-nise Her Majesty the Queen's Imperial status in Maskat, and took upon himself to give expression to this sentiment in the studied manner described. He would not in fact identify himself with any act, such as the dressing of his flao-staff or joining a semi-official gathering of Englishman at this Consulate, which could be ascribed to any recognition on his part of ' Queen -Empress's Dav ' At the same time he took care not to let his own personal or national dignitv suffer by arranging to get back soon enough after 1st January to qualifv for the usual New Year's visit from the Sultan. In a more civilised communitv which would assign to it its proper value, this narrow-minded attitude of the French Consul, though it savoured of international discourtesy, might perhaps be considered beneath specific notice and best ignored, but the position in Maskat was a peculiar one. The public noticed that on the Queen's birthdav Mons. Ottavi (intentionally or otherwise) was always away at Sur (though on this occasion he used to have his flagstaff dressed) and that on the Queen- Empress s day he pointedly absented himself for the occasion and allowed his flagstaff to remain the only one 'undressed,' but yet returned immediately alter nightfall m order to receive the Sultan's visit in the mornin^ —— O * * Cf, discourteous conduct of the Sultan on the same day in 1893-paragraphs 294 -295. A117 On tlie other hand, they noticed that on the French National day the British Consul, and sometimes a British man-of-war, dressed their tiags for the occasion, and that tbe former invariably paid the French Consul a complimentary visit. The interpretation placed upon this contrast of attitude by the ignorant native, to whose undesirable comment Mons. Ottavi recently made such pointed reference in connection with the question of his own salute, was not that the latter's action was a form of discourtesy which we did not trouble to take notice of, or reciprocate, but that it must surely be evidence of the power and independence of the nation whose representative could afford thus habitually to slight Her Majesty or the British Government year after year. Some sacn impression existed and Mons. Ottayi might, it was feared by Captain Cox, be expected to make the most of it. The Political Agent enquired, therefore, whether the Government of India considered that we had sufficient locus standi to invite Foreign Consuls formally on the Queen-Empress's day, as was done on the Queen s birthday, to ' dress ' their flagstaffs for the occasion, and failing that, whether steps should be taken to inform the Sultan, who had himself spontaneously commented to him upon Mons. Ottavi's attitude, that under the circumstances it W (mld be oonsidewd a friendly act on his part if he were to intimate to the Prench Consul that he would be unable to pay him a ^ew Years visit ^future unless he could make it convenient to receive him on New Year s morning, as do the other Consuls. , ^ It must be mentioned that the American Consul dressed bis flagstaff on lat January : not specinllv in honour of tbe Queen-I mpress, but because New Year s day is an American holiday and because the Sultan visited him on that day ' 549 The Government of India, in submitting Captain Cox's report to the Secretary of State, observed (Despatch No. 30.

Dorville, French Vice-Consul at Maskat, towards the Political Agent in connection with certain complaints pr^&amp;rred by British subject against a peon of the French Consulate, 1903^ 552. With his letter No. 333, dated 14th July 1903, Major Cox, Political « . t. r,. v nQ nQ w q K Agent at Maskat, forwarded copies of Secret E., October 1903. Nos. 3-5. 0 , - i - i 1 , correspondence which had passed between himself and the French Vice-Consul in connection with certain complaints pre ferred by two British subjects against a cavass or peon in his employ. In the case of Mons. Dorville's predecessors in office the British and French Consuls had always been able to dispose of such petty cases as those under reference by means of demi-official communicatiou either verbal or written ; and in that way cases had been settled promptly and satisfactorily. Mons. Dorville preferred to correspond officially, and to that course thoueh there were no reasonable grounds for taking exception, yet he had, in otl e' ways, shown a tendency to be both obstructive and discourteous iu his attitude, and to be disinclined to do justice to complaints of British subjects which had been referred to him. The claim of Kalyanji Govindji against his peon for 40 dollars was, in accordance with previous usage, sent over to Mons. Dorville with a polite note on 15th April for favour of inquiry and disposal. For one reason and another its disposal was delayed until 1st July when, after three weeks' silence, Mons. Dorville wrote to Major Cox demi-officially late in the evening saying that he would decide the case at 10 a.m . nest day and asking him to send over com plainant, his witnesses, and an interpreter. It was very short notice to give as the two witnesses were subjects of the Local Government, to whom he had to apply, but he managed to collect them at the Consulate at 9 a.m., so as to make sure of their being in time. When the interpreter started to take them across to the French Consulate, one of the witnesses had disappeared to get a drink of water and made the party five or six minutes late. Major Cox, however, wrote a private note to Mons. Dorville and therein apologised for this delay at the time. He, however, sent the parties away without a hearing, and, in the evening, in spite of the note of apology, sent Major Cox an official communi cation to the effect that the parties not having appeared up to time he had struck the case off the file. In the morning Major Cox walked over to see Mons. Dorville with his letter in his pocket and said that, in view of the private note apologising for the delay, he was much surprised to receive it, and that in any case it was difficult for him to accept it as a just solution of the case. At first Mons. Dorville said he could not reconsider the matter, but Major Cox replied in as friendly a way as he could that if it was not to remain with Mr. Dorville, he should have to reply to it or take other action on it, and that it seemed to him a great pity that, while their countrymen were feting their respective rulers at home, they here in Maskat should allow differences to come between them regarding petty matters like this, which might easily be arranged in amicable conversation. After some further excuses he finally consented to take his official letter back and said he would hear the case again in a week's time. Before the week was up, however, he wrote to inform Major Cox that the cavass had been discharged from the employ of his Consulate and might be proceeded with through the Sultan. Setting aside any discourtesy which his action seemed to involve, the Political Agent asked for the views of Government of India as to whether the principle which his colleague suggested was one that could be propeiiv accepted. * 553. The Government of India were of opinion that as the cavass had since been dismissed by Mr. Dorville the complainants had their remedy in the local courts nothing would be gained by entering into a further discussion with the French Consul either on the subject of the particular case or on that of any principle involved by his action (No. 1765-E., dated 4th August 1903).119 (iv) Doings of M. Goguyer at Maskat. His proposed esp ulsion from Maskak 1839—1905. 551. M. Antoin Goguyer, a French adventurer, has been ^ most active „ at Maskat and elsewhere in promoting Secret E., July 1899, No # . 37o.457. p r ench commercial and political interests. He made his appearance at Maskat in 1899, and undertook with the local merchants to push on and protect the traffic in arms under the shelter of the French fla^.

Captain Cox, however, saw no prospects of the opening of a direct traffic of European goods between Europe and Maskat as the small quantities of goods required for Oman could be obtained more cheaply by way of Bombay. 656. Another occupation M. Qoguyer was engaged in was as a correspondent _ __ . ionn xr ac a.7 to journals, especially the following : Secret e., November 1900, i sop .46-47. j , Secret E., October 1901, N ob. 393-398.

He sent the most garbled accounts of the British doings at Maskat and the Persian Gulf and made the most scurrilous and venomous attacks on the British and the Saltan of Maskat. 558. For some time he associated himself in intrigues 'With one M. Frederick von Karnatzki, a Britisn secret e., June 1901, Nos 23 -45. subject born in London, who had been once an aeent of Messrs. Livingstone, Mnir and Oo._ at Shiraz, but expelled for embezzlement, and lived a fast and loose life with a Persian ww&amp;nn Maskat from about July 1900. M. Karnatzki was expelled by the Sultan from Masqat in February I'JOl and as the Political Agent declined to interfere, lie had to leave the place for Karachi. 559. M. Goguyer's two Influentiel allies among the Arabs at Masqat and m ' J the Gulf were Sheikh Abdulla-lnn-Ali Secret e., June 1902, N ob , e-s. Kasim of Bunder Jisseh and Mahompd Abdul Wahab of Bahrein, who acted as his agents in his mercantile transactions and advanced him loans. 660. In 1903 a dispute on their mutual claims arose between M. Goguyer and Abdulla-bin-Ali. It appears than in Secret e ., October 1903, N ob . 20-33. 190 2 certain sums were due from Abdulla-bin-Ali to M. Goguyer in connection with ^ their joint transactions in the sale of arms. Some delay having occurred in the setdement or account, M. Laronce addressed the Sultan demanding the immeai pay ment of Bs. -0,000 and shortly after a French ship of war arrived at Maskat to support the claim, which, under the pressure thus brought to bear, was pa d in fufb Ata later date, after an examination of the dete Is of the aceount, M. Laronce directed M. Goguyer to make a refund ot Es. 7,500. M.. Go'-'uver's appeal against this decision was rejected by tbo Hioh Lourt Bourbon - but despite the admitted justice of the claim,_ the f Vice- Consul subsequently informed Abdulla-bin-Ali tbat a . ct ^ n towards enforcing the decree until payment bad been obtained of tl.o mdem of l,r,00 dollars which had been demanded from the Sultan in connection with the alleged attack at Sur on a dhow carrying the French flag. 561. The Sur incident had been disposed of by the recent agreement to refer to the Hague Tribunal the whole question of the ngbt and privileges conferred by the possession of the French flag, and there appeared to tue Gov- ernment of 'India no reason why the claim of Abdulla-bm-Ah should not be setUed forthwith. It was found that the failure to adjust this claim had led to the inability of Abdullah to pay certain d( ; ht9 ^^1^0' The colm and Company, a British-protected firm of Government of India therefore expressed hopes that flues and to ment might now be able to obtain early satisfaction ot his due^,120 secure the withdrawal of M. Goguyer from Maskat (despatch to the Secretary of State, JNo. 104, dated 23rd July 1903). 562. It was reported in October that M. Goguyer had liquidated Abdulla- 8., re . B..

It was therefore agreed that no further action should be taken in the matter (Foreign Department letter Ko. 2566.E.A., dated 27th September 190o). 563. The facts connected with his proposed expulsion are as follows :— In April 1902 the Secretary of State informed the Government of India, tha^ Teiepram, dated sth April 1902— see No, 61 io ^ had been 3ScertriiDed through the French secret e., may 1902, nos 56-63.

The latter refused to co-operate and the India Office was then asked to decide what further steps should be taken, with a proposal that the Sultan should address the French Consul strongly protesting against the behaviour of Mens. Goguyer, adding threat of expulsion if he again transgressed. In October 1902 early instructions were asked for, but the Secretary of State's reply received almost immediately Pespatch No. iso -Secrot, dated 2nd October after despatch of the last communication, i902-.BeeNo.66 insert e ..

I 11 1903 the matter connected with Mons. Goguyer was thrice referred to in communications addressed to the Secretary of State, viz.:— (1) In despatch No. 97 (Secret), dated the 16th July 1903, relative to the No. 373 in Secret E., September 1903, Bos. maiiCiOUS and perverted ac- , vI 83 *, , ^ counts of events at Maskat published by Mons.

To strengthen the demand made by the Sultan, MaskaUhe India Office was again asked to press for removal. * 664. In December 1904, Major Grey again raised the question about the secret b ., february 1905, nos. 254-258. expulsion of Mr. Goguyer, in view of his TVio n 4. c t j • t , scurrilous writings and' the arms traffic The Government of India had already written to the Secretary of state S121 Despatch No. 226-Secret, dated 8tli December 190 , in connection with the trade between Jibuti and Aden Hinterland. Steps were also being taken for the repression of the scurrilous leaflets which issued from Beyrout and in which M. Goguyer was believed to be interested. It was decided to take no other action than simply send the papers about M, Goguyer 's doings to the India Office. (v) Journey to Sur and back by Mons. Billecocq, Vice-Conaul for Franco at Maska^, 565. The Erench Vice-Consul, M, Billecocq and his dragoman appear to „ , , „ „ have made in January 1905 arrangements Secret E., Mirch 1905, Nos. 62-63. » . ... . o t i j -ar* for travelling to Sur by land. Major Grey referred the matter to the Sultan, who said that he had heard nothing of the project and would write to enquire. There was no doubt that the French Vice-Consul had made preparations for the overland journey and would have slipped away quietly had he not been prevented by a seyere attack of fever. He intended now to proceed to Karachi for the benefit of hia health under advice of the Assistant Surgeon. 566. Major Grey's relations with the French Vice-Consul left nothing to be desired, but the latter lost no opportunity of slighting the Sultan, and Major Grey considered it highly advisable that he should be dissuaded from travelling in Oman until the question ol French proteges was finally settled. The scheme of visiting Sur was for the time being in abeyance and His Highness, acting on with the concurrence of Major Grey, would try to prevent it being carried into effect on M. Billecocq's return to Maskat (Major Grey's letter No. 22, dated Uth January 1905). 567. Exception was taken by the Foreign Office to Major Grey's action in moving His Highness the Sultan to refuse Secret E.,Sep lem ber 1905, No., 128 160. facilities for the French Vice-consul's journey to Sur. It was, however, explained by Major Grey that he did not move the Sultan to refuse facilities, but owing to the unsettled condition of the tribes and the increase of anti-European feeling occasioned by recent events connected with the island of Maseirah, lie only suggested that the Vice- Consul should be recommended not to journey in the direction of Sur, The French Vice -Consul on his return to Maskat proposed to pay his usual visit to Sur in May, and the effect of this visit the Political Agent feared would doubt less be to strengthen the opposition of certain members of the Sur community to the Sultan's jurisdiction and to increase the number of malcontents (Major Grey's letter No. 162, dated 3rd April 1905). 568. On 28th April 1905 Major Grey telegraphed :— ' The French Consul wishes to borrow His Highness the Sultan's steamer for bis journey to Sur. Should His Highness lend or refuse it ? If he did lend it, the French Government might perhaps represent that in their case it was a proof of acquiescence not only in the journey, but also the object for which it is taken.' Major Cos having fully endorsed Major Grey's views, the Government of India instructed the Political Agent to advise Hia Highness, in case lie was consulted, to frankly tell the French Consul that pending the Hague Tribunal's decision, he would prefer to lend the steamer neither to the French nor the English Consul in case such action might be interpreted in favour of either party (telegram dated 2nd May 1905). t69. The French Vice-Consul proceeded to Sur on the French flagship Infer net on 16th May. Secret E., AugUBt 1905, N ob 308-317. 570. At the time the Sultan was at Gwadur, and on the day of his departure the French Vice-Consul posted secret e.. september 1905, No«. 129 -150. a letter to His Highness requesting that the Nur-el-Bahr might be sent to Sur early in June to bring him and his wife back to Masqat. This request the Sultan declined to comply with. On hearing of this refusal, Major Cox arranged to despatch the Lapwing, which C973FD122 was in the harbour, to Sur, with a letter to the Vice-Consul offering to place the British gun-boat at his disposal. M. Billecocq, however, deolined the offer, and returned to Maskat with his wife in a dhow. It appears that extraordinary efforts had been made by him to compel the Sultan to lend him his steamer, and even the threat used that if she were not sent arrangements would be made for the permanent stationing of a French gun-boat at Maskat. (vi) Exercise of Jurisdiction by the Sultan over his subjects in the French employ, (a) Case of Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Kasmi of Bunder Jisseh. 671. In February 1902 Major Cox asked for instructions as to the q i u t i 0 n« v fi q attitude which the Sultan should adopt in Secret E , June 1908, Nos. 6-8. ., , p ~r^ » „ . . the event or French protection being claimed for one Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Ali Kasmi, a Maskat subject, residing at Bunder Jisseh, who was acting with M. Goguyer as Joint Agent for the new line of Russian steamers at the port of Maskat. 572. The Government of India replied in their letter No. lOlS-E. A., dated 20th May 1902 ' I am to say in reply that the Sultan's jurisdiction over bis own subjects within his own territory cannot be effected by any claim advanced by eucb subjects to French protection, even though such claim may be based on the acquisition of rights of citizenship in Fiance. The Sultan whose will is law in Maskat has distinctly declared that he will not permit his subjects to throw off their allegiance. Consequently the French have no right to interfere with the continuance of a jurisdiction, not of a nature opposed to the usage of civilieed nations, over persons whom they have chosen to invest with the status of French citizens. It is assumed that shaikh Abdulla-l in-Ali Kasmi cannot be regarded, for the purposes of article 4 of the French Treaty with Maskat, as a person actually in the service of the French.' (b) Objections to the administration of the estate of the late French Navy contractor, Habluk, by the French Vice-Consul at Maskat, 1905. 673. One Abul Hasan-bin-Abdullah known as Habluk, who had been eoret E., May 1906, Nos. 416-423. employed by the French Consulate as contractor of supplies to French men-of- war, having died in March 1905, his estate was taken over by the French Vice- Consul, M. Billecocq ; and he claimed that the deceased was a French proteg^ and wrote to the British Consul regarding the debts due to certain British subjects asserting his jurisdiction to adjudicate their claims. The status of a British protege is not acceded to the contractor for British men-of-war and Major Grey argued that no such status could be claimed for the French Navy contractor who was much less employed than the former and received no salary from the French Government: the treaty between France and Oman (articles 4 and 5) did not cover an employe of this nature. Major Grey declined therefore to discuss the claims of the British subjects concerned with the French Vice-Consul and informed him that they would be placed before His Hio-hness the Sultan in due course (Major Grey's letter No. 143, dated 21st March 1905). 574 The Government of India decided not to take any action in the matter until the termination of the arbitration proceedings or unless the rohtical Agent reported fresh developments. VII) Wreck of the French ship Amiral Gneydcn at Bas Hasek near Dhofar and visit of French and Russian ships of war to the Dhofar Coasts. 575. In May 1903 a large French liner, the Admiral Oueydon, bound from Maelcat agency administration report for 1903.04. Havre to tllC Far East with msspno-Ar*! Secret E., January 19U4.

Ibis he was successful in doing, and he could hardlv have chosen a better spot than that chanced upon, namely, the soft sandv strand under tne lee of Has Hasek near Hhofar in the Sultan's territory. The123 monsoon having by this time commenced, communication by native craft with Maskat or elsewhere was impossible owing to the heavy sea running, and a messenger sent overland never arrived, so there the unfortunate mariners had to remain until the season opened again. Tor four months the ship's company and passangers consisting of 350 men, one lady and two children were encamped on the strand along side of the smouldering ship in rough tents made of awn- in^s, etc., and provisioning themselves from the ship's stores. During that time they appear (from the account given to the press by the Commander) to have been treated with surprising humanity by the wild Gara and Mahri tribesmen who inhabit that inhospitable coast. After they had been there a short time the new^s of their shipwTeck reached the Sultan's Governor at Dhofar, and he at once joined them in person and gave them the protection oE his presence until the monsoon sea subsided, and it was possible for him to hire dhows to take the party to Maskat. In due coarse, on 12th September, he procured three dhows and the whole of the shipwrecked persons after stoiing a large quantitv of provisions in the dhows left in them for Maskat escorted by some representatives of the Wali. On the voyage thither, they were encountered by the Russian merchantman Trouver homeward bound, taken on board, and sately landed at Aden a few days later. It is interesting to note that the Admiral Guevdon was ultimatelv raised by the salvage steamer of the ^ Perim coal company and reached Perim safely at the end of December, at which time she is said to have been still smouldering, seven months after she caught tire . 575A. As there were allegations made that the wreck had been pillaged by the natives and the Sultan was uneasy Secret B., January 1904, Nos. 289-248 (No. 245). ^ ^ ma ^ er} j^S Was arranged to send H M S Sphinx to the scene of the wreck.

Imam Azzan bm Kais, whom the Arabs i,nd Sbeikbs of Eostak had elected as their chief. Sayyid Said bm Thrabim fled to Hazm Fort and solicited the aid of the Sultan of Masbat. Suleiman bin Sweilim was then directed to proceed forthwith to the Batiueb co'st to restrain the Yal Saad and other Hlnawi tribes from joining Sayyid Said 8 force. These steps resulted in the dispersal of the latter's fol owers, and the Sultan would liavo been well advised to have remained satisfied with the successlie allowed Suleiman bin Sweilim to attempt to take possession of Kostak on His TTitflinpss's behalf. This brought down the Bern lluvabeb tribes from Sliarkiyeh and the Yal Saad tribes would have joined them, but the death of one of the Arab leaders at Eostak, the notorious Sheikh Hamnd bin Said al Tahati who had taken part for 28 years in insurrection against the Sultans of Maskat gave rise to confusion among the tribes, and saved the Sultan from a Ss a 1 along the Batineh coast. Rostak had, however, to be given up by the SnWs forces and leave Snyid Saud in its possession. Sayid Saud was mnr^pred on 13tb March 1^99 and succeeded by his brother. Sayid Hamud r5 Sd bin Ibrabim remained in possession of the fort of Ham.

In August 1903, while the Sultan was at Sur endeavouring to settle Secret b., Decomber 1903, Nos. 4-i7. the differences between the two factions Administration Report for 1903-04. inbabiting that town, he learnt of the migration from Sharkiyeh with a strong following of the Aysa bin Saleh and his two brothers, sons of the late Saleh bin Saleh, the leader of the insurrection of 1896, with a view to occupy the forts of Hazm and Rostak. The former was in the same independent possession of Said bin Ibrahim-bin-Kais, and the latter in that of Hamud-bin-Az an, representatives of two rival branches of the same family as we have seen above. Both were outwardly on good terms with the Sultan, but practically independent of him, but at the same time at feud with one another. 580. Aysa bin Saleh in invading the Batineh coast gave out that he wished to call the tribes together to select an Imam, and destroy the authority of Sheikh Faisal. He held out the bait of Imamsbip to Said bin Ibrahim and ultimately won him to his side. 581. Although His Highness Sayyid Faisal habitually subsidises the local tribesmen for holding the passes leading from the Sharkiyeh country into the hinterland of Maskat, nevertheless by the time a small force under Wali Suleiman-bin-Suweilin and Sayyid Taimoor had been landed at Seeb with orders to push on and hold the road leading from the Semail valley and Rostak, news was received that the intruders had been treacherously allowed by the* guards to debouch unmolested through the main pass of Akk into the Wadi Semail, and before Wali Suleiman's party could reach Finjeh, where they hoped to intercept them, Aysa and his followers had passed onwards in front of them towards Rostak. Un receiving this news His Highess at. once left Maskat in the Nur-ul&lt; Bahr for the port of Mesnaa, the nearest point on the coast to Rostak, and, having arrived there forthwith put the loyalty of his brother-in-law to the test by sending a special messenger to him inviting him to a conference on the Nur-ul-Bahr. As was expected, Said-bin-Ibrahim excused himself on the plea of indisposition, and proceeded to join Aysa-bin- Saleh, who was by this time encamped outside the Fort of Rostak. 582. The Sultan's next move was to depute Wali Suleiman with 150 men to strengthen and hold the Fort of Awabi, from which point, in the event of hostilities breaking out, Aysa's line of retreat could be menaced. Sayvid Taimur was simultaneously posted in the Fort of Mesnaa with an increased garrison, and, encamped outside, were a number of professedly friendiv Sheikhs who, with numerous followings, had gathered round the Sultan, and were contentedly awaiting developments and being maintained at His High- ness's expense. During this time. His Majesty's ship Sphinx made frequent trips to various points on the Batineh coast, to enable the Political Agent, who was sometimes on board to remain in close touch with the Snltan, and, at the same time, to safeguard with her presence on the coast, the lives and property of British Indian subjects residing there. Though most of the latter send their valuables into Maskat for safety, none of them were sufficiently alarmed to follow themselves, and, fortunately, matters never became serious enough to call for the issue of any general orders for their exodus. In fact, both Aysa-bin-Saleh and Said-bin Ibrahim addressed courteous letters to the Political Agent expressing friendly sentiments and their intention to use their best endeavours to see that no harm fell to British subjects or property. There was no change in the position of affairs for some time, during which the two confederates were engaged in negotiations with the object of obtainino- peace able possession of Rostak fort from the party of Beni Ruwalieh tribesmen who garrisoned it. Ostensibly these men garrisoned the fort on behalf of Hamud- bin-Azzan, but wlieieas the latter had at once evacuated his quarters there and thrown in his lot with Aysa and Said, the Beni Ruwaheh had other ideas and for a long time refused altogether to admit the intruders. In the end' however, probably on the re-eipt of a sufficiently remunerative bribe thev agreed to hand over possession of the fort to Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim. On gaining their object so fai, both Aysa and Said wrote letters to the Sultan in patron ising terms, informing him of their success as if it were a matter of which heTi 127 would be very pleased to hear, and both went on naively to inform him by clear insinuation, if not in so many words, that Said had been chosen u Imam,' or as they put it, ' invested with the affairs of Muslimeen.' 583. It is easy to imagine that the ambition of Aysa and S lid must have clashed somewhat at this juncture, but Aysa must soon have realized that he himself, whatever his religious qualifications might be, was not of sufficiently aristocratic descent to gain the approval of the majority, and, that next to his own candidature the selection of a weak candidate like Said-bin-Ibrahim, who would be a puj3pet in his hands, would be the best alternative. Nevertheless, had Ay^a himself been put forward, there can be no doubt that he would have received a good deal of active support from his own part of the country, and it was well known, moreover, that, had any general call to arms resulted, Aysa's reputation for devotion to the faith was such that several influential Sheikhs had openly given out about this time that though they would not support him against the Sultan, they would refuse to take up arms against him. j?rom the moment however that it became apparent that Said-bin-Ibrahim was the best candidate that could be got to come forward, it was a foregone conclusion that the movement would be abortive for the latter has neither the moral nor religious reputation to win general support from the people of Oman, whose formally expressed approval is a sine qua non of the confirmation of any candi date as ' Imam.' £84. While the above negotiations were in progress at Rostak, Aysa's two brothers busied themselves elsewhere, and with a small following of black legs made raid in several direction^ including the outskirts of JBarka, where they attacked the summer quarters of the Saltan's stable manager, killed his son, wounded two of his women kind, and carried off two servants and some horses. Einding that the latter were the Saltan's property, Aysa had them sent back with a condescending letter from him to flis Highness. 585. The forts of Hazm and Uostak being now in the hands of his ally Said and the suggestion of the latter as Imam having met with little or no response, it was expected that Aysa and his attendant tribesmen would now return to their country, but this they showed no signs of doing probably owing to the fact that prolonged drought had made the conditions of life difficult in their own villages, and that in their present quarters they were living free, either at the expense of Seyyid-bin-Ibraium or the people of Rostak. 586. Nevertheless, by the first week in October the Sultan, who had for nearly two months been incurring very heavy expenses for the maintenance of a large force of friendlies on the Batineh coast and its outposts, now f&lt;4t able to draw in his horns, and to limit his precautions to the retention of streng thened garrisons at the post most liable to attack. His Highness himself now returned to Maskat leaving his two elder sons, Taimur and Nadir, to represent him on the coast. 587. From this time, although as long as Aysa and Seyyid remained together there could not be an entire absence of anxiety or sense of security, matters generally quieted down and trading operations which had for long time past been paralysed were once more resumed. It was not till the month of February that Aysa-bin-Seleh returned to his country, but for the last four or five months previous he had ceased to be a sourse of anxiety. 588. In October 1904, a party of Al-Wahibeh, a tribe of Hinawi Bedouins, while on a plundering expedition, attacked Secret E . March 1905, No.. 64-67. a ^ the ^ borders of J aa | an and Shark, some 80 miles from the coast and defeated a number of the Beni-bu-Ali (a tribe of the Gaffiri section) who came out to oppose them. The former lost 10 killed and wounded, and the latter 16. Among the killed was a son of the Beni-bu-Ali Chief Abdullah bin Salim. The Sultan was afraid that Abdullah bin Salim might wage war on a somewhat larger scale than usual in revenge for his son's death. C973FD12S CHAPTEE XXIV. Becent British Eelatioas with tho Sultan. (i) Sayyid Taimur, the Sultan's eldest son : His proposed tour in India and education- 589. Sayyid Taimur is the eldest son of the Sultan by his senior wife, external a.. april 1902, nos 37-38. Alaiyeh, daughter of Sayyid Thoweni, now (in 1905) 19 years old. He has been employed by his father in important military expeditions, and in August 1901 on his return from a tour in the interior, he was received on his way by sea from Matrah by a salute of 13 guns, and the day after his landing paid a visit to the Political Agent alone. This was the first time he was paid any public compliments and the incident was regarded as officially marking his entry into public life. 590. In Major Cox's opinion he has the makings of a reasonably capable and moderate man. The Political Agent suggested the desirability of Sayyid Taimur being placed under an English tutor and taken in a tour in India to see something of its grandeur and methods of Government (Captain Cox to Colonel Kemball, No. 345, dated 4th September 1901). 591. The Government of India approved of the idea of showing Sayyid Taimur through India, and desired Captain Cox to inform the Sultan that they yvere prepared to attach an officer to aid him in the tour. Such a tour mi»ht inspire him with a desire to be educated at one of the Chiefs' Colleges in India, but that was a possibility which was not to be considered at the time (Foreign Department letter No. Ib02-A., dated 21st October 1901). (ii) Desire of the Sultan ofMaskat to make a present to the King-Emperor on the occasion of the Coronation ; question deferred until the Delhi Jurbar, 1902. 592. The Sultan Sayyid Paisal was anxious, as his grandfather Sayyid Internal A., May 1902 Nos. 24-28. Said had done, to send presents to the King-Emperor on the occasion of the coronation as an expression of his cordial sentiments to His Majesty. He pro posed first to send a pair of choice Arab horses, but there is practically no breeding of ' high caste ' horses in the Sultan's dominions. His Highness therefore decided that the present should take the form of a selection of gold or gold mounted articles of local workmanship and characteristic Oman design to the value of about £500, to which he wished to add : 2 specimens of the Beatrix Antelope (rare in Europe). 2 specimens of the wild goat of Oman (of which no living specimen bad left the shores of Oman). 593. The Government of India in view of the recent orders of His Majesty 's Government on the subject of presents would not recommend acceptance of the presents, were it not that there might be some political advantage in a gift at tne time and that its acceptance might render it easier for us to help the Sultan in respect of the Yacht later on (Viceroy's telegram to the Secretary of State dated 14tb April 1902). 594 The Foreign Office suggested postponement of consideration until some future dale, perhaps that oi the Indian celebration, since similar proposals were being declined in London (Secretary of State's dated 25tb April 1902). 595. Major Cox, then in a demi-official letter dated 31st May 190?, inform- Internal A., July 1902, &gt;os. 219-220, ^ ^ that as he had told the*Sultan that his presents would be acceptable, His High ness had made them to order and that they were ready for despatch. He pointed out that the despatch of the animals could be got out of on score of the proxi mity of the monsoon, but that as to the gold articles the Sultan would be hurt at being told that the question of acceptance would be considered later. ^ 59 '. The Secretary of State was then addressed by telegram on 12th June 1902 :— ' ^ ox wa!3 unable owing to absence to communicate message to Sultan until too late to Stop manufacture of gold presents, which are now ready. May they be despatched ? Horeeff129 («i&lt;? animals ?) can wait till later date. Sulian as independent eovereign stands in different position from Indian Chiefs and. I recommend acceptance of his girt. 597. The Secretary of State replied on 17 th June : ' Foreign Office objection is one of snbstance^ asits acceptance necessitates return presents and this would swell considerably Coronation expenses. As it is not proposed to send horses, now, I suggest that tho Sultan be advised to suspend present till he can send it full^ Major Cox was then informed (telegram, dated 2Brd June) that as it would be too late to send the articles in time for the June Coronation he should advise the Sultan to present the articles at the Delhi Coronation Darhar. (iii) * The Sultan invited to the Delhi Darbar: Deputation of his son Sayyid Taimur: the latter's tour in India : Barbar Day at Maskat. 598. The Sultan was cordially invited hy the Government of India to attend the Delhi Darbar as the guest of Government, or to send a deputation m the event of his own inability to avail himself of the invitation, Uniortunately His Highness did not feel able to absent himself from Maskat for the period which his presence at Delhi in person would have necessitated, and therefore sent his eldest son Sayyid Taimur to represent him, attended by Sayyid Yusui Zowawi, a close friend and adviser of the Sultan, and Sayyid Mahomed bin Ahmad bin Nasir, Governor of Matrah. The Political Agent accompanied the deputation as Political Officer. 699. On arrival at Karachi Sayyid Taimur was received with his father's salute of 21 guns and was escorted onshore by the Port Officer. He was accorded similar honors on arrival at and departure from Delhi, ana was in ail matters treated as representing His Highness the Sultan. 600. In spite of the severe cold the party kept good health and were able to attend all the preordained functions and to enter heartily into other pleasures during the progress o£ festivities, which they thoroughly appreciated and enioyed. Saywl Taimur and his companions had an interview with His Excellency the Viceroy, taking with them a set of hanosome gold chnsed articles of local pattern and workmanship which the Sultan had made for His Majesty the Kin' and which His Excellency the Viceroy had kindly ^undertaken to have forwarded to their destination. During the interview Sayyid laimnr delivered me ssages of congratulation and friendship from his father, and Hs Excellenov expressed his pleasure at being able to honor the occasion by the mesentation to His Highness the Sultan of 2 guns as an armament tor the steamer which he had lately purchased, through the good offices 01 the Govern- ment of India, for his own use. 601. Before the Darbar broke up the Government of India were pleased to decorate Sayyid Taimur with the gold Delhi Darbar Coronation Medal. 602 After' leaving Delhi on 12th January Sayyid Taimur and party proceeded direct to Bombay, where a fortnight was spent while comnmnicatio^ passed with His Highness the Sultan regarding a proposed tour to Agra, Au^arh and Calcutta In the meanwhile, at his father's wish fea yy l( | Tairaur visited h^sgrand uncle, Sayyid Abdul Aziz at , .^oo 13 ®' a ^ d 2g t ^ Z j a ^aiT ouentlv ionrneved to Bombay to return his nephew s visit. On 2fath January tlm n rtv left for Asra where three days were spent seeing the sights of the neighbourhood. From Agra a short excursion was made to Ahgarh. Sayyid Ta mur hav n.' been invited by the Principal and Council to pay a visit to theTavyid Ahmed Mahomedan Anglo-Oriental College. A long mormng It spe ^t there and the party were received with much kmdness and dist.n. tinn bv the College authorities, and appeared to be greatiy interested ana imoressed bv what they said ; in the afternoon a start was made for Calcutta, where another week was spent and various ptowa o^rest ^ m l of which it was time to think of returning to Maskat, whiUi was icacnett fafelv on 18th February. It is certain that the whole party thoroughly enjoye thair tour especially Sayyid Taimur, who displayed much intelligence and ^ Tense under' the novel surroundings, and there can be no doubt that besides the pleasure whic h he derived from what be saw boA at Mhi_anu is takeuToua Cbe Maskar/g.ncy Admiuistrat^n Eeport tor ISiO^Od.130 afterwards his experiences have opened his mind considerably and will leave upon him a lasting impression for good. 603. On his safe return His Highness the Sultan fired a salute of 21 guns as a mark of his acknowledgments to Government for their entertainment of his deputation and this was followed by a salute of 13 guns in honour of Sayyid Taimur. 604. At Maskat the Darhar Day was appropriately celebrated. A salute of 101 guns was fired and the Union Jack flown from the Sultan s 8 saluting battery from sunrise to sunset and His Highness with bis usual suit called officially at the British Consulate to offer his congratulations, as did the repre sentatives of Poreign Powers. ^ The members of the British Indian communi ties closed and illuminated their shops in honour of the occasion and deputations of the several persuasions called at the Consulate to express their congratula tions and loyalty to the Crown, A telegram was at the same time sent by them to the Government of India for favour of transmission to His Majesty the King conveying similar expressions of congratulation and loyalty. (iv) Visit of His Excellency the Viceroy to Maskat, 18th-19th November 1903. 605. One of the most memorable events in the history of Maskat, was the Secret E., February 1904, Nos. 83-127. Visit paid by Lord CurZOU to the place in November 1903. Maskat has been linked to the British Government mainly by political connection of over a century, demonstrated by a series of treaties, no fewer than nine and support given by us to its Sultan on several critical occasions, and by commercial inter course, which has been mainly Indian and in Indian hands. *It is not surprising therefore the Viceroy should have desired to visit a place in which India has an abiding interest. 606. For a description of the visit to Maskat we shall extract the following paragraph from the Government of India's despatch No. 196, dated 17th December 1903:— Early on the morning o£ 18th November we arrived at Maskat, and stayed there tmtil secret E„ Proceedings February 1904, Ncs. 33— following evening. During this time ofHcwl 127. visits were exchanged with the Sultan, I received ■^i an address from the Indian traders in Maskat territory, and I held a Darbar on board the 'Argonaut' following by the investiture of the Sultan with the G. C. I E. Copies of my speeches to the British Indian subjects and at the Darbar are included among the enclosures to this letter. It was not necessary to say in them anything beyond what has been said before ; although the circumstances in which the statements and assurances were now repeated, no doubt invested them with a new and special significance. His Highness the Sultan on all these ooeasions conducted himself with simplicity and dignity, bis demeanour was that of a loyal feudatorv of the British Crown rather than of an independent sovereign, and it is clear that he trusts implicitly to the British power for support and protection. He did not plead for any further engagements, nor did be seek to extract any fresh pledge. The situation and its surroundings were evi- dently sufficient in his eyes to confirm him in reliance upon our friendship, and in an atti tude of deference to our wishes, which is not onlv of good omen for the future, but which reflects the greatest credit upon Major Cox, the Political Agent whom I appointed to Maskat in 1899, and who in little more than four years has converted the ruler trom feelings of sus picion, if not of direct hostility, to those of confidence and regard. On the other hand, in proportion as the desire of the Sultan to range himself, so to speak, alongside of the Indian Princes in their relations to the Eritish Crown was made manifest, so did the incongruity of his international posit'on become mere apparent while the contradition between the actual etaw of affairs with a ruler, a people, and a trade almost entirely dependent upon ourselves and the theoretical status, under which France, represented only by a Consul, with no subieets and next to no trade, enjoys a treaty equality with Great Britain was B uch as to emphasize the desirability of terminating with as little delay as possible a situatioa so anomalous TVi i™? t almo ' Bt J be TT said T so grotesque. On the concluding afternoon of my sta V at Maskat I invited His Highness the Sultan to a private interview at which I asked him to say anythmg that was m tus mind. Before conferring upon him the insignia of G.C LE., by order of His Majesty the Kmg Emperor, on the morning of the same day, I had stipulated that His Highness should place himself entirely in the hands of the Government of India and shauld act upon their advice in respect of his desire to abdicate, previously reported by me to you. The subject accordingly was not mentioned during the private conversation. The Sultan raised two small points about which it is unnecessary for me to trouble yon in this letter, and I spoke to biin about the management of his Customs131 which is not altogether satisfactory. He expreB,ed anxiety to know W heo fla| que ^hon between ^ in3e ^ ^ y'jgi^^an 'that that^Court had a fMiod rteal'of work on its hands retnrn no \ he Sultan evidently feels keeolv on the matter, as he very Mastmably^nay^ and it is one in which I would press upon His Majesty's Gov—t the desirability of accelerating progress as much as possible. 607 In the Viceroy's reply to the address of welcome presented at Maskat i«fh 4ovpmber 190o, by a deputation of Hindu, Mahommedan. Parsi and other protected British subjects settled in the towns of Maskat and Matrah, we may note the following passage • t 0 f v[rac address vou have spoken of the disturbances that some times ■ T the SerL and whieh occasionally travel down to the coast ports and aftect the sprmgup in the mteno and ^ Goyemment have lleve r embroded .ecurlty of Re places in w y rs to b6 a hered it aIy legacy in Oman.

There were in 1903 rumours that Sayyid Faisal was anxious to abdi cate m favour of his son Taimur. When therefore Lord Curzon proposed to invest the Sultan with the insignia of G. C. 1. E., His Highness was given to understand that he (Lord Curzon) expected that His Highness would in this matter of his proposed abdication place himself entirely in the hands of His Aiajesty s Goyernment and under no circumstances take any further sten in that direction except under their advice and with their concurrence. The pultan explained that until he received the acquiescence and assurance of support in the matter ot the succession of his son, he certainly would take no steps to carry out his idea of abdication. A ahomedTurkihad recently shown himself rather iealous of the attention bestowed upon the Sultan's son Taimur. It was Taimur that hPlrf n h Hl3 Hl S bn f 8 afc the ^ethi Darhar, and at the Darbar held on hoard the the Maskatharhour on the 19th of NoTember Lord Curzon m akuowledging the Sultan's welcome and expression of 'ntil h^. tw at . ta ^. m f Qt t0 Gr eat Britain, made the natural observation that fiJ v/ 1113 1 | 1 g h ! leS8 . w ould give his son Sayyid Taimur a training which would fit him for following m his father's footsteps.

He s. complaint was that his claims were entirely ignored and that Sayyid Qaimur was put forward as heir to the Sultan.

Currency, CuBtoms and Duties: Loans to the Sultan, 1903-04. (i) Administration of the Sultan's Customs. 614. The Sultan took over in 1900 the customs administration himself, As to previout history see parat, 306—3io. and appointed two Mahomedans who had Secret E, Jannarj 1901, Nos. 111-112. experience of customs management at Bombay to supervise the collection of the revenue. Net revenue to the Sultan after working customs direct for one year was just under $ 190,000. The highest figure previously derived from sale of customs was $ 170,000, The Sultan was disinclined to employ a British official, partly because at the time there was talk about the Russians taking over Bandar Abbas customs and the Erench reports were echoed in Arabic papers that Maskat customs and with them the State were about to come under British domination, and partly from fear of abolition of personal and tribal indulgences. 615. In a question raised about the liability of importers to pay customs on goods transhipped at Maskat, the Sultan External A., Janw, 1901, Ho S . 4,16-418. contend ed in their favour. The GoTern- ment of India considered that the goods consigned from abroad to the agents at Maskat, with discretion to dispose of them locally or to find another market in neighbourhood, must be held to have reached their ' destination ' by deli very to agents at Maskat. This was the strictly legal view. The Government of India thought however there should be no rule requiring that goods for transhipment or re-exportation from Maskat should be so declared in the mani fest of a vessel or in bill of lading. If agents followed procedure laid down in 6 (1) of the treaty of 1891 real intent thereof would be secured. Destination of goods, for practical purposes, was destination stated by agents. If the Sultan's contention were admitted the trade of the port would decline (letter No. 2362-Ext. A, dated 24ith December 1900). 616. The Sultan accepted the Government of India's view and explained that the reason of his original objection was absence of a bonded warehouse and probable dishonesty of merchants, who were consequently allowed to keep the goods free of duty on their own premises pending re-exportation (Captain Cox's letter dated 5th February 1901. External A, April 1901, Nos. 11-12). 617. In order to facilitate the collection of dues at Sur, where the inhabit- . „ . _ , ants have alwavs been very difficult to Maskat Administration Keport for 19C1-0S. f i vi • a - -x ttx deal with in this connection, it was His Highness's first idea to build a wall on the land side, so as to restrict all import and export caravan traffic to the use of certain gates where the customs guards would be stationed On going into the matter on the spot, however, he realized that owing to the difficulty of obtaining materials and labour at Sur itself, the building of a wall of effective length would take a year or more to complete, and he therefore chose the more economical and speedy alternative of creating a line of blockhouses on the hills between Sur-el-Bilad and the port of Sur, commanding the caravan routes from the interior. These were completed during his sojourn at Sur in November 1901. 618. The new system of customs administration was extended in 1902-03 also to G wadur. The revenue in Oman Muskat AdanmBtration Report for 1902-03. cu&amp;tom3 i n 1902-03 touched the highest figures that had yet been reached, there being an increase of one million dollars in the value of the trade as compared with past year. 619. The wharf, which had been quite inadequate for the accommodation required, was enlarged by taking in more of the foreshore and roofed sheds were moreover erected on it for better protection of merchandise from the elements. At the same time suitable offices and warehouses were erected. 620. The new steamer* Nuvul-Bahr purchased by the Sultan would, it was hoped, facilitate the customs administrati on considerably. bee paragraph 626 post.135 ind No, 328 623. The Government of India submit ted the following proposals to the Secretary of State in their telegram dated IGtli October 1904 :— Id view of the opinion expressed in Lord George Hamilton's telegram, dated tbe IHth February 189S, and iu order to avoid direct British control of the Maskac customs, it is pro posed that the Imperial Bank of Persia should be induced to open a branch at Maskat, and fixed monthly advances on the security of the customs might then be made on a Government guarantee, on the condition that the cu.-toms revenue will be collocted by officers approved by the British Government, and that the money so collected will be paid into the Bank. Any balance due either way could be paid on settlement of account at; the close of the year. This proposal is considered most desirable by the local Polilical Officer, and there is pressing need for the introduction of Customs reform. We trust that you will, if the proposed action is approved, kindly obtain the views of the Directors of the Bank in London ; and if they are aoreeable, His Highness the Sultan will be approached, and his decision in the matter reported to you. Should the Sultan prove obstructive to those proposals it is intended to secure, as an alternative, his agreement to the Bank forming out the customs and to financing His Highnes?. As apart from the customs question, it is considered that an Agency of the Bank would prove beneficial to Indian traders at Maskat, tho Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has been instructed to consult the nearest Agent of the Bank on the gentral proposal to establish an Agency there. 624. On 13tli February 1905 the Government of India telegraphed to the Secretary of State that Captain Grey Secret e ., M.rch 1905, No.. 903-915. reported tbat consequent on a lull in the demand for arms at Koweit, the Sultan feared a temporary decrease of some 4,000 dollars a month on the customs revenue, tbat he was greatly dissatisfied with the customs administrsition, and owing to disputes could not get from them money even to despatch his steamer to Zanzibar.

It was suggested that, if His Ma jesty's Government sanctioned the pro posals, 10,000 dollars might be paid at once on account and 10,000 dollars on the day when the new head took over charge; the amount being recovered later. Pending the settlement of the above question that of opening a branch of the National Bank of India at Maskat was deferred. 625.

We have dealt in chapters VII and XIX (vi)* with the loans given to the Sultan of Maskat and their repayment up to the year 1902.

The purchase and the necessary alterations cost altogether Rs. 1,61,966 -5-2, for which an advance was made by the Government of India, recoverable by monthly instal ments of Rs. 3,000 a month from the Sultan's subsidy of Ks. 7,200 a month (No. 1991-E., dated 29th September 1902, and 802-E.

The Government of India sanctioned the advance. In recommending the grant of the loan, Major Cox had suggested that the opportunity might be taken to address the Sultan upon the manner in which His Bighness's finances are conducted. Colonel Kemball was consulted on this proposal, and on the 12th Sep tember reported that the only suggestions which Major Cox could make were (i) that a British Customs official might be deputed to Gwadur to examine certain difficulties which had arisen in connection with the customs at that port, and (ii) that a punchayet from the local mercantile community should be appointed for the purpose of periodically auditing the Maskat Customs accounts in the interests of the Sultan himself. Colonel Kemball asked that the consideration of these proposals might be postponed until he had an opportunity of meeting Major Cox and discussing the question with him. As to the proposed lease of the Gwadur customs, see Mekran Frecis, chapter XIII, paragraphs 286—289. On the 4jth October, Major Cox reported that, on the 29th September the money had been paid to the Sultan, who had been induced to agree to the deputation of a Government Customs official to Gwadur to examine the situation, and to devise a settlement acceptable alike to His Highness and to the British merchants should Government desire such a course in the event of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and Major Cox being unable to arrange the matter without troubling Government. The loan was, however, sanctioned without the conditions proposed. It was to be without interest and repayable in monthly instal ments of Rs. 1,000 from the Maskat subsidy (Finance Depart ment memo. No. 5786-A., dated 21st September 1903). Attention should be drawn here to the fact that about this time there was &gt; ti j x, an offer made by Mahomed No - m Abdul AVabab of Bahrein, a friend M. Goguyer, to the Sultan, which was nearly accepted (Major Cox's letter to Colonel Kemball, No. 351, dated 2l8t July 1903). • Paragrapln 109-114, aud 392-39U.137 (3) ll.m W «• H. —J%L M0 8U;' Secret E., February 1905, Nos. 309-339, No. 320. to tlie Urgency of the request and tbe desirability of promoting 3 good relations while the new commerpial treaty and the management of the customs were beinsr nogotiated.

Until this had been considered, no pro mise of pecuniary aid should, of course, be made to His Highness. 631. Jn a letter, dated 6th November, Major Grey wrote that he had reminded the Sultan of his undertaking to raise loans from the British Government only, and that His Highness had agreed to observe his encase ment more closely in future. Subsequently in a demi-official letter of the 0 21st November Major Grey suggested that, as the French appeared agreeable to an mterdiction of the arms trade, the cessation of the traffic might be used to seouie to consent of the Sultan to the reform of the Customs.

The dollar which prior to the closing of the mints had been worth 136—1^0 Indian pice (Us. 2-2 to Us. 2-3) gradu ally declined in value, and on 20th March 1894! fetched only 108 pice. This fall was also partly caused by the export of Government of India rupees and pice to India, 689. The country having been thus denuded of Indian rupees, as well as Indian pice, which were largely in circulation among the poor classes, and the dollar having fallen in value, there was considerable distress m the coun- try. 640. The proposals made to meet the difficulties were:— (а) to coin copper pice in Maskat fixing their exchange value at 136- 140 for a dollar, (б) to obtain a consignment of Zanzibar copper coins, (c) to prohibit exportation of Indian silver coin from Maskat, {d) to gradually substitute the Indian silver currency and drive away the Austrian dollars, to coin in India a rupee for circulation in countries like Oman, Aden etc., where the Austrian dollar has been adopted and in the Straits Settlements and China, where the Mexican dollar has been adopted. 641 Captain Saddler, Political Agent, Maskat, was strongly in favour of the last Nothing was done at the time except to relieve temporarily the distress hv importing a consignment of Zanzibar p ^e and Austrian dollarg (4.5,000), and by starting coining of copper coins at Maskat of the same size as our pice, but of a less value. (512 Eecently on account of the rapid fall in the value of silver and no biJ.recently on ^ ^ o£ e5;chang0 having been yet External a ., April 19 )4, Nos. 78-80. sanctioned between the dollar and Indian *unee there have been constant fluctuations in the exchange, resulting m uncer- Sy la trade dealings, speculation, distress among the tnbes and other evils of [C973FD]a currency decreasing in yalue by sudden changes. The Sultan has been very anxious to remedy tho evil, and has dicussed the question several times with Major Cox, who proposed to him to introduce the Indian currency. Th® question was referred in Septembor 1903 by Major Cox to Government through Colonel Kemball (Major Cox's No. 193, dated 9th October 1903). 643. The views of the Government of India were expressed in their letter No. 733-E.A., dated 4th March 1904, which should be quoted in full to understand the bearings of the delicate question:— I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 190, dated the 9th October 1903, regarding the currency of Maskat. 2. In reply I am to say that the Government of India are disposed to think that the introduction of an Indian rupee currency in the territories of the Sultan of Maskat might stimulate trade with India and he advantageous from a political point of view, but the ques tion is, a8 you remark, not unattended with difficulty, and caution is required in handling it, particularly as possible objection on the part of others may have to be borne in mind. The best plan will be for you to oouault the Sultan privately as to his wishes in the matter. If he appears to be anxioaa to reform hie currency, the Political Agent might place th© following considerations before him. 3. The quickest and most effective method of substituting the rupee for the dollar would be for the Sultan to import rupees and give them out freely in exchange for dollars for a named period, and to notify that after the expiry of that period the rupee will be the sole legal tender silver coin in his territories. The dollars which would accumulate in the Sultan's treasury during the exchange operations should be melted down and sold for rupees, 4. If the Saltan should decide to follow the above method, the Government of India might be prepared to assist him with a small loan on easy terms to finance the operation, such loan to be repayable from the proceeds of the sale of the dollars melted down. It is probable, however, that there would be some loss on the operation, because, unless the Maria Theresa dollar has no token value and passes current only at the value of the metal contained in it, the silver obtained from melting down dollars cauld not be sold for as many rupees as it would be necessary to give out in exchange for them. The extent of the loss would depend on the divergence between the current and the bullion value of the dollar. 5. Should the Sultan not be in a position to risk the loss above indicated, it would b&amp; well not to hold out to him hopes of pecuniary assistance from the Government of India, and you might in that case suggest to him the adoption of the following scheme, which, though a slower aud less certain process, would probably be succeseful in certain circumstanoes. The Sultan should announce that after a certain date all payments due to or by his Government in excess of ten dollars will be made in rupee». When this regulation bad been in force for s year, the limit for dollar payments might be reduced to five rupees, and by further progres sive steps dollars might be excluded altogether from transactions with the Government. The result would he speedily to oust the currency of the dollar from all important commercial transactions, whilst leaving it temporarily free for petty transactions, and gradually to narrow its useful circulation until the coin disappeared altogether. b. The success of the measure described in the last preceding paragraph would depend mainly on the facility with which rupees will flow to Maskat in response to the new demand. This is a question on which it is impossible to pronounce without knowledge of the local trade conditions ; but it appears to the Government of India that, since the Sultan's main source of revenue is his customs duties, it should be possible to secure large payments in rupest without much difficulty. Moreover, the rupees subsidy paid to him by the Government of India will provide him with a stock of rupees to meet claims due by his Government. 7. The enforcement of rupee payments in the interior of Oman will probably present moio difficulty, but on this point also a knowledge of the habits and circumstances of the people is necessary before a final conclusion can be formed. It would also be well to ascet-fein, if possible, how such a change of the currency medium would be viewed not only by the people of Oman, but also by the Arabs of more distant tracts who have trade relations with Maskat. 8. The Government of India have not sufficient knowledge of the local conditions to predict success with certainty, but they think that the plan sketched above is worth a tfial unless the Political Agent considers that it would not be workable. If he apprehends serious difficulty in enforcing the payment in rupees of debts of ten dollars, the iaitial limit might be fixed at twenty dollars, and subsequently reduced to ten. 9. The subsidiary copper coinage of Maskat should be dealt with on similar lines but m this case it would be necessary to follow the former of the two courses described above. The Sultan should import copper coins of the Government of India and give them out in ex change for the local ooins, which latter should be melted down as they accumulate and sold as copper.141 10. If the Sultan adopts the Ifldiao coinage tie should finally close his own Mint, and this should be a condition of any asiistance which may be oiiered to him on behaxf of the Government of India. You will, of course, understand that before any detinite iirrangemfint is made with the Suitan, the matter with your opinion must ba fully reported ior the ordei* of (rovernment. 64.-1.

He also asked Government to take over quarantine arrangements. The Agency Surgeon was prepared to do so if he was given two extra Hospital Assistants. The required Hospital Assistants were arranged for despatch to Maskat. The Sultan however professed his inability to pay for the Hospital Assistants. The Govern- ment of India ordered the Hospital Assistants to remain at Maskat at Govern ment expense. The Sultan on advice of Prench Consul refused Agency Surgeon's draft quarantine regulations and abolished quarantine at Maskat altogether. The Hospital Assistants were then ordered to return to India (telegram dated 2nd September 1899), 647. In 1900 plague broke out in a Matrah suburb. The disease Externmi a., July 1900, Nos. 89-48. was still confined to the Khoja i ort. The Bultan tried to get medical staff from Bombay, but failed. He could pay Bs. 300 per mensem for men from India, but Exterr.i a., October 1900, Ncs. si-ss, he wished that they should be under his orders. The Sultan s own men arrived and he then withdrew his request. Plague mortality was slight and Maskat was declared free on 30th May. The Sultan was afterwards disposed to give the Agency Surgeon Th% Smith Rs. 150 per mensem to superintend quarantine arrange ments and attend to ssrious cases in the Sultan's own household. The arrange ment was sanctioned by the Government of India (telegram dated 19th Septem ber 1900). 'Ihe Agency Surgeon was directed besides to give professional help and advice to Saltan in all sanitary and medical questions, besides attending to all cases requiring his aid in the Sultan's household (letter No. 1886-E. A., dated 9th September 1900). The arrangment came into force from 1st October. 648.

Total attacks in Maskat and Matrah were about 1,339 ; of which 449 in Maskat resulting in 274 deaths sn Maskat and 452 in Matrah. The chief Arab remedy for this as for other maladies was actual cautery. The epidemic spread over the whole interior: 470 persons out of 1,000 died at Surur, nearly 1,000 out of 5,000 at Semail and 450 or 15 per cent, at ttakhl. Totai deaths in Oman were about 12,331. This epidemic was preceded bv one of small-pox carrying off 6,000. The epidemic in Maskat was at its height at the beginning of November and ceased at end of January 1900. At Matrah it reached its height at the middle of October. There was a recrudescence at the end of November, continued in December and finally declined in the middle of January 1900. Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar's report dated 1st April 1900 shows that small-pox has been always prevalent, but no severe epidemic occurred m Oman for more than 30 years. All Oman subjects were against preventive measures, especially trading classes, during the date season. (ii) Enforcement of the Sultan of Maskat's Quarantine Regulations against British subjects and British protected persons, 1903. 649.

The reason of these instructions was explained in the despatch of the Secretary of State fso. 17, dated 26th June 1903, which is quoted below143 In connection with the question which has recently arisen regarding the arrest of certam in connecuuu va 4 persons at Maskat. who claimed French protection, uilui op a charge o£ havmg broken the Maskat quaran- qmarantine regulations in the case of tuhjeds. ^i n e regulations, my attention has been drawn 0 the question how a British subject would be dealt with who committed a similar offence. 2. I am advised that it is very doubtful whether a breach of quarantine regulations is a crime or offence with in the meaning of Article 18 of the Maskat Order m ounci o the 4th November 1867. Having regard to other articles the s ™« 0rder ' J to Article 19 and 22, a distinction appears to be maintained between acts umveisaily re eogriised as criaies and acts w hieh for special purposes and by some spec.al rule are made offences. 3 I desire, therefore, that His Majesty's Consul should be instructed to promulgate as hooti as possible under the powers granted to him by Article 1 of the Order Counci, a regulation which should make the offence of breaking quarantine at Maskat by British subjeots and British protected persons justifiable in the Consular Court. 4 The opportunity might be taken to consider whether there are any other points con noted witHae municipal law at Maskat in respect of which it would be conducive to the maintenance of the Sultan's authority as an independent ruler that regulations should t&gt;e issued under the Order in Council. 651. The following notification was accordingly issued by tlie British Consul on 6th July 1^03 ; In pursuance and by virtue of the powers vested in His Britannic Majesty's Consul by Article 1 of the Maskat Order in Council of 1867 — 'Rritish aubiects and British protected persons are hereby reminded that the Regulations British 8abjects^an(ii3 orc ^^ p^ ^ o£ His Highness against arrival at Maskat by sea, for the prevention of plague and other epidemic aiseases iq territories, are as follows M askat Q uauantine R egulations. m All vessels arrivin 0 * from ports affected with plague or other infectious disease ( ) are placeTin quarantine until ten days have elapsed sioee the date of the.r leaving the last infected ports.

(iii) Poposed return of Sayyid Ali bin Salim to Zanzibar. 660. Sayyid Ali bin Salim, a Zanzibar Sheikh, was a political exile in Maskat, deported in 1B9S for his being mixed up in some political intrigues. o t,. » , He had left his family behind. On his Seores March 1902, Nos. 108-109. • ixth-i.l i?ti arrival at Maskat, a sum or Rs. 200 was remitted to him by the Sultan of Zanzibar, for the purpose of settling down. But iio maintenance allowance was given him by the Zanzibar Sultan, as the practice was for political exiles from either of these two States (Zanzibar and Maskat) to be supported at the expense of the other and there was apparently no reason why an exception should be made in this case. The wife of Sayyid Ali bin Salim was at first allowed Rs. 200 a month by the Sultan of Zanzibar ; but this was reduced, because His Highness alleged that she misused the money in leading an irregular life (Mr. Cave, to the Foreign Office, dated 20th November 1901). 661. The Sultan of Maskat complained that Sayyid Ali bin Salim was an unnecessary burden on him, and pressed Secret E., August 1901, Nos. 94-112. ,-1 i* i ♦ j .- i * / , r ,i. • u • s the Political Agent to obtain him per mission to return and Mr. Cave writing to the Political liesident in the Persian Gulf on 8th December 1899 said that he could not advise the Snltan of Zanzibar to comply with Sayyid Faisal's request (No. 43dated 5th December 1899). 662. As to the allowance, the Sultan of Zanzibar would be willing to allow Sayyid Ali a monthly grant, if he were to secret e., August 1901, Noa. 94.112. reside elsewhere than in Maskat, e.^., in Bombay or Mecca. But Sayyid Ali preferred to remain at Maskat (Captain Cox to Colonel Kemball, No. 217, dated 4th June 1901). 663. In August 1902, the question of return of this exile to Zanzibar was asain raised, the late Sultan * f Secrat e ., Apni 1903, Nos. 182-186. Zanzibar having died in the meanwhile. It was however reported that the uncle of the present Sultan, in whose favour Sayyid Ali had been intriguins:, was still living, and that therefore his return would be likely to lead to troubles and intrigues (Mr. Cave, to Foreign Office, dated 4th November 190^). 664. In November 1903, when His Excellency the Viceroy visited Maskat, the Sultan repeated his request for per- Sccret e., June 1904, N ob . 447.462. mission for Sayyid Ali bin Salim's return, and in December 1903, Major Cox submitted a written undertaking from Sayyid Ali, in which he solemnly affirmed that he intended to visit Zanzibar solely to see bis family, and agreed that ' it shall be open to the Zanzibar Government to expel me forthwith from its territory, if I am guilty of any act which is objectionable to them.'* 665. In view of this solemn assurance, the Zanzibar Government consented to his return (Foreign Despatch No. 1025-E.A., dated olst March 1904, to Political Agent, Maskat). We were informed by telegram from Maskat on 17th May 1904 that he left the place for Zanzibar via Bombay on that date. 666. Mr. S. Rogers informed Sir C. Elliot on 4th February 1904 that it was rumoured that Ali bin Salim's real object of visiting Zanzibar was to collect funds for setting up intrigue against Sayyid Faisal and to oust him from his place. 667.

Piracies and massacre of the Survivors of the Baron Inverdale. i) A leged Piracy of the Fateh-er-Rahman off the island of Maseirah, 1903. 6cK°. In June 1903 Alimed-biu-Miana, a native of Kutch, made a com- , _ r , plaint before the British Consul at Maskat Secret B,i July 1905, No». 104-110. i, , i- ji n i l i&gt; , / , tliat as his dhow Fateh-er-Rahman (of whi^h he was part owner), flying the British flag, was off the Maseirah island, it was waylaid by a number of native islanders, plundered of all its gear, oars and three sails, cargo, provisions and cash and left adrift in the ocean, and that after three days the dhow was wrecked on the island. The Nakhoda and his crew after remaining twelve days on shore, were taken and landed by some of the people at Sur. The Nakhoda claimed now Us. 3,862 as damages for the loss of his vessel, provisions, cargo and cash plundered. Another part owner of the dhow laid a complaint before His Majesty's British Consul- General at Zanzibar. 669. Commander Kemp of the Sphinx made some investigation into the case, but as he was not satisfied with the truth of the story, it was decided not to press the Sultan to exact a punitive fine from the natives of the island. 670. Soon after these events there occurred the massacre of the crew of the S, S. Baron Inverdale, and in the light of the recent discoveries, there was rea son to believe that the complaint of the Nakhoda of tiie Fateh-er-Rahman was based on facts. The Poreign and India Offices, however, decided concurring in the opinions expressed by Major Cox and Mr. Cave, that no further action should be taken in the matter (see correspondence sent to the Foreign Depart, ment here by Major Grey with his letter dated 27th Eebruary 1905). tii) Wreck of the Baron Inverdale off the KuriaMnria Islands, Massacre of seventeen of its survivors on the Maseirah Island, August 1904. 671. The Baron Inverdale was a steam ship belonging to the Hoorarth b „,. t e.. febru.ry i 9 oe, No.. 8 t2 . 139 , Shipping Company Glasgow, of a regis- tered tonnage of 2,140 tons. It left Karachi • Europran. (3 EnjH.taen) ..d 6 N.tire,. J'!'. Sai,i , 0n 20th l 90 i' W,th a full cargo and a crew of 29* (?30) hands, and one passenger. The ship stranded on one of the Kuria Muria Islands on 2nd August 1904. On the 6th. August the master, the passenger and all the crew left the stranded ship on two life-boats intending to proceed to Dhofar, while 8 remained behind and were rescued by the S. S. Prome on the 17th of August and landed at Port Said. They were found to be Greeks, and knew nothing of the fate of the rest after the latter had left the ship. 672. On the 29th August Captain Grey wired to Simla of the wreck of the Baron Inverdale. On the 31st August Captain Grey reported the rumoured massacre near Maseirah of seventeen of the survivors of the vessel. The Dalhousie from Aden visited the wreck on 1st September and found the vessel deserted. On 1st September the Lapioing was despatched to Maseirah, and after going all round the island, could find no trace of the massacre, and reported that everybody on the island disclaimed all knowledge of the murder. Captain Grey and the Sultan then left for the island on 10th September on the Merlin and returned on 18th September, when he reported that no confirma tory evidence against the Maseirah people was forthcoming and that no trace of the crime existed there. 673. With a view to making the investigation on the spot into the circum- Secret B, February 1905, Noi. 342-439(No. 382). stai ? c - es attending the massacre, the Sultan revisited Maseirah on the 26th September 1904. The investigations were so far successful that he returned to Maskat on the 8th October with nine of the murderers; a dozen other prisoners, including some principal residents of Dawwa and Um-ar-Rassas, who helped to conceal the crime on the occasion of his former visit ; and certain relics. So far as the facts are ascertainable, it appears that the boat containing 17 persons, of whom 13 were Englishmen, three natives, and one an European or an Eurasian147 boy, arrived in Maseirah Channel from tbe south reaching Ras Half, where the occupants were subsequently murdered and their valuables plundered. Afterwards some residents of Dawwa, hearing of the massacre, arrived on the spot, and advised the residents of Eas Half and Jadufa to burn the boat and all traces of the crime. Ibis was done, but insufficiently. 174. It was decided to let the Sultan deal with the delinquents, as it was essential that he should assert his author- Ibid, No. 384. ity, and the Political Agent, Maskat, was permitted to acquiesce in the pro posal of the Sultan to shoot the murderers on the scene of the massacre and to hang their bodies on poles as a warning to the Bedouins generally. He was further authorised on ^4th October 1904 to approve of the suggested im prisonment of the principal residents of Dawwa and Um-ar-Hassas, and to propose, as recommended—(«) the burning of the village of Ras Half with confiscation of any arms found ; (ft) the deportation of the Slieikh of Um-ar- Eassas ; (c) the execution of the remaining murderers, about 10 in number, on arrest ; and {d) the stationing of a guard of Maskat soldiers by the Sultan on the island for the protection of native craft and other vessels, as a previous case of brigandage has been reported in which a number of Bedouins spent the monsoon at Ras Half on purpose to plunder any boats or Bughlas that may be wrecked on the shore. The Political Agent, on enquiry made by the Secretary of State as to whether it would be practicable to secure monetary compensation for the relatives oi the murdered men, suggested the recovery of a line from the Jennebeh Sheikhs at Sur, and from others concerned. It was thought that bv this means a sum of £500 might be recovered. The wrecked vessel was salved and transferred to her owners. She arrived at Perim on the 2ord October 1904. 675. The Political Agent left Maskat in H.M. S. Merlin for Maseirah on 3rd November to witness the execution of the murderers already secuied out of those concerned in the massacre of a party of survivors from the S. S 'Baron Tnverdale ' Accompanying him in the Sultan s steamer were Sayyid rammr and Mahomed-bin-Said, with about 70 Arab sepoys. The Sultan himself did not so The programme actuallv carried out dillered slightly from that originally approved owing to the Sultan's feeling having been worked upon bvletters received from various Sheikhs, in which the writers begged him to deal as leniently as possible with the criminals. The party first proceeded ^ to Dawwa arriving there about mid-day on the 4th instant, in hopes of securing fhe cultit who ^as believed to be still on the island, but failed to find lam The lext mornin' they burnt the village of Ras Half, some miles dxstant. Stone masons erected two monuments, one to act as a perpetual reminder to the tribes nf nunishment which overtook the perpetrators of a certain crime, and the sLo JovS the graves of the unfortunate victims of the massacre. The Arab escort proceeded to the Sur-ul-Bahr, and returned with the criminals. A com- ™*v of sailors from H. M. S. M'rlin having first been brought ashore to Srj+nooa tlie execution, in order to make the scene more impressive and to en dorse the intimate relations which exist between the Sultan and His Majesty s Government, the prisoners were shot, and their bodies thrown into a grave already prepared, 'without the usual attentions or funeral rites. JThe Arabs then returned to their vessels, before party re-embarked. Tney returned to Maskat on the 7th November. ^ u fnr. a s reeards the suggested recovery of a fine from the tribes, members ^ of which were concerned in the Maseirah ibid, No. 408. incident, the Political Agent explained (Ist November) that they belonged to different tribes as detailed^below ^ Those in custody.

The Secretary of State was, therefore, asked f26th November) to let the matter of compensation drop ; as to exact compensation from one tribe only would possibly drive the local Sheikhs into the arms of the French. 677. This proposal was approved by the Secretary of State. 678. From enquiries made it appears that 13 Europeans were murdered who were all said to be Englishmen, with four natives, and appear to have been in one boat. The other boat, it was guessed, must have been lost at sea (telegram from Political Agent, dated ^th December 1904). 679. At the request of the Government of India Major Cox submitted a secret e., august i9c5, Nos. 32i-34o. repoi t with his recommendations on the , . , . ., - various points that had further arisen out of the Maseirah incident. In reply he was told that in view of the question of compensation having been dropped, there seemed no good reason for further complying with the Sultan's request for refund of part of the coal expenses incurred by him in the course of his trips to Maseirah, and that as regards the release of the prisoners connected with the affair, he should request the Sultan to inform them and their relatives that their best way of securing their speedy release would be for the Jennebeh and other tribes to deliver up the murderers whom they were harbouring. Major Cox was asked to report again on the latter point in due course (letter, dated 25th May 1905). . 680 - Ma j or Co x telegraphed on 3rd June that one more of the Maseirah prisoners had died and that the release of two others had been permitted by the Political Agent, Maskat. Under the circumstances he hoped that the Government o India would acquiesce in the release. He was informed in replv that a decision was deferred pending receipt of his reply to our letter dated 25th May. 631. Major Cox forwarded a copy of a letter from the Political Agent at Maskat, m which that officer suggested as the outcome of report called 'for on the 25th May, m connection with the Maseirah incident, that for every murderer surrendered one prisoner be released, the prisoners not so released to remain in confinement up to a period not exceeding three years from the date of their incarceration. The proposals were approved, and Major Grey was instructed through the ^ 1 ohtical Resident to inform the Sultan accordingly, but without mentioning as yet the intended limitation or the period of imprison ment to three years. ^ A report was also to be furnished to the Government of Inchaon 0 ^ c ^ 10 5 0 f each surrender and release (Foreign Department letter Jso. 2837-E.E., dated 22nd July 1905).149 CHAPTER XXIX. British Subjects and British ex-territorial jurisdiction. (i) Question of Revisional Jurisdiction of tlie High Court of Bombay over Criminal Proceedings of tlie British Consul at Maskat, 1899—1900. 682. In June 1899, Major Fagan in his capacity as Consul and Political external a., february i9oo, nos. 6 —8. Agent, Maskat, called upon Hatansi external a., april liioo, ko. i. Pursliotam, to report to the Agency whe ther or not he was in possession of a power-of-attorney authorising him to act as Agent at Maskat for Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm. The accused, says Major Fa^an, practically declined to give him the information, for which offence Ratansi had to pay a penalty in the shape of a fine of Es. 200 plus 7 days' simple imprisonment. 683. Eatansi filed an application for the revisional jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court, hut it was held hy that Court that it had no such juris diction over the criminal proceedings of the Consul at Maskat (Judgmenti dated 6th December 1899). 684.. Neither the papers nor the judgment of Major Pa^an show under what law or regulation or in what case he called upon Ratansi to give him the information required. (ii) Memorial from certain British Indian subjects residing in Maskat praying for the revision of the Maskat Order in Council of 1867. 685. The recent proceedings of Major Fagan were soon followed by a memorial addressed to the Bombay Gov- Extemai a ., October i9co, Nos. 18 -20. eminent by certain British Indian sub jects of Maskat praying for the revision of the Maskat Order in Council oi 1867 by providing for the introduction of the Criminal Procedure Code in the Maskat Agency Court, and for the appearance of pleaders in that Court and by certain other amendments, 686. Captain Cox was of opinion that the Order in Council had worked smoothly without hardship in the past and was quite sufficient to meet the requirements of Maskat ' in the present.' Colonel Kemball held the same opinion. The Bombay Government was accordingly told to inform the peti. tioners that no sufficient cause existed for the introduction of the changes desired by them (No. 1823'E. A., dated 11th September 1900). (iii) Acquisition and transfer of immovable property in Maskat by British subjects and British protected persons. 687 In his despatch to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. No. 424, dated 21st September 1902, Major Cox Secret e., October 1902, No. 116. pointed out that frequent applications were made to him bv the Indian baniahs for delivery of possession of lands of Arabs mortgaged to'them, which the Arahs were unable to redeem, that to refuse the applications was calculated to damage the British prestige, but to interfere to rouse a««»-British feeling. Secondly, there was danger of the Indian Baniahs who owned many buildings and buildmg sites, disposing of them to foreigners like the Russians and intriguing Frenchmen like M. Qoguyer. As this second reason was a pressing one. Major Cox published the following notification ;— notification. Tn Diireuance of tUpower and authority vested in His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Maskat bv Article 1 of the Maskat Order in Council, dated 4th November 1867, for the .&lt;.... SMX sftjsa160 from the date of this notification British and British-protected subjects are hereby prohibited under penalty of fine or imprisonment, or both, from alienating or acquiring to or from any British, British-protected or non-British subject, any land or household property within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, either by gift, purchase, mortgage or other form of conveyance, without due execution of signature and registration in His Britannic Majesty's Consulate at Maskat previous to the transfer of such property. Given under my hand and seal this 13th day of September 1902. P. L. COX, Major) Eis Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. 687A. It was discovered by the Foreign Office in London that the words in Secrat E.. April 1803. No., 209-211. ^ .^ 0Ve , notification ' British-protected subjects were incorrect, and in their place under orders of Lord Lansdowne the words ' British subjects and British-protected persons ' were substituted, the latter being not British eubjeots, but persons who not being such, are yet afforded British protection (Foreign Office to Major Cox, dated 4th December 1902).151 CHAPTER XXX. Medical arrangements at Maskat. British Agency Establishments and Buildings. Landing arrangements at Maskat, etc. (i) Medical arrangements at Maskat, 1900-1905. 688. The Agency Surgeon Captain Smith drew attention to the condition of the medical arrangements at Maskat Exterual a., September 1900, Nos. 30 -31. ^ j etter 37^ foted 22nd May 1900. They consisted of— (1) The Agency dispensary established for the treatment of the Agency employes, the treasury guard and the British subjects. It was also largely availed of by the Sultan's subjects. (2) The Sultan's dispensary under the supervision of a retired Hospital Assistant, who also superintended the quarantine arrange ments. (3) A Plague Hospital in charge of another retired Government medical subordinate. The Agency Surgeon had no connection with the last two. 689. The Agency dispensary premises consisted of a house Placed rent- free at the disposal of Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar in 1873. The building did not afford sufficient accommodation and was not fit even with altera tions for a suitable bospital and dispensary. The establishment consisted of— A 1st Class Hospital Assistant, A peon, A night watchman. It was necessary to add to it A compounder, A bhisti, A sweeper and Two punkah coolies. The equipment o£ the dispensary was very inadequate. The hospital expenses were home partly by local suhsonptioa amounting to about Es 130 per mensem and partly by Imperial funds which bore the following items (1) Pay of staff. (2) Rs. 120 house rent of the Assistant Surgeon. (3) Rs. 240 for the menial establishment. (4) Us. 250 for medical stores. (5) Es 200 for bazaar medicines and hospital contingencies.

In June 1904 Major Grey submitted a proposal for providing a Eitem.i a., Kovenjber 1904, K03. 58-59. new building for the dispensary and hospital at Maskat. He thought that a subscription of Es. 10,000 could be eaeily collected at Maskat, and proposed, if the idea is approved, to ask the Sultan to give us the site on which the present buildings are situated. The Government of India saw no objection to the proposal, provided the loan and hospital questions were kept distinct. 692B. In January 1905 Major Grey submitted a list of subscriptions for external a*, april 1905, nos. 74-75. tlie proposed hospital amounting to Rs. 6,450, and proposed that the Government of India should offer Rs. 10,000 or Es. 15,000 in aid of the movement, in which case more subscriptions would be forthcoming and the Sultan would ' give way ' as to the site required. The Government of India replied as follows in their letter to Maior Cox (No. 1288-E. 13., dated 29th March 1905) ' In rep y I am to say that this not a suitable manner in which to put forward such a scheme. Major Grey should be informed that until satisfactory evidence has been adduced that the Sultan desires the hospital and will support it, and that the local community, Arabs and Indians, are prepared both to found and maintain the institution, it is useless to apply to the Government of India, who already maintain a dispensary and surgeon at Maskat. (ii) Agency Establishment, Maskat, 1901-1902. 693. The establishment of the Maskat Agency as finally sanctioned in External b., February i9oi, Nos. 28-31. i oreigu Department Is o. 91-E.

He also thought it desirable that quartBrs should he prOTndcd for tho Atrencv Establishment. In Foreign Departmtment letter No. 1887-E.

The Government of India decided that, in view of the costliness of the project for a pier of breakwater, it would be advisable first to see whether the suggested deepening of the Dweira channel would mitigate the present difficulties. They accordingly sanctioned the latter scheme (Foreign Depart- ment letter No. 4194-E.B., dated 14th December 1904). ^ . !2 3, Ma3 * 0r 9 0X in his let . ter Na 148 ' dated 28th May 1904, pointed out tnat the proposal for the pier and breakwater was based on the opinion expressed by Adnnral Eosanquet that it was desirable to provide better facilities for communication between His Majesty's ships and the shore at low water in bad weather. [The Foreign Department Proceedings, External A., June 1905, Nos. 10— 30, contain interesting reports about the Maskat harbour, the winds blowing into it, and several sketches of the harbour.] \ ^.V ^'CORDS X // G.
