Some time ago it was decided by the Commerce Department of the Government of India who are responsible for the Marine lighting of the Persian Gulf to erect a light on Kabbar Island as a Navigational aid to vessels approach Kuwait. As you are aware Kabbar Island is situated on the Empire Air Route from Basra to India and from enquiries it was ascertained that if this light were an Aero-Maritime Beacon it would be of great assistance to Empire Aircraft. Consequently in accordance with the Resolution of the International Air Commission for Air Navigation at its 25th Session in June 1937 - M that when erecting new Marine lights the question of erecting Aero-Maritime lights should be investigated 1 *. It was suggested to the Commerce Department of the Government of India that Kabbar Island Light should be constructed as an Aero-Maritime Beacon. After due consideration the Government of India Commerce Department decided that they would meet the cost of a maritime beacon but had no objection to erecting an aero- maritime beacon provided the Air Ministry would undertake to meet the difference in cost between a marine beacon and an aero-maritime/ .E. the British Ambassador, British Embassy, Bagdad.aero-maritime beacon and have authorised me to approach the Air Ministry on the subject. As the matter is one of importance to Aircraft using the Iraqi Corridor may the Air Ministry be approached through the Foreign Office to give this Kabbar Island Aero-Maritime Light their early consideration. The type of light proposed is an Aga (Gas Accumulator Coy) unattended aero-maritime beacon, the optic would be the same as used on the electric oscillating route and course indicating beacon in Iraq, Egypt and elsewhere. It consists of two panels of 150 M/M. focal length rotating at 2 revolutions per minute the divergence being 6 degrees and light characteristic a single £ second flash every 15 seconds. The light power derived would be 60,000 candles aeronautical range of 30 miles. The Geographical Marine range of 12 miles will be obtained by restricting the elevation of the focal height to about 15 feet. The grant for erecting the marine light is £700 and the additional amount required to construct an aero-maritime beacon is £3,000 and the additional cost of maintenance will be £30 per annum. I expect to be in England next month and would be glad to discuss the matter with the Air Ministry if they so desire. As however the Marine Light is being held up pending a decision it is requested that the matter be given early attention. I have , etc., (signed) J. C. Ward.

Prom Rai Sahib A.N.Puri, B.A. ,LL,B. , Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, To The Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy, Bombay. Subject:- Establishment of a light on Rubber Island . Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. PG/2120, dated the 8th June 1937, on the above subject, I am directed to convey the sanction of the Central Government to the establishment of a light on Rubber Island in the Persian ‘Tulf at an estimated initial cost of Rs.9,134 (Rupees nine thousand, one hundred and thirty four) and a recurring cost of approximately Rs.2,050 (Rupees two thousand and fifty) per annum. 2. The Central Government agree that if a spare flasher of the same type and burner capacity as the original one can be obtained from the Basra Port Directorate^ stock, it need not be purchased for the light on Rubber Island. It may, however, be observed that there is no likelihood of a spare flasher deteriorating if original and spare are both used alternately to keep them in working order, as is customary in such cases. 3. I am to add that in his letter No. 2/^^*, dated the 2nd July, 1935, the Port Director, Basra, stated that the range of the proposed light would be 12 miles in clear weather with the height of observer at 30 feet. As the usual practice is to calculate the range with the height of observer at 15 feet, the range of the proposed light would work out to 10.5 miles, but should be advertised as 10 miles.

I have the honour to fb rward for the consideration of Ihe Commerce Department a copy of letter No.2/5202/306, dated 2nd July, 1935, from the Port Director, Basra, on the above subject. The proposal was placed before the Advisory Committee at its meeting held on 10th December, 1935 and it was resolved that it should be circulated to the Members to enable them to ascertain the views of the concerns they represented. Replies received from the Members are forwarded herewith. It will be seen therefrom that the majority of the Members are in favour of the establishment of a light at Rubber Island.40 / F.Z.5547/37 0 Headquarters, Port Direcotrate, Basrah. ’ Iraq.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith for your information a copy of a letter received from the Master of Messrs. F.C. Strick &amp; Go’s s.s. 'Oorjistan” with reference to the establishment of a light on Kubber Island. There is no doubt that a light established on this island, as suggested by the master, would be of valuable assistance to vessels making the Port of Kuwait at night, but I am extremely doubtful whether the amount of shipping justifies it. I suggest that the views of the Chipping Companies be obtained in this connection. The cost of this light would be approximately Rs.9134/- making up as follows, excluding maintenance charges, which would amount to approximately Rs.2050/- per annum including hire of the Light Tender.

(18)/36, dated the 8th January, 1937, from the Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Commerce, New Delhi, to the Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy, Bombay. Subject:- Establishment of a light at Rubber Island . With reference to your letter No. PG/3970 dated the 24th November, 1936, on the above subject, I am directed to say that the Government of India observe that although the proposal to establish a light at Rubber Island, in the approaches to Kuwait, is supported by a majority of the members of the various shipping concerns, it does not find favour with Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie and Company, whose ships form the bulk of tonnage entering and leaving Kuwait annually. The Port Director, Basrah is also extremely doubtful whether the amount of shipping justifies the installation of the light at present. In these circumstances the Government of India feel unable to sanction the proposal on the information available and would be glad to know whether you have any special reasons for recommending the establishment of the light in spite of the opposition of Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie and Company and the Port Director, Basrah. 2. In this connection I am also to say that the Engineer-in- Chief, Lighthouse Department, observes that only one flasher has been allowed for in the estimate of the cost of the proposed light and suggests that in order to prevent any prolonged stoppage of the light during repairs and/or overhauls a spare flasher should be provided. I am accordingly to request that this point also may be examined and a revised estimate submitted to the Goverrment of India, if necessary.Copy of a letter No. PG/2120 dated the 8th June, 1937, from the Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy, Bombay, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Commerce, Simla. Subject : - Establisliment of a light on Rubber Island . With reference to Commerce Department letter No. 6-P.&amp; L. (18)/36 of 8th January, 1937, I have the honour to state that a very definite majority of Shipping Companies are in favour of the establishment of the light. 2. Taking into consideration that the ships of four large Companies regularly trade to Kuwait, that the port is frequently used by H.M.Ships, and that there is every indication of an increase in shipping owing to the advent of oil, the Port Director, Basra, is definitely of opinion that a light should be established on Rubber Island. I entirely agree v/ith this view. 3. As regards para. 2 of the Commerce Department letter under reference, I do not consider that a spare flasher for Rubber Island Beacon will be necessary. The flasher should be serviceable for, at least, 7 years and a spare one would deteriorate if kept in stores unused. In the event of a total breakdown, or during periodical overhauls, a spare flasher can be issued on loan from the Basra Port Directorate^ stock as is now done in the case of the Muscat light.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001e8_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3918</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001e8</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3918</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/180 'Kuwait:- Establishment of a light on Kubber Island.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1941</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-02-05T22:41:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (18 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 19; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the establishment of a light for shipping (and rejected proposals for an aero-maritime beacon) on Kubber Island (also referred to as Kubbar Island), in the approaches to Kuwait.
