Key geographical features, specifically the Shatt Al-Arab and its creeks, are indicated in black ink. Also shown in black ink are: villages, buildings, railway lines, and numerous other facilities, most labelled with text (P. of W. [prisoner of war] camp, British Cemetery, hospitals, Anglo-Persian Oil Company buildings, etc.). Some sites are shaded red.The map also indicates various types of roads, and uses various colours and styles of line to distinguish between them, as follows:solid red lines: concrete roads;long-dashed red lines: metalled roads;short-dashed red lines: proposed metalled roads;solid green lines: kutcha roads;dotted green lines: proposed kutcha roads;solid yellow lines: civil roads;long-dashed yellow lines: proposed civil roads.In the bottom right corner of the map are two reproduced signatures, both of which are unclear. The first is dated 9 January 1919. The second is dated 25 May 1917 and is annotated 'Captain I. A. R. Assist. Director of Works River Front.' Further text underneath the signatures states that the map was reproduced by the Basrah Survey Party, I.E.F.D [Indian Expeditionary Force D], No. 81, dated 12 June 1917. Text at the bottom left of the map states that the map was reproduced by Survey Party M.E.F No. 389, dated 30 January 1919.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100035794547.0x000005#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
