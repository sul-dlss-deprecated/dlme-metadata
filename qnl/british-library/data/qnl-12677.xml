            Resident has received word indicating that Fatḥ ‘Alī Shāh Qājār, the Shah of Persia, has
            arrived at Isfahan [Eşfahān]; the Resident is not aware of the reasons as to why the
            Shah has left Tehran, but he suspects it may be in consequence of an outbreak of cholera
            there. The letter outlines the impact this will have on Prince Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā's
            plans for an expedition to take Bahrain, and notes that the Resident has reason to
            believe that Shaik Abdol Russool [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān] may not fulfil his
            commitments to the expedition. It is noted that the Prince is determined to remove him
            from the Government of Bushire should he fail to meet this commitment.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000094#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
