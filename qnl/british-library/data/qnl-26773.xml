Paragraph 4 (ij^cj of the Lease/Lend White Paper (flagged on file below)* therefore covers this ,so there is no technical reason*why we should not support the application. Keymers said that hitherto, Nepal had manufactured the Martini-Henrcartridge, an old relic of the Boer War, and that they had decided before the war to change over to the modern Lee-Enfield cartridge. He suggested that they were one of the few countries still using the Martini-Henr^. Incidentally, Keymers seemed most indignant that there should be any question about granting the renewal and he quoted the provisions of the 1923 Treaty with Nepal,as support. You looked up this point, however, and it covers freedom to import armaments for the defence of Nepal from or through India which, as you pointed out, is only a transit grant and does not cover exports from this country. The consignment is ready for shipment ana I reminded Keymers that they would have to come to us for shipping support. They mentioned that the Nepalese Minister was anxious that the machinery should go as early as possible. All things considered, we have good grounds for supporting the renewal and I have put up a draft reply to the War Office for signature.Whitehall 9400 * o » ±lo 0 ’ a# vfS»- FILE COPY ~zirS~ 145 The War Office, 2 of^te f ^ V Whitehall, (■ S.

In such circumstances we do not consider it advisable for us to go in for V.B.Guns and I have to beg of you to inform the Government of India that we would be requiring neither the 50 new V.B.Guns which they have kindly said they would be able to provide us with in 1940 nor the used ones wither later on* As stated above we had in view tne desirability of having Bren Guns but had to keep the idea at abeyance because of difficulty in getting them* It appears from the information given by you that we may now be able to have a supply of Bren Guns mcsiufactured in England.

Vickers Armstrongs on the above subject for the information of the Government of India. A particular point in this letter has been made that the guns to be supplied by Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs should include certain modifications which have been incorporated in guns supplied to the Army in India by the Messrs. Vickers have therefore asked for particulars of the Ishapore Mark III gun. The position is a somewhat difficult one in that it is understood that the Mark III gun is restricted by patents which would necessitate permission by the Government of India prior to manufacture by Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs. It would appear that the simplest procedure would be for the Government of India to supply these guns direct to the Nepalese if this course of action would commend itself to the latter Government. Before approaching the Foreign Office, however, with a view to this tentative suggestion being conveyed to the Nepalese Legation, it is desirable to ascertain whether the Government of India would be in a position to supply the guns if asked to do so and approximately by what date. 1 /I am therefore to ask for the favour of their observations.

As stated in the earlier correspondence the Vickers Berthier Mark III gun is an improved model of the Vickers Berthier Mark II gun which is manufactured hy Vickers Armstrong Limited. Mark III is manufacted lca~^ (under from Vickers) in the Government Factories in India for the use of the army in that country. It has 'been officially patented through the War Office and cannot he manufactured (even hy Vickers themselves; without the consent of the Government of India. Even supposing such permission is granted it is unlikely that Vickers could execute the Nepalese order for a very long time ©wing to priority of British requirements. In such circumstances Vickers have given their consent to the manufacture in the Indian factories of the 50 guns required hy the Nepalese Government. The Government of India on their part are prepared to supply the guns required at theapproximate cost mentioned in Sir Aubrey Metcalfe’s letter of 5th September, hut not until 1940 . c Such are the facts and the next step is to explain the position to the Nepalese and if possible try and persuade them to accept delivery from India in 1940.

Dear K- 5. © On 15th September last we wrote to Rumbold • on the question of the supply of fuzes to Nepal, through the agency of Messrs. Donald Bagley, Ltd. 2 . We now have a request from the firm of Tavaro S.A., Geneva, the makers of the fuzes, for permission to negotiate with Donald Bagley for India* We think there is little doubt that this transaction originated with the enquiry for fuzes by Nepal. 5 . In view of the confusion which is being caused in this case we thought it might be possible for you or the Foreign Office to take the matter up with the Nepalese authorities and explain to them that if they want Tavaro fuzes^-and it is difficult to see why they should^ it would be much better if they ordered through the War Office. 4 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Ronald at. the Foreign Office. C.F. Crombie, Esq., India Office, LONDON, S.W.l.c . Cj^ xS' ; UiDXA OFF1C nth July, 1938. Your M.I.2/374 of 5th July. We are in entire agreement with your ^rojjosed reply to the Nepalese M.A., paruicaiarly the last paragraph. It is suggested that you might add the fact that the cost of the V .13. gun from the Government of India works out to about Us. 1320/- (2140) and that it is, therefore, a cheaper proposition than the Bren gun from Czechoslovakia. Ma -5 — T Cawthorn Jar Office \M.I.2/574 The War Office, London, S.W.l. 5th Jnly, 1938. Dear Davies, Early in June the Nepalese M.A. came to see me and said that his Government were anxious to acquire 4 or 5 Bren guns for experimental purposes with a view to deciding whether to adopt the Bren as the light machine gun in the Nepalese Army. He asked whether he could he supplied as soon as possible with details of the gun, its price, and a delivery date for, say, 5 guns. He was unable to say how many guns his Government would require should they decide to adopt it. As a result of discussions here we propose to reply as in the letter attached. Before doing so I thought it better to let you see and would be glad if you would let Gibson and Symon see it. I have discussed with them on the telephone the status of Nepal in regard to our contract with the BRNO Company, which does not permit us to supply to other than All parts of H.M. Dominions, Protectorates, Protected States, Mandated territories, The Sudan. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) W.J. Cawthorn. Lieut.-Col. H.L. Davies, D.S.O., M.C., Military Department, India Office.War Office, London, S.W.l. 1st July 1938. Dear In continuation of our conversation on the 9th June, regarding Bren guns; I am sorry to say that under the terms of the agreement with the BRNO Company for the manufacture of these guns by His Majesty’s Government, we are precluded from supplying them to foreign powers. In these circumstances it will be necessary for you to obtain your requirements direct from the BRNO Company. They are able to produce Brens to British specification, which varies slightly from (and we think is an improvement on) that of the pattern normally sold by them. We would suggest, therefore, that should you decide to order from the Company, you ask for the British pattern. It is believed that the price ex Czecho-Slovakia for the gun, accessories and spares, including mounting, is from £175 to £200. The address of the Company is Ceskoslovenska Zbrojovka, Akciova Spolecnost, BRNO, CZECHOSLOVAKIA. I attach the details of the gun for which you asked. As regards ammunition, ordinary .303 small arms ammunition is used, and that manufactured in India would do equally well. You may remember my discussing with you the 7 advantages, other things being equal, of your adopting the V.B. gun, which is in use in India, rather than the Bren, in view of the greater facility with which your requirements could be met.

According to our information the Government of India are fully desirous of supplying 50 Vickers Berthier guns to Nepal and state they will be in a position to supply the guns in 1940, provided that Messrs.

Vickers Armstrongs regarding the sale of Vickers Berthier guns, manufactured in India, to the Governments of Burma, Australia and Nepal. 2. As regards Burma, I am to say that when the negotiations for the supply and manufacture of the Vickers Berthier gun were in progress during 1933-34, the Government of Burma had not then been separated from the Government of India. The question, therefore, of Burma being considered as a separate Government from India has not, heretofore, arisen, and presumably Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs will put forward no objections to the supply of the V. 3. gun by the Government of India to Burma in the future. Confirmation of this is requested. 3 . In regard to the Government of India ! s reference to ’outside* Governments I am to say that reference to India has indicated that the Government have in mind supply of V.B. guns to Australia and Nepal in particular, but that any agreement now reached with Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs in respect of these two countries should be without prejudice to extension later on so as to cover all British Territories which would be included in the self-contained Eastern group for munitions supply as suggested at the recent Imperial Conference. 4* I am also to request that it may be confirmed with Messrs Vickers Armstrongs that they would have no objection to supply of the V.B. gun by the Government of India to any of the The Director of Army Contracts, War Office, S.W.1. Indian/Indian Native States who may require such equipments in the future. 5 . To summarise therefore, I am to request that negotiations may he opened with Messrs Vickers Armstrongs to - (a) Confirm that they have no ohsections to the Government of India supplying Burma with the V.B. gun, and to determine the terms under which such supply may he made hy the Government of India to the Governments of Australia and Nepal. (h) That the Government of India’s right to supply to Indian Native States may he confirmed. (c) That any agreement reached should he without prejudice to the future extension of such agreement to cover other British territories included in the Eastern Group for munitions supply as suggested at the Imperial Conference. 6.

The V.B. (Mark III) gun which the Nepalese Government have asked for is an improved model of the V. B. (Mark II) gun which is manufactured by Vickers Armstrong, Ltd. The improved Mark III gun is manufactured at the rifle factory at Ishapore for the use of the army in India. It has been officially patented through the War Office and cannot be manufactured (even by Vickers themselves) without the permission of the Government of India. Vickers have asked to see a specimen of the improved gun and their request has been referred to the Government of India for consideration. Even supposing that their request is granted, it is unlikely that they would be able to undertake the manufacture of the improved gun at present as their hands are full with British Government rearmament orders. In such circumstances, General and his advisers are of opinion that an endeavour should be made to induce the Nepal Government to obtain their requirements of the improved gun from the Government of India, and, on instruction)from General Muspratt, the Ordnance Consulting Officer has already asked the Master General of the Ordnance in India to consider whether this can be arranged. In his Note below Colonel Barstow suggests that we should take up the matter with the Nepalese Legation, but I think that vie might defer an approach to the Nepalese until we get a reply to the enquiry which has been addressed to the Master General of the Ordnance in 6063 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 10P India/CABLEGRAMS: VICASTRONG LONDON. codes 1 bentley's, bentley.’s^p.A.bc. 6™, I MARCON I.’LIEBER’S,WESTERN UNION. . • 1 •' J J It 7 f 0\: 'K/J, i' p f ?

My dear Reference your letter of the 21st August with regard to alleged enquiries from the Nepalese lor a supply oi fuses. I have made enquiries about the firm of DonaldBagiey Ltd. ana I gather that there is nothing against them. Their chief objects seem to be to carry on the business of manufacturers, spinners, combers and merchants of artificial filaments and yarns. There is nothing to show that they are in any way connected with the supply of war material. suspicious and the procedure for conducting negotiations hardly suggests that it is genuine. It seems inconceivable that the Nepalese authorities would not deal through their Military Attache if they really wanted war material from this country and since we have always been in close touch with Sovag Jung I feel sure that he would have consulted us before making any enquiries from a private lirm. The nature of Mr. Schmocher's enquiry appears to be very Yours sincerely, A.A.F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 16 SEP 1937^ .

Geneva armament firm of Tavaro (which I am told is reputable). He came to the India Office to discuss with Colonel Crofton, our Ordnance Consulting Officer, a contract for the supply of fuses 4 - 0 - t ho •ft»verijri ant » i? i r ^ &gt;»*•, and ne was brought by Colonel Crciton to see .e. Major Haines of the War Office was also present. T Mr.Schmocker explained that he has * been approached by Donald Bagley Ltd., roputodly on behalf of the Nepalese Government^ to supply them with between 2,000 and 3,000 fuses per annum for use with 3” anti-aircraft guns. He said that he was going to meet a person called Knight who, he had been told, was the Nepalese Military Attache, which is of course not so. He asked whether tnere wa s any objection 1 0 ^ this-^-cnl-. I explained to him that Nepal was an independent country and that in accordance with the terms of our treaty with Nepal ^^l^fw’oul^give facilities for transit through India of munitions purchased by the Nepalese Government. But I gave Mr.Schmocker an emphatic warning that he should/should he quite certain that the peopl with whan he was negotiating had the authority of the Nepalese Government, and I advised him to establish direct contact with Sir Krishna Shumshere. 3 , Mr.Schmocker asked two further questions. Was there objection to the supply to the Nepalese Government of fuses of the same kind as were being (loo*' supplied to the Government of Ind-4e? Apparently the latter will be in Cc&gt; oorte.4-*H*y-»-=e-f a War Office pa-t-t-mra /V A Major iiaines explained that Messrs. Tevaro would have to obtain the permission of the War Office to contaiRwrs^e^-thio patt err, for the Nepalese. I said that if the War Office agreed the Government of India w^ould not raise objection. He also asked that War Office-inspectors might inspect the Nepalese fuses at the same HyM. % , time as they inspect 4doa Governments 0 # fuses at Geneva. I said that it would be necessary for the Nepalese Legation to take this question up with the War Office through the Foreign Office. 1 *.

Dear Bailey, Please refer to the correspondence enclosed with your official despatch No.l8/2/148-C dated the T 8 th February 1935. From secret information in possession of the Government of India it appears that in May 1934 Rameshwarlal Baza,] intended placing an order for 30 or 40 Vickers guns of .303 calibre, in addition to the rifles and military equipment referred to in Major Fraser-Tytler 1 s demi-official letter to Sir Clendon Daukes Ho. D.1799-X/34, dated the 10th April 1934. From the information now communicated in your official letter to the Foreign Office, London, No.£/145-C, elated the PBth February 1935, (copy enclosed with your despatch under reference), it would appear that this order for Vicker’s guns was placed in connection with Rameshwarlal Bazaj’s trans actions with the Nepal Government. Though notning objectionable has come to notice so far about his transactions, politically he is regarded with considerable susoicion. In 13£9 he was in correspondence with a Bengal Communist and a revolutionary. The contents of the letters were unobjectionable and merely revea.Lea that Bazaj was a staunch supporter of Swadeshi. In 1931 he was reported to have been a member of the Indian States 1 People’s Conference in London, and was also liberally but clandestinely subscribing to revolutionary organisations. In 1331 Bazaj was trying to obtain help for the Independent Labour Party, London, while in 1334 he was reported to be doing work in Dublin on behalf of the Indian Nationalist Movement. It is also understood that Shapurji Saklatvaia the well known Communist has claimed Bazaj as his friend. 2 . I am to request that the above information, which is communicated for your own personal knowledge, may kindly be treated as secret. The Government of India leave it to your discretion to mention the matter as information obtained from a very secret source, should you think It sullahle and desl-rstole t-o dto 1*12 in conversation with His Highness the Prime Minister, Yours sincerely.

As regards the penultimate paragraph of your letter under reply, the Nepalese Legation have already not only asked for but received all assistance in our power in the matter of the purchase of the guns in question, as you will see from the following summary of the transaction: On the 19th December last Sovag Jung informed us that his Government were contenplating the purchase of 36 machine guns in Belgium. Before doing so, hov/ever, they would like them thoroughly examined. They asked if the War Office would do this and at what cost. On the 31st December he was informed that the War Office were quite prepared to assist in the matter; and he was given an estimate of the charges that would be made for the service. On the 15th February last, Sovag Jung wrote to say that it had now been decided to purchase only 18 machine guns, and asked for revised estimates. These were furnished to him on the 19th February. The inspection of the guns was carried out between the 23rd February and the 8th March, and on the 29th March a report of the inspection was rendered to the Nepalese Legation.

It now appears that^while hitherto these deals were concerned with clothing, etc. and not munitions, Bazaj has now put a proposition before the Nepalese Government for the purchase of old Vickers machine guns which have been lying in Belgium since the Great War. Notes were exchanged with the Military Department in December and January (p.Z.7719/34) regarding information which we had received from a representative of the Soley Armament Company that Bazaj was negotiating abroad for munitions for Nepal. It is undesirable that Nepal should buy foreign arms^as we wish to preserve the t'«S uniformity of armament of the British and Nepalese Army and to prevent any foreign Power obtaining in Nepal the political influence which sometimes goes with the sale of munitions. Colonel Ismay of the D.M.I. offered at that time to discuss the question with Sovag Jung of the Nepalese Legation, whom he knows well, and warn him against the purchase of foreign arms. In view, however, of the danger of making the Nepalese,in their present frame of mind suspect that we wish to keep them from contact with other Governments, Colonel Ismay was asked not to take the action he suggested. The present deal regarding Vickers machine guns seems politically harmless. The only consideration prompting the Nepalese to buy in Belgium appears to be cheapness. It is, however, to our interest that Nepal should not get bad stock, and the War Office will no doubt be ready to help if aoproached by the Nepalese Minister/Minister pro^afei^/through the Foreign Office. We could, however, on the strength of the Maharaja of Nepal’s letter of 1st February take the initiative and offer assistance in the matter of the inspection Ox the guns, and the best channel would be for Colonel Ismay to tackle Sovag Jung informally. If the Foreign Office concur, we might suggest this to Colonel Ismay. ^ ccw vc*ey ^ co^u.Uvvv^ uSVe.^ V^cV&lt;vs^ v^^Cv-Ooh^s V&gt;&lt;.\:v^r3436a 5000 1.35 seems/ Department - 5 APR 1935 Col.H.L.Isma^r,CB. ,DSO. &gt; .Vai 1 Office, S • &lt;&lt; • 1 • 'I encloee a copy of some papers which we have received from the Minister at Kathmandu showing that the Nepalese are tninking of buying eighteen Vickers machine guns, which have been lying in Belgium since the Great War.

Dear Daukes, It has been brought to the notice of the Government of India that one Rameshwarlal Bazaj, son of ^ardyal Bazaj of Paniganj (Bengal), whose present address is 10£, Middle Abbey Str et, Dublin, has recently been buying military equipment in London, ostensibly for the Government of Nepal. It is understood that he endeavouring to secure 5,000 rifles (.303 calibre) and has aj-^o been negotiating for 18,000 to 20,000 khaki tunics. 2. It is reported that Bazaj has b?en in England since the end of 1925 where, it is believed, he has been doing export and import business in Indian toys. He is supposed to have transferred his business to Dublin towards the end of 1932. Since November 1925 it is stated that he has endeavoured, some times with success, to contract for the suoply of surplus Govern ment stocks for the Government of Nepal. His last venture in this direction is reoo ted to have been in 1930, when he negotiated for surplus Government stock of military equipment and on that occasion, it is understood that he produced official correspondence oroving the bona-fides of his transactions. 3. The Government of India would therefore be glad to know whether Rameshwarlal Bazaj has been authorised by the Government of Nepal to buy such military equipment on their behalf. • Yours sincerely, Sd/- W.fC.

With reference to your D.O. letter No. D.1789-X/34, dated the 10th Aoril 1934, I wrote to the Maharaja regarding Rameshwarlal Bazaj. His Highness informs me that the latter has been sending quotations for clothing and other ordinary goods to the Neoal Government from time to time and has occasionally obtained orders from the Ne al Government Foreign Goods Department for such articles. He has not, in the past, quoted for arms and ammunition, but he has recently, on his own initiative, sendT information to the Nepal Foreign Goods Department to the effect that some 2nd hand rifles and machine guns are available and can be obtained cheaply, his object being to get commission on any transaction that may take place.

In continuation of your letter to Coloael Macrae of 22nd January on the subject of Captain Ball and the Nepalese munitions question - Burnbold - in the Political Departraent, Near East, of this Office - was consulted snd his comments were to the effect:- (i; That we leave the question whether or not Captain Ball should be given the authorisation he desires entirely to the Y'ar Office. (ii; That he (Rumbold) doubted whether our evidence of the Nepalese enquiries on the Continent was sufficiently good to justify even the informal method of approach suggested by you. He further suggested it would be better to hold our hand until we are surer of the position. (iii; It does not seem necessary to consult the Foreign Office at this stage on either of these points. The problem, as it appears to me, is rather a delicate one/ Colonel H.L.Ismay, C.B.,D.S.O M.I.2, War Office, S.W.l.2 . one. There is no question whatsoever of the undesirability of the Nepalese having any dealings whatsoever with Foreign firms. I do not see how v.e are definitely to ascertain the fact of any pourparlers that are going on except through the method you suggest of having a perfectly frank talk with Sovag Jung as you so kindly suggested. Huinbold has unfortunately just gone abroad for a few weeks, and I am unable to talk over with him the points noted above. I feel moreover that we should not delay in this natter and X do suggest that if you know Sovar Jung sufficiently well that he should be approached. Perhaps we could further discuss this at the luncheon interval at the United Services Club. YoursP.&amp; J.(S) Secretary , It is understood, from a representative of the Soley Armament Company, that the Nepalese Government are using as their agent in the purchase of munitions in Europe an Indian resident in Dublin vjho, among his other activities, is concerned in the organisation of the Irish Sweepstakes. I do not know his name. He has put through more than one deal for the Nepalese Government with the Soley Armament Company who consider him to be a reliable person. If the P.&amp; J.(S) Department have any information about this individual which would throw light on his reputation it would probably be of use to this Department.(TO, :t _ | 7719 Lt 2 . 1 £ J Military Secretary , v. Please see the attached note of an interview between Captain John Ball of the Soley Armament Company and myself. I could not ascertain the reasons for Captain Bal^s request beyond that it would be more convenient to the Soley Armament Company if the procedure he suggests is followed. It may be something to do with the commissions which the Company has to pay. Prima facie it would probably be convenient for us if the Nepalese did go first to the Y/ar Office in these matters. We could then make arrangements for the War Office to keep us acquainted with the intentions of the Nepalese. But I suggest that the first step should be that your Department should ascertain demi officially from the Contracts Branch at the War Office what their view of this request is. We should, however, like to consult the Foreign Office before any reply is given; It might be worth while also to consult the War Office as to whether they have any information confirming Captain Ball’s statement that the Nepalese are negotiating for munitions on the Continent. The Government of India’s attitude tov/ards the purchase of arms by Nepal is flagged at P.Z. 5860/31 in the attached Military file, and also in the extract from a letter from the Chief of the General Staff flagged ,T X n on the attached Political Department file. It is that the Government would prefer Nepal to obtain arms and ammunition direct from firms in England. There are, however, objections ito Nepal going to the Continent. In the first place we do not want continental powers to obtain political influence in Nepal, and secondly there are, it is presumed, greater reasons/reasons than in the case of Afghanistan for the aimy of Nepal to he armed with the same rifle as the Indian Army. It will probably be desirable at a later stage to obtain the views of H.M.Minister at Kathmandu^in regard to tfri□ aeffcctr^of- the- ' /c ~Tfo Captain John Ball of the Soley Armament Company called at the India Office on the 13th December. He said that the Soley Armament Company had been set up at the desire of the War Office in order to dispose of surplus Government stock of -which they have a monopoly. The Company has had some dealings with the Nepalese Government who have used as their agent an Indian resident in Dublin who, among his other activities, is employed in connection with the organisation of the Irish Sweepstakes. The Nepalese have already ordered from the Soley Armament Company 40 Vickers machine guns, and 4,000 steel helmets. Further contracts are under discussion for 16,000 steel helmets, 5,000 - 10,000 rifles (Pattern 14) with 1,000 rounds per rifle, and for 3 inch Stokes trench mortars with 10,000 rounds per gun. Captain Ball told me that the position of his Company would be easier if the Nepalese, when buying SRjsununitions in this country, would first approach some Government Department who would be able to hand them over either to the Soley Armament Company or, if the latter have not got in stock the materials required, to some other company. He suggested either the Crown Agents for the Colonies or the Contracts Department at the Y/ar Office. I told him that we would consider this request and send him a reply through the D.M.I. or the Contracts Branch at the War Office. He asked that we should not write to him in regard to the matter. He told me incidentally that the Nepalese are making enquiries on the Continent for Mausers and .303 rifles.■■■Mi ■■Mi ■Ml MMMM ■—1~ ^-^■■mmmmmmhmmHHII v\ jvVj a A No. 35/24(22).

The question of tiie right of the Nepal Durhar to purchase ana import munitions of war into the state has recently come under consideration. In 1893 Lord Lansdowne permitted the Durhar to purchase and import war material, subject to the condition that the uemanas made should he reasonable. In 1894 Lord iSlgin again pointed out that there must necessarily he a limit which it was for the Government of India to prescribe In respect to such importations ana purchases. Under Lord Elgin’s | instructions, it was also pointed out to the prime Minister that the possession by the Durbar of machinery for the manufacture of arms ana ammunition would obviously render impossible any limitation of the extent to which Nepal mighl arm without the knowledge of the Government of India. 22. In 1902 it was brought to notice that the Durbar still maintained two arsenals for the manufacture, not only of rifles and cartridges, but of guns. Lord Curzon informed the Durbar that he was in complete accord with the view taken by Lord Elgin, and pointed out that the chief object of the permission given by Lord Lansdowne for the importation of arms was to ensure that in future all transactions connected with such import should be conducted by the Durbar in a perfectly' open manner, ana that they should no longer have any ground either for manufacturing arms or ammunition or for importing the material/material far their manufacture in a surreptitious manner. His Excellency stated that it was evident that, if the question of arms for Nepal was to he dealt with hy the two Governments in a perfectly frank, ana open manner, it ms essential that the confidence shown hy the Government of India in tne good faith of the Durbar should he reciprocated, and that the Durbar should scrupulously regard the implied conditions on which the permission to import had been given. 23. The minister in reply expressea his surprise at learning that tne Government of India, in granting the concession for tne purchase of war material by the Durbar haa done so with tne object of ensuring that tne Durbar should have no ground for manufacturing war material in their arsenals.in a surreptitious manner. He states that the outturn of the one arsenal which was working was poor in quality and inadequate to the needs of the country, and pointed out that it was essential that nis Government shoula possess a reasonably efficient army, having regard both to the wila ana unruly character of many of the tribe which inhabit Nepal and to tne danger of attack from tne Tibetan side. He stated, however, that he would be perfectly satisfied with tne purchase of any supplies that His Excellency the Viceroy might deem it reasonable for Nepal to possess. The Government of Inaia replied that, while they were glad to receive the assurances of tne minister, they were unable to share his apprehensions as to the possibility of hostile movements on the part of Tibet of so serious a nature as to necessitate any marked increase to the military resources and armament of Nepal. They expressed their willingness, as in the past, to comply with each requisition for additional arms as might appear to be reasonable/r - 3 - reasonable, and relied upon the Durbar to keep them fully informed of any arrangements that might be made for the manufacture of arms and ammunition within Nepal territory. In July 1905, the Durbar again reopened the question of the manufacture of warlike material in the State by submitting a request to be allowed to improve tneir machinery by purchasing various articles which were required in order to render it efficient. At the same time they asked to be allowed to purchase from the Government of India 1,300,000 rounds of fart in i- Henry ammunition yearly, in order to put their troops through a course of practice, and 2,500 rounds of Lee- Metford ammunition for the purpose of training the Prime Minister's body guard in the use of 25 Lee-lletford rifles which had been presented to the Durbar by the Government of India in 1904. The Resident was directed to inform the Durbar that the Government of India were pleased to sanction their request to be allowed to purchase ammunition from Government, but were unable to permit them to purchase the articles required for tne improvement of their machinery. It was explained to the Durbar that nothing had occurred since the year 1902 which would warrant a change in the attitude of the Government of India towards the question of the manufacture of munitions of war in Nepal, while, on the other hand, the march of events in Tibet, since that year, would necessarily have relieved the Durbar from the apprehensions felt by them of attack from the North. Attention was also drawn to the fact that the safety of the Nepal State from foreign foes was assured by the friendship of the British Government, which had been strengthened and confirmed by tne friendly attitude adopted by the Prime Minister during the Mission to Lhasa.2 5 OCT W34 From •i n r&lt; &gt; o&gt;'- To The Deputy Secretary to*the GoTemaent oi India t* * t lh and Political Department# His Majesty r s Savoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of jblepal.

As a result, His Highness has asked me to enquire if it is possible to supply the Nepal Government v»ith their requirement of 217800 Martini Henry cartridges for this year from the stocks 7#hich may still be on charge of arsenals in India and whether an approximately similar number can be supplied to them for the next few years until such time as the Nepal Government can make their own arrangements for the manufacture of Martini Henry ammunition. £ £ S S3 ~ ^ despatened to Allahabaa Arsenal on the Dtli July 1934 and I have £ * ^ ^ £ &lt;5 ^ • f 4 k ^ His Highness intimates that 21 7800 empty cartridge cases ? i 7 sent the necessary indent to Hie Chief ordnance Officer for the supply of an equivalent number of ball Martini Henry cartridges.

Direct dealings by the Nepal Government with firms in England for the supply of armaments generally is encouraged by our foreign Department as they do not want to supply arms from Government factories. In this connection please see -Foreign and Political D/0 No.278-X/30 of the 27th august, 1931. The Foreign Secretary has noted on this let ter:- 'We should prefer the Nepal Government to obtain arms and ammunition direct from firms in England, and have no objection to those firms receiving advice and technical assistance from the Departments of H.M.G. So far as we are concerned there is nothing in the O.C.O's suggestion that it would have been preferable for the request to have been made officially by the Nepalese Government through the Government of India. The point is perhaps worth calling attention to when a reply is sent to the India Office. Provided that the India Office keep us informed, as they have done in this case, of all such requests in order to enable us to check any re-armament which the Nepalese Government have in contemplation, nothing more seems to be required.'Tel.

This official request from Mr. Keymer, the agent in London of the Govt, of Nepal, arises out of earlier d.o.correspondence^as the result of which Major Drummond, the Assistant to the Ordnance Consulting Officefhere, called on Mr. Keymer and discussed with him the questions on v/hich he wishes to obtain the advice of the Woolwich Arsenal aithorities. Major Drummond^ visit was arranged in consultation with the Military Department who ordinarily deal with questions of the vto* supply of arms^from this country to Nepal. Major Drummond reported the conversation which he had with Mr. Keymer^and it was at first thought desirable to obtain from the Government of Nepal a formal request for these facilities through the Government of India; but Mr. Keymer represented that this would take some time to obtain and that he had now received practically complete statements of the Nepal Government 's requirements and the delay involved in reference back to them might involve that Government in increased costs owing to the hardening of prices in the meantime. It was therefore informally ascertained from the appropriate department of the War Office that y on receipt of an official request supported by this Office / the Army Council would probably be prepared to authorise the grant of the facilities desired. It is accordingly proposed to act on the official request now put forward by Mr. Keymer and to support the suggootien by reference to the political advantage to begained by affording assistance to Nepal^ with whom the Govt, of India are in particularly close and friendly relations. It is to be stipulated that no responsibility/ 2119 5000 8.33responsibility will be incurred by the War Office authorities in respect of the advice which may be given by Woolwich Arsenal and that no expense will fall on public funds.

It will be seen that Mr. Keymer enquires whether the assistance and advice of the authorities at Woolwich Arsenal could be made available to him in regard to technical matters arising from the specifications and tenders of manufacturing firms with whom he is in negotiation^and I am to ask whether the Army Council will be prepared to accord the facilities for which he asks on the understanding that no responsibility would be undertaken in respect of any advice given^and that no expense would fflll upon public funds. Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare supports . Keymer'e request on the ground of the political advantage to be gained by affording assistance to the Government of a State with which the Govt, of India are in close and friendly relations in a matter to which His Highness the Maharaja is/ 2262 5000 11.33is said to be giving his personal attention. Sir Samuel Hoare understands that the question has already been informally discussed with officers of your Department to whom the nature of the assistance desired by Mr. Keymer has been explained by the Assistant to the Ordnance Consulting Officer of this Office. He accordingly trusts that the Council will be able to authorise the grant of the facilities desired at an early date.
