Dear Lalthwaite, a fieference your letter P.Z.4264/34 of the 3rd instant. !• Air Ministry is prepared to agree to the installation of stronger poles at an additional cost of Ms.440. 2. With regard to maintenance we consider th t Kg. l50 oer annum is a fair charge, but we are rather surjjrised by the suggestion that the material should become the property of the local government. X am, moreover, not quite certain •whether that condition is to apply immediately or only in the event of the aerodrome being abandoned and the line no longer required by us. If it is intended that application should be immediately, we could only agree on the distinct understanding that the line is used solely for / ir Ministry purposes# ♦ 3. We should be grateful if you y/ould offer the following alternatives to the Bahrein Government: (a) The Air Ministry to pay Ks.150 per annum, the line being taken over at a valuation when no longer needed by us. (by fhe line to bejhanded over (when no longer required) gratis, in exchange for free maintenance. (I might add that the chances of the aerodrome ever being abandoned are remote.) 4. In order to avoid delay, could you cable our acceptance of the stronger poles, asking at the same time if work can proceed pending discussion of the maintenance question? 5. As soon as these matters are settled, an official confirmatory letter will be sent to the India Office. Tours sincerely, (SD. ) V.A.DimCAN.

In tnls connection I understand that the Bahrain Government are prepared to give a priority claim for calls to and from the handing ground over this portion of the line. 3; would be grateful of an assurance on this point. \ 4.

It is considered to be most desirable that the material and equipment necessary for the extension of the existing telephone system to the landing ground at Maharaq is to be the property of the Bahrain Government immediately upon its installation; and consequently the suggestions in your paragraph 2. Clauses (a) and (b) are not acceptable. 3. In view of the extension being the property of the Bahrain Government and being a part of the existing telephone system, it appears proper that the responsibility for its maintenance should be undertaken by the Bahrain His Britannic Majesty r s Political Agent Bahrain. Sir, Government —- 2 - Government, The Bahrain Government would maintain its own property. it should be explained that the is, the right of obtaining communication upon the whole telephone system)^ and not for service and maintenance. Therefore 1 submit that the sugges tion in your paragraph 3, Clause (1) does not arise. lished at Maharaq, the extension will become part of the public line between Manamah and Maharaq and will be available for public service. Since such service may be regarded as of Public Utility, as an act of grace the Bahrain Government is prepared to give priority service on all calls to and from the Landing Ground over this line. 5. On the understanding that payment for the accepted tender will not be unreasonably delayed, the clause (b) of your paragraph 5 is answered in the affirmative. 6. I would add that on account of the importance of this arrangement, and of the fact that the writer is only temporarily acting for the Adviser, who is in London and likely to be in touch with the Air Ministry, I am sending a copy of this correspondence to him; and I trust that it is admissible in the Adviser to vary the above, should he think fit. charge of Rs 150/- prepayable is for service (that 4. in the event of an exchange being estab 1 have the honour to be, Sir,C\0 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, V /}• K ^ r I 1 rus is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated,-on receipt^ with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

If the Govern ment of Bahrain take over the tine entirely they will pay for all replacements which &amp;&amp;y be necessary. 6. I do not think it advisable that the extension should be mede direct from the tireless Station to the Landing Ground as this will entail much extra expense and a certain au»unt of inconvenience should anyone other than those at the Mreless Btetion wish to comunicate with the Landing Ground. 7.
