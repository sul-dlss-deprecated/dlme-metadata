An exchange of correspondence in 1932 between the Political Agent at Bahrain (Captain Charles Geoffrey Prior) and the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) refers to the question of authority for the issue of certificates for animal casings in Bahrain (ff 4-5). The remainder of the file is comprised of copies of certificates, all bar one of which are entitled ‘Foreign Official Certificate for Animal Casings’. The certificates detail packages of sheep casings exported to The Standard Casing Company Incorporated of New York, and are signed and stamped by the Political Agent and Manama Municipality. The remaining certificate refers to the physical health and lack of evidence of disease in three white Bahrain monkeys (f 8).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>The Standard Casing Company, Inc, New York</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Manamah Municipality</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Animal diseases</topic></subject><subject><topic>Animal products</topic></subject><subject><topic>Certificates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000114#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
