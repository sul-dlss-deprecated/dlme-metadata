It reports that the tribe is comfortable, prosperous, and that the Imam has agreed to ensure that the money granted to the tribe by the Bombay Government is spent repairing their habitations.It further reports that the Imam has been reassured that the British are solely motivated by a desire to raise the tribe out of 'extremity of want and misery', which it is noted that the British were instrumental in reducing them to. It also mentions that a private discussion with Mohomed been Ally [Muḥammad bin ‘Alī], Chief of the Beni Boo Ali, revealed no recent cause for complaint against the Imam, and that in future the tribe will look to him for protection.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x00007e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
