A further cause of insecurity relating to this is referred to in a note (ff 335-336) by the 2nd Assistant Resident, Bushire, J S Crosthwaite, who describes how tribesmen had invested their money in rifles and could only earn their living by robbing the caravans of commercial travellers.Correspondence discusses how this culminated in an attack upon J H Bill, Acting British Consul, Shiraz, in which two horsemen or '
                           sowars' were killed, as he travelled along a caravan route. Correspondence discusses measures to be taken as a result of this attack, including a claim for compensation from the Persian Government, a punitive expedition against the Kashgais tribe and the role of Soulet et-Dowle, Governor General, Fars. Measures discussed include using the guards (
                           gholam) of the Indo-European Telegraph Department paid for by a surcharge on customs duty levied by the British at Bushire; implications for relations with the Persian Government and the Russian Government are also discussed.Included in the volume is a 'Memorandum respecting the Disorders on the Trade Routes of Southern Persia' by H G Trick, Vice-Consul for Fars.The principal correspondents in the volume include Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Viscount Morley of Blackburn, Secretary of State for India; Percy Zachariah Cox, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and Sir George Head Barclay, Minister at Tehran.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Governor-General of Fars Province</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Boir Ahmadi (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Shiraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kazerun</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Highway robbery</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000038#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000038#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000038#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
