As regard^ privlle&amp;Q leave, Mr Belgrave points out that he h s no connections with India lc would be unlikely to wish to spend his leave there lc in any case it would not be worth while to proceed to India on les^ thrn three months accumulated privilege leave. He anticipates that he would probably elettto take privilege leave about e-'ery two years It might wish to ^o to S^ria or if travelling facilities improve might elect to go home at his own expense,Hewould txierefore be glad it the condition might be Liade to read as follows.

British xiesidency and Consulate-General, X Bushire, th June 1926. ^ Q]* Sir, ■ I am directed to refer to your memorandum uo. 56/5/20, dated the 2nd may 1926, regarding the form of agreement for the Adviser, Bahrain State# 2. It is regretted that through inadvertance the initial rate of pay was set out as Es 1000-0-0 plus is 200-0-0 per mensem. This has now heen corrected. As the Government of India have sanctioned the rate of Es 800-0-0 plus Rs 200-0-0 per mensem, the Hon'ble the political Resident regrets that it cannot be alter ed now, 3, It has been noticed that the clause regarding notice was omitted. The necessary audition has been made. 4. Your proposed addition in para 5 (a)(Furloughj has been approved, and is now incorporated in the agreement, 5. Colonel Irideaux regrets that he cannot permit Mr. Belgrave to accumulate his privilege leave to the extent sug- t gested by you. The intention underlying the grant of one month's leave each year was that the officer should retain his . health by taking leave each year to ensure his getting a change of air and climate. The Political Resident is, however, pre - pared to allow Mr. Belgrave to accumulate such leave up to two months, to enable him to spend it in the Lebanons, if he so wishes, he cannot agree to it being taken with furlough, and wished me to point out that this is contrary to the Indian leave rules, for,' when leave on average pay was introduced, privilege leave was abolished. 6. There is no objection to the word 'average' being substi tuted The Political Agent, Bahrain,2 a substituted for 'personal'. 7. It is regretted that the period of the agreement cannot be increased. There is no reason why a fresh agree - nent should not be executed on termination of an expired one, provided that the parties agree and the Government of India approve• The second or later agreement may be on ^he same lines as or different from, the first or previous agreement, but it may be assumed that the terms as regards passage conces- Bions will 'be B-lmilar to those granted to gazetted officers of the Political -uexjartment. 8. Free medical attendance cannot be given as a matter of right to any officer's family, as it is not part of the v/ork for which medical officers are paid, if the medical officer is an officer of the Government of India it is hoped that he will not exercise his right of demanding remuneration for such work, while he treats the family of the Political ^gent free. 9. The draft agreement, as revised, is enclosed. Action may now, please, be taken as in para.2 of my memorandum Ko. - 155-S, datea the 20th April 1926.

With reference to -espondence ending with this Residency endorsement No. 420-3., dated the 6th November 1925, a copy of a draft agreement for employment of Mr. Belgrave by the Bahrain State is forwarded herewith. 2. The Eon'ble the Political 'Resident wishes you to show this to Shaikh Hamad, and if he agrees and I.r. Belgrave has no objection, the agreement may be executed, and counter- -signed by you, and two copies forwarded to this office. 3. It has not been considered necessary to insert a clause forbidding Mr. Belgrave to engage in trade, but you should inform him (and report accordingly) that of course this will not be allowed. 4. Mention has been made of passage concessions for Mr. Belgrave and his family. It is considered desirable not to fix a definite sum of money in lieu of the actual cost of the tickets, as there would seem to be a balance of advantage against so doing, and it is not the practice in India at present 5. The Political Resident considers that, if Mr. Belgraw has to submit any monetary claim against the State, e.g. for passage allowance, it will be desirable for him to first obtain? the Political. Agent's counter-signature to the claim before presentation* to the State for payment. By order. Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.■ f • ! 7 r 'I 1 *' a Ho.301-S of 1926.

Sir, With reference to my reoent conversation with you on the subject of paragraph V(a) dealing with furlough, in my contract of service with the Bahrain State, I have the honour to request that you will kindly submit the following application to the Hon'ble the Political Kesident, Persian Gulf. The section states 'Furlough shall only be taken in the first instance after four years of service' At the time that the contract was made, I had no experience of the climate in summer time, or the exacting nature of the work, I was told that the contract was framed on similar lines to that of a person joining the Indian Political Service for the first time, Conditions of service in the Bahrain State differ very considerably to the Indian Political Department, There is no possibility of being transferred to a different climate; a hill- station cannot be reached under ten days, and travelling in the Perisan Gulf during the hot season is climatically no change. The fouryears' clause was inserted with the object of ensuring a thorough knowledge o- the /or 1 : before taking leave.page -2- Prior to my service in Bahrain, I had spent about years in the near _.ast, and two years in Africa, doing /ork of a similar nature to this, atleast hall of the time, therefore I was not altogether unacquainted /ith work of this type. The value of work of this description depends largely on continuity and length of service, this, in my opinion, can only be assured by good health. I submit that if is impossible to work to the best 01 ones ability for four years under the conditions prevailing in this place, and that it would be of ultimate benefit to'the State if the conditions of furlough could be modified, I reouest that the condition of four years service prior to furlough should be reduced to two years, after which three months furlough on full pay, in England, may be t aken, and also that the passage money for the one month per year annual leave to India, may, if not spent on'that purpose, be utilised towards the furlough after the two years, The second term of service would then commence after the return to Bahrain from furlough, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser to the Government, Bahrain,No. D. )/8/rl.

With reference to your confidential memorandum No G/99 of 1927 dated 7th September. I Leg t') inform you that H.E. Shaikh Hamed would have no objection tomthe payment by the State of an additional Rs 30/- per month to the Medical Officer. Shaikh Hamed has a very high opinion of Doctor Holmes' abilities and greatly appreciates his work in Bahrain. At the same time 1 would point out that at the end of 1344 Shaikh hamed, after consultation with .ilajor Daly, and myself, raised the salary which is paid to Dr Holmes by the state from Rs 100/- to Rs 250/- per month, which is the sum that he now receives. The suggestion originated from Major Daly and the additional amount was intended to cover the extra work which would accrue from 1 * at tending the European officials of the State. The above salary is quite apart from the Rs 150/-, quarantiA*, allowance which is also paid from state funds. I am sure it will be understood that I have no wish to belittle the value of Doctor holmes' services but I think perha J the authorities are not aware of the increase in pay to which I have refered.

The pay of Mr.Belgrave is approximately Rs.lOO/- p.m in excess of that of Captain Parke. There is at present no intention of remunerating Mr. Belgrave for carrying en the duties of an appointment of inferior status to his own. He was not paid any allow- ancs for performing the duties of Mr.Lewis do Grenier during that gentloman^s absenct on leaye in 1927. Siieikh Hamad is however of such a generous naturo that it is quite probable that he may, at some futuro date consider it desirable te give Mr.Belgrave some extra allowance. 1 recommend that the question be allowed te rest for the present.
