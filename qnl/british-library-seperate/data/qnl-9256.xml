The file contains a large amount of correspondence from representatives of BAPCO.The papers include: British Government approval for the preferred option of the Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah [Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah], to give the whole of the Unallotted Area to BAPCO rather than dividing it between BAPCO and Petroleum Concessions Limited (PCL), 1939; drafts and signed copies of (1) the political agreement relating to the Bahrain oil concessions between HM Government and BAPCO, and (2) the agreement between the Ruler of Bahrain and BAPCO supplementing BAPCO's original lease, 1939-40; comments on the drafts of the agreements and the progress of negotiations by the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; comments on the drafts of the agreements by the Foreign Office, Petroleum Department, and the Admiralty (including the issue of territorial waters); correspondence and agreement concerning the temporary transfer of BAPCO geological plans and other records out of Bahrain as a result of wartime conditions, 1941; correspondence concerning an agreed moratorium on all operations by BAPCO in the Additional (previously Unallotted) Area as a result of wartime conditions, 1941-43; correspondence concerning the probable length of life of the Bahrain oilfield, 1946; and papers concerning the resumption of full operations by the Company, 1946-47, including a four-year extension to the BAPCO lease as a result of the moratorium.The Arabic language content of the papers consists of drafts and signed copies of the oil agreement in both English and Arabic, and correspondence between British officials and the Ruler of Bahrain, with English translations.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a7#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a7#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
