The scene could not have made a more explicit contrast to the grey figures huddling in the rain on the Southampton quay-side barely two weeks before I had arrived in the East, and I liked it.

The alternating rhythm of home, boarding school, home, three terms at a military academy - 3 S cT°K f ext ® ns . 10n of school - and a short spell with a battery on Salisbury Plain had done nothing to prepare one for this. No wonder I thought, that the troops had not been allowed ashore' The only escape was into a sleazy bar, where unaccustomed quantities of whisky were drunk, until it was time to return on board, and where the shocking discovery was made that some of one s brother officers (and from quite good schools too!) were prepared to sample the wares we had so recently been offered. A pity, aspect rece i ve of Port British on to the who 1e, the open that a country should parade its sleaziest mind of the first-time visitor eager to his first impressions, but not to forget Said had been affected by the thousands and Commonwealth troops who had and after the first World War. passed that the mores of sex-starved through it during When the four of us reached our shared cabin, the two senior subalterns were somewhat affected by the quantity - and possibly the quality - of their potations on shore, and decided to beat up . e , ourth » to whose appearance and manner they had taken a dislike, and whom they knew as the 'Queen of Sheba.' For this purpose they proposed to use a lead-loaded rubber truncheon which they had unwisely bought. It was a potentially lethal weapon and in the ensuing confusion I was able to conceal it under my pillow. Hence the uncomfortable lump.

Although H.M. Troopship 'Devonshire' was no cruise liner it was comfortable enough, drink was cheap, and military duti’es were confined to periodic inspections of the troop-decks, which merely served to emphasise the comparative comfort of the officers' accommodation.

They appeared to have no ambition beyond becoming part of a British unit and a British society temporarily exiled to India; whereas I wanted to get as close as possible to the Indian scene, and the first essential for this was to have some command of an Indian language. It was difficult to make progress without hearing the language spoken and I had been outstandingly inept at classical languages while a't school howevec I discovered later that the Urdu spoken by upwards of 90% of the British officers in India was in fact a language almost he't^ 6 hr 9 !! 6 untutored Indian!

Below them were the Vaisyas who were merchants and traders, and finally the Sudras who did the dirty work. All these, of course, were divided into numerous sub-castes If a Brahmin was cooking his food and an untouchable passed by so close that his shadow fell on it, the Brahmin had to throw away his meal and start again. The Maharajah of Alwar, a Rajput would not even shake hands with a European - an untouchable Eater \ ~ wlthout wearing a glove. But this same Maharajah's predilection was sodomy and I very much doubt whether he was so particular about the caste of his catamites - I certainly ^!ic Ve K eC \ mUCh , V ter that hi 9 h -c a ste Rajput princes made no bones about copulating with an untouchable girl provided she was sufficiently attractive! In fact, even though enshrined in religion, the ancient Hindu Caste system is no more effective than modern apartheid. Finally early one morning, I was glad to be able to hand over my at Faizabad Station in the United Provinces and head West again to Ambala where the battery to which I had been posted was stationed. I!;- 5 ° n1 * i' ears ,ater that ° n e came to appreciate the extent to which the Mutiny still affected the thinking of the rulers of the country in which one was going to live, and of the army in which one was going to serve. We were all gunners but, except for the Mountain artillery (nearly all stationed on the frontier) there had been no Indian gunners in the Indian Army since the Mutiny It was felt to be safer that there should be only white fingers on the triggers. Apart from the Gurkhas, Indian Army regiments were as a rule of mixed races - a company of Sikhs, one of Panjabi Mussulmans, another of Dogras or Garhwalis and so forth. Lingering mistrust of the armed Indian also meant that the races from which we had recruited before the Mutiny were largely cast into outer darkness and men of the North or North-West taken in10 CHAPTER 2 Screw Gunner 'For you all love the screw-guns - the screw-guns they all love you .' - Kipiino I was met on Ambala railway station by a diminutive man with a quizzical manner who turned out to be Wilf Wall, the senior subaltern of the battery, and I got an inkling of the principles on which the army worked when he told me in the tonga* on the way to the Mess 'You will be the Education officer and the Sports officer - oh yes, and the Mess Secretary!' All chores whichideally should be shared amongst the subalterns, but in practice were shuffled off onto the shoulders of the juniormost. I was joining a light battery in Camp at Ambala on the North Punjab plain half way between Delhi and Simla. It had been a much bigger station, but shortage of water had led to the garrison being much reduced and the cantonment presented a neglected and dilapidated air. As our permanent station was Jutogh, about 3 miles from Simla, and we were merely in winter camp at Ambala, the officers were accommodated in tents in the garden of the Gunner Mess. But the tents were palatial, with beds, tables, chairs and carpets, and an adjoining bathroom tent with tin hip-bath and basin. The soldiers were housed in some of the old barrack blocks and were as comfortable as they would have been allowed to be anywhere in India. We were a Light Battery consisting of six 3.7' howitzers in three sections, each commanded by a subaltern; over them was a captain and second-in-command whose duties were administrative, and in over-all command was a major, who in my experience spent his time agonising over whether he was going to be promoted to colonel. On this depended whether he would retire in penury or in relative affluence. No such anxieties plagued the more junior officers : promotion came automatically, albeit slowly, and subject to passing promotion examinations. One expected to spend 13 years or so as a subaltern in the nineteen thirties - I think the record at the t i me was fifteen. Our guns could be taken apart by unscrewing the barrel in the middle and each loaded on 8 mules and this was the normal way of moving them. As the loads were heavy the mules had to be big and as the mules were big - many from South Africa or the Argentine - the gunners had to be tall and strong, and in a Light Battery were all British. The drivers on the other hand, whose job it was to lead and manage the mules, were Indians. In the Mountain Batteries, with one of which I later served, the guns were * Hideously uncomfortable two-wheeled trap drawn by a pony in which the driver and passenger sit back-to-back.11 identical but the gunners as well as the drivers were Indian. Our duties were light, but off duty there was plenty to do : we were expected to play games with the troops - football with the British gunners and hockey with the Indians. This was of a high standard, being played on very fast grounds of hard-beaten mud. But I soon discovered a more congenial occupation when I found that large flocks of blue rock pigeons flighted in every evening to roost on the walls of the local jail. On holidays (Thursdays as well as Saturdays and Sundays were always a holiday) one could take a rifle and bicycle into the surrounding flat country and stalk the numerous blackbuck which grazed unmolested in the fields. The caste, character, and credibility of one's bearer, or personal body servant, was a matter of considerable importance because almost all one's contacts with other servants were conducted through him. It was considered amongst the Indian army regiments (and the Mountain Artillery) unthinkable to have a bearer who could speak English, for such were usually of low-caste and had learned their trade (and the language) working for the British troops in barracks. They were thus held in very little respect by the Indian soldiers and others with whom they came in contact. Years later in Iraq (where, of course, the same rules and caste-system do not apply), I had a Kurdish driver whose knowledge of English had been picked up in the barracks and whom I passed on to the British Ambassador on my departure. I often wonder what the ambassador's lady thought when she asked him a question to which he didn’t know the answer, for he could only have replied 'Fucked if I know'. But I was extraordinarily lucky in inheriting from my predecessor one Sher Oil (Lionheart), a suitably bearded and turbanned Muslim from the mountains of North West India. He was, in fact, from Poonch which lies between the Pashtu-speaking areas of the frontier and Kashmir, and was thus looked down upon by the Pathans to the same extent as he despised the Kashmiris and the other innumerable millions of the inhabitants of the Indian sub-continen t. He served me well for very many years in conditions of hardship and danger which might have proved too much for others 'of the wrong sort'. Years later I was staying with a cousin who was the General Commanding in Peshawar and, being of the British service, had the wrong sort of bearer, when after Sunday lunch an earthquake occurred. A flash of white passed through the drawing-room - which was the general's servant escaping - and then the door was held open by Sher Oil who said in Urdu 'It would be advisable to come outside. Sir. There is an earthquake.'12 Why did I choose a Light Battery in India? India for sport : I left my golf clubs behind when I left England because I reckoned that if I couldn't find something better to do in India than play golf it wasn't the country I thought it was : and I never regretted the decision. The choice of a Light Battery was because of money. In the Army of 1932 it was only possible to fight one's corner in the Guards, the Cavalry or the Royal Horse Artillery if one had a respectable private income. (After all less than a hundred years before those who could afford it had equipped and paid their regiments out of their own pockets and bought their promotion.) In the Field Artillery it was rather touch-and-go. The pay was enough to live on but not enough to finance hunters and polo-ponies which, though not de rigeur would certainly enhance a subaltern's status and speed of promotion. So the Field Artillery was just beyond my father's means. (He had, after all, three more children at private schools - or public schools if you prefer it - and only his pension as a Colonel and his salary as a don at Oxford to pay the fees.) The Royal Engineers and the Signals were Corps in whch one could live on one’s pay so the competition for places was intense. In spite of my father's urging I failed to secure one and I have a guilty feeling that it may have had something to do with the fact that I didn't really want one. There was nothing wrong with either Corps - their officers could and did rise to the heights - but - God forgive me! - I found them somewhat ' unq1 amorous'! After the first World War the Horse, Field and Garrison Artillery were amalgamated and officers from the last given occasional postings to Mountain Artillery to give them a taste of the joys of mobility. There was, of course, the P.B.I. (acronym for the Poor Bloody Infantry) in some of the less pretentious regiments of which it was theoretically possible to live on one's pay; but the icing on the cake of life was thin. However utter boredom and sheer desperation drove some of these officers to the study of their profession, with the result that in later years they became that most unloved of God's creation - British Generals. Social life was strange. There was almost no social mixing with Indians of any stratum and contacts with other British was regulated by strict but out-dated etiquette. One came out with a supply of correctly engraved visiting cards which one had to insert in little boxes marked 'not at home' hanging on the gateposts of brother officers - one for a bachelor and two for a married couple. An invitation to luncheon or dinner followed and one was then known to them. There were regular Guest Nights at the mess; when formal dress was worn and an elaborate dinner and much drink was consumed, followed by cards, a sing-song, and finally boisterous and extremely exhausting games which usually involved somersaulting over the furniture and cock-fighting on the floor. 'Other ranks', of course, were not involved and their amusements were even more earthy.13 It fell to my lot not many weeks later to conduct the Christmas Day Church Parade, when I had to march a squad of twenty or so troops fully armed (because of an incident a few years before when an un-armed church Parade had been attacked) to the garrison church. I was puzzled, in my innocence, by the fusillade of hiccoughs from the ranks behind me and only later realised that all the men were more or less drunk, although it was still quite early in the morning. However I returned them all to barracks and gave them the order to fall out, when Gunner Malone, from Ireland, asked to speak to me. 'I have a complaint. Sir,' he said, 'It's the Padre, I distinctly saw him cross himself.' I suppose it was his way of making it clear to me that he was of the Protestant persuasion, and therefore on the same side. Later, the officers had to visit the married sergeants in their quarters, being plied at each call with a lethal dose of miscellaneous mixtures of alcohol, and finish up at the soldiers Christmas dinner, where we were expected to prove our manhood by consuming vast quantities of even more virulent mixtures. Altogether an ordeal by alcohol. When we had recovered from this horrible orgy, we proceeded with our winter training, culminating in manoeuvres near Delhi. My chief recollections are of a spectacular ball at the Viceroy's house, where amongst the hundreds of guests there were a large number of Indian Princes in their State attire loaded with jewels; and an occasion when I rode out alone exercising a young horse before our first parade, which was at 6:30 a.m. In the dim light of dawn I rode up to a circle of men robed in white and squatting round a hole in the ground on the outskirts of a village. From the way they looked up I suspected that they were involved in something that they would rather was not observed by an outsider and I rode on. Then I remembered that one of them had been holding a small bundle wrapped in white cloth and realised what I had happened to see. Female children are unwanted in the lower castes of Hindu society. A female cannot be found a husband when she grows up unless her father can provide her with a dowry and meet the vast expense of a wedding ceremony; so the easiest solution is to smear opium on the mother's nipple and - when the baby has ingested it - to quietly bury the anaesthetised infant. It was, I suppose, my duty to report it to the nearest police station, but then I could not identify the men, nor, exactly, the place; and, in the last resort, what right had I or the British authorities to interfere with the age-old practices of the inhabitants? I rode on, reflecting on the fact that this was their way of restricting the growth of their population beyond the available food supply. I have no doubt that the practice continues today, and have urged on drug companies the desirability and commercial advantages of producing a pill to inhibit the birth of femaleCHAPTER 3 Getting Horsed and Getting to the Heights In April I took a train to Saharanpur in the United Provinces and chose myself a half-broken 4 year-old 'Waler' (an Australian- bred horse from New South Wales) from the Remount Depot there. I schooled him to show-jump and play polo, and although he was a bold and willing jumper, he also shone on the polo-field and he sold five years later for Rs2,100 having been bought with an interest-free loan from the Army of Rs400 ! Officers in those days were expected to buy their own chargers and were welcome to turn an honest penny on them if they could. Later I was lucky enough to be given an imported English thoroughbred sired by the Derby-winner Felstead. He also became an excellent polo- pony although he measured 16 hands. He had been given by the trainer who imported him to a brother subaltern, Hugh O'Reilly, as - apart from falling off a railway bridge and suffering a dropped hip - he showed no ambition to go in front on the race-course When Hugh was posted to Chitral (where polo is played in small rocky fields surrounded by stone walls) he gave him to me on the same terms as those on which he had received him - that he would not race or sell the horse. So when I was posted to Persia 5 years later I had to give him away although he was by then a very valuable polo-pony. Finally, I accepted a present of a scarecrow-looking 'Waler' mare whose mouth had become too hard for her to be manoeuvrable on the polo field, and who moreover suffered from some disease of the digestion which made it very difficult to keep condition on her his could be controlled by careful feeding and, during the summer, I schooled her to show-jump so that she won the All-India Utticers Jumping Competition at the Imperial Delhi Horse Show the rollowing spring and was runner-up in the Open Jumping. When I finally gave her away, her new owner did not pay sufficient attention to her feeding and she died of colic However it gave me great pleasure to school, play and jump these horses and it was gratifying to feel that one was easily the best-mounted officer in the Brigade - and at negligible expense. batter y set off for its permanent station at Jutogh in the Simla Hills, about 3 miles from the summer capital. This involved a march due northwards of about 100 miles and an ascent hlf db °u l ! : „ 6 ’ 000 feet - Ambala was already dry, dusty and very hot Whatever grass there was was brown and the flowers in the gardens, except for the beds of canna lilies, burnt Even the nights were hot in spite of the whirling ceiling fans, and there was the al1-pervading feeling that there was worse, much worse to come. The place was settling down to a siege - a siege by heat with no prospect of relief until September. It was time to be going. T &lt; e &gt;.. fir u t m , arches were over the flat North Punjab plain and the mighty Himalayas ahead of us seemed to become hourly clearer. We started very early and the perpetual snows of the high mountains 15behind the darker tiers of foothills seemed to be beckoning us on. By early afternoon we would arrive at our campsite, unload our mules, and have some lunch. There were still some birds about which it was 1 eg i t i mat e to shoot for the pot, after the camp had been put into shape and the animals groomed. Amongst other useful knowledge (which I acquired from the Sergeant-Major) was that a camp-site should not be chosen near long grass or other cover. This was not because there was any danger of an attack, but in case some enterprising villager might use the long grass to conceal women who would lure the troops to amorous adventure and almost inevitable venereal disease. Indeed one couldn't help feeling sympathy for the soldiers in the sexual desert in which our prudery condemned them to live. (Only senior N.C.O.'s of many years service were allowed to have their wives with them in India) . In previous years, units had been permitted to maintain brothels under medical supervision for the relaxation of the men. But some officious Vicereine had put an end to this. I may mention, in passing, the story of the medical officer who, on examining a soldier, asked him if he had ever had V.D. before - to receive the reply 'I'm a martyr to it. Sir!' As we came to the first signs of the great plain ending in undulations, which could not yet be dignified with the name of hills, we passed close to an unprepossessing village with unsavoury tumble-down mud houses and an equally unsavoury reputation. This was Chandigarh, later to become the capital of the Panjab and to be transformed by the great architect Corbusier. Almost the next camp was Kalka, the rail-head of the broad-gauge Indian railway, and also of the narrow-gauge mountain railway up to Simla. From there on for some fifty miles, every step seemed to carry one an inch or two upwards, every hill was higher than the last and every valley deeper. The vegetation also changed, and the Northern slopes became green while the sun still allowed very little to grow on the Southern slopes. In a day or so we reached the Himalayan pines and then the Deodars and Rhododendrons and the sight of Simla on the saddle between higher cedar-clad mountains. The aspect of Simla from below was far from impressive - a huddle of tin-roofed shacks spilling down the hill-side - but when one reached the col and the inevitable Mall Road things were somewhat better. In contrast to the widely spaced single-storey mud bungalows of the plains, the two- or three-storey houses and shops were packed together, and much wood had been used in their construction. It was obvious that nostalgia for 'home' had inspired the builders to make them look as European as possible, and some looked reminiscent of Swiss chalets. Jutogh, when we reached it after a further hour's march, was charming. There was a small parade-ground, surrounded by unobtrusive single-storey barrack buildings set among trees, and looking down on it from across a little valley, the officers mess in its garden. The single officers lived on the upper floor 16for married o f f i cers^and ^ . ^0* ™ ^ h ° USeS in tt ’ eir own gardens PF''- '-f'''''f'tr'”.'a t r p “~v; r r d s , S; r .'.',%V'-, b Co-*.“ 6i ,; ' na ,a ,or ,Be (^''c'o.’do 0 / Hemp which they were sopposed’to dr ('nV-''a'no'' ’t,Tame f to ^tpam considering the nature of their occupation) to climb in order tn remove the 'welsh hats' and their contents from the commodes They were said to classify those they served as haziri - oahlis Kabhi r Kahhi b s r V kfaSterS) i' , Haz’ri-bads (after BVeak f as t er s ) Kabhi-K abhis (occasion a 1s) and Kabhi nahins (nevers).

My way out was to take to the study of Indian everv a9 a e ft W ’ th the h a' P ° f 3 teacher - ^0 would come ^for an hour StanrtarH ft F 00n ’ f • and • ,n 1933 1 l,lani, 9 ed to pass the Higher stand ard Examinations in both Urdu and Pashtu. ?nt J'° nt V nU ''J 1 - these studies, I subsequently added first class StanH^H d PS - in UrdU&gt; Persi ^ and Arabic, and a Higher Standard in Panjabi. Not only did this immensely increase the derived from one's life in the country in r a n j a o i . interest, and enjoyment, ,, but brought in cash rewards which 1 7 - • U M l I jr f were a not ineonsiderab1eaddition to one's pay (then about £330 per annum!) As Mess Secretary, I had to supervise the running of the mess and check the Khans amah's accounts, try to inspire him to introduce some variety into his menus, stop him producing goat and calling it mutton, and fine him when he tried to pass off milk thickened with flour as cream. For some reason I was also in charge of the gunners' messing and here I was able to bring off a minor coup. Their diet was intensely boring and there was never any fresh pork as the hill-mens' pigs were considered to be infested with tape-worm which, of course, can be passed on to whoever eats the flesh. But the sergeant cook was an Irishman and it pained him to have to throw away large quantites of swill from the cook-house. So a sty was contrived not too far way, and a number of piglets purchased. The medical officer was also an Irishman, and gave us warning of his inspections so that the pigs could be made to disappear into the surrounding verdure. At the end of the summer the battery feasted on roast pork and nobody suffered from tape-worms. My battery commander would not have approved but fortunately it never came to his ears! Iwas also able to make good (but illegal) use of my position as Education Officer. The men had to pass Education examinations for promotion, which became increasingly difficult with each rank. It so happened that I had in my section one Lance-Naik Bunay Singh, an excellent man looked up to by his comrades and always the first to volunteer for any particulary difficult or dangerous task, but unable to pass any examination (there was none f or Lance-Na i k) . He was quite unable, for instance to differentiate between Austria and Australia, but I felt that this was irrelevant to his worth as an N.C.O. in a Light Battery and accordingly included his name as one of those who had passed the next examination, although he had not sat for it, and was able to recommend him for promotion. Although the Indian soldiers were intensely competitive and jealous, there was not a single complaint. ^ Some years later, when I revisited the battery, my successor said to me, 'I have an excellent Naik, Bunay Singh, whom .1 am unable to promote to Havildar because he can't pass his Education exam -' 1 sai d 'He never passed the last one!' and I hope he took the message. Simla, unlike the average plains station, had also its social beguilements and one was able to dine and dance at Davico's or the Cecil Hotel once or twice a week. There were many senior Army Officers and civilians in Simla who commonly had their daughters and/or nieces staying with them, as it was unusual for a girl to look for paid work on leaving school. So there was a pool of charming girls in which to fish; but, surprisingly, my brother officers did not seem to have the appetite or initiative to indulge in this pleasant pastime.19 No cars were allowed in Simla apart from those belonging to the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief, and the Governor of the Punjab in whose province it was, and the only conveyances were rickshaws. I jibbed at being propelled by four sweating coolies for three up-hill miles and used to ride into Simla frequently, attired in white-tie and tail coat for evening parties, and return downhill in a rickshaw. Sher Oil , my bearer, was responsible for another diversion. A hill-man himself, he was a keen shikari and came to me with stories of an animal known as a Lukkur Bukkur which caused considerable distress to the hill vTI'l agers aFFund by killing their sheep and cattle. Nobody knew what the word meant and it wasn't in any dictionary, but I came to the conclusion that it could only be a panther. Accordingly, when next he brought word of a^ recent kill, I took my gun and set off down the Khad. The track was so steep that one could barely walk it withouT using one's hands and we must have descended more than a thousand feet but finally we reached a farm where they showed us the corpse of a cow. From the fact that the entrails had been eaten, I guessed that the killer was a leopard, and we built a hide of bushes on the ground (there were no trees) with a good view of the kill. I took my place in this just before sundown and Sher Oil and the villagers retreated. The task then was to remain absolutely still and not to make the slightest sound or movement. I thought I was doing pretty well, until about half an hour after dark I heard a sound of chewing and growling from the kill and also a loud sniffing and exhaling from just behind me. I didn't know quite what to make of this, but nevertheless switched on the torch and was confronted by several pairs of bright eyes shining from around the kill. I chose one pair and fired between them and the shot was followed by a crashing of undergrowth. When Sher Oil and the villagers arrived, we found that I had shot a half-grown leopard cub. Disappointing, but at least I had established that a Lukkur Bukkur was a leopard in the hill dialect. The sniffing aT the back of my neck had, of course, emanated from the mother of the cubs, and I felt it was fortunate that I had fired before she established my identity. I managed to shoot several more leopards that summer, much to the delight of the hill-men who could not afford to have their cattle preyed upon by these vermin, but rather to the annoyance of the Maharaja o Patiala, the land-owner, to whom I had applied for permission to shoot leopards within his domains. I duly received permission to shoot 'leopard', which I took to be intended as a plural. However it turned out that his secretary intended it to mean 'a leopard', there being no articles definite or indefinite in the Indian languages. There was only one occasion when things nearly went wrong. I was hidden about 5-6 yards from the kill - on this occasion a pony - facing west, and armed with an e1ephant-rif 1 e borrowed from Wi1f Wall. Shortly after sunset, while there was still a faint glow in the western sky, I thought I detected a movement and switched20 on my torch. There was a very large panther lying facing me about a yard away and staring intently into my hide! Of course, with the aid of the light behind him, he had detected me. I took careful aim between his eyes and pulled the trigger. There was only a loud click and he was off; I fired the second barrel after him without much hope of hitting him and I didn't. I then remembered that Wilf had warned me not to fire the right barrel because it didn't always work! I hadn't much hope that, after hearing the blast of my monstrous cannon at short range, he would come back next night, but he did. This time I had armed myself with a shot-gun and 'large game' shot, and the six heavy pellets hit him within a circle of 12 inches diameter round the heart, dropping him where he stood. The skins of 6 of these leopards made a fur coat for my sister valued at £3,000 before the inflation of the 1970s. It must be worth five figures now! Later that year, after we had marched down to Ambala, I answered an appeal from a near-by village and took a train to the nearest station, planning to catch the midnight train back to Ambala as the battery was leaving for practice camp in the morning. On this occasion we built a machan in a small tree overlookino the kill. For some reason I took a .280 rifle rather than the shot gun and trusty L.G shot, and when the leopard came on cue shot him in the approved spot behind the shoulder. The bullet, however, passed through the animal from above to below and, after thrashing about for a minute, he made off. The villagers all came rushing out at the shot, but disappeared very guickly when they heard there was a wounded leopard around! I knew that the correct thing to do on these occasions was to wait an hour or so to give time for the wound to stiffen and we did sit down and smoke for about 10 minutes; but then impatience began to irk us and we remembered the train we had to catch,and set off. We proceeded in close order at first, with myself in front and Sher Oil behind holding up a hurricane lantern. We followed the tracks along a dry nullah bed and then in to a branch only about a yard wide and four or five foot deep. Within a few hundred yards we came to a pool of blood where the leopard had lain down and the tracks ended. We started searching the surrounding bushes without result, and within a few minutes I was kicking bushes, carrying the rifle, and Sher Oil was some yards away with the lantern kicking other bushes. We found nothing, and shortly afterwards I had to leave to catch my train. Sher Oil begged to be allowed to stay behind and follow up the leopard in the morning, and very reluctantly I agreed, because to leave the leopard wounded might have meant death or injury to one of the villagers. In the morning Sher Oil accompanied by the village Shi k a r i went to the spot and were charged by the leopard from a bush within a few yards of the pool of blood. Mercifully they shot it, but this is not an episode of which I am proud.21 CHAPTER 4 Soldiering on In ^ th *. e ^ tumr l we loa ded up again and marched down the winding road to the plains; and it was surprising what a sense of relief and freedom it gave one to see flat land all round and to be able to travel for miles without climbing or descending a precipitous incline. Also the smells were different. That winter we entrained at Ambala and travelled several hundred miles south to Jhansi in the Central Provinces where we were to hold our bi-ennial 'practice camp'. This meant that we were to have the rare experience of firing real live shells from our The country was markedly different. Gone were the wide rich open plains of the Panjab : all was basically flat, but broken up by small hills and shallow nullahs, and mostly clothed in thorny scrub : and there were small patches of cultivation where water could be brought to the surface. Although the winter weather left nothing to be desired, the cantonment gave me the impression of having only just recovered from many months of blistering heat, and only briefly catching its breath before bracing itself to suffer it all over again. This was, indeed, the 'sloth belt', the name that Frontier officers gave to all of India east and south of Delhi -the implication being that only to the North-West could men remain vigorous and active. This was the furthest south that I was to serve in India, although, when one looks at the map of that vast country, it is undoubtedly North India. However there was plenty of game, and this more than made up for the splendid pageant of Delhi. After we had satisfied ourselves, almost to our surprise, that our guns could fire real shells and that we could direct them with varying accuracy onto their target, we entrained for Ambala and in due course took the road again for Simla. The summer took much the same course as the one before, except that I was due for two months local leave, which I spent in the delightful Hindu hill state of Chamba, some hundreds of miles to the North-West of Simla and on the borders of Ladakh and Zaskar It was inhabited by Hindus and Thibetans, but there was almost no contact between the religions, because the great Himalayan Range -with no passes under 20,000' - lay between them. One reached the little hill-station of Dalhousie by road, and there hired mules and walked along a well-graded but unmotorable track down the northside of the range to Kajiar. This was a charming glade in the cedar forest with a pleasant wood-built Hindu Temple. While we were camped there some locals came in22 with d report thdt d bldck bedr dnd two l6opdrds hdd been seen going into d edve in the vicinity, sndrling dnd fighting with edch other. This story was inherently improbable, but I thought it worth while to take my rifle and lie up where I had a good view of the entrance to the cave. As leopards do not normally move about in the open during daylight hours, I did not take up position until near sun-down, but I then heard from a man who had been watching that the animals had come out and made their way, still squabbling, round the spur into the next valley. There, as night fell, I could hear them snarling all around but saw nothing; and it was only then that I realised that there were three leopards in the vicinity, of which one must have been on heat, and one must have been black. I was mortified at having missed the only chance I ever had of shooting a black panther - a very rare trophy indeed. The next day we marched on down several thousand feet to Chamba - a pleasant little town, or large village, on the banks of a stream. There we took on a fresh team of mules and attendants and I met my professional Shikari who was, rather surprising1y, a hill Brahmin. From Chamba we marched some hundred miles due North by easy stages following a river valley and spending the nights in government rest-houses. I was intrigued to find that in one of them a previous occupant (presumably an Indian) had inscribed in the Complaints Book the terse comment 'Fles'. There was no way of knowing whether he meant fleas or flies but the point was immaterial as there were plenty of both! At the end of the hundred or so miles we reached a village where we said goodbye to the mules and hired porters for the climb over the 18,000' pass across the Pir Panjal ranqe. The next night we spent in a shepherd's stone hut at 15,000' and I experienced for the first time the very unpleasant sensation of mountain sickness. It was even worse next day when we crossed the snow-covered pass, but the view almost made up for it. Looking down over my shooting 'block', it seemed as if there was not so much as a square foot of level ground for hundreds of miles, and I wondered where we would find a spot on which to lie down and sleep. In the middle distance were the serried snowy peaks of the Great Himalayan Range, and in between a deep valley which marked the limit of my block. During the ensuing weeks I managed to shoot reasonably good heads of all the game on my license, except for the snow-1eopard, but I confess that I found the lack of company and the monotony of the diet somewhat oppressive, and wished, at times, that I had taken my leave on a house-boat on a Kashmir lake. However such an alternative would not have met with the approval of my military superiors, who expected subalterns to spend their leave in manly, hardy, outdoor sport and not among the fleshpots! However I did have the experience of a night of heavy snow (at about 10,000') at the end of June, and so was able to boast that I had been snowed on in India on mid-summer's night!? 3 After the experience of six weeks or so strange how tame and flat the mountains the pass on my way back, and as for the they were mere mole hills* in that country, it was looked from the top of mountains round Simla - a 11 owed to for Simla The summer of 1934 was little different to that of 1933 and it began to seem as if the life of a Light Battery, Roy alAr't i Her v had something in common with a yo-yo.

These were referred to as 'box-wallahs', from the imputed similarity of their occupation to that of the Indian traders, who used to bicycle around the cantonments with boxes on their carriers containing cloth and trinkets which they spread out on the verandahs of the bungalows for display - and hopefully sale - to the 'mem-sahibs'. The I.C.S. was not a bit like the Home Civil Service, who come to mind as an amorphous mass of sub-fusc-suited, nameless, faceless men who pass an endless chain of files across their desks in dark and dirty back rooms, while soot-laden rain streams incessantly down the windows . By contrast, the Civilians were born into the sunshine; for 99% of the administrat ion of India was looked after by Indians - and Indians who were uncovenanted - while the young I.C.S entrant stepped right onto the top of the heap. They were sometimes called by a translation of an Indian term for the Brahmins 'The Heaven-Born'. But even more esoteric and arcane was the Foreign and Political Department, who dealt not only with the External Affairs of India but represented the government at the courts of the rulers of the Indian States . And the gate to these Elysian Fields was open to the Army! No one wds recruited direct from the university to the Foreign and Politica! Department, but entrants were selected from Junior Indian Army officers and from the I.C.S. in the proportion of two to one. Hence the Brahmin title by which they were known was The Twice Born'. The service had originated in the I9th century24 - when generals fighting campaigns on the Indian frontiers had selected officers who had made themselves proficient in the languages and acquainted themselves with the customs of the country to conduct negotiations with friend and foe. The work !^ e c had d romantic image, the pay was equivalent to that of the I.L.b., and the pension awaiting an officer on retirement was above what he could expect as an army colonel. When fate put my battery Captain (a fellow 01d-Wykehamist) into the same railway-carriage on the Kalka-Simla train as a senior officer of Rnv 1°; ' t ’u d K Depa i rtment who was also an Old Wykehamist, the Old oy network began to hum, and word reached me that an application for transer to the Political might not be unsuccessful ; s ir n ° t gi . ven t0 an y ma ' bo know the future : the wise and the well-informed may suspect it, but we were neither wise nor weM informed and did not dream that England would be at war in five years' time.

The people of the frontier, the Pathans, had always exercised a strange fascination for Englishmen and I was no exception. In contrast to most Indians, they struck one as being manly, upstanding, and outspoken, and they had the reputation of being brave and skilful fighters in their own country. We were all keen to try ourselves out against them in the rough game of mountain warfare. Without a doubt they owed much of their success to the rugged nature of their mountains and to the fact that the back door was always open - when too hard pressed they could escape over the frontier to Afghanistan. Much the same situation has made a related people - the Kurds - egually formidable, until their back door was closed by the Shah towards the end of his reign, and their ability to defy the Iraoi Army was at an end.26 CHAPTER 5 Screwier Gunner Travelling through the Panjab towards the Frontier, one was slowly moving from one climatic zone to another, and one realised T h rL‘ he „r m0 ? h , U,S , had T kno ”' the area round Ambala as Sar-i-Hind or Poonni Indla - To th e east were mango groves'; Banyan and Peepul trees and occasional areas of jungle : to the west vast n a H nS ’H°h Ce »l an&lt; l,' y desert&gt; but now covered with waving corn crops produced by the harnessing for irrigation of the 5 great rivers and sparsely covered with thorn trees of no great size. The difference is brought about by the fact that the effect of the monsoon rains becomes progressively less, and more of the annual rainfiill occurs in the winter. There never seem to be any trees close at hand, yet the horizon is always an unbroken wall of trees. One has a feeling of spring in the early months of the year ns eadof the 'end of the cold weather' sensation that one feels India proper. With the summer, and the melting of the i n Himalayan snows, the rivers and canals the growing crops and a green freshness flood and bring water to to the whole countryside. a 1 wavs°thp' nIt ^r'' t ^ ave,1ers outside the few large towns was always the Dak Bungalow - a one-storied adobe building in a bare compound which contained two or three sparsely furnished bedrooms /lu tlnq and dlnin( l r oo m - There might be a resident cook W&lt;3S ’ the menu was alwa y s roast chicken and caramel custard otherwise one s servant cooked what he could get - chicken.

It was, in than a form of undeclared apartheid.

Peshawar lies in a bowl of the hills only a few miles distant rom the mouth of the Khaibar pass.

Indeed one occasionally saw a long trench leading from one of the fortified homesteads to the road, so that the inhabitants could crawl under over to where they could stand upright in safety. The Afridis are one of the aboriginal Pathan tribes who inhabited the same area at the time of Herodotus, over *2 000 years ago; and during all this time their society appears to have emained unchanged. They have no hereditary leaders - Khans or 'c men are equal, though divided into Mashars and Khashars, old men and youths, and acknowledging maliks or tribal28 representatives. Their country, at their own wish, was not administered, and they had no schools, hospitals, police or courts, and paid no taxes; instead they were paid 'allowances' by the Government for good behaviour. Every man always went armed, to defend his own family and its rights, and bitter blood feuds were carried over from generation to generation. Through all their history they have evolved no cohesive government or hierarchy, but appear content with a common poverty, for the pressure of population on the land is such that no man can build up a sizeable estate. This is how they like it : and they point out that the aim of society is to breed self-reliant men who call no man master, and that in this they are more successful than their neighbours. By contrast the Durranis of Afghanistan and the Yusufzais North of Peshawar, who are related, do have hereditary leaders and a system of law based on the Qoran. Somehow amidst this chaos Hindu and Sikh traders manage to survive and make a living by keeping shops in the occasional bazaars. Indeed there is a nice story of a Yusufzai Khan whose pride and joy was an old cannon which, when his fury could no longer be endured, he used to fire in the general direction of his rival's fort across the valley. This gave him great satisfaction, and was not unwelcome to his enemy who would then sell the only cannon-ball to the Hindu shopkeeper to pass on at a profit to the owner of the cannon! I feel there must be a moral in this somewhere as the arrangement was eminently satisfactory to all three of them. At the end of the Kohat Pass is an impressive archway - the Handyside memorial to the memory of an intrepid Frontier policeman killed in a skirmish - and, as one passes under it, the plain, village and Cantonment of Kohat are spread out a thousand feet below backed by serried ranges of lower but rugged mountains, cutting it off from the Indus valley. From Kohat the road runs south up a pleasant valley to Hangu, the headguarters of the Frontier Constabulary, and then slowly drops to Thai, the rail-head of a narrow gauge strategic railway. Nearly all the way the Samana ridge rises sheer to 6,000 feet on the right and behind it lies the Orakzai Tirah which is Tribal Territory, while on the left lesser ridges comprise the land of the Bangash and Khattack tribes, which is administered. Thai is at the point where the valley of the Kurram river emerges from the hills. This charming valley is inhabited by the Turi tribe, who being Shiah, felt themselves threatened by their Sunni neighbours, and therefore reguested British protection which they were granted. At the head of the valley, at about 5,000 feet lies Parachinar ('the Fairy Plane-tree'). This was the nearest British outpost to Kabul, and a few miles beyond it lies the Peiwar Kotal pass and the Afghan frontier. To the left, as you31 Apart from those detivities, there W3S the never-ending up-hill task of learning Pashtu - the involved and complicated language of the Pat bans. The first phrase which every British officer was taught was the greeting Sterai mashay and I believe for over a hundred years wrongly translated as 'May you never be tired.' One couldn't help thinking 'how silly, what's wrong with being tired - it can be guite pleasant at times!' Of course it didn't mean that at all, as I found out years later. Sterai , translated as 'tired', really means 'defeated', 'at your last gasp', 'at the end of your tether, or, as we say in Ireland^'bet'. It was only later when I found^ that the_Persian eguivalent among the nomads of Khorasan was Wpandeh na bash id 1 that I realised the true meaning. Mandeh na bash id means 'may you not be left behind'. One coul d” watch tTTe co 1 umns of Ghilzai tribesmen, women and children, flocks and chickens, tied on the back of camels, coming down the pass in the autumn, to escape the cold and snow of the Afghan highlands to graze their flocks and work as labourers in the warmer climate of the Indus Valley - much as the ancient Persians used to move continually between the highlands of the Elburz in the summer and the plains of Irag in the winter, and realise that in such a society the old and the feeble would have to be left behind when only the infants (and the chickens) could be accommodated on the backs of the camels. For those left behind, there would only be the crows and the vultures and, at nightfall, the wolves and jackals. Later I realised that the cry of our Lord on the cross 'Fli Eli Lama sabackthani (spoken in Syriac, but perfectly intelligible in modern Arabic) means just 'My God, my God, why hast thou left me behind.?* The Pathans were not of course, the only danger - there was disease. Sitting on the lawn and enjoying a sundowner before dinner, a major in the Bombay Grenadiers remarked jocularly that I would have to stand Champagne all round that evening as I had just heard that I had passed my Higher Standard Pashtu examination. As he said it he fell off his chair. We carried him to the hospital a few yards away, and the Doctor said 'Go in and have dinner. If he's alive when you finish he'll probably be all right.' As it happened he was dead by the time we finished. It was cerebral (or tertiary) malaria, and we drank no champagne that night. Footnote : * Matthew 27 vs 46 Arabic Sabaga - to outpace, outstrip. Hence Sabag = a race.32 An advantage of service on the Frontier was that one qualified for three months furlough instead of two. In 1935 I was entitled to this, and started off for Bombay by the narrow-gauge 'Thai Queen' to Kohat, and then by the ordinary Indian broad gauge railway for the journey of two days and a night to Bombay. It was a different world : lush and humid, for the monsoon had started, and I was glad to leave next day by an 11 a 1ia n Llo yd-Trestino liner from Bombay. The journey cost no more than £15 to Venice, travelling 'Secundo economico' - a euphemism for steerage class - and was really quite comfortable. As we left the harbour after a good lunch, the monsoon hit us and we pitched and rolled unceasingly for three days. During all of this time the man in the bunk below me chain-smoked 'Gold Flake' cigarettes and, although I was not actually sick, the experience cured me of any wish ever to smoke cigarettes - an excellent and most efficient course of 'aversion therapy'! Venice was plastered with posters of Mussolini in full spate, for the Italian invasion of Abyssinia was underway. The Spanish Civil War was also starting, and I suppose a really keen soldier should have found his way to one of these conflicts, to study his profession. However, I was to eager to see my parents and family after three years separation, and spent my leave quietly and unexcitingly in Oxford, where my father (who had by then retired from the Sappers) was teaching Survey to new entrants to the Colonial Services. On return from leave, I rejoined my battery in Kohat where we had been transferred and where we spent a very pleasant year. Since there was an Indian cavalry regiment - Probyn's Horse - we were able to play polo twice a week, and we frequently had to follow a hard game of polo by an even more strenuous game of hockey with the Indian troops.33 CHAPTER 6 Gin and Garlands In October 1936 came the post of c r z%v°:z Within a few weeks, the battery was to active service.

However the sheer impracticality of it soon came home to him, and he subsided shamefacedly into his seat . As we progressed south-east to Delhi along the Grand Trunk Road, through the already familiar rich farmlands of the Panjab and thence south to Rajputana, not only did the vegetation change but the atmosphere and the people. The ubiguitous thorn-trees of North India seemed thornier and sparser, and the people thinner and darker, but whatever they may have lacked in physical sturdiness, they made up for in pride. The drivers of my first section in 12 Light Battery had been Rajputana Rajputs and I knew the breed . At the border of Alwar State we left British India, and entered what has been called 'Indian India'. This was the point at which my master. Sir George, would order his chauffeur to stop and unfurl the Union Jack on the bonnet of the car! We were now in Rajputana, territory which had only briefly been conguered, never occupied, or taken over by the British (nor by their Central Asian predecessors for the matter of that) but was still ruled by its native Indian rulers under its native Indian rules. My Rajput soldiers were always adamant that life in the princely states was far preferable to life in British-ru 1 ed India. They may have been right, but one had to remember that they were Rajputs living in Rajput states and the views of the lower castes (who may well have outnumbered them) may not have exactly co-incided. Alwar had had a not very happy recent history. The late Maharajah had been somewhat ahead of his time in flaunting his sexual perversions (nowadays he would merely be indulgently described as 9^y')» but he had capped this by always we a r i n g gloves to shake hands with Europeans, in order to avoid 'defilement'! However, his unforgiveab 1 e crime had been to order a polo pony which he thought had played badly to be burnt alive; and he had been removed from his state and sent into exile in Bombay, while the administration was taken over by a Political Officer pending the installation of a new and more suitable ruler. This action was justified by the doctrine of ' paramountcy' , adumbrated by the Political Department, whereby the government, although in theory merely in treaty relations with the states, realised that it was seen, in the eyes of the world,as responsible for the whole country and the preservation of human (and equine) rights, as well as for the preservation of a reasonable standard of administration. So the Maharajah of Alwar had to go.35 &amp; As it happened, the next state we passed through had had an equally unfortunate recent history. The late Maharajah of Bharatpur had bankrupted his state by wild extravagance and had been asked to leave and live elsewhere, while a Pblitical Officer took over the administration and nursed the state back to financialhealth. Meanwhile his son and heir, a teenage boy, was sent to live with a r e tir e d Political Officer and his wife in England, and be trained in good and sensible housekeeping. This seemed to have worked satisfactorily until the boy, having returned and been installed as Maharajah, found himself in the vast saddlery department of the Army and Navy stores in Bombay. He was sensibly enough choosing himself a saddle, and enquiring about prices and quality, when he saw another Ruling Prince enter the department. This was too much! He said 'I can't be bothered to pick and choose. I'll buy the whole department. Wrap it up and send it to Bharatpur!' C'etait magnifique mais ce n*eta it pas le shopping. Ultimately he, too, had to go. It would be wrong to give the impression that all princely Rulers were equally off-beat : many ran their states efficiently and were devoted to the well-being of their subjects. Finally we drew up before the splendid edifice that was the Residency at Ajmer. It stood on an eminence overlook!’nq a large, tranquil lake surrounded by elegant pavilions, and no human habitations had been allowed to obstruct the view. Unbeknownst to me, my arrival had caused something of a stir : not only had I sent my horses and grooms ahead of me by rail and had arrived in my own car with two more servants, but a letter had arrived from an aunt, whose husband held the exalted position of Financial Member of the India Council in London, exhorting Lady Ogilvy to be kind to her 'favourite nephew'! My chief kept no horses and had no motor-car. Besides a government limousine, a railway saloon was at his disposal, and a friendly ruler by tradition lent another car and driver. (This somewhat questionable arrangement was terminated by my boss on hehalf of himself and his successors shortly before I left, but as he had then only a few weeks to serve before his retirement, the loss was no doubt felt more by his successors than by himself.) Not only was I graciously received, but was charmed to find in residence an attractive blonde daughter, whose marriage was going through a difficult period, and who had flown to the shelter of her mother's wing. One could hardly have asked for more. The duties of the Personal Assistant to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner of Ajmer-merwara were not exacting. It was a posting lasting for six months during which one's suitability for appointment to the Political36 Department was appraised. (My predecessor had been returned to store because, in addition to other shortcomings, he had come into dinner smoking his pipe and had placed the object, still fuming, beside his place! I understood he had been brought up in Australia ) . Apart from being under the microscope, one had to do the work (if that is the right word) of an A.D.C. The complexities of the Indian Warrant of Precedence had to be mastered. That vast tome listed all the Government appointments in India in order of importance, and woe-betide the unfortunate who placed the wife of an Assistant Superintendent of Police above the wife of an Inspector of Canals'at the dinner table! An extract from the Warrant of Precedence of the Government of India published in 1940 (in the midst of our 1 i f e-and-death struggle with Nazi Germany!) shows how specifically the hierarchy was ranked! '.. 48 Actuary to the Government of India; Chief Inspector of explosives; Chief Judges of Small Cause Courts, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta. Controller of Printing and Stationery; Directorof major laboratories. 49 Administrators-General; Central Intelligence Officers; -- Controllers of Patents and Designs; Directors of Land Records; Directors of Veterinary Services, etc. etc.' Years later, travelling home, I found myself sitting on the verandah of Shepherds Hotel in Cairo with a man returning from Tanganyika. I mentioned that I was thinking of settling in Kenya after the war, and he pressed me to choose Tanganyika instead. 'But,' said I, (thinking of height above sea-level as I was returning from the Persian Gulf), 'How high up are you in Tanganyika?' 'Well,' said he, bridling some what, 'I'm the Deputy Chief Sanitary Supervisor to the Government!' These things m at t er . Lorna (Lady Ogilvy) was steeped to the core in Precedence. The story is told of her visiting the sick-bed of the wife of one of her husband's subordinates. As the young woman drew herself up in bed and pulled up the sheets, Lorna trilled 'Lie down, my dear, lie down. No Precedence in the bedroom!' George Nathaniel Curzon (again) by this time Viceroy of India, was asked to approve the menu for a state luncheon. He crossed out the soup cour se and noted in the margin 'Gentlemen do nnt paF soup at luncheon!' “ 2 — — Fortunately there was more to be done than functioning at parties and receptions. Parliament, after years of gestation, had just produced the Government of India Act 1935, acclaimed as one of the best pieces of legislation ever to reach the statute book. There is no doubt that, if it could have been brought into force, it would probably have preserved India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh as one immensely37 powerful and stable state, and would have prevented several internecine wars and millions of deaths. However it was necessary before this could happen, for the Indian States to 'accede'. It was felt that, as Independent States in treaty relations with the Crown, they could not be coerced into accession (no such scruples deterred the independent Indian Government a few years later when they ruthlessly obliterated the States) and officers were deputed by the Government of India to tour the states, explain the provisions of the Act, quell the fears of the Rulers and nudge them towards accession. 'Sam' Wyllie (later, as Sir Francis Wyllie, Governor of the United Provinces) was deputed by the Government of India to tour the Rajputana States and explain the provisions of the Act to the Rulers. I got the impression that my master's nose was put slightly out of joint by the arrival of a 'whizz-kid' from headquarters to confer with 'his' princes, but he was too accomplished a diplomat to allow this to become apparent. He allowed me to sit in on the discussions and, although most of it passed over my head (and, I suspect, of many of the others taking part), the ultimate impression was that the rulers did not so much need persuasion as pushing, and hard and ruthless pushing at that. Their subjects were happy and contented in the main (though one was somewhat dismayed to see them bending double and throwing dust on their heads as the Majarajah’s cavalcade passed by) and there was very little Congress agitation, or pressure for change. The Rulers, very naturally, did not feel any necessity to change their traditional way of life, and their loyal subjects only had to shake the dust out of their turbans. It all added up to a grand tour of the score or so of the states of Rajputana, where we were entertained in the palaces or guest-houses of the princes. For relaxation there were some spectacular shoots. At Bharatpur there was a vast lake, dotted with butts for some 100 guns, and covered with wild duck which wintered there after breeding in Siberia in the summer. The water was only about six foot deep and elephants were ridden round to keep the duck on the move and pick up the victims with their trunks. So efficient were they that, when we assembled for luncheon, more ducks had been collected than were claimed by the guns.After luncheon, not unnaturally, more ducks were claimed than were picked up! Even in my rather distant butt and using only one gun I managed to fire over 200 cartridges; but what the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, who was the quest of honour, must have fired from his two guns I can't imagine. He wore a gadget on his belt which he clicked each time he downed a bird to keep count and I couldn't help thinking that something similar might have been of use to some of the maharajahs to keep tally of their concubines! I am very glad to hear that the Gunner Jheel is now a wild life reserve.38 Another memorable visit was that to Jaipur. The day started soon after dawn with a jackal-hunt with the Maharajah’s private pack. Interesting enough, but not to be compared to fox-hunting at home owing to the lack of fences to jump. The rising sun soon sucked up any scent so, after breakfast, an A.D.C. and I went duck-shoot i ng. The Jhee1 had a large population of crocodiles which one could see sTi ding off into the water ahead of one, but I had been led to believe that they are timid brutes which take to the bottom at the sound of shots. I was shooting very badly, so when I eventually downed a duck which fell into the water about 40 yards from shore, I felt I had to retrieve it to have something to show. I put down my gun and swam out and fetched it, but, on the way back, began to doubt whether what I had heard about the timidity of crocodiles was really all that accurate. I never swam so fast in my life! After lunch we watched a game of really superb polo (the Jaipur team were then champions of the world); and while we were watching, word was brought that a tiger had been tracked to a nearby hill. A party went out and, by the time the game had finished, a magnificent 10 foot tiger was laid out on the lawn. In the evening there was a ball. No Indian ladies attended of course, but there were a number of English ones staying at the palace, and it was a very splendid occasion. Poor Sir George had the intensely embarassing duty of taking his host, the Maharajah, to task about his association with an English girl. The trouble was that she came of a family so illustrious that his only possible reaction, if he had been privileged to meet them in England, would have been to kow-tow. However he did his duty, fortified, no doubt, by the thought that such a liaison struck at the very roots of the relationship between the Rulers and the Ruled. This was, of course, well understood. The Rajputs themselves would never marry their daughters to anyone - even another Raj put - whom they considered the least bit inferior incaste, although they might not object to one of their males taking a female of a - slightly - inferior caste. The Maharajah's liason, if allowed to continue, would have implied superiority to the Rajputs and inferiority to the British. Not on! The nuances of caste were, although uncodified, familiar to all. The prince accepted as the purest and most blue-blooded of the Rajputs was the Maharaj-Rana of Udaipur - who happened to be a miserable cripple, but whose house had never given a daughter to the Moghul Emperors - unlike most of the other Rajput princes. Other rulers went by different titles : there were Maharajahs, Maharanas, (the females were Maharanis), Rajahs and Thakurs. Nawabs were Muslim and outside the caste system, not that they didn't have their problems. The Nawab of Tonk , for instance, was in trouble because he had fallen deeply in love with his younqest nothing he could do about it. He was succeeding his elderly father, had had the nil or f n h? eC V- 0 /Vi and found that his youngest motner was a deectable little creature in her teens, to whom he lost his nroMo Unfortunately I left Rajputana before I heard how problem was solved. h areem mother, and there was a young man who , on trotted out for mother os t the39 The Hindu Caste System, like all forms of apartheid, did not work with a hundred percent efficiency. By long established custom, Hindu Rulers who had no heir would adopt a boy of the right caste who possibly came of a very poor village family. Since caste did not prevent Rajput males, when young and lusty, from enjoying the charms of lower-caste or even 'untouchable' girls, it would be illogical to assume that the females were immune from the same temptation. Indeed there was one very important Maharajah (adopted in his youth) who I am sure, to judge by his physionomy, was of Dravidian origin. After all, what is sauce for the gander must, in the nature of things, be sauce for the goose! Our Grand Tour of Rajputana reached its climax in Bikaner where the Maharajah had a house (or palace?) party of about 70 people for Christmas. The bird-s1aughter was particularly successful, although it was somewhat distasteful to be expected to shoot sand-grouse or, worse still, Kung Cranes flying in from the desert for their daily drink of water. The Constitutional discussions were more than usually illuminat ing, because the Princes had hired an American, Judge Wadhams who was an expert on Constitutional Law, to advise them. I never heard a neater picker of nits; and it was clear that he interpreted his mission as one to devise excuses for the Princes not acceding to the proposed federation; which, in the outcome, they declined to do. Lady Ogilvy excelled herself by taking me to task for proceeding to the ante-room before dinner, instead of waiting outside her bedroom door to carry her wrap and follow her in. She also took exception to the Maharajah (who no doubt naturally felt the need for variety) placing Lady Metcalfe on his right at dinner from time to time. Sir Aubrey Metcalfe was Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, but ranked as junior to Sir George when within the limits of Rajputana; and he retaliated with the following verse : - 'I told you, Pat, to search that silly Warrant, You merely answer that there is no place. Allotted in it for the First Class! widow. Unless she be by birth of noble race. My place is at the right hand of the Ruler, And never will my stomach proud agree.

I could only stare him out and marvel how yellow his eves were: and finally, after whisking his tail in a highly menacfn fashion for some time, he gave a snarl (which I am sure ’ translated into human language would be unprintable) got uo took himself off. K i ani n incident not long after was probably even more dicey. The local bhi1s (aboriginal jungle dwellers) came to me to report that a black bear, which had been damaging their crops, had taken refuge in a cave and would I please come and shoot it We approached the cave up-hill over a scree of boulders on which it Wd ^ u CU ** t0 maintain a footing, and did our best to flush out the bear by throwing in stones from a few yards away After some time there was a sudden roar followed by an eruption of bear. Luckily it fell dead at the first shot and, on approaching it, we found it was a female with two cubs about the size of cats clinging to its belly. Had I known it was a female with cubs I would not, of course, have shot it : but I was able to rear the cubs for a few days and then presented them to the local zoo. An interesting episode arose from the visit of two American ladies to Mount Abu. They were of some importance, and I received instructions from the A.6.6. to conduct them personally round the sights. In the course' of our peregrinations we entered a emple and found the Saddhu seated on the ground in meditation and we seated ourselves respectfully before him. His personality was such that he gave out an almost palpable aura of saintliness n when he spoke the American ladies were so moved that they said Can we give him some money?' I told them that it would be most inappropriate, but nevertheless they could not be prevented from scattering some small coins before him 'for the poor'. How42 to make them understand that feeding the poor meant nothing to him? Guiding their feet in the way of righteousness - yes; but feeding merely encourages them to proliferate. After all’ our Lord said 'The poor are always with you, but the Son of Man...' (This particular Saddhu, I afterwards discovered, could have had as much money as he cared to ask for from any of the princes of Rajputana if he had cared to ask for it). It is possible to emerge from an excellent restaurant in India and find a starving beggarman and a starving beggar woman lying on the pavement; to drop them a rupee (a small fraction of the cost of one's dinner); to see their faces light up with joy : and to come back a year later to find the starving beggar-man and the starving beggar-woman lying in the same place, with a starving beggar-baby between them. The Saddhu of mount Abu would have had more sense. The so-called 'green revolution', which increased the agricultural production of India so dramatically after the war by improved seeds, fertilisers, and methods of cultivation, was merely an extrapolation. The end result was to increase the population and the pressure on the food supply, so that the standard of living - or dying - remained the same.43 CHAPTER 7 Under Training Eventually my six months under the microscope Assistant came to an end and I was posted to weeks course in Secretariat procedure.

This procedure was slow, but had the advantage that the perio^of°years dec ' slon could always be ascertained even after a On the course, we had the files placed before us with some or all of the notes removed, and had to deal with them as though we were one or other of the officials involved. It gave one an excellent insight into the working of the Secretariat. After some weeks of this - interspersed I was transferred to Quetta, to fill Baluchistan Secretariat there. For this meant I could pass the rest of the feet and see a new part of India. with polo at Annandale - a junior vacancy in the I was grateful, as it summer in the cool of 6,000 In the autumn of 1937 it was time for me to begin the serious my tralrnn 9. . and 1 w as transferred to Sialkot in the Panjab to work as Assistant Commissioner to learn Revenue work as a junior magistrate to learn something about the Criminal law’44 and as a judge in civil cases. Revenue work , it should be explained, has no counterpart in the British Isles. In India the British had taken over the Mogul system intact, and this was based on the proposition that all land belongs to the Government and that individuals hold it and cultivate it on a basis of 'share-cropping.' The moguls demanded 50% of the crop, but this was very inefficiently assessed and collected ; we aimed to take 25 - 30% but, as it was more rigorously enforced, this was not such a boon to the cultivators as it sounds. At intervals of 20 years or so a 'Settlement' of each district would be made, and an officer of the I.C.S. (or in the North-West Frontier Province the Political) would have to assess the yield of each holding and its value and decide what 'land revenue' was due from each and every cultivator in cash. This was a formidable and thankless task which, I am glad to say, I was never called upon to perform. Land Revenue accounted for the bulk of the income of the Government, as other taxation was rudimentary; and was collected by a hierachy of officials of which the chief in each district was the Deputy Commissioner (or Collector in the older provinces) , and the lowest - but the lynch-pin of the system - was the village patwari with his cloth map showing every field of his village. As a magistrate, third class, one had to try minor criminal cases and one's powers of sentencing were limited, but the experience it provided of human nature and human deviation was unlimited. The lawyers on either side, and a capable Hindu Clerk of the Court, helped one not to stray too far from the correct interpretation of the law; but the main problem was, naturally, the correct assessment of the evidence. Mostly this was false,* and delivered in the local dialect of Punjabi which, of course! one had to learn from scratch. As one had to transcribe it, in longhand, in English, it was an extremely effective way* of learning the language and the main reason why, on taking the examination in Panjabi a few months later, I was able to achieve a mark of 93%. Frustrations were frequent. I remember a case in which one of the parties persistently found excuses for not appearing, thus compelling his opponent (a poor man), to go to the expense of bringing his witnesses to court only to be sent away. On one occasion he produced a medical certificate that he was unfit to appear, signed by an Indian doctor who was known to provide such certificates for a trifling sum. The police sergeant told me that he was sitting outside the court in perfect health, and accordingly I went to my mentor, the Deputy Commissioner, to ask what I could do to enforce his appearance in the interests of justice. The answer was 'Nothing. No other doctor would sign a45 certificate to the effect that this man was fit yesterday this certificate was signed.'

There was not the stately splendour of ancient trees and gardens that distinguished some of the Cantonments further East, but there intolerable summer. was less Up to the end of April there was no oppressive heat, provided one took the necessary precautions to minimise it, but from May onwards it mounted until the break of the monsoon at the end of June. Then, although the temperature was somewhat lower the air was damp and muggy, moss grew in one's shoes and hornets ’ ho 1ed up m one's shirts. When the monsoon cleared away, the September weather was only pleasantly hot, and there began 8 months of which nobody could complain. Added to this, less than fifty miles to the North were the foot-hills of the Himalayas, and from May onwards, when the snow had melted from the passes, one could drive to Kashmir in a day. 'If there is a heaven on the face of the Earth, it is this, it is this, it is this 1 ' hardly over-praisesKashmir. J But living conditions for a bachelor Civilian were rather different from those of a military officer. No Mess! No army quarters. One rented a bungalow in Cantonments (unthinkable to live outside the area laid out for Europeans, regulated and supervised by Health Officers and Sanitary Inspectors). We had tap-water safe to drink, whereas a sip of the city water was believed to be an invitation to the typhoid bug; but we had no sewerage. Having arranged to rent one's bungalow, one then had to furnish it; and to do this one went to some enterprising merchant who kept a stock of furniture for hire. Needless to say it was all depressingly dull and unimaginative, but then everyone else was in the same boat and we averted our eyes from each other's appurtenances. After all, we felt, we weren't in India forever and it would be foolish to collect treasures, as well as impractical - as one could be transferred from one place to another at short notice. An Indian merchant (a millionaire) with whom I was recently discussing life in pre-partition India said to me You must have lived like a prince!' I had great46 difficulty in persuading him that it wasn't like that at all - far from it! I rememberno occasion in my year and a half under training as a junior Civil Servant in India when I had any social contacts with Indians. For one thing there was the feeling that they might lead to friendships and involvement and hence to the loss of one s impartiality, and for another most Indians were unversed in Western manners and customs. I never even had a drink or a meal under my Deputy Commissioner's roof although, as a graduate of an English university he was cultured and sophisticated, his wife would never have appeared before a stranger. Indeed many years later, when my wife used to call on the wife of a senior Pakistani official, the latter's response to the rhetorical guestion 'How do you do?' was to launch into a description - with no detail spared - of the struggles she was having with her t ape-worm! After securing a bungalow and hiring furniture for it, one's next problem was to employ a Khansama or cook. For some reason, while one's bearer and driver travelled with one from place to’place, this class of employee was non-1ransferab1e. One took on a fresh one at each new station to which one was posted. There were plenty of candidates with sheaves of references (of which most were forged) and it was quite a problem to sort them out. Having been selected and employed, the Khansama would set himself out to show the excellence and variety of his repertoire. As one discovered only too late, the secret was then never to praise him or congratulate him on any particular dish. If you did so he would say to himself 'Thank heaven I have found what the so-and-so likes', and would bring in a youth - described as an assistant-cook - and teach him how to prepare it. From that time on one was offered nothing else, while the Khansama found himself additional employment with another household and repeated the process, thus drawing two or more salaries at the same time. These problems, however, I was able to hand over to my sister, Biddy, who came out for the winter to keep house for me, and very well she did it. ★★★★ ★★★★ There were two cavalry regiments stationed at Sialkot - the 3rd Carabiniers of the British army and the 2nd Lancers of the Indian, so we had two days of very enjoyable polo a week. Apart from this the D.C. assigned to me the task of investigating and reporting on the economic circumstances of the village of Kotli Loharan, interesting because the inhabitants were lohars or blacksmiths and had a tradition of migrating to East A'f r i c a or elsewhere to earn a better living than the village could provide. I don't suppose anybody ever read my report - I am sure47 me a very It also the Can al the DC was far too busy - but the compiling of it gave valuable insight into the life of a Punjab village, meant that I could spend spells near the village iri th^rh 1 ’ ° k bun 9 alow at Marala at the foot of the Himalayas where * ^ 7 ver ^bouches and is dammed by a barrage providing irrigation for a vast area of land. In charqe was an Anglo-Indian Canal Officer who happened to have an extremely luscious teen-age daughter who suffered intense boredom from ving in a place where she saw nobody but her parents. She used to accompany me when I took my gun out for an evening walk wearing the hottest of hot pants to show off her very seductive thighs. It was guite a strain to keep the oath which my mother and sister had extorted from me on leaving England - not to become involved with a girl 'of the country'. I am glad to say that I saw her during the war at an Officers dance in Peshawar and obviously much in demand. From the fact that she was careful not to recognise me I deduced that she exercised some reticence as to her origins and I was glad to respect her wishes! * ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ During the monsoon I in the Himalayas to for a breath of fresh was sent up to the hill-station of Dalhousie undergo Treasury training and, incidentally, s ummering in Kashmir). air (my sister was Each District had a Treasury into of the Government and from which had to be made.

I found the whole business unutterably boring, and I am afraid I was not much good at it. However it was pleasant to have a few weeks of cool weather in the summer out of the stifling heat of theplains. In the autumn of the of Sind cal led Si a 1kot came orders of transfer to Multan in the South-West Punjab. This was a large and ancient city on the borders North-West Frontier Province, and the language, was markedly different from the Panjabi of and the L a h n d i . Another difference was that I found myself under the tuition of a bachelor Deputy Commissioner, Kenneth Henderson, in whose house I lived, together with three other trainees. It was a hapov community. There was no polo, unfortunately, as there was only an infantry regiment stationed in Multan, but the shooting, particularly duck and snipe, was excellent, and although the summer fairly murderous, the winter and spring - which I spent there - were delightful. was climat e all the was time48 There had recently been a particularly vicious outbreak of communual rioting in Multan in which hundreds of Muslims and Hindus had been murdered and millions of rupees worth of damage had been caused by the burning of shops and bazaars. As a new-comer, free of local involvement or bias, I was deputed to try the case which had triggered off the whole deplorable outburst. It turned out to be a trivial incident in which two Muslim women draped from head to foot in the traditional burqa had entered a Hindu shop and secreted (or had not?) various goods beneath their draperies. The shopkeepers had searched them and thus violated (or so they claimed) their chastity, providing the spark which set off an immense conflagration. In the spring I was ordered to attend the meeting of the Chamber of Princes in New Delhi, at which, I imagine to their lasting regret, they decided not to accede to the proposed Federation of India. My duties were purely formal - meeting their Highnesses on arrival - and I was not privileged to attend their deliberations. My journey there was unforgettable. I set out to drive the four hundred and something miles from Multan to Delhi in one day, and found the road cut by floods in the South-East of the Punjab. This involved leaving the road and driving across fields and over rough country for more than twenty miles. When I eventually arrived in Delhi I fell asleep in my bath. Finally orders came for my first posting - as Vice-Consul in Seistan in South-East Persia - and I set off via Quetta where I sadly played my last game of polo, sold my polo-ponies and headed West. It was the spring of 1939 and I was just 27 years old.CHAPTER 8 The Land of the Scythians and of the Wind Strange as i t Teheran, had Baluchistan, dividing line India was Kavir and 1939-1945 may seem, although having no represent at i on in East Persia When British armies occupied Iran between those based on Iraq and an Ambassador at - Khorasan and in 1914-1918 the those based in roughly North-South through the deserts of the Dasht-i- the Dasht-i-Lut.

Apart from passing through the customs, one's contact with Persians was virtually nil. They were forbidden by Riza Shah to mix with foreigners, so until I reached Z^bul and exchanged formal calls with the Governor of Seistan I had practically no opportunity of meeting an educated Persian. Seistan, (three syllables, please, meaning the land of the Sakai or Scythians) was a country sui generis and quite untypical of the rest of Persia, a vast depression into which the run-off from the central mountains of Afghanistan (the ancient land of Ghor) flows. The people, too, looked different from the ordinary run of Persians or Afghans, having blunter features and more sturdy figures, rather reminiscent of the Panjabi Oats or the Kashmiris. When I arrived there, there were upwards of 4 000 square miles under water (the Helmand river ends there and never reaches the sea) and in the winter it seemed that there was a wild duck to every six inches of it! In the summer they would migrate to Siberia to breed. In addition there were snipe in myriads and black partridges or francolin in the vineyards. The town, road was to reveal was or village, of Zabul presented a strange aspect The bordered by high mud walls, falling down here and there that there was nothing behind them. The explanation that it had been honoured, a few years before, by a visit from the Shah and the walls had been built to give his Imperial Majesty the impression that the place was much bigger and more populous than in fact it was. It was June and the b ad - i - s ad-o - bTs t r' uz ('wind of 120 days’) was blowing with its full force. It starts every year with clockwork precision in May_and JbJows until August, having risen in the area aptly known as Bad Khiz ('Wind-rise') adjacent to the Karaqum desert in the extreme South of Russian Central Asia. Thence it blows with great force down the Persian-Afqhan border South to the Afghan-Baluchistan border where it veers to the East and peters out. It has left a terrible mark on Seistan, for no tree stands much more than a dozen feet or so high, and all lean over from North to South at a sharp angle. The Seistanis build special rooms orientated North/South with wide doorways in the North and South walls. The North one is hung with matting made from bull-rushes and this is kept constantly wet, which brings down the temperature considerably. Outside was one perpetual There was a skeleton staff of two Indian clerks, for whom, as for me, there was no work to do, and after I had given a tea-party tor the handful of Indian traders, I considered myself free to proceed to my summer quarters at Blrjand. To get there it was51 necessary to return almost all the way to Zahidan and then turn right on the Zahidan - Meshed road. All these roads were unmetalled and horribly corrugated, and driving was far from t^4-ftg a pleasure. However it was my first sight of Persia proper - albeit an arid and desolate fringe of it - but as we went North it became gradually less arid. We traversed a forbidding gorge with the Koh-i-malak-i-Si ah ('The mountain of the Black Angel') on our right and, forty or fifty miles on, the Palang Koh ('leopard mountain') on our left. I was to discover during the ensuing winter that it really was the habitat of leopards. A night was passed on the way in a mud hut belonging to the Consu1 ate-General , and kept to provide an over-night resting place for travellers, and the next day we reached the large village of Birjand, the capital of the Qainat, and the residence of the Amir Shaugat-u1-mu 1k, the paramount chief of East Persia Although shorn of his powers by Shah Riza he remained on good terms with him and was, in fact, one of his most trusted advisers. His son was, for many years. Minister of Court (a most important post in Imperial Persia) to the last Shah. The family were remarkably Anglophile as a result of contact with the British forces during the first World War, though they felt it politic to be discreet about it. Birjand lay about 4,700 feet above sea level, and the Vice-Consul's house a few hundred feet higher on the mountain-side some two miles to the South of the town. There was no 'wind of 120 days’ and the climate was beautifully clear, calm, and coo 1 . The town was surrounded by jagged, bare, brown mountains practically devoid of vegetation, but any -where that water could be brought to the surface there was an oasis of green. The method of bringing it to the surface was ingenious, and also practised in Baluchistan and Oman. Rainfall on the mountains would run off into the valleys where it would seep down through the loose rock or shingle until it reached an impervious sub-stratum. A shaft was therefore dug at the mouth of the valley down to the water, and others at intervals below it. The bottoms of these shafts were joined by a tunnel, lined with rings of baked clay, just sufficiently inclined to let the water flow down it but at less of an incline than the ground surface. At the bottom of the ganat , as it was called, the water would flow out and be available for cultivation. Some of these ganats are over 30 miles long and represent a very considerable capital investment .It was at the out flow of a small one of these that our house and the surrounding garden were situated, and very pleasant it was. The view was magnificent and the garden produced apples, pears, peaches, almonds and pomegranates, though one never seemed to be there at the right times of year to eat them! The valleys in the mountains also produced walnut trees including a variety called Kaghaz i (paper-shelled) of which the shell was so thin that it could Be cracked between the fingers. I have never encountered this variety of walnuts anywhere else. Pleasant as it was, one was allowed no contact with the Persians and the isolation and loneliness was extreme; but fortunately the Consul-General, Giles Squire, was a humane man and, after a week or so he ordered me up to Meshed. The journey North to Meshed (the conventional spelling : it should be Mash-had or 'Place of martyrdom') was one day's run over wide plains and low mountain and the barrenness of the countryside seemed gradually to decrease. A useful and rewarding diversion on these journeys was to give a lift to any lone pedestrian going in the same direction : useful because one could practice one's Persian, and rewarding because one could gain an insight into the mentality, ideas, and way of life of the country people. They never tried to 'thumb a lift' and were always embarrasing1y grateful when one picked them up, and willing to talk freely to a foreigner, away from any danger of detection by the police. Indeed they sometimes offered to pay for the lift! We stopped for lunch in a Persian restaurant in Turbat-i-Haidari, itself rather a pleasant change as one could never have done this in India. I was a little put out when a policeman lunching there came over to my table and demanded to see my passport (which I had already shown to the police post on entering the town, and would have to show again on leaving it), but it was an illustration of the extent to which the Persians based their procedures on those of the Russians. In British India no one, not even an obvious foreigner, would ever have been asked to show his papers . At last, as the sun was setting, we reached Meshed and, after driving down broad avenues lined with tall plane trees, found the British Consu1 ate-Genera 1 , a pleasant two-storied building standing in a garden of over an acre amid immaculate lawns shaded with planes, dotted with a large variety of fruit trees, and herbaceous borders filled with familiar English flowers. The contrast with the aridity of Baluchistan and the road from the south was striking. Instead of curried goat it was strawberries and cream! 5 253 CHAPTER 9 Mashhad-i-Mug add as (Meshed the Holy) I fell in love with Meshed at first sight: I don't know why. Perhaps it was the light. Unlike Seistan, where the light - when there wasn't a dust-storm - was dazzlingly bright, in Meshed it was incredibly clear and lucent : like nowhere else. Then there was the town itself which the Persians had made great efforts to Europeanise. Boulevards with round-abouts at the intersections planted out with petunias and shady plane trees, narrow side-streets where the houses had carved wooden balconies, and the old colourful oriental bazaars around the great mosgue. Russia was only forty or so miles to the North behind a range of low mountains. These were mostly inhabited by Turks speaking a language akin to the Uighur of Chinese Central Asia, and far removed from the Usmanli of Istanboul, - and all the droshky-drivers of Meshed were Turki speakers. In those mountains was the almost^ hidden, rock-girt valley of Kalat-i-Nadiri whence came Nadir Shah, congueror of Afghanistan and India, and perpetrator of a massacre in Delhi remembered to this day; indee^d they still speak of an exceptionally bloody massacre as a 'Nadir-Shahi' - perhaps a not very desirable way of attaining immortality but at any rate unusual. Then there were the pilgrims from aj1 over Asia; Persians of all sorts, Turks from Azerbaijan, Hazlras from Afghanistan (known locally as Berberis and descendants of a thousand (Hazar) families settled by the mongols in the mountains of Ghor as a rear-guard when they descended upon India, Turis from the North-West frontier, and Shias from North India and farther afield. A peculiarly Shia' Persian easement was available to these pilgrims they could marry a temporary wife or Sighi for the duration of their stay. It was an arrangement that~benefited all parties; the Mullahs collected their fees for freguent 'Marriage' ceremonies, the pilgrim, for a trifling outlay, could savour the joys of the honeymoon, have a roof over his head (for he would live in the 'wife's' house) and have his meals cooked for him, and the 'wife' would collect a small but useful sum of money. Ugly words like prostitution could not be applied to an arrangement which had the sanction of Holy Writ. Meshed 'the place of martyrdom' owes its origin as a town to the alleged murder of the eighth Imam of the Shia' faith - Imam Riza. Before that the provincial capital was just a few miles to the West - now the^rather decrepit village of Tus. Over the tomb of the martyred Imam was built a magnificent mausoleum covered by a huge dome of beaten gold, and round it were constructed various mosgues, courtyards and and madrassehs (schools of religious54 'Jewel of Joy'?, wife learning) principally that of Gauhar Sh'ad of Shah Rukh the mongol Emperor. All had either domes of gold or exquisite azure tiles. In the centre of one immense courtyard stands a decrepit hovel known .as the manzi1 -i-pir-i-zan or the old woman's house. The legend is thaf'she refused to sell her home inspite of magnificent offers and no doubt, every sort of pressure from the powers that were. It was cherished as a symbol of the justice, tolerance and humanity of those times. Qualities that were notable for their absence under the regime of Riza o n 3 n • Indeed the Shah's hand lay heavy on the Holy City. Khomeini - style clothing was not tolerated except within the mosques. Turbans were out. I saw a policeman tear the chadur (the flowered sheet in which they veiled themselves) from a “woman in the street. This conduct would have caused a major riot in India. Some older ladies never left their homes from the day the order was promulgated because they could not bear to be seen unveiled. Others, mainly younger, who were prepared to go along with this sudden projection into western mores were unclear as to the etiquette required and, for a time, took their hats off to each other on meeting! It is not generally appreciated in the west that the veil - ordained to protect the modesty of women - in fact works to exactly the opposite effect. Any veiled woman is unrecognisable even to her husband or brother from a foot or so away; she can dive into side-alleys and duck into dark doorways without ever being recognised, there to keep who knows what amorous, extra-marital engagements - and a great many do. Or , let us say, out of consideration for the present clerical regime, did. Even the gentle, peaceful villagers did not escape the Western wind. Their dignified traditional dress of a domed felt hat and long gown, crossed in front and belted with a sash ’ was considered too oriental. So the police at the post they had to pass on entering the town would knock off their hats and cut off their long coats at mid-thigh. Thus making them, in theory look more western, but in fact, slightly ridiculous and very unhappy. But the most outrageous humiliation inflicted on the forces of reaction was the opening of the shrine to unbelievers Previously the street and alleys leading to the shrine were barred by heavy iron chains at some distance from the holy precincts, marking the limit beyond which no unbeliever might proceed on pain of death. Not only were these removed, but unbelievers (and their cameras) were allowed into the shrine, and even into the Holy of Holies where the faithful writhed in paroxysms of grief clutching the gold railings of the sacred There the police would drive back the worshippers and invite the infidels to take photographs.55 I found it embarrasing and and never went a second architecture and decoration time and time again. repugnant to one's sense of decency time, in spite of the splendid which I would gladly have admired One evening soon after my arrival and full of curiosity about the city and abundant energy, I took myself off for a lonq exgloratory walk. I soon became aware of a figure in a rather shabby summer suit and panama hat tailing me at a discreet •a nd J lncre , aSed my P ace - As a ' ex-mountain gunner I rather prided myself on my ability to maintain a brisk six mi les-an-hour and this I did for upwards of two hours, until I turned into an outdoor cafe for a beer (it was possible to do that sort of thing in those days - but unthinkable under After a , few m1n etes a bent figure in a panama hat and tattered Persian slippers hobbled into the cafe and collapsed into a chair at a table behind me. I couldn't help feeling sorry for him and admiring his determination and devotion to duty so told the waiter to take him over a beer. To the best of knowledge he never tailed me again - perhaps he reckoned he blown in both senses of the word! my was The arrangements for keeping tabs on the comings and goings of the Consulate-General staff consisted of three or four youngish plain-clothesmen, wearing knee-breeches and puttees with bicycles at the ready, who spent the day thumbing over the magazines in a news-agents shop conveniently situated nearly opposite the Consulate-General gates. When a car emerged from the Consulate—General they would leap on their bicycles and follow it. Naturally we would finally stop round a corner and, when thev whir ed round it, pedalling furiously, would beg them not to burst themselves and tell them where we were going. Finally one of them made so bold as to come into the Consulate General and explain to the Vice-Consul that he got paid monthly and was already out of cash with a fortnight to wait for his pay and could we help? Of course we could! y ’ Police surveillance annoyance. was, in fact, more of an amusement than an was a m owed av w K un e surveillance carpets. We all spent ...

Pol ice 1 i m i t s surveillance seemed to stop for some reason at the town h ° ne d the 1nevitabl e police-post where one was qoina and drove on; it didn't seem to matter whether one went there or as one was no longer followed. e1s ewhere56 (§) Having familiarised myself with the city, I spent the rest of the summer exploring the mountains and valleys around and taking note of where the best concentrations of partridges were to be found The time passed very pleasantly and, to keep me occupied, the Consul-General Giles Squire (later, as Sir Giles Squire, Ambassador in Kabul), put me on to researching and writing a report on the history and raison-d'etre of the Seistan Consulate. The salient fact to emerge was that in the years before the first World War the Russians had maintained a consulate there with a staff of more than 50, including a Colonel in the post of Military Attache. They had been withdrawn after the Revolution but we still felt it politic to keep our foot in the door. Two years or so later I met a Baluch tribal leader in the area when Leningrad was under seige by the Nazis. He said 'Leningrad’won't tall. Its a great city and the people are indomitable.' I asked him how he knew and he said 'Oh, the Russians took me there before the first war and showed me round.' So they did make a not inconsiderable effort to win over the local tribal leaders; and there is no reason to suppose that they have ceased to do so.' Meanwhile the count-down to the War with Nazi Germany proceeded apace and it became clear that the expatriate community in Meshed were far from solidly behind the Allies. The American missionary doctor in charge of the leper hospital (most of the patients incidentally, were Berberies from central Afghanistan) reckoned thatthere was nothing much to choose between the Germans and the British : the manager of the British Bank of Iran was'an Irishman of strong Republican sympathies and, indeed, had only been prevented from taking part in the murder of British Officers in Dublin on Bloody Sunday, 1916, because his mother, whose two elder sons had already sallied forth to do or die, resolved that her youngest should not risk his life, and locked him in the loo : and the Indian medical officer of the Consu1 ate-General was a staunch Congress-man from Madras. For both of them, 'England's difficulty was Ireland's/India's opportunity.' The Persians, of course, were been in the first world war. solidly pro-Ge rma n - as they had Finally came Chamberlain's broadcast on September 3rd, followed immediately by the menacing sounds of the first air-raid sirens- and we were at war . * Naturally, I applied at once to be returned to the Army and in ue course, was told, as were all my cont empor ar i es, that my duties were too important to permit my release. This would have been easier to bear had I really had a job of work to do! Shortly after I returned to Birjand and thence to Seistan, where the winter was spent exploring the area and shooting.57 Unfortunately the time one could be absent from one's headquarters was limited by a regulation that one's cyphers unguarded for more than three possible to explore the area fairly short dashes. one days . thoroughly could not 1eave However it was in a series of The Hamims were . , . _ navigated in (or on) boats made from bundles of reeds (as in the marshes of Southern Iraq) po)ed by a str e race of peoole called sayy ads , ('hunters'), along narrow The immense variety of almost entirely on game.

I was fortunate enough to make contact with an intriguing character known as Mullah Kuhi (the Priest of the mountains). He was a Baluch who,'owing to a mi s-understanding with the forces of law and order,felt it politic to give them as wide a berth as possible. As he related 1 * _ 1S , encam Pment had been approached without warning by a partv of Gendarmerie and, quite naturally, he and his followers had fired several rifle shots in their general direction. This as every tribesman knows, is merely their way of saying 'Keep your distance and explain your business before coming any closer ' However apparently the gendarmes did not observe this convention and - f !'° m then on the 'mountainy mullah' was a wanted man. He r??il? ed i 1 a ^ h1 ^ occupation at the time had been smuggling a* 1anded oo the Persian shore of the Gulf to the tribesmen or Afghanistan - a practice disapproved of strongly by the British Indian authorities and, under pressure, by the Persians unless, of course, the customary rake-off was paid by the smugglers, which in the Mullah's case it obviously had not been. Living, as he had to, in deserts and mountains, he had become an expert s h i k ar i and was well versed in the habits Unfortunatelylis religious faith was somewhat of a of the game, hindrance. Whereas I insisted on leaving camp before dawn, and scaling the mountain to a vantage point whence one might spot ibex before they retired from the heat of the sun into crannies and caves the Mullah reckoned that this was a waste of time; Allah he maintained, would bring the ibex to one's tent-door if he wished one to shoot it! The Palang Kuh is an uneven plateau surrounded by absolutely fnntlhn H about 1,000 ft high presenting no visible foot-hold from top to bottom, yet astonishingly these precioices represented safety for the Ibex. One morningwe found evidence or an attack by a leopard on a group of ibex grazing on the level ground of the plateau. It was clear from the tracks that the eopard had his claws out, and it had only been a matter of inches before the ibex were able to dive over the precipice, eering down, and fighting against vertigo, one was unable to see58 a ledge upon which even a fly could have landed: yet the ibex had foHo^them th6 leopard ’ fe,1ne though it was, had been unable to Even the approach to the mountain was quite an undertaking. From the gully or depression where one had concealed and abandoned one s car there was a long, waterless, march to some Baluchi encampment. The only possible refreshment on the way was obtained by lying on one's stomach beside a stagnant ^ool scraping aside the green slime which covered it, shutting one's eyes and drinking - regardless of the myriad wild life which it contained. By good luck I avoided ingesting any of the leeches which swam almost thread-like in the water, but which if swallowed would fasten themselves to one’s gullet and suck blood incolvenien^e. Were fin 9 er ' sized cause considerable But the most extraordinary refreshment of all was drunk from a go at-skin (hair on the inside!) at the encampment. Into this went the milk of every animal which could possibly be milked - cow (rare), sheep, goat, camel, even mare. It was never cleaned out and was, naturally, a riot of bacterial activity. It had every thing : some of it was cheese, some yoghurt, curds, whey junket, and whatever unrestrained bacteria can make out of milk* But it was mighty refreshing - if one was thirsty enough. Back in Zabul one occasionally saw the Persian Army Brigade marching through the village. Never did I see a more depressing sight. They were conscripts, paid next to nothing, ha 1f-starved‘ ragged, down-at-heel and dejected. And well they might be ; their officers were also underpaid (a month's salary woud hardly buy a pair of boots) and had to make up their income by extortion f rom their troops. If, after sleuthing, a conscript was discovered to have private means or to come from a well-to-do family he found himself day after day detailed to clean out the latrines or carry out whatever most noisome and degrading task could be devised. On enguiring whether it might not be possible to arrange for more congenial employment he would be told by his immediate superior that 'yes, it could - in consideration of a cash payment - not for myself, of course, but for those higher up!' Later, I had the opportunity to ask a prosperous Persian Jew in Meshed, whose family came from Merv in Russia (but whose spiritual home was the Mile End Road), how he had fared with his National Service. He said 'It was easy. I made a point of being seen as often as possible in the company of the General, and when my time for conscription was near, I gave the Colonel to understand that_^the General and I had come to an understanding, but, I said, T_a clast-i-tun Kh~al i na bashad -\*so that your hand may not be emptyfp here Ts a thous and tomans for yourself.

The compound was surrounded by and the empty Consu1 ate-Genera 1 stood in the middle garden which, lacking the climate of Meshed and the Zabul , and Europeans - a high wall of a large loving care of a resident ‘owner* and his wife, was fairly derelict. However erect*' 665 W6re the best ln Seistan and some of them were almost A unique feature was that all the rooms were domed (as they are in all of southern Afghanistan) owing to the lack of building timber. The domes were lit by glazed sky-lights, the walls had for orndments &gt; lamps or books, and mud-brick ottomans lined the walls. This doesn't read like a breakthrough in interior decoration, but I found the domed ceilings gave me a serene feeling of tranquility - just as well because the only amusement apart from reading weeks-old newspapers was listening to the wireless. The cook, engaged locally, was called Ismail pronounced somewhere between 'smell' and 'smile', either of which, in fact, was appropriate enough. Apartfrom cooking game in a variety of ways and making endless pots of duck-liver pate he had one culinary accomplishment. He could make delicious fritters from dates. Never have I been able to get anyone else to produce anything 1 i ke them . y In spite of the delights of date fritters, life in Seistan was fairly stark, and it wasn't difficult to understand why the pandits of the Foreign and Political Department were reluctant to recruit junior officers who were married.61 /'*■% He conducted me to a new two-storied house standing back from the road 1n the middle of a flat and otherwise uninhabited valley It was the residence and headquarters of the civil official in charge of the district, and in an upper room I found a party of Persians about to partake of a sumptuous meal, which they invited me to share. J It transpired that a stocky, bleary-eyed, unshaven character was the outgoing Governor in the process of handing over to his successor. The handing-over seemed to consist of a recital of the names and vital statistics of all the ladies of easy virtue in the district, and everyone except the outgoing Governor (whom we later nick-named the Bashi Bazouq) showed signs of embarrass ment. However this was easily overcome as the vodka had obviously been flowing copiously for some time. In reply to tactful enquiries as to whether I had permission for my journey, I was able to produce a document which I had fortunately thought to bring with me. It was, in fact, a purely formal agreement to my appointment as Vice-Consul ' issued by the Persian Foreign office as a matter of routine, but as it was signed by the Shah and called on all officials to provide me with every facility, it's effect was magical. It turned out that the Bashi Bazouq's new district was the area of Gullidaghi for which I was headed, and that he would be most grateful for a lift. I was delighted to oblige, and I couldn't have had a better guide. He was by origin an Azerbaijani Turk of ultimate Georgian ancestry and his father had been a high official in Meshed. He had received his education in Tiflis was fluent in Russian, and also spoke Turkish and the local dialect of Kurdish. He was quite untypical of a Persian official un-inhibited and prepared to forthcome on any topic, and was a mine of information on the area and the peoples who inhabited it. had &gt; he claimed, let his standards slip somewhat after losing three of his sons inside one week from some epidemic or other (there was no reason, of course, to believe that his story was true); and, anyway, need fear no-one, because in his position as an administrator of the Shah's estates, there was only one superior between himself and the Shah, whereas there would be several in the case of the ordinary district officer. The whole area of Gullidaghi, he explained, was Crown Property and he was in charge of it. And in charge of it he was collection of hovels at the trying to settle cultivators some altercation, the upshot ordered one villager to be When we arived at the miserable centre of the area where he was and establish a village, there was of which was that the'Bashi Bazouq seized, thrown to the ground and flogged. It was clear, though, that more indignity than pain was inflicted; although the victim's yells would have been appropriate to the most exquisite refinements of Torquemada.62 Having watched this inspiring example of summary judgement prompt sentence, and the immediate execution of it, (how I wished that a magistrate in India could have done the same thinqi) we entered a sing1 e-story thatched mud hut no different to the others, and, having taken off our shoes, sat cross-legged on the superbly carpeted floor and applied ourselves to the vodka. Presently a couple of tattered minions spread a suffra (embroidered table-cloth) over the carpet before us and placed on it an excellent meal of roast chicken and rice, the Bashi Bazouq explaining that he had it on good authority that Queen Victoria no less, had pronounced it socially permissible to eat chicken with one's fingers! Having eaten, my host prepared to stretch out where he sat (beds and bedding are superfluous where the alternative is a handwoven carpet) and pressed me to do the same. However, suspecting that emight turn out to be a heavy snorer I insisted on moving to adjoining room. ^ an Since there was no window I left a door to the outside open for air and in no time at all was asleep. But not for long : I felt cold hands creeping over my face and in an instant had seized a pair of bony wrists. In reply to my challenge a female voice answered that 'No she was not a thief, but had been invited to keep my host company overnight and had expected to find him in this room.' I directed her next door realising leave me sleeping where room for the assignation to judge by the sounds most cert ainly did! that the Bashi Bazouq had intended to we had dined and remove himself to this However all’s well that ends well, and coming from the next room this episode Early next morning, after some light-hearted banter about the contretemps of the night before, we set off for the nearby wooded hills to see what game they held. We took only a rolled up blanket and rug each and the baggage of the small party was easily carried on two pack-ponies. On the way up we were joined by Ahmed the most renowned merqyen or hunter, of the area, if 'joined 1 is the right word' • one moment he was not there, the next he was in our midst his dust-coloured felt skull-cap merging into the colour of his face and his clothes, and the background. He was a Kurd who, for much the same reasons as the Mullah Kohi, found it advisable to live in the mountains and avoid any contact with the gendarmerie. His only baggage was a rifle and a German mauser automatic pistol. Towards evening we reached the spot where we proposed to spend the night, and Ahmed and I proceeded to a near-by cliff-top to spy for game. Right on cue an Ibex scaled the cliff and stood motionless, within a few yards at the cliff-top. Never before had I seen one of these extremely wary wild goats at such close63 range and this was no moment niceties as shootable heads felled him where he stood, explaining that I had i nd i scriminate1y but that my of each species with the biggest possible could see no conceivable sense in this, pass up this heaven-sent opportunity of feeding us to be regarded as sane. to talk about such incomprehensible Meat was what was wanted and I I had spent sometime on the way up no desire to slaughter game object was to shoot only one animal horns. The company and I obviously could not all and expect The preparation of the meal was the easiest thing imaginable : a match was put to the bark of a juniper tree which, being tinder-dry, and having an oily bark, blazed u. p like a beacon When it had burnt into embers, the meat of the ibex spitted on twigs of dog-rose with tomatoes and onions, was roasted and made the most delicious Kababs. (I did my best to discourage the indiscriminate burning of junipers as these trees are very slow-growing, and the one we destroyed was probably 2,000 years old. The area is one of the largest juniper forests outside Russia and my remonstrances were regarded as more ravings of a demented F ar an g h i . ) Sitting round the embers after our meal, Ahmed rather coyly produced his mauser and asked me if I could show him how to work it. I could; but innocently enguired why he had not asked the man he got it from how to work it. At this a snigger went round the circle, and it transpired that the previous owner had been in no position to give such instructions. He and Ahmed had encountered one another at a spring in the mountains and Ahmed, anticipating that the other was very likely to shoot him, had prudently fired first. Everybody, it was explained, was very pleased because the other was a much worse outlaw than Ahmed! Surprisingly the night under the stars was utterly peaceful although the experience of being woken before dawn with a glass of vodka was a new one to me. ★★★★ * ★ ** * ★★★ One of my major concerns in making this trip was to find out what I could about the Persian Turkomans; known as the Yomut, who inhabit the area around Gumbad-i-Qa bTT s . As far as I know no Englishman had had any contact with them for very many years and they seemed to be rather an unknown guantitv in this part of Persia. It soon became clear that this was the wrong area to find out anything about the Turkomans - had one appeared he would have been shot out of hand! However I was familiar with their traditional role from the pages of 'Haji Baba of Isfahan.' They had made a practice of sending large parties (sometimes numbering several hundreds) deep into Persia to loot the towns and carry64 off the inhabitants into slavery. They had the advantage that theirhorses, bred on the fertile grass of the steppes, were far superior to any the Persians had, and their reputation for bravery and ferocity was such as to reduce their victims to a state of gibbering terror and deter them from resistance or pursuit. Indeed, not far from Gullidaghi one could still see a wide track stretching across the plain into the far distance over the Julgeh-i - Paighambar Dani a~l or 'Valley of the Prophet Dan | eT ^ which was known as the Alem'an Yoli - 'the Turkomans' Way , A1 enfSn meaning a raiding party and pronounced interesting1y - exactly as the French word for 'Germany”. Having passed my First Class Interpretership in Persian I had actually started the study of the Turkoman dialect, which I found to be close to the Uighur language spoken in Chinese Central Asia and as far east as the Kansu province of China. It was amusing to discover that the Turkoman word for a Persian was gol which means literally 'slave' - (hence cooley). — Naturally enough the Persians' feelings for the Turkomans (who compounded their other vices by being Sunni Muslims) were something less than friendly, and Riza Shah, as soon as he felt strong enough, lost no time in mounting a military expedition against them. It so happened that the Bashi Bazouq had taken part in this operation in command of a unit of mounted Kurds (to call them cavalry would be to flatter them unduly), so I was lucky to hear a first-hand account. The Shah's army, superior in numbers and with the advantage of artillery and modern weapons, made short work of the i 1 1-organised Turkomans, and any males who could be captured were slaughtered out of hand. The majority of the survivors, of course, fled into the thickets and forests where the Persians felt it unwise to follow them; and such women as were young and agile and not too encumbered with infants no doubt went with them. As for the women who could not escape - their fate was g ues s ab1e. The Persians remained in occupation of the Turkoman country for six weeks or so, and during that period there was not a female, the B.B. claimed, between the ages of eight and eighty who was not repeatedly raped. 'We changed the race' he boasted. This, of course, was nonsense : in any Muslim society of that period all girls were married at puberty, and all would be pregnant except those who were temporarily or permanently infertile. In any case a child born nine months later and suspected to be the result of rape would be destroyed at birth; and any who, for one reason or another, might escape this fate would be reared as a slave and never, under any circumstances, be accepted as a member of the tribe or allowed to marry a Turkoman woman. So the race remained unchanged.65 The sad epilogue was that Khan Junaid, the leader findinn himself surrounded in the forests and with no chance of ’survival wfth !uch of na hi e s a fnn Sh f0r the frontier and escape from Persia! with such of his followers as remained. Interestingly, althouah they could easily have reached the Russian frontier ‘ 9 fifty or sixty miles to the North, they preferred to Afghanistan six hundred miles to the east.

The scenery66 aS «.w 1nter f St t! n9 ’ the ml1e upon mile of wavin 9 g»'ass being unlike anything to be seen elsewhere in Persia; but opportunity to make contact with the people and learn something about their life and 1anguage was nil. Not far to the west of Gurgan one plunges into the dense rain forest of Mazandaran, and exploring it rather perfunctorily we came upon the unmistakable fresh pug-marks of a tiger beside a small pool. I fear that the Hyrcanian tiger must by now be almost, if not completely, extinct - most of the population being tar too intent on preserving themselves to think of preserving tigers! y Another journey of interest which I was able to make that summer was North from Quchan to the Persian/Russian frontier at Bajgiran. The road penetrates the frontier range (the Kopet Dagh) by a series of spectacular gorges fording and re-fording the shallow river, and I was able to take a number of photographs which proved of considerable interest (to people interested in such things) since the road had not been traversed by any British Officer for about 20 years. The mountains were covered with a variety of lichens which I never saw elsewhere in Persia, but are no doubt common in Central Asia. Foreigners were not allowed to travel this road without special permission. Accordingly I did not waste my time applying for permission^ but^just went. On arrival at the Persian frontier town of Bajgiran (meaning ‘customs collectors’), I was naturally detained by the police manning the post at the entrance and po itely reguested to accompany them to the Governor's office. There the somewhat dismayed governor telephoned Meshed for instructions and I was permitted to return. What else could they ^ was interesting to look down from Bajgiran over the endless expanse of the Dasht-i-Turkoman (The Turkoman Desert) stretching featureless as a vast sea into the dim distance. Only the Russian Trans-Caspian railway and the village and railway station of Ashkabad showed signs of life. The rest of the summer passed pleasantly - too pleasantly in fact, since Hitler's armies were over-running Europe, aided by saboteurs, infiltrated into the countries to be attacked in the guise of businessmen and tourists, and eguipped to seize key installations. Their success inspired Churchill to establish the Special Operations Executive, for whom I was later to work. In the autumn I took off for Birjand, and after a fortnight shooting partridges in the mountains behind the Kalateh, for Seistan. There I was only to spend a few weeks, before my protests at under-employment bore fruit, and news of my posting as Assistant Commissioner at Kohat on the North-West frontier came through. be leaving Persia with so little understanding of I felt s ad to67 the people and their interaction with the powers that governed them But the fault was not mine : Riza Shah had strictly forbidden his subjects from contact with foreigners, presumably out of fear of intrigue, though none of the British officers in East Persia whom I knew would have been capable of it, not having received any instruction in the art. However I did manage to discover that the Persian system of division of the produce of the land (the main source of wealth) was guite different from the Indian one, where the Government took a fixed percentage of the harvest as of right. In Persia, virtually no cultivation was possible without irrigation, and the provision of it by the digging and maintenance of ganTts often involved a very considerable capital investment. TKe Harvest was therefore divided into five shares, one each for the owner of the land, the provider of the water, the power (in the form of plough cattle), the seed-corn, and the labour. To what extent this traditional rule-of-thumb was still followed I cannot say but the obvious lacuna was that it left nothing for the State’ The gap was f i 1 1 ed by 'presents'. No action by the authorities could take place without an appropriate donation to the man in authority, whose superiors made certain that a suitable proportion of it was passed on to them, so that the Governor of the province achieved a considerable income. However his day of reckoning came with the visit of the Inspector from Teheran who had to be sent away satisfied if the Governor was to be continued in his office. When the Inspector returned to Teheran, of course, it was his turn. 'It is no more possible' wrote the sage 'to tell whether an official is taking bribes than to tell whether a fish is drinking water'. So the sensible thing was not to try. Although this system sounds iniguitous, it could, in fact, work guite well. If a provincial governor was unjust or over-rapacious the peasants simply removed themselves to another part of the country where the adm-i ni s tration was fairer, the land was left uncultivated and became derelict, and the income of the governor vanished. Thus it was in the interests of the ruler to keep the peasants prosperous and contented, and this the Shaukat-al-mulk, hereditary ruler of the Qainat, did. It is easy to sneer at the system I have described as venal and corrupt, and compare it with western systems where a highly-paid and impartial judiciary dispenses justice without fear or favour or thought of corrupt reward. But the idol may have feet of clay. The apocryphal story springs to mind of the British judge retiring after a life-time of devoted service in India, who was invited to a farewell dinner by his court clerk and entertained in circumstances of such dazzling splendour that it was clear, even to him, that such opulence could never have been achieved honestly. In response to his pressing enguiries the clerk replied: 'Sir, I was never dishonest. I simply accepted an envelope from each of the contestants in your court and, whenyour Honour had decided the case I returned his envelope to the ’'ht ' And what? ' said the Judge, appalled, 'did you say to him? I simply said' replied the clerk 'I am sorry. It was not enough!' Let us not be too quick to judge. The thought occurs that, whatever defects the present (1985) priestly regime in Persia may have, it has never been accused of corruption. I was intrigued to discover, on this my last visit to Birjand, that a local sir d a r had apparently solved the problem of middle age. I had never been able to visit him because of the boycott of foreigners, but had annually enquired after his health, and had annually been told 'Thank God he is well and vigorous; his eye is bright, his beard is red, he spends his days hunting’, and several sons are born to him every year' (daughters don't count!) On this occasion I was told, 'He is very old, very holy, his beard is long and white, he has divorced all his wives, and he prays five times a day!' He had progressed - in one bound - from youthful vigour to venerable sanctity, and had eliminated entirely that tiresome period - middle age.69 CHAPTER 11 Across Afghanistan ! was overjoyed. Feeling that I had learnt as much as possible headed b e ack OP t 0 o 9ra t P he y t Pe0Ple K° f Khorasan - 11 «as &lt;lood to be headed back to the frontier where there was real work to be done. To avoid retracing my steps through Zahedan and Quetta ^ hlch 1 had ent ered Persia 18 months before, I decided to travel North to Meshed and then East to Herat and if possible through Afghan Turkestan via Mazar-i-sharif and the Hindu Kush mountains to Kabul. Unfortunately it was not possible. Our Embassy at Kabul were severely restricted by the Afghans in the number of visits they were allowed to make to A^han Turk,stan and they naturally did not wish to reduce their tn n no hdrl H eS ° f getting there by asking permission for an outsider l m \ However I was keen to see Herat, and accordingly drove uo o Meshed in mid-December and took the road for Herat. It was an extremely bad road and we gradually lost height as the country became gradually more arid and desolate. ^ The frontier was marked only by a couple of mud huts (one Persian Herat' 6 Thp r' h and cross1n 9 one climbed very gradually to rh u 1 * The tr,b es-people were mostly semi-nomadic Baluchis and Chahar Aimak, the latter a tribe of Turkish Persian speaking. origin, although Herat was a disappointment, population and civilization recovered from the appalling seven centuries before.

The comnlexities of international finance delayed us somewhat in Herat. There was no bank there - or if there was it had no business contact with any bank in Meshed - and the manager of the Government Rest House in which I stayed would certainly have Inrh d l kan F5 at a Cavelier's cheque. It was unwise to carry desire C rf aS Mr ° ne 35 securit * the roads left much to be desired (it was even unwise to have a visible gold tooth as the rnrv en,e Th 0f th6 h '. 9 bway would unhesitatingly knock it out with a M?HH ' There remained the Bill of Exchange, much in use in the Middle East and known as a hundi in India, a barat in Persia and •' n u Ar t bl J a ‘ Accordingly I bought one from a Jewish in Meshed drawn on a correspondent realise (being as a child in these on seven days' sight. Not wanting a h awa*l a Merch an t fai1ed to was drawn much b arlt one in Herat, things) was to wait so What I that it long in70 Herat, I eventually had it discounted and left a little wiser than I had arrived. Without doubt, the worst way of crossing a foreign country if one wishes to make contact with the people and learn something of their way of living and thinking is in an air-liner at 30 000 feet or more, especially if you stay at any chain* of international hotels, each one identical to the last, all round the world. The next worst way is at 80+ mi 1es-an-hour on a motor way. Fortunately neither of these options was open to me and I headed south for Kandahar planning to cover 400 miles of unmetalled road in a day. This, it turned out, was wildly over- optimistic although in ideal conditions it might have been possible. The road from Herat to Kandahar curves around the foot-hills of the mountains of Ghor on the left while to the right lies lower flatter country, and every so often it crosses a nullah or normally dry river-bed. However as we left Herat it started to rain steadi]y, persistently, and doggedly, and the nullahs began to flow. At first they were merely inches deep and one could drive through without difficulty. Then they began to carry a foot or more of water and it became advisable to take off one's shoes and socks and wade through to test the depth. This became tedious when repeated every mile or so, also time-consuming, and it soon became obvious that we had no chance of reaching Kandahar by night fall. Inevitablyimpatience overcame discretion, and I drove into a stream, which turned out to be deep enough to flood the engine and stop the C3r - There was nothing to be done except to wade not without difficulty, to the bank, sit down, and watch the water rise. Fortunately it was not long before a bus arrived and the passengers , manfu1ly dismounting, put their shoulders to the car and pushed it to the bank. We spent a most unpleasant night with only the remains of our day's provisions to eat and no prospect of early rescue, as the rain prevented any further lorries or buses from travelling. The morning dawned clear but cold and the rain had stopped, but the rivers were still high enough to inhibit further transport from trying the road. The problem of food was solved by two passing shepherds who sold us (yes, sold! Sher Oil was appalled by such lack of traditional Muslim hospitality) some coarse flour. This we kneaded into dough with water from the stream and wrapped about half an inch thick round a stone the size of a grape fruit, which had been heated in the fire we had built. It was then put back in the fire and the ashes raked over it. The result was what the locals called Nan-i-Kakh , and not to be recommended to any but those with extremely strong teeth and a71 readiness to consume a certain amount of wood-ash with their meal. During the morning a party of tribesmen came by and, as is the custom, seated themselves round in a circle for an exchange of news and views. They were Durranies, of the tribe which supplied the ruling dynasty of Afghanistan, and were fine-looking men, tall with hair neatly trimmed at the level of their ears, black beards, large white turbans and smocks coming below their*knees. They did not carry rifles as frontier tribesmen would have done.* Their curiosity was insatiable. 'Are you married?' they asked me • 'No.' 'Why not?' 'In my country getting married isn't simply a question of paying over the bride-price to the girls' father, she has to like you and agree to marry you.' 'What if none of them like you? Will you get yourself a boy?' (At this outspoken and uninhibited question poor Sher Dil was deeply embarrassed, for he knew the laws of British India and the prejudices of the British). I knew that talk about laws and personal disinclination would be incomprehensible, so simply replied 'It's against my religion.' There was some shaking of heads at the thought of such a perverse dogma but my explanation was accepted. Before they left they imparted the information that there was an encampment about^ a mile further down the road and that the head-man had a 9 0 a ^ weans of which he could communicate with Far ah (the next village) or even Kandahaj^. I had no idea what a 9 p sh ak was, but the Persian for ear is Gush and I set off to put the head-man to the test. He was a “TTaTuchi and one of the hairiest men I have ever seen (in fact, he wouldn't have disgraced a pop-group). The hair on his head came down to his shoulders, and his beard merged into the forest on his chest. However he^dived into his black goats-hair tent and, emerging w i th the 9° s h ak &gt; shinned up a telegraph pole and, attaching two wires to the lines, began to yell 'Wa Parah!' into his instrument. To my surprise he was soon through to Farah and passed on my S.O.S. In due course a lorry arrived and, with the help of two planks and the horde of on lookers/passengers who inevitably gathered^, the car was man-handled into the lorry and transported to Farah. There it was soon covered by a swarm of very oily men, much as a dead animal is covered by an army of ants, and by a rather similar process, was in no time at all reduced to its component parts which were spread out in the sun to dry. During the process I recalled that I had had trouble with the ignition on the road between Meshed and Herat, and had somehow or other managed to put it right by inserting a folded visiting-card into the electrical mechanism, and it occurred to me that this vital piece of diplomatic pasteboard must certainly have been soaked and this might well have caused the failure of the car to re-start after its immersion.

However I had for a long time tried to study the deportment and behaviour of Pathans and thought I was fairly au fait. In addition, apart from a good command of colloquial Pashtu (I had passed the highest examination in the language), I knew that my Persian was good enough to convince any Pathan or Indian that it was my mother tongue.

A few days of this and I had enough confidence to take the train to Peshawar, where the city was full of Pathans, very many of them Afridis. j j Nobody in the crowded trains spared a second-glance for a surly and taciturn Pathan and indeed one was treated with considerable respect. Sitting squeezed up against two young Sikhs in the inevitably crowded third-class compartment, I was somewhat puzzled by their cryptic conversation until one of them produced a Communist broad-sheet written in Gurmukhi; the other had a list, in the same script, of names, addresses and sums of money. * It was obvious that they were Communist workers and, as at the time Russia was still in league with Germany, I judged that the Police would be interested to know about them. I took the list from the pocket of the man next to me but, reflecting that the Police might wish to find it on him for use as evidence, replaced it. At the next station I got out and, while the train was waiting, had time to telephone the Intelligence Bureau in Peshawar and rejoin the train. However, as luck would have it, the man with the list in his pocket got out at the next station! A Pathan police inspector in plain clothes got into the carriage one stop short of Peshawar and we entered into conversation. Fortunately he spoke Persian, and we were able to converse without any likelihood of anyone else in the carriage being able to understand. At the t i cket-barr i er in Peshawar the man was stopped and the communist literature found inside his jumper. He was led away, but I never heard what further action was taken or whether his colleague was apprehended. Special rules governed tribesmen staying in Peshawar and they were required to spend the night in Serais where several hundred would sleep on string beds in a large dormitory, and where their names and tribal particulars were recorded on entry. This presented no problem as I had my answers ready, but an embarrassment was that the occupant of the next bed was a young Tirah Afridi, fortunately from a different tribe from the one to which I claimed to belong. He was inquisitive and friendly and insisted that I should return to my village and claim my share of the tribal 'allowances' (sums of money paid to the elders in consideration of the good behaviour of the tribe, and shared among all members). This, of course, I had no intention of doing . An interesting angle arose in the discussion of my supposed employment as the personal servant of an Englishman. 'Of course,' said my friend 'You don't tell him the truth!' I happened to know the head of the Intelligence Bureau in Peshawar from Quetta days. He was 'Father' (so called because his hair was prematurely white) Wood, and the only man to suspect my bona fides was his Afridi orderly. However I brazened it outr , \ and was able to give 'Father' a certain amount of information which he found of interest. Peshawar City was fascinating. The streets teemed not only with indus, Sikhs, and Panjabi Mussalmans, but with Afghans, Hazaras, Chitralis, Kashmiris, and even Kazakhs from Central Asia. Loud-speakers played the Z ak hm i S and arr a endlessly and nothing else. It is a love-song o~f which the words are alleged (by the English) to go 'There's a boy across the river with a bottom like a peach, but alas I cannot swim!' A horrifying sight was the prostitutes, who would sit at their upper windows at night heavily made-up and discreetly illuminated; but when they came down to the street in the morning to do their shopping, they all revealed themselves to be hideously old women! It was possible to imagine that boys across rivers might be positively desirable by comparison. After a few days of this I made my way back to Lahore and Kenneth Hendersons's house - to the utter amazement of his servants - and resumed my own identity. It was then time to take up my post as Assistant Commissioner in Kohat where I was rewarded by overhearing one of the locals whisper to another 'By Allah! How he speaks Pashtu!' ★★★ * **** My Deputy Commissioner was one Mahbub Ali Khan, a Pathan promoted from the Provincial Civil Service, extremely fat, wily and experienced in all the ins and outs of Frontier administration, but he did not like witnessing executions. This duty (there had to be a magistrate present) he deputed to me » dn d I to turn out before dawn to watch convicted murderers receive their just deserts. The procedure was that, at first light, the condemned man would be escorted from his cell by half a dozen policemen and stood on the trap-door in the presence °f a small party, including the Jail Superintendent, Doctor religious guide, and the Magistrate. If a Moslem, he would say a last prayer with all the ritual obeisances; if a Sikh, he was more likely to shout religious slogans. He was then hooded and noosed, the signal given, the lever pulled, he disappeared through the trap-door, and the rope was suddenly taut. The local hangman must have been an expert for I never saw so much as a twitch from the body hanging at the end of the rope. All the same it was a chilling procedure relect that, not only had the man been right of appeal against sentence, but might well be the only way of stopping lead to countless further murders. and it was comforting to duly convicted with the that his extermination a blood-feud which could 7576 The belief seems to be held nowadays in the West that no man who commits murder can be entirely sane, and that a carinq society should not extinguish him but give him psychiatric treatment until he is restored to normality. I am not so sure. In fact, on the Frontier, perfectly sane and normal men committed the vast majority of the murders, and I have no doubt that prompt capital punishment was the right treatment for them. For instance , near1y ten years later when, after partition, I was the last British Political Agent in Loralai in Baluchistan, a man was brought before me in court accused of murder. The facts were not in dispute, nor was the crime denied. He was perfectly sane and normal, no better and no worse than the rest of his fellow - tribesmen, yet he had committed what one might call an 'impulse murder’ and mindlessly, wantonly, taken the life of another. The two families to which they belonged had been at feud for many years but, after prodigious efforts on the part of the authorities aided by the Mullahs, they had been brought together and the score of murders, wo undings, rapes, abductions and thefts had been added up and priced according to an A sum of money had been handed over by the to have committed the worse mayhem, and both on the Qor an that the feud was at an end and no existed between them.

The D.C. put me sub-divisions to the east of the district which were populated by Khattak tribesmen. in charge of two towards the Indus. They were aboriginal Pathans whose roots go back a long way into history and who are chiefly distinguished by having produced the pre-eminent Pashtu poet, Khushhal Khan, and the majority of the stokers on the old coal-fired P&amp;O liners. They were a people with minimal education, somewhat short on wit and but robust, tall, and good-looking - and they knew it. simple humour As we77 were sitting on the verandah of a village house on the crest of a ridge overlooking a stupendous view of the Indus plains thousands of feet below us, one of their maliks remarked ,'Black people live down there!' and it was quite clear from the tone of his voice what he thought of 'Black people'. • I was at the time translating from Persian into Pashtu - in the hope of improving my command of the language, and possibly of doing something to break down the exaggerated awe in which the priesthood were held - a well-known satirical book lampooning an an asinine Mullah, called 'Mullah Nasr-ud-din' , and told one of the stories from it to a Khattak Malik . The story related how the Mullah, on a journey, felt thirsty, and taking off his cloak, draped it over his donkey's pack-saddle and went down to the stream for a drink. When he returned his cloak had disppeared, where upon he said to the donkey 'Since you have lost my cloak. I'll wear your pack-saddle (a we 11-under stood symbol of degradation) until you get it back', this reaction being quite in keeping with tribal ideas of tit-for-tat justice. The malik looked at me very straight and solemn and said simply, 'I don't believe its true!' The military operations in Waziristan against the Faqir of Ipi and his followers (which had started over the abduction of a Hindu girl) were still in progress, and some of the Khattak villagers from my area were believed by the police to have paid visits to Waziristan to fight with the rebel forces. One very hot afternoon upwards of thirty of them were arraigned in my court under the Frontier Crimes Regulation, and I had to demand from each of them a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of six months, with two sureties in the sum of RsSOO each. Then, in every case, the security was rejected and the men led off to prison. This was not justice and I hated doing it - there was only the word of the Police against the flat denials of the accused - but times were desperate and desperate measures were needed. Things were worse elsewhere. A friend of mine found himself in charge of a district in the Panjab where law and order had almost broken down. Finally a party of Sikhs entered the house of a woman living alone, whose husband they suspected of being an informant, strung her young son up to the ceiling by his feet and chopped him in two from bottom to top with their swords in the presence of his mother. Although everyone in the village knew perfectly well who they were, there were no witnesses - nobody was prepared to admit to having seen anything or recognised anybody. No prosecution was possible in the absence of evidence, but the rules governing excise raids were somewhat laxer, and one was duly organised. The police seized the culprits and dealt with them as they deserved. Litigious to the end, they filed a case against the police and swore that the Deputy Commissioner stood by, heating irons in the fire and passing them to the police who then applied them to the soles of their feet. The Chief Justice, an eminent Q.C. from London, threw the case out remarking that the allegations against the D.C. were preposterous and quite78 i ncredib1e. story gave me Chief Justice exceptionally They were, in fact perfectly true!

Bushire and that was with the never-ending the end of prob1ems of80 CHAPTER 13 E n g u1 fed Bus hire could not by any stretch of the imagination be considered an improvement on Kohat, nor on any of the previous places to which I had been sent. The scenery had little to be said for it, and the climate less. Ships anchored about five miles off-shore[ because there was no depth of water , and passengers and cargo were ferried in launches and lighters to a tumble-down jetty and a drab, mud-built port, standing on a flat desert promontary. About twenty miles inland could be seen the foot-hills of the mountains which guarded the plateau of Iran. It was a drive of about five miles over unmetalled roads to the Political Residency, a large, veranda-ed mansion in which my chief. Sir Geoffrey Prior, lived, and in one of the many spare rooms of which I was to be accommodated. It must have been the most pretentious building in South Persia but stood incongruously, in the middle of nothing. To the Persians it was merely the residence of the British Consul-General, for they recognised no such being as the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In fact, they had right on their side, and at the end of the war the Political Residency was translated, rather unwillingly as there was no accommodation for it, to Bahrain. The set-up originated in the Eighteenth century but came into its own with the occupation of Bushire by British forces in a brief war with Persia in the mid-nineteenth century. Subseguently the weakness of the Qajar Shahs meant that there was virtually no effective government in South Persiai and in 1 907 Britain and Russia agreed to divide the country' into 'spheres of influence'. It was considered desirable to balance Russia's influence in the North with a British Presence in the South : then, in the First World War, The German Consul in Bushire, Wassmus, took to the hills and succeeded in creating such mayhem amongst the Tangistani and Oashgai tribes that the best part of a division of British Indian forces had to be landed to keep order, and the South Persia Rifles raised into the bargain. Bushire was at the centre of all this and, in addition, was the main trading port in South Persia until Shah Riza opened the Trans-Irani an Railway in the 1930's. This terminated at Khorramshahr and virtually all the trade of Bushire transferred itself there. By the 1940's the port had virtually died, and the central government was in firm control of the tribes of South Persia; but the Political Residency continued there in spite of the lackof a raison d'etre. vThe P.R. supervised consulates at Khorramshahr, Bushire, Kirman. Bandar Abbas, of which that at Khorramshahr was the only one oT any importance, owing to the large numbers of British and Indian subjects employed at the Abadan o i 1-refinery. He had a pleasant summer residence at Shiraz 6,000 ft up on the Persian plateau.81 On the Arab side of the Gulf he controlled the Political Agents in the Arab states of Kuwait, Bahrain, and Muscat, and, through the P.A. at Bahrain, the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast stationed at Sharjah. I found my duties as Under-Secretary neither difficult nor interesting and employed myself in learning Arabic - which was both. The language was extensively used on the Persian coast as was Persian on the Arab coast - indeed the two peoples were inter-mingled although still distinct. One of the prominent tribes in Pars was the Khamseh ('Five' in Arabic, from the number of its sections) and they had, after hundreds of years of residence, become Persian speakers and Shia. The biggest tribe was the Qashqai who were Turks and still spoke a dialect of Turkish. These tribes were semi-nomadic and suffering from the efforts of the government to settle them in villages. I say 'suffering' advisedly because their traditional economy was based on their herds of sheep and goats. These they moved up the mountains in the spring and summer, following the melting snow, to graze them on the lush grass, and down to the littoral plains in the winter where it was comparative1y warm and there was still some verdure. They did not take kindly to being told to build villages and live in them and watch their flocks starve : but settled villagers were much more easily controlled and taxed. The Persian empire of Darius and his successors, whose armies conquered the Middle East and penetrated as far West as Greece, wasbased on a similar economy, and it is undoubtedly the most efficient way of utilising the meagre resources of such an area. Inter-tribal fighting was a thing of the fairly recent past, but when it had existed it had been conducted in a typically Persian and sophisticated manner. The two sides would mass their forces and menace each other, proclaiming their unshakeable determination to die to the last man; but, before resorting to such desperate expedients, a pause would take place during which both sides would busy themselves with intensive reconnaissance and spying. Once it was established which side was superior in numbers and weapons, and proceeding from the premise that all Persians are equally valiant, the weaker side would quietly withdraw and disperse. Only hot-headed imbeciles, like Turks, they explained, would fight when out-numbered and out-gunned! However accidents would occasionally take place, and a Church Missionary Society doctor in Shiraz told me of a tribesman coming into the hospital with a three-foot -1ong ramrod through his head, one foot of it projecting from the exact middle of his forehead and the rest from the back. He complained of a head-ache! Apparently the ram-rod had penetrated betwen the two halves of the brain without damaging either. One couldn't help marvelling at the marksmanship of his opponent who, out of ammunition, had in desperation fired his ram-rod at the enemy with such remarkable accuracy.82 The C.M.S doctors laboured selflessly to bring medical care to the people, but occasionally found themselves tripped by Persian medical ethics based on the principle that, if the patient dies, the doctor must be to blame. Not long before, one of them had treated a woman whose case turned out to be hopeless. Having done his best, he told her to return to her village and await the will of God, and in due course she died. The relatives demanded compensation from the doctor which he indignantly refused (her treatment had, of course, been free), and they brought a case against him in the local court. The case dragged on for months : no evidence was recorded and the complainants frequently changed their story : the judge smoked opium and went to sleep during the hearings : finally in desperation the doctor employed a lawyer. A few days later he found a radiant lawyer beaming on his doorstep. 'Its all settled, doctor - the most successful case I have ever handled!' 'How can it be settled? There hasn't been a hearing since you took the case.' 'But it is, and most satisfactorily - you have only to pay them one hundred tomans and they will drop it!' The poor doctor was shattered at the proposition that he should pay over money when he was quite blameless; and left the country never to return. The result of these ethics was that no Persian doctor would take on a hopeless case. In Bushire a man whose leg had been bitten off by a shark was carried to a doctor’s door. The servant who answered it told the party to wait outside and disappeared within. The doctor enquired from him whether the leg had been severed above or below the knee and how badly the man was bleeding. On hearing that the leg had been bitten off above the knee and that the victim was bleeding profusely the doctor sent the servant back to say that he was out! Not surprisingly the Residency had its own doctor on the staff. Apart from the members of the Residency, the only British in Bushire comprised the Bank Manager and three or four employees of Cable and Wireless who manned the Bushire Relay Station of the Indo-European Telegraph. In spite of being so few and so hot we played vigorous tennis on baked mud courts and there was even a rudimentary golf-course beside the Residency. It was driving over this course one evening in search of fresh air that I came on an agitated shepherd who told me that a pair of wolves had just killed two of his sheep. I turned the car and was back within 5 minutes with my rifle, only to find that the wolves had vanished and all that remained of the sheep was eight feet on the blood-stained sand. It brought home the aptness of the phrase 'to eat like a wolf'! ★ ★ ★83 In June the Nazis hurled their armies at their erstwhile allv Russia. This changed everything in the Middle East. The Persians were cock-a-hoop that Hitler was about to destroy their hereditary enemy and no doubt march on to eliminate the secondary enemy British India. The Iraqis and Syrians felt much the same. The Germans in Greece were already fairly close and their aircraft began to land in Syria where the Vichy French were sympathetic. Nazi propaganda rose to a crescendo and it was all too much for the Iraqis. In July their army, on the orders of Rashid 'll i al Gailani, attacked the R.A.F. base at Habbania and a Brit i sh-Indian army was landed at Basra to relieve it. By chance I was in Bahrain officiating as Assistant Political Agent while the incumbent of the post was on leave, and was lucky enough to encounter Brigadier Tony Boyce on his way to take over as Director of Intelligence with the forces in Iraq. I had known him previously when he was head of the Intelligence Bureau in Quetta, and it wasn't many days before orders came through for me to return to military duty and join our forces in Iraq. This was what I had been trying to achieve for the last 18 months, and I wasted no time in heading North through Shiraz Isfahan, and Kermanshah to report to Baghdad HQ. On arrival I was taken to Bill (later Field-Marshall Lord) Slim to brief him onwhat he might expect if he had to move his army into Iran - which indeed he had to do very soon after, moving up the same road down which I had just come. y m e Sadly, this meant farewell to Sher Oil. He was no longer young and it had been some years since he had seen his village and family : but after nine years it was sad to see him go - a loyal and faithful servant if ever there was one. It had been decided that no self-respecting army could operate without S.O.E. (Special Operations Executive), and to this I was posted under the command of Lt-Col. Vivian Davidson-Houston who was forming the Middle East Branch and who happened to be one of the few Mandarin-speaking officers in the army. (I am sure this was incidental and not the main reason for his posting!). We had no role while the area was occupied by Allied Forces, and our brief was to investigate the possibility of organising sabotage and guerilla activity in the event of the Germans occupying the country after a successful advance through Russia. It seemed that the most likely terrain was the mountainous country of Pusht-i -Kuh lying along the frontier of Iraq and Persia. The only Wester ner who had travelled extensively in it was Freya Stark who was also working for the Intelligence in Baghdad. I called on her, but did not glean much beyond what she had already published in her books about her travels. What she had to tell84 me was not particularly encouraging : the Lur tribe who inhabited the area were extremely impoverished; had been largely disarmed by Riza Shah; and bore an unenviable reputation for treachery, thievery, and general untrustworthiness. There was, I felt, nothing to be gained from wearing uniform, living in a military camp, and working in an Army Office, so I maintained my civilian exterior and found my own accommodation in Baghdad, which was infinitely more interesting than an Army mess and far more beneficial to my Arabic. However it was felt that Basra would be a better base from which to operate and, after a few days, I set off there by car, ostensibly as Vice-Consul. Whereas, when travelling in Persia, it was possible, if one couldn't reach one's planned destination, to pull off the road and sleep in the desert, this could not be done in Iraq as the first party of Arabs to come by would murder one as a matter of course. I was slightly incredulous about this but nevertheless spent the night in an Arab Hotel in Hilla where the sanitary arrangements were the most unspeakable I have ever encountered. Later, when a German prisoner-of-war camp was established near Basra, security, I discovered, was greatly facilitated by the fact that any escapers were invariably murdered before they had travelled more than a few miles. ★ ★ ★ The German d r ang n ach o s t en was meanwhile proceeding apace and, as their armies daily drew nearer to the Middle East, the excitement mounted. It was vital that the Allies should open a supply route to Russia with which the Germans could not effectively interfere, and the obvious route was through Persia. There were significant numbers of Germans in Persia on various pretexts, and, in the light of experience in Europe, it was obvious that they would actively intervene on a given signal when Nazi forces were approaching the frontier. The Allies therefore demanded that the Shah should expel the Germans. This was a demand to which no Moslem ruler could possibly accede; the protection of the stranger within one's tent is an almost sacred obligation; and the Shah accordingly refused. One can not help feeling a certain degree of sympathy for him in the circumstances; but on the pretext of this refusal the allies decided to occupy Persia. The Russians steam-rol1ered their way in from the North through Azerbaijan and also East of the Caspian into Khorasan (though this move had not, I believe, been agreed with their allies): Bill Slim launched his attack up the passes to Hamadan; and C.O. Harvey commanded the invasion of Khorfamshahr and Abadan from Basra. Persian resistance was fanatical and even heroic in patches but generally ineffectual : the Shah rang the Amir Shaukat-u1-mu 1k and asked him 'Do you think the Russians will spare my life?' : 'I doubt it' said the Amir, where upon the Shah/ \ surrendered to the British, abdicated, and was exiled to M a u r i t i u s . Later I asked a Russian officer in Meshed how the fighting had gone and he replied dourly 'No glorious deeds were done that day.' Verb Sap . Having arrived in Basra the day before, I had gone to make my number with the General the very morning of the invasion. We could clearly hear the bombardment, but he, having set it all in motion, had nothing to do until reports began to come in, so we spent the morning playing billiards! * ★ ★ After a few weeks in Basra it became clear that my activitives were doing little to further the war effort, and that I might be more usefully employed in Khorasan where I was more familiar with the country and the people. Accordingly, I was transferred, ostensibly as Vice-Consul, to Meshed and set off to drive the length of Persia accompanied by a young Iraqi Kurd whom I had engaged in Baghdad as a driver. We spent a few weeks in Teheran so that I could acquaint myself with my colleagues and the organisation there, and then headed East through the depths of the Persian Winter for Meshed. It was so cold crossing the Elburz mountains that the car engine froze up while we went into a tea-house for a quick cup of hot tea. While we were unfreezing it the Kurd, announcing that he could stand no more and wished to die, lay down in the snow. I had to slap him to bring him to his senses and this was the only time in all my service in the East that I struck an Oriental. 8 5CHAPTER 14 Cloak and dagger Almost certainly my cover was 'blown' within days of my arrival, when the Indian Head Clerk of the Consulate-General asked me for my last pay certificate'. This was a document which, under the rules of the Government of India, an officer transferred to a new post had to produce to show his rate of pay in his last post and the date up to which he had received it. I had to reply that I had none as I was being remunerated from another source. On top of this it must soon have been clear that little of the regular work of a vice-consul was passing across my desk while most of my time was spent on trips into the mountains, ostensibly for shooting. One hopes it was not so but I have little doubt that word reached the Persians, the Russians, and even possibly the Germans, that Tandy was not a legitimate Vice-consul The Germans were represented by a trade mission who were mainly engaged in buying nuts and dried fruit for export to Germany. We had them well sewn up because they employed an Indian clerk who kindly informed us of the price at which they had been authorised to buy (they were very strictly controlled from Berlin); we passed on the information to the Jewish merchants who saw to it that the local price rose beyond this level, and the Germans had to telegraph Berlin for permission to buy at the higher price and so on . * Some months later I had occasion to discuss with my Russian colleague the possible source of the pro-Axis rumours which were persistently circulating in Meshed. I mentioned that it might be worthwhile keeping a watch on the contacts of a German couple, of whom the husband was a doctor employed in the local Persian hospital. I emphasised that I had no definite proof (obstensibly he was a refugee as his mother was Jewish), but nevertheless they were never seen again, and the next morning a Russian officer was in occupation of their house. I was reluctant to exchange information with the Russians after this, especially as there was never any reverse flow. * ★ ★ The first few months were passed in renewing contacts with the tribes and the outlaws in the mountains towards the Caspian where sites for caches of armes, ammunition, and explosives had to be selected and 'dead-letter boxes' chosen, although nothing could be placed in position until the last possible moment. I was pleased to find that security had deteriorated to the point where the mountains were roamed by armed desperadoes, many of them Russian deserters, whose lives were forfeit should they ever be captured by anybody. Unfortunate1y I had to conclude that 86 .87 they would be unsuitable for guerilla operations. It was a question of motivation. Having deserted from the Russian Army they would certainly face death if re-captured by the Russians, and the same if captured by a putative German army of occupation, or for the matter of that if captured by anybody else! It did not seem that they could be inspired to throw themselves whole-heartedly into a guerilla operation. It was obvious that one had to fall back on the indigenous outlaws and bandits mostly Kurds -and in making these contacts the Bashi Bazook was 1 ntermed 1 ar y • His employment as an admi n i s t r ator of the Shah s estates had come to an end with the abdication and he was living on the produce of his property, mostly vineyards and orchards of apples, pears, pomegranates, peaches and almonds, but naturally glad to see some cash come in from wherever. He had broken open the walls in which he had hidden his arms and ammunition during the Shah's regime and was fully armed and ready to meet all comers. His house was unfurnished except for exquisite carpets on which one sat to eat, drink and sleep, and the only object hanging on the wall, now repaired after the extraction of the weapons, was a vaginal douche, more, one imagines, for convenience than ornamentation! I always took with me on a visit a case of vodka, but the Bashi Bazouk, although he lapped it up, maintained that his home-brew was far more potent; and indeed he demonstrated this by pouring some of the shop vodka into a saucer and putting a match to it. It burnt with a blue flame. Then he poured some of his D.I Y vodka into a saucer and, when he lit it, there was an explosion' I wasn’t surprised when he explained that he distilled his vodka through a rifle-barrel on which a boy kept pouring cold water Maybe there were some residues of gun-powder or other propellant in the brew. It certainly tasted like it! I was intrigued to notice that when, through some mischance, the vodka ran out, although he was always highly - and very wittily - critical of opium smokers, he would borrow some from one of our companions, slip outside, and smoke it. When vodka was available again he didn't use opium. A certain amount of ingenuity was required to circumvent the Russian road blocks which one found at the entrances and exits of towns. The Bashi Bazouk's method was 100% effective. It was to know no Russian. Although fluent in the language he would simply sit in the back of the car and shake his head, while I* Posing as his driver, would do the same. It always worked!88 Michael Hadow, later ambassador in Tel Aviv &amp; Buenos Aires, with whom I shared a house in the Consulate-General grounds in Meshed and who spoke Russian, was hard put to it on one occasion Two strange figures had appeared in his office, and when the door was shut, had announced themselves as N.C.O.s in the American Air Force. It appeared that they had been members of the Do 1 i 111 e bombing raid on the Japanese in China, and when their plane force-landed in Russia had been interned and sent to Ishqabad on the Russian-Persian border. Security had been lax (I suspect deliberately so) and they had no difficulty in escaping and making their way to Meshed at the bottom of a lorry-load of vegetables. We decided to evacuate them to India and Michael set out to drive them there in an Army 15-cwt. truck. He unloaded them short of the instructed them to walk into the cuunury omu, wnen out ot sight make a half-circle round the post and rejoin the road half a mile it. Unfotunately the officer in charge announced that he !d a lift to the next nn«;t and nrnnncoH first Russian control-post and country and, when out of sight beyond required a lift to the next post and proposed to accompany Michael in the truck! With difficulty Michael managed to persuade him that it was forbidden to carry a foreigner in a British Army Vehicle and that the penalty would probably involve a long sojourn in a concentration camp in Australia quite understood and withdrew his demand. The Russian Not long after, on returning from a visit to India I was stopped at the Russian post forty miles short of Meshed. I explained that I had telegraphed the British Consulate General in Meshed and asked them to arrange for a pass to be sent to the post from the Russian Head Quarters. He was adamant that he had received no pass and I could not proceed. A long but friendly discussion ensued during which I pointed out the columns of lorries passing thro.ugh carrying war supplies from India for Russia and he appreciative1y smoked the American cigarettes which I offered him, until finally he suggested that I should send my driver on to collect the pass and bring it back. This was progress, but I pointed out that as my driver was in experienced and the road covered with snow and ice, I would prefer to go and get the pass myself. When he agreed to this I let him have a sight of a bottle of vodka and asked 'Do I really need to come back?' When he said ’no’ we parted with the vodka and drove on. The Bashi Bazouk's method might have saved me a bottle of vodka. But it wasn't only the Russians who put obstacles in the way of travellers. Driving up to Bujnurd I found the road blocked by e ed trees and, as soon as I stopped, two Kurds in fur hats ongcoats, ^nd tall leather boots came galloping on us brandish’ng rifles. They looked like re-incarnations of Attila the Hun, and it transpired that the Zaafaranlu Kurds had risen in rebellion and were investing Bujnurd. They took me to a room89 in a nearby villaqe where the Khan was seated on a rug on the floor, and it turned out that he was a worried man. Drawn up outside was a truck with a very large safe on it. 'What do the Rules of War say?' he asked 'This safe is consigned to the manager of the bank in Bujnurd. but I am certain that it is packed with arms for the defenders, and the driver has no key. Am I entitled to detain it?' Forbearing to point out the irrelevance of the 'Rules of War' in the circumstances, I opined that no harm would be done if he held the safe until someone appeared to open it for inspection. His next question was more difficult. 'Was Mr. Churchill in favour of his rising, or not?' There was no point in telling him that Vice-Consuls in foreign parts were not empowered to state categorica 11y the views of the Prime Minister, so I suggested that, since Britain and Russia were at war with Nazi Germany, our main interest in the area was that nothing should interfere with the smooth transit of war supplies through Persia,and that for this reason Mr. Churchill would be unlikely to look favourably on local rebellions and such like disturbances. I left him looking glum and shortly after he called off his rebellion. It proved an interesting trip, because it was into mountains previously unknown to me but which were fairly central to the area in which I should have to operate. We started off on ponies which we extracted with difficulty from the Bashi Bazouk's stable. The difficulty arose because the stable had not been mucked out for months and the ponies' heads were almost touching the roof, so that we had to dig them out to get them through the door! However, the manure had been desiccated by the dry air and was quite inoffensive. The ponies, although they had not been exercised for months, carried us nobly up 3 to 4 thousand feet of mountain to a nomad camp in deep snow. The black goats-hair tent was too low to stand up in, and so full of smoke from the fire in the middle that one had to keep one's head as close to the ground as possible to breathe - and breathing involved inhaling quantities of opium smoke. The Bashi Bazouk, having plenty of vodka, amused himself by making fun of the smokers : 'The world', he told them, 'has three sorts of dog. There is the small,' squeaky, excitable sort that yaps 'duzd', duzd, duzd' (thief! thieH thief!), and the big, tough, burly dog which~'6arks 'Ku, ku, j^u ' (Where? where? where?) and finally the lean, sad, mangy opium-smoking dog, and that barks 'raft, raft, raff (Gone! gone! gone!) The smokers protested that they needed their opium and it gave them strength. 'Yes' said the B.B. 'When you've had your pipe you go wood-cutting, and you climb twice as far up the mountain as anyone else, and cut twice the load of wood : on the way down you meet a tiger, kill it with your axe and throw it up on top of the load!' 'Well...' said the smokers, looking sheepish, 'Yes, you do' said the B.B. 'but you do it all sitting down!'90 The howling of wolves, meanwhile, was very close and we had to put a guard on the horses tethered outside. The next morning at first light we saw two figures in the distance, but showing up well against the concluded that they must be Turks, crossing the their village to the south, and Ahmed, the Kurdish and looked at the B.B. for all the world like a B B. nodded, and Ahmed and one other grabbed rifles and took off after the Turks.

Shortly afterwards we made out two shadowy figures riding down the mountain out of the mist. They were wearing long leather boots, Turkoman gowns, and the high black sheepskin hats known as t a 1 p e k s , and were, of course carrying rifles. Ahmed beckoned me ' f r antic a 1ly into a thicket and whispered 'We'll crawl forward to the edge of these bushes and when they reach those rocks over there we'll shoot them!' When I insisted that such behaviour would be unbecoming to a British Consul, he said 'What else can we do? They're Turkomans'' However I insisted, and we walked up to them, appearing more confident than we felt, and greeted them. Although there were a few tense moments and some fingering of triggers, no shots were fired and we all four breathed again, sat down and made tea. We then discovered that one of them was a Persian merchant, eleven thousand of whose sheep had been rustled by the Turkomans and the other was his Turkoman escort. They had crossed the mountain to negotiate the return of the sheep with the rustlers and we should undoubtedly have felt rather foolish had we done as Ahmed suggested . The next day we managed to identify a group of 4 or 5 old rams on a high mountain pasture. (Outside the breeding season the rams separate themselves from the ewes and young). We were unable to approach within shot, and Ahmed and I had to keep them under observation from a distance for no less than three days, before we were able to approach them up wind and over dead ground, until I was in a position to shoot the one which we judged to be the biggest head. In fact, it turned out to be within one inch ofthe world record for this animal That night was an eventful one.

There I found that they were all looking in e opposite direction; for the Japanese were advancing through Burma and it seemed that they might soon be in occupation of parts of Eastern India. My superiors could hardly be less concerned about my activities in Khorasan. Meanwhile feeling grew tenser as the Germans approached the Caucasus, and it seemed inevitable that they would soon be standing on Persian soil. The Russian Consul-General drew me on one side : 'Of course, we will all come with you into the mount a! ns and join the resistance', (So much for my cover!) and an American whom I had not previously suspected of having C.I.A. connections made a similar offer. I wanted none of this, tor the effectiveness of an untrained, unfit, and ill-eguipped assortment of Russian bureaucrats would be negligible particularly in view of the Persian dislike and mistrust of Kussians. In fact, I rated my own chances of surviv a 1 as very 919? lew.

It was then the trans-Irani an railway to Khorramshahr , accompanied by a party of young Norwegians who had escaped from occupied Europe and were on their way to join the Allied forces: a night or two in Khorramshahr as the guest of Ronald Daubeny,' the Consul, and a tour of the then biggest oil-refinery in the world at Abadan - now a ruin; finally a flying-boat from Basra to Bahrain where I met my new boss. He was Teddy Wakefield (later Sir Edward Wakefield Bart. M.P.) and one of the most competent and intelligent officers in the Department, but unfortunately a new-comer to the Arab countries and unfamiliar with the Arab mentality (not that I was much more so, although my sojourn in Baghdad and Basra had given me a slight inkling and my stay in the Trucial Coast was to give me infinitely more.) There was a tendency amongst Indian Political Officers transferred from a princely state in India to an Arab Shaikhdom to fail to grasp the fundamental difference between the two. The Indian States (apart from the few maritime ones) were surrounded by British India; they had mostly been defeated at some time or other by British arms; their Rulers had been taught to play cricket and polo; and, if not educated in England, had been to a Princes' College run on British public school lines (except that the number of polo-ponies and personal retainers that pupils could bring with them was restricted!). None of this applied to the Gulf States - except that their capitals, situated on the sea-shore, were at the mercy of guns of the British Navy. The railway line from Bombay to Delhi crosses 38 state frontiers, and the line, and the enclaves set apart for the residence of railway employees, was policed and administered by the government of India. The accession of a new ruler was conditional upon the approval of the government, and his continuance in the rulership depended upon the adequacy of his administration. One political agent in the 1920s, Colonel Daly, had conceived it his duty to a Pply these principles in Bahrain and was much execrated for his pains, although in the long run his influence was probably beneficial.

Ajman, the smallest of the Trucial Shaikhdoms, had the most impressive Shaikh, while Umm- a 1-Qawa i n , the next smallest, had the fattest. Both’ places consisted of mere mud forts on the side of a creek with a cluster of houses, shops and huts around them: but Umm-a 1-Qawain had an array of old cannon beside the entrance pate. The carriages had long since rotted away so that the cannon were merely lying on the sand: but even so, I was told, it was the Shaikh's practice to load one and fire it off as a salute in honour of a visit by the Political Officer. I begged that this formality might be dispensed with! Ras - a 1-Khaimah was the greenest of the Shaikhdoms as the water-table in the valley running inland was raised by the underground run-off from the Ruu s - a 1 - Jeb“a 1 mountains bordering it to the North. As a result the thorn trees were plentiful and sheltered numbers of partridges which gave me some sport in the succeeding winter. It had also at one time been the most notorious of the pirate-lairs along the coast and had more than once been captured and burnt by punitive expeditions from India. The Shaikh put an entirely unfurnished mud cell in the fort at my disposal, but havinq my own camp-bed and bedding I was able to spend a tolerable night, fortified by the usual delicious q*uzi of a whole sheep wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in a hoTef in the ground with a fire on top. We returned, not along the coast, but inland, following the foot hills of the Hajar mountains. It was arduous driving, for we had to cross the beds of endless w?d i s, but interesting as the country was far from desert, and the wild-life was plentiful and varied. Particularly strange were the feral donkeys which, over hundreds of years, seemed to have bred out a uniform sand colour and had developed remarkable speed and wariness. In fact it was impossible to get near them without dismounting and doing an elaborate stalk, for which there was no time. The area was unmarked by boundaries between Shaikhdoms. The be^u* who roamed it were the Beni Qitab, and about mid-day we came to the tents of their Shaikh, Bin Huwaidin. He had a vast white beard and was reputed to be a hundred years old, but was remarkably vigorous and alert with all the down-to-earth outspokenness of the bedawi. The Arabic word for tribesman can best be transliterated bedawi (singular) and bedu (plural). There is no word in these parts corresponding to 'bedouin'.100 CHAPTER 16 Slavery &amp; Crockery One other important centre had to remain unvisited for the time being - Buraimi. This was a collection of oases in the hinterland, of which the principal one, al 'Ain, belonged to Abu Dhabi, while others were owned by Muscat and 'Ajman. This strange pattern had come about because the only people able to buy oases were the coastal rulers. Not only did they have the money, but they had the influence and authority over the b ed u to protect them : a merchant might have the money but Tfe wouldn't have the bedu following necessary for protection. Thus it came about that the coastal Shaikhs owned scattered enclaves in the interior which came to be considered part of their Shaikhdoms although, in fact, they were really only property investments. This made the country a complicated jig-saw pattern of enclaves belonging to different states which must have made the delineation of boundaries incredibly difficult when the likelihood of oil discoveries made that necessary. Ultimately the Arabs themselves have sorted out the problem by, in effect, pooling their oil resources and disregarding the frontiers. Another reason for visiting Buraimi was that it was reported to be the principal slave-market of the area. All negroes were looked on as slaves and the bedu felt themselves entitled to capture any that they might find wandering unprotected and sell them. One naturally felt it one's duty to discourage this by whatever moral influence one could bring to bear; but this peculiar guirk of the British did not go unexploited. Late one evening a youth - part Negro - burst into my office much out of breath and told how he had been captured by bedu and was being taken to Buraimi to be sold. They had camped for the night not far from Sharjah and he had escaped while his captors were sleeping and run all the way to my office to ask for manumission. Wishing to save him from recapture, I told him to bed down in my cook's quarter. Early in the morning, there was a commotion, and it was discovered that he had run off with all the cook's possessions! He had invented the whole tale. About this time Teddy Wakefield in Bahrain manumitted a Baluchi boy whose story was that he, with a number of others, had been bathing in the sea not far from their village (of which he didn't know the name) on the Baluchistan coast, when some Arabs had rowed ashore from their dhow anchored near-by, rounded them up, and sailed away with them. He had finally been sold to the Shaikh of Qatar who put him to herding camels. This was particularly reprehensible as the boy was a Baluchi, and not a negro, and therefore even by Arab standards could not be enslaved. Teddy employed him as a doorman and made a point of having him open the door to the Shaikh of Qatar when the latter came to call on official business. Unfortunately the boy fell a101 victim to civilisation : he was given an injection at the local hospital with an inadequately sterilised needle and succumbed to septicaemia. Had he not run away he might be happily herding camels in Qatar to this day - or, more likely, driving a taxi! Reading this at the close of the 20th century you that the British authorities should have goings-on, but it should be remembered that at the time had no right to interfere in the may be appal 1ed tolerated such British India affairs of the Shaikhs and their subjects on land. We did, in deference to world opinion, issue 'manumission certificates ' to slaves who came to the office and asked for them, but we had no treaty right to do so. (Usually this only occurred when the members of a slave family were divided up amongst the sons of a deceased owner). It was a matter of pride for slave-owners to feed and clothe their slaves well, and, as there was usually very little work for them to do, they had a fairly easy life. In fact, it was not unknown for one who had been manumitted to come to the Political Officer - after trying unsuccessfully for a few weeks to earn his living as a free man - and ask if it were possible to arrange for his return to slavery! In the end it was economics more than world opinion that abolished slavery - they just weren't worth keeping. The agreements on which the Government of India's relations with the Shaikhs were based were the Maritime Truces, started in 1835 with annual agreements that there should be no fighting at sea during the four months of the pearl-diving season. In 1843 these were replaced by a 10 year truce ; and in 1853 by a Perpetual Truce, and from being known as 'the Pirate Coast' the area was renamed 'the Trucial Coast.' The Rulers had also agreed not to transport slaves by sea and to have no dealings with foreign powers. Apart from that they could do what they liked, and the Government of India had absolutely no desire to increase its involvement or committments in the area. But we had, as a result of the war-time shortages, become inescapably involved with the supply of essential food-stuffs to the Gulf States. They were 'under our shadow' and we could not see them starve. However we felt no such obligation to the Persians on the other shore of the Gulf, with the result that the price of tood-grains, sugar, and tea on the Persian shore was several times that on the Arab Shore. The temptation to smuggle it over to Persia and sell it for a vast profit was obvious and we simply hadn't the administrative staff to see that this was prevented Ihe Khan Sahib had organised a system (and I take off my hat to him for doing it) whereby every single shopkeeper on the coast sent in a monthly return - hand written in Arabic - of all his sales of 'rationed' foods.CHAPTER Shir az 17 In the month of July I was allowed This was an admirable institution which permitted an officer in a hot his heavier files and. if to of and necessary. hill-station for It did not count and not deeming repair to Shiraz, the city of poets and weeks rest, recuperation and cool air. a month or two in the as leave.

This little incident seems to me to give fundamental difference between Semite specifically Arab and Persian - thinking bottom of the great schism in Islam between an insight into thi and Aryan - an&lt; , which lies at thi Sunni and Shi'ah . Th( flrxh wer e basically democratic : the Persians monarchic Th Arab tradition was to elect their leaders, choosing no ahlext a th6 S ° n ° f 3 dead Shaikh to succeed him but th ablest and wisest of his family or circle. The Persia tradition, in contrast, was one of hundreds of years o hereditary monarchy, and the divine afflatus was held to pas Mnh a er J t ° h ' S S ° n ° r nearest i-elative. When the prophe Mohammed ay dying, he said to his closest disciple, Abu don t feel able to lead the prayers tonight, you go and me (or words to that effect). When the prayers were over th prophet was dead. Accordingly, his followers naturally succeed him. This seemed all wrong to the left no son, but his daughter, Fatima, was married 1 All, and to the Persians it seemed obvious that th should have passed to him. From this feelina great schism arose.

And perhaps it rises to the surface of her consciousness, when an Arab lady finds herself confronted with an apparently unguarded pile of lovely undies on a Marks &amp; Spencers counter! In May 1944 came the pleasant surprise of home leave, just in time to escape the rigours of another summer in the Persian Gulf. It entailed an exceedingly uncomfortable journey to Cairo, sitting on a drum of petrol in an R.A.F. transport plane, and a delay of more than a week there while waiting for onward sea transport . The less said about the journey home the better : we were four to a cabin, and the man in the bunk below me had about thirty years army service and appeared not to have changed his socks since the day he was recruited : my suitcase was rifled in the unloading at Greenock and my best suit of clothes (irreplaceable in war-time) was stolen. I found my mother sadly aged in the nine years since I had last seen her and disorientated by the death of my father and that of my brother - killed in action in the Western desert. War-time living conditions in England were uncomfortable in the extreme; but out of all these tribulations there came forth bliss. At a dance at Rhodes House in Oxford I met her; and in a few weeks we were engaged. No words could describe my sensations and emotions : or rather there are plenty of words but they have all been used far too often!108 CHAPTER 18 Kuwait After a winter, Po1itic al Agent, Political Agent. i n ch arge of the pieasant Bahr ain , It was s omet hin g , relations, not on ly foreign affairs to the Mub arak had, in fact, British Protectorate but British protected state' enough but unexciting, as Assistant news came of my posting to Kuwait as at the age of 32, to be put with the Government of India of an independent (well, position of this degree of expected until one was well local rank of major and was same as that of the Shaikh) semi-independent because in signed an exclusive treaty Government binding himself not to give, sell, or territory to any other power and to entrust*his but with the rest of the world, semi-independent) Arab state, for a responsibi1ity could not normally be into one's forties. I was given the entitled to a salute of 11 guns (the on official Naval visits. Kuwait was the early 1900's Shaikh Mubarak had with the British lease any of his management of the British Government, asked that his state should become a this was not acceded to and it was 'a but not a British Protectorate! I made my way there by flying to Basra, and there boarding the agency launch and making the 100 mile journey down the Shatt Al Arab and across the open sea. We arrived at dawn to see a low mud-built town stretched along the sea-shore. There were hardly any buildings of more than one storey, and prominent among the 1 arger ones were the Political Agency and the Shaikh's pal ace at the eastern end of the town The Agency had offices on the ground floor and living guarters above, consisting of a large drawing-room, dining-room, study and four bed rooms each with a bath-room with - for the first time in my service the marvel of water-borne sanitation! There was a minimum of furniture, mercifully no telephone, electric light and fans (but no air-condition i ng); however the house was built in the shape of a new moon with the concave side facing North-west so as to capture as much as possible of the relatively cool North-west wind. In fact it amounted to much more palatial accommodation than any I had previously been privileged to occupy. a As it was spring, the Shaikh and all the notables were out camping in the desert to enjoy for a few weeks the brief flush of grass and wi1d-f1owers , drink fresh camel's milk, and make believe they were bedu again. They weren't, of course. Only a small minority of the population could trace an authentic desert origin. The majority had immigrated from Persia (whither, guite possibly their forbears had migrated originally from the Arab 3 h ore) Iraq, Nejd, (the heart-land of Saudi Arabia) and Syria. hat had brought them to Kuwait was the opportunity for trade in a - more or less - free port,within easy smuggling distance of Iraq, Persia, and Saudi Arabia.109 Jn!h!i/ ere K t r° ‘ ndi 9 enous Arab Tribes, the 'AwTzim and the Rush a id a nho lived along the coast in mean, mud-built villaoes and eked out an existence on fish and an exiguous supply of inferior dates They were not highly regarded in the pecking order of Arab tribes, since they were sedentary and owned practically no camels. But at that time of year there were several of the a s i 1 or noble Arab tribes camped in the desert such as the Ajmah and the Beni KhaTlid from the South, the Beni Harb from the Hejaz on the far side of Arabia, and Mutair from There were also the Muntafiq who were Shia' and cultivated crops along the rivers and lake shores of Southern Iraq. They were not, strictly speaking, nomads and owned no camels but brought their large flocks of sheep to graze the spring grass in e Kuwait desert, where they sheared the sheep and sold the wool in the large wool-market of Kuwait. In April they would return c? kk? Q h , a u rvest their ^ops and put the sheep to graze on the stubble for the summer. The camels and sheep would put on reserves of fat in the spring: the camels in their humps (which grew vast) and the sheep on thenr tails In the summer the camels had to be concentrated on the few wells and their humps vanished by the autumn, as did the tails of the sheep. The only possible chance the indigenous Arab had of earning money was from the sea and this entailed gruelling hardship and a not i nconsiderab1e amount of danger. First there was the pearl diving. The pearling fleet would set off in mid-June and return in September, and during that period the divers would make about ten dives a day, weighted by a stone and with a clip on their noses something like a clothes-peq h e y would go down anything up to ten fathoms, stuff as many oysters as they could into a bag and come up shivering even when the temperature at the surface was insufferably hot. They could eat only very little because a full meal induced nausea, and they finished the season utterly emaciated. The oysters would be opened on the deck in the evenings and the tawTshes would chuq up in their motor boats to bargain with the captain for the day's hau! By the time the captain had taken his double share, and the financier who had backed the enterprise his much larger share, the diver seldom arrived home with enough cash to last him through to the next diving season. He then had to borrow from the captain of his pear 1ing-bo at or the financier to survive, with the result that the divers were perennially in debt and their debts were inherited by their sons. To call it a hard’life would be a gross under-statement . However there was the^occasional qood-luck story which made it all worth-while. Hilal Almutairi was a penniless bedawi youth110 legend in his own charities in Bombay anrYedd'a C and ma bec ame^a Wa$ ab ' e t0 f ° Und life-time. Much like Premium Bonds really!

He had been elected Shaikh some his uncle Shaikh Salim, who had elected in succession to He had succeeded their within the ye a r The story this way. 0f «i M , Ubar , ak ' S accessi ° n should be told. It happened All and sundry were dissatisfied with the rule of111 &amp; Shaikh Mohammed, and most of all his half-brother Mubarak who decided to do something about it. He did it in the middle of the nigh . In the early morning when the leading people of the community assembled in the Shaikh's majlis accordinq to custom. there was Mubarak sitting where Sh a-TTcTr-ffuh ammad normally sat! Although they must have been surprised none of them were so boorish or brash (or should I say rash?) as to ask questions, (a poker face was an essential of survival in those days). Shaikh ohammad and his half brother Jarrah were never seen again and Mubarak was tacitly accepted as ruler. The only people to raise an eyebrow were the then Political Agent and the Government of India. They felt, I am sure, that it 'wasn't cricket'. In spite of this unorthodox start, his rule had turned out to be highly successful. He had kept Kuwait out of the clutches of the Turks who ruled in Basra to the North and Hasa to the South- he had given shelter to the young 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn S'aud and ’his father Abdur Rahman when they were refugees from Nejd, and had managed to ride out the attacks of the lawless Ikhwan in the As a young man feeling his way Shaikh Ahmad had been much influenced by the then Political Agent - one Colonel Moore. From him he had learnt that 'Punctuality is the politeness of princes' and would keep any appointment to the second. Coming to dine (he liked European style dinners with no other Arabs present) he would stop his car at the Agency gates and not tell his chauffeur to drive on until there were precisely thirty seconds to qo to the appointed time. He had also learnt that 'Gentlemen chanqe for dinner' and always used to wear a black alpaca jacket instead of the traditional Arab cloak over his dishdasha.* He affected to despise the Shaikhs of Bahrain for not doing likewise. 'You know,' he said to me, 'they don't change!' Even worse, he told me, the Shaikh of Bahrain on an official visit had made use of the receptacle which he found under his bed to store some of the oranges and bananas with which he had been presented on arrival by his expatriate subjects. Another precept, ascribed to Colonel Moore and oft repeated by Shaikh Ahmad, was that the P.A. should know and have dealings with nobody in Kuwait except the Ruler, and he never tired of telling me not to visit with the merchants and the people not to mention other members of the Sabah family. This was quite impractical when the agency had to administer controls on trade and issue permits for the import of goods from abroad; and the implication that the P.A. should know nothing about Kuwait except what the Shaikh chose to tell him was utterly unacceptable. Nevertheless, in spite of these quirks. Shaikh Ahmad was an intelligent and hard-working Ruler who achieved a great deal for Kuwait during his long reiqn. * the nightshirt - like garment known as 'gelabiya' 'Gundora' in Oman, and 'thob' in Nejd. in Egypt,113 fh^nnh/’ ddy i, th ! neXt year ’ the Shaikh asked whether I thought it would be a good time to invite offers from Oil Companies for the right to explore his share of the Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. I told him I would refer the question to H.M G. and let him know the result. He replied 'No don t do that I want your personal opinion'. After pointing out my laclc o f q u a l i f i c a 1 1 on to give an opinion on such an important matter, I told him that I could see no reason why ‘ ahead, and was glad to hear afterwards that the very favourable from Kuwait's point of view. he shouldn't go time was indeed A disappointment was the Shaikh's stud of Arab horses At one time it had been famous as one of the best in Arabia, and I wasted no time in asking his permission to go out into the desert and inspect them. He replied that they weren't worth looking at being miserably thin and undersized. Next year, when I renewed my request, he said they had all died of starvation as the bedu had eaten the barley he had sent out for the horses! I very HHIFh doubt if he had ever sent any barley as he was extremely reluctant to spend money if it could possibly be avoided. Jtwas sad that this nucleus of genuine desert-bred Arab horses and their blood-lines should have been lost, but I couldn't make the Kuwaitis see this. Almost all of the area of Kuwait State being level, gravelly, semi-desert could motor-cars, and 'if you can do that' a horse?' they be driven point ed out , over in 'why ride Hawking was also a disappointment. One would drive out in a car to a luxury encampment in the desert (portable generators to provide electric light in the tents!), and next morning take to open cars with the bedu^ handlers sitting in the back with hawks ^ r, 1St K S -. ^ arriva1 in a 1 i ke 1 y area, the cars would stop and the bedu would let out a yell and unhood the hawks lh!s would make any bustard there might be put up their heads. e hawks would see this small movement from an incredible distance and take off. The cars would follow he1ter-ske1ter to where the hawk would be found sitting on a bush looking puzzled then drive round in ever-decreasing circles until the bustard was spotted cowering under a bush. The bedu would shout 'There! ere! Shoot!' and one was expected to blow up the wretched bird on the ground. I did not feel it was sport. The only spectacle was when a bustard took wing. The saqar talcons generally used were not fast enough to catch a fTyi nq bustard, so a peregrine would be flown. This would overtake the quarry, climb to a height above, and stoop on it, only releasing just before they both hit the ground. The peregrine would start to pluck and eat its prey - hopefully dead by that - until the bedu , running up, covered the bustard with Immediately the bustard was concealed from its sight the would put up its head and allow itself to be caught and This was more exciting, but I never saw any game killed i t then t i me sand, falcon hooded114 except for the McQueen's bustard, (gazelle were very scarcel and I soon gave up hawking expeditions. y Ca Ce and The deep-sea fishing was much more fun, particularly if nn* i ^ and find that, while playing it, the One would then reel in the head large .

This sand-grouse, which normally migrate in staying on until late May. When theI115 0 weather then sprung back to its normal May temperature the grouse came over in large packs, flying very low from weakness (one could almost have knocked them out of the air with a walking stick) and even alighting in the sea to drink. On the shady side of the corrugated-iron fences round the plugged oil-wells in the desert their dead bodies were found heaped several feet deep. The bustard seemed to have had more sense and made their migration in good time. It also rained in August, which was exceptionally early for the wasm rains. Masm means 'branding' and is an important occasion for the bedu who gather the camels born in the spring for branding (incidentally the word 'mousim', hence 'monsoon' comes from the same root). Early autumn rain is most important for the bedu as the grass it brings up is strong enough to withstand the cold of January and February, whereas the grass brought up by later rain is cut down by the cold. It is difficult for a European to realise how vitally important rain is to the Arabs. Meeting a bedraggled Arab on a wet day with his soaking mud-spattered dis hd ash a clinging round his legs, I was about to say 'Filthy wet day!' when he spoke up and exclaimed 'Praise God! Good rain!' I quickly changed my comment to 'Thank God!' The occasions on which one had an opportunity to meet the merchants were limited to their two religious festivals, the 'Eid al Adha and the 'Eid al Fitr, when everybody called on every one else. To avoid people being out when called on, the tradition was that every one living in the eastern half of the town would be 'at home' on the first day of the holiday and everyone else would call on them. On the second day those living in the western half of the town would receive. There was a traditional list of families to be called on by the Political Agent which could never be varied and involved making upwards of a dozen calls on each day and on each visit one had to accept a cup or more of coffee. This was not quite the ordeal it sounds as the cups used were very small and each contained only a miniscule quantity of the bitter, unsweetened - but very refreshing coffee. Quite the most interesting call was on the Mujtahid of the Sh ia community. He was the wittiest and most intelligent man in the town and fully au fait with current affairs. It seemed, however, that his position as a religious leader made it impossible for us to have any other contact than these formal visits. The Political Agent, in his turn, used to 'sit' on New Year's Day and the Queen's Birthday.116 :&gt; i n c e There were occasional irruptions from the outside world there was no hotel in Kuwait suitable for the accommodation of nf fh D r V-i- V1S1 i t0 A rS Wlth n ° 1oCa1 host wou1d normally be guests of the Political Agent, and very welcome they were. Then there were periodic visits from ships of the Royal Navy.

Much formality and firing of salutes, but enlivened on one occasion by a Commodore who was much addicted to a drop of gin. I had oxplaTned to him that the Shaikh was strictly teetotal and that alcohol should not be consumed in his presence. His face fell but he bore it manfully. However, on the night, when the guests were all assembled he announced “We can' t all sit round drinking orange squash! I've told my steward to put a double qin in every drink except one,and if the Shaikh looks like taking the wrong onetodropthetray!' ^ ' One could have heard to the Sh aikh with others. There was an the right glass! a pin drop when the steward offered the tray one glass placed slightly in front of the audible sigh of relief when the Shaikh took My chief Sir Geoffrey Prior, had earlier taken the same Commodore to call on the Governor-General of South Persia in bushire and told me that the conversation had gone as follows : - Commodore : 'So you're the Governor-Genera 1 , what?'

'Vesey' I had met a year or two before on a similar mission to the Trucial Coast, and although no doubt an excellent entomologist he was no diplomat. While they were working in Kuwait I had occasion to visit Basra for a few days on business and, on my return, found that Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak, in charge of Public Security, had stopped all anti-locust work owing to some misunderstanding or imagined slight. I was able to get the work started again after a few words with the Shaikh. i r um an o I a I also had c ommanding Basra.

The Oil Company were bringing in numbers of American 'roughnecks' 'roustabouts,' drillers and tool pushers' to bring their wells on stream, and the Motherwell bridge and Engineering Company were importing Scottish and Irish navvies to build tanks and pipe-lines. It was quite a cu11ure-shock , both for the Kuwaities and for the expatriates as they are now known - and we tried to minimise it by keeoina the two apart as far as possible. J M 9 ^ d u ff ' Cted me b^ause the Shaikh had no jurisdiction over non-Muslims and the inevitable crimes and misdemeanours had to be tried in my court. Fortunately they were few and none of them were serious. Since Kuwait had no gaol to which one could in all conscience have committed a foreigner, the ultimate sanction was instant dismi^a! with or without a fine. I found it much more difficult to try cases without the assistance of lawyers on either side, and indeed changed my opinion of the legal profession which I had previously found an unmitigated nuisance i n I n d i a . The Arabs withstood the culture shock remarkably well, although there were occasional difficulties. For instance much of the local labour enlisted by the Oil Company were ex-pear1-divers who were inevitably in debt to their previous masters. These came to me with the request that the company should be told to deduct their employees’ debts from their wages and pay the money to their creditors. This was, of course, out of the question, and I had to advise them to wait outside the offices on pay-day and collect their debts if they could! Finally it all sorted itself out, as there was enough money being earned to make everybody happy. ^ J The problem which began to exercise the minds of the Shaikh and his advisers as it became clear that undreamt-of sums were qoinq to accrue to the state was how to share it out. It was axiomatic to them that nobody but Kuwaitis should be allowed any part in it But how to define a Kuwaiti? This problem they very neatly solved by going back to the events of 1922. In that year Kuwait J nvaded b .y an arm y - or rather a horde - of fanatical Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia. Had they succeeded in entering the town an orgy of killing, looting, and burning would have ensued, and there was something of a panic. Many of the merchants fled o heir countries of origin - Iraq, Iran, or elsewhere - but those who stayed behind erected a mud-wall round the town, the poorer people doing the manual labour and the richer providinq the food and materials for them. It was decreed that only those who could prove they or their ancestors had been 'on the wall* 1 1 Q120 could qualify as Kuwaitis. It was further decreed that only Kuwaitis could own land, and as the oil-money began to circulate land that had previously been almost valueless rocketed in ?[ 1 C c; ., p '; evl u ousl y anybody wanting a plot of land would apply to the Shaikh, who would send his minions to mark it out. Naturally the Shaikh's servants would expect some small douceur, but that was the extent of the expenditure. Now the value of the same land compares with that prevailing in central London or Honq Kong! ^ As the oil-pressure began to rise it was clear that not only the financial status of Kuwait would change but the political status also. To appreciate what was happening it is necessary to look at the genesis of the Kuwait Oil Company. In the 1930 s, the major American Oil Companies were eager to develop the deposits which everyone was fairly certain were lying, like buried treasure worth untold billions of dollars beneath the sea and sand of the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. Not so the Government of India and BP*. BP had more crude oil flowing from their Persian fields than they could conveniently refine or market. The last thing they wanted were further Arab concessions which would put them under pressure to produce vast quantities of crude in competition with their own Persian production. So they dragged their feet; and, as a result, the Bahrain concession went to a consortium of American majors and proved profitable. BP took a certain amount of stick over this in Parliament and the Press, and when the Kuwait concession became active had to be seen to be in there fighting the British corner. The negotiations were involved and prolonged, and culminated in the concession going to a company 50% BP and 50% Gulf Oil Corporation of the U.S.A., to be known as the Kuwait Oil Company. It was laid down by the Government of India when approving these agreements that the management and staff of the companies in the Shaikhdoms should, as far as possible be British; but this requirement had largely gone by the board. In fact, this oil-field proved a God-send to BP when, a few years later, Persian production was embargoed as a result of Moussadiq's nationalisation of Iranian oil. BP were able to make good the shortage by a rapid expansion of Kuwait production. In early 1947 there was a visitation by members of the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee, and it was obvious that the U.S.A. would soon press for their own representation in Kuwait : it was equally obvious that, if this were granted, it would be impossible to keep the door closed against other countries. Ultimately it had to be opened, and now even the U.S.S.R. has an Embassy in Kuwait. * During these years the Ang1o-Persian Oil Co. changed its name to the Ang 1 o - Iran i an Oil Co. and finally to BP. I have therefore referred to it as BP throughout for simplicity121 I did my best to point out to the Shaikh the dangers of a spending-spree and argued that his oil was, in fact an irreplacable capital resource to be conserved and the proceeds invested against the day when it would be exhausted : strictly only the income should be regarded as spending-money. His answer was 'We don't want to be rich in a hundred years' time. We want ^ be i^ iC A h tomorr ^ - or better still, today!' It was an echo of the old Arab G h a nim a syndrome. Now, however, the Kuwaitis have embraced the idea of investment in a big way - and very good they are at it too, except when they invest in other Arab countries (e.g. Sudan) out of sentiment. At this time all the drinking-water for Kuwait town was brought in sai1ing-boats from the Shatt-a 1 -Arab river in Iraq, and sold around the town in 4-gallon Kerosene tins carried on the backs of donkeys. The water-fleet was a picturesque sight as they hoisted sail in the bay at sunrise, but it was a somewhat precarious water-supply. When the oil started to flow the company began to flare the associated gas. This seemed a shocking waste and I suggested to the Shaikh that he should set up a plant to use this gas for distilling sea-water. This suggestion was most unpopular with the Company, who wanted to be left to concentrate on the production of oil, whether it involved the flaring of gas or not. But finally it proved the salvation of. the State when, in 1961, Abdul Karim Qasim set up an Iraqi J-nvasion of Kuwait Kuwait would have been a sitting duck had it still been dependent on Iraqi drinking-water. Apart from the birth of our daughter Alannah on 25th January, there were two major events which affected us in 1947. The first was the export of oil from Kuwait and the second Independence of India and Pakistan. In August I obtained permission to recess in Teheran where we had friends at the Embassy, but on the day of arrival I received orders to return to Kuwait for the declaration of the independence of India and Pakistan. This I rather resented, as there was no danger of Hindu-Muslim rioting, however I turned’the car round and started back for Kuwait the day after I arrived, leaving Pamela ensconced with our friends in Gulheq, the pleasant summer quarters of the Embassy. An evening reception was held at the Agency for the Shaikh and leading members of the Indian and Pakistan communities, where after a minimum of speeches, the flags of the two new countries were run up. The Shaikh was impressed that the British should find a cause for celebration in the loss of an Empire! Not long afterwards the ceremony marking the first export of oil122 took place. The Shaikh ceremonially opened a valve before a large concourse at the new oil-loading terminal and the oil began to flow ’'to the waiting tanker. There was an Arab repast at sun down at the Company head quarters in Kuwait town, where some 400 guests sat down to a magnificent Quzi which was all finished I record with approval, in some 20 minutes flat! It was followed by a splendid fire-work display, during which the Managing cK r ^^ 0r * said to me ' Its a r egular Brock's Benefit! Tell the Ar^hir t 'h tS t a . f re 9 u,ar Brock's Benefit!' I told the Shaikh in roni »H th n t ^ s P ectacu,ar display. Whereupon the Shaikh replied No, that s not what he said. He said it's a Brock something'. I then had to go into a lengthy explanation of who Brock was and what a 'Benefit' was, at the end of which the Shaikh was very little the wiser. it would be nice if people being translated into a foreign language would use more simple and less idiomatic phraseology!

Of course he did. None of them could have extolled the merits of one company over another, so they told him right out which company had bought them. The Shaikh always referred to the companies to me as 'Abdullah A1 Mulla's Company' or 'Izzat Jaafar's company.' One outfit - an American Independent - was even more brash They arrived in a Grumman flying boat which could lower wheels it could come down on either land or water. Shaikh a flight in it.

They carried war-banners and announced that they were going to invade Kuwait and 'takeout* Mohammad. I personally would have shed no tears had they done so, but an armed invasion of Kuwait from Iraq could not be allowed and the British authorities were becoming concerned. (Kuwait then had no armed forces at all). The Shaikh, however, blandly denied the whole scenario, and, in spite of repeated requests, would give me no information on the matter. This simply was not good enough : and I steeled myself for a showdown with Shaikh Ahmad, reflecting that, as I was on the point of leaving Kuwait, any repercussions could be attributed to a clash of personalities and the rift could be healed by my successor. A stormy interview ensued and hard words - very hard words - were used. We took a boot-faced farewell, and I returned to the Agency feeling that I had sealed my term in Kuwait with a monumental blot. However it did not work out like that at all. Next mornig the Shaikh was on the telephone (a local system had just been installed) asking if he could come round and see me. This was surprising as never before had he called to see the Political Agent : it was always the other way round. He arrived all smiles, and immediately revealed the whole story of the imbroglio with the Muntafiq sparing no details. We decided that he should deal with the matter in his own manner while keeping H.M.G. fully informed. And he did so most ably. Talks dragged on until the Shaikh promised to expel Mohammad from Kuwait, and the miscreant, his wives, children, retainers and slaves ostentatiously piled into a fleet of cars, and a cloud of dust progressed southwards in the direction of the S'audi province of A1 Hasa. The Shaikh knew well that the time had come for the Muntafiq to harvest their crops, and the banishment of Mohammad gave’ them the excuse to return to Iraq and do so without losing face. When the move had taken place the cloud of dust reversed itself and came unobtrusively northwards again; but Mohammad was not allowed back into the area of desert bordering Iraq. By the end of the summer blood had cooled and the incident was forgotten . A few days later I handed over to a young man from The Foreign Office who had no Arabic, and felt that an era had come to an end. I can't help thinking that Shaikh Ahmad felt the same for, when I called to say good-bye to him, he was in tears. Driving straight to the stretch of desert where aircraft landed - marked only by a ragged tent and a wind-sock - I found Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak representing the Ruler, with a line of four or so men inA» 125 make-shift uniforms, the nucleus of the Kuwait army,and a sand-storm. The wind was blowing the gravel horizontally so hard that it was difficult to breathe or open one's eyes, and it was almost dark. 50 feet or so up we suddenly emerged into bright, clear sunlight and faced North-west towards a new and entirely different life.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000880.0x0002ed_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F226/28</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000880.0x0002ed</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F226/28</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'THIM DAYS IS GONE'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1975/1985</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-06-16T22:03:22</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (124 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 124; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
