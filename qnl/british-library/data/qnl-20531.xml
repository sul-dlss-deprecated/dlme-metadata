Dear Lefroy, Many thanks for your letter of the 15th April about the Qatar oil situation. The Resident, as I explained to you, has toeen authorised to make our view in regard to the Sdeikh's desire that foreigners in his state should tie sutjectea to the jurisdiction of the shara Courts clear to His Excellency. 2. As regards the supply of arms, we have suggested to the Resident that he should talk the matter over with Mylies, to whom we understand that the Company have made their attitude on the subject clear. We have also authorised him if necessary to remind the Sheikh of the terms of Article 3 of his Treaty. Yours sincerely, J.G. laithwaite. L. Lefroy, Esq., Anglo-Persian Oil Co.Ltd., Britannic House, Pinsdury Circus,(S P.Z. 2722/35. BRITANNIC HOUSE, PINSBISY GIHGUSs LONDON, E.G. 2. 15tti April 1935. J.G. Laithwaite, E sq ., C 4 I,S., India Office, S»W. 1• Dear Laitlawaite, Mylles telegraphs from qatr that, as a result of an informal meeting, the shaikh is still insisting upon a specific provision for payment for arms, and if the provision for jurisdiction of the shara Courts,over foreigners is removed from the concession he will refuse to sign until Government ogree to his demands. Mylles states that the shaikh regards these two points as vital to his independence as a ruler. We understand from My lies that the political HesMoctt is due to-morrow at Dohah, ana that Mylles has also informed the political Agent at Bahrein that the time appears ripe for a declaration hy H.M.G.of their policy to the Shaikh. If in that declaration H.M.G. could definitely inform the shaikh that they would not approve of a concession to any party proviaing specifically for the purchase of arms for the shaikh, and for the jurisdiction of the shara courts over foreigners, we feel that the position should tie materially assisted. In that event we would tell Wylles to go ahead and endeavour to clear up tne financial position, since in the absence of any reference to this it would look as if Iviylles had not yet got to a aiscussion of casn. He is however to have a fornal meeting with tne shaikh to-day if the Shaikh's health permits, and it is likely that the first question discussed was 'Have you brought hack an acceptance of all my requirements?'. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) L. LEPHOY. P.3. Following my conversation with you this afternoon we nave instructed Riylles to represent to the political Resident on arrival our objections to specific provisions for the purchase of arms, ana to obtain the Resident's support on this point. Mylles has further been reminded that he can count on the Resident's support on the jurisdiction question. L.P.CONFIDENTIAL. i i/ &gt;7 No. C/2 70-10/3.

Letter dated the 13-4-1935 froir Mr. C.C.Fylles at DohahCopy of a letter dated the 13th April 1935 from Mr, C.C.J-lylles of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited at Dohah (Qatar) to Captain G.A.Cole, Political Agent, Bahrain. I have had two informal discussions with the Shaikh who is far from well and we are due £ formal meeting on Monday 15th. The following eppenrs to be the position of the outstanding points: ARTICLE 1 1. The Shaikh is still determined to get the cost of arms out of us somehe * but assures me that we can come to terms on the point; I don't luite see how this can be done however. AR TICLE 18 . The Shaikh is inclined to agree to take out of the concession the provision for the trial of foreigners but if he does so he states he will withhold hib signature until he has agreed vith H.M.G that the trial of foreigners in Qatar shall take place in his and the Shara* Courts and failing such an agreement, he further states 1 that he - ill not sign any concessio; It appears to me that the time is not far distant -hen. H.M.G should make clear to the Shaikh thpir policy in both matters viz: the provision of arms and the jurisdiction over foreigners. I will write you - gc _n after the meeting on '!onc'* j, but in the meantime I will be obliged if you will kindly telegraph Colonel Fowle the sense of this- letter. Colonel Fowle will be in Dohah today to do exactly what Mr. M^lles wants and so no further action is necessary until he retiirns. Put up with file.

You may also if course of discussion shows this is essential recognise Hamad as heir apparent (subject to his acceptance of 1916 obligations on his succession). Meaning of such recognition however should be clearly understood by Shaikh. It means that we should be prepared to accept Hamad f s succession when the time comes and implies our moral support but not necessarily that we should intervene in internal affairs ofQatar by giving him active • / support Jn the event of his succession being violently disputed. You may also if this is necessary grant request regarding British protected persons who are subjects cf Kuwait, Bahrain Trucial States but not of course other British protected persons:(it is desirable incidentally to use phrase protected persons /-2- persons not protected subjects).

I enclose copy of a latter from pirie, giving the views of the Air Ministry on the draft prepared here, which will issue (subject to an amendment in its second paragraph to meet the point taken in paragraph 2 of Pirie 1 s letter) substantially as drafted. The Air Ministry attach much Importance to the question of air facilities referred to in the last paragraph of pirie's letter and in particular to being free to pay occasional- visits by aircraft without previous warning, so as to ensure that air facilities are being properly maintained and to enable the pilots to become familiar with the country, especially in the vicinity of the frontier.

Ihe question of what are the best tactics to employ in pressing it on the sheikh is, of course, a Eiatter on which, as we all agree, you are alone in a position to judge.

We know, of course, that in point of fact this is far from heing so and that Powle fully understands the position in this respect and is acting f'S a*2.7 in accordance with your telegrauM^583 and 585 of the 2nd March 1934, to him. since when he has also seen the Air Council latter 3*32797 of the 19th March 1934? so we feel confident that he himself is fully in the picture. Nevertheless we would 'be grateful if in your reply to him, you qualified paragraph 2 by adding words to the effect that you presume he has impressed on the Sheikh that the limited guarantee of protection which are offering would not absolve him from taking all possible measures to provide from his own resources for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own boundaries. As I mentioned to you on the telephone, we feel there might be a real risk of the sheikh tacitly assuming that he need no longer bother about defence&gt; and 'Gr« Laithwaite, Esq.* India Office, Whitehall, 3.W. 1. .of relying entirely on H.M.G. for protact Ion.

Follov^ing are views of His Majesty's Government in the light of discussions betwee^i Departments concerned: (a) As regards rifles Shaikh may be informed that His Majesty's Government in case of emergency will deal sympathetically with any request from Shaikh and will not tie him to his quota of 600. (b) They are opposed to granting Shaikh request in regard to machine guns and armoured cars both because of unfailing provocative effect on Ibn Saud and because of uncertainty as to capacity of Shaikhdqm to produce people competent to use them or even prevent their falling into enemy hands. In principle too they are averse from allowing machine guns and even armed cars to pass into hands of Arab Rubers unless this is quite essential and could not agree to provision of tanks or of 'armoured cars' strictly so-called. You should in these circumstances reply on this point that Hi^ffiajesty 1 s Government have no reason to anticipate a situation in v/hich possession of either machine guns or armoured cars would be necessary to enable Shaikh to secure his interests and that they are unable to give him any undertaking of the nature he describes.

' K - P. .. Letter dated the 11th May 1936 from the Shaikh of Qatar. i. Letter dated the 11 th May 1936 from Mr. C.^jflles, Anglo-Persian Oil Company. noted in the margin. 2. Letter No.l makes clear to the Shaikh that the protection given by His Majesty^ Government is on condition that the Oil Concession is given to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, (paragraph 2 (^), and that the protection is external against serious and unprovoked attacks and refers to / (Signature) l. {Designation) -825S&amp;P—(M-i070)—14-9.34—10,000.-2- 6. / to serious incursions and not to small raids. That His Majesty's Government expect the Shaikh to take all reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own frontieri (paragraph 2 (b)). The letter goes on to . explain (paragraph 2 (c)) that His Majesty's Government propose to assist the Shaikh through the Royal Air Force, while para graph 2 (d) covers the air facilities which His Majesty's Government expect should be put at their disposal. It was stated in India Office telegram No.585 of the 2nd March 1934 T-'l that two landing grounds would be required. In my letter the number is not specified} so if more are necessary they can be used. The last part of paragraph 2 (d) covers the visits of aircraft and Officers to Qatar whenever the Air Officer Commanding considers necessary) while the last sentence of this paragraph covers Intelligence activities on the part of the Royal Air Force. 3. Letter No.2 recapitulates all the points in connection with jurisdiction. Paragraph 6 limits His Majesty's Govern ment's support in internal affairs to difficulties arising from the presence of the Oil Company• The last sentence of this paragraph was inserted at the Shaikh's request and is innocuous. Paragraph 7 mentions what is of course obvious that the arrangements entered into are subject to the Oil Concession being given to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 4. Letter No.3 is from Hamad promising to accept on his accession the Treaty of 1916. 5. Letter No.4 is to the Shaikh suggesting that the Treaty of 1916 should be converted into an heirs and successors one, I • 1 and in letter No.5 the Shaikh agrees•- - 9./ i-o @ i ' -3- 6. Letter No.6 is from Mr. Mylles . Mr. liylles informed me that the Shaikh insisted on this alteration at the last moment, and lias doubtless reported fully to his Company. The effect of this alteration may be to exclude interests other fh a-n the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, e.g. the Iraq etroleum Company. However that is a natter for the Company to settle« 7. The delay of 2 or 3 days in signing the Commercial Agreement, referred to in paragraph 3 of my telegram quoted above, was due to the following attitude taken by the Shaikh, which illustrates the almost childish suspicious nature of himself and his son Hamad. At my final interview with him,, when I settled our political points | I suggested that the Commercial Agreement should now be signed with Mr. Mylles. The Shaikh said: •Ho. He wanted his payment -on -signature before he actually signed'. I suggested that Mr.Mylles could telegraph to the bank in Bahrain, and the latter could then wire the Shaikh that the money had been put to his credit. The Shaikh replied 'that this would never do. How could he know if the telegram from Bahrain really came from the bank ? The Company might send the telegram themselves in the name of the bank and not deposit the money at all V He - the Shaikh - would have to send a man of his own to ascertain that the money was really in the bank'. finally it was agreed that Mr. fiylles would telegraph to the bank and the Shaikh's man would be sent to Bahrain to bring back the credit note and show it to the Shaikh. 8. Some of Kr. Mylles'difficulties in dealing with such an individual may be imagined and as I have already said in paragraph 11 of my telegram 110.372 of 22nd April 1935 he/conducted his negotiations with much patience, tact and skill.

Dear Laithwaite, Q,atr« In confirmation of our telephone conversation this afternoon, a telegram came in last night from Mylles stating that agreement had been reached within the limits of his financial discretions, 'but that the Shaikh of Qatr wished to de3i3y signature until agreement had 'been reached between himself and His Majesty's Qovernment, For the present the Shaikh was not fit for further discussion, 'but a doctor was expected today» In addition to the straightforward financial provisions we have accepted a liability to bear the expenses of two representatives of the Shaikh in Qatr if necessary, with salaries which are to be reasonable and suitable to their position and duties. vie have furthermore sanctioned grants of considerable quantities of free petrol and kerosene to the Shaikh during the currency of the Agreement. ¥e telegraphed today to Mylles reminding him of the arrangements made with you, under which when he signs it must be subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. Furthermore, after signature copies of the Concession and letter of reservation are to be sent to the Resident. Mylles has informed us of the salutary effects of the Resident's recent visit to Qatr, but did not mention the Government/r? 2 - Government/Company Agreement, so I expect that the Resident thought that with jurisdiction and other difficult questions there was enough dehatahle matter for the moment with the Shaikh, and as we originally arranged will show the Shaikh the Government/Company Agreement after some concession has been signed.

Fowle is nowvproceeding to Qatar with a view to clinching matters with t^fe Sheikh, who has, we understand from Lefroy 1 s letter of ^rd May of which a copy is enclosed, given the Company a vaguely-worded letter of acceptance of their proposals, coupled with intimation that his acceptance is subject to acceptance by Eis Majesty's Government of his requirements of them and that he requires a decision within 10 days from apparently 3rd May. 2. ?fe need not perhaps attach too much importance to the Sheikh's time limit, but it will be desirable to arrange in the immediate future for the signature of the Qatar Grovernment Agreement, which was for practical purposes agreed early last year as a result of discussions between the interested Departments and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and I enclose a copy of it in its latest form with a few minor amendments, which has now been sent to Lefroy under my letter of to-day of which a copy is also enclosed. Sterndale Bennett, Esq., C.M.G., M.C., Foreign Office.Hay we a^-suine that che PorGi^n Officfe haYe no further observations to offer on it and that they will see no objection to signature if circum stances justify this by a member of this Office, on behalf of His Majesty^s Government, under the same procedure as was adopted in the case of the Koweit Government Agreement? Atvl 3. //I ought to add that in agreement with the company it Was decided last year (compare Lefroy's letter to me of roth October last and my reply of 18t&gt;h October, copies ^ sent to Foreign Office, Admiralty and under our printed letter P.

From papers available here it seems last consign ment imported by Shaikh was in 1927 and it is understood that before that date Shaikh was suspected of selling of rifles supplied to him in interior. If then Shaikh were alloweu to import as suggested in clause (a) of your telegram he could apparently bring in a consignment of some 4000 weapons. This would enable him to run flourishing arms trade in interior and possibly in Persia. We reilise that under article 3 of ^atar Treaty he is allowed an annual import of 500 weapons but strength of his fighting men could hardly justify recurring import even on this scale. 3* We would suggest that it is desirable to proceed with caution. - SECBETARI OF STATE FOR INDIA - Copy given to Political Agent, Bahrain./ 82/27 |jV Telegram xx From Political Resident at Bagdad.

Name to be inserted in blank space at the end as Government signatory is LEONARD DAY WAKELY C.B. -^Secretary of State for India.' ^ New Points affecting the Shaikh raised by Government ''Agreement and by covering letter to Shaikh ♦ s L 7* ARTICLE 1 » Article XII of the Commercial Agreement comprises two parts (a) Company has the right to transfer the Agreement to any other Commercial Coy&gt; (b) Has the right to form a Company which must be identical with the A^P.O.C. Re: (a). Article 1 of Govt .Agreement restricts right of transfer of Company only after consent of H.M.G. and the transferee shall be British» Re: (b)• This point is not affected, AR TICLE 11 &gt; The Shaikh has agreed to a subsidiary Coy. which should be identical with tjie A.F.O.C^'-' The present Article5 which merely insists on the subsidiary Coy. being British, does not affect the Shaikh's demand. ARTICLE 111 * See Article XVII of Commercial Agreement. Latter enly ensures that labourers shall be Qataris. Present Clause lays down that employees5 which would include clerks or or foremen, shall be Qataris(subject to the other provisions of this Clause). Some Oa. these higher employees might perhaps come from the Shaikh's own family. This is to the advantage of the Shaikh and it could be point ed out to him that the Coy. might be willing to train suitable members of the Shaikh's subjects in technical matters. With regard to the second paragraph of this Clause 'foreign native labour'. This can /can be pointed out to the Shaikh that the P .R. will assist him - the Shaikh - in preventing the Company from importing foreign labour► ARTICIiil IV C .L .R. This can be pointed out to the Shaikh as a measure of convenience, an advantage in that it gives the Shaikh only one responsible head to deal with. ARTICLE V * Distinctly advantageous to the Shaikh since Coy. have got to pay due deference to his wishes. -arttmvt » This does not bind the Shaikh as he has so far made no regulations, but on the other hand it binds the Coy» to accept his regulations if and when he does make any. ARTICT .'h 1 . vil . In brief thas means that any sites (e.g. aerodromes, harbours) or means of communication (e.g. wireless) which in the opinion of His Majesty 1 s Govt, are necess ary for the defence of the Shaikh shall i not come under the control of the Coy. With regard to the second part of this Clause i»e. 'harbours under exclusive control of the Coy.' . This goes no x further than Clause VI of the Commercial Agreement 1 and it will be to the interest of the Coy* to inprove the harbour for instance perhaps be able to find a deep water channel in, which will be to the advantage of the Shaikh. Sec. 6 of C.A- gives Coy. the right to construct / Article VTIIARTICLE IX. Article x . / 1. JUO ARTICLE XI . y ?i irr -3- construct W/T etc* etc. which present Clause binds the Coy» not to operate this W/T etc. etc. in such a wqy as to inter fere with any W/T etc. constructed by the Shaikh or by H.M.G. for his defence. Refinery when constructed will be to the advantage of the Shaikh. Pre-emption. National emergency or war means one in which H.M-G. are the sole judge. This makes no Difference to the Shaikh as by pre-emption is meant that the Govt, shall have the right of buying the Oil from the Coy., who will of course continue to pay to the Shaikh what they are due to pay him. In Article 14 (b) of Commercial Agreement the Shaikh has the right to cancel the Commercial Agreement for certain breaches of that Agreement after arbitration (vide ^ATt. 16). Present Clause gives Shaikh a similar right for any breach of the Govt. Agreement. yc Draft Letter to Shaikh. 3 (a) It can be pointed out to Shaikh that since the terms of the Political Agreement are either favourable to him, or deal with matters in which he is not concerned, it is obviously to his advantage that the Pol. Agreement should over-ride the Commercial. Further /3 (b) fi Further H.E.G, are not a party to the Commercial Agreement and the only way they \ the Coy.^to ^e that the V have of Vj -- Lj#/ -— ' u ' 1 '' Pol. Agreement should override the Commer cial Agreement# Should the Shaikh ask for examples of overriding we could take the cases of (a) transfer of Concession vide Art- &gt;&lt; XII of C.A# and Article 11 of Govt»Agreement (b) Employment of Qataris vide C.A. Art•XVXI and G.A.Art. III. Briefly this means that if the Shaikh terminates the Concession owing to a breach by the Coy» of the Govt .Agreement (vide para XI of Govt .Agreement above) he gets the same rights in regard to return of land etc. as if he had terminated it under the Commercial Agreement. 'Under Article VII of C.A. they can take any land, but under Article VIII of Govt. Agreement they cannot take ground required for aerodromes for Shaikh's defence.

I should like to take this opportunity of saying how much in my opinion, (which I have already expressed to His Majesty's Government), this satisfactory result has been due to the tact, patience and skill with which you conducted your side of the negotiations made all the more difficult by the mentality of Shaikh Abdullah and his relations • My experience of Shaikhs has been fairly extensive, out X have never met one so difficult to deal with as our j.riend of Qatar* C.

Mylles has given us an account of the dramatic scenes hysterics and tears of the penultimate stage, so that I hope you found a little entertainment in that unattractive land and not difficulties alone.
