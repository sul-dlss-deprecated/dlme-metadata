Hiey are both now in charge of the Customs, and are negligable items. Persia moreover has no Ministry of Marine. To report their movements even by letter seems to be a pure waste of time.

The following instruc- lions' were._issued to the Political Agent, Muscat, in 1 9 ^ 0 . Begins:- There is no obligation for a British Consular Officer to call on a foreign man of war unless he desires to do so. French consuls in the Gulf rarel^r if ever pay official calls _ on British ships of war,. Should you wish to pay official visit you-should be guided by Article 3 of Chapter XVIII of ’’Consular Instructions”; that is to say you should not pay the first can unless the officer commanding be of a rank corresponding to a captain of the Roj^al Navy of more than three years service. Of course you could make an unofficial visit when and how you liked. Ends. Your position is ^lightly different as you are not actually a consul, but you take precedence as one, and the commander would probably consider you one, as in the case of ”La Surprise” As regards the second paragraph of your telegram, you have not been included amongst reporting officers in the latest instructions and you need only report arrival and departure of foreign men of war to this office.
