The following Notes on the Tribes of the Aden Protectorate were originally compiled by Captains F. M. Hunter and C. W. H. Sealy, I. A., in 1886, and have been corrected and added to from time to time by various officers of the Aden Residency. They are now re-published as finally revised and brought up to the end of September 1907 by Captain A. H. E. Mosse, Assistant Political Resident. 18th June 1908. J. W. B. MEREWETHER, Major, First Assistant Resident, Aden.GENERAL REMARKS. INDIA OWOE. The zone within which British influence is more im mediately felt in the neighbourhood of Aden may be said to be comprised by a semi-circle having a radius of eighty miles, with the peninsula of Aden for its centre. To the eastward beyond that distance, and especially on the sea-coast, Great Britain is looked on as a kind of paramount power, which, while recognising independence in regard to internal government, yet is ready to prevent alienation of territory to foreign nations, or inter-tribal disputes which are carried on to the detriment of the public peace or the interests of commerce. 2. Some 60 miles westward of Aden the maritime moun tain chain recedes from the sea, leaving a considerable plain, which is again narrowed down to the coast by the hills in the Haushabf and Fadthli districts. Our topographical knowledge of the country was considerably increased by the Surveys made in connection with the Anglo-Turkish Boundary Commission in 1902-0^, and a map since compiled is appended. 3 4 * * 3. The low-lying sandy plains are here and there intersec ted by the beds of mountain torrents, which do not always debouch on to the sea, and are the only sites of cultivation. In the neighbourhood of A 1 Hauta in the ’Abdalf territory the bifurcation of the Wadi Tiban has produced an oasis, but even in this district the effect of the neighbouring torrent beds is lost ere ten miles are traversed from the spot where the so-called river divides itself. It may here be noted that while the stream runs ordinarily it is termed “ A 1 Ghail ”, whilst floods designated “ Dafar” occur about four times a year. 4. The general features of each district, as well as the climate, people, supplies, commerce and administration, will be specially alluded to in the descriptions of the territories occupied by the several tribes.11 GENERAL REMARKS. 5. Since Aden first passed under the sway of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, various engagements have been entered into with the tribes in the neighbourhood. At first a multitude of claimants to the consideration of the British Government pre sented themselves,—witness the numerous treaties to be found in Volume VII of Sir Charles Aitchison’s compilation—but by 1880 the tribes regarded as under British protection had narrowed down to nine. Since then, however, it has been found advisable to extend our intercourse with the tribes in certain directions. The number of tribes now in direct treaty relations with the British Governmenti is fifteen. 6. The tour of the Boundary Commission and the British occupation of Dthala inevitably brought about an increase of our influence in the Hinterland and a corresponding set-back to that of the Turks. On the other hand our recent withdrawal from Dthala (for no apparent reason from the Arab point of view) has as inevitably resulted in a certain loss of British prestige. 7 7. Appendix A gives a detailed statement of all the tribes with whom the Aden Residency ordinarily has relations.b 744—1 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The Abdali'. The district inhabited by the ’Abdalf tribe, and which has been known from very early times as ‘ Lahej is bounded on the west by a line which, starting from a boundary pillar situated about a mile from the sea near the Hiswa, on the northern shore of the Aden harbour, and passing about three miles to the east of Bfr Ahmed and west of Darb through an uncultivated space, extends in a north-easterly direction to A 1 ’Anad, a small stone fort about 35 miles from the Barrier Gate. The north-eastern boundary runs from A 1 ’Anad across the sand-drifts and desert to near Bfr ’Uwaidain ; thence it turns westerly again towards ’Imad, where it meets British territory. A strip of territory on the sea-shore remains Fadthlf property. Until 1881 the ’Abdalf territory completely cut off Aden from the interior, except by passing through the Lahej district; but by a later arrangement the Fadthlf boundary, as above noticed, is conterminous with the British on the east ward, as is that of the ’Akrabf on the westward. Lahej may be generally described as a large sandy plain watered by a torrent, which bifurcates a few miles below Zaida. Of the two branches, the westerly, or Wadf-al-Kabfr, finds its way to the sea at Hiswa, the easterly, or Wadf-al- Saghfr, after passing ’Imad. It is only after floods that the water ever reaches Darb and Fiyush, but it may always be found in the bed of the torrent a few feet below the surface, and large quantities from the Hiswa (a word signifying an - underground channel) used to be brought daily into Aden for sale. The stream is perennial and rises beyond the Haushabf territory in the neighbourhood of Ta’izz. In many parts of the district the surface soil consists of a silty alluvium which has been brought down from the hills by the streams in the ordinary manner of delta formation, and in2 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. these oases there is rich cultivation, the soil, with a trifling amount of labour, yielding large quantities of red and white jowari, sesame, vegetables, grass and a little cotton. In the neighbourhood of A 1 Hauta there are several groves of date palms and badam or wild almond trees. Between the culti vated lands there are large patches of blown sand which has been carried along by the south-west monsoon, and overlies, in the opinion of Mr. Mallet, the alluvium which is probably continuous, though covered over and concealed.* Beneath it, sand is found again passing down into gravel, and in some parts an earthy lignite has been met with, which on analysis has been ascertained to be quite unfit for purposes of fuel. The total population of this district is estimated at 15,000, and the area is approximately 180 square miles. The climate does not differ much from that of Aden. * Mr. Mallet’s Report on the Geology of Aden. The principal and, in fact, the only place deserving the name of a town in this district is A 1 Hauta. It is situated at a distance of 21 miles from the Barrier Gate, and is the residence of the Sultan and his family. Its houses are mainly built of sun-dried bricks and plastered with mud. There are also huts constructed of merely branches of trees and grass. There is a somewhat elegant mosque. The buildings occupied by the Sultan’s family are lofty, and externally present an imposing appearance, but the interiors are ill-designed according to European ideas. The number of inhabitants is estimated at 9,000. Particulars regarding the other villages in the Lahej territory will be found in Appendix C. No regular census of the inhabitants of Lahej territory The people. ^ as ever ^ een ma de, and it is, there fore, impossible to give reliable statistics. The population consists of ’Abdalf and other cognate Arab tribes, Muwallads and outcasts, besides a sprinkling of Somalis. A list of the principal Shaikhs now living and the approximate number of their followers is given in one of the annexed statements. The^e persons are generally owners of land, or hold office under the Sultan. They never demean themselves by labour of any kind, but they are liable to be called on for military service. I he status of slavery exists in Lahej as in other Maho- medan countries; but few, except the Sultan and some of the principal Shaikhs, are able to take advantage of; it. TheTHE ’ABDALI'. 3 former possesses several Sawahilf, who form his body-guard, and are said to be very faithful. Since the occupation of Aden by the British the importation of slaves has ceased. Besides the true Arabs there are tribes known as Khadim, Hajirf and Muwallad. The first-named are doubtless descended from Negroes ; they are few in number, those in the Lahej district probably not exceeding 50. They employ themselves in sweeping and removing carcases, and their position is analogous to that of the Indian mehta. Hajirfs are said to be so called after a village in Hadthramut where the fore fathers of the tribe, now found in this neighbourhood, originally resided. They are likewise supposed to be of African origin, and are sub-divided into numerous families, such as Ba- Hasan, Ba-Haid, Ba-’Ujair, etc. The number of Hajirfs in the ’Abdalf district is estimated at 150. They, as well as the Khadims, are migratory, and visit the various villages of the maritime plain during harvest time. Arabs never intermarry with either the Hajirfs or Khadims. Muwallads hardly require notice, as they are found all over Arabia, being descended from unions between Arabs and Africans. Their social status is but one degree below that of the pure Arab, and they frequently become the founders of families through intermarriage with Arab women of undoubted descent. About 400 Muwallads are found in the Lahej territory. The ’Abdalf are the most civilised, but the least warlike, of all the tribes in South-Western Arabia. Since the beginning of the last century, when the declining power of the ’Imams 01 San’a enabled the ’Abdalf chief in concert with his neighbour, the Yafaf Sultan, to seize the stronghold of Aden and to proclaim his own independence, we do not read of a single attempt on the part of the tribe to increase the extent of their territories, or to put in execution the schemes of aggression which they doubtless secretly nourished. On the other hand, their capital, A 1 Hauta, has several times suffered from the predatory attacks of their more warlike neighbours the Fadthlf and the ’Aulakf, and has on each occasion only escaped entire destruction by the payment of a heavy ransom. About a hundred years since, the principal sub-tribe, the ’Akrabf, threw off its allegiance and wrested the fort of Bfr Ahmed from the hands of the Sultan of Lahej, who had but a short time previously erected it, whilst the powerful clan of the ’Uzaibf has several times, since the capture of Aden by the British, set the authority of the Sultan at defiance,4 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. and, by allying itself to hostile tribes, has acted in complete opposition to his interests and wishes. The revenues of the Lahej State are derived from several n sources : from a land tax, from transit dues, river tax, and from a large num ber of monopolies, besides a stipend from the British Govern ment. With regard to the first, all land in the possession of private cultivators is held under a permanent settlement, which dates back as far, in many instances, as the establish ment of the independence of the ’Abdalf tribe. The assess ments are recorded in certain documents called “ dafras,” which form not only the territorial but the historical archives of the Arab States. The history of the ’Abdalf tribe, for instance, compiled by Captain Haines, and embodied by Captain Play fair in his “ History of Yemen/’ was founded on the materials contained in the “ dafras ” of Lahej. In assessing the land revenue the superficial unit is the “ dthimd/’ which literally signifies the area which can be ploughed by a yoke of oxen between sunrise and sunset, but which now possesses merely a conventional meaning, and is equivalent to about 1,700 or 1,800 square yards, or about one acre. There are two agricultural seasons in the year—the “saif,” or summer, and the “ bukur,” or winter. Jowari is the cereal which is principally cultivated: of this, the white species is sown in the “ saif ” and the red in the “ bukur,” and it is usual to have two harvests of each, and occasionally three.* But, however the season may be, a land tax of 1J dollars per annum is exacted per “ dthimd,” collected in four instalments, and, in addition to this, tithes are levied on produce under the name of “ firka.” The actual area under cultivation cannot exceed more than two-fifths of the whole territory, although there is no doubt that, were irrigational works carried out, this proportion might be greatly increased. The revenue derivable from land may be estimated at about 1,500 dollars per annum, which is spent by the Sultdn on himself, his relations, and his soldiers and favorites (Ashab-ad-Daula). It is difficult to correctly estimate the revenue annually realised by the Sultan from the levy of transit dues, but it was estimated in 1885 that he derived a yearly average of * The first crop, which is called “ ab ” (a contraction of finest; the second is called “ akb ” ; and the third “ akb-al-akb ', the “ saif ” is frequently seen growing alongside of the “ ab ” of the “ bab-adoor ”), is the The “ akb-al-akb ” of “ bukur ”.THE ’ABDALI'. 30,000 dollars on goods passing through his territory in and out of this Settlement. From the river water 3,000 dollars annually were obtained ; monopolies fetched 8,000 dollars; his own landed property yielded 10,000 dollars ; and the stipend from Government aggregated nearly 20,000, making an annual total revenue of nearly 72,000 dollars at that time. It is probably considerably more at the present time. The administration of civil and criminal justice is, of .. . . course, based on the precepts of the Administration. tr , 1 i • • i i i r i Koran, and is in the hands ot the Kadthf of Lahej. The Sultan occasionally adjudicates in serious cases. The ordinary punishment for theft is impri sonment, but the prisoner is sometimes sentenced to suffer amputation of the right hand. There are three kinds of homicide, corresponding with our classification of murder, manslaughter, and death by misadventure. The Arabs look upon these offences as identical in kind, and differing only in degree ; there is, therefore, only one punishment—death at the hands of the nearest relative of the deceased, unless the “ diya ” or blood money is paid. The “ diya ” varies according to the degree of the offence. In the case of wilful murder, the life is estimated at 100 female camels, or 1,000 gold Venetian sequins ; in the case of manslaughter, 700 dollars ; whilst should an instance of death by misadventure occur, although the “ diya is the same, the culprit is not imprisoned, but is allowed to appeal to the pity of the charitable for the means of escaping from a cruel death, whilst he is not un- frequently forgiven by the relatives. Should the nearest of kin be a child, the punishment is postponed until he arrives at the years of manhood. The accompanying genealogical table (Appendix D) gives „ . . f the descent of the reigning family from Reigning family. , . . _ ® their progenitor Fadthl bin Ah bin Fadthl bin Saleh bin Salam. The ’Abdalf tribe is split up into about sixty septs, the principal of which are the ’Azzaiba, the Ahl Sallam, the Am-Shahhaira and Az-zabbaira, the first two of which were always included in the early treaties with the Sultan of Lahej as being almost co-extensive in power with that chief, though nominally under his authority. A list of these septs and their minor sub divisions will be found in an accompanying statement. Sub-tribes and septs.6 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. In 1881 the Subehf were placed under the sovereignty of the Abdali. I his large tribe inhabits the country bordering on tbe sea from Ras ’Imran to Bab-al-Mandeb. This is bounded on the north by the Maktarf, Sharjabf, Athwan and other tribes under Turkish suzerainty. Of all the tribes in the. vicinity of Aden the Subehf approach nearest to the typical Bedawin in character. True “ Children of the Dawn ”, as their name may be held to imply, they by preference select that hour for their attacks on wayfarers. They are divided into a large number of petty clans (z'zflk Appendix A), hew of these devote any attention to agriculture, nor do they er ^S a § e commerce to any extent. Many members of the tribe, however, earn a livelihood by becoming mukadams or leaders of kafilas from other districts which pass through the Subehi country en route to Aden. On account of their frugal diet, which consists of little else than jowan, they are very spaie in frame, but possess great powers of endurance, and have a high reputation for courage, though it is dimmed by their character for treachery. In consequence of their poverty, few of them own camels, none horses, but the camels of the district are considered equal in speed to the latter animal in consequence of the great attention paid to their breeding. Agreements have been made with the Dubenf, Manshrf, Makhdumf and Ruja f sub-divisions of the Subehf wTereby in consideration of a monthly allowance, the traffic passing through their districts is freed from transit dues, and protec tion granted to travellers. The annals of the reigning family of Lahej are given in Historical Resume Playfair’s History of Yemen; but as this work is not accessible to everv one, an amplified recapitulation here seems necessary. ,. ^he Progenitor of the ’Abdalf tribe named FadthI bin ’Ah' bin Fadthlbm Saleh bin Salam being appointed by the ’Imam of San a A 1 Mansfir Husain bin Kasim, to be Governor of Lahej, found the Shaf 1 soldiers at deadly enmity with the Zaidi inhabitants in his district. The newly appointed ruler although himself a Shaff, managed by skilful measures and promises to win over the Zaidi subject population, and with heir assistance expelled the troops of the ’Imam, who was too weak to assert his authority. In this way FadthI bin ’All became independent in ,728 Fearing that the ’Imam might again re-assert his authority,“heTHE ’ABDALl'. 7 allied himself with the Yafaf, Fadthlf, Haushabi and other neighbouring tribes by paying them tribute, and he likewise conciliated the influential Mansabs of Waht. The ’Imam eventually sent troops against the combined forces of the tribes mentioned, but was repulsed. Aden was at that time in the hands of the ’Uzaibf, who were a powerful tribe nearly independent of Fadthl bin ’Ah'. At the instigation of the ’Imam, Fadthl bin ? AH was treacherously murdered by the Yafaf at a wedding feast in 1742, and this tribe then seized and plundered Aden Fadthl ’Alf reigned seven years, and was succeeded by his son ’Abdul Karfm, who subsequently recaptured Aden. He was a wise and benevolent prince, but of indolent character. During his reign the Zaidfs of Hajaria invaded Lahej and, it is said, blockaded Aden. According to one account, these fanatics were bought off; according to another, they were driven back with the assistance of the Haushabf. At all events it was in this reign that the ’Abdalf consented to pay 35 dollars a month as tribute and 100 dollars per annum on account of the water of the Tiban, which is necessary for the irrigation of the Lahej district. In 1753, ’Abdul Karfm died, and was succeeded by his son ’Abdul Hadf. In 1771, the ’Uzaibf, with the assistance of the Fadthlf, attacked Aden, but were expelled after two days’ occupation. ’Abdul Hadf died in 1776 of small-pox, which carried off nearly one-fourth of the inhabitants of Lahej and the surrounding districts, but did not enter Aden. His brother Fadthl occupied the Sultanate until 1792, when Ahmed, another brother, succeeded to the chieftainship. He was attacked in A 1 Hauta, his capital, by the Yafaf, who were only dislodged with the assistance of the Haushabf. It was during this prince’s reign that the visits of Mr. Salt in 1809 and Captain Haines, of the Indian Marine, in 1820 took place. He behaved in the most friendly manner to the British, and afforded an asylum to the troops under Colonel Murray after the evacuation of Perim in 1799, until the change of the monsoon admitted of their proceeding to Bombay. A commercial treaty was made with this Sultan by Sir H. Popham (No. ’XXXIII). When the Joasmi pirate fleet entered Aden, the Sultan de- * The numbers here given to the treaties and engage ments are those allotted in Aitchison’s Treaties, edition of 1892. fended a large Surat vessel against8 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN, the Wahabis, who were compelled to put to sea.

Sultan Ahmed died in 1827 after a reign of nearly 36 years, and was succeeded by his cousin and son-in-law Mohsin bin Fadthl, Shaikh of A 1 Hamra, who was a man of a very different stamp, being inhospitable, deceitful, avaricious and unscru pulous. In 1839 after an 'Abdalf outrage on a British dhow, Aden was captured by the British, After its capture the ’Abdalf Sultan entered into a treaty (No. XXXIV), dated 2nd bebruary 1839, for the protection of the approaches to Aden, and by a bond signed in June of the same year the British Government became responsible for the stipends paid up to that date by the'Abdalf to the Fadthlf, Yafaf, Haushabf and Amiri tribes. At the same time the Sultan’s annual subsidy was fixed at 6,500 dollars, and the alliance was declared offensive and defensive. The limits of British territory were defined, and the jurisdiction of the contracting parties specified (No. XXXV), It was not, however, until February 1844 that the monthly stipend of the Sultan of Lahej was restored to him, he having up to 1841 continued to molest the British. I o guarantee his fidelity, a more stringent agreement than that previously existing was entered into (No. XXXVI), and a further bond was executed on 20th February 1844 (No. XXXVII). Sultiin Mohsin bin Fadthl died on the 30th November ^rid was succeeded by his son Ahmed, who, sensible of the advantages which friendly relations would confer on his tribe, used his utmost endeavours to cultivate the ^ood opinion of the British. He visited Aden in 1848, but unfor tunately died on the 18th January 1849. Ahmed was succeeded by his brother ’AH, who resembled his father in cunning and treachery. He sought, as is usual with Arabs, to make himself out to be the only friend of the British amongst the surrounding tribes. In this for a time he was successful. In October 1849 the commercial treaty (No. XXXVIII), which still regulates our relations with the ’Abdalf, was executed. For a series of years the Fadthlf tribe continued to annoy the British, and, as our ally, the Lahej Sultan suffered from reprisals. In 1857 Sultan ’Alf took umbrage at a friendly/ THE ’ABDAL 1 '. 9 visit paid to the Political Resident by his brother ’Abdalla, and was further offended by the conclusion of an agreement with the Fadthlf, in which his intervention was not sought, whereby the opportunity to intrigue was lost. He commenced to create dissensions among the ’Uzaibf, a sub-tribe of the ’Abdalf, which had been uniform in its fidelity to the British. Then a vexatious impost was introduced on the wells at Shaikh ’Othman on which the town and shipping of Aden were to a great extent dependent for water. Finally, the punishment of Sultan ’AH was determined on, and an adequate force proceeded against Shaikh ’Othman on the 18th March 1858, when the Arabs were completely defeated with a loss of from 30 to 40. Shaikh ’Othman was restored to the ’Abdalf, and no further disturbances were occasioned by Sultan ’AH, who died on the 7th April 1863, and was succeeded by his eldest son Fadthl. Young and inexperienced, he had no sooner taken the reins of power into his own hands than his more ambitious uncles began to intrigue with a view to his displacement. One party was headed by ’Abdalla, the eldest surviving son of the old Sultan Mohsin, who, with his brother’Abdul Karfm, had for some time past been at feud with those members of his family who were the offspring of a different mother. The majority of the tribe, however, were anxious that the Sultanate should be filled by the next eldest brother Fadthl bin Mohsin, who was in the prime of life, and was thought to be of an active and resolute character. An arrangement was, therefore, ultimately made through the mediation of the Resident at Aden, and with the cordial consent of the young Sultan, by which the Government was transferred to this chief. Sultan ’Abdalla ostensibly gave in his adhesion to this arrangement, but took no pains to conceal his dislike to his brothers, or to act in common with them when circumstances rendered it desirable that he should do so. Sultan Fadthl bin Mohsin preserved friendly relations with the British Government. During the expedition against the Fadthlf in 1865-66 the Sultan accompanied the troops through out, and, in'acknowledgment of the assistance rendered by him, he was presented by Government with the sum of 5.000 dollars. In February 1870 he proceeded to Bombay, as a guest of Government, during the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh, and travelled through various districts of the Presi dency.IO ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. Towards the close of 1872 the effects of the advance of the Turkish conquest in Yemen began to be felt in the neigh bourhood of Aden ; and in May of that year the Ottoman troops at the invitation of the Haushabf advanced to the borders of the Lahej district. Representations were made at once by Her Majesty’s Government to the Porte, which gave assurances that the troops should be withdrawn. But this was not done, and the Haushabf began to encroach on Lahej territory. In the meantime ’Abdalla Mohsin, who has been above alluded to, the eldest brother of the ’Abdalf Sultan, together with his son and another brother had intrigued with the Turks, who, at his invitation, occupied his fortified house at A 1 Hauta. Authorised by the Government of India, the Resident (Brigadier-General J. W. Schneider, C.B.) accom panied a force of artillery, cavalry and infantry, and occupied the Lahej territory, but it was not until December that the Turkish troops were eventually withdrawn. ’Abdalla Mohsin, his son and brother surrendered, and the Zaida district was handed over to the Sultan of Lahej. Fadthl bin Mohsin died much regretted, on the 5th July 1874, and was succeeded by his nephew Fadthl bin ’AH, who, it will be recollected, had previously been Sultan for a few months in 1863. Deprived of the fertility of resource and advice of his uncle Mohammed Mohsin, who died in October 1881, Fadthl bin ’AH showed himself to be of an unreliable disposition, constantly quarrelling with his neighbours, or annoy ing them in petty ways. In 1876 an arrangement was effected between the’Akrabf and ’Abdalf, by which they mutually bound themselves not to give shelter to members of one tribe against the wishes of the ruler of the other. After the events of 1873 ’Abdalla Mohsin continued to intrigue, and fomented the disagreement between the ’Abdalf and Haushabf in regard to the Zaida district. In 1877 ’Abdalla Mohsin taking up his abode with the Makhdumf and Mansurf, incited the Sub^hf to plunder on the roads, until in April 1878 an expedition by sea and land was despatched to punish the Buraimf, a sub-tribe of the Subehf. The expedition was successful, and in 1880 ’Abdalla Mohsin died. ’Abdul Karfm Mohsin and Fadthl bin ’Abdalla Mohsin died in 1877, and thus the principal actors in the episode of 1872-73 dis appeared. A truce was arranged between the Haushabf and ’Abdalf, but dissensions continued in regard to certain landst THE ’ABDALI'. II purchased by the ’Abdalf from the Subehf; however all causes of disagreement between the Haushabf and ’Abdali were satisfactorily terminated by the signature on the 14th July 1881 of an agreement (of which a copy is attached in Appendix B) whereby a portion of the Zaida lands was restored to the Haushabf. The Subehf continuing to annoy wayfarers, the subsidies of all but the Dubenf sub-tribe were stopped in 1880, and the Ruja’f chief, a ringleader, was seized and imprisoned by the ’Abdalf. Eventually, the Subehf were placed under the control of the ’Abdalf by an agreement signed on 5th May 1881 (copy of which is annexed in Appendix B), in consideration of their stipends being made over to the ’Abdalf. In September 1882 the ’Abdalf made an expedition against the Subehf which resulted in nearly all the sub-tribes submitting to him, but shortly afterwards he showed a disposition to evade the responsi bilities imposed upon him by the abovementioned agreement. In 1878 negotiations were commenced for the purchase by the British of the territory of Shaikh ’Othman between the Hiswa and ’Imad, the main object of the acquisition being to remove thither part of the civil population in order to relieve the military town and garrison from pressure. On the 7th February 1882 the deed of sale to that effect was signed by the ’Abdalf Sultan (a copy of this deed is attached in Appendix B). By this purchase British territory was increased from an area of 35 to an area of over 70 square miles; the aqueduct between Shaikh ’Othman and Aden and the salt pits at Shaikh ’Othman becoming the property of Government. During 1885 the chronic feud between the ’Akrabf and Ahl-as-Saila assumed an acute stage and 1885 and 1886. j ec | some plundering on the British border. A year’s truce was effected between the hostile parties. At the beginning of 1886 a survey of the territories on the ’Akrabf borders was made but it was not found possible to adjust the conflicting claims of the Subehfs, the ’Abdalf and ’Akrabf, the latter having no effective control over a consider able district to which he lays claim. Between May and July 1886 the ’Abdalf made repeated complaints of the hardships entailed by the Subehf agreement, from which he wished to withdraw entirely. In August he reported that one of his garrisons had been put to death and that all the others were surrounded by the Subehfs, and craved12 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. assistance in rescuing them. The Resident despatched 50 Sabres of the Aden Troop to support the ’Abdalf, and also lent him rifles and ammunition. These proceedings were approved by Government and resulted in the safe withdrawal of the garrisons. But from this date the Subehi agreement became practically inoperative and the various Subehf tribes have resumed their old position of independent relations with the Aden Residency. Some account of the Subehfs subsequent to this date is given under a separate tribal heading. At the close of 1886 the ’Abdali bought back from the Hau- shabf the lands referred to in the Zaida agreement (No. 1, Appen dix B), and the Resident thereupon intimated to both chiefs that Articles I and II of that agreement were held to be thereby cancelled with the exception of the words permitting the Haushabf to erect a house at A 1 ’Anad. The animosity, always latent, between the ’Abdali and ’Akrabf burst into flames in 1887. The ’Abdalf accused the ’Akrabf of depredations at Waht, and the ’Akrabf retorted with complaints against the Ahl Saila, and accused the ’Abdalf of instigating them near Darb. The ’Azzaiba were drawn into the quarrel, and an attempt to conclude a truce was ineffectual. The ’Akrabf enlisted the services of some Subehfs on his side, and eventually in August the ’Abdalf besieged Bfr Ahmed in a desultory fashion. Finally as plundering began to extend to the British limits at Hiswa, the Resident intervened. The ’Abdalf soldiers evacuated ’Akrabf limits, and the ’Abdalf Sultan reported on the 6th September that peace had been restored. In the early part of the year the ’Abdalf showed a disposi tion to annoy the Subehfs, and by posting men at am-Rija’ endeavoured to maintain a hold on the Ruja’f country : but on the representation of the Resident, the men were withdrawn. The Sultan had also solicited assistance in arms and ammunition with the object of regaining his position with the Subehfs, but the Resident reminded him that the Subehfs had only spared his garrisons in 1886 on the understanding that his suzerainty over them should cease : he might endeavour to conciliate them, but must not expect assistance in coercing them. In June an old feud between the *Ahl Sahl (a quasi independent tribe under ’Abdalf protection at present) and The Ahl Sahl are sub-divided into al-Khodthaira, al-Kurumum, al-’Umairih al-Kuray’a, al-Hawashib, ahl-Hilaibil, and al-Mushahira.THE ’ABDAU'. T 3 the Somati clan of the Subehfs led to mutual reprisals, in which ’Akrabf limits were menaced, but the affair had no serious results. Ahmed bin ’Alf (the Sultan’s brother) visited Aden in April 1888. An almost daily correspond ence was maintained between the Sultan and the Aden Residency on matters of trifling importance. The ’Abdalf continued at times to irritate his neighbours by petty acts of animosity, and in July the Resident found it necessary to have a meeting with him at Shaikh ’Othman and warn him against any intrigues or interference with the ’Akrabf and Fadthlf. Colonel Stace held an interview with the ’Abdalf Sultan at Shaikh ’Othman during which he warned the Sultan not to interfere with the Subehfs, nor to levy taxes on grass, kirby, or vegetables. These taxes were removed accordingly, except that on vege tables. Sultan Ahmed bin ’Alf, the Sultan’s brother, visited Aden and was interviewed by His Excellency Lord Harris, the Governor of Bombay. In September 1890 the’Abdalf Sultan visited Aden and was interviewed by the Resident. The subject of transit duties on grass, etc., was again discussed, also the Slave Treaty. A desultory strife was maintained between the ’Abdali and the Subehfs during the year. The ’Abdalf territory was surveyed by Captain Wahab. A dispute arose with the ’Akrabf over l89I ' 92 ‘ the possession of As Saila and Imran and the extradition of a murderer. Colonel Stace visited As Saila and found that it belonged to the ’Abdalf. He also settled the matter of the murderer. The ownership of Imran was left undecided. Enmity continued between the ’Abdahs and Subehfs with the exception of the Rija’f and Barhimf 1S92-93. tribes. In February 1894, however, a tiuce was proclaimed for one year with all the Subehfs except the Mansurfs. A correspondence had been maintained for some time with the ’Abdali Sultan about a new treat}. The idea was, however, abandoned and the Sultan was informed to that effect when he visited Aden in Febru ary 1893.H ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The Ahl Yahya asked for the ’Abdalf’s protection 1893-94. against the Haushabfs who, they declared, were oppressing them. The Resident, however, declined to recognize the ’Abdalf’s espousal of their grievances. As the Haushabf Sultan was detaining kafilas and levying 1894- 95. unauthorized dues, the ’Abdalf entered the Haushabf country with an armed force. ♦ Mohsin bin ’Alf, the Haushabf Sultan, fled to Taiz and was repudiated by his Shaikhs and tribesmen who elected the ’Abdalf as their ruler. Subsequently Mohsin bin ’Alf gave himself up to the ’Abdalf and accepted an asylum and stipend. After further trouble a reconciliation was effected and the greater part of the Haushabf country was restored to its former ruler. An agreement (No. 11) was signed by the Haushabf and ’Abdalf on the 6th August 1895. A desultory strife was carried on with the Subehfs although 1895- 96. a truce . was proclaimed for a year with the Atiff and Somatf. In June 1895 Sultan Ahmed bin ’Alf, the Sultan’s brother, died. In September the ’Abdali seized some lead belonging to the Akrabi as the latter were trying to evade paying any duty on it, and then burnt some huts at Bir Ahmed. * This matter was settled by the Resident. . In January 1896 Sultan Fadthl bin ’Alt’s salute was increased from 9 to 11 guns and he thereby became entitled to be called His Highness. In April 1896 His Highness the Sultan was interviewed by the Resident at Shaikh ’Othman. He complained that the Turks were diverting the overland trade to Mokha. 1896- 97. . A desultory strife was maintained w &gt;th the Subehis throughout the year. In January 1897 His Highness- the Sultan visited Aden and at an interview with the Resident he asked that his stipend might be paid in rupees instead of dollars. ' A dispute arose between the ’Abdalf and Atiff over the 1897-98. of K,1or Al Umaira to the former. . The latter also complained that the Abdali had bought Ras Al Arab from some ignorant Atifi's I he Abdalf also interfered with the other Subehf tribes whofHE ’ABDALl'. 15 then plundered a caravan. The ’AbdaH was written to but the matter was left unsettled owing to the illness of His High ness the Sultan. His Highness Sultan Fadthl bin ’All died on the 27th April 1898 and was succeeded by his cousin Sultan Ahmed Fadthl. The usual annual stipend was continued to him. Sultan Fadthl bin ’All’s personal salute of 2 extra guns ceased with his death. As the Subehi's continued to plunder caravans and make the trade routes unsafe, the ’Abdalf was granted permission when he visited Aden, to occupy Ras A 1 Arab, Turan and Am Rija’ to protect the trade routes. The Sultan was sent Rs. 4,000 as an aid against famine. The enmity between the’Abdalf and Subehf 1899-1900. continued during the following year. The ’Abdalf however settled his disputes with the Makhdumfs and Mansurfs. Hostilities with the Atiffs continued and it was not till after the ’Abdalf had collected a large force that the Atiffs submitted and peace was declared. Considerable correspondence took place between the Poli tical Resident and the Sultan of Lahej I90 °- about Mahomed Saleh Jafer, the Native Assistant Resident. The latter absconded whilst being tried for corrupt practices and tried to persuade the Subehfs to plunder caravans and ravage the ’Abdalf country. The matter was brought to an end by his death which occurred in the Makhdumf country. The Societe de Tombac endeavoured to persuade the Sultan to allow them to collect dues in his country. Upon the Resident’s advice he refused. The Sultan sent several congratulatory telegrams to Her Majesty the Queen on the success of the British forces in South Africa. The Sultan sent a telegram of condolence to His Majesty King Edward VH on the death of Her 1901-02. Majesty Queen Victoria. A truce was proclaimed with the Subehfs for two months to assist Colonel Wahab’s survey of the Subehf country. His Majesty the King was graciously pleased to appoint Sultan Ahmed Fadthl a K.C.S.I.i6 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The Sultan attended the proclamation of His Majesty King Edward VII as Emperor of India at Delhi on ist Jan uary 1903. He was accompanied by the 'Amir of Dthdla. The Sultan visited Aden and was granted an interview 1903-04 Excellency the Governor of Bom bay. In March 1904 Sultan Munassar bin Mohsin the Sultan’s uncle died. His cousin Mohsin bin ’Abdalla went on a pil grimage to Egypt and Jerusalem, and his brother Mohsin bin Fadthl and ’AH bin Ahmed his son went to India. There was a famine in Lahej this year and the Sultan was sent some pecuniary assistance. The Sultan visited Aden on the occasion of the visit of 1905. ? he Governor of Bombay and was granted an interview with His Excellency. The Sultan was granted a loan of Rs. 20,000 to assist 1906 in the expense of marrying his sons. The wedding festivities took place in Decem ber, at which the Resident deputed one of his Assistants to be present on his behalf. An agreement was concluded between the Sultan and No. 43. Appendix b. ol j| Ri j 4 ’ f Shaikh, under which the Rija’f formally acknowledged himself the vassal of the ’Abdalf. An epidemic of South African Horse sickness broke out at Lahej from which the Sultan’s stables suffered very con siderably. 1 he question of the continuance of a stipend to the Ozebi 1907. Shaikh, the 5 sons of the original grantee haying died, was raised ; and it was eventually decided that the stipend should be continued to Shaikh ’AH Ubaid but cease absolutely upon his death. Some cattle were stolen from the Zariba of the Govern ment contractor at Nobat Dakim; the’Abdalf maintaining the inability of his post of 50 men to prevent robberies by night or recover the property. s In February several ’AbdaH subjects were convicted of smuggling salt in British territory and sentenced to imprison ment and confiscation of their camels, etc. A few days later aTHE ’ABDALf. 1 7 b 744—2 Police Constable was shot at Shaikh ’Othman. Information was received that ’AH bin Saleh the Ozebf, brother of one of the men convicted in the salt case, was the murderer, and as the case was known to have aroused considerable feeling, it seemed not improbable. Unfortunately the informant abscond ed, and, suspicion being diverted to a notorious ’Aulakf criminal, named Ibn Salim A 1 Abd, who was shortly afterwards himself shot in the Hinterland, the mystery remained unsolved. The Sultan who had been suffering from ill-health visited Aden on the 5th March and remained for a week. He took the opportunity to raise the question of extradition and to press for the reciprocity provided for in his earlier treaties on the subject. On the 18th April His Excellency Lord Lamington the Governor of Bombay paid a visit to Lahej and was entertained by the Sultan, until the following afternoon. At an interview, the following were the principal subjects discussed :—Subehf affairs, an irrigation project of the Sultan’s for diverting some of the water of the Wadi Bana into the Tiban, the supply of arms and ammunition, and an increase to the Sultan’s stipend. The Sultan obtained Lord Lamington’s permission to name after him a new Guest House which was in process of erection at Lahej. A request of the Sultan’s for a supply of 500 Martini- Henry rifles in exchange for the same number of Le Gras rifles was negatived by the Government of India, but the latter were asked to reconsider their refusal. In July the Sultan’s two sons ’AH and Fadthl paid a visit to Egypt and Syria. The Sultan visited Aden for change of air in September. He exchanged calls with the Resident.

In 1886 the Subehi were released from the ’Abdali’s control. In the early part of the year the ’Abdalf showed a disposition to annoy the Subehis, and, by posting rnen at Am Rija, endeavoured to maintain a hold on the Rijai country but, on the representation of the Resident, the men were withdrawn. The Sultan also solicited assistance in arms and ammunition with the object of regaining his position with the Subehis, but the Resident reminded him that the Subehis had only spared his garrisons in 1886 on the under standing that his suzerainty over them should cease : he might endeavour to conciliate them, but must not expect assistance in coercing them. There were several thefts of camels from British limits by the Buremi and Mansuri sub-tribes of the Subehf, one being occasioned by the policy of reduced expenditure in presents and entertainments to the tribes : and the stipend of the Mansuri was suspended for a time. Bestitution was obtained in each case. The Dubenf Shaikh died on 6th July 1888 and was suc ceeded by his brother Mahomed bin Darwish, to whom pay ment of the stipend of dollars 42 per annum was sanctioned by Government Resolution No. 7876, Political Department, dated 30th November 1888. In January 1889 Shaikh Mahomed bin Darwish the Dubenf died and was succeeded by his brother Shaikh Hassan bin Imad, the usual annual stipend being continued to him. The Subehfs plundered several caravans during the year and a desultory strife was maintained with the ’Abdalf. Seve ral Shaikhs visited Aden and were given presents. The Subehfs continued to plunder during the following 189091 year. Several of the sub-tribes had their stipends stopped. Protectorate treaties were signed at Aden by the Atiffs and Barhimfs. The feud with the ’Abdalf continued. During this year the Barhimf fixed the rates they would levy for salvage.THE SUBEHl'. 21 On the return of the Manshrf Shaikhs from Aden an attempt was made by the ’Abdalf to way-lay them. They were given an escort and con ducted to their own country. Part of the Subehf country was surveyed by Captain Wahab. Considerable opposition was offered by the Dthambarf, Atiff, Jurabf and A 1 Wahasha tribes and they were punished by having their stipends and presents stopped and being prohibited from entering Aden. This punishment was cancelled in 1893 and the Makh- dumf Shaikh was also restored his stipend l892 ‘ 94, which had been suspended for misconduct. The feud with the ’Abdalf still continued till, in February 1893, the ’Abdalf concluded a truce with all the Subehfs except the Mansurfs. Certain attempts were made by the Societe de Tombac to induce the Atiff and Barhimf Shaikhs to ,4 * 95 ' enter into engagements to check the impor tation of tobacco. The Shaikhs informed the Resident who warned them to keep to the terms of their treaties. Various skirmishes took place between the Subehf and the ’Abdalf and among the sub-tribes. The 1895 97 * ’Abdalf proclaimed a truce for one year with the Atiffs and Somatfs. Shaikh ’Abdalla bin Khodar the Mansurf died and was succeeded by his son Shaikh Saif bin ’Abdalla. The Atiff plundered a Sambuk at Has Al Arab and were ordered to restore what they had stolen. A dispute arose between the ’Abdalf and the Atiffs over the sale of Khor Al Umaira and Ras Al Arab. 1897 98- -j was referred to, but nothing was settled owing to the illness of the ’Abdalf Sultan. As the Subehf continued to plunder caravans and make the trade routes unsafe the ’Abdalf was allow- 1898 ed to occupy Has Al Arab, Turan, and Am Rija The Subehfs agreed to stop the importation of arms into the interior, but made no attempt to carry out the agree ment. Hostilities with the ’Abdalf continued. The Makhdumfs and Mansurfs settled their dispute with the 1899-1900. ’Abdalf but the Atiffs continued to attack22 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. ’Abdali villages, owing to the Sultan’s action in stopping the importation of arms. In November 1899 they attacked the ’AbdaH’s post at Dar A 1 Kudaimf. The ’Abdalf raised a large force upon which the Atiffs submitted and gave hostages. The Atiffs continued to import arms and numerous outrages were committed by the other Subehf tribes. In April 1900 Muhammad Saleh Jafer, the Native Assistant Resident, on being accused of corrupt practices, absconded from Aden and tried to induce the Subehfs to co-operate in plundering the trade routes and ravaging ’Abdalf territory. He died shortly afterwards in the Makhdumf country but the outrages did not cease and they became so serious that steps had to be taken to check them. As the Subehf sti pends are drawn in lieu of transit dues which were formerly levied upon passing caravans it was deemed inadvisable to stop these. And so the ’Abdalf Sultan was advised to raise a sufficient force to effectively suppress the Subehfs and offered certain assistance. An expedition actually started against the Subehfs accordingly but proved fruitless as Government disapproved of Residency interference in the matter, and the ’Abdalf proved unable to proceed unaided. In 1902 and 1903 the Atiffs fired on one of our armed dhows; the Makhdumfs and Mans'drfs looted 263 ’Abdalf camels ; the Somdtfs continually plundered kafilas ; the Jura- bfs sniped our post at Nobat Dakim and an escort was fired on near Dar Akkam. The matter was again referred to Gov ernment, who decided to postpone punitive measures till the Boundary Commission had completed their work. In January 1904, however, Government reconsidered the matter and authorised a punitive expedition provided that the Boundary Commission’s progress would not be hindered thereby. The Commission entered Subehf territory on the 7th February and the expedition was abandoned. The Subehfs were, however, informed that if they offered any opposition they would be attacked immediately. A column was sent from Aden to Dar A 1 Kudaimf to support the Com mission in case of need. On gth February the advance, guard of the escort was fired on by the Khuleff, ’Alawf and Jazirf. They were driven from their position and Dar Ibra him was destroyed by gun-fire. After this except for some sniping by night practically no opposition was experienced. On 3rd March Captain Warneford was murdered at AmTHE SUBEHT. 2 3 Rija by one of the Shaikh ’Othman Police Sowars while on his way to join the Commission as Political Officer. As the Commission moved westwards the heat became too great for British troops. The column at Dar A 1 Kudaimf was withdrawn to Aden and the base and line of supply was chan ged to Ras A 1 Arab which was garrisoned by Native Infantry. The demarcation was completed and the Commission returned to Aden on the 20th of May. In 1901 Shaikh Shahir bin Saif the Mansurf succeeded his father Shaikh Saif ba ’Abdalla. In 1900 Shaikh ’Abdalla ba Hadi the Barhimf succeeded his brother Shaikh Majmas Hadi. In 1902 Shaikh ’Ah' bin Ahmed the Jurabf succeeded his father Shaikh Bughail. Shaikh ’Ah' ba Saleh the A tiff succeeded 1905-06. fois brother Ahmed ba Sdleh. In January 1906 a Government Postal Sowar was shot in British territory and the mails were looted by a party of Atiffs and Yusuffs. With some difficulty the greater part of the mails were recovered, and the surrender of the offenders was demanded. This demand was not complied with and the tribe was accordingly excluded from Aden and their stipend suspended. Said ba ’Alf, Shaikh of the Turan section of the Atiffs who were not concerned in the outrage, was allowed to come into Aden in 1906. The offending section, the Awaidtha, with the Yusuffs, refusing to surrender the offenders remained in outlawry and committed several other petty outrages during the year. There was a feud between the Mansurf and the ’Abdalf. fn March 1906 Captain Warneford’s murderer Saleh ba Haidara the Rijaf was killed by one Rashid Hassan of the Ummaida a semi-independent clan under Mansurf influence. Both the ’Abdalf and the Mansurf claimed that they had brought about the deed, but it was doubtful whether it was not really the outcome of a private quarrel. Disturbances were caused on several occasions on the kdfila routes by disputes among the Dubenfs as to the right of certain Shaikhs to act as mukadams of kdfilas. Ihe Resi dency declined to interfere but asked the Abdalf to effect a settlement.24 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The Rijaf gave some trouble by levying dues to which they were not entitled on kat kdfilas, and the ’Abdalf was asked to re-establish his former post at Am Rija. I hen Awadth ba Salim, the most influential son of the old Rijaf Shaikh died, and the Rijaf concluded an agreement acknow ledging the suzerainty of the ’Abdalf and placing themselves definitely under his protection (October 1906). In June 1906 a dhow flying Italian colours was wrecked and pillaged off the Barhimf coast. The Barhimf Shaikh ’Alf bin Ahmed Am Tommi failing to give satisfaction, he was ordered to pay compensation, pending which his stipend was withheld. The ’Abdalf Sultan was asked to try and effect a settle ment of certain troublesome feuds between the Dubenfs and Juledfs and the Turkish tribe of the Humaida Complaints of Turkish aggression in the Wadf Shaab necessitated representations to the Turkish authorities through the Home Government. Complaints, however, had not entire ly ceased by the close of 1906. An after-effect of the visit of the Boundary Commission to the Subehf country was noticeable in the increasing number of petty Shaikhs visiting Aden ; each generally desiring to be recognised as an independent Akil. Shaikh Said ba ’Alf the Atiff visited Aden in March and upon his disclaiming responsibility for the Awaidtha section of the tribe, Govern ment were addressed with a view to the restoration of his stipend. Government, however, insisted on the re sponsibility of the trine as a whole and decided that the whole Atiff stipend should continu- to be withheld pending atonement for past offences. In the meantime news was received (in July) of the landing of a large consignment of arms at Ras A 1 Arab, the Atiff levying a tax in kind, in spite of Said ba 'Ah’s promises to prevent such importation. When therefore Said ba ’Alf again visited Aden in August he was informed of the decision of Government and dismissed with out a present. During this period two or three raids were made by the Awaidtha section into ’Abdalf territory, and one into British limits, two camels being looted from Shaikh ’Othman.THE SUBEHr. 25 Of the three sub-tribes of the Wahasha, the Mamaf as usual gave no trouble, but the Somatfs were guilty of petty outrages on the caravan routes in June and August. The Juledf feud with the Humaida, however, was the occasion of more fighting in March and the ’Abdalf’s efforts, at our request, to effect a peaceful settlement met with no success owing to the obstinate vindictiveness of the Juledf Shaikh Tmad bin Ahmed. The latter visited Aden in September but was informed of the Resident’s displeasure and told that he could expect no presents nor any favour from us until the disturban ces on the roads, of which he was the cause, had entirely ceased for a definite period. Relations between the Mansurf Shaikh and the ’Abdalf improved and the former visited Aden in February and June. On the latter occasion the Shaikh was given a small loan in addition to his customary presents, on account of drought in his country. The Makhdumf Shaikh visited the Residency along with the Mans drf in February and June. The present given him on the former occasion was, as he was made to understand, smaller than would have been the case but for his failure to make any satisfactory enquiries into the alleged murder of two Somdlfs in his country during the previous year. The old Rijaf Shaikh visited Aden in March and July and was given presents of money and grain. Later he wrote appointing his grandson Saleh bin Awadth his successor, but was told that the Residency could not interfere with the right of the tribe to select their own chief in due course. The mukadamship disputes in the Dubenf tribe were settled through the instrumentality of Shaikh Ahmed Hassan Tahirf who was given a reward in recognition of his services. Shaikh Kasim Mukbil died and was succeeded as Akil of the Mushakf section by his son Haza Kasim. Shaikhs Hassan Tmad and Darwesh Battash visited Aden in January and were threatened wath suspension of stipend on account of the latter’s behaviour in fomenting disturbance amongst the Jurabfs. Later, however, Darwesh Battash rendered good service in bringing about a settlement of a feud between the Attawfs and Mafyahfs (Jurabf) which was recognised by a special present in August. The Jurabfs gave some trouble on the roads consequent on which most of their Shaikhs were summoned to Aden and an endeavour made to get them to agree to the nomination of two26 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. or three Shaikhs as responsible Akils for the whole tribe. This was found impossible, but Sayad Kadri Yasin was appointed as representative of six of the smaller sections, and the number of Attawf Akils recognised by the Residency was reduced to one. The question of the mischievous feud between the Attawf and Mafyahf sections was discussed and subsequently a settlement made with the assistance of the ’Abdalf Sultan and one of the Dubenf Shaikhs. Some petty depredations on the road were committed in September by the Masfarf and Bughailf sections. Shaikh Irjash the Buremf, after being refused a present by the Residency in August, looted two ’Abdalf camels. For this Shaikh Alawi bin ’Alf was called on to make reparation and did so. Government decided that the Barhimf Shaikh should be required to make good Rs. 2,450 paid as compensation for the loot of the dhow “ Assab ” and that, until he did so, his stipend should be entirely withheld. The Shaikh was informed accord- ingly. It transpired that Shaikh ’Abdul Kawi’s account of Turkish on th e Shaab border was much exaggerated and that it was at his own instigation in one instance that certain of his tribesmen had been detained in Turkish territory, regard ing which he had complained bitterly to us, and on his visiting Aden in August he was given to understand that the Resident was much displeased at his double dealing and he was dismiss ed without a present.The Akrabi. The territory occupied by the ’Akrabi tribe is of small area. The coast line extends from the Khor or Creek of Bfr Ahmed to Ras ’Imran, whilst inland the possessions of the tribe reach to an undetermined point between the villages of Bir Ahmed and Waht, and situated in the “ Khabt,” or desert tract, which forms a debateable land between the territories of the ’Abdalf and ’Akrabf chiefs. The exact boundaries of the two districts have never yet been accurately laid dowm, and the Khabt especially is looked upon as common property. Though un cultivated it produces wood, potash and forage for camels, and is, therefore, regarded as a desirable possession. There are about 250 fighting men in the ’Akrabf tribe, most of whom reside at Bfr Ahmed. A few The people. families live at Hiswa in British territory and at Darb in the ’Abdalf district. Though small in point of numbers, the ’Akrabf tribe bears a high reputation for courage. The income of the ’Akrabf chief is chiefly derived from jowari and kirbf produced in his district. Revenues. j n orc ij nar y y ears 0 f rainfall he obtains about 200 dollars. In extraordinary years it may reach to 600 dollars. Transit dues used to yield an estimated revenue of 600 dollars per annum, exclusive of the stipend paid by the British Government. The rates of duties were as under On every camel load of coffee ... Dollar £ Do. jowari ... Annas 2 Do. vegetables... Anna 1 No dues were levied on goods passing out of Aden. Owing to gradual diversion of trade the ’Akrabf has latterly derived little or no revenue from transit dues. There is one Kadthf for the ’Akrabf district, who, however, only exercises jurisdiction in matrimo- Administration. n j a l matters. All criminal and civil cases are disposed of by the ’Akrabi chief according to custom. In cases of “ wilful murder,” “manslaughter,” or “death by misadventure,” if the murderer be merely an Akrabi subject, the Shaikh has the power to put him to death or fine him. If he be a tvibesyncin, the punishment is imprisonment, fine, and expulsion. At the same time a truce for a fixed period is made betw r een the murderer and the deceased s relatnes, at28 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. the expiry of which the latter may retaliate, unless the truce be extended. In case of wounds inflicted a fine is imposed, which is fixed on the report of three men appointed by the chief, but no part of the fine goes to the injured party.

The latter reside in Bfr Ahmed. The ’Akrabf were Historical Resume. the year 1770. The fallen into their hands, formerly a tribe subject to the ’Abdalf. Under the leadership of Shaikh Mehdf they threw off their allegiance about ruined fort of Bfr Ahmed, which had } , was restored, and several efforts of the ’Abdalf to regain it were futile, owing to the assistance given by the hadthlf to the ’Akrabf. The ’Akrabf became thence forward de facto independent. On the 4th February 1839, within a month of the capture of Aden, an engagement (No LV) was entered into with Shaikh Haidara Mehdf, which was adhered to until the third attack upon the fortress in July 1840. Ihe ’Akrabf, under the influence probably of the Fadthlf chief, reversed their previous line of conduct, and became steadily antagonistic to British interests, until their hostility culminated in 1850 in the murder of a seaman of the “ Auckland.” This necessitated the blockade, for several years, of the port of Bfr Ahmed, and friendly relations were not resumed till 1837 wdien the chief renewed (No. LVI) his professions of peace and goodwill. In 1863 negotiations were commenced with this tribe for the acquisition of the peninsula of Jebel Ihsan, or as it is usual y called, Little Aden. The chief was unwilling to dispose of it, but entered into an agreement (No. LVII) not to sell, mortgage, or give for occupation any portion of the peninsula, save to the British Government. He thereupon received an immediate payment of 3,000 dollars and a monthly stipend of 30 dollars, under the obligation of protecting British subjects residing in, or passing through, his territory, and of maintaining peace and friendship with the Government. These terms were not considered entirely satisfactory by he Home authorities and the Resident was instructed to treat or the complete and unreserved acquisition of the peninsula.the 'akrabi'. 29 After tedious negotiations, which were further protracted by the necessity of investigating the claims of other tribes to the territory, the purchase was concluded (No. LVIII) on 2nd April 1869 for a sum of 30,000 dollars, the stipend of the chief being at the same time raised to 40 dollars per mensem. Between the years 1833 and 1858 Shaikh Haidara Mehdf was the ruling ’Akrabf chief. This chief did not die until 1865, but he resigned the chieftainship in favour of his son ’Abdalla ba Haidara Mehdf, in 1858. The latter’s independ ence of the ’Abdalf was acknowledged by the Government of India. The ’Abdalf has gradually deprived the ’Akrabf of all revenue from transit dues; and more than once caused them some inconvenience by cutting off the stream of the Wadf-al- Kabfr before it reached Bfr Ahmed, and by instigating the Subehf and the Ahl Saila to commit mischief. During the year 1885 the chronic feud between the ’Akrabf and the Ahbas-Saila (also called the 1885 and 1886. ’Akarib-Saila) assumed an acute stage and led to some plundering on the British border. The Native Assistant was sent out and succeeded in establishing a year’s truce. At the commencement of 1886 a survey was effected of the territories claimed and occupied by the ’Akrabf, but it was found impossible to adjust the conflicting claims of the Subehfs, the ’Abdalf, and the ’Akrabf, the latter possessing no real control over a considerable district to which he lays claim. The animosity, always latent, between the ’Abdalf and ’Akrabf burst into flames in 1887. The ’Abdalf accused the ’Akrabf of depredations at Waht, and the ’Akrabf retorted with complaints against the Ahl Saila, and accused the ’Abdalf of instigating them near Darb. The ’Azzaiba were drawn into the quarrel, and an attempt to conclude a truce was ineffectual. The ’Akrabf enlisted the services of some Subehfs on his side, and eventually in August the ’Abdalf besieged Bfr Ahmed in a desultory way. Finally, as plundering began to extend to the British limits at Hiswa, the Resident intervened. The ’Abdalf soldiers evacuated ’Akrabf limits, and the ’Abdalf Sultan reported on the 6th September that peace had been restored. In June an old feud between the Ahl Sahl (a quasi-in dependent tribe under ’Abdalf protection at present) andARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. 30 the Somatf clan of the Subehfs led to mutual reprisals, in which ’Akrabf limits were menaced, but the affair had no serious results. 1 he negotiations commenced in the beginning of 1887 for l888 the acquisition of a strip of foreshore to connect the British limits at A 1 Hiswa and Bandar Fukum were brought to a satisfactory conclusion by an agreement dated 15th July 1888, the ’Akfabf Shaikh disposing of his title for an immediate payment of Rs. 2,000.

The ’Akrabf’s stipend was stopped and they were excluded 1892- 93. from Aden, for refusing to give up some men who had imported arms. Several complaints were received by the Resident that 1893- 94.

The former I9 ° s - Shaikh’s brother ’All, who had aspired to succeed, endeavoured to induce the Residency to interfere on his behalf but without success. In February the Shaikh paid a visit to H. M.

In February the Shaikh’s brother Mohsin bin 'Abdalla when under the influence of drink, killed 19 ° 7 ' two of his cousins and afterwards shot himself. In June the ’Akrabf formally prohibited the drinking of any alcoholic liquor by his subjects, and asked our assistance to prevent the sale of toddy to them at Hiswa. In the same month two M. H. carbines sanctioned by Government were presented to the Shaikh. The Shaikh visited Aden in September and was accorded an interview by the Resident. At the present time (1907) the old feud between ’Abdalf and ’Akrabf has ceased to exist, and the present young Shaikh Fadthl ba ’Abdalla is almost entirely under the influence of the ’Abdalf Sultan.The Fadthli. The territory occupied by the Fadthlf tribe is of consider able extent haying a coast line that stretches from the eastern boundary of British limits near ’Imad till it touches the western boundary of the ’Aulakl tribe at Makatfn, a hundred miles distant 1 he country is divided into two large districts—the ow lands of Abyan, of which the greater portion formerly e onged to the Yafaf tribe, and the high lands of the north east which are inhabited by several warlike and intractable sub-tribes. I he geological formation of Abyan appears to be similar to that of Lahej; and some tracts, where the alluvium is not covered by dnftsand, are of greater fertility, producing when required, an abundant yield of red and white jowari and sesame. Amongst the hills to the north-west, which are composed of stratified rocks, a certain amount of wheat is raised in addition to jowari; whilst myrrh trees, the produce of which is gathered by Somalis, grow in abundance upon the limestone heights, which strikingly resemble the incensebear- V, S pT, 3 ,^ th L e °PP osite coast - ^ the arts of agriculture he Fadthl, are behind the ’Abdalf, but they possess between the Bana and the Hasan a tract of country capable of yielding the most abundant returns to cultivation. ^ The Fadthlf are a proud, warlike and independent race, The people. and possess in a high degree the mi, • i virtues and vices of the true Bedawtn They are quick to take offence, and are vindictive Ind treacherous enemies ; but, their friendship once secured thev are said to be trustworthy.

On the whole, considerable laxity of morals appears to prevail amongst these mountaineers. The popula tion is estimated at under 20,000, of whom about 500 reside at Shukra. The fighting men number about 6,800. A state ment, hereto annexed, gives a list of the principal Shaikhs. The system of land revenue in the Fadthlf district differs Revenues. from that in the ’Abdalf, the country being theoretically the property of the Sultan, who exacts about half the produce from the tenants. The cultivated area being small, and the outlying hill tribes not under the complete control of the Sultan, his income from this source is small. Inclusive of the annual stipend from the British Government, 10,000 dollars may be regarded as the utmost revenue derivable from all sources. Of the total, land revenue contributes about 450 dollars ; revenue from harka (a species of khar or potash used for washing purposes as well as in the preparation of tobacco and snuff) yields 7,000 dollars ; import and export dues 400 dollars ; taxes on kafilas 1,100 dol lars ; proceed s of land cultivated by the Sultan on his own account 800 dollars ; whilst fees on shop-keepers make up the remaining 250 dollars. Transit dues, which used to yield from 3,000 to 4,000 dollars, were abolished by the agreement of 1872 (No. LXII). . ' The Fadthlf chief has under his nominal suzerainty a large Administration. nUm ’ 5er ° f tr i ibeS J ! but ^ a limite d number are his full subjects. There are two Kadthfs—one at Shukra and one at A 1 ’Asala—who adjudicate on cases occurring in their respective districts. Cases between subjects are adjudicated by the Kadlhfs, and the chief enforces their decisions if necessary. When one subject causes the wilful murder of another subject, or manslaughter, or death by misadventure, the punishment is death or payment of the “ diya” of 750 dollars, or 100 she-camels, according to the choice of the injured side. Wounds inflicted also necessitate the payment of “diya,” or blood-money varying with the nature and extent of the wounds. When one tribesman kills another tribesman, the accept ance of “ diya” is not customary. When a tribesman kills a subject, the chief himself, and not the Kadthf, adjudicates. In such cases, the punishment of death is not inflicted, but the subject is- obliged to accept “diya”; but when a subject kills a tribesman, the latter’s relations may exercise the choice of killing the murderer in lieu of accepting “diya”. « 744—334 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN.

The Fadthli are divided into about 24 sub-tribes, the Sub-tribes. principal of which are the Markashi, Allaha, Ahl Hanash, Ahl Hasana and Dathma. The Markashi possess a large slice of the eastern seaboard, and reside in the hills, which in that quarter approach close to the sea. They claim descent from the ancient Himyarites, and are justly considered the flower of the Fadthlf tribe. The Dathma and Ahl Hasana belong to the Upper \Aulakf stock, and were formerly under the chief of that tribe, but became subject to the Fadthlf in the time of Sultan Ahmed bin ’Abdalla. A list of the sub-divisions of the Fadthlf tribe is given in the accompanying statement. The origin of the Fadthlf is lost in tradition. It is stated Historical Resume. a bout 300 years ago a Sayyid , , brought from Constantinople an Arab woman with child by a Sultan of'Turkey. She landed at Shukra, and proceeded to Surraiha, where her child was born and named Osman. This child being intelligent was on reach ing puberty selected by the Markashf tribesmen as their Sultan and begot a child named Fadthl, from whom the Fadthlf derive their name. Between Fadthl (who became Sultan after his father Osman) and Abdalla (who became Sultan in 1780! there were several other Fadthlf chiefs, but their names cannot be ascertained. Sultan Abdalla died in 1805, and was sue hv^AM V f ’r''! 10 d ‘ ed ‘o l819 - Ahraed was succeeded by Abdalla, who died in ,828, and was succeeded by Ahmed the Sultan, with whom the British had to deal when Aden became a British possession. The Fadthlf do not appear to have ever been subject to the ’Imams of San’a. F Soon after the capture of Aden, the Fadthlf entered into a bond of friendship with the British Government and were guaranteed a stipend of thirty dollars per mensem during good behaviour, but for many years they were our persistent and implacable enemies. Their conduct must to a great extent be attributed to the influence of their chief, Sultan Ahmed InnTHE FADTHLl'. 35 ’Abdalla. This chief’s sultanship over the Fadthli tribe extend ed from 1828 to 1870, and from the day that Aden fell into our hands until the last years of his life, he never swerved from the line of policy which he conceived to be most antago nistic to our interests, instigating every attack upon Aden and being ever ready to afford an asylum to the perpetrators of the atrocities which through a course of several years were pro ductive of much difficulty and embarrassment. The expedition against Shaikh ’Othman in 1858 (which has been narrated in the foregoing historical resum6 of the ’Abdalf) had temporarily a good effect upon the Fadthlf as upon other tribes in the vicinity. The Sultan of Lahej had been in the habit of paying annually sums of money to the neighbouring tribes through whose territory the trade of the country passed, and these payments were continued by the British Government on condition of the chiefs remaining in friendly alliance. From the weakness of the character of the ’Abdalf chief ’Ah' Mohsin, through whom it was the early policy of the Political Agent to transact all business with the Arabs near Aden, the neighbouring tribes ventured for some years to perpetrate a series of attacks upon individual British officers and others which the Sultan was quite unable to prevent or punish. In consequence of the powerlessness of the ’Abdali Sultan a change was effected in the policy of dealing with the tribes, and since 1858 intercourse with the chiefs has been held direct, instead of through the Sultan of Lahej. The conciliatory policy pursued by Brigadier-General Coghlan towards the Fadthlf chief served to all appearances to allay for several years the animosity which, it was afterwards proved, only required an opportunity to break out again in all its former intensity. The conduct of Sultan Ahmed bin ’Abdalla at the wreck of the “ Statelie ” in January 1864 earned the approbation of Government; but soon afterwards, either from dissatisfaction at the amount of the reward granted to him for his services on this occasion, or out of jealousy at the intimacy of British relations with the Sultan of Lahej, he resumed his attitude of persistent hostility. Within gunshot of the fortifica tions of Aden he plundered a caravan, and assembled a large force with the object of destroying the crops of the ’Abdalf and defying the authority of the British Government. A small force was accordingly despatched against him in December 1865 : he was defeated, and compelled to seek safety in flight,ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. 3 6 while the troops entered the Fadthli country and destroyed several villages. The seaport of Shukra was at first spared, in hopes that the punishment already administered would prove sufficient. But some further outrages having been perpetrated, a small force left Aden by sea on the 14th March 1866, destroyed the forts inland, and returned within three days to Aden,—thus showing the Fadthlf that they could be ap proached by land or sea with equal facility. It was determined that either the chief or his son should enter Aden and tender unconditional submission before friendly relations could be resumed. All other overtures were declined, and in March 1867 a letter was received from the chief, stating his wish to send his elder son to tender the submission of the tribe. A safe conduct was granted, and Sultan Haidara entered Aden. Eventually, on the 25th May, Sultan Ahmed’s two sons Haidara and Husain and his brother Saleh came into Aden with the proposed treaty (No. LI) signed and sealed. This treaty has been authoritatively declar ed to be the only one now in force. Shortly after the ratifica tion of the treaty the stipend of the Fadthlf chief was raised by the Government of India from 30 dollars to 100 dollars per mensem, the former sum being considered d isproportionate to his rank and position. Sultdn Haidara remained in Aden for some time until he was replaced by a near relation of the chief as a permanent hostage ; but the Fadthlf tribe on the whole loyally adhering to their engagements, on the death of the hostage in August 1870 the Secretary of State for India was pleased, in consideration of their good conduct, to permit the fourth article of the treaty to remain in abeyance. Sultdn Ahmed bin ’Abdalla died on the 3rd February 1870, and was succeeded by his eldest son Haidara. He was of a mild and amiable disposition sincerely anxious to do right and govern well, a somewhat difficult task in consequence of the old predatory instincts of the tribe and the headstrong conduct of his brother Sultan Husain. Some trouble was caused by the defection of the large and warlike sub-tribe of the Marakisha, who on account of some fancied grievance took refuge with Sultan ’Alf bin Mani’ the Haushabf, but by mild measures and good advice a reconciliation was soon effected. of In May 1872 an engagement was concluded in the the Political Resident Major-General Tremenhere, presence wherebyI THE FADTHLf. 37 Part of this royalty is paid to the Ahl ’Atiyya sub tribe of the Yafai. the Yafaf Sultan consented to accept a royalty* of 25 dollars per annum from the Fadthlf for the use of water derived from the rivulet of Ndzi’a for irrigational purposes. The Fadthlf chief on his part agreed for a commutation, at 80 dollars per mensem, to abolish transit dues through his territory, thus freeing the road to and from Aden of all vexatious cesses. This agreement (No. LII) received the ratification of the Governor General in December 1872. The Yafaf, however, repudiated the agreement regarding the Nazi’a, which led to protracted hostilities, suspended at times by truces ; and to mark Government’s sense of the breach of faith of the Yafaf, the payment of the Yafaf’s stipend was withheld in the latter part of 1872, but in 1876 a satisfactory settlement of the matter was effected. On the 23rd August 1877, Sultdn Haidara bin Ahmed was assassinated. It was believed, and with reason, that his brother Sultan Husain was the murderer. The tribe, headed by the murderer’s son Ahmed, rose and drove Sultan Husain forth. Ahmed bin Husain was elected Sultan, and recognised by Government. At the time of his succession, Sultan Ahmed bin Husain was only between fifteen and sixteen years of age, and was guided in his counsels by his uncles Mehdar and ’Abdalla bin Nasir. The outlawed Sultan Husain found refuge with the Ahl Hasana sub-tribe, and soon commenced to intrigue and stir up the whole Fadthlf country. The young chief applied for and obtained assistance, but his operations against his father were of a feeble character, and Sultan Husain continuing to gain fresh partisans, the despatch of the Aden Troop by land and H. M.’s ship “ Ready ” by sea to A 1 Harkd in the beginning of 1879 was sanctioned. After a few hours’ assault, Sultan Husain and his followers gave them selves up, and were escorted into Aden, and on 24th July 1879 he was sent as a political prisoner to Bombay, thus ridding the Fadthlf country of a most lawless and desperate character. The boundary dispute, so fruitful a source of dissension between the ’Abdalf and Fadthlf, was happily settled by the signature, on 25th June 1881, of a treaty between the two tribes defining the boundary. A copy of this treaty is attached (Appendix B).38 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY UE ADEN. In the beginning of 1883 dissensions broke out between the hauthlf and Lower ’Aulakf, the cause of dispute being an old blood feud of many years’ standing, and the passage of Lower ’Aulakf troops lent to the ’Abdalf Sultan through the Fadthlf limits without the permission first obtained of the Fadthlf chief. The Fadthlf was for several months kept in a state of suspense threatened by the concentration of a large force of the Lower ’Aulakf on his frontier. Demonstrations off the coast by H. M.’s ship “ Dragon ” and the despatch of patrolling parties of the Aden Troop in the Fadthlf districts failed to induce the Lower ’Aulakf to disband his forces. At length, believing that the Lower ’Aulakf had actually started to enter his districts, the Fadthlf appealed to the Political Resident, and on the 19th April 1883 a force of Native Infantry with two camel mounted guns was despatched to sea by Shukra in the I. G. steamer “ Amberwitch ’’escorted by H. M.’s ship “ Dragon,” while 50 sabres of the Aden Troop proceeded by land. Finding on arrival that no actual invasion ot r adthlf territory had occurred, the force sent by sea returned immediately to Aden, the detachment of the Aden Troop remaining in the Fadthlf district. Shortly after the withdrawal of the force, the Lower ’Aulakf invaded the Fadthlf territory* but the attack resulted in the complete discomfiture of the Aulaki, who retreated to their own country with considerable loss in killed and wounded. During 1885 an d 1886 the Markashfs and Aydl Fadthl 1885 an d 1886. kept alive their long-standing quarrel. The Sultdn frequently visited Aden Agitation for the liberation of the State-THE EADTHLt 39 During the year 1887 the Fadthli Sultan complained ol Soon' fishermen fishing off his coasts without paying dues. A reference was made to the Political Agent at Muscat; but, owing to the extreme vagueness of the Fadthli’s complaint, the matter was allowed to drop. The Fadthlf chief visited Aden in April on his way to Mecca on pilgrimage. At Jidda, on the return voyage, he and some of his suite were stricken with small-pox. The chief returned to Aden in November. During the chief’s absence the affairs of the district were attended to by his father Sultdn Husain (formerly a State- prisoner). The latter also visited Aden twice, and his conduct has given no cause for uneasiness. He has devoted much attention to cultivation and irrigation. The Fadthli Sultdn visited Aden in May and again in August 1888, and his father Sultan Husain also visited Aden in July. The relations between the Fadthli Sultan and his father Husain being at one time very strained, the Resident invited them both to Aden to discuss their differences. A disagree ment in regard to the sale of potash appeared to be the princi pal matter of contention, but the Fadthlf did not fail to impute various aggressive acts to his father. By the media tion, however, of the most influential Shaikhs, father and son came to an amicable understanding in the presence of the Resident. The Political Resident landed at Shukra in February 1888 and remained ten days in the Fadthlf country. Crossing the hills by Amzuk, the well-cultivated valley of Yaramis was visited, the produce of which is estimated at 30,000 pailis (about 150,000 lbs.) of jowari. The district is supposed to contain 4,000 camels, 10,000 sheep and goats, and 500 cattle. Passing to the north of the A 1 Kadam range, the Abyan country was visited, and the Resident inspected Sultdn Husain’s irrigation works at A 1 Kavvr. 1.000 acres of land, which had been lying waste for years, had been brought under cultivation. In consequence of territorial disputes between the Lower Yafaf and the Fadthlf and the building by the latter of a fort at Bfr Majhar, the Yafaf cut off the supply from the Nazi’a.40 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. l88g Numerous skirmishes took place with the Yafaf during the year. The Fadthlf and Lower ’Aulakf Sultans came to Aden and the Resident endeavoured to settle the outstanding dispute be tween them. As this could not be done without undue inter ference in intertribal affairs, the matter had to be left unsettled. Mr. Dunn, Civil Engineer, visited the Fadthlf country to report on its irrigation. i890 . 9 , The Fadthlf Sultan journeyed to Baghdad via Aden and Bombay. i he strife with the Yafaf continued. Some of the Markashfs killed several camels at Shaikh 1891 92. ’Othman. As the Fadthlf Sultan failed to arrest them, his stipend was stopped and a fine was imposed upon him part of which was afterwards remitted when the Sultdn visited Aden. The Fadthlf country was surveyed by Captain Wahab. A desultory strife continued with the Yafaf varied by short truces. Sultan Nasir bin Mohsin the Sultan’s brother died.

The truce with the Yafaf was renewed for another year.THE FADTHLi 41 A few skirmishes took place with the Lower ’Aulakf. Mr. Theodore Bent visited the Fadthli country on a scientific expedition. The Sultan visited Aden and asked for some ammunition as his magazine had been blown up. Hostilities with 1898-99. the Lower Yafaf were recommenced. Sultan Husain bin Ahmed, the Fadthlf Sultan’s father, went to Bombay to visit Hyderabad. Sultans Saleh and ’Abdalla, the Fadthlf Sultan’s brothers, were brought to Aden as prisoners to prevent their intriguing any more against the Sultan. They were afterwards removed to Karachi under Government orders. They appealed to be released but the Fadthlf Sultan when he visited Aden requested that they might be detained. In April 1900 S&amp;leh bin Husain died at Karachi and at the Fadthlf Sultan’s request ’Abdalla bin Husain was allowed to return to his country. In April of this year the Sultan visited Aden on his way to Jidda on a pilgrimage. He returned in November and began to levy dues on kafilas contrary to the treaty of 1872, and erected a custom house at Zanjibar (A 1 Mahal) diverting all traffic through that place. In consequence the Lower Yafaf and Lower ’Aulakf complained and the former cut off the water from the Nazi’a Channel. This led to mutual reprisals and attacks were made by the Fadthlf on A 1 Husan and A 1 Rawa in 1903. In November of that year the Resident ordered Colonel Abud to go to El Khamila and discuss the matter with the Fadthlf and Yafaf chiefs. This project fell through as the Lower Yafaf Sultan refused to attend the conference. Reprisals continued and in January 1904 the Fadthlfs attacked Raha in Yafaf territory but weie repulsed. They also fired on a Lower ’Aulakf Sambuk. The Resident demanded an explanation and eventually in October 1904 the Sultan visited Aden. In an interview with the Political Resident he agreed to discontinue the levying of all dues except such fees as were willingly paid to him by merchants for escorts furnished to them for protection beyond his own limits. To the collection of these fees .exception was not taken provided that they were collected at Shukra on passes furnished by the merchants concerned, and that the payments were made voluntarily in consideration of protection actually afforded beyond hadthlf1906- 42 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. territories. The Sultan agreed that the collection of dues at Zanjibar itself should accordingly cease. Thereupon the Sultan’s stipend which had been stopped was restored to him. Shortly afterwards the Fadthlf attacked and occupied Khanfer a village in Yafai territory. In November 1904 the Fadthlf and Lower ’Aulakf proclaim ed a truce for two months pending a meeting between the two Sultans for the purpose of settling their feud'. In April Rs. 1,000 were given to the Sultan as assistance I905&gt; towards the repair of his irrigation bunds. In September Colonel Scallon, Acting Political Resident, paid a visit to Shukra. In December the Sultan’s son ’Othman made a pilgrimage to Mecca. Government sanctioned the presen tation to the Sultan of 5 M.H. carbines. The Sultan’s health throughout the year was poor. The Sultdn denied the 'truth of information received by the Residency to the effect that he had failed to keep his promise to cease the collection of dues at Zanjibar. Sultan Ahmed bin Husain whose health had been bad for lg0 7. some time died. There were two candidates for the succession, his brother Othman and his father Husain bin Ahmed. The latter was eventually elected by the tribe without disturbance, and his succession was acknowledged by Government. Inquiry into the alleged breach of the late Sultan’s undertaking not to collect transit dues was suspended on the accession of his successor. His Excellency the Governor of Bombay paid a visit to Shukra on the 15th April and was suitably entertained by the new chief Sultan Husain bin Ahmed. The continuation of the Fadthlf stipend to the newly elected Sultan was formally sanctioned by Government in June 1907. ’Abdul Kadir, the minor son of the late Sultan Ahmed Husain, wrote to complain of his grandfather Sultan Husain’s usurpation and asked permission to come and lay his Griev ances before the Resident. The letter was sent 'to fhe Shiltan to whom it was suggested to bring the boy with him when he next visited Aden.The Haushabh The Haushabi country is bounded on the north by the hills occupied by the Da’irf and Dthambari asp^’tc^™ 46 ’ (independent tribes), the ’Alawf district, and the Mihrabf and Ahmedf tribes (who are subject to the Porte), on the west by the Yusifi and Kubatf tribes (both under Turkish rule), on the south by the Makhdumf, a sub-tribe of the Subehf and a portion of the ’Abdalf and Fadthli territories. On the east lies the Yafai district. Most of the Haushabf territory is hilly, except in the south, where it is sandy desert. Camels, cattle, goats and sheep are reared by the tribesmen. Jowari is also grown. The river Toban flows through the district from north to south, and is perennial. On the hills are bushes of babul and rakh, the latter of which is browsed on by camels. About 1,400 “ dthimds ” (acres) are under cultivation, chiefly in the bed of the river. The climate is healthy, except in the neighbourhood of the river, where fever and dropsy are common. The area of the district is about 1,800 square miles. The population is estimated at 7,000 souls. The principal The people. villages are Ar-Raha with 500 inhabi tants ; Harur with 300 ; and Musemfr with 200. Most of the Haushabf are nomads, who wander about in search of grazing and water for their live stock. They are all tribesmen. There are nine principal Shaikhs, each having from one to three hundred followers. The fighting strength of the tribe is about 2,000. Some few occupy themselves in cultivating and driving camels. The Haushabi have no special characteristics distinguishing them from the ordinary Bedawm of the maritime plain. ^Corre- sponding to the sub-divisions of the tribe there are ten districts — Dar Shaiban, Namara, Habfl-al-Majar, Nobat Dakim, Hisn Haitan, Sulaik, Hadwan, Sha b-al-Kadha, Marfb and Ar- Raha. The latter is the usual residence of the Sultan • the others are ruled by chiefs. The annual revenue of the Haushabi Sultan is about 3,^00 Revenues. dollars, principally derived from land tax and transit dues, the latter being levied at the following rates : —I THE HAUSHABI'. 45 For every camel-load of jowari ... i^ths of a dollar.

For every camel-load of wheat and other unenumerated produce The Sultan receives annually from the British subsidy of 648 dollars. Therp is only one Kadthf in the whole Haushabf district ; he resides at Ar-Raha, and only per forms marriage ceremonies. When anyone has a claim, civil or criminal, against another, he lays it before the Sultan, who decides it according to custom. His decision is final and binding on both parties. As regards punishment of theft and the various kinds of homicide, the Haushabf follow the ’Alawf customs, which will be found in the account of that tribe. The genealogy of the present ruling family will be found in Appendix D. An ancestor of the present Sultan was formerly governor of the Haushabi district on behalf of the Historical Resume. ’Imam of San’a. Failing to pay tribute he was attacked, but succeeded in making himself independent. In the engagement the chief split his opponent’s drum with his jambia, by which he earned the sobriquet of Fajari (breaker). The name of Haushabf was that of a soldier under the above- mentioned Fajari, whose descendants to this day are called Haushabf-Fajari. Soon after the capture of Aden an engagement (No. LXVI) was entered into with Sultan Mani’ bin Salam, the chief of the Haushabf, of the same tenor as the ’Abdalf, Fadthlf and Yafaf bonds. Sultan Mani’ bin Salam, though more than once invited by the ’Abdalf and Fadthlf chiefs to join them in their attacks upon Aden, steadily declined their overtures, and further showed his good will towards the British by refusing to afford an asylum in his territories to the murderers of Captain Milne in 1851. Sultan Mani’ bin Salam died on the 1st June 1858, and was succeeded by his nephew Obaid bin Yehya, during whose46 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. rule friendly relations were uninterruptedly maintained with the Haushabf. Obaid bin Yehya died in 1863, and was succeeded by his cousin ’AH bin Mani\ The attitude of Sultdn ’Ah' bin Mani’ was at first the reverse of friendly. In 1868 he cut off the supply of water from a rivulet which irrigated the Lahej territory, and destroyed crops on lands belonging to the Sultan of Lahej, who accordingly marched against him. An action ensued, in which the Haushabi was defeated. In payment of the loss suffered by the bultan of Lahej, Sultan ’Alf bin Mani’ ceded to him the town of Zaida and its lands, which had formerly belonged to Lahej, and the dispute was temporarily settled by the friendly intervention of the Resident. In consequence of outrages committed by him on the Aden road, the Haushabf’s stipend was stopped in October 1869; the proximate cause of this misconduct was the tenure of Zaida by the Sultan of Lahej, who was, therefore, induced to make over to his rival a small portion of that district. But the Haushabi' chief was not satisfied, and in 1873 commenced intriguing with the Turkish authorities at Ta’izz, in the hope of thereby regaining possession of Zaida. Supported by Turkish troops he held for some time a part of Zaida, but on their withdrawal from the neighbourhood of Lahej' was compelled to retire. The ’Abdalf Sultan was induced by the Resident to renew his offers of a portion of Zaida to the Haushabf chief; but as the latter insisted on receiving the fort of Shak’aa, which commands the rivulet and consequently the supply of water to Lahej, the negotiations failed at the time, but were renewed with success subsequently, and causes of disagreement between the Haushabi' and ’Abdalf were subsequently terminated by the signature, on 14th July 1881, of an agreement (copy of which has already been referred to in the account of the ’Abdalf), whereby a portion of the Zaida lands was restored to the Haushabi'. ’Alf bin Mani’ visited Aden in February 1885. During 1885 and 1886. the first half of the year complaints were constantly made by the Haushabf against the Abdali, who was accused of plundering crops in the Zaida lands, preventing their cultivation and interfering with the 'Amin tribesmen, whose fort at Dar-al-Huwaimf he demolished. A truce, however, was established for one yearTHE HAUSHABl'. 47 The Resident visited the territory of the Haushabf on his way to Dthala and, in the illness of ’Ah' bin Mani’, was courteously received by his son Mohsin. In January 1886 the Haushabf, accompanied by his son Mohsin, visited Aden. This year was marked by several depredations committed near Al-’Anad and Nobat Dakim, in some instances by Subehis, and before matters could be settled ’AH bin Mani’ died (on the 4th May) and was succeeded by his son Mohsin, a young man, to whom the stipend enjoyed by his father was continued by Government Resolution No. 3992, Political Department, dated 14th July 1886. Mohsin bin ’AH visited Aden in July and was suddenly recalled to his country by the misconduct of the Ahl Yehya. In September the Resident was apprized of the sale by the Haushabf of his lands at Zaida to the ’Abdalf for 5,000 dollars, and the Resident thereupon intimated to both chiefs that Articles I and II of the Zaida agreement (No. 1, Appendix B) were held to be thereby abrogated with the exception of the words permitting the Haushabf to build a house at Al-’Anad. After his accession the Resident was obliged repeatedly to urge the young Haushabf chief to exercise a proper control in his territories, especially near Al-’Anad, and to make restitution for plunders committed in his limits. The Haushabf chief visited Aden in February and again in October, and some advice was l887 ‘ tendered to him on his behaviour, which had been unsatisfactory. Compensation for depreda tions committed on a kafila at the close of 1886 by inhabitants of Shak’aa and Khilaf remained unpaid: and complaints of the levy of enhanced taxes and the forcing of the trade-route to Al-Milah via Al-’Anad were received. The Haushabf stated that the routed Ar-Raha was unsafe in consequence of the hostility of the Dthambarfs, and promised a settlement of the matter after communication with the more influential kafila mukadams at Al-Jalfla and Al-Munadf. The young Sultan solicited assistance in building a fort at Al-Tanan (about 6 miles north of Nobat Dakim) ; but, as there was ground to fear that its construction, without adding to the safety of the road, would be used to levy an■■■■■■■■■ 48 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. additional tax on kafilas, the Resident declined to countenance the building. The Sultan maintained communications with the Turkish officials at Ta’izz, and the monthly allowance of 40 dollars paid to his father was continued by them to him. In April 1888 the Haushabf complained of an attack by ig88 some Subehfs, but it appeared on enquiry that he had provoked it by the uncalled for maltreatment of some Makhdumfs. The levy of enhanced dues by the Haushabf at the close of 1886 was followed by similar increases by the ’Alawf, the 'Amfr of Dthdla and Al-Baishf (of Khoraiba), and led to such repeated complaints by traders and kafilas, that the Resident deemed it necessary to intervene. In November 1888 the Resident, accompanied by the First Assistant Resident, proceeded into the Haushabf district, where a meeting of all the chiefs concerned was effected, and on the 15th of that month each subscribed to a written schedule of rates (copies attached vide Appendix B) to be levied for the future in his district. In July the Haushabf visited the Resident at Aden, and was suitably entertained. The Haushabf in several instances exceeded the rates of , as . transit duty laid down in the agree- ment of 1888. He visited Aden and was given arms and ammunition to suppress the Jabbera, and to recover various goods which they had plundered. Various skirmishes took place with the Subehfs, but by ig9o gi&gt; the intercession of the 'Amfr of Dtfffila a permanent peace was made with the ’Abdalf. The First Assistant Resident visited the Haushabf country on his way to Dthdla. The Sultan visited Aden in Tanuarv 1891. The Haushabf country was surveyed by Captain Wahab. Some opposition was shown by the Dairf and Dthambarf tribes. The Sultan visited Aden and asked for a Protectorate Treaty. He was warned not to embroil himself with the Turks. 1892-93.THE HAUSHABT. 49 b 744—4 The Ahl Yehya declaring that they were oppressed by the 8 Haushabf sought the protection of the ’AbdalL The Resident while refusing to allow the latter to espouse their cause advised the Haushabf Sultan to come to terms with them. As the Haushabf Sultan was detaining kafilas and levying i894 95 unauthorised dues, the ’Abdalf entered the Haushabf country with an armed force. Mohsin bin ’Alf the Haushabf Sultan fled to Ta’izz and was repudiated by his tribesmen who elected the ’Abdalf as their ruler. Subsequently Mohsin bin ’Alf gave himself up to the ’Abdalf and accepted an asylum and a stipend. After further trouble a reconciliation was effected and the greater part of the Haushabf country was restored to its former ruler. An agreement (No. n) was signed by the Haushabf and ’Abdalf and witnessed by the Resident on 6th August 1895. On the same day the Resident concluded a Protectorate Treaty (No. 12) with the Haushabf Sultan. &gt;895 97 - Several robberies were committed by the Dthambarf. The Haushabf Sultan visited Aden and asked for arms 1897-98 • anc * ammun i t i° n to prevent the Subehf, Dairf and Dthambarf tribes from plundering on the caravan routes. The Resident visited labal Manif 1899-I 9 OO. • , t T 11/ J in the Haushabi country. The Sultan complained that Muhammad bin Nasir Mukbil, a Shaikh of the Homar tribe, who had been appointed a Mudir by the Turkish authorities, had built a fort at Ad Dareja within Haushabf limits, which was occupied bv a Turkish garrison. In February 1901 a declaration was conveyed to the Porte that unless Muhammad bin Nasir Mukbil immediately evacuated the fort, he would be expelled by the Aden Garrison. The Porte issued orders that Muhammad bin Nasir Mukbil should be expelled but as these orders were not carried out, the Haushabf chief was requested to expel him. He however failed in an attempt to do this and in July a force of 500 men was despatched from Aden. On the 26th July Muhammad bin Nasir Mukbil’s followers were attacked and driven from their position.5° ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. On the 2nd August the British force returned to Aden leaving a detachment at Musemir, which was however shortly afterwards withdrawn. In May 1902 the Sultan visited Aden. On his return the Haushabf began plundering kafilas and levying dues and a fight took place with the ’Abdalf. In June Captain Pottinger, Assistant Resident, was sent to the Haushabf country and succeeded in opening the road, and in effecting a reconciliation between the Haushabf and ’Abdalf. In December the Boundary Commission demarcated 19 o 3 . the Haushabf border. The Sultan who was in bad health did not succeed in stopping some of his tribesmen from plundering kafilas and his stipend was stopped to make good the amounts plundered. On the 28th September 1904 Sultan Mohsin bin ’Alf died. He was succeeded by Sultan ’Alf I9 ° 4 ' Mani’ whose relations with his kinsmen of Ar-Raha were strained. In June-July Captain Jacob the Political Officer was deputed to Nobat Dakim to enquire I90S ' into ’Abdalf-Haushabf relations qua the ’Abdalf-Haushabf agreement of 1895, to which Sultans Fadthl bin ’Alf of Lahej and Mohsin bin ’Alf of the Haushabfs were parties. The young Sultan ’Alf Mani’ thought the agreement derogatory to his position as a Sultdn having direct treaty relations with the British Government. After an enquiry of 3 weeks it was amicably arranged that the 1895 agreement should hold good. The 1899 agreement between these two chiefs was made null and void and the Haushabf was allowed, if he so wished, to enjoy the revenues of the 'Amfrf lands which, once Haushabf, had gone over to the ’Abdalf, as part of the indemnity for his losses in coercing the former Sultan Mohsin bin ’Alf. This settlement was up held by Government. ’Abdalf-Haushabf relations remained satisfactory through out the year, ’Alf Mani’ recognising the tutelage of the ’Abdalf Sultan. ’Alf Mani’ complained of loss of revenue on his borders by reason of the encroachments of certain Turkish border Arabs, notably the Wajihf.THE HAUSHABI'. 51 The Dthambarfs who are practically an independent clan of the Radfan range made constant raids in the Selat Billeh north of Nobat Dakim. The reason they gave for the aggression was the failure of Sultan ’Alf Mani’ to give them suitable presents. ’Alf Mani’s kinsmen of Ar-Raha were doubtless abettors for they, too, complained of Haushabf niggardliness. During the year the Political Officer at Dthdla visited the Turkish-Haushabf border and Mavia (Turkish) where he was hospitably entertained by the Turkish officials. Incited by Muhammad Nasir Mukbil of Ad Dareja fame (once incarcerat ed at San’a but released when the ’Imam was investing the place) the Arabs across the border were accused by the Haushabf Sultan of fraudulent appropriation of his revenues. The non-receipt of border maps precluded investigation, but the Haushabf was warned to keep the peace and informed that his claims would be presently sifted. igo6 The Political Agent, Dthdla, again visited Haushabf territory. In December the Dthambarfs attacked at nightfall a sick convoy of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers in the Selat Billeh, near Nobat Dakim. On their fire being returned the marauders decamped. One private and a camelman were slightly wounded. The Dthambarf Shaikhs professed regret at the carelessness of their people but were powerless to give reparation. Dissatisfied with the amount of presents given them at Lahej the Jabbera section of Subehfs fired into the midst of some ’Abdalf well-diggers at Nobat Dakim. The Nobat Dakim garrison returned the fire and after a brisk exchange of shots the Subehfs made off. An ’Abdalf-Hausbabf combination against these Subehfs was a mere fiasco, since the ’Abdalf support was purely nominal. ’Alf Mani’ captured some of the Jabbera ringleaders and imprisoned them at Musemir. The Haushabf Sultan’s contemptuous treatment of his folk at Ar-Raha was still very noticeable. His attention was repeatedly called to the insecurity of the trade routes travers ing his country and for a time he posted men at various places to check the Subehfs and Dthambarfs. The Sultan, however, denied his responsibility for misdeeds committed by others than his own tribesmen.5 2 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. A provision convoy proceeding from Dthala to Dthubiyat was plundered by Haushabfs of A 1 Lijma on the Wddf Tiban and the camels were lifted. The Sultan punished these people and returned the camels. His stipend was mulcted to secure the compensation due to the camel owners. In January various complaints were received of encroach ment on Haushabf soil, to exact I9 ° 7 ' revenues, by Shaikh Munassar Husein al-Wajihi and Shaikh Nagi of Daha. Ihe Political Agent, Dthdla, addressed the Turkish authorities at Ta’izz to curb the misdirected zeal of their subordinates. The Political Agent, Dthala, visited the Turkish border in April and traversed it with the Sultan to enquire into the truth of the Haushabf allegations. It appeared that ’AH Mani’ had exaggerated his case, but it transpired that certain revenues of the Sultan’s, to which he had a title in the Wadf Fakir, had not been collected by him. He was warned to steer clear of Turkish officials. He was also given a list of the villages over which he could claim overlordship and the border was carefully explained to him. He was further cautioned not to give refuge to the Shaikh of Daba, who, oppressed by overtaxation conducted by the Turkish nominee Shaikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, had come over to Haushabf territory, and declined to pay any revenues to his masters. Sultan ’Alf Mani’ appeared to take a much greater interest in his administration, thanks to the help given him by his father-in-law and chief adviser Sdleh-ba-Hashim the Haushabf Akil. His relations with his kinsfolk of Ar-Raha continued far from satisfactory. They complained of his niggardly dealings with them. In September Sultan ’Alf Mani’ reported that Shaikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil had asked for an interview. They met on the border and made an amicable settlement of the various blood-feuds that had for long past imperilled border relations. The Sultan when asked to come to Nobat Dakim to meet the Political Agent and sign a new agreement pleaded ill- health and then the occurrence of the Ramadthan. Still later he showed no inclination to appear for this purpose.The Aulaki'. The ’Aulakfs are divided into two sections, the Upper and Lower, each governed by an independent Sultdn. The Upper ’Aulakf are again sub-divided, part being under the rule of a Sultdn, who resides at Nusab, and part under a Shaikh, who is almost as powerful as the former and whose principal place of residence is at Yeshbum. The Lower ’Aulakf are under a Sultan, whose principal residence is at Ah war. The ’Aulakf territory extends along the coast between the Fadthlf and Dhuyaibf tribes ; but the port of ’Irka on this coast belongs to an independent Shaikh of the Badas family, of whom a separate account will be found elsewhere. The exact boundary between the Fadthlf and ’Aulakf on the coast is not ascertained, but is supposed to be between Makatfn-al-Kebfr and Makatfn-as-Saghfr. The Upper ’Aulakf Sultan’s territory is bounded on the west by the territory of the ’Audalf tribe, on the east by the country of an independent tribe called Khalifa, whilst on the south it is divided from the Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh’s territory by the district of Al-Musaina’a. No estimate can be given of its area. The Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh’s territory is bounded on the north by the Upper ’Aulakf Sultdn’s district of Al-Musaina’a, on the south by the Lower ’Aulakf district of Al-Manka’a, on the east by the independent tribe of Al-Kh&amp;n&amp;k, and on the west by the Fadthlf district of Jahhiyn. Its area may be estimated at i ,600 square miles. The Lower ’Aulakf territory is bounded on the north by the Upper ’Aulakf—a hill called Hajar-ar-Rayydn defining the limit, on the south by the Arabian Sea, on the east by the country of the Dhuyaibf, and on the west by the districts in habited by the Ji’danf and Markashf sub-tribes of the Fadthlf. The Lower ’Aulakf territory cannot be estimated at less than 1,800 square miles. The principal towns and villages in the Upper ’Aulakf Sultan’s territory are Nusdb, with an estimated population of 4,000, situated in an immense plain ; mines of salt are found here ; Al-Mishkafa ; Am-Salab, with an estimated population of5 + ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. i ,000 ; An-Nakub ; Solub ; Al-Jawl; Ar-Rukba ; Hamm&amp;n ; Khumdrf; Musaina’a ; Ta’an ; Mukbala ; As-Shirj ; and Da- thfna. In all there are supposed to be one hundred villages. In the Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh’s territory there are no towns; and the inhabitants are chiefly nomads, who move about pastur ing their cattle. The following are some of the villages :—As- Sa’aid, Kawla, Yeshbum, Al-’Atf, Udat-Shams, As-Sufdl. In the Lower ’Aulakf territory the principal places are Al- Manka’a, Hamara, Hauta, Al-Mahfid, Al-Haik, As-Shukaib, Al-Kabs, Al-Jawl, Al-Husn, Hanad, and Ahwar, the capital, called a port, though distant some miles from the sea.

The custom of trial by ordeal (bashaa) is still in use in this and neighbouring tribes but not much resorted to, except for serious crimes. There are numerous methods, but the usual one is the application of a heated knife to the tongue. It is impossible to give any accurate estimate of the reve- Revenues. nues but the Upper ’Aulakf Sultln’s has been estimated at Rs. 16,000, the Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh’s at Rs. 6,000, and the Lower ’Aulakf’s at Rs. 10,000.

Should a man commit murder, the murderer is fined, and after the expiration of a certain period the deceased’s heirs are permitted to take revenge. During the period fixed, a truce prevails. Should the deceased person’s heirs kill the murderer during the period of truce, the Sultdn punishes the offender. Amputation of the hands for theft is not a punishment existing in this tribe. In disposing of crime and civil matters the Sultan acts on the advice of the Shaikhs, Sayyfds or Shenfs, in the manner described under the head of the “ Wdhidf” tribe.

They assert themselves to be descendants of the ancient Himyarites and inhabit the valleys bordering on the Dhuyaibfs, with whom they claim kinship: their head-quarters are at Al-Khabr.

Upper ’Aulaki'. Little is known of the Upper ’Aulakf country or their people, although their chiefs have frequently visited Aden. The correspondence with the Upper ’Aulakf reveals num erous complaints against the “ people of Yemen ” {i.e., the ’Abdalfs and Fadthlfs) in connection with ancient “ customary rights.” Both the Sultan and Shaikh have frequently evinced a disposition to proceed to blows with the ’Abdalfs and Fadthlfs, but have been kept in check by the Resident’s remonstrances and warnings. These “ customary rights ” appear to have been settled or commuted long ago, or to have lapsed. So long as the ’Aulakfs had the power, they were able to extort a species of stipend from their weaker neighbours ; but with the growth of the ’Abdalf and Fadthlf power they have had to be content with such gifts as the latter gave them. Whenever the gifts fall below their expectations the ’Aulakfs bring up the old claims of “ customary rights.” In 1882, in pursuance of their policy of irritating their neighbours, the Sultan expressed an intention of building a fort at Kurrum Murshed, near Dathfna, on the confines of Fadthlf territory, but was restrained by the remonstrances of the Resident. During the protracted struggle between the neighbouring States of Shehr and Mokalla the ’Aulakfs threw in their lotTHE ’AULAKl'. 57 with the Nakfb of Mokalla, and often lent a force of men to assist him. On the murder of the Fadthlf Sultan Haidara, the Sultan and Shaikh both showed a desire to assist the murderer Husain against the young FadthH chief, but were prevented from action by the warnings of the Resident. The Sultan claimed (in 1878) a ^rd share in the port of Makdtfn (in Lower ’Aulaki territory), and declared that the Lower ’Aulakf possessed only a |th share therein. In 1884 the Sultdn claimed |rds of Makatfn, whereas the Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh stated that §rds belonged to the Lower ’Aulakf. In September 1879 Sultdn ’Awadth bin ’Abdalla was de throned in consequence of old age and his inability to restrain the excesses of his younger sons. His eldest son ’Abdalla was elected Sultdn chiefly through the influence of the Upper ’Aulaki Shaikh Farfd bin Ndsir. In 1883 when the Lower ’Aulakf attacked the Fadthlf, overtures were made to the Upper ’Aulakf for assistance, but the Resident was able to dissuade them from assisting the Lower ’Aulakf. In the commencement of 1884 there were disturbances between the Upper ’Aulakfs and the Ahl-Khalffa, an independ ent neighbouring tribe, in the course of which the Sultdn’s eldest brother was killed. The Ahl-Khalffa continued to give trouble to the Upper 1885 and 1886. ’Aulakf in 1885 and the old “ customary rights ” as against the “ people of Yemen ” formed the subject of several letters from the Sultdn in 1886. Sult&amp;n ’Abdalla b in ’Awadth died on the 1 ith Decem- l8S , ber, and was succeeded by his son 7 ’ Saleh. During 1888 the Upper ’Aulakf Sultdn and Shaikh made l888 a combined attack on Dathfna. This province is almost independent, its Shaikh having for many years evaded payment of the tribute of 5 dollars per “ dhimd ” of cultivated land due to the Sultdn. The Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh Farfd bin Ndsir died on 2nd June 1888, and was succeeded by his eldest son Ruwais. The Upper ’Aulakf Sultdn and Shaikh in conjunction with the Lower ’Aulakf Sultdn threatened to invade the ’Abdalf country but on the Resident informing them that they would58 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. be driven back by force they abandoned the attempt. The Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh Ruwais bin Farid visited Aden and voluntarily gave a written agreement to abandon his alleg ed customary rights over Yemen the ’Abdalf and Fadthlf country). The Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh Am-Rasas bin Farid visited n Aden for the first time since his acces- iSgo-Qi. • , . • , sion and was given a special present. The Upper ’Aulakl Sultdn Sdleh bin ’Abdalla having with- 1893 94 drawn certain expressions, which he had used in a letter tending to revive the question of “ customary rights over Yemen ”, was allowed to send in recommendatory letters again. Owing to a dispute about some land near Marir the Upper 'Aulakis were excluded from the Lower ’Aulakf country. The Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh assisted Mohsin bin ’Alf the 1894 95. Wahidf against his tribesmen. ig97 The Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh visited Aden and was entertained. There was a famine in the Upper ’Aulakf country. The Sultan was granted some aid by the Resi dent. 1898-99. In July 1902 Shaikh Am-Rasas bin Farid died and was succeeded by Shaikh Mohsin bin Farfd. On 8th December 1903 a treaty (No. 39) was concluded at Aden with the Upper ’Aulakf. It was ratified on 23rd April 1904. Government sanctioned a present of 6 M. H. rifles to the } o6 Upper ’Aulakf Sultan and 5 rifles to the Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh, with in each case 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Both chiefs were given special monetary assistance on account of scarcity in the ’Aulakf country in 1905. The present of 6 M. H. rifles with 1,000 rounds of ammunition sanctioned by Government was sent to the Upper ’Aulakf Sultan in March.THE ’AULAKl'. 59 Shaikh Mohsin bin Farfd manifested a disposition to interfere in Wahidi affairs, but, failing to receive any encourage* ment from the Residency, apparently desisted. He also endeavoured to induce Government to give him monetary assistance towards improving the Talh road from Dathfna : it was pointed out to him that he was the person who stood to profit by the undertaking, and he was advised to carry it out himself. There was a large influx of Upper ’Aulakf visitors between July and September, the most important of whom was Shaikh Ruwais brother of Shaikh Mohsin bin Farid. There was some desultory fighting between both the Sultan and Shaikh of the Upper ’Aulakis and some of the Dathfna tribes. Lower ’Aulaki'. In October 1855 a treaty (No. LXI) was made with Sultdn Munassar bin Bubakr Mahdf of the Lower ’Aulakf, whereby he bound himself to prohibit the importation of slaves into his country from Africa. The Sultan, as well as his son ’Abdalla, was murdered in July 1863, and was succeeded by his cousin Bubakr bin ’Abdalla. The latter always exhibited a friendly spirit towards the British Government, but, owing to the slender means which he possessed of enforcing his authority over his tribe, he was not always able to prevent vessels wrecked on his shores from being plundered. An instance occurred in the case of the American barque “ Harvester,” which, on being abandoned by the captain and crew, was burnt and plundered in 1870. There was, however, nothing to show that the Sultdn was implicated in the matter, but every reason to believe that it took place in direct opposition to his wishes. On visiting Aden some months later, he bound himself by an engagement to use his best endeavours to prevent outrages in future, and to protect and convey, if possible, to Aden any shipwrecked seamen who might need his assistance. This engagement was ratified on nth December 1871, and a copy is attached (Appendix B). Up to the present date there has been constant com munication between the Lower ’Aulakf and Aden Residency, and the Sultan or his sons have frequently visited Aden.6o ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The correspondence with this chief has been chiefly on the subject of his quarrels and disagreements with the Fadthlfs. The ’Aulakf has constantly evinced a disposition to attack the Fadthlf, or make a raid into Fadthli territory, and he has been as constantly checked by remonstrances from the Resident. During the critical state of affairs in the Fadthlf district consequent on the murder of Sultan Haidara, the Lower ’Aulakf went so far as to assist the young Fadthlf chief Ahmed bin Husain with a force of men against his father, the outlawed Husain. In 1882 the Lower ’Aulakf expressed a desire that the port of Makdtfn should be placed under British protection, and also complained of Soon' fishermen fishing off the port without payment of dues. The matter was referred to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and it appeared that the subjects of His Highness the Sultdn of Muscat claimed a right on the grounds of immemorial custom and usage to fish in the port. The subject then dropped. In the beginning of 1883 dissensions broke out between the Fadthlfs and the Lower ’Aulakfs, leading to a raid by the latter on Fadthlf territory in spite of the remonstrances of the Resident. The Lower ’Aulakfs were defeated with considerable loss, as already detailed in the account of the Fadthlf tribe. In June 1883 the Lower ’Aulakf resumed a more con ciliatory attitude and visited Aden in December, when he was honourably treated. The quarrel with the Fadthlfs was patch ed up by truces renewed from time to time. Sultdn Bubakr bin ’Abdalla visited Aden in March 1885 1885 and 1886. and the . opportunity was taken to obtain a promise to extend the truce with the Fadthlf. During the monsoon of 1885 the S. S. 'Tuna” was wrecked on the shores of the Lower ’Aulakf and the Sultan duly protected the wreck, which was eventually abandoned and the Sult&amp;n was allowed to dispose of it. The Sultan visited Aden in March 1886. He rebuilt a fort at Makdtfn this year. The Sultdn visited Aden in August, and expressed a 1887 desire for closer relations with the British Government. The Sultan visited Aden in May. He was granted an 1888 annual stipend of 360 dollars (G. R. No. 4461, Political Department, dated 30th June 1888).THE ’AULAKl'. 6l The Lower ’Aulakf Shaikh in conjunction with the Upper ’Aulakf Sultan and Shaikh threatened to invade the ’Abdalf country but on the Resident informing them that they would be driven back by force they abandoned the attempt. A Protectorate Treaty (No. 19) was signed by the Sultan on 2nd June 1888. The Sultdn visited Aden at the same time as the Fadthlf Sultdn and they discussed the dispute, which had long been outstanding between them, with the Resident. As the latter could effect no settlement without interfering unduly in inter tribal affairs, the dispute remained unsettled. The Sultdn at the same time voluntarily signed an agree ment abandoning his old customary rights over Yemen. Some of his retainers who had not been entertained at Aden stabbed some camels at Shaikh ’Othman. The Sultdn’s stipend was stopped till he had compensated the owners. The Lower ’Aulakf Sultdn visited Aden and was given 1890-91. some pecuniary aid to restore the damage done by rain. The Protectorate Treaty was given him duly ratified. The Lower ’Aulakf Sultan visited Aden. He returned a i89i . 92&gt; sketch of flags which had been sent him because no present was given him. Sultdn Bubakr bin ’Abdalla abdicated. He was i892 . 93 succeeded by Saleh bin ’Alf Nasir, to whom the usual annual stipend was continued. Owing to a dispute over some land near Marir the Upper ’Aulakf were excluded from the 93 ' 94, Lower ’Aulakf country. The Sultdn complained to the Resident about Soon fishermen fishing in his territorial waters. The Lower ’Aulakf Sultan visited Aden and asked for 1894 95 assistance, as his tribesmen were unruly and there was a famine in his country. In April 1896 Bubakr bin ’Abdalla the ex-Sultan died. The Lower ’Aulakf Sultan visited Aden and was enter- ^ tained. He paid for some camels which his tribesmen had maimedARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The famine in the Lower ’Aulakf country continued and „ when the Sultan visited Aden he was given 1898-99. . , some assistance. The Lower ’Aulakf Sultan paid a visit to Aden and was entertained. Sultan Sdleh bin ’Alf Ndsir was dethroned and succeeded „ by Sultdn ’Alf bin Munassir. 1QOO. J A quarrel arose with the Upper ’Aulakf and several skirmishes took place. On 5th December Sultdn ’Alf bin Munassir died. He was succeeded by Sultan Ndsir bin Bubakr. The Fadthlf fired on a Lower ’Aulakf Sambuk and in consequence the old feud between the two tribes broke out again. Later a truce was proclaimed for two months. The Sultan’s son Mahomed paid a visit to Aden and presented a horse to the Resident. In June a number of horses the property of Government and of private individuals were mutilated at Shaikh ’Othman and Khor Maksar. 1906. The outrage proved to have been committed by two men of the Ahl Saad, an important clan of the Lower ’Aulakf. The Sultdn was accordingly called upon to surrender them. He pleaded his inability to do so owing to the fact that the Ahl Saad were in rebellion against him. Compensation was paid to the owners of the animals that had suffered, and Govern ment approved of the Resident’s suggestion that, failing the surrender of the offenders, the amount should be deducted from the Sultan’s stipend. Action was taken accordingly. Sultdn Mehdf bin Nasir, son of the Lower ’Aulakf Sultdn, visited Aden in August. He brought a letter from his father expressing submission to the decision that his stipend should be suspended in order to pay compensation for the mutilations committed by the two ruffians of the Ahl Saad mentioned above.The Yafai. The Yafaf are divided into the Yafai'-as-Sufla and the Yafai-al-Ulya or Lower and Upper. Upper Yafai'. The Upper Yafai tribe is estimated to exceed in number 15,000 fighting men. This tribe borders upon the province of Hadthramut and is often engaged in hostilities with the Kaitf tribe. The connection between the Yafaf and Kaitf tribes will be found in the description of Shehr, Mokalla and the Kathfrf tribe. The Yafaf country formerly extended from a point on the sea-coast to the eastward of Aden as far as the frontiers of Hadthramut. The maritime districts, including Ja’wala and Al-Asala, were, however, wrested from the Yafaf shortly before the British occupation of Aden (in 1839), and the Yafaf has been unable to regain possession from the Fadthlf. The Upper Yafaf country is fertile, producing coffee, waras (bastard saffron), cotton, wheat, barley and wax in large quantities ; but little trade from this district reaches Aden. The Upper Yafaf is quite distinct from the Lower Yafaf: neither pays the other any tribute, but each is independ ent. It is related that about a hundred years ago Saif, the third Sultan of the Lower Yafaf, had in his employ a clerk named Shaikh Harharah, who was much beloved by the Sultan, and an able man. To him the Sultan granted bv deed of gift a district called “ As-Sufal,” and from this originated the Upper Yafaf. The reigning family of the latter are related to the ’Abdalf reigning family, and there is con siderable intercourse between them. The Aden Residency has little communication with the Upper Yafaf tribe, and it was only during the hostilities between Shehr and Mokalla that the tribe came into notice permission having been given in 1881 to the Kaitf to obtain a body of mercenaries from the Upper Yafaf, whose Sultan Mahomed bin ’Alf bin Saleh visited Aden and was honourably entertained. The Sultdn again visited Aden in March 1887. Near the Barrier Gate he sustained a fall from his camel, which necessitated his stay in Aden under medical treatment for six weeks.64 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. Sultan Mahomed bin ’AH visited 1886-89. Aden and was entertained. The Sultdn again visited Aden. 1892. Several of the Upper Yafaf Shaikhs visited San’a and acknowledged Turkish authority. 1894-95. In May 1895 Turks at Juban and Ar-Rubiaten sent for Shaikh Mahomed ’AH and Shaikh Kahtan to accompany them into the 1895*96. Yafaf country. 1895-96. Sultan Mahomed bin ’All died on the 28th April 1895. When it was proposed to demarcate our frontier to the north-east of Dthdla, treaties (Nos. 29, 30 and 31) were concluded with the Dthubf and Mausatta sections in May and July respectively, their chiefs being granted monthly stipends of 40 dollars and 50 dollars. Later in the year treaties (Nos. 32, 33, 34 and 35) were also concluded with the Muflahf, Shaibf and Hadthramf sections and with Sultan Kahtan who was then regarded as the titular chief of the whole tribe. On the 31 st of August a survey party with an escort left Dthdla for the Shaibf country. They completed their survey and then entered the Rubiaten district, leaving a post at Awabil. Reports were received that Sdleh bin Omar, Sultdn Kahtan’s brother, was collecting a force to attack the surveyors. This force accompanied by several of the younger members of the Mausatta Shaikh’s family, attacked the post at Awabil on the 13th September but were rupulsed. The Mausatta Shaikhs apologised for the presence of any members of their family stating that they were unable to control them. Owing to the protests of the Turks who declared that any advance into the Rada district would imperil negotiations between the two Governments, all idea of survey ing the north-east boundary was abandoned. However the boundary line in Shaibf country was demar cated and on 14th October the Commissioners returned to Dthala. A conflict was carried on between Sdleh bin Omar and Sultdn Kahtan the former having usurped the Sultan’s power when the latter visited Aden to sign a treaty. The Shaikhs of Juban visited Aden during 1904.THE YAFAT. 65 B 744-S In October 1903 an agreement (No. 34) was concluded with Shaikh Mutahir ’Alt of the Shaibi tribe, by which he undertook to protect the boundary pillars for a monthly stipend of 7 dollars. In July of the same year a written undertaking (No. 31), which was eventually confirmed by Government in 1905, was given by the Political Resident, Aden, to Shaikh ’Ah' Mohsin Askar of the Mausatta clan, who was of considerable service to the Aden Boundary Commission, that he would be paid a personal allowance of 20 dollars a month for so long as his behaviour and that of the Mausatta clan continued to be satis factory. f In December a sum of 1,500 dollars was paid to Shaikh ’Ah' Mohsin Askar who en£ap;ed to bring 1904. • • . O O about the rehabilitation of Sultan Kahtan of the Dthubf section. The second moiety of 1,500 dollars was promised when the Sultdn had regained his authority. Funds were required to pay the blood-monies incurred by Kahtan in his fight with his brother Sdleh. Shaikh ’Alf Mohsin engaged to effect the restoration in two months’ time, but this he did not succeed in doing. The Political Agent, Dthdla, was many times visited by the Yafaf Shaikhs with the exception of the Hadthramf, and of course Kahtan was unable to leave his country. The Yafafs have considerable commerce with India, Java and Sumatra. Sultdn Kahtan w r as the whole year striving ineffectually x 9 o6. to regain his authority. In January Shaikh ’Alt Mohsin, piqued because of alleged want of respect, returned to the Shaib country where the House of Mausatta (of which the Askar family are stipendi aries of ours) have certain pecuniary interests. Here he dis mantled a boundary pillar in charge of Shaikh Mutahir ’Alf and wrote detailing his action. He was temporarily deprived of his allowance. In May this Shaikh came in and sued for pardon. Govern ment were pleased to recontinue his allowance from the date of his apology. The Shaib country was in a disturbed state throughout the year. Our stipendiary there one ’Alf Mdni’ being only one of many Shaikhs w r as a constant object for their jealousy. He sought our aid against his tribesmen, but was told he must66 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. manage his own affairs. He was advised to propitiate his tribesmen who accused him of niggardliness. Many of the leading Shaikhs visited the Political Agent in Dthdla but were referred to 'Ah' Mini’ and told to bring recommendatory letters from him before presents could be made. During the year a band of men from the House of Mausatta went to Juban (Turkish) to settle affairs between Juban and Na’wa (which claims Mausatta tutelage). The Askar stipendiaries were warned not to become implicated in Juban affairs and they promised compliance, but explained that there was from time immemorial a close commerce between Yafaf, Juban and Na’wa. Some Shaikhs and soldiers actually went to Juban and affairs were eventually settled. Sultans Haidara and Kahtan entered into a bond to effect the latter’s restoration to power as Sultdn of the Dthubf faction. Their co-operation was conditioned by assistance expected from the Residency in arms and money. They were told that they must work out their own salvation ; and that Government’s assistance was limited to the 3,000 dollars promised to Kahtan to effect his rehabilitation. In March Shaikh Mutahir ’Ah' of Sahm-al-Ardaf was granted the special rate of a Rs. 2 igo*]. # 1 u # dollar for his remuneration in keeping in repair the pillars in his country. The Shaikh was asked to re-erect the 3 pillars in his charge, of which one had been dismantled in 1906 by Shaikh ’Ah' Mohsin Askar of Mausatta. He reported the work had been completed. Sult&amp;n Kahtan bin Umar did not return to his house at Mahjaba but remained domiciled with the Yazidf clan of Lower Yafai' who interested themselves in his restoration. The House of Mausatta patched up the Juban-Na’wa differences, and Juban declared itself part and parcel of Yafaf, while Na’wa expressed doubts as to the sphere of influence within which it fell—whether British or Turkish. Both Juban and Na’wa expressed fear of Turkish influence and ultimate absorption into the Turkish administration. Juban was told that it was comprised within the Turkish sphere and Yafaf was warned not to do anything to complicate our relations with our friends the Turks.THE YAFAI'. 67 In September Sultan Kahtan bin Umar continued unrestored to power though he was given in full the 3,000 dollars promised to him by Government. The Shaikhs of Dthubf and Muflahf made several visits to the Political Agent in Dthala, and upon our departure from Dthala the Yafaf Shaikhs generally appeared more friendly with us—doubtless owing to our withdrawal and the reduction to a minimum of our intervention in Yafaf affairs. Lower Yafai'. The Lower Yafaf country is bounded on the north by the Upper Yafaf, on the south and east by the Fadthlf and independent tribes, and on the west by the territories of the Amfr of Dthala and of the Haushabf. The country is well watered, but has been slightly visited, so that little is known of it. It is said to be very mountainous, abounding in fertile valleys which produce grapes, jowari, coffee and madder in abundance. Horses, camels, donkeys, sheep and goats are said to be numerous. In winter the cold is sufficient to freeze the streams. The area cannot be estimated, but the popula tion cannot be under 20,000 souls. The principal towns and villages are—Khanfar, on the left bank of the Bana-al-Kara, the capital, situated on a hill which commands the country for miles around. The Sultdn resides here most of the year. The surrounding country is thoroughly watered by the Band. Ar-Rawwa; Al-Husn, situated in a large grassy plain bearing the appearance of being periodically flooded and under cultivation for the most part; Nakhib; Hummd ; Amshak ; Bu-Sab’a ; Al-Khabt; Al-Masna’a ; Sarar. Al-Khabt and Al-Masna’a claim to be independent. The rivers Band and Hasan, referred to under the head of the Fadthlf tribe, take their rise in the Yafaf country. The Band runs continuously for six months (May to October), and freshets occur frequently, which reach the sea. The Hasan, though a broader river, is never unfordable, and its waters do not reach the sea more than a dozen times a year. The Ndzi’a, which has been the fruitful source of disputes between the Fadthlf and Yafaf, flows-in a natural channel from the Band near Al-Masna’a a little below al-Hasn : artificial cuts from the Ndzi’a water the Fadthlf cultivated lands between the Band and the Hasan.68 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The complexion of the tribe is rather fair. There is a small admixture of Jews, who are the peop e. chiefly shop-keepers and goldsmiths. The revenues are estimated at about 8,000 dollars (but „ there is no trustworthy information on Revenues. , • \ i • , r the point), derived Irom imposts on kdfllas and taxes, especially upon coffee. The Sultan administers both criminal and civil justice, the Kadthfs only performing marriage Administration. . rry/ r ceremonies, there are lour Kadthis —two at Al-Kdra, one at Sarar and one at Al-Husn. If a tribesman murder a fellow-subject, the Sultdn compels the murdered person’s heirs to accept &lt;r diya” of 700 dollars, and the murderer is imprisoned ; but should the deceased’s heirs be sufficiently powerful, they may kill the murderer without accepting the blood-money after a certain period. Amputation of the hands is not inflicted for thefts. Like many other tribes in the south of Arabia the Yafaf were formerly subject to the ’Imams of Rugmng family.

Soon after the Historical Resum;. capture of Aden, two engagements (No. LXV) were entered into with Sultan ’All bin Ghalib, the LowerTHE YAFAI'. 69 Yafaf. Though several attempts were made to induce the Yafaf to enter into a coalition against Aden, none were suc cessful, and the engagement was loyally adhered to. Sultan ’Alf bin Ghalib died on 14th December 1841 at the age, it is said, of 115 years. He was succeeded by his son Ahmed bin ’Alf, also of great age. This Sultan lived much in retirement at the hill-resort of Al-Kara, leaving the task of government to his son ’Alf bin Ahmed, whose head-quarters were at Khanfar. Ahmed bin ’Alf died on 28th September 1873, anc ^ was succeeded by his son ’Alf bin Ahmed. During the life-time of, and against the wishes of his father, 'Alf had agreed in presence of the Resident, General Tremenheere, to accept a royalty from the Fadthlf Sultdn for the use of the waters of the Nazi’a. The agreement was not acted up to, and in 1873 the Yafaf’s stipend was stopped. One of the first acts of ’Alf bin Ahmed on becoming Sultan was to make a truce of one year with the Fadthlf, and it was hoped the question of the Nazi’a would soon be decided. But the dispute continued, and led on one occasion to con siderable bloodshed on both sides. The Yafaf on various pretexts evaded the agreement, and the ill-feeling was aggra vated in the beginning of 1876 by the aid given by the Yafaf to the chief of Dirjdj against the Fadthlf. At length, on the 21 st July 1876, an agreement was come to before the Resident, and, in December of the same year, Sultan ’Alf bin Ahmed paid a visit to the Resident. The Nazi’a question was temporarily settled, and payment of the Yafaf’s stipend was resumed with all arrears. The chief of Dirjaj soon after wards submitted to the Fadthlf, and the relations between the Fadthlf and Yafaf improved considerably. In 1878, when the outlawed Husain was committing depredations in Fadthlf territory, numerous complaints were made by the Yafaf. The Resident continued to give friendly counsels, and deprecated any retaliation for acts which were not countenanced by the young Fadthlf chief, but committed by partisans of the murderer Husain. In May 1879 the ill-feeling was increased by the murder of a Yafaf Sultan, named ’Abdalla bin Ahmed bin ’Abdul Karfm, by a turbulent sub-tribe of the Fadthlf. The Yafaf cut off the supply of the Nazi’a, and the Resident threatened to stop the Yafaf’s stipend. This threat was not carried out, but all pre-ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. sents to the Yafaf were discontinued. A truce was forced on the Yafaf, and an inquiry, conducted by the Mansabs of the two tribes, eventually led to an adjustment of all matters in dispute. In 1882 it was intended to send a part of the Aden Troop into the Lower Yafaf country, the Sultan being favourable to such visit; but, meanwhile, a change of Residents took place and the contemplated visit was not paid. In 1883, when the Lower ’Aulakf attacked the Fadthlf, the Lower Yafaf, following the advice of the Resident, main tained an attitude of neutrality. Sultan ’Alf bin Ahmed visited Aden in April 1885. He died on the 26th May 1885 and was succeeded by his brother Mohsin bin Ahmed, to whom the stipend enjoyed by his pre decessors was continued by Government Resolution No. 7009, Political Department, dated *29th November 1886. Sultan Ahmed bin ’Alf, son of the deceased Sultan, twice visited Aden in 1886 on behalf of the reigning Sultan. iS87 Sultan Mohsin bin Ahmed visited Aden in May and again in October. Nasir bin ’Alf Ghalib, the Sultan’s uncle, died in April l888 1888. Sultan Mohsin visited Aden in August. In consequence of territorial disputes with the Fadthlf and the building by the latter of a fort at Bfr Majhar, the Yafaf again cut off the supply of the Nazi’a. Towards the end of the year the Yafaf attacked the fort at Bfr Majhar but were repulsed. The Resident arranged a truce between the Yafaf and Fadthlf but it was not kept. Hostilities with the Fadthlf continued. When the Sultdn 1889- 90. visited Aden, the matter was discussed but no settlement was reached. The feud continued throughout the next year, interrupted by occasional short truces. J In July 1892 Sultdn Mohsin bin ’Alf died and was 1890- 92. succeeded by his nephew Sultdn Ahmed bin ’Alf. Part of the Lower Yafaf country was surveyed by Captain Wahab. rTHE YAFAI'. Sultdn Ahmed bin ’AH paid a visit to Aden and discussed the dispute between him and the ,892 - 93 ' Fadthlf. Sultdn Ahmed bin ’AH passed through Aden on his way to Mecca where he died on 27th June 1893 94 i 893- He was succeeded by Sultan Bubakr bin Saif whose accession was recognised by Govern ment. An extension of Captain Wahab’s survey was made by Mr. G. P. Tate. A year’s truce was proclaimed with the Fadthlf, and the fortlet of Bfr Majhar was closed. The Turks tried to induce the Sultdn to accept Turkish suzerainty. The Sultdn was advised to have no dealings with them and the Governor General of Yemen was informed that the Lower Yafaf were under British protection. Sult&amp;n Bubakr bin Saif visited Aden and on the 16th July i8ck signed a Protectorate Treaty ■ 895 - 96 . | N() Sultan Bubakr bin Saif visited Aden and apologised for his behaviour to Mr. Theodore Bent when he visited the Yafaf country. There was a famine in the Yafaf country. On 4th January 1899 Sultdn Bubakr bin Saif died. He was succeeded by Sultdn ’Abdalla bin Mohsin. Suit in ’Abdalla bin Mohsin visited Aden for the first time since his accession and was given a special present. He, however, took offence at the nature of his reception which he did not consider suitable to his position, and ceased all communications with the Aden Residency. The Fadthlf Sultan began levying dues on Yafaf kdfilas passing through his country and estab lished a new customs post at Zanjibar. The Yafaf retaliated by cutting off the water-supply from the Ndzi’a channel. The Fadthlf then attacked Al-Hasn and Al-Rawwd. In November 1903 the Resident ordered Colonel Abud to go to El Khamila to try and effect a reconciliation between the two tribes, but ’Abdalla bin Mohsin refused to attend the conference. In January the Fadthlfs attacked Raha. 1897-98. 1898-99. 1899-1900.HHHHBHEHBBB 72 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The Resident tried to put an end to these reprisals when the Fadthli Sult&amp;n visited Aden in 1904, but during his visit news arrived that the Fadthh's had occupied Khanfar. As they refused to abandon this place, no settlement was reached. Camels of the Kaladi and Yahari sections were employed in Government service in the camps at Dthala, in order to get into touch with this tribe whose ancestors first peopled what is now called Upper Yafaf. Maudtha bin Sef cousin of Sultdn ’Abdalla bin Mohsin visited the Political Officer at Dthala. Yafafs from Al-Kara then said that the Sultdn was of a peculiar temperament, and some of them said they were willing to depose him, as by his aloofness and refusal to visit Aden they were themselves losers. Maudtha bin Sef again visited the Political Agent at Dthala being deputed by the ’Abdalf Sultdn to settle the differences between the 'Amir of Dthala and the Shairf tribesmen.The Alawi. The territory occupied by the ’Alawi is bounded on the north by that occupied by the 'Amir of Dthala, on the west and south by the Haush- abi country, and on the east by the hills of the Dthanbarf, an independent tribe. The area of the tract held by the ’Alawi is small, probably not exceeding 40 square miles in extent. A small stream waters the district, rain falls on the hills to the north and east, the water of which is used for irrigation purposes. White and red jowari as well as bajri are grown. Live stock is also reared to a small extent. About 1,000 acres are under cultivation. The climate is moist and unhealthy. The population cannot exceed 1,500 souls. The principal villages are:— People Al-Kash’aa, with 500 Al-Khariba ,, 100 As-Sauda „ 200 Al-Hauta or Adh-Dhanib ,, 100 Jiml „ 50 A 1 Hajar ,, ' 100 The remainder of the population are scattered about in hamlets. The people are made up of subjects and tribesmen in about equal proportions. The fighting strength of the tribe is about 500. Many of the ’Alawf are employed in cultivation and rearing cattle, sheep and goats ; others hire out their camels. The ’Alawf have slight peculiarities of dialect which enable them to be identified. The annual revenue of the ’Alawf is estimated at 2,500 „ dollars. . It is derived from the follow- Revenue. ing sources.

Wilful murder by a tribesman of a subject is punishable by fine, and the deceased’s heirs are at liberty to slay the murderer if within a certain period blood money to the value of 770 dollars is not paid. A somewhat similar, but less rigorous, punishment takes place in case of death by misadventure; and if forty relatives or acquaintances of the accused swear to his previous good behaviour, and that the death is caused by negligence only and not with any malicious intent, the deceased’s relatives are compelled by the Shaikh to accept blood-money in lieu of all claims. If a subject kills a tribesman, the deceased’s relatives may slay the murderer, and a fine is also imposed. Should death have occurred through misadventure, the tribesman’s rights are the same as in wilful murder.

No separate engagement was entered into with the ’Alawf after the capture of Aden ; but the chief’s stipend was secured under the authority of Government Resolution, Political Department, No. 814, dated 14th May 1875. In 1873 a body of Turkish troops marched through the ’Alawf country, and compelled the chief Shaikh Saif bin Saif, who had refused to tender allegiance to the Turkish authorities at Ta’izz, to give in his submission and to surrender his son as a hostage. The latter was eventually released in consequence of the remonstrance of Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople.m ■ THE ’ALAWl' 75 Shaikh Saif bin Saif died in March 1875, and was succeeded by his nephew Said bin S&amp;leh. The annual stipend of 60 dollars was continued to him. In January 1885 the ’Alawf Shaikh, accompanied by his son, visited Aden. Good rain fell in 5 1885 in the ’Alawf district after 2 years’ scarcity. When the Resident proceeded to Dthala at the close of 1885 the Shaikh escorted him while in his district. In February 1886 the Shaikh visited Aden. During 1886 it was necessary for the Resident to write to the ’Alawf to desist from levying an intended fresh tax on kafilas. The ’Alawf Shaikh visited Aden in March and again in October, and nothing occurred during the year to disturb friendly relations. The levy of enhanced dues by the Haushabf at the close of 1886 was imitated by the ’Alawf and other chiefs, and led to such repeated complaints by traders and kafilas that the Resident deemed it necessary to intervene. At a meeting with the Resident at Al- Majbah in Haushabf limits the ’Alawf (and other chiefs concerned) subscribed to a written schedule, dated 15th Novem ber 1888, of rates to be levied in future in his district. The Shaikh visited Aden twice and asked for aid in arms and ammunition to suppress the Kotaibfs who had broken the agreement of 1888. The ’Alawf country was surveyed by Captain Wahab. As the chief did not render any assistance he was not given a present. The Shaikh visited Aden and asked for assistance in arms and ammunition to suppress the Kotaibf. 1887. 1888. 1889-90. 1891-93. 1893-94. Shaikh Saif bin Said visited Aden on several occasions. On the 16th July 1895 he signed a l895 ' 97 ‘ Protectorate Treaty. He complained of Turkish intrigues and the Kotaibf. He asked for permission to build a fort at Al-Olub to keep the latter in check. In March 1898 Shaikh Saif bin Said paid a visit to Aden. On his way back he was detained by 1897-98. t | ie &gt;Abdalf Sultan on the ground that he was insane. His relations elected his uncle Shaikh Husain76 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. bin Saleh as their chief. Subsequently he was handed over to the British Government. He was eventually allowed to return to his own country, but he made no effort to regain the chieftainship. Shaikh Husain bin Saleh died and was succeeded by Shaikh ig98 99 ’Ah' Nasir Saif, to whom the annual stipend was continued. The Resident visited Jimil in the ’Alawf country and Shaikh 'Alf Nasir Saif visited Aden and was entertained. In January of this year the ’Alawf Shaikh was given some I903 pecuniary assistance for building a tower at Al-Hamra which he under took to garrison with 30 men to protect the trade routes especially ^ against Kotaibf aggression. In April 1904 the Shaikh visited Aden. ’Alf Nasir was most useful as a provider of kirbi, etc., for I9C4&lt; the Native Infantry camels at our Suleik fort. Taking advantage of the eclipse of Kotaibf power on the Habilen, by reason of their defeat at our hands, ’Alf Nasir made full use of his opportun ities and began to lay claim to various places to which he was absolutely unentitled. Because of his customs at Mabaja opposite to Jimil and the erection of the fort at Al-Hamra (to which he assigned the name of “ Dar-al-Qabtan,” after the late Captain Warneford) he was able to become master of the village of Ad-Thumair which lies opposite to that fort, and to appropriate rights over the adjoining lands. He even laid claim to Suleik, when the telegraph was in working order up to Dthala, though the portion of the line that lay between Jimil (’Alawf) and Hardaba including the whole of the Habilen was safeguarded by the Kotaibf who received Rs. 500 from us per mensem. This was before our brush with the Kotaibfs and serves as an illustration of ’Alawf methods. With the Kotaibf^ chief and all the tribal akils seeking 1905. restoration to our favour, the Kotaibfs now encountered the 'Alawfs and disputes over the village of Ad-Thumair were of every day occurrence. Shaikh ’Alf Nasir professed himself astounded at our change of attitude towards the Kotaibfs, and fancied he saw in it a diminution of our friendship with him.THE A LAW! . 77 I he ’Alawi can muster but few warriors from amongst his own people and accordingly employs mercenaries from amongst the Dthambarfs and other Radfan tribesmen to combat the Kotaibfs who by reason of chronic blood-feuds in the Radfan Range are always estranged from some or other of these tribesmen. The ’Alawf stock came originally from Lower Yafa. His head-quarters are at the village of Al-Kasha. The Amfr of Dthala tried to patch up the ’Alawf-Kotaibf i9o6 differences but failed owing to his supineness. He has himself many old scores to settle with the Kotaibf tribesmen who regard him as the fons et origo of the events which led to the Kotaibf expedition of 1903. The real master of the Suleik tract continued to be the Sayyid of Ad-Dthubayyat who in olden times used to employ ’Alawf and Kotaibf as his soldiers. Shaikh ’Alf Nasir evinced dissatisfaction with the agreement of 1888 when the then Resident assembled the chiefs near Jimil and arranged a tariff for the levy of transit dues. ’Alawf-Kotaibf relations continued very unsatisfactory owing i to disputes in certain villages in the vicinity of Suleik. Desultory skirm ishes took place round our Suleik fort. The Shaikh was a constant visitor to the Political Agent at Suleik. In April the Shaikh evinced further signs of impatience at the restraint laid upon him in respect of his customs by a close adherence to the dictates of the 1888 agreement. His point was that he was not a party to that convention and that his predecessor had signed his assent thereto against the wishes of his people. He was given to understand that he must perforce comply with the tariff then prescribed which was applicable similarly to other chiefs in the Hinterland. In September the Political Agent with a demolition party of the 81 st Pioneers arrived at Dar-al-Qabtan to demolish the fort, as had been previously arranged at a conference held at Lahej, but Shaikh ’Alf opposed the work and insisted on the Kotaibf post of Ta’izz being first dismantled. The Kotaibf were induced to do this. Shaikh ’Alf, however, went back on his word and refused to allow demolition unless theARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. 78 Rs. 500 promised by one clause of a proposed new agreement with Government were put into his hand. To avoid political complications—as the Kotaibfs had already started dismantling Ta’izz—the sum was paid. In the meantime the Shaikh’s follow ing, taking their cue from him, and backed by many Dthamban tribesmen who had gathered on the spot, tried to thwart the firing-party and one of the latter tribesmen threatened to shoot the Political Agent and his escort The work of demolition was carried out very ably by Lieutenant Alexander of the 81 st Pioneers in the teeth of serious opposition. Shaikh ’All retired and refused to sign the proposed agree ment.The Ami r of Dtha la. The territory actually ruled over by the 'Amfr of Dthala commences on the south side at or about the village of Al- Kafla, and extends up the Wadi Sohaibiya (here called Wadi- al-Khoraiba) as far as the pass near the house of Al-Baishf. Once on the plateau it stretches eastward to Kharafa and Jebel Harir. On the west it is bounded by Jebel Jahaf, and on the north by the districts of Mares (Turkish) and Shaib (Yafaf). In a southerly direction the inhabitants of the Wadi Zobaid, Sufyan and Ad-Dthubayyat own allegiance to the 'Amir. The plain lying between the range of mountains and the sea shore to the northward of Aden only attains an elevation of about 350 feet at Al-Hauta; 15 miles further north it begins to be broken up by hills, and the ground rises more rapidly, until at Al-Kash’a in the ’Alawf territory the height above the sea is 1,800 feet. Here to the east extends the great Radfan range stretching away into the Yafai country : 12 miles further north lies the stony plain of Hardaba through which the Wadf Sohaibiya (here called Wadi Hardaba) runs. The width of the plain is about 6 miles, and it is bounded on the north by the Ad-Dthubayyat mountain, wTich is thrown out like a huge spur irom the tableland on which Dthala is situated. At Al- Kafla the elevation of the torrent bed is 3,050 feet above the sea level. The road follows the Wadi up to the pass near Khoraiba, which is called Nakfl-al-Baishf, wTere the ascent to the tableland is made, and the elevation reaches 5,000 feet. The plain in which Dthala lies, slopes northward to the foot of the Mares range, which towers some 2,000 feet above the plateau. Jebel Jahaf to the westward averages 1,200 feet above the plain, while Harfr to the eastw-ard rises between 2,000 and 3,000 feet higher than the tableland. Jebel Jahaf attains an elevation of 8,000 feet. The area of the portion of the plateau on which Dthala is situated is about 36 square miles : most of the rock which composes the hills is trap, and in many places it is disinte grated and highly coloured ; granite occasionally is present. The climate is salubrious. Rain falls from April to August. Water is found at different levels according to the situation or the wells, and is of good quality—perfectly sw’eet and8 o ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. pleasant to the taste. Irrigation is almost entirely left to the rainfall. About 2,000 acres of land are under cultivation. Jowan, bairi, wheat and Indian corn are grown, as well as pumpkins, radishes, carrots, fennugreek and onions. Forage is plenti u . Below the plateau* the most common shrubs are the acacia, zezyphus, tamarisk and a special species of cactus. Un e hill-sides myrrh trees abound, as also the aloe plant. n e high lands the alub, abab, cactus, myrrh, karadth, babul and other shrubs are common. On the hill-tops coffee and \\aras (bastard saffron) are found. Camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats and fowls are reared. Donkeys are the principal means ot locomotion. The cattle are stout and in good condition. The population of the 'Amin' district proper is estimated at 4,000 souls. The different races and The people. families inhabiting it are as under : Bam Kasim, Banf Sha’fal, Ahl ’Ubadi, Bam-al-Fukaha, Bam Shu’aib, Banf Sa’fd, Al-Masharika, Ahl-Jahaf, Al-Amtur, Al-Hud, Ahl-Zobaid, Al’Asharf, Al-Ashraf, Ahl Da ir, Wais bin ’Alf, Sayyid Hasan, besides Khadim and Jews. These are exclusive of the Kotaibfs and other tribes of^ the Radfan district which own a nominal allegiance to the 'Amfr. Most of the principal inhabitants are land-owners, and assist in tilling their own soil. There are but few merchants and tradesmen. Weaving and dyeing is carried on in a small scale. None, except the Jews, appear very impoverished, and the general bearing of the people is far from warlike. Living is inexpensive. The dress of the people resembles that of the Arabs of the plains, with some trifling difference in the colour and method of arranging the head-dress. The principal towns and villages are—Dthala, Zobaid, Ad- Dthubayyat, Al-Husain, Jebel Harfr, Ar-Rakka, Kharafa, Hujaira, Al-Kafla, Al-Wa ra, Bait-al-Ashraf, Dhi Harran, Ar- Robat, Al-Murkula, Al-Kabar, Al-Mashra’a, Awl Sumaid, Surafi, and Kaukaba. Dthala is the residence of the 'Amfr. The principal Shaikhs were in 1885 Muhammed of Zobaid, ’Talib-al-’Abdalf of Wa’ra, Muiahhar, Mothanna of Al-Kabdr, Shaif bin Saif of - Harfr, ’Abdul Kawf bin Saff of Kharafa, Fadthl and ’Alf Munassar of the Ahl Thomair, MuhammedTHE AMI R OF DTHA'LA. 81 Sdleh-al-Akhram-al-Kotaibf. The Ja’df Halimf and tribes also owe the Amir a semblance of allegiance. Bakri The 'Amir’s income was in 1885 estimated at about 10,000 Revenue. dollars per annum, and is chiefly 1 . . derived from land, taxes on imports and exports, market fees, and fines.

But the first agreement ’ dix Bj made with the 'Amfr was on 2nd October 1880.

In 1872 Sha'fal bin ’Abdul Hadf was 'Amir of Dthala. His death in January of that year caused a division among the electors of the district in the choice of h.s successor One nortion mainly the inhabitants of the towns, including a number of the 'Amiri clan, elected Muhammed Musa id ; the other, consistig of the peasants and cultivators and many of the descendants of ’Abdul Hadi, fixed on Saif bin Abdu Hadi Both candidates were lineal descendants of brothers, each of whom held the chieftainship,—the former being the son of the last Amir but one, and the latter a brother ot the lately deceased Amir. Saif died before the election was completed, and in April 1872 ’AH Mokbil, nephew of the late 'Amir Sha’fal, was un animously chosen ruler. His nomination was intimated to Government and the stipend enjoyed by his predecessors was continued to him and increased in 1881 to 100 dollars. Early in 1873 the wave of Turkish aggression began to approach the borders of the 'Amin district, and ’AH Mokbil, among other chiefs, was solicited by the Ottoman authorities in Yemen. At the outset he was compelled by force ot circumstances to give in his submission to the Porte, but he previously expressed to the Resident at Aden his desire to adhere to his subsidiary stipendiary alliance with the British Government. In May of the above year, ’AH Mokbl applied to the Resident for advice. At that time a Turkish Moh&amp;hz was residing in Dthala, and the 'Amir had been directed to pay 800 dollars a year to the Porte, receiving a stipend of 40 dollars. The Ottoman authorities assisted the 'Amir in collect ing taxes, and the “ haks were farmed out. In consequence of a visit to Aden made by ’AH Mokbil he was summoned by the Kafm-Makam of Ka’taba and impri soned, his uncle Muhammed Musa’id being appointed Mudir of the’ Dthala district in his stead. Strong diplomatic represen tations were made to induce the Porte to release ’AH Mokbil,8.3 THE AMI R OF DTHA'lA. f’rwll/i W L S / reec ! in J anuar y &gt;874- On his return however to Dth.ila he found Mohammed Musd’id unwilling to give up to him the reins of Government. ^ P Assisted by the Turks and in close alliance with Mothanna Muhammed, one of the principal Sha’irf Shaikhs - further possessing considerable influence over the people in conseuuence MnsT d rmer fmit [ e ® S cand &gt;dature for the 'Amfrship, Mohammed Musi id successfully resisted ’Ah' Mokbil, who took up his tTousTthe kharafa ’ fro I m whence he made sundry attempts to oust the usurper.

F84 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. This concluded all active opposition to the 'Amir’s rule, but he continued shorn of a portion of his territory, and to possess little or no authority in the country which he nominally governed. In 1880, in recognition of the good offices of the 'Amir in the settlement of the disputes between the* ’AbdaU and Haushabf, he was presented with a howitzer and the Aden Troop accompanied by an Assistant Resident visited the Dthala district, where much valuable information was obtained, and the survey of the district extended. In 1881 the Kotaibf tribe became very troublesome and commenced exacting dues on the Hardaba route. Ihe Amir was unable to effectually coerce them. Endeavours . were made to settle the matter in an amicable manner, but without success. In July 1884 it was found necessary to support the 'Amir, and accordingly 50 sabres of the Aden droop and a few sappers were despatched against the Ahl Thomair. A few forts were destroyed, and the Kotaibf eventually tendered their submission to the Amir. Mohammed Saleh-al-Akhram, however, maintained a qua si-independence, though professing to obey the 'Amir. After the re-establishment of the 'Amir at Dthala lurkish encroachment and intrigue continued with little or no interrup tion. The peculiar position of many of the durkish villages, wedged in, as it were, among villages subject to the Amir, gave the Turks special facilities for such annoyance and the Political Residents did not fail to impress on Government that the only chance of securing the Amir would be a delimitation of his frontier on a basis of give and take. For some time the Porte successfully resisted or eluded all efforts made by the Foreign Office to establish a settlement on the proposed basis. The result was series of mutual recrimina tions, the 'Amir complaining of Turkish aggressions, and the Turkish local authorities complaining of the 'Amir’s oppres sions. In January 1885 a Turkish force with a gun suddenly encamped between A 1 ]ah'la and A 1 Wa’ra and succeeded in levying tribute from A 1 Wa’ra, Dhf-Harran, Ar-Robat, Kaukaba, Suraff and Awl Sumaid; all villages hitherto regarded as 'Amiri.THE AMl'R OF 1 ) ] HA LA. 85 This new encroachment was duly reported to Government r' c a u m = ub ? e T ent demand for tribute made by the Turks the .

The stipend of 100 dollars formerly enjoyed by Amir A i Mokbil was continued to Shaif bin Saif by Government Reso u- tion, Political Department, No. 7829, dated 30th November iSS). Turkish interference did not entirely cease. In February 1887 the 'Amir brought to notice a threatening letter addressed bv the late Mutasarrif of Ta’izz to some Shaikhs of Adth- Dthdla A remonstrance addressed by the Resident to the Governor General of Yemen elicited a reply couched in very friendly terms. In April 1887 the 'Amir sustained a very great loss in the death of Amar ’Abdalla-al-Baishf, the Shaikh of A 1 Khoraiba, whose influence had invariably been directed to keeping open the roads and upholding the authority of the Amir. In November 1887 the Maresi tribe (subject to the Turks) committed plunder in the village of Lakama Lash ub, but Shai bin Saif had no difficulty in driving the intruders out. At the beginning of 1888 Dr. Harpur, of the C. M. S. (accompanied by his wife), took up his l888 ' residence at Dthdla. In June, by the advice of the Resident, he.returned to Aden, as it appeared the 'Amir was alarmed, the objects of the missionary were suspected, and the 'Amir could not be responsible for his safety. The 'Amir visited Aden in March and was suitably enter tained. * During 1888 the Turks maintained their footing at A 1 Wa’ra, Kaukaba, Awl Sumaid, Ar-Robat, Suraff and DM- Harran, but did not succeed in gaining over any new villages of the 'Amir. But the 'Amir found new causes of alarm in the intrigues of Sayyid Radthwan of Adth-Dthubayyat with the Turks and in the disaffection of his own brother ’Abdul Kawi of Al-Kafla. With the aid of some Halmin and Radfan tribesmen the 'Amir dispossessed ’Abdul Kawi of his forts, and the latter started intriguing ■ with the I urks. Following the example of the Haushabi, the 'Amir then commenced levying a new due at Ar-Radd’. Matters arrived atTHE AMl'R OF DTHA'LA. gy such a pass that the Resident had to intervene. At a meeting of the various chiefs at Al-Mijbah in November the Resident induced each to subscribe to a schedule of rates to be levied in future. The opportunity was taken to obtain from the Kotaibfs and Ahl Thomair a recognition of the 'Amir as their suzerain, the 'Amh: in return granting them the privilege of addressing recommendatory letters to the Resident direct. The Kotaibi's failed to keep this agreement, and the other 1888-89. chiefs who had signed it were requested by the Resident to adopt coercive mea sures. 1890-91. . .^he hirst Assistant Resident paid a visit to Dthdla returning vici Mashwara.

The 'Amir visited Aden and raised the question of several i89S . °f his villages being then under Turkish rule, over which he wished to restore his own authority, dhe Governor General of ^ emen was addres sed on the subject. A fight took place between some Turkish subjects living at Kataba and some of the 'Amir’s sub jects from Lakmat Lash’ub. The Resident again wrote to the Governor General of Yemen about the 'Amir’s com plaints. 1896-97. 1897-98.88 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. The Governor General of Yemen was again requested to issue orders for the settlement of the 'Amir’s claims and was warned that unless he did so,'it would be difficult to prevent the Amir from retaliating on caravans passing through his territory. I he Amir was asked to enter into an agreement with the Ottoman Government. He refused the offer and informed the Resident of his reply, requesting that his stipend might be raised. The Turks occupied “ Turkish Position ” (Jabal Shahad) south of A 1 Jalila and posted a gun there. Major Davies from the Residency visited Dthala and found that the Amir’s influence did not extend north of Dthala town. The British Commission under Colonel Wahab arrived and » encamped at Dthdla below Di Bait (afterwards called J. Tandy). This was in January. The Turkish Commission arrived in February. The Turks occupied Mifari with Regulars. Negotiations between the Commissioners were broken off. 1903. The 'Amir proceeded to the Delhi Darbdr. British and Native troops with guns arrived at Dthala. The Turks .were ordered from Constantinople to evacuate certain positions. They accordingly withdrew from Mifari, J.

The British Commissioners proceeded to Sanah (10 miles north of Dthdla). Negotiations progressed very tardily. In May Radfan aggression led to an expedition from Dthdla against them. The Ahl ’Abdalla were especially chastised and their forts destroyed. In October a force from Dthdla garrison marched on Suleik to punish the Kotaibfs who were raiding the lines of communication. After getting reinforcements from Nobat Dakim the force invaded the Kotaibf country and destroyed some towers and crops.

A Greek merchant and Turkish subject, who was compelled I 9 o 5 . by reason of Zaidf restlessness around Kataba to come to Dthdla, was murdered in his shop at night. No trace of the murderers was effected. His property was attached by the Political Officer and finally restored to his next of kin. Many lurkish deserters passed through Dthdla en route for Aden. The Political Officer with a small escort made a tour through a part of the Halmin country not hitherto visited ; with the exception of one village all the inhabitants were friendly, and especially so the Shaikh of the country, one Ghalib bin Husein. Mahomed Saleh the Kotaibi chief was induced to visit the Political Officer at Suleik and friendly relations were once more established with the whole tribe. The Kotaibf-’Alawf relations were not satisfactory, the Kotaibfs resenting the monopoly of privileges the ’Alawf Shaikh had been creating during the Kotaibf’s temporary disappearance from the Habileln. I he differences were specially bitter in, and around, the village of Ad-Thumair where subjects of both tribes were settled (see under ’Alawi). In October the Acting Resident Colonel Scallon accom panied by General Sir A. Hunter visited Dthdla and Jabal Jihaf to report on the feasibility of making a sanitarium for British troops at the latter place. Mokbil Naji of the Zindani faction on the hill, which was formerly in receipt of a Turkish stipend, fired upon the 'Amir as he was ascending the hill to the village of Lakama (the Shaikh’s Head Quarters) and then fled to Kataba. Famine-stricken Yemenis passed into Dthala during the year and crime was rife. Assistance was given by the Resi dency. Shaikh Awwas of the Ahmedi tract began to show disaffec- &gt;906. tion towards the 'Amir.90 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. In July the Shairf tribesmen^ who had long complained of the 'Amir’s treachery and tyranny, now openly rebelled, and fighting was chronic throughout the year. 1 he people of Jabal Jihaf made a compact with the Shain's against the 'Amur who was taking excessive dues on their hill. A murder was committed at Hazzat al Atid ( Amfrf) of a Turkish subject by Hazza people. Ami'r Shaif was unable to give satisfaction owing to the downward trend of his authority. An improvement of the Khoraiba Pass road was com menced by the 8ist Pioneers The frequent changes in the Kataba Kaimmakamship since 1904 precluded satisfactory settlements being effected of 'Amirf border affairs, and retaliations were common by Arabs on both sides of the border. In December 'Ami'r Shaif went personally to the Radfdn tribesmen to collect mercenaries to attack the Shairf tribesmen who in turn indented on Mares (Turkish) for assistance. The Political Agent by corresponding with the Kaim Makam of Kataba was able to prevent the latter responding to the call. The style of the Political Officer, Dthdla, was early in the year changed to “ Political Agent The latter in December accompanied the Political Resident to Bombay to discuss Hinterland affairs with His Excellency the Governor. During the year the Turkish authorities paid to the Poli tical Agent the sum of £400 sterling which was the sum fixed by the Commissioners as representing the loss of revenues sustained by 'Ami'r Shaif during the wrongful occupation by the Turks of the collection of villages termed Bilad al Ashraf. Shamsi Bey the Customs Officer at Shakhah (Turkish) sought the protection of the Political Agent at Dthdla. He was accused by the Kataba authorities of embezzlement of State monies. The charge was denied. Shamsi Bey even tually returned to Kataba after ensuring that an accountant should be deputed from San’d to examine his books. On 7th January the main body of troops left Dthdla for Aden, the Political Agent being left in Dthdla with an escort of 150 men of the 81st Pioneers and 2 machine guns, while 75 men at each ofTHE AMl'R OF DTHA'LA. 91 the posts of Suleik and Nobat Dakim were left on the Line of Communications. Amir Shaif came up with his mercenaries from the Radfdn Hills and Halmin. All the Radfdns were represented with the exception of the Kotaibfs who refused to join his standard, owing to their differences with him being yet unsettled. Amir Shaif declared to the Political Agent that he would not fight the Shairis as such action would clearly be unpalat able to Government. Within the week the 'Amir changed his mind and attacking the Shairfs by night seized 'the Black Hill to N. of A 1 Jahla (Shain). The next morning some 400 men of his were driven off the hill by men of A 1 Jalila, when the Amir stopped all fighting and paid off his mercen aries. The Jahafis who had joined the Shain cause, kept up a desultory firing towards Dthala town. In February some Muresfs (Turkish) whilst celebrating certain festivities in Habil as Salama ('Amiri), carried off some head of cattle from the 'Amin' village and the latter people were reinforced from Sanah ('Amiri). A fight ensued in which a Jubani man of Shakhab (Turkish) but domiciled at Habil as Salama was killed and 1 Muresi wounded. The Amir sent oxen to Shakhab to propitiate the deceased’s relatives. In the meantime the Kaim Makam of Kataba had asked for reparation. The 'Amir reported that Shaikh Mahomed Ndsir Mukbil of Ad-Dareja fame had entered Ahmedi country and levied taxes. After enquiry the Political Agent found this to be greatly exaggerated but Shaikh Awwas of the Ahmedi wTo resented the rivalry of the Amir’s nominee was warned that he should not ask the assistance of Arabs from across the border to assist him to oust his rival. After receiving this remonstrance, he reported the dismissal of those wdio had transgressed the border, and asked that the 'Amir might be held in check. The Political Agent wrote to the Kaim Makam of Kataba to keep Turkish Arabs under proper control. It was believed locally that the Amir had exaggerated the occurrence to divert attention from his own affairs and to enlist our sym pathy in another quarter so as the better to ensure our co operation to get himself rehabilitated ! This w f as the Political Agent’s view.92 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. In the same way, Shaikh Naji Abdalla of Ad Dukkam ( Amiri) reported that Turkish Arabs had commenced to levy revenue assessment on lands on the British side of the border and further had asked him to extradite Arabs who had taken refuge in Dakkam territory to escape the heavy revenue assess ment levied by the Turkish collectors. The Ad Dakkam Shaikh was warned not to encourage these people to become domiciled in his territory and cau tioned against restraining Turkish Arabs from taking their legitimate revenues from Turkish lands that had been shifted by demarcation across the border to his side. The Kaim Makam of Kataba, who was addressed, replying to both these cases said that he had addressed the Shaikh of A 1 Misha to ^ keep his hands off Dakkam revenues. He added, however, that Shaikh Naji 'Abdalla was apparently giving an asylum to Turkish people who had changed their residence to avoid legitimate revenue collections. The 'Amir was asked to see that the Shaikh refrained from all meddlesome action such as would affect the peace on the border. As to alleged Turkish encroachment in Ahmedi country Kaim Makam ’Abdalla Lutff Bey wired to the Mutassarif of Ta’izz to curb the zeal of Mahomed Nasir Mukbil and his asso ciates. In January Mahomed Husein Bashir of A 1 Yubi territory (Turkish) was murdered by a man of Hazzat-al-Abid ('Amiri) and the Kaim Makam asked for reparation. He was told that the Amir had promised to give relief, but some patience must be exercised since the Amir’s attention was then given to checking the Shairi tribesmen. The Kaim Makam was re minded that there were many cross-cases and that reciprocity of action alone would give peace on the border. In March the 'Amir personally visited the bhairi Akils in their country and slaughtered oxen to heal their mutual differences. A general truce was proclaimed with the Shairis and after a week’s discussion it was resolved that by-gones should be by-gones. The Shairis preferred not to discuss the Amir’s claim to suzerainty but said that they would follow his arms if his bon&amp; hides was made clear. In April the Kaim Makam of Kataba reported increased activity of Hazzat-al-Abid people in the Yubi district.THE AMi R OE DTHA'L.A. 93 In June the Kaim Makam of Kataba recapitulated affairs on the border for which up to date the 'Amir had given no satis faction. He feared reprisals by his people. The Amir asked that these affairs might be adjudicated by the Arabs them selves, and said that he had for a long time had personal deal ings with the Yubi Shaikh and believed an amicable settle ment in all these kindred matters was shortly possible. The Kaim Makam was told that this course commended itself to the Political Agent. The people of Adth-Dthubiyat refused to allow the substitution of Government mules for their camels which were employed to carry water from their well to certain signallers on the hill. As the people were excited and water was run ning short, Captain Reid, Commanding the Escort at Dthala, visited the hill in the Political Agent’s absence from head quarters and communicated with the Political Agent by helio to Yobat Dakim. Owing to the obstinacy of the people and their threatening attitude the Political Agent authorised Captain Reid temporarily to strengthen the post and he asked the Amir’s son to accompany him to reason with the Saiyid of the hill. Owing to the excellent military arrangement made, the hillmen were quieted, and consented to abide by the Political Agent’s decision. On his return, the extra men were withdrawn and matters settled down. Government acceded to the Resident’s proposal to release the fanatic ’All bin Salim from the Yeravda Jail where he had been sent for attempting the life of a member of the Boundary Commission. In July complaints were rife of excess dues levied by the 'Amir at Lahej and at 1 &gt;thala on caravans. The Amir pro fessed to abide strictly by the letter of the 1888 agreement, and alleged that in Dthala only he was taking royalties from his own subjects, and not from caravans of other jurisdictions. In August the Azraki Shaikh, vexed at what he alleged to be the 'Amir’s machinations in setting up the Shaikh’s cousin Husen Saleh as his rival, inaugurated his own customs and taxed caravans plying on the Mashwara route. The Amir promised to enquire and to put a stop to this innovation, and asked the Political Agent to give assistance ! Frequent attacks were made on way-farers at Hardaba ('Amin'). The 'Amir enquired into the matter and imprisoned94 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINTJY OF ADEN. at Dthala one of his soldiers of the Hardaba post, but declared that the outrages were the work of roving Bedouins and dis content among the Ahl Somaan (Kotaibf). He was advised to increase the strength of his Hardaba garrison which he promised to do. A so-called emissary from the ’Imam, self-styled “ A 1 Majnun ” (or the “ madman ”), tried to build a house on Jabal Harir in Amiri limits. He was ousted by the local Darwishes, but, on appealing to the Amir’s son, was permitted to live there, l ie professed to have miraculous powers and collected a small following from the neighbouring Halmin country. He also foretold “ almageddon ” but was not credited by the people generally, opinion being divided as to his powers and sanctity. Pillar No. XXXII (Habil al Khadthar, in Amiri charge) was dismantled and the Amir was told to repair the same. The perpetrators of the mischief were unknown, but the work was probably that of some miscreants who thus took advant age of the 'Amir’s difficulties with his tribesmen. In September the \eravda Jail prisoner was released, and, at his own instance, was permitted to go to Jeddah, he engaging not to re-enter 'Amiri tracts. On the 28th the Political Agent and his escort evacuated Dthdla. On the 29th Suleik fort was demolished by a partv of the 81st Pioneers under the supervision of the Political'Agent; also, at the Amir s invitation, the Hardaba Blockhouse w r as destroyed. Earlier in this month the Resident authorised the Poli tical Agent to hold a conference at Lahej of the chiefs con cerned in the future custody of the Aden-l.)thala road so as to assign to each one his respective bounds of responsibility This was thought necessary as an ancillary measure to the conclusion of certain new agreements proposed to be con cluded with the chiefs of the ’Alawl and KotaibI tr bes. These with the 'Amir of Dthala, some Eaiyids, and the ’Abdall Sultan were all present at the conference. During the sitting it was unanimously agreed that the 'Amir should demohsh his Hardaba Blockhouse, wffiile the ’Alawl agreed to raise “ Dar al- Qabtan ’’, and the KotaibI Shaikh similarly consented to dis mantle his fort of Ta’izz which had been recently built oppositeTHE AMl'R OF DTHA'LA. 95 to Dar-al-Qabtan during the intertribal warfare between ’Alawf and Kotaibf. The ’Alawf Shaikh, while giving his consent, asked the Political Agent to arrange for the demolition of his fort, as less likely to wound tribal susceptibility. At this conference it was resolved nem con that the ’Alawf should be responsible for the road from Jimil ^’Alawf) northwards to the site on which Dar-al-Qabtan stood, while from that point and northwards past the Habilen and Hardaba (which the Amfr had ceded to the Kotaibf) up to Safa Hiliya the Kotaibf were made responsible for the security of caravans and way-farers. It was further stipulated that no new forts were to be erected except with the Resident’s sanction ; also that these arrange ments held good for the road only, and that by them the rights of neither party nor those of outsiders would be preju diced ; but that the ’Alawf-Kotaibf disputes on both sides of this road should thereafter be adjudicated upon by the ’Abdalf Sultan. Before the parties went their several ways the ’Abdalf Sultan concluded documentary agreement (No. 44, Appendix B) between Shaikhs Mahomed Saleh the Kotaibf and ’AH Nasir the ’Alawf, in which the general tenor of the conference’s conclusions were summed up.ML The Wa hidi'. The territory occupied by the Wdhidf is of an irregular shape, situated on each side of the Wadf Maifa’ and enclosed on three sides by hills, whilst on the south is the Arabian Sea. The extent of its sea-coast may be estimated at 50 miles, viz ., from the neighbourhood of Ras-al-Kalb to a point west of Balahaf, where the territory of the 1 'huyaibis commences. It is bounded on the north and north-east by the terri tories of the tribes of Na’man and Burayshf, on the north-west and west by the Upper’Aulakf, on the south-west by the Dhuyaibis, and on the south by the Arabian Sea. The territory may be divided into three districts, namely Habban, Izzan, and Bfr ’Alf. Habban is the most interior district, Bfr ’Ah' is confined to the vicinity of the port of Bir Alf and Izzan is central. The Habban district has an estimated area of 60 square miles, and the whole Wahidf territory is about 160 square miles. , £ \ he Principal towns and villages of the Habban district are the following :-(i) Habban, the capital, situated in the midst of a plain whose elevation is about 3,000 feet.

Ras-al-Kalb has a population estimated at 2,000 souls, but Bfr 'Alf and B-ihh lf contain only a few soldiers.THE WA'HIDI'. 97 The harbour of Bfr ’Alf is a small circular and safe bay one mile long by one and a half broad, exposed, however to the south winds. On the north shore is situated Bir ’Alf •’ to the east, near the entrance, is a curious hill named Shdaron but generally called “ Al-Bostdn ”• to the south of the bay is a narrow strip of land whence rises Husn-al-Ghurdb, a square black, solitary rock placed like a natural fortress to guard the* entrance of the bay. ^ The Sultdn of Bfr Alf has about 2,500 followers, many 01 whom are Hajirfs, a low caste of Arabs from the Wddf Hajir, who come to Bfr ’Alf for purposes of cultivation, and pay over to the Sultdn half the crops raised by them. The Sultdns of Bdlahdf do not muster above 600 imme diate followers. Bdlahdf is an open roadstead exposed to the south-west monsoon, and containing very deep anchor- .. ,, In , t I h , e . centr . e of the WAhidf country are the ruins of JNukb-al-Hajar, situated on a commanding eminence on the right bank of the Wddf Maifa’. It must have been once an impregnable fortress, and is generally identified with the Meepha Metropolis of Ptolemy. It does not belong to the Wdhidf, but to a Bedawin tribe, who are perfectly independent a wild and lawless people held in very bad repute. P r0( ^ ucts °f the country in the vicinity of the \\ ddf Maifa’ at Hauta are wheat, jowdri, bdjri, barley and tahaf. hour crops are reaped yearly, namely, one rain crop and three irrigation. 1 he fields are very neat and regular, and the state of the cultivation generally very superior ' The rotation of crops is observed. The Wddf is bunded for irrigation by numerous stone walls. There is an abundant supply M good water, which is drawn up by bullocks after the Indian system. No fruits are cultivated, except dates and lemons. The few cattle are sent to the neighbouring deserts to graze under the charge of Bedawins. Sheep and goats are numerous, but there are no horses : some were once introduced, but soon disappeared for want of pasture to keep them. In the neighbourhood, however, of Habbdn the supply of water is very limited, procurable only from deep wells. The fields around produce wheat, barley, tahaf, jowdri, bdjri, kinib, (dagoosa), but no dates, coffee or cotton. The scarcity of water prevents irrigation, leaving the fields dependent on B 744—7it 98 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. rainfall; otherwise the rich alluvial soil would yield a grateful return to agriculture. Indigo grows wild, and a species of aloe, of which the common white rope of the country is made, is abundant. The only manufactures are a thick felt for camel saddles and a coarse cloth for lungis. Dyeing is carried on extensively, the indigo being imported from Bir ’All and Aden. Blue is the universal colour worn by both sexes. The rati here is smaller than that of Aden, being 13 dollars’ weight, the latter being 16. The Wahidfs are probably one of the least aggressive tribes in the country. Possessing in he peop e. t h e Wddf Haifa’ one of the most fertile and productive districts of East Yemen, they have settled down, for the most part, into peaceful tillers of the soil, fighting only when obliged to repel intruders. The population may be divided broadly into two classes— the settled agricultural and the Bedawins. The former hold the land on a military tenure, engaging to serve in time of war when called on, and they pay a certain part of their crops to the Sult&amp;n. The Bedawins subsist on their camels, goats, etc., and what they can get from the Sultan and travellers, on whom they levy a “ siydra ” or road toll. There are no nomads. A savage custom exists in this tribe of never accepting the “ diya ” or blood money. Blood can be atoned for only by blood. This custom is not without its advantage in enhanc ing the value of a life by its reflective action, and is the only restraint on unthinking violence. The population is estimated at over 9,000 souls, besides a sprinkling of Jews and Hadthramfs. The Jews are very industrious, but very poor, and are not allowed to own any part of the soil : they are chiefly artisans, journeymen, gold and silver smiths, etc., and their women rear great quantities of poultry. There are no men of any real wealth in the country : indeed, the universal equality of fortune is a remarkable fea ture in the land. Literature and art can scarcely be said to exist. Most of the Shenfs know how to write, and generally the higher Shaikhs, but there are no schools.THE WA'HIDl'. 99 A great fair is held annually on the 12th Rajah at a shrine near Hauta at which the Bedawins assemble in numbers and exchange' their products for the various commodities they need, such as cloth, dates, etc. At other times little traffic goes on : indeed, the internal commerce is small from the simple habits and few wants of the inhabitants, which render them almost independent of external sources of supply. Their ordinary food consists of coarse jowdri or bajri bread, with ghee and dates. Very little rice is consumed, and the Arabs are by no means vegetarians. The only beverage is kishor, an infusion of coffee beans and husks. The inhabitants, as seen at Hauta, are described by Captain Miles as a taller, fairer, and more slender race than the ordinary Arabs ; they wear their long curling hair loose, or fastened behind with a band. Ignorant and superstitious, they are consequently bigoted and fanatical, yet by no means strict Muslims, very lax in religious duties, neglecting their daily prayers, except on Fridays. The women are very fair, with a slight yellowish tint, and go about unveiled—their hair being worn in long ringlets round the head. It is impossible to give any trustworthy estimate of the Revenues. annual revenues, but they cannot exceed 3,000 dollars. The want of authority and power among the Sultdns may be accounted for bylthe absence of wealth or any large source of income on their part, the only means they have being the “ashur,” a sort of property tax, and transit dues, besides the profits arising from any landed property of their own. Most of this income, however derived, has to be paid away to the Bedawins as a retainer for their services when required, and to restrain them from lawless acts. The system of administration is of the patriarchal type. Administration. The Sult ^ ns no real despotic power, and are unable to take the life of any member of the tribe. The Sultdn is, indeed, answerable to the people for all his acts and proceedings ; and his decisions, whether civil or criminal, to be respected, must be in ac cordance with the law of their religion and the customs of the tribes.. In cases of emergency he consults the Shaikhs of the sub-tribes, whose advice he is bound to take and act in ac cordance with. In cases where the members of the tribe are not satisfied with their decisions, and in disputes with otherIOO ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. tribes, a council of Sherffs or Sayyids is called for the final adjustment of the difficulty. These Sherffs are a great power in the State, and exert almost unbounded influence over the tribes in Kast Yemen: even among the Bedawins of the hills they are held in respect and awe from their descent and con sequent sanctity and superior learning. Their advice is sought by all. In ceremonies they often take precedence, even of the Sultdn : many of them make it their special busi ness to act as peace-makers between contending tribes, and their mere presence is often sufficient to put off an impending conflict. There are several Kddthfs in the country, one of whom is resident in Habbdn and the remainder distributed in the various towns and villages. The accompanying genealogical table (Appendix D) gives „ . . f the supposed descent of the reigning Reigning family. ^ of bo « e ^ several of the reigning family. In 1870 the districts of Habbdn and ’Izzdn were under distinct Sultans, but were united under one Sult&amp;n in the time of ’Abdalla bin Omar. Balahaf and Bfr ’Alf were almost independent of the principal Sultdn, but in January 1885 Hddf bin Sdleh being made the principal Sultan, the Wahidfs were for a time practically united under one ruler. The following are sub-tribes of the Wdhidf:—(1) Bil- c , , , laksar so called from their residence on the coast; (2) Habtur ; (3) Aswad ; (4) Harfzf; (5) Ahl ’Umar-bin-Alf j (6) Ahl Khadar; (7) Ahl ’Othaimdn ; (8) Ba Kutmf. The Wahidf tribe takes its name from the founder, Abdul Historical ResumS. Wahid, a celebrated Koreish chieftain who became independent about a hundred years ago when the dominion of the Imdms of San’d came to an end over Yemen. He conquered a large portion of territory from the surrounding tribes, and established his principal residence at Habbdn, a town formerly of consider able importance. Until recent years this tribe had had no dealings with the Aden Residency, but their country was visited by CaptainTHE WA'HIDl'. IOI Miles and M. W. Munzinger, C.B., in 1870, from whose account^ the description of the tribe has been almost entirely drawn. One of the Wdhidf Sultdns* visited Aden in 1872, and uninterrupted communication has since been maintained be tween this tribe and the Aden Residency. In 1874, during the hostilities between Mokalla and Shehr, the Wdhidf Sultdn in a letter to the Resident, advert ing to the war, expressed his desire to remain the friend of the British, and a suitable reply was sent to him. At the close of 1876 the Sultdn complained to the Resident that a subject of his, ’Abdalla bin ’Abdalla Dhuyaibf, had built a fort and levied taxes on the road, and begged assistance in lead and ammunition to suppress him. The Resident did not interfere; but it appeared subsequently that the fort was near Al-Ain, and that the levy of a tax had been suppressed. In 1877 Sultdn Ahmed bin Husain was dethroned, and succeeded by his son Saleh bin Ahmed. In January 1878 several of the Wahidf Sultdns ad dressed a joint letter to the Resident, complaining that negotia tions were going on between the Kaitf Chief of Shehr and Talib bin Hadf bin Talib for the sale of the port of Bfr ’Ah' to the Kaitf. The Wahidfs desired the Resident to close the port of Bfr ’Alf and hoist the British flag at Balahaf until a settlement was effected. The resident advised Talib bin Hadf bin Falib not to be so foolish and imprudent as to sell Bfr ’Alf to the Kaitf, or any one, repeating the advice which had previously been given to his father on the same subject. Sultan Saleh bin Ahmed died in 1881. On the 4th May 1881 his uncle Omar bin Husain was killed by a freebooter named Habootee (who was subsequently slain in 1883), and ’Abdalla bin Omar, his son, became Sultan of Habban and ’Izzan. He visited Aden in October 188f, and was suitably treated by the Resident. In the beginning of 1882 Izzat Pasha was appointed Governor General of Yemen, and on his way from Baghdad to Hodaida to take up his appointment visited Balahaf and Bfr * See “ Account of an Excursion into the Interior of Southern Arabia ” by Captain S. B. Miles, Bombay Staff Corps, and M. Werner Munzinger, C.B., read before the Geographical Society of London, June 12, 1871.102 ARAD TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. ’Ah'. No agreement of any kind passed between Izzat Pasha and the Sultan of Balahaf; but Nasir bin ’Abdalla (since dead), one of the Sultans of Balahaf, apprehensive that Balahaf might be annexed by the Kajtf Chief of Mokalla and Shehr, obtained a Turkish flag which was to be hoisted every Friday and on the approach of a foreign vessel. The Wahidf Sultan of Habban and ’Izzan while denying all complicity in the matter, stated his inability to prevent the Sultdns of Balahaf from flying the Turkish flag, and proclaimed his readiness to go against them with British aid. Subsequently the Wdhidf Sultan, the Sultans of Bfr ’Ah', B&amp;lahaf and Majdaha all wrote almost identical letters to the Resident, praying for British protection. The matter was reported to Government, and from the correspondence which took place in connection with this incident, it appeared that the then Wahidf Sultan of Habbdn and ’Izzdn had little, if any, control over Bfr ’Alf, Balahaf and Majdaha. The independence of Bdlahaf appears to have originated in this way. Sultan’Abdalla bin Ahmed bin Hadf called his three sons, ’Alf, Ndsir and Husain, and told them that who ever would fortify Balahaf should enjoy the revenues of it. Thereupon Nasir bin ’Abdalla and Ahmed bin Nasir, his son, constructed a fort at Bdlahdf, and their descendants enjoy the revenues thereof to this date. These being lineal descendants of Ahmed, son of Hadf bin Saleh, a previous Sultdn, are call ed the Ayal Ahmed ba Hadf as distinguished from the Ayal Tdlib ba Hadf, who are the descendants of Talib, another son of the said Hddf bin Saleh. Majdaha belongs to the Ayal Talib, and Bfr ’Alf is divided between the Ayal Talib ba Hddf and Ayal Ahmed ba Hadf. Sultan ’Abdalla bin Omar was dethroned, and Hadf Saleh of Bdlahaf made Sultan on the 15th January 1885. At the close of 1885 the Wahidf Sultan visited Aden but was obliged to return to his country on 1885 and 1886. account of illness without seeing the Resident who was away at Adth-Dthala. Sultans Saleh bin Ahmed and Mohsin bin Sdleh of Bfr ’Alf and Majdaha visited Aden in June 1886 and had inter views with the Resident, and in October the Wahidf Sultan, Hadf bin Saleh, with his retinue, also visited Aden.THE WA'HIDl'. 103 Sultan Hadf bin Saleh, accompanied by Sultan 'Abdalla jgg 7 bin Hasan bin Mohsin and others, visited Aden in April and had an inter view with the Resident, at which the subject of British protec tion was again touched upon. Allusion was also made to the Ahl Sa’d, a sub-tribe, who two years previously had taken forcible possession of ’Amaki'n and whom the Sultdn was endeavouring to dislodge. In a letter received in October, reference was made to apprehended hostile acts of the Kathfrfs on the pretext of a Kathfrf having been murdered by the Ahl Khalifa (see para graph 4, page 25). The Wahidf Sultdn visited Aden in March and Decem- jggg her 1888 and was suitably entertained. The Political Resident visited the Wdhidf Coast at the end of April 1888. In April 1888 a Protectorate Treaty was concluded at 1888-89- Balahaf and a separate one with the Wdhidf of Bfr ’Alf each chief being granted an annual stipend of 120 dollars. Sultan Hddf bin Saleh and his brother Ahmed bin Sdleh 1889-90. visited Aden and the latter voluntarily signed a document expressing his concurrence with the treaty. The Sultdn offered to sell the port of Bdlahdf and declared i890 . 9I . that if we would not buy it he would sell it to some foreign power. He was reminded that this would be contrary to the treaty he had lately signed. In July 1892 Sultan Had! bin Sdleh the Wahid 1 of Balahaf i892 resigned the chieftainship in favour of his younger brother Mohsin bin Saleh, who was recognized by Government. In March 1893 Sultdn Mohsin bin Saleh the Wdhidf of Bfr l8g3 ’Alf died and was succeeded by Sultdn Sdleh bin Ahmed to whom the usual annual stipend was continued. In this same year the question of the sale of Bdlahdf was again raised. The Sultan commenced hostilities against his tribesmen and came to Aden and made exorbitant demandsIO4 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OE ADEN. for arms and ammunition. On these being refused he returned the British flags which had been given him and again threaten ed to sell Balahdf. On his return there he plundered a Sambuk and began to intrigue with the French. He was ordered to come into Aden and make his submission, but in the meanwhile his tribesmen drove him from his capital Habban. He sought refuge with the Upper ’Aulakf Shaikh with whose help he eventually retook his capital. In the meantime Sdleh bin ’Abdalla was elected chief. The ex-Sultdn continued to intrigue with foreign powers and succeeded in importing some French arms into the country. In connection with this his brother Ahmed bin Saleh was imprisoned at Aden. As the new Sultan was overawed by the threats of Husain l8g4&lt; bin Sdleh the ex-Sultdn’s brother and _ was afraid to hoist the British flag, the Native Assistant Resident was sent in September 1894 to remonstrate with him. Husain bin Sdleh threatened to fire on him if he hoisted the British flag and in consequence an expedition was sent to Bdlahdf consisting of H. M. S. “ Bramble ” and the R. I. M. S. “ Dalhousie ”, 104 Native In fantry and 25 Sappers. The expedition was successful in capturing Husain bin Sdleh without firing a shot and brought him back to Aden as a political prisoner. Sultdn Saleh bin ’Abdalla also came on a visit to the Resident. On the 15th March 1895 a Protectorate Treaty was concluded with the Sultan by which his annual stipend was increased to 360 dollars. Husain bin Sdleh and Ahmed bin Saleh were released, the former leaving a hostage. 1895-96. ex -Sultdn paid a visit to San’a and tried to obtain Turkish assistance. During their visits to Aden the Sultdns of Bdlahdf offered to mortgage ^rd of the port of Bdlahaf. On 1 st June 1896 the Sultdn of Bi'r ’Ah' visited Aden and signed an additional Protectorate Treaty, his stipend being increased to 360 dollars a year. A dispute arose between the Wdhidf and Kaitf over Maifa’, 1897-98. which the ] atter claimed. The Wdhidf of Bfr ’All complained that Native Craft from the Kaitf ports were forbidden to enter any Wdhidf ports. The Kaitf were written to and told to remove this prohibition and to effect a peaceful settlement of the dispute.THE WA'HIDl'. io 5 The Sultdn of Balahdf asked for a new Protectorate Treaty to guard him against the encroachments of the Kaitf but he was informed that he was protected by the former treaty. As this matter was still unsettled Government were re- 1898-1900. quested to address the Jemadar of . _ Shehr and Mokalla on the subject. /-uruT 61 * e y entuall y intimated that he would appoint his son Ghahb the Governor of Mokalla as his repr sentative. Maifa’ was eventually bought by the Kaitf from the Wdhidf of Bfr Ail. In March Sultans Saleh bin ’Abdalla, Ahmed bin Sdleh 1901. anc i Mohsin bl n Saleh were interviewed . .. 0/1 , by the Resident. They asked that bm eh m^t be recognised as titular chief of the ahidf. The matter was referred to Government, who refused to comply with their request. In May the Ahl Adam attacked Bdlahdf while the R.I.M.S. Mayo ” was there, the Commander of the “ Mayo ” gave some assistance in water and food to the inhabitants. In June a Kaitf Sambuk was wrecked near Bdlahaf, and 1902. Sultan Mohsin seized its cargo which . . . consisted of specie. In July the First Assistant Resident went to Bdlahaf on the R. I. M. S. “ Mayo” accompanied by a party of troops and H. M. S. “ Perseus ”. As the specie was not given up the fort was destroyed and Sultan Ahmed bm Saleh was again brought to Aden as a political prisoner. The port was closed against all shipping. .Sultan Sdleh bin ’Abdalla came to Aden and asked for assistance to recover the specie from his cousin. In October it was restored through the ’Abdalf. Sultdn Mohsin bin Saleh refused to come to Aden to 1904. tender his submission till December I 9°4 when he came to Aden and was interviewed by the Resident. Sultdn Sdleh bin ’Abdalla sold his share in the port of 19 0 5 . Bdlahdf to the Kaitf without permis sion of the other share-holders and without obtaining the sanction of Government. Government declined to permit the arrangement. Affairs in Bdlahdf continued to be unsatisfactory until, after a visit by106 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. the First Assistant Resident to ascertain the feelings of the tribesmen, Mohsin bin Saleh was re-elected titular chief of Balahdf, and a fresh treaty (No. 42, Appendix B) made to which he was the sole signatory. . Sultan Ndsir bin Sdleh of Habban made overtures assert ing his independence and asking to be admitted to treaty relations. He was not, however, encouraged in this aspiration. The ex-Sultan Saleh bin ’Abdalla had a long-standing dispute with Sult&amp;n Mohsin bin Saleh as to his share in the dues of the port of Balahdf; and the quarrel on this subject increased. The former requested the Resident to settle the dispute but he refused to interfere. Sultdn Saleh bin ’Abdalla then proceeded to instigate some of the tribesmen to close the port of Balahaf and for a time succeeded in doing so ; Sultan Mohsin in spite of his supposed greater influence and power, being apparently unable to prevent him. Captain Mosse, Assistant Resident, visited Balahaf in January and handed over a copy of the ratified Treaty of 1905 to Sultdn Ahmed bin Saleh, brother of Sultdn Mohsin, the latter not being present. Ahmed bin Saleh was informed at the same time of the displeasure of Government at his action in interfering with the cargo of a buggalow that had visited his port. It was found that the port of Balahaf was still effectually blocked by Saleh bin ’Abdalla’s retainers in a Dar on the road to the Interior. In February Sultan S 41 eh bin ’Abdalla visited Aden with the sons of the Bn: ’All Sultan, bringing with them an agreement for the sale to Bir ’Alf by Saleh bin ’Abdalla of a -|- share in the port of Bdlahaf. The agreement also involved the taking over by Bn* ’AH of a share in the administration of Balahdf. They asked Government’s sanction to the agree ment. The Resident declined to consider this at all until Sultan Mohsin’s views on the subject should be ascertained. The following month Sultan Mohsin came in to Aden. He repudiated the proposed Bfr ’Alf agreement entirely. He had an interview with the First Assistant Resident and the Resident, in which he was given to understand that the Resident was not at all satisfied with his apparent inability to maintain tranquillity in his country or to come to an amicable understanding with Saleh bin ’Abdalla.THE WA'HIDI 7 . I07 In April a request of the Kaitfs to be allowed to again negotiate for the purchase of a share in Bdlahdf was referred for the consideration of Government. In June a mission was received from the Ahl Hair who occupy a portion of the Wahidf-Kaitf Hinterland. They wished to enter into treaty relations with Government but their overtures were politely rejected. The Sultan of Bfr ’Alf visited Aden in June. Referring to Balahaf affairs he put all the blame for recent trouble on Sultdn Mohsin bin Saleh. In July Government wrote to the effect that the Sultdn of Bfr ’Alf should be discouraged from interfering in Balahdf affairs. He was informed accordingly. In August Sultan Mohsin bin ’Alf denied the truth of a complaint that he had confiscated a dhow laden with jowari belonging to the Ahl Deyaib, a sub-tribe with whom he was on bad terms, but admitted having seized a fishing boat which had been firing into Balahaf and detained the 8 bags and jowari it contained. He complained vaguely that the Bir ’Alf Sultdn was inciting his subjects against^him. He was advised to manifest the sincerity of his desire for tranquillity by return- mg the boat and its cargo to their owners.The Shaikh of ’Irka. The port of ’Irka, which has been alluded to under the ’Aulakf tribe, is situated about twelve' miles from Haura, a Dhuyaibf seaport. From oral traditions it is believed that about two centuries ago an ancestor of the Badds family settled at Haura and was worshipped as a saint after his death, and the practice has descended down to the present times. A century after this holy man’s death some of his descendants came to reside at ’Irka, and being pious men and much respected by the neigh bouring inhabitants they were elevated to the dignity of Shaikhs under the Wahidf chief of the day. About twenty years ago the tribespeople around finding much inconvenience from the want of a port, and having to go to Bfr ’Ah', Balahaf, or Maj- daha, for the necessaries of life, induced the Badas Shaikh to open a port at ’Irka. The Wahidf chief on hearing of this remonstrated; but the Shaikh summoning his relatives and the surrounding tribesmen, after consultation with them, deter mined to brave the matter out. The Wdhidf chief, powerless to prevent it, and fearing to coerce a Shaikh held in such superstitious sanctity by the Dhuyaibfs and others, left the port alone. I he Shaikh of ’Irka often acts as mediator between the ’Adthmf, Sulaimdnf and Husainf sub-tribes of the Dhuyaibf in their quarrels. This Shaikh, like the Wdhidfs, applied to be placed under the protectorate of the British Government in 1882. The Shaikh of ’Irka visited Aden in October and had an l8g7&gt; interview with the Resident, and was suitably entertained. The Political Resident visited ’Irka at the close of April l8888g 1888, when a protectorate treaty was concluded with Shaikh Awadth bin Mohammad Badas (on the 27th April) and the chief was granted a stipend of 80 dollars a year.

He was succeeded by Shaikh Ahmed bin Awadth bin Moham- 1899-1900. 1901. mad Badds. A new protectorate treaty was con cluded with the latter in January 1902. At an interview with the Resident, the Shaikh endeavoured 1905. t0 show that the stipend which he received was less than that promised him by the agreement of 1902. He was given to understand that this was not the case. The Shaikh visited Aden in May. 1902. 1907.The Shaikh of Lower Haura. A protectorate treaty was concluded with Shaikh ’Abdalla Mahomed Ba Shahid the Dhuyaibf 1888 89 ' on the 28th April 1888, when the Political Resident visited Haura, and the chief was granted a stipend of 50 dollars a year. The Lower Haura Shaikh visited Aden and was suitably l88g9a entertained, and again in 1892. On 6th May 1895 Shaikh ’Abdalla Mahomed Ba Shahid died and was succeeded by Said bin l89S ' ’Abdalla Ba Shahid. In February 1896 the latter resigned and was succeeded by his brother Ahmed bin ’Abdalla. l896. The Resident visited Haura, the newly appointed Shaikh returning with him. Shaikh Ahmed bin ’Abdalla died on 1st March. He was succeeded by Shaikh Sdleh bin I90 °' Awadth. The Shaikh visited Aden in 1902, and on the 7th April signed a new protectorate treaty. The Shaikh visited Aden in May and was given a present of 2 rifles. 1907.The Mahri Tribe of Kishn and Sokotra. The territory of the Sultnn of Kishn and Sokotra embraces not only the island of Sokotra and its dependencies, but a large tract on the Arabian mainland opposite, which is bound ed on the east by Damkut and on the west by the jungle of Masna’a. No estimate can be given of its extent.* .The population of Sokotra is estimated at 9,000 souls, while that of the mainland, including many Bedawin tribes, is reported to amount to 50,000. The principal towns and villages on the mainland are Kishn (the capital), Dafkbt, Jubail, Shin, Shanhft, Wadf, Daghbant, Kidffut, Kaish, Khartanut, Harut, Haswain, Mokhaiffk! Saihut. The principal town in Sokotra is Tamrida. The language of the Mahrf tribes is quite distinct from The people. ^ Arabic. It has been supposed with great reason to be the remains of the ancient Himyaritic language ; and the Mahrfs pride themselves on the antiquity of their tribe, claiming a descent from the tribe of Ad ibn Ans ibn Irem ibn Sham (Shem) ibn Nuh (Noah).— (Haines.) The poorer classes show great indifference to religion and many are unable to repeat the prescribed forms of prayer. Their males are circumcised just before marriage, frequently not till they are 20 years of age. Their long bushy hair is then shaven and replaced by a turban if they can afford one: if not, their hair is gathered together so as to form a round knot at the back of the head.—(Haines.) They carry a sword, which is never sheathed, and are armed with a stick, sharp-pointed at each end, which they use very dexterously. They also make use of stones as weapons of offence. In 1847 ^e revenue of Sokotra was estimated by Lieute- Revenue nant Cruttendenat 320 dollars collect ed in kind, but in 1877 Captain Hunter, # Captain Haines in bis Memoir on the South and East Coasts of Arabia gives the limits as from Misendt (t. e.

Some revenue is derived by the Sultan from customs duties at Kishn and Sfhut, but the amount cannot be estimated. The Sultan usually resides at Kishn, one or more of his nephews residing at Sokotra as his Administration. , , • „ representative. When a murder is committed, the matter is enquired into by mediators, who arrange a truce, and blood money is paid. On expiry of the truce the heirs of the murdered man are at liberty to take their revenge. In cases of robbery the offender is compelled to _ grant compensation; but no punishment by way of amputation of the hand, or otherwise, is inflicted. There is generally a Kddthi in each village, who performs marriage ceremonies only. Kishn and Sokotra have belonged for a long period to the family of Ahl ’Afrfr, a Mahri tribe. Reignmg family. ’Afrfr do not number above 20 persons. A genealogical table of the reigning family is attach ed (Appendix D). The ’Afrfr is a Mahrf tribe. The following Mahrf tribes are reported to be subject to the Sultan of Kishn and Sokotra :— Sub-tribes and septs. Bait Ziyad. Bait Harawuz. Bait Bararshl. Bin Mahamid. Bin ’Akld. Bin Jadhf.

The connection of the British Government with Sokotra commenced in 1834, when Captain Historical Resumd. Ross, of the Indian Navy, was sent on a mission to Sokotra, and concluded an agreement (No. XCV) with Sultan Ahmed bin Sultan of Fartdsh and his cousin Sultdn bin Amr of Kishn, by which they consented to the landing and storage of coal on the island by the British Government.the mahri' tribe of kishn AND SOKOTRA. I 13 The island was surveyed by Commander Haines, and in i8 35 negotiations were undertaken through him with the chief Amr bin Tawari, for the purchase of the island, and in antici pation of their success a detachment of European and Native troops was sent to take possession. The chief, however, dis played an unconquerable aversion to the sale of the island, or even the cession of a portion of it as a coaling depdt, and the troops were withdrawn.* In 1838 the chief proposed to farm the island to the British Government; but the capture of Aden, while the proposal was under discussion, rendered it unnecessary to secure Sokotra as a coaling station. In 1844 a severe drought occurred, and when the island vvas visited in 1847 by Lieutenant Cruttenden he found it almost depopulated. This officer ascertained that two French war vessels had examined the eastern point of Sokotra with the idea, it was supposed, of purchase. At the close of 1874 the Political Resident of Aden called attention to the advance of the Egyptians along the Somali Coast to Guardafui, and solicited instructions in view thereof with regard to Sokotra, which was also at that time visited by a Turkish training ship. J The Resident, acting on instructions received from the Government of India, proceeded in H.M.S. “Briton” to Sokotra and Kishn in January 1876, and an agreement (No. XCVI) was concluded with the Sultan of Kishn and Sokotra by which, in consideration of a payment of 3,000 dollars and an annual subsidy of 360 dollars, he bound himself, his heirs and successors never to cede, sell, or mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the island of Sokotra or any of its dependencies—the neighbouring islands. s In April 1876 Captain Hunter, Assistant Resident, visited Sokotra, and delivered copies of the ratified treaty to Sultdn Saad, the resident Governor, and he again in 1877 went to Sokotra, and was permitted to make a trip inland. He found that the execution of the treaty had strengthened the Governor's hands, and that the revenue had doubled. * An account of Commander Haines’ proceedings will be found in the Tournal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. 15, 1845, P art I- B 744- 8M 4 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. Communications between Sokotra and the Aden Residency have since continued unbroken, and in 1877 Sultan Salem bin E&lt;a visited Aden. Sultan Sa’fd bin Hamed died in 1877* Between February and April 1880 Dr. Balfour, Professor of Botany to the University of Glasgow, visited Sokotra, being deputed by the British As ociation and Royal Society to report on the flora and fauna of the island. For his kind treatment of Dr. Balfour a present of a signal gun and powder were made to the Sultan, accompanied by a letter of thanks from the Resident. In 1881 and 1882 Professor Dr. Schweinfurth and Mon sieur Chartrand Manuel, a French Naturalist, visited the island for purposes of scientific research. At the close of 1883 the Resident was directed to report what facilities existed for erecting and maintaining a lighthouse on the eastern extremity of Sokotra, and with this object the Resident personally visited the island in January 1884 accom panied by the Port Officer and Executive Engineer. A site was selected near Ras Radrasa, and in May 1884 Captain King, Assistant Resident, again visited Kishn and Sokotra, and succeeded in obtaining the Sult&amp;n’s consent to the erection of a lighthouse on the condition that the site should remain his property. In January 1885 the Government of India express ed its readiness to build and maintain the lighthouse on the understanding that the whole cost of erection, maintenance and protection should be re-imbursed by Imperial funds, and that the lighthouse should in no way be regarded as property for which the Government of India was responsible. In 1884 the S. S. “ Airy ” was wrecked near Dthafar, and the shipwrecked crew hospitably treated by the Sultan of Kishn and the Shaikhs of Ras Nishton and Tibut, to whom a sum of Rs. 500 was distributed as a mark of the approval of Government. At the close of March 1886 the Political Resident w’as authorized by the Government of India, under instructions from Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, to conclude an additional treaty with the Sultan of Kishn and Sokotra, whereby Sokotra and its dependencies should be placed under British protection. With this object, Captain Sealy, Assistant Resident, was despatched to Sokotra and Kishn in H.M.S. “ Dragon ”, and a treaty {vide Appendix B) was executed on the 23rd April 1886.r THE MAHRl' TRIBE OF KISHN AND SOKOTRA. I 15 On the 23rd October 1886 the Political Resident, General Hogg, C.B., proceeded in H.M.S. “ Penguin” to Kishn and delivered to the Sultdn a ratified copy of the Treaty executed on 23rd April. Sultan Sdlem, the Governor of Sokotra, being then at Kishn, was granted a passage over to Tamrfda, where on the 30th October the Union Jack was formally hoisted, saluted on shore by a Guard of Marines and from H.M.S. “ Penguin ” by a Royal Salute of 21 guns.

Friendly communications were maintained with the Sultan, jggj' an d Kishn was visited by H. M.’s gun boat on the station during the year. On the 30th May the North German Lloyd’s S.S. “ Oder ” was wrecked near Ras Radrasa. Her Majesty’s Ship “ Al gerine ” visited the spot in June, and the Native Assistant Resident was despatched to advise the local Governor, Sultan Salem, in September. When the south-west monsoon had moderated, the local agents of the owners succeeded in salv- ing a great part of the cargo. friendly communications were maintained with the Sultan, l888 and the Political Resident visited him in May 1888. The Sultan’s subsidy was increased during the year by 120 dollars (G. R. No. 4461, Political Department, dated 30th June 1888). i888 _ 89 .

The district inhabited by this tribe is hounded on the west by the Wahidf and the Bedawin tribes of Al-Bahaish and ’Akabira, on the east by the ’AHbira, Barn' Hasan and Ahl- ■ al-Haik, on the south by the Arabian Sea, and on the north by the Kathfrf. The country is intersected by chains of hills, in between which there is arable land. The date and sidr trees abound. I he arable land is estimated at about 8,000 acres, and the whole area at 375 square miles. The country produces dates, tobacco, sheep, goats bullocks, camels and donkeys. The climate is healthy, and the population is estimated at about 18,000 souls. The principal towns with their approximate populations are:—Mokalla (the capital), 12,000 souls; Fuwwa (a port) 1,500 souls; Burum (a port), 1,500 souls; Khirba, 500 souls • Khuba, $00 souls; Al-Bakarain, 400 souls ; Harshiyydt 700 souls; Ihilih, 400 souls ; Rukub, 700 souls. Mokalla is built on the side of a lofty steep protected on the land side by a strong chain of forts. In the south-west monsoon its harbour is too exposed, and the adjacent port of Burum is then, used by the shipping.

Theft is punished by amputation of the hands, and ex pulsion. In cases of wilful murder the murderer is laid by the s |^ e of the murdered person, and butchered. In cases of homicide by misadventure the offender is usually released after a short period of imprisonment. In civil matters the debtors are confined until the ruler is satisfied they have no means to pay their debts. On release they are bound to give a written bond to their creditors, who may exact payment should the debtors be again in a prosperous condition. There is no limitation. The Kasadf is no longer the reigning family at Mokalla which, with its dependencies, passed Eeigning family. into the hands of the Kaitf in 1881 ; but a genealogical tree of the ex-Nakib s family is attached (Appendix D). The Kasadf being itself a sub-tribe originally of the Yafaf has no sub-tribes properly speak- Sub tribes. ^ . h u t since the Kasadf became sole ruler of Mokalla a sub-division has been developed called the Nakhkhabfn. Tradition asserts that Ahmed bin Sdlem, a Yafaf resident of the village of Shaiwaha, was the Historical Resume. founder of the little kingdom of Mokal la. Impelled by the advice of a Sayyid he left his native village and settled at Mokalla, which was then a resort of sea birds, and contained deposits of guano only. The Kasadf dominion over Mokalla terminated in November 1881, when the Kaitf jemaddr of Shehr became ruler also of Mokalla and its dependencies, as will be found fully described in the historical resume of the Hadthramut, Shehr and Mokalla. The ex-Nakfb with a number of his Shaikhs and followers left Mokalla, to reside in the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar. A sum of money paid by the Kaitf was invested by Govern ment for the ex-Nakfb’s maintenance. He, however, persist ently refused to accept it until August 1888 when he at length did so. By that time the sum originally invested amounted with accumulated interest to Rs. 2,30,200.The Kaiti'. The country in the possession of the Kaiti before Mokalla snd its dependencies passed under the dominion of the Kaiti Jemadar, extended from Kaisiin on the east to the Mokalla territory on the west.

The country inhabited by the Kathfrf tribe was in former ages of vast extent, reaching from the ’Aulakf districts on the west to the Malm tribe on the east, and including the seaports of Mokalla and Shehr. Civil wars led to the interference of the Yafaf, and much of the Kathfrf territory within the past 40 years came under the sway of the Kasadf and Kaitf, and the Kathfrf now possess no seaport at all.

Resume of Mokalla, Shehr and Hadfh- ramut up to the year 1881 in which Mokalla and its dependencies passed under the sway of the Kaitf. During the long-protracted struggle between the Kasadf and Kaitf, the Kathfrf usually took the part of the Kasadf. At the end of 1883 Sultan ’Abdalla bin SMeh, one of the Kathfrf chiefs, visited the Resident at Aden. His chief object was to ascertain what attitude the British Government would maintain in the event of the Kathfrf attacking the Kaitf with a vhew to repossessing themselves of the ports of Mokalla and Shehr. ’Abdalla bin Saleh also visited Zanzibar with intent to intrigue with the ex-Nakfb of Mokalla, from whom, however, he failed to obtain any material assistance. The Government of India in March 1884 directed that the Kathfrf be warned that an attack upon Shehr and Mokalla would be viewed with grave displeasure, and that, if necessary, a gunboat would be sent to support the Kaitf ruler. In may 1884 Captain King, Assistant Resident, was deputed to visit Shehr and Mokalla in H. M. S. “ Woodlark ” to assure the Kaitf Jemadar in the most public manner that124 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. Government would support him in the event of any attack on his ports. It was ascertained that there was no imminent danger of an attack upon the Kaitfs p^rts, but hostilities might be expected to break out at any moment should the Kathfrfs insist on the cession to them of a seaport , (Shehr being preferred by them), a demand which the Kaiti firmly refused to accede to. The Kathfrf attacked and captured Dhufar and killed the son of its governor. The latter escaped l89S ' to Murbat and appealed for help to the Tmam of the Muscat. The Kathfrf asked for assistance from Sayid Fadthl the Mopla Outlaw. Hnally l897 * Dhufar was retaken by the ex-governor in March 1897. Of intercourse between the Aden Residency and the Kathfrf there has never been much and during the last 20 years practically none at all (1907)-Historical Resume' of Mokalla, Shehr and Hadthramu't.* I-T t ^ ie east of the Wdhidf tribe is the province called Hadthramiit of which it is necessary to give some account, m 6 ] ^ Gn Residenc y ^ as ^ on g ^ ad relations with the chiefs Tn °« a ^ a an ^ ^ ledr &gt; w hose territories are therein situated. e affairs of Shehr and Mokalla being inextricably mixed together, a single historical resume will suffice, and be more intelligible than any attempt to separate their histories. About four hundred years ago, Hadthramut, including the seaport 5 of Mokalla, Shehr, etc,, was entirely in the hands of the Kiithirf tribe. Owing to internal disputes a member of the reigning family, by name Amr bin Badr, sought the intervention of the Yafaf. By the latter’s assistance, Amr bin Badr was proclaimed ruler of Hadthramiit, with the ex ception of the seaports which the Yafaf retained for them selves, and Shibdm, which remained in the hands of the Kathfrf. The Yafaf thus obtained a firm footing in Hadth ramut. Since that time constantly renewed struggles were made by the Kathfrf to regain their ancient seaports. Mokalla, however, remained (until a few years ago) in the possession of the Kasddf, a sub-tribe of the Yafaf, and Shehr was held by the Ahl Baraik until 1866. Mokalla and Shehr are now united under one ruler (the Jemadar of Shehr), and the follow ing is a summarized account of the events which led to this result. Some seventy years ago Omar bin ’Awadth, of the Kaiti sub-tribe of the Yafaf, left his native country and sought service under the Nizam of Hyderabad. He soon became wealthy, and married an Indian lady, by whom he had five sons :— (1) Muhammed, long since dead. (2) ’Awadth, who obtained the rank and dignity of Jemadar Nivvaz Jung under the Nizam, and became ruler of Shehr. (3) ’Abdalla, who always represented the family in Hadthramut. * For an account of Hadthramut see Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government, No, CCXII, New Series.HISTORICAL RESUME' OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC. I2 7 In January 1851 the Naki'b dreading a second attempt bv he lurks to capture Mokalla offered it to the British Govern 7 N e t(L V M 1C L h decllI ] ed hls proposal, and on 26th April i8si the towardc^tlf the ol Shehr, ’Alf Najf, behaved very kindly towards the shipwrecked portion of the crew of the “ Sir eorge Anderson, and his conduct was duly acknowledged. at i! n „ the e ' d ° f ,’ 8 5 S the Resident, General Coghlan, v rsited Mokalla and Shehr, and found the slave trade in active opera- 1011 at those ports—Mokalla especially being an entrepot for aMn TV 116 EaS ‘ S 0351 ° f Africa ’ Za ™ h ^ the Somali and Dankah ports, pending despatch to their final destination in Yemen, the Hijaz or Persian Gulf. . 1 863 General Coghlan was successful in obtaininp- the ^gnature of a treaty (No. LXXI) by the Naki'b of Mokalla abohshmg the slave trade in his dominions, and the chief of Miehr entered into a similar engagement. In the following year the Resident, Colonel Merewether, proceeded to Mokalla and presented the Naki'b with two small guns. Meanwhile the struggle between the Kathfrf and Yafaf continued, and the latter obtained assistance from their representatives at Hyderabad, the Kaitf family above men tioned, both in men and money, until at length the Yafai besieged and conquered Shibdm. at M b °. Ut ^ , time ’ Abdalla bin ’Alf the ’Aulakf (afas Mokkadam Jung) sent money from Hvderabad, and purchased from the Ahl Baraik of Shehr the place called Sidda or Hazm not far distant from Shehr. In the middle of 1866 the Kathfrf captured Shehr and Ah Ndjf, the ruler on behalf of the Ahl Baraik, fled to Aden. I he Kathfrf then attacked Mokalla, but were repulsed. I he Kaitf, ’Awadth bin Omar (or Niwaz Jung), with assistance obtained through the Nizdm’s Court, left Bombay with a party of armed Arabs, and, calling at Aden, obtained arms and stores, and attacking Shehr by sea and land speedilv reduced and captured that port. Instead of restoring Shehr to the Ahl Baraik the Kaitf kept it, and shortly after united with the Kasadf Nakfb of Mokalla, Salah bin Mohammed, in an expedition against their mutual foe, the Kathfrf. 'I hey128 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. were, however, defeated, and returned to their respective ports. Niwdz Jung then returned to Hyderabad, leaving his brother ’Abdalla in Hadthramut. In 1867 a Turkish vessel of war visited Mokalla, and endeavoured .to assert iurkish sovereignty over Mokalla, Shehr and the whole coast; but these pretensions were evaded by the chiefs, who desired to obtain the protection of the British flag. In June 1869 the Nakfb of Mokalla renewed his request for annexation by the British Government, being still apprehensive of lurkish aggression ; moreover, he had quarrelled with his old ally, the Kaiti Chief of Shehr, and was not secure from the inroads of the Kathin. The Government of India were unable to accede to the Nakfb’s desire, but addressed the Foreign Office with a view of restraining the Turkish authorities from threatening his independence. The Kathfrf also solicited that they might not be interfered with if they attacked Shehr, and it was suggested that Government might with advantage assist in settling the differences between the 5 various tribes. Government, however, declined to be mixed up in such quarrels. In April 1873 Sir Bartle Frere visited Mokalla, and revived by a fresh engagement (No. LXXII) the Slave Trade Treaty made by Sir William Coghlan in 1863. He also visited Shehr, but none of the Kaiti family were found to be present, but in November 1873 the Jemadar of Shehr also signed a treaty (No. LXXIII) abolishing the slave trade in his dominions. On the nth May 1873 Salah bin Mohammed, Nakfb of Mokalla, died, and was succeeded by his son Omar, a weak- minded youth. Perceiving his opportunity, the Kaitf Niwaz Jung at once hastened from Hyderabad, landed at Mokalla, and proceeded to Shehr. Thence he despatched 4 Sayyids to the Nakfb to demand payment of 1,60,000 dollars alleged to have been received by the Nakfb’s late father as the value of assistance rendered eight years previously by the Kaitf to the Kasddf against Sultdn Ghalib bin Mohsin the Kathfrf. At this time the Nakfb’s forces were absent subduing a revolt at Daw’an, and Niwaz Jung the Kaitf seized the occasion to pay a quasi-friendly visit to the Nakfb, taking in his train 500 soldiers. He was received with all honour, and increased the number of his followers by constant accessionsHISTORICAL RESUME' OF MO KALLA, SHEHR, ETC. 129 stronT 1° H S ° m , en , At len gth deeming himself sufficiently strong, he demanded payment of the debt above noted or as an alternative that half of Mokalla and Burum should become the property of the Kaitf at the price of 2 40 000 dohars. The Nakfb being helpless accepted the alternative and an agreement (which will be found in Aitchison’s 1 reat.es, Volume XI, Revised Edition, Appendix .0) was made k 3r ?he hala 129 °' Th e Jemad^ of Shehr paid up 80,000 dol- n ’ j j ' nCe , due aS the P nce of half Mok alla and Burum after deducting the debt of 1,60,000 dollars. After receipt of the 80,000 dollars the Nakfb recalled his troops from Daw’an and trapped the Kaitf at Mokalla, but eventually allowed him to depart unconditionally. The Nakib then entered into an alliance with the Kathfrf and also obtained the assistance of Mokaddam lung the Aulaki, who had been appointed by the late Nakib his executor and guardian of his sons. With this aid the Kasadf Nakfb captured Al-Ghail, Ravydn and Masajida, but was repulsed from Shehr. The Kaitf attacked Burum, but was repulsed. Al-Ghail was garrisoned by the Kathin, and Rayyan by the Kasadf. In February ,874 the S. S. “ Pehlwan,” registered and sailing under British colours, was despatched from Bombay by a member of the Kaitf family for the ostensible purpose of carrying on trade, but in reality to render effective aid to the Jemadar in transferring his troops from Shehr to a point in the possession of the Nakfb of Mokalla. As this was clearly an infringement of the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870 the Resident detained the steamer at Aden when she came ’there to coal. The action of the Resident was confirmed by Govern- ment. . In April 1875, on security being given by the Kaitf agent in a sum of Rs. 25,000 that the steamer would not touch at Mokalla, Shehr or other neighbouring ports, nor take part in the operations between the belligerents, the Resident released the “ Pehlwan,” and his action was approved bv Government. J The Kaitf was reported in March 1874 to have applied for aid and support to the Governor General of Yemen but does not appear to have obtained any substantial assistance from that quarter. In November 1874 it was reported that the Kaitf was about to purchase the S. S. “ Phlox ” in Bombay, and despatch B 744-9130 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. it from Goa under Portuguese colours to Shehr ; but the Portu guese Government expressed their readiness to prevent its despatch. On the other hand, the Nakfb endeavoured to purchase the S. S. “Oorun,” but the negotiations fell through, as there was a disagreement as to the price to be paid. During 1874-75 hostilities continued with varying success, but gradually it became manifest that the Kaitf was the more powerful of the two chiefs. Local merchants and Arab traders suffered considerable inconvenience and losses from the acts of the contending parties, and the Jemadar of Shehr committed several acts of piracy against buggalows belonging to British-Indian subjects, because he suspected that they were bound to Mokalla. The Jemddar had declared a blockade of that port, but as it was wholly ineffective it could not be recognised. Captain Prideaux was despatched to Shehr with H. M, S. “ Vulture ” and the I. G. S. “ Kwangtung ” to call upon the Jemadar to make restitution. The Jemadar paid up Rs. 6,042 on account of the plunder of three buggalows “ Darya Dowlut/' “ Latka,” and “ Fath-al-Khair,” and both he and the Nakfb of Mokalla were warned against molesting buggalows, as their so-called blockades were ineffective and opposed to the law of nations. The Government of India were not prepared at this date to prevent hostilities by sea between the rival chiefs. In the beginning of 1875 the brig “ Sultan Basha n was supposed to be about to be sent from India to Shehr to assist against Mokalla, but Government could find no grounds for taking action. About the same time the Nakfb reported that an agent of the Kaitf had gone to Italy to purchase a steamer. Subsequently the Jemadar purchased at Genoa an old steamer, the “ Jawad,” and manned it with foreigners. The vessel found its way to Shehr; but as the Jemadar did not ration the European crew properly, the Commander brought her to Aden, where she was detained for a time, a breach of the Foreign Enlistment Act being anticipated. Eventually the steamer was allowed to proceed to Bombay on condition of not touching at Shehr. Supplies soon began to fail the Nakfb ; and the Kaitf in 1876 attacked the Kathfrf at Terfm, and also went against Ahl-Ghail, which he captured, the Kathfrfs having almost132 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. the Resident proceeding in person to mediate. He reported that Jemadar Niwaz Jung (who had not left for India as supposed) was very sore on the subject of Djs, and was averse to giving any written agreement to abide by the Resident’s arbitration, or to proceed further in the matter, until the question of Dfs was decided. The Kaitf furnished Major Hunter with a copy of the original agreement between himself and the late Nakfb, from which the complicity of the Nakib in ousting ’Alf Najf from Shehr was apparent. The Kaitf Jemadar added that, even after the question of Dfs was settled, his claim to 2,40,000 dollars under the agreement must be acknowledged by Government, and the payment thereof guaran teed. In fact, it was made apparent that the Kaitf was prepared to take by force what was refused on a peaceful demand. It was further ascertained that the Kaitf had concluded a ten- years’ truce with a chief of the Kathfrf whereby the latter, in consideration of the evacuation of Terfm, were not to approach nearer the coast than 70 miles, thereby effectually preventing them from aiding the Nakfb. During this year (1877) a quarrel occurred between the Nakfb and his brother Mohammed bin Salah, and Mr. Saleh Jaffer was sent in November to mediate between them. It was ascertained that the Nakfb’s brother had intrigued with the Kaitf; but the quarrel was patched up. In the beginning of 1878 Dfs, Sharma and Al-Karan were captured by the Kaitf, and the Resident informed the Nakfb that Government did not propose to intervene on the question of the ownership of Dfs, but only on the settlement of the money claims of the Jemddar. In February the Jemadar Niwaz Jung was permitted to visit Bombay and Hyderabad on certain conditions, the object of which was to sever finally his connection with Hyderabad, and the Resident’s visit to Shehr and Mokalla was accordingly postponed. In August the Resident wrote to the Kaitf advising him to prolong the truce and submit his desire for the Resident’s mediation in writing, no such request having been preferred to date. Meanwhile the Nakfb had written to the ’Imam of Muskat about his troubles, and the latter desired to mediate, but the Resident considered his intervention undesirable. The Kaitf continuing silent on the subject of seeking the Resident’s arbitration, the Resident suggested that it would bewm HISTORICAL RESUME' OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC. 133 advisable for Government to declare it the feud, but direct the Resident to parties to accept such a settlement recommend. would no longer tolerate step in and compel the as the Resident might q, , n N °j ei ?i )e 1 r S * eh the Native Assistant, visited T7&gt; f lr and Mokalla with a view to prolonging the truce until February, when the Resident hoped in person to visit those ports. I he Kaiti after much obstinacy eventually promised that no hostilities would commence until after Februarv pointmg out that his brother Niwaz Jung was still in India and that until his return no operations were likely. The Nakib adnutted the validity of the debt of 80,000 dollars, but ignored he alleged debt of 1,60,030 dollars, and had no objection to i.mding over a fourth of his revenues to repay the former . ebt ’ . ob J e T ct f d strongly to allowing any agent of the Kaiti to remain at Mokalla. ^ ^ &amp; On the 8th March authorized the Resident report— 1879 Government by telegram to visit Shehr, and inquire and (1) on the claim of 1,60,000 dollars ; (2) on the claim of 80,000 dollars ; (3) on the conditions on which both parties should have access to each other’s ports ; and (4) meanwhile to prevent any attempt at hostilities on either side. In the . same month Major Goodfellow, First Assistant Resident, visited Shehr and Mokalla, and obtained information trom both parties regarding their money claims. He suo-gest- ed the possibility of a middle course by which only Bandar Burum should be made over to the Kaiti on payment of another sum of not less than 80,000 dollars accompanied by the cancelment of the bond regarding the sale of half Mokalla and Burum. In the same month also it was reported by the Resident at Hyderabad that Barak Jung and Niwaz Jung had written to their brother Abdalla at Shehr, counselling him to continue at peace and abide by the Resident’s decision, subject to a right of appeal to Government, and in May the Resident in person visited Mokalla and Shehr and effected a truce for one vear from 7th May 1879. y In a letter of 96 paragraphs, dated 3rd June 1879, the Resident submitted to Government a resume of the wholeI 34 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. quarrel, and reported that the Nakib while admitting he had recovered 80,000 dollars held himself not bound by the eh t d of 1873, as he considered himself entitled to that sum for having spared the Jemadar s life when in his power. The Resident offered three draft agreements for the acceptance of the Naldb-Z, Y, and X, of which the Nakfb stated he would accept X if obliged to accept any. Agreement X was one which proposed the cancelment of the agreement of 1873 and the repayment of 80,000 dollars and 1,60,000 dollars undt 1 certain guarantees. Agreement Y proposed to cancel the bond of 1873, to repay 80,000 dollars, and cede Durum to the Kaitf. Agreement Z proposed to admit the validity of the bond of 1873, and to make the Kaitf half owner of Mokalla and Durum on payment of 1,60,000 dollars to the Nakfb. In the Resident’s opinion, two courses were possible—either to force the Nakfb to fulfil the agreement of 1873, or to annul the agreement on the ground of coercion, and cause the Nakfb to repay 2,40,000 dollars ; but he pointed out that the Nakfb objected to the first and the Jemddar to the second. In conclusion, the Resident suggested that on expiry of the truce Government should permit a renewal of hostilities by land, and whoever won should be acknowledged as victor. In June 1880 the acting Resident reported that, the truce having expired, the Nakfb had inquired whether Government w’ould take any further action in the dispute, and solicited further instructions for the Resident’s future guidance. Meanwhile the Nakfb continued to report that the Jemddar was making preparations for an attack, and the Kaitf intimated that he had closed the roads in the interior, but would report when he was actually marching against Mokalla. At length, in Government Resolution No. 5502, dated 13th November 1880, the Government of India, after reviewing the Resident’s exhaustive letter of 3rd June 1879, laid down— (1) that draft agreement X was a fair and reasonable compromise which both chiefs should be persuaded to accept without reserve; (2) that the Resident should decide the date from which interest should be payable under clause 2, and that Government would not object to interest being charged also under clause 3 of the draft agreement; (3) failing a satisfactory understanding, Government would intervene no further, but leave the chiefs to settle theirHISTORICAL RESUME' OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC. 135 quarrel as they pleased. If the terms proposed were accepted by one and refused by the other party, then Government was prepared to prevent war by sea ; (4) neither party was to be allowed to obtain assistance from India in men or material; (5) the Resident was to report the result of his com munications with the chiefs, and to be at liberty to make modifications. Any settlement freely accepted by both parties would be acceptable to the Government of India. 'In acknowledging this Resolution the Resident on 29th November solicited information— (1) as to whether Government would view with friendlv feelings the possession of Mokalla by the Turks, Italians, or French • (2) whether in the event of the Naki'b ceding Mokalla to the Kaitf, Government would authorize the Resident to guarantee a stipend to the Nakib; ( 3 ) whether, in the event of Mokalla being handed over to him, Government were prepared to form an offensive and defensive alliance w’ith the Kaitf Jemaddr; (4) whether, in the event of the Kaitf becoming half owner of Mokalla, Government would permit an European officer to be placed at Mokalla to look after its revenues, his salary being paid by both chiefs. The Resident after explaining why he asked these ques tions added that the Nakfb was still desirous of coming under the protectorate of Government, and was ready to give up one-sixth of his revenue, and that it remained for Government to decide whether such a protectorate was feasible. On the 2nd December the Resident telegraphed to Govern ment the capture of Burum and the necessity of a Government steamer at Aden to despatch to Mokalla to effect a truce for 20 days so as to enable British subjects to quit if necessary. The capture of Burum was effected by troops shipped in buggalows at Shehr and landed at Burum. Little resistance ■ was experienced. On the 6th December H. M. S. “ Philomel ” proceeded to Shehr and Mokalla with Mr. Saleh Jaffer, the Native Assistant, who was instructed to demand a truce and to warn British136 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. subjects, who chose to remain at Mokalla, that it was at their own risk. The Commander of the “ Philomel ” was requested to require the Kaitf to remove any war vessels to Shehr, and to inform both belligerents that Government would not tolerate any operations by sea. From the reports of the Commander of the “ Philomel ” and Mr. Saleh Jdffer it appeared that Burum was in the hands of the Kaitf, but that the Nakfb had no fear of Mokalla falling, as 1,500 Kathfrfs were marching to his aid. Both parties agreed to desist from operations by sea, and the merchants in Mokalla showed no* signs of fear. The Nakfb, relying on Kathfrf aid, was averse to a truce ; whereas the Kaitf, homing to seduce the Kathfrfs, was ready for a three-months’ truce. The Resident in reporti-ng the result of this mission recom mended acceptance of the Nakfb’s request fora protectorate, and the payment to him of a stipend of 500 dollars per mensem. While Government were considering their reply, the Nakfb continued to write to the Resident that, if his request were not acceded to, he must not be astonished should the Nakfb hand over his territory to the Kathfrfs, Turks, or Zanzibar, or a foreign power. Towards the end of December 1880 the Kaitf sustained a reverse at the hands of the Kathfrfs at Al-Tokhm, his Commander-in-Chief and 70 soldiers being killed, and on the 27th December the Resident despatched Mr. Sdleh Jdffer to aid the Commander of the “ Dagmar ” in enforcing abstention of hostilities by sea, to advise the Nakfb to temporize with the Kathfrfs until receipt of the reply of Government, to advise the Nakfb with Kathfrf aid to oust the Kaitf from Burum, and to permit British subjects to quit if so disposed. On the 6th January 1881 the “ Dagmar ” returned with 2 Kaitf buggalows that had persisted in contravening the orders as to hostilities by sea, and it became evident, from the reports of the Commander and Mr. Sdleh Jdffer, that only the presence of a man-of-war would ensure a cessation of hostilities by sea. On the same date the Resident despatched H. M. S. “ Seagull ” under Commander Byles to exercise an armed supervision of the coast and prevent maritime operations, to advise the Nakfb to wait for Government’s reply, and to allow the Kaitf garrison of Burum facilities to evacuate the place if necessary.HISTORICAL RESUME' OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC. 137 On the 10th January the Resident by telegram was autho rized to carry out the Government of India orders embodied in Government Resolution No. 5502, dated 13th Novem ber 1880 [vide paragraph 49 supra), but suspending the announcement of the final intentions of Government until receipt of the Resident’s report. Meanwhile the Nakfb was to be warned of the consequences of disposing of his country without the assent of Government. On the nth January, therefore, Captain Hunter, Assistant Resident, was despatched m the “ Dagmar,” and commissioned to submit for each belligerent s acceptance an agreement, corresponding with agreement X alluded to above, and to inform them that, if the agreement were not accepted, Government reserved its right of action in such a w r ay as might be decided. On the 16th January Captain Hunter returned, and re ported that the Nakfb accepted the agreement, but the Kaitf refused it on three gounds—(1) that some claims to his property and houses seized in Mokalla had not been settled, to which Captain Hunter objected that these had been ex pressly put aside by the Resident in 1878; (2) that Burum was now in his hands, and so the situation was altered, to which Captain Hunter objected that Burum had been seized by sea operations in defiance of Government orders ; and (3) that he must first consult his brothers. A truce of 15 days was effected, however, and the “ Seagull ” remained at Burum to watch affairs. Between 26th and 28th January Government authorized the cessation of hostilities by sea, and promised a further communication as to stopping hostilities by land also. On the 29th January the “ Dagmar ” was despatched to endeavour to prolong the truce for 15 days, and on the same date Government authorized the stoppage of hostilities by land. On the 5th January the “ Dagmar ” returned, the Jemadar only consenting to prolong the peace for nine days. At the commencement of February, in reply to an inquiry from Government, the Resident stated that, although the Kaitf had not proposed to accept British suzerainty, he w^ould probably not be averse to a subsidiary alliance. A strong letter was addressed to the Jemdddr, and on the 11th February Commander Byles intimated that he was willing to suspend operations until further notice. On 22nd February the Resident reported to Government that ’Abdul Habib bin Omar, cousin of the Governor of Shehr,138 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. had arrived with certain proposals, and was prepared to go to Shehr to induce the Kaitf to offer three l&amp;khs for Mokalla and Burum, or, failing this, to induce him to accept one of the 3 draft agreements, and as a guarantee offered to place Shehr and Mokalla (if ceded to him) under British suzerainty. Approving generally of this proposal the Resident sent ’Abdul H^bfb, accompanied by Mr. S&amp;leh Jdffer, to Shehr in the “ Dagmar ” on 23rd February, and the “ Dagmar ” returned on 3rd March. In reporting on this mission the Resident informed Government that both belligerents had signed the alternative agreements presented to them, but that the Nakib hoped Government would accept the offer of his country to the British, whereas the Jemddar hoped that sanction would be accorded to the sale of Mokalla and Burum to him. I he Resident inclined to the latter course. I he alternative agree ments referred to were :— (1) One by which half Mokalla and Burum were to become the Kaitf’s property, a British officer being appointed at Mokalla. (2) One by which the whole of Mokalla and Burum should be handed over to the Kaitf for 3,00,000 dollars. (3) One by which the deed of sale of 1873 was to be treated as void, and the Nakfb was to repay 80,000 dollars and 1,60,000 dollars to the Kaitf. The Jemaddr of Shehr further agreed (in the event of Mokalla becoming his) not to alienate Shehr and Mokalla to any foreign power without the consent of the British Government. After this the Kaitf garrison in Burum was relieved and taken to Shehr by the “ Seagull,” and the belligerents remained quiet in expectation of the orders of Government, and on the 16th March the “Dagmar” was sent with de spatches to Commander Byles, who returned in the “ Seagull ” to Aden. • Government having decided that the agreement No. 2 should be accepted, directed that a further agreement be taken from the Kaitf in regard to the money payments and subject to the approval of the Government of India. Captain Hunter, Assistant Resident, proceeded in H. M. S. “ Seagull ” on 15th April, and obtained the Kaitf’s signature to the agreement for payment of the moneys; but the Nakib was found toHISTORICAL RESUME OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC. 139 r ep udi a te the agreemcnC to sell Mokalla outright, and refused ° &lt; - ede Mokalla to the British Government, unless Government engaged not to hand it to the Kaitf.

The Resident therefore fetter to h Br d e^'-H d eh Ja ? er m the “ Da g mar ” to deliver a etter to the Kaiti urging him to proceed to the execution of he agreement without force if possible, and suggesting for his consideration the retention of Burum by the Nakib at a reduction of 80,000 dollars in the price to be paid At the same time the Commander of H. M. S. “Dragon” was de spatched with instructions to allow nothing to be landed at Moka la and Burum and to urge the Nakfb to allow the Kaitf peacefully to occupy Mokalla,—notices at the same time being published to all concerned that Mokalla and Burum had become the property of the Kaitf, and that no vessels w^ere to be brought into Mokalla or Burum. On the 11th Mav Government informed the Resident that his instructions authorized him to assist the Kaitf, and that the Nakfb should not be left in any doubt on this point, and that if the Nakfb only yielded to force, Burum need not be reserved to him. Mr. Sdleh Jaffer’s instructions were :— (1) To endeavour to induce the Nakfb to sign an agree ment to hand over Mokalla and Burum 'to the Kaitf in accordance with his previous agreement of 2 7ih February 1881. {2) Or to hand them over to the British Government. (3) Or to sell Mokalla, retaining Burum—80,000 dollars of the full price of 3 Idkhs being deducted. (4) In the event of the Nakfb handing over Mokalla peaceably, and the Jemdddr agreeing to Burum being140 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. retained by the Nakfb, to obtain the latter’s signature to an agreement wherein he should state his desire of becoming a stipendiary of the British Government. Mr. Saleh Jaffer was commissioned also to try and induce the Kaitf to obtain possession of Mokalla and Burum peacefully by winning over the people, and to inform the Naki'b that, if he resists the occupation of Mokalla by the Kaitf, Government will be at liberty to pay him nothing at all, and that he will not even be allowed to retain Burum if he yields to force only. The “ Dagmar ” returned to Aden on 21st May. The Nakfb refused all the agreements, and determined to oppose the Jemddar, who, it appeared, had no sufficient force available either to take Mokalla or Burum without the assistance of a man-of-war. The Resident in reporting this suggested the Kaitf should be assisted by the guns of the “ Dragon ” and be put in possession of Burum. On 22nd May a telegram informed the Resident that he was already instructed to assist the Jem&amp;ddr, but on 24th he was directed before employing force to report precisely the nature of assistance to be given. In his letter of 23rd May the Resident reported the results of Mr. Sdleh Jaffer’s mission, and that Commander Hulton (of H. M. S. “ Dragon ”) without waiting for Mr. Saleh Jdffer to ascertain whether the Jemadar was in a position to take Burum had precipitated matters by giving an ultimatum to the Nakfb and prematurely commencing a blockade. The Resident considered that the blockade being commenced should be continued till the Jemaddr was in possession of Burum, and he considered no attention need be paid to a petition of merchants protesting against Mokalla being handed over to the Kaitf. In a further telegram of 28th and letter of 30th May the Resident pointed out that the Kaitf had already paid in the first lakh of dollars, and that Government were, so to speak, responsible to him to have the agreement making him ruler of Mokalla carried out. He detailed the subterfuges employed by the Nakfb to evade all agreements except such as he him self might choose to act upon, and recommended the Kaitf be reinstated at Burum under the guns of a man-of-war. On the 14th June the Resident reported the return of H. M. S. “ Dragon ” and the impossibility of keeping up a blockade during the south-west monsoon. Meanwhile the Resident had addressed the Kathfrf Sultan with the object of detaching him from the Mokalla chief. On the 18th JuneHISTORICAL RESUME' OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC.

W , als , h returned on 30th June, and ascertained hat the Kaiti had about 500 men ready, but appeared indis- posed to move unless assisted by a man-of-war On the 5th July the Resident reported that the Kaitfs requests resolved themselves into four heads (1) Assistance to tow his armed bugralows from Shehr to Burum ; (2) The presence of a man-of-war atl Mokalla to prevent assistance reaching the Nakfb by sea; (d) ^ the British should call on Burum to surrender and hand it over to him ; (4) Permission to obtain men and material from India; and the Resident suggested-compliance with all but the 4th. In a letter dated 4th August the Kaitf refused to assent to the substitution of agreement No. 3 in lieu of No. 2 and he was again urged to consent. On the 13th August Mr. L. P. Walsh and a Residency official accompanied by ’Abdul Habib again went to Shehr to induce the Kaitf to accept the 3rd agree ment. The failure of these attempts were reported to Government on 22nd August, and the Resident added that, if Government were desirous of forcing No. 3 agreement on the Kaitf, it might be done by taking Mokalla and Burum under British protection. If, however, No. 3 agreement could not be enforced, the Resident suggested that the Kaitf be allowed a fixed time within which he might capture Burum, and after its expiry that the man-of-war be withdrawn. The Resident on 1st September was directed by telegram to press No. 3 agreement with greater insistance. Before resumption of the blockade the Kaitf was to be offered posses sion of Burum, on his general acceptance of No. 3 agreement, under the guns of a man-of-war, on the understanding, in case of refusal, that he would not be permitted to resume hostilities by sea. If he accepted, a Residency officer was to go to Mokalla and. intimate the substitution of the 3rd for the 2nd agreement. If the Mokalla chief demurred, then the blockade was to be resumed till the Kaitf had retaken Burum. The Resident pointed out that if the Kaitf refused to accept No. q agreement a long and desultory war would ensue, with an143 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. increased risk of Mokalla falling to a foreign power. Extracts from Arabic papers, showing the interest taken by Turkey in the affairs of Shehr and Mokalla, were quoted, and the advantages of allowing the Kaiti at once to attack by land and sea were pointed out. Meanwhile the Nakfb troops at Burum bred upon Com mander Hulton and his boats, and this was reported to Government. On the 17th September the Resident was directed to carry out his instructions already received, and on the 18th to send a Residency officer with Commander Hulton to inform the Nakfb that while Government were desirous of a modification of the terms, the treatment of Commander Hulton was a serious matter which would be the subject of a further communication. Accordingly on 24th September Mr. L. P. Walsh was despatched to inform the Nakib of the orders of Government, and to go to Shehr to obtain the Haiti’s acceptance of the 3rd agreement. H. M. S. “ Dragon ” accompanied the “ Dagmar.” On the 29th September Government informed the Resident that the position had altered, the Nakfb by an appeal for Turkish protection having forfeited sympathy. Agreement No. 3 was no longer to be pressed on the Kaitf, but he was to be put in possession of Burum, and left to attack Mokalla by land and sea for a period of not more than 6 months. H. M. S. “Arab” was then in port; but delay being experienced in obtaining Admiralty sanction to the use of the guns of the man-of-war, no action could be taken at once. Meanwhile on the 3rd October Mr. L. P. Walsh returned, and reported that the Nakfb had made satisfactory apologies to Commander Hulton, and had surrendered his commandant at Burum, ’Abdul Habfb, to the English. The Kaitf, he further reported, had declined to accede to agreement No. 3. In reporting the result of Mr. Walsh’s mission the Resident considered it desirable, before allowing the Kaitf to commence operations, that he should be made to promise a sufficient maintenance for the Nakfb. On the 5th October the Resident was instructed to use no force against Burum or Mokalla till further orders, and on the 6th the Resident reported that the Kaitf was quite prepared for hostilities by land and sea unaided. On the 18th and 19th the Resident reported that at the Nakfb’s request Mokalla had been placed by the Turkish authorities under the supervision of Sayyid Fadthl Mopla, and suggested a man-of-war should be stationed at Mokalla athistorical resume' of MOKALLA, SHEHR, etc. 143 once.

The Nakib pleaded that his subjects would not permit him to surrender. British subjects quitted Mokalla and Captain Hunter proceeded to Shehr, where the Kaitf signed two agreements (i) to remain submissive to Government; (2) to make provision for the Nakfb under any circumstances On the 30th 1,200 men left Shehr, and with the aid of the Dragon and “ Dagmar ” reached Burdin where Captain Hunter had an interview with the Kasddf Commander who refused to evacuate the place. On the is November under cover of a few shots from H. M S evacuating it T 1 ' ' tr0 ° PS e , ntered Bur6m ’ the Kasad ' evacuating it. Only 3 or 4 casualties occurred on the Nakfb’s side, and on the 2nd November Captain Hunter returned to tV d F n K fu Vln n g tbC J emdddr with 2,000 men to attack the Nakib with about 700. Captain Hunter desired Commander u ton to afford the Nakib and his personal attendants an asylum if demanded. 9 n the November the “ Dagmar ” was sent to com- municate with H. M. S. Dragon,’ 5 and on the i ith found the latter towing ten buggalows. It appeared that the Nakib had handed over the remaining forts one after another to Commander Hulton, and they were promptly occupied by the Jemadar, who on the 10th November was in full possession of Mokalla. Cholera had broken out in Mokalla and on board H. M.’s ships “Arab” and “Dragon.” The Nakfb and uaI 2 ’ 8 ° 0 r , folIowe /; s arrived at Aden in company with H M. S.. Dragon on 12th November. A portion of these subsequently returned to Mokalla; others went into the Lahej144 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. districts, while the ex-Nakfb with about i ,000 left Aden on 7th December for the Sawahil, promising not to land at Zanzibar except with the consent of the Sultan. On the 18th January 1882, however, he landed at Zanzibar, much to the annoyance of the Sultdn. The result of the above operations was the speedy and complete settlement of a troublesome business, and the Gov ernment of India decided to accept the situation. A treaty (copy of which is hereto annexed) was executed by the Jemadar of Shehr and Mokalla on 29th May 1882, which was ratified in July. Mr. L. P. Walsh and Mr. Sdleh Jaffer visited Shehr and Mokalla in January, and ascertained that the Kaitf had made no changes in the system of taxes, and that the Kathfris were harmless without the pecuniary aid of the ex-Nakib. The balance of the Idkh of dollars paid by the Kaitf after deducting the expenses of the ex-Nakfb and his followers whilst at Aden were invested, and the proceeds, amounting to Rs. 6,200 per annum, 'held in deposit for the ex-Nakfb’s maintenance. During 1883 the ex-Nakfb addressed several letters to the Resident desiring a reconsideration of his case, but was in formed that, Government having already decided the matter after full consideration, the Resident could not interfere. The ex-Nakfb was urged to accept his position, and make arrange ments for drawing the amount provided for his maintenance. The ex-Nakfb also addressed a memorial to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India, in reply to which he was informed that the Governor General had carefully considered his letter, but was unable to entertain his request for the restoration to him of Mokalla. In conveying this decision to the ex-Nakfb Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul General at Zanzibar was unable to persuade the ex-Nakfb to accept his position quietly, and reported that he had expressed an intention of settling at Lamo or Brava, and that he was in receipt of an income of a thousand dollars per mensem from His Highness the Sultdn of Zanzibar. During 1884 the ex-Nakfb still refused to draw the main tenance allowed to him. The Political Resident visited Mokalla and Shehr in the beginning of 1884, and friendly relations were firmly established with the Kaitf chief. The Resident visited Shehr and Mokalla in March 1885 an&lt; ^ again in October 1886.[ 45 HISTORICAL RESUME' OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC The most friendly relations and correspondence were main- 1887. tamed with the jemddar ’Abdalla bin tat H j u j\ j U , mar f s wel1 as with his brother’Awadth (at Hyderabad), and they both evinced a cordial desire to increase the intimacy existing with the British Government. At the end of September the Austrian Frigate ' Fasana ” paid a visit to the Kaitf’s ports, and the visitors were hospit ably entertained, as desired by the Political Resident in a letter of introduction to the chief. a Jemadar ’Adballa bin ’Umar died on the night of the 1888.

In 1896 a violent quarrel took place between the Sultdn’s 1896. nephews Husen and Manasar. The Resident who was visiting the coast b 744—10146 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. ports at the time was appealed to, but no settlement was reached. Manasar then went to Bombay, followed by Husen. They there quarrelled with Sultdn ’Awadth bin Omar over their claims to be considered in all respects equal to his sons. They returned to their country, followed in June by the Sultdn, who appointed his son Ghalib to the governorship of the state. The Sultdn’s two nephews w r ere given small allowances and having thus settled matters he returned to India. A dispute arose between the Kaitf and the Wdhidf over the ownership of Maifa’. The Kaitf blockaded the Wahidf ports. Even tually the matter was settled by the Kaitf buying Maifak The Kaitf defeated the Amudfs in a fight at Do’an. In February the Sultan returned from India and proceeded to Mecca on a pilgrimage, stating that if his nephews’ behaviour did not improve while he was away, he would adopt severe measures. He returned in June and in September the Resident visited Shehr and Mokalla and endeavoured to settle the differences between the Sultan and his nephews. Though the Sultan’s proposals were reasonable, his nephews refused to accept them and proceeded to India to lay their grievances before Govern ment. On their return in February 1902 a meeting took place at Aden between the Sultan and his nephews. The latter being still obdurate, the Sultan I90 , 2, returned to India. Manasar and Husen were allowed to return to Shehr on signing an agreement not to interfere with the taxes. This they failed to keep and in June the Resident accompanied by the Sultan went to Shehr with an armed force. Husen was brought back to Aden and Manasar shortly followed him. The settlement of the ac counts between the Sultan and his nephews was then left to the Mansab. In this year the Sultan’s old title of “Jemadar” was finally abolished. Sultan ’Awadth bin Omar attended the Darbar held at i 9 o 3 . Delhi on 1st January 1903. In 1904 the Mansab gave his decision, granting a large sum of money to Husen and Manasar and their families. They, however,HISTORICAL RESUME' OF MOKALLA, SHEHR, ETC. 147 refused to accept the Mansab’s award and in July left for India, the amount of the award remaining for the time being with Government. The Resident visited Mokalla. He remarked on the I9oi5 Governor’s success in inducing the Yafafs to submit to Military discipline and wear uniform. The Sultan purchased a share in the port of Balahaf from Sultan Saleh bin ’Abdalla the Wahidf, but Government refused to sanction the arrangement. The Sultan’s nephew Manasar, writing to inform the igo6 Resident of the death of his brother Husen, still refused to accept the decision of the Mansab, and endeavoured without success to re-open the question of their differences with the Sultan. Some fighting took place in December between certain Yafafs and Sidfs in Mokalla in which 5 persons were killed and wounded. The disturbance which arose out of a tribal quarrel was soon suppressed. Captain Mosse, Assistant Resident, visited Mokalla and i907 Shehr on the 4th and 5th January, the primary object of his visit was to arrange for payment of a sum of Rs. 37,000 for arms and equipment previously purchased from Government by the Sultan. Sultan Ghalib the Governor promised early pay ment. On the 10th April His Excellency Lord Lamington, the Governor of Bombay, paid a visit to Mokalla and held a Darbar there. He was the first Governor to do so. His Excellency was most hospitably entertained by Sultan Ghalib bin ’Awadth on his father’s behalf and valuable presents were exchanged. In June the Sultan remitted Rs. 15,000, a long delayed instalment on account of his debt to Government mentioned above. In June also Saleh bin Ghalib the ruling chief’s grandson passed through Aden on a visit to Europe, from which he returned^the following month. Hostilities broke out in August with the neighbouring Hamumf tribe, but no fighting of any real importance was reported.148 ARAB TRIBES IN THE VICINITY OF ADEN. Hadthramut is on the southern coast of Arabia, it is considered to be named from Hazarmauth one of the sons of Joktan. It is situated to the east of Yemen, “ the happy,” and its coast stretches some 600 or 700 miles onward to that of Oman. “ Phoenicians may not only have brought their language and their system of writing it but their idolatries, it seems, from Southern Arabia or Egypt. Mr. Furnal wishes to lay especial stress on the ethnological fact that from the very earliest ages Do’an and Hadthramut sent forth colonies on all sides to Asia, Africa, and even to Europe receiving none in return; the ancient tribe of “AD”, of which all Arabian tradition speaks, alone continuing to dwell within their own border. This tribe had for a prophet Habar, one of Abraham’s ancestors who gave his names to the Hebrews, and w r hom the Arabs call Hout At forty leagues from Zhafar there is a mountain called by inhabitants of Mareb, “ Nous,” near which is found, not the Kabr Houd, or tomb of Habar, but the Kabr Saleh, or tomb of the father of Habar.” “ The interest of research into the Himyaritic and Sinaitic inscriptions v r hich has hitherto been supposed to be confined to the learned, really rests, as it will now be perceived, in their relation to the British narrative. Are they, or are they not, the earliest remains of the family of Shem—the primaeval relics of Semitic language ? Is the inscription on the rock of Hisn Ghorab—coming to light afresh in 1834 A.D.—the same as that discovered by the Viceroy of Yemen, and translated into Mahomedan Arabic, 660 A.D. (about thirty years after the production of the Koran) ? Both documents are stated to consist of ten lines, and both are specified as found amid ruins in the Hadthramut. If identical, wdiere does Ad’s or Uz carry us but to the Book of Job, the only inspired Arabian record, and to the Sabeans, of that patriarch’s day ? Did he not speak of enduring engraving on a rock ? And judging from the tenor of Schultans’ Arabic translation of their rock, does it or does it not speak words kindred to Job’s Sublimest utterances ? ” The tribe of Aud were descended from Ad, the son of Aws, the son of Aram, the son of Shem, the s*m of Noah who, after the confusions of tongues, settled in U 1 Akkaf, or the Winding Sands, in the province of Hadthramut, where his posterity greatly multiplied.Behan al Kasab. Iiehan al Kasab is an independent country bounded on the north by the country of Harib, on the west by Jerabat a district of Karn, on the east by a desert tract called Bal Hanth, and on the south by Al-Malajim and Behan Ad-Dowlah (under Beda). It was not till 1903 that any intercourse took place with 1903. the chief of Behan. In that year fearing I urkish aggression Sharif Ahmed Am Mohsin came into Aden and signed a treaty by which he was granted a monthly stipend of 30 dollars. I he Sharif sent a live specimen of that somewhat rare 1905. animal the Arabian Oryx as a present to the Resident. Government sanctioned a present to the Sharif of 6 M. H. 1906. rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition. The Sharif visited Aden in August and asked to be given a British flag; it was not thought necessary to grant his request. Kadthi Atik bin Ahmed of Behan paid a visit to San’a, and was informed that the Resident was not altogether pleased at his doing so. 1907. Sharif Ahmed Am Mohsin visited Aden in February.The ’Audair The ’Audalf country is of considerable extent and lies between the Fadthli on the south, J Aulakf on the east and Yafaf on the west. The Sultan made overtures to the Residency for 1 reaty Relations in 1902 but he was not at the time considered of sufficient im portance for these to be encouraged. These were followed by a period during which the tribe was excluded from Aden owing to their supposed connection with an attack made on a British Survey party (in 1903) along with the Ahl Am Saidi of Dathina. The ’Audalf again made overtures for a treaty, which his position on the trade routes and the efforts of Turkish intrigue seemed to render desirable. In January a recommendation was made to Government that the ’Audalf overtures for a treaty should be given favourable considera tion. A deputation from the Shaikh of the Ahl As-Shaar a division of the ’Audalf came in March and wished to make an agreement with Government. They were told that they could not be recognised as independent of their Sultan Kasim bin Ahmed. Sayad Mahomed A 1 Hadad in April visited Aden with a letter from the ’Audalf Sultan, asking for a definite answer to his treaty overtures and confirming the reports that had been received of advances made to one of the ’Audalf chiefs by the Turks. Government was again addressed upon the subject.TREATIES AND ENGAGEMENTS. 1 59 No. Nature.

STEVENS, Lieutenant-Colonel, Commandant, Aden Troop.34° APPENDIX E. Chiefs and other individuals of importance in the Aden Hinterland having relations with the Aden Residency (1907). (/) Abdalla ha I mad (Matarafi-Subehi). A petty Shaikh of the Matarafi section of the Subehi tribe. Aged about 50 years. He resides at a village called Mulchia in Wadi Dar near Jabal Khubati on the Turkish border. He has some influence over his clan which consists of nomads. He visited Aden for the second time during 1906. [2) Abdul Karim bin,Fadthl (’Abdali). Eldest son of the late’Abdali Sultan Fadthl bin ’AH. He is fairly well educated in Arabic. He knows no English.

Aged about 30 years. He succeeded his nephew Sultan Bubakr bin Sef in January 1899. He is a stipendiary and draws a stipend of dollars 610 a year. His relations with the Residency have not been satisfactory during past few years since he last visited Aden in June 1902 and took offence at restrictions imposed upon the members of his following. He is said to be unpopular with his relatives and others of his tribe who do not approve of his present attitude of sullen indifference towards the Residency. He is also said to be somewhat weak in intellect. [4) Abdulla Husen [Fadthli). Son of Husen Ahmed the Sultdn of the Fadthlf tribe. Aged 23 years. Nothing much is known of him. (5) Abdul Majid Fadthl {’Abdali). Younger brother of Sir Ahmed Fadthl the Sultan of the \AbdaH tribe. Aged 45 years. He commands the ’Abdalf forces on import ant occasions and takes a general share in the administration of the State, and is to some extent consulted by the Sultan in matters of importance. He is said to be a candidate for the Sultdnate upon the death of the present ruler of the ’Abdalf. (6) Abdur Rahman bin Kasim, Shaikh [Upper Yafai). Chief of the important clan of the Muflahf. A well-wisher of ours and friend to Sultdn Kahtan in whose rehabilitation he has busied himself much. Lives at A 1 Jurba. A stipendiary.%#!&gt;Zi%02%(', NOTABLE PERSONAGES IN THE ADEN PROTECTORATE. 341 (7) Abdur Razzak bin Abdul Rahman, Saiyid {’Amiri). An influential man from J. Harir. His title is “ Abu Shamla.” Has proved invaluable in settling the ’Amin-Shairi differences. A man of considerable Koranic lore. (&lt;?) Ahmed Am Ba’sus {Wahasha-Subehi). Joint Shaikh of the Ma'mai, a section of the Wahasha division of the Subehi tribe. Aged about 50 years. Lives at Am Shairaija. Relations with the Residency satisfactory on the whole. Has visited Aden frequently of late years. Non-stipendiary. (p) Ahmed Am Mohsin [Behan-al-Kasab). Sharif of Behan-al-Kasab. Aged about 47. He concluded a Protectorate Treaty with Government in December 1903. He receives a stipend of dollars 480 a year. He is a man of some character and well disposed towards the British Government. He professes anxiety to extend the British sphere of influence in a north ward direction over Beda, Mareb and A 1 Jauf. (/o) Ahmed bin Awadth Badas {’Irka). Shaikh of Trka on the East Coast of the Aden Protectorate. Aged about 50 years. A stipendiary. In 1901 his stipend was raised from . dollars 80 to dollars 180 per annum. One of his ancestors was popularly regarded as a saint and worshipped accordingly, to which fact this Shaikh owes his position and possessions. He is illiterate and unenlightened but friendly. He visits Aden about once a year only to pay his respects to the Political Resident and to receive his stipend and a present. (//) Ahmed bin Fadthl bin ’AH {’Abdali). Second son of the late ’Abdali Sultan Fadthl bin ^Ali. Aged about 19 years. He is fairly well educated and knows a little English. He accompanied the ’Abdali Sultdn Sir Ahmed Fadthl to Delhi in 1902.

Sultan of the Wahidis of Bir ’AIL Aged about 55 years. He concluded a treaty with Government in 1888 which was renewed in 1896. He receives a stipend of dollars 360 a year. His relations with the Residency are satisfactory. . He is a pleasant and intelligent chief Some time ago he parted with certain of his lands to the Sultan of the Kaiti ; with whom his relations are intimate. Goes in for trade a good deal. Owing to his efforts, the importance of Bir ’AH as a port is growing.342 APPENDIX E. (ij) Ahmed bin Saleh, the Wdhidi (Bdlahdf). One of the Wahidi share-holders of the Port of Balahaf on the East Coast of the Protectorate. Elder brother of Sultan Mohsin bin S&amp;leh. Aged about 35 years.

Sultan of the ’Abdali tribe, succeeded to the Sultanate on the 29th April 1898. Aged about 50 years. Receives a stipend of 1,641 dollars a month and is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. An astute and capable ruler. He visited India in 1902 and attended the Darbar at Delhi in January 1903. His relations with Government are on the whole good. But he suffers from a sense of disappointment at not being supported in a position of supremacy over the Subehl tribes. He is of an ambitious and somewhat jealous disposition and anxious to occupy a position of supremacy amongst the rulers of the Hinterland and as far as possible the position of sole intermediary between them and Government in all affairs—a position which was in former days comparatively convenient but is now, with the continued develop ment of the Hinterland and the establishment of more intimate and direct relations with other rulers, somewhat less so. He covets .wealth as well as power and would probably favour any scheme calculated to increase either. He derives a large revenue from transit and other dues on caravans passing to and from Aden. His interests are closely connected with those of Aden. (75) Ahmed Muthanna, Shaikh ('Amiri). Shaikh of A 1 Beshi of the Shairi tribe. Perhaps the best friend of the 'Amir amongst the Shairls. His former tribal influence has passed to Shaikh Salim Sdleh. Has a custom house at A 1 Khoraiba at foot of Pass of that name. (16) Ahmed Said (Jurabi-Subehi). Mansab of the Wall Sanawi shrine on the Anglo-Turkish border of the Subehl-Humedl boundary. Aged about 40 years. He is revered by the Jurabl secti n of the Subehl tribe as a man of consi derable sanctity. He resides in the village of Habil-as-Sabt*or Sanawi in the Wadi Maadin on the Humedl-Jurabl border. He rendered useful services to the Boundary Commission and has recently visited Aden. He is a man of some intelligence. In the character of a news correspondent has been of service latterly. (ij) ’Alawi bin 1 Ali (Buremi-Subehi). Chief Shaikh of the Bureml division of the Subehl tribe. Age 37 years. Lives at Mujaba. His father was a troublesome individual^hih^hhhhhhhhhhshhhbhhhhhi NOTABLE PERSONAGES IN THE ADEN PROTECTORATE. 343 but of recent years the Buremfs have given little trouble. Recently, however, several petty Shaikhs, who have hitherto been considered Buremis, have asserted their independence with a view to obtaining separate presents for themselves from Government. The fact that 'Alawf bin ’AH supports their contention is an indication of his weakness. (/£) ’Ali Abdul Karim [or Ubadi) (Juban), Shaikh. Fierce hater of the Turks and extremely annoyed because of his inclusion on the Turkish side of the border. Juban, Nawa, Rubieten and Bani Dthabiani form a coterie in offensive and defensive league with Upper Yafa. Constant professor of friendship with British Government. (/p) 'Alt bin 'All Azzindani, Shaikh ('Amiri). A scion of a once important house during the Turkish regime on J. Jihaf. Now a fast friend of ours, though others of his house stand aloof. Lives at Sarir the former Turkish head-quarters. (20) ’Ali ba Haidara (^Akrabi). Brother of the late ’Akrabf Shaikh and uncle of the present Shaikh of the ’Akrabi tribe, Shaikh Fadthl bin Abdulla. A shrewd old man of about 60 years of age who pressed his claim to succeed to the chiefship upon his brother's death in March 1905 with some insistance. The 'Akrabi tribe preferred to elect Shaikh Fadthl bin Abdulla. (21) 'Ali Askar, Shaikh (Upper Yafai). He, with Mohsin Askar his brother, represents the Ahl Nakib of the Mausatta clan. They are styled “ Fathers of Yafa Unfor tunately not on good terms with Sultan Kahtan. Are well-disposed towards us. Have relations with Hyderabad (Deccan). Are sti- pendiaries. (22) 'Ali ba Saleh ba Rageh (Atifi-Subehi). Shaikh of the Awaidtha section of the Atifi division of the Sube- his. Age 37. Lives at Khatabia or Karyat al Kadthi, but the Atifis, a clan of nomadic robbers, are always on the move. This Shaikh draws a stipend of Rs. 3° P- jointly with Said ba Ali the Atifi of Turan. At present his relations with the Residency are not satis factory owing to his unwillingness or inability to surrender some members of his clan who murdered a postal runner and looted the Government mails within British limits in January 1906. His stipend has been withheld pending compliance with our demands. I his has partly been the cause o\ recent dissensions among his adherents, some of whom have left him and joined Said ba All. Personally this Shaikh is weak and unable, even if he had the will, to control his unruly following. He succeeded his brother Ahmed ba Saleh in July 1905.344 APPENDIX E. (2j) 'AH ba Salim {Humedi-Subehi). A petty Shaikh of the Humedf section of the Subehf tribe. Aged about 55 years. He resides at Jabal Asharwan near the Haush- abi border. His clan are mainly nomads. His relations with the Aden Residency have been so far confined to one visit paid to Aden. He is said to exercise considerable influence over his clan, which, originally subject to the Makhdumf is now quite independent. { 2 4 ) 'AH bin Abdulla bin Salim bin Afrir {Kishn and Socotra). Sultan of Kishn and Socotra. Aged about 75 years. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns and draws a stipend of dollars 480 a year. His relations with the Residency are satisfactory, but he is now too weak and old to visit Aden. He sends his adviser Sayad Salim to Aden once a year to collect his stipend. He belongs to the Mahan tribe. ( 2 S) ’AH bin Ahmed am Tommi ( Burhimi-Subehi). A Shaikh of the Burhimf clan of the Subehf tribe. Aged 40 years. Has considerable influence over his tribesmen and is a man of quiet disposition. He draws a stipend of dollars 300 a year, on the strength of a Protectorate Agreement entered into on the 21st September 1889. During 1906 a dhow was looted on the Burhimf coast from his failure as yet to make reparation demanded it seems that his control over his people is not as great as had been believed. His stipend is at present suspended in consequence. (26) 'AH bin Ahmed bin 'AH {'Abdali). Cousin of Sir Ahmed Fadthl, Sultan of the 'Abdalf tribe. Aged 40 years. He is to some extent consulted in State affairs. He is said to be a candidate for the chiefship upon the death of the present ruler. (27) 'Alt bin Ahmed Fadthl {’Abdali). Eldest son of Sir Ahmed Fadthl, ruling Sultan of the r Abdalf tribe. Aged about 25 years. He has been fairly well educated in Arabic at Lahej, the chief town of his father’s territories. He has no know ledge of the English language. He assists his father in the man agement of his affairs, and particularly in the cultivation of his private ands. He is anxious to have a share in any railway that may pass through Abdalf territory, and is a man of business generally. (2S) 'Ah bin Mam Sultan {Haushabi). Sultan and stipendiary of the Haushabf tribe. Just after his e ection he was much in the hands of irresponsible advisers and showed signs of weakness and irresolution. Had the misfortune o ia\ ing the bad example of his infamous uncle, deceased, the l.'tc laushabi Sultdn. Has however much improved and is begin-PH NOTABLE PERSONAGES IN THE ADEN PROTECTORATE. 345 tiing to exercise authority over his tribesmen. Has a very extensive domain traversed by seven trade routes. Loyal to the British ■ Government. (29) } Ali bin Mohsin Askar [Upper Yafai). One of the Askar family in Upper Yafa. These are styled “ Nakibs ” and also “ Fathers of Yafa.” Liberally treated by the late Boundary Commissioners, he still expects, under the change of circumstances, a continuance of Government largesses on the same lavish scale. Has been chosen as intermediary in affairs Yafai. Has a small, if influential, following. Is the quintessence of pride, vanity and avarice. A typical Upper Yafai. (30) 'Ali bin Nashir bin Saif [ } A lately Chief of the small but loyal ’Alawi tribe whom he has well in hand, in spite of the chronic disputes with the Kotaibis ; a middle- aged man of no great influence otherwise, formerly loyal and amen able to advice, latterly his hatred and jealousy of the Kotaibi, combined with excessive indulgence in “ K.at have led him into difficulties. At present he draws a stipend of Rs. 300 a year. He succeeded to the chiefship in 1898. (j/) ’All Bughail [Jurabi-Subehi). An Akil of the Jurabi division of the Subebi tribe, chief of the Bughaili section. About 36 years of age. Resides at A 1 Gharika. His father was recognised as chief of the whole Jurabi section, but the son’s influence does not extend much beyond his own section. His relations with the Residency have fairly been satisfactory but in December 1906 became somewhat strained owing to a difference of opinion regarding a present offered to him. He is inclined to be cantankerous. [32) ’All Mani as Sakladi, Shaikh [Shaibi). An amicable man, but only nommal head (Marad) of the Shaibl tribe who are considered to be an appanage of the Mausatta clan in Upper Yafa. The Sakalida are composed of many sections, each a law to itself. A stipendiary. (^3) ) All Mohsin Askar, Shaikh [Upper Yafa).

Receives a stipend of 360 dollars a year and is entitled to a salute of 12 guns. The most enlightened chief of the Aden Hinterland. He is possessed of considerable wealth. He resides for the most part himself at Hyderabad where he holds the titles of Sultan Nawazjung Shamshid-ul-Mulk and Shamshid-ud- Doula. His sons do most of the administrative work of his State. This chief, who obtained his present position by gradual conquest of territory with the assistance of mercenary troops from India, is anxious to still further aggrandize his position and territories at the cost of his neighbours. He has succeeded for instance in the Wahid! territory in securing valuable possessions from the Sultan of B!r ’Al! but he has recently received a check at Balahaf and is now to be informed that he must not allow his ambition to interfere with the peace of the country. He is a loyal friend of Government and a courteous and enlightened gentleman. (jy) Awwas bin Tahir, Shaikh ('Amiri). Chief of the Ahmed! clan on the reaches of the R. Tiban. On good terms with the Am!r, and of use to him in that part of the country but lately won over to the 'Amir’s cause. (j8) Darwish Batash (Dubeni-Subehi).

He recently endeavoured to part with his share of the Port of Balahaf to the Kaiti Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, which has been negatived by Government and which has led to his deposition in favour of Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh. Has quarrelled with the latter regarding his share of the port dues of Balahaf, and refuses to have the matter settled by the arbitration of the Syeds.

Somewhat eccentric but very friendly and a personality to be remembered in that part of the countrv. A despiser of the Turks and their methods. (&lt; 9 y) Salim Saleh Al Bakam (Shaikh 'Amiri). Marad (or chief) of the important Shairf tribe. I believe him to be a thoroughly honest man and well able to lead the tribesmen who derive importance from their position between Dthdla and the Turkish frontier. These people have for years been at variance with the Amir. Turkish occupation of their country for 30 years has made them, an extremely difficult tribe to win over to ^their suzerain the 'Amir. Three years has effected but a slight change, but I am fully optimistic. Al Malaha is the Shairi head-quarters. (88) Sef Ahmed (Behan-al-Kasab). Shaikh of the Musabain tribe of Behan-al-Kasab.
