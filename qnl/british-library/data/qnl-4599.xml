On basis of this 1,500,000 cigarettes (gross) will weigh 7200 Lbs. or roughly 3^ tons; and hence the details of my applications in question tally right. Yours faithfully.A- D.O.No THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN: 23rd September, 194-3 • &gt; ^ /s' Reference attached herev/ith returned A' v Taking cigarettes as dead weight cargo, as you have requested, 600,000 cigarettes per month will weigh 1 &amp; 1/3 tons, or 4 tons per quarter ' I am, however, not satisfied with this figure as I have made a very careful check of the manifest of s• s.'GEORGE E PICKRTT’ 1 per which vessel we have received a large quantity of cigarettes, and although the weight is also shown in the manifest, freight is in every case payable on the measurement basis, and this basis confirms the correctness of our estimate of 5 tons per month.

He sought their opinion with regard to percentage profit to be made on motor tyres and tubes, motor cycle tyres and tubes, bicycle tyros and tubes, and electrical batteries of six volts or more. The Political Agent decided that 40 per cent was reasonable profit for all typos- of tyros ana that owing to flosses due to breakage etc e , cm consignments of batteries it would be very difficult to lay down any fixed percentage on this typo of iu-oortsc It was decided that the percentage profit would bo fixed for each consignment by the Customs Department in consultation with the Political Agent V.

The President stated that the principle governing •tho export of all goods from Bahrain was that only goods surplus to the requirements of the local population could be export d. Intending exporters should make applications to the Director of Customs who would certify whether or not in his opinion the goods wore in fact surplus and that application would then be presented to the Political Agent who ' ould base his decision with regard to export on the recommendation of tho Director of Customs.

' -i • y MKMOnAJfbUM Owing to the grant by the Government of India of a quota of five million cigarettes a month axid the necessity to ‘economise shipping space from the United Kingdom applications from merchants for permission to import cigarettes from the United Kingdom are not being considered by me. This means that the import of all cigarettes other than American has been diverted into the hands of Messrs. Abdulla Aujan &amp; Bros., who are your agents in Bahrain. Prior to this 78% of the imports of British and Egyptian cigarettes was in the hands of Messrs. Aodullah Aujan &amp; Bros., and 22 % was divided among certain other importers in the town. It is in my opinion undesirable that through the exigencies of the war any one merchant should become a monopolist and profit propose to insist upon Messrs. Abdulla Aujan &amp; Bros., handing over at cost price 22 % of all imports of cigarettes to the Director of Customs for distribution among those merchants who in normal circumstances wbuld have importel irom the United by the state of affairs which through no effort on his part has diverted trade from his competitors to him and I therefore Kingdom ft (J)t Political Agent, Bahrain. 4r /Cable Address:- MODERNSTUDIO' BAHRAIN * % t, \ % ^ &gt;7 THE MODERN ART STUDIO Distributor of Westinghouse Products MURAD tributor of N. -\ / WgST IlifiHOUSE \ #r BAHRAIN, Bahrain Islands Codes:&gt; A.

The Director of Customs, having seen to the stock condition in Bahrain 2 *ecommends the application if in his opinion the import is justified. On this, the Agency recommends for shipping space. 3.

Further to our letter of the 5th instant, we have just received a communication from the Board of Trade with reference to the question of cigarette supplies for the Kiddle East Territories from which it would appear that there would be no official objections at this end to such exports provided that only modest quantities, at the present time, are supplied. Exports are, however, to be conditional on importers having obtained official permission to place orders, hence it will be necessary for you to furnish us with the reference number or other moans of identification of local import license secured from your local authorities.
