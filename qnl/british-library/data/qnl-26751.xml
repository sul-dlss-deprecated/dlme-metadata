Wt 34001/249 .10,000 With reference to Foreign Office letter No.F.4070/4070/61 dated 2nd May 1938, on the subject of the supply of arms to Nepal, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that on reconsideration he does not consider it necessary to pursue the question of the insertion of Nepal in the priority list of foreign countries to whom war material may be supplied by this country. It is anticipated that the Government of India will be in a position to supply the bulk of Nepal’s future requirements of war material as in the past, that any ; additional requests of the Nepalese Government for the supply of up-to- date war equipment from the U.K. are likely to be extremely small and that such requests can be dealt with by the priority Committee on their merits without including Nepal on the priority lis t. In this connection I am directed to state, for the information of Lord Halifax, that apart from the very close and friendly relations o f the Nepalese Government with H.M.G. and the Government of India,the chief 6837 reason/reason for treating Nepal with special consideration in the matter of the provision of war material is that Nepal supplies large numbers of troops to the Indian Army in time of peace and is a potential ally tfjr H.M.G. in case of war. A copy of this letter is being sent to the War Office.

Office Weekly Letter Do.47 of the 25th November 1937) concerning an enquiry received by Messrs.Vickers Armstrong Ltd., from the Military Attache to the Nepalese Legation for the supply of 50 Mark III Vickers Berthier guns ? We now understand (vide correspondence ending with India Office letter Do.M.3359/38/0.S.37 of the 17th May addressed to the Government of India, Defence Department) that Messrs.Vickers Armstrong have given their consent to the manufacture in the Indian Ordnance Factories of the 50 guns required by Nepal and the way is therefore clear to explain the position to the Nepalese Government (either through their Military Attache' in London or our Minister at / Sir A.Metcalfe, K.C.I.E. , C.S.I. , M.V.0. , External Affairs Department, Government of India. Tat Katmandu); but before this is done v/e should like to have confirmation of the fact that the Government of India will be in a position to supply the guns during 1940 (see Defence Department letter No. 42100-1 (S.D.2) of the 26th January 1933 addressed to the Military Secretary, India Office). Would you kindly have enquiries made on the point and let us I enow the result in due course? I am sending a copy of this letter to Netham at Katmandu. Yours sineerely* (Sad.) R. PtELIn any further communication on this subject, please quote k No. p 4070/4070/61 and address— not to any person by name but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,’’ Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 'CONFIDSNTIAL- Sir, (M 1 C Foreign Office. S.W.l. 2nd May, 1938. ' ^ Wrup With reference to India Office communication to this department No. P.2.1454/38, of the 13th April, regarding the supply of arms to Nepal, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state that he notes that the India Office propose to suggest the insertion of Nepal between No. 7 and No. 8 on the priority list of foreign countries to whom war material may be supplied by this country. 2, Lord Halifax is in some considerable doubt as to the extent to which Nepal can be regarded as requiring arms: her geographical position is one which seems to lend itself only to an insignificant degree to the dangers of external aggression and her real arms requirements must presumably be limited to A those needed for the maintenance of internal order. For this she will not require heavy types of arms or- the latest models. Nor does it seem probable that she will prove a profitable market for arms of those kinds which may be useful to her. 3. Although it is improbable in present circumstances that any countries placed lower than No. 6 on the priority list will actually receive any important supplies of arms from this country, there are a number of reasons, both political and commercial, for meeting, where possible, the requirements of for instance Yugoslavia, Greece, the Baltic States, China or Iran, which are Nos. 8, 9, 13-15, 18 and 19 on the list respectively. The Under-Secretary of State, itoTSC* 5 ^! - MAY 1336 1NPIA OFFIC E ■X t - vrespectively. In the light of paragraph 2 above, however, there would appear to be no reasons of comparable cogency for supplying Nepal with arms from this country. 4. Lord Halifax therefore inclines to the view that, unless it can be shown that the Government of India are under some sort of treaty obligation to treat Nepal with special consideration in the matter of supplying her with arms, it would be undesirable to place her as high as No. 8 on the priority list. If it is considered politically desirable that some weapons, however inferior in quality, be supplied to her, a place could be found for her lov/er down on the list, in virtue of which such arms might be supplied to her without interfering with the requirements of other countries whose needs on political grounds are regarded as greater. It is, however, desirable that the India Office and Foreign Office should reach agreement as to what place the War Office should be asked to accord to Nepal on the priority list and I am to suggest that the India Office might perhaps prepare a considered statement showing exactly how important in their opinion it is to facilitate the purchase of arms in this country by Nepal. In this connexion it should be borne in mind that the priority list referred to is a purely unofficial list for the guidance of His Majesty’s Government and has no relation to the prestige of the countries to which it refers. 5. As the Air Ministry are understood also to have adopted this priority list, I am to suggest that they may be informed of any revision which is eventually made in it. 6. A copy of this letter is being sent to the War Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,P.Z.1454/38. Minute Paper. CVVw political Department. V^7}, Military Secretery , Please see l!ajor Cawthorn’s letter of the 2nd March to Mr.Symon re^ardinf^ an enquiry which the War Office have received from Messrs.Keymer on behalf of the Nepalese Government for a detailed quotation for two anti-aircraft guns which Messrs.Vickers say they would be unable to supply probably until about 1940/41 without * interfering with the British re-armament programme. I : understand that the War Office have now received further enquiries of a similar nature from Messrs.Keymer, and they would like to have our views on the question from the political point of view. 2. It is obviously desirable politically that the Nepalese should purchase their requirements of war material in this country or in India rather than from foreign sources, and we sha-14 do all that we reasonably can to meet their needs, but we could not, I think, press . for special priority treatment for Nepal, where this is in conflict with the needs of our own re-armament programme. If we are unable to supply the Nepalese they might perhaps have recourse to foreign sources of supply, but this is a risk which we can no doubt face in the last resort. On the other hand I suppose there are military advantages in having the Nepalese Army armed with more or less the same weapons as the Army in India. From their own point of view the Nepalese would probably continue to purchase the standard weapons which they really require for their Army from British sources, especially since all their supplies have to pass through India. The requests which we are considering now are for 'luxury' equipment, presumably for experimental purposes. H474B Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP 3./ /Dear Further to our telephone conversation regarding A.A. guns for Nepal, the following is a summary of the position to date In November 1937 Vickers informed the War Office that Messrs. Keymer had asked, on behalf of the Nepalese Minister in London, for a detailed quotation for two A.A. guns complete with accessories and ammunition, the guns to be of between 40 and 75 mm. calibre. Vickers stated to the War Office that they could not undertake the order at present without interfering with the British rearmament programme, and asked for guidance as to the answer they should give. After some correspondence, it is most unlikely that Vickers could offer supply, without this interference, before the financial year 1940/41 at the earliest. _ 2. You asked whether Nepal was on the priority list of ^ foreign countries for the supply of war material. She does Cr£&amp;0\not appear on the list which was drawn up by the Foreign /jk / Off ice and agreed to by thfe War Office. 3. From the War Office point of view, taking into account our own programme and the demands of certain other countries to which we have obligations, such as Egypt, Iraq and Portugal, it would be advisable to postpone the Nepal order as long as possible without actually ’’killing” it. 4. It is most unlikely that Nepal could be provided with A.A. guns from W.D. stocks before the middle of 1940, if then. Acceptance by Nepal of new guns of British service pattern would not be likely to lead to earlier supply, it might well mean greater delay. A.C.B. Symon, Esq., India Office.

The following message for the Prime Minister begins; During the recent discussions between the British Military Mission now in Portugal and the Portuguese authorities (aa to which see despatches of 4th November and 13th November from Lisbon enclosed among Foreign Office prints sent on 23rd December and 26th January respectively and despatch of 1st December to Berlin enclosed among Foreign Office prints sent 16th December) question arose of Portuguese orders for armaments being placed in this country. Unless we were able to give some assurance regarding delivery IherQ were grounds for fearing that Portugal might turn to Germany for the greater part of her rearmament requirements, whereas if such requirements wore met from this country it would* v© felt, be of great value, since this would have the advantage that in the event of emergency Portuguese armaments would be similar to our own. In the present circumstances, before deliveries to Portugal from this country would be possible a considerable time must necessarily elapse and in the circumstances, Portuguese were desirous of obtaining from us some assurance for assistance, during the interim period, in the event of emergency. The following general considerations have been taken into account in examination of the question. We have reason to suppose that whatever the outcome of the Civil War British interests in Spain may suffer seriouslyseriously and in the present international situation it is important that we should do everything that wo can to strengthen our position in relation to the Iberian Peninsula* We are also informed that the Portuguese Government are anxious about their future relations with Spain* v/e feel, therefore, that there is every advantage # in making it- clear that we are anxious to strengthen our ties with Portugal whatever the final result of Civil War in Spain may be* This is particularly necessary p we feel, in view of the increasing efforts on -the part of other countries to play a predominant part in Portuguese affairs* We are proposing in the circumstances to exchange notes with the Portuguese Government, the substance of which is contained in my immediately succeeding telegram* Tt will be observed that the assurance in the latter part of the United Kingdom note is in reaffirmation of long standing treaty obligations to which, it will be remembered, the Prime Minister referred in his speech of the 24th March (see my telegram Circular B« ho,81), Draft of notes in this sense are being discussed with the Portuguese Government* Message endscCIRCULAHo PAJRAPHRA.BE TEXaSOEAM, 938 i To the Governments of Canada ?

Clauson, Esq., India Office, S.W.l.Colonel Dennys, Colonel A^kerman^ and Mr. Lambert of the War Office came over on March 1st to discuss the question of the supply of arms to Iraq by the Government of India. Mr. Walton presided and Colonel Barstow and Colonel Crofton were present. The War Office explained that the Iraqi Government were at present urgently requiring certain guns which are no longer manufactured in this country but are manufactured by the Government of India in their Ordnance factories. The Government of India were prepared to execute the Iraqi Government’s present order as sub-contractors for the War Office, but they wished for a guarantee to cover the transaction. Mr. Lambert said that the terms on which the War U. '/C, forif/J c*~ AnL * Office carry tat out orders of this for the Iraqi Government are that the Iraqi Government pays for the work as it is done by means of quarterly , and that there is accordingly no question of credit being given to the Iraqis. Mr. Walton suggested that in these circumstances the Government of India would presumably not wish to press their request for a guarantee,(which was probably based on a supposition that some sort of credit would be expected by the Iraqi Government), and he suggested that the facts as stated by Mr. Lambert should be explained to them. It was agreed that this could most conveniently be done by direct correspondence between the War Office and Army Headquarters, India. Colonel A^kerman^ raised the further point that, aoart from any question of guarantee, the V/ar Office were anxious that the Government of India should in regard to this and any further contracts deal direct,., as contractors, with the Iraqi Government, and that the War Office should not come into the picture at all except that they would receive the original specifications /specifications from the Iraqi Government and would oass on to the Government of India the items which they could not themselves x^roduce.

Iraq by which either country would come to the aid of the other in the event of its becoming involved in war. Partly in order to enable His Majesty*s Government to give effective military assistance to Iraq in the event of need, and partly to protect the essential British communications through Iraq to India, the Treaty provides for the maintenance in Iraq of five squadrons of the Royal Air Force, with ancillary troops* 2* To secure the close military collaboration between the two countries which is essential to the satisfactory working of the Alliance in the interest of both parties, as well as to secure the similarity in armament which is essential in view of the possibility of combined operations, it is provided in subsidiary documents attached to the Treaty that a British Military Mission shall advise the Iraqi army,1 that Iraqi officers shall receive training in the United Kingdom and that His ?.!ajesty ? s Government shall give all possible facil ities to the Iraqi Government for the provision of ’'ar ms ? amman^ t ion o eq uipmen t, s hips and aeroplan es^ of t he latest a vai la ble pattern” ^ for the Iraqi forces* It is further -provided that ’’the armament and essential equipment” of the Iraqi forces shall not differ in typo from those of the British forces 0 3 0 The effect of these arrangements would normally he to maintain British supervision and veiled control over the Iraqi Army and Air Force (octh of which were created hy British officers during the mandatory regime) and thereby to guarantee the policy of maintaining British paramountcy and British interests in the Middle East through an allied and friendly I raq« 4 0 During the mandatory regime and for a period after wards Iraq’s requirements for arms and other military stores were obtained in the United Kingdom through the Grown Agents for the Colonies 0 This procedure (which was-alleged by the Iraqi Government to be too slow) was» at the suggestion of the British Military Mission in Iraq.* replaced in February 1935 by the present arrangement, whereby orders for military stores are placed by the Iraqi Legation in London with the V/ar Office (or the Air Ministry in the case of - 2 -stores for tlie Irac^i air force)* me Irani Govenmient evapfasised at tlie time fie parcicular importance v/iiicli they attacned to receiving fro.ii the Service Departments an accurate forecast of tne date of delivery of all stores* 5* This arrangement has himcrto ’ r orheci satisfactorily so far as the Irani air retirements are concernede But Before the end laoo one Irani Government were complaining of delays in the execution of orders for their army? and in tne spring and summer of this year tneir coi.iplaints Became increasingly serious: it was stated tnat orders for almost every class of warlike stores - rifles^ ms.chine gimsj» artillery^ amnronition eoc u - were months Behind the dates upon which delivery had Been promised and tlmi even then macnine-- gtuis and artillery were despatched in an incomplete condition and were temporarily useless* Iv was alleged that the expansion of the Iraqi army was Being delayed* and that the efficiency of the existing Iraqi army was Being impaired at a time when it was engaged in internal punitive operauions* o Although in some cases Iraqi inefficiency was a contributory cause, the Iraqi complaints seem unfortunately-4- tohava. been justified in most cases, and mush dissatis faction was produced in the Iraqi army and among the general public- The whole question of the. supply of arms to Iraq from the United Kingdom ha's, however, now been brought to a head by the desire of the Iraqi Government to obtain nrlthln two years from the United Kingdom war material to the amount of between £800,000 and £1,000,000 ; for the equipment of two new Divisions- Owing to the pressing requirements of our own rearmament programme (which have, of course, been mainly responsible for delays in executing previous Iraqi oruers; une ..or Oxiice have hitherto felt unable to give a guarantee that the Iraqi requirements can be met within the two years postulated This has greatly alarmed the Iraqi Government, and in particular the Chief of the Iraqi General Staid (who has been on a visit here and has himself been in touch with the War Office), and it seems to have confirmed the impression which the Iraqis have derived from the previous delays over smaller orders that His Majesty's Government attach little importance to meeting Iraq's requirements, despite their relative smallness- The Iraqi Government feel that if the present arrangement for detaining their war material fails them in peace time it would breaK down entirely in the event of war- They have already turned to Czechoslovakia (in the spring of trie yem) for mach' guns on account of delays experienced in the United Kingdom, and they are now seriously considering the possibility of (a) turning to Germany, Czechoslovakia, Italy, or other foreign countries for the large order for/ s -5- the now Divisionsunless the,/ can obtain satisiaction from the War Office &gt; and (b) setting up factories in Iiaq_ under Geriiian guidance to manufacture as muon as possible of their military repiirementsc There are indications 9 moreover,, that their general dissatisfaction v/ith the United Kingdom is inclining the Iraqis towards buying aeroplanes in foreign countrieso To It woul.d he politically disastrous if the Iraqi Government were to turn to foreign countries for tins material. The special position which his Majesty's Govern ment enjoy in Iraq, would oe impaired, the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty would bo seriously weakened and the present close connexion between the Iraqi and British armies would probably be broken. The result would be to weaken the strategic position which His Majesty's Government enjoy on the route to India and even eventually to render it difficult to maintain the Royal Air Force bases in Iraq. A further, though less important, consideration is that the United Kingdom would lose, probably for ever, the market for supplying the. requirements of the rapidly expanding Iraqi armod iorccs. 8. On the other hand if the Iraqi wishes can be met over this order, and the necessary steps taken to ensure that the ordinary routine requirements of the Iraqi army are met punctually and satisiaci,ori^^ , t.n r. io ev . y chance that the situation can still be redresseu. and mat the Iraqis will be willing to continue to oruer their war material through the British Service he artments.

THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed (i) that, from the political point of view, it is most desirable that eve ip/ effort should be made to satisfy Iraqi demands• (ii) that, as a first step, the Foreign Office should obtain details of the equipment required, by the Iraqi Government for their two new divisions. At the same time they should point out to the Iraqi Government that our o'/n '‘efence programmes were being spread over three years, and that the Iraqi Government could scarcely expect us to satisfy their considerable demands in any lesser reriod; (iii) that thereafter the Foreign Office and the V.’ar Office should consider how far it -as possible for the latter to meet the demands resulting from the enquiries by the Foreign Office. x X x X X 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l. 1st • 1936. — O ^ October,*— IBDIA &gt;PFICE» 17th December, 1936. n\vv Ov YiZm 8680/36.

The section on Afghanistan was drafted after consultation with this Dept., and there are also short sections on Nepal and Tibet. The Secretary of State may perhaps be interested /SI- /vvl't'tv*/ in the short statement of the position regarding the supply of military aircraft to the Afghan Govt, (to which the typed supplementary memo, also refers). The Director of the Afghan Air Force is now in this country, and negotiations are proceeding, though we desire ultimately to concentrate them at Kabul. The negotiations are complicated, because we have to have regard not only to what the Air Ministry can supply, but to what the G. of I. can afford to pay for from their Afghan reserve fund; while at the same time it is desired to reach some sort of understanding with the Afghan Govt, that they will draw on this country for their requirements so far as possible^9- the/the G. of I. are inclined to make the grant of facilities for training personnel in India dependent on securing some such understanding from the Afghans as to the supply of material. It will be seen from Col.

As regards the scope of the question which the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements will consider, I should inform you that when the Foreign Office Paper was considered, discussion centered on the procedure necessary in dealing with these questions and the following procedure was agreed to: (a) All prospective foreign orders should be notified by contractors to the Defence Department concerned, who should deal with such orders on their merits, as and when they arise. (b) If it is considered that a foreign order could not be accepted as being likely to interfere with the carrying out of the Deficiency Pro grammes of the Defence Departments, such an order should be dealt with on its merits in consultation between the three Defence Depart ments, the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. T n the event of any conflict of views the question should be referred to the Minis ter for Co-ordination of Defence.(c) 1J That when any difficulty arises in the matter of supply of munitions to foreign countries, the case should he dealt with in accordance with the procedure indicated in the above conclusion. f. i Walton, Esq. , C.B. , ll, C. , India Office.8821 [13852] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Committee of Imperial Dejence. September 1936. SECRET. D.P.R. 122. O P O f Duot Copy No. v 3 COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE. Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements. THE Foreign Office desire to invite the views of the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee as to the best means of combining the fulfilment of the defence rearmament programme for this country with an increasing ability to meet applications from foreign Governments to place orders in this country for the supply of their defensive armaments requirements. The Foreign Office are fully alive to the essential necessity of placing our own requirements in the matter of defence reorganisation before every other consideration; they are also well aware of the strain which the fulfilment of our own programme is placing upon the arms-manufacturing industries in this country. They recognise the difficulties involved in giving these industries the requisite elasticity to enable them to cope with sudden and unexpected increases of orders. They feel, nevertheless, bound to put before the Committee the following considerations. The completion of our own programme of defence reorganisation will no doubt give British arms industries full occupation extending over a number of years; and for such period they will be fully occupied in carrying out the orders which appear to be ensuring to them an outlook of indefinite prosperity; but the programme will in due course be completed and, unless the industry has in the interval been able to give some considerable measure of satisfaction to prospective clients from abroad, and to carry out their contracts punctually with those foreign customers who are prepared to offer a fresh field for British industrial expansion, their period of prosperity will come to an abrupt end. There will ensue a serious reaction from the expansion of their factories to meet urgent home orders, and it will by then be too late for the firms to recover the foreign markets which will in the interval have been captured by other foreign firms. Serious as such a situation must be for British arms manufacturers and allied industries, its political consequences are a matter of even greater concern. Loss of trade in one direction may conceivably be made good in others. But the prestige and influence with her allies and other friendly foreign countries which His Majesty’s Government can enjoy through the satisfaction of their legitimate requests for assistance in carrying out defence requirements cannot be maintained by other means, in the event of those countries finding themselves unable to obtain their requirements in this country and being compelled to place their orders elsewhere. The attached memorandum has been prepared with a view to placing before the Committee the present position as seen in the Foreign Office in regard to the supply of arms from British sources to foreign Governments. Chief among these foreign Governments who are or may be desirous of placing orders in this country ? are the allies and prospective allies of His Majesty’s Government, viz., Iraq, : Portugal and Egypt, and it is, in the Foreign Office view, a matter of the greatest 1 political importance that orders for the defence requirements of these countries ! should not fie placed elsewhere than in this country, and that the organisation of their defences should not fall into foreign hands. The questions of the supply of arms to Iraq and to Belgium have been submitted separately to the Committee for their urgent consideration.2 In the case of Portugal, the Portuguese Government have been slow in defining the extent of their needs, and have not, in fact, yet stated what their full requirements are, but it is already clear that they are going to be on a largo^^ scale of rearmament, and the Foreign Office feel most strongly that both in thi^^l case and in that of Egypt, who as our new ally will, on the ratification of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, undoubtedly expect to be able to place orders for the re-equipment of her army and for other defence purposes in this country, it is politically essential that the arms-manufacturing firms in this country should be in a position to accept and fulfil these orders when received within a reasonable time. Next in immediate importance to needs of our allies come the requirements of Turkey in the matter of military aircraft, followed by those of Greece, Afghanistan and Persia, countries lying along the route to India and across our Imperial air route, which are unfortunately most liable, failing satisfaction in this country, to turn to Germany or Italy for their needs. It will also be observed that the Netherlands, the Baltic States and Finland are all disposed to place orders in this country, and that more distant countries such as those of South America and Siam might, with encouragement, become useful clients. In these circumstances the Foreign Office believe that it is necessary to give most careful consideration to the possibility not only of satisfying present foreign needs, but to make such provision as may be possible for meeting the needs of those countries w 7 hich are contemplating rearmament but have not yet announced their full requirements for defence purposes, and even of those which have not yet arrived at the stage of drawing up their own programmes. It is evident from the difficulties at present experienced by some of the foreign Governments referred to in obtaining fulfilment of even a portion of their orders in this country that a greater expansion of our arms-producing industries is required than appears to be at present contemplated; and it is to this aspect of the question that the Foreign Office w^ould especially direct the Committee’s attention. It seems certain that unless we are able to fulfil the requirements of the more important at least of our prospective clients, w^e shall pay a considerable political price for our failure. ROBERT VANSITTART. September 29, 1936.3 [13852] B 2 PORTUGAL. * SEVERAL questions are under consideration simultaneously, and for convenience the present position is summarised below :— 1. Artillery to the British Scale and Pattern for Four Divisions, 'plus Corps and Army Troops. The War Office say that if this is required within a matter of months, the order cannot be placed. Such an order would be on a scale comparable with the whole of our own re-equipment programme and orders for home must take precedence of those for Portugal. This does not mean, however, that no orders for army material can be accepted from Portugal. 2. Rifles. The Portuguese Government asked for a renewal of our assurance (a) that there is no prospect of any change being made in our service pattern rifle, and (b) that the present is a favourable moment for them to place orders with the B.S.A. since that firm are not fully occupied with orders for rifles. Sir C. Wingfield has now been told that he may renew the assurance, and that His Majesty’s Government would raise no objection to (6) provided that the orders placed are not abnormally large and subject to a final decision when the size of the orders is known. 3. Bombs for the Naval Air Service. Vickers-Armstrongs (Limited), with Air Ministry concurrence, have informed the Portuguese Embassy that, although they cannot supply all the quantities of all the types of bombs required within a relatively short time, they can and will supply a proportion of some of the types (i.e., 234 out of 340 in ten to twelve weeks). 4. Air Armaments in General. The Air Ministry state that our factories are all fully occupied with British orders, and that new types can only be secured by foreign countries with the approval of the Air Ministry. They will be prepared to consider the di\eision, when occasion demands, of a small proportion of new type aircraft from the production lines now on order for the Royal Air Force. Concessions can, however, only be made to certain countries amongst whom Portugal, in view of our alliance with her, takes high priority. The Air Ministry will welcome enquiries regarding new material and, if the Portuguese Government will send a mission to London, the Air Ministry will gladly discuss the types considered to be most suitable to Portuguese needs, and give demonstrations on the ground or in flight. They are also prepared to find vacancies at Royal Air Force schools or squadrons for officers of countries which use British equipment, and they have indeed in the past received Portuguese officers. As a further proof of their interest, they suggest that a Portuguese Air Attache should be accredited to the Embassy in London. 5. It should be added that the Portuguese Government have been considering the question of their rearmament for several years past. On the 29th January of this year the Portuguese Foreign Minister, when on a visit to this country, informed the Secretary of State that his Government intended to spend 5 millions upon the rearmament of their army during the next few years, and that they would prefer to spend this money in Great Britain. The Secretary of State replied that we should be only too pleased that Portugal should derive her supplies of arms in the main from this country. 6. Further, on the 1st August last His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Lisbon was authorised to speak to the Secretary-General of the Mumstiv foi Foreign Affairs on the following lines :— “ In view of the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Portugal it is very probable from the point of view of both countries that in any crisis they would be working in co-operation as allies. In these circumstances it would clearly be of advantage that the two armies should be supplied with4 similar arms and equipment in so far as this will facilitate co-operation. When it is known what purchases the Portuguese Government wish to make His Majesty’s Government will do all they can consistent with their owq^^ rearmament programme to assist them in placing orders with British firm^^ and in obtaining delivery within satisfactory periods.” The recent conflict in Spain and the reluctance of the Portuguese to commit themselves to non-intervention afford perhaps an additional reason for giving them satisfaction with regard to their rearmament and for strengthening them as far as possible against any possible eventual unpleasant reactions from a future Spanish Government. EGYPT. On the 26th August last a Treaty of Alliance between the United Kingdom and Egypt was signed in London, and on the same day in amplification of the military clauses of that Treaty the Egyptian Prime Minister sent to the Secretary of State a letter, from which the following are extracts :— I wish to place on record certain further understandings in connexion with the Treaty of Alliance .... ;Fhe Egyptian Government .... will avail themselves of the advice of a British Military Mission. 3. In the interests of the Alliance and in view of the possible necessity of co-operative action between the British and Egyptian forces, the rearmament and equipment, land and air, of the Egyptian forces shall not • 1 P 1 tyP e those of the British forces. His Majesty’s Government m ^6 united Kingdom undertake to use their good offices to facilitate the suppty of such armament and equipment from the United Kingdom, at prices similar to those which would be paid by His Majesty’s Government, whenever the Egyptian (government so desire . . . .” It is essential that applications from the Egyptian Government should recen-e every possible consideration. The British and Egyptian forces in Egypt will m the event of war become practically one army. In other words the two armies will be required to fight together as one in' defence of Egypt and the hudan—point of vital strategic importance to the British Empire The Egyptians have become our allies, but more than that they must be allies on whom we can depend for their help and co-operation may well be needed some dav the War Office are understood to be preparing very strong recommendations on these lines and are doing what they can to ensure that the Egyptian Army which will be advised and trained by a British Military Mission, shall be at well equipped in every way as the British Army. Not only would it be a pofitTca mistake to refuse Egyptian applications for the supply of arms (for we are bound under the Treaty to supply them), but it would be a grave error on practical grounds to leave the protection of vital imperial interests to British tretps hampered by ill-equipped and consequently disgruntled and unreliable allies ^ TURKEY. about a year ago one of our great difficulties in dealing with Turkey T aS .i- th u p 0Stlllty anc ' sus P le i° n of the Turkish General Staff. S Althou^h the anitudp ( ' 0 ' e, ' n , me ’U have been for many years adopting an increasingly friendlv attitude towards this country, the suspicion of the General Staff appeared ineradicaMe. Our Military and Naval ittaches met with constanfobslrucGon the exercise of then ordinary duties, and it was clear that any kind of close co-operation between this country and Turkey in military, naval or air matters was out of the question. “^^ers 2. Largely as a result of the political developments following on the Abyssinian crisis, and of increasing Turkish nervousness of Italian ambitions against which friendship with His Majesty’s Government appeared to offer thebest form of insurance, the attitude of the Turks in the autumn of 1935 began to 'Change very considerably. The political friendship which already existed was demented by a series of events culminating in the Montreux Straits Conference, and, more recently, in The King’s visit to Gallipoli and Constantinople. Towards the end of 1935 the opposition and suspicion of the Turkish General Staff appeared to have been finally overcome, and at the beginning of 1936 they seemed definitely to have decided to aim at a close association with this country, not only in political, but also in military, naval and air matters. 3. It is perhaps hardly necessary to emphasise the importance of this change from the point of view of British Imperial, strategic and political interests. In the event of any conflict breaking out likely to threaten our position or communications in the Eastern Mediterranean or the Middle East, the friendship and co-operation of Turkey might be of the utmost value. If we could cement this friendship by closely associating Turkey with us in military, naval and air matters, we might bring about a situation which would strengthen our defence position in this area far more effectively and at a far smaller cost than would be the case if we had to rely solely on our own resources. On the other hand, if circumstances oblige us to rebuff Turkey’s new and recent advances, we cannot exclude the possibility of the Turks making up their minds to turn elsewhere, and gradually drift, as a result, into a totally different political alignment, as a result of which we would no longer be able to count upon their friendship. 4. The first tangible sign of the changing outlook of the Turkish General Staff was a request addressed by the Turkish Government to His Majesty’s Government early in February of this year, for assistance in equipping the new Turkish air force with British aircraft. The original proposal was for the supply of British aircraft to the value of something like £1 million. The Foreign Office appreciated the political importance of this proposal, and made every possible effort to secure its acceptance. But before the service aspect of the matter could be gone into in detail, financial difficulties arose, chiefly owing to the fact that, as a result of an adverse trade balance, Turkey was unable to produce the necessary sterling, so that the aircraft could only have been supplied either as a gift by His Majesty’s Government, or on the basis of a British loan, which made it impracticable, with the best will in the world, to proceed with the matter on anything like the original scale. Eventually the Turks, who fully appreciated the financial difficulties involved, decided to place a much smaller order in this country, more or less on a trial basis. 5. The difficulties attending this smaller order have been serious'. For some months the financial question was still a formidable obstacle. This has now, however, been overcome. Then the Turks changed their order from fighting aircraft—which they originally required, and which could have been more easily supplied—to Blenheim bombers, where construction is, I understand, already in arrears, and which are most urgently needed for our own purposes. But even so the delays and difficulties have been inordinate. Much loss of time was caused by the fact that, at what we hoped was the last moment, it was discovered that part of the equipment of the aircraft required was secret. The Air Ministry hold that the aircraft to be supplied to the Turks must conform in every particular with the aircraft required by the Air Ministry, in order that production may not be delayed, and that they may be available for our own needs if there is any hitch over payment, while at the same time several essential features of their equipment —and especially the new rear-gun turrets—must not be supplied to the Turks, since they are of secret design. It is hoped that we have now solved this problem also, but the Turks have complained bitterly of the additional delays which it has caused. 6. The present position is that the Air Ministry have agreed to release the twelve bombing aircraft required by giving them certain numbers in their own construction series. These numbers will be Nos. 31 and 32 and 191-200. But even so, no guarantee can be given of the date by which these numbers will be ready, and, while it was at first understood that the latest order would be com pleted by the end of next summer, the Air Ministry have now felt bound to qualify this, and say that they do not think it can be promised until next November. This has produced a further complaint from the Turks and seems likely to hold up the whole matter a good deal longer. Although historical6 parallels are often misleading, it is only necessary to remember how disastrously events were affected in 1914 by our requisitioning of the two battleships then building in this country for Turkey, to realise that a mere concentration on ouj^ own armaments in disregard of considerations of international policy may some times prove dangerous. 7. In spite of this, the Turks have now enquired, in a letter of the 19th September, whether we cannot allow them to purchase a further twenty fighting aeroplanes, either of the Fairey “ Battle ' or of the “ Westland ” type. The question whether they are to enter into negotiations with the firms concerned depends entirely on whether the aircraft can be released, and if so, on what date. The matter is at present in the hands of the Air Ministry. 8. As a result of these various difficulties which the Turks have met with in trying to obtain aircraft from this country, there are indications that they are in active negotiation with aircraft firms in the United States and France and are pursuing active enquiries also in Germany and Czechoslovakia. The American and French orders, in particular, appear to be very large—and may amount to over 250 aircraft. But the greater political risk is that of the Turks falling into military and economic dependence on Germany or Russia. For various reasons this risk—though the Turks are alive to it—is a serious one, and if Turkey once more slipped into such a situation, it would become much less likely that, in the event of any conflict, we should find her willing to associate herself with us and give us either active or passive assistance. It was, indeed, largely by establishing a close association and predominant position with the Turkish army before the War, that Germany was eventually able to count on Turkey’s military support when the War came. 9. Another aspect of the matter which the Foreign Office have had much in mind has been that, when the present period of intensive Royal Air Force expansion comes to an end, it may be most difficult to find adequate markets to keep the British aircraft industry fully occupied. The Near and Middle East is a region particularly fitted by climate and geography for aircraft development of all kinds. If then the British aircraft industry can take the present opportunity to establish a close connexion with Turkey and the other Middle Eastern countries, the connexion may prove of the utmost value when the present period of intensive construction finishes. PERSIA. A considerable number of British military aircraft are at present in use in Persia, and a British civilian expert is employed by the Persian Government as technical adviser to the Persian air force, in addition to a Belgian military adviser. The latter is understood to be opposed to the interest of British manufacturers. 2. The Persian Government recently contemplated the purchase of further British aircraft, and a special mission was sent to this country for that purpose in June of this year. Every effort was made by the Hawker-Siddeley Company, and by the Foreign Office and Air Ministry to make this visit a success. General Nakhtchevan, the head of the Mission, was entertained at a luncheon and intro duced to Lord Swinton, and was shown the various aircraft establishments which he desired to inspect. The results achieved by the Mission are not yet known in full, but a representative of the Hawker-Siddeley Company was informed confidentially that the Mission had strongly recommended the purchase of British aircraft. 3. As with the case of the Turkish order, British manufacturers are meeting with serious competition from abroad. It is known that the Persian Government buy considerable quantities of arms from Czechoslovakia and Sweden with money obtained from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company royalties. The Persian Mission visited Germany as well as this country, and at least one of its members—and, it is also said in some quarters, the Shah himself—is in favour of purchasing war material in Germany. In order to forestall, if possible, the— mmm 7 diversion of aircraft orders to other countries, instructions have been sent to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran to do what he can to influence the competent Departments of the Persian Government in favour of placing the 'rder in the United Kingdom. 4. From the point of view of Imperial strategical policy Persia is scarcely less important than Turkey, in view of her situation on the route to India, and as the source of a large part of the oil supplies of the Empire. The present Persian Government are intensely suspicious of everything British, but great efforts have been made during the last few years to reduce the causes of friction and it is felt that, as in the case of Turkey, relations could be greatly improved if the Persian Government could be induced to turn to this country for their supplies of war material and capital goods. Moreover, it is a major British political interest that Persia should not fall into a state of dependence, whether political, economic or military, on any other country, and that she should be strong enough to stand alone as an entirely independent national State. For these reasons, the Foreign Office hold the view that if the aircraft order at present under discussion materialises, every effort ought to be made to release the aircraft required and to facilitate as far as possible the negotiation of the contract. AFGHANISTAN. Rifles and Small A rms Munitions .A . Negotiations with the Afghan Government regarding the supply of “ 303 ” rifles and ammunition to the Afghan Government have been in progress since early in 1935, and His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul reported on the 20th September that the Afghan Government had accepted the offer of His Majesty’s Government for the sale of 25,000 “ 303 ” 1914 rifles, the delivery of which is to be completed during 1937. This sale is to be financed out of the Government of India Afghan reserve fund and a similar arrangement has been made for the sale of small arms ammunition from the Government of India’s stocks. His Majesty’s Government are completely committed to supply these articles to the Afghan Government. Aircraft. In 1935 the Afghan Government requested His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul to inform His Majesty’s Government that they desired to purchase twenty-four military aeroplanes. After prolonged correspondence between His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul and the competent Departments in this country, the Govern ment of India agreed in May to make available in 1936-37 £30,000 from the Afghan Reserve Fund which would be enough for five machines. The Air Ministry have undertaken to provide six machines in 1936-37 and possibly a further six machines in 1937-38. The Afghan Government told His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul on the 1st September that they had decided to buy up to eight machines from His Majesty’s Government, but a definite request and information regarding the types desired by the Afghan Government is awaited. The Commandant of the Afghan Air Force is on his way to Europe to collect for his Government information regarding types and the possibility of Afghan pilots being trained, preferably in India. For political reasons it would be desirable that His Majesty’s Government should supply Afghanistan with up to eight aircraft during the next eighteen months and facilitate arrangements for the training of Afghan pilots. If His Majesty’s Government do not provide assistance in these matters to the Afghan Government, other Powers, such as Italy or Germany, will probably do so and might use to the disadvantage of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India the influence thereby acquired.8 GREECE. The source from which Greece obtains her military equipment is of major political interest to His Majesty’s Government. The importance of maintaining^ our military prestige in the Eastern Mediterranean needs no emphasising, and for this reason it is essential that Greece should look to us for assistance and advice in defence matters, more especially as that country is cast for the role of “ point d’appui ” to our fleet in time of war. For this reason we have long maintained a naval mission in Athens as well as an Air Adviser. If we should cease to interest ourselves in Greek defence we should almost certainly be ousted within a very short time by Germany, from whom competition to supply arms to the Greek Government is already sufficiently keen. For months past we have been endeavouring to secure a contract for the supply of destroyers to the Greek Navy, and although the Greeks have made considerable difficulties over the adjudication we are still hopeful of securing the lion’s share of this order for a British firm. This order deserves high priority in the list of foreign orders. The same would apply to military aircraft which the Greek Government show a disposition to purchase in this country, and, payment difficulties notwith standing, every effort should be made to secure such orders as are forthcoming provided they can be executed. Greek aircraft enquiries on the stocks include an order for twenty-four Gladiator type aircraft, which the Air Ministry have expressed their readiness to release. Generally speaking, His Majesty’s Minister has received instructions to give every possible support to British aircraft firms competing for Greek orders. THE NETHERLANDS. The Netherlands Government have been considering their rearmament during the past year, and on the 26th August last a Bill was introduced into Parliament proposing the construction of 2 destroyers, 4 submarines, 60 flying boats and 39 land planes. The money for this rearmament has not yet been voted by Parliament. 2. On the 16th September Dr. Colijn, the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, informed our Air Attache at The Hague that a Dutch Mission would be arriving in the United Kingdom on the 21st September to enquire into the construction of British flying boats, and another mission would arrive about two months later to enquire into the construction of land planes. A contract for six Dornier flying boats has already, it seems, been placed with the German firm, and the Air Attache does not consider that British flying boats would be satisfactory for the Netherlands East Indies. It might be possible, however, to fit British engines into whatever flying boats are purchased or built by the Netherlands Government. There would seem to be much more chance of the orders for the thirty-nine land planes being placed in this country by the mission, which is expected later on. 3. On the 21st July last Dr. Colijn, when on a visit to this country, told the Secretary of State that he felt our Service Departments could give him advice as to the expenditure of some 11 million which the Netherlands have now decided to spend on her Far Eastern Defences. The Secretary of State informed Dr. Colijn that while the integrity of the Dutch Colonies in the Far East was a matter of concern to us, His Majesty’s Government could, of course, accept no commitment in connexion with them. FINLAND. A ir craft. In March the Finnish Government placed an order, valued at £200,000, for eighteen Bristol Blenheims, but the final contract still awaits signature. A contract was concluded in May with the Bristol Company for the supply of thirty Mercury engines and forty-four Pegasus engines. Eighteen of the Mercury[13852] c 9 engines are for installation in the Bristol planes, and delivery of the Pegasus engines is to begin in the current year, and to be continued throughout 1937. At end of August His Majesty’s Minister at Helsingfors was informed that the innish Government intended to purchase, in addition to the aircraft mentioned above, seventeen fighters, but that the final decision as to the type to be ordered and the country where the contract was to be placed would rest with Field-Marshal Baron Mannerheim, Chairman of the Defence Council. Tanks. In July Vickers-Armstrongs informed His Majesty’s Government that they had concluded a contract, valued at £152,000, with the Finnish Government for the supply of thirty-two tanks, eleven to be delivered in 1937, ten in 1938, and eleven in 1939. Proposals for the further purchase of war material in the United Kingdom may be made as a result of Baron Mannerheim’s present visit to this country. LATVIA. Anti-tank Gun. Late in 1935 the Latvian Government asked His Majesty’s Government to authorise the purchase of a new and improved anti-tank gun then under construction. Difficulties, however, were encountered in giving this authorisa tion, and the Latvian Government finally withdrew their request. A ircraft. In April 1936 the Latvian Government concluded a contract for the delivery in July or August 1937 of thirteen Hawker “ Gladiators.” Permission was also obtained to equip the machines in question with fifty-two Vickers machine guns from stocks at Enfield. No further orders on the part of the Latvian Government appear to be either in contemplation or impending. The Latvian Government have informed His Majesty’s Government that they are anxious to purchase all their armament requirements in this country, and to induce the Estonian and Lithuanian Governments to do the same, as part of a plan to co-ordinate the armaments of the three Baltic States. ESTONIA. A ir craft. In March 1936 General Laidoner, the Chief of the Estonian General Staff, let it be known that the Estonian Government were desirous of buying ten bombing aeroplanes, and it was proposed that funds for this purpose should be provided by the conversion of the 7 per cent. League of Nations Estonian loan. No progress, however, has yet been made on these lines owing to technical difficulties in the way of the conversion operation, and the only aircraft Estonia has purchased during the current year is one machine constructed by A. V. Roe and Co., the release of which has recently been sanctioned by the Air Ministry. In general, the Estonian Government, like the Latvian Government, are known to be anxious to place further orders in this country for war material of all sorts, as soon as their financial situation permits. Naval Armaments. Two submarines under construction for the Estonian Government by Vickers- Armstrong were launched in the current year, and are due for delivery in April 1937. LITHUANIA. In April of the current year the Lithuanian Government requested that permission might be granted for the release of three Avro and ten Bristol Blenheim machines, and also for the construction under licence of twenty10 airframes of the latter type, the engines to be purchased from the Bristol Aviation Company. Subsequently, however, it appeared that the Lithuanian Government hacL changed their plans, as the Air Attache to His Majesty’s Legation at Kovno wg® informed that estimates for fourteen Gloucester Gladiators had been asked for, and that, if the estimates were commercially acceptable, an application for the release of these machines would be made through the Lithuanian Legation in London. So far, however, no such application has been received. At the beginning of the year Vickers Armstrongs discussed with the Lithuanian Government the sale of between twenty-five and thirty tanks, but it is not known how far the negotiations have progressed. In view of the present needs of the Lithuanian Air Force the Lithuanian market is potentially of a certain importance. Lithuania is already a considerable purchaser of British engines of the Bristol type, and is now negotiating further purchases. There is also a possibility of Lithuanian orders in a combined scheme of purchases for the three Baltic States (see under Latvia). SWEDEN. In 1935 the Swedish Government placed an order for two “ 53 ” type Handley-Page bombers, but the company later desired, for technical reasons, to transfer the order to the “ 52 type, a more up-to-date machine, which is being manufactured for His Majesty’s Government. No final decision in regard to this matter has yet been taken. It is learned from the Air Ministry that the Swedish Government have recently placed an order for three Gloucester Gladiators, and that there is a possibility of further orders later. NORWAY. A ircraft. At the beginning of 1935 a contract was signed for the sale, by Messrs. Armstrong Whitworth, to the Norwegian Government of four Scimitar aeroplanes, and for the acquisition of the right to build aeroplanes in Norway under licence with materials supplied by the firm in question. As the tests proved unsatis factory, the Norwegian Government cancelled the contract, but further negotiations resulted in the four machines being finally purchased. No further purchases of war material by the Norwegian Government are known to be either contemplated or impending. U.S.S.R. In May an enquiry was addressed to the Fairey Aviation Company as to the terms on which they would be willing to sell “ Battle” type aircraft to the Soviet Government. The Air Ministry were of opinion that the enquiry was unlikely to lead to any considerable sales to the Soviet Government, and that the latter were merely desirous of obtaining one prototype in order to study it or to ■bhe Air Ministry agreed to the sale of and were this machine on the condition that the onn H-on sale should not ta&amp;e place before a delay of from three to six months'. _ he Soviet $^P- SOUTH AMERICA. ARGENTINA. Seven Destroyers. The Argentine Government signed a contract in May for the supply of seven destroyers by United Kingdom firms. The contract is understood to be worth about £2 million, and was secured, although firms in the United States had also been invited to tender.10 airframes of the latter type, the engines to be purchased from the Bristol Aviation Company. Subsequently, however, it appeared that the Lithuanian Government ha^^ changed their plans, as the Air Attache to His Majesty’s Legation at Kovno wg® informed that estimates for fourteen Gloucester Gladiators had been asked for, and that, if the estimates were commercially acceptable, an application for the release of these machines would be made through the Lithuanian Legation in London.

The Air Ministry were of opinion that the enquiry was unlikely to lead to any considerable sales to the Soviet Government, and that the latter were merely desirous of obtaining one prototype in order to study it or to Dopy it in their own factories. The Air Ministry consulted the Foreign Office as to whether there was any political objection to the sale taking place and were informed in the negative; but they teld the company that, fur the rcaoonn givon »feovo-4ih6y would not ngrfiin to the Gftfc A ' Metrovickers (Limited) have just been approached on behalf of the Soviet Government, with the offer of an order for the engines of a large battleship. SOUTH AMERICA. ARGENTINA. Seven Destroyers. The Argentine Government signed a contract in May for the supply of seven destroyers by United Kingdom firms. The contract is understood to be worth about £2 million, and was secured, although firms in the United States had also been invited to tender.11 [13852] c 2 The first approach to His Majesty’s Government had been made in December 1935 by the Argentine Naval Mission then in this country, through the Argentine ^^mbassador to the Department of Overseas Trade. Delay before the contract was .mally placed was caused by the Argentine Government’s requirements in the matter of fire control gear. As a result of this delay the question was again raised by Sr. Le Breton, the Argentine delegate, who was in London to negotiate a new commercial treaty with this country, who expressed concern lest the conditions imposed by the xVdmiralty with regard to the disclosure of confidential infor mation in respect of fire control gear might drive the Argentines to go to other countries for their naval contracts. Nevertheless, owing to the special efforts made by the Admiralty to meet the Argentine requirements, the contracts were duly placed. The Admiralty stated, however, that owing to their own deficiency programme, it was very doubtful whether the construction of the destroyers could be speeded up so that the vessels might, as the Argentine Government desired, be delivered in Argentina before the present Government leaves office at the end of February 1938. BRAZIL. Nine Destroyers. 1. The Brazilian Government some months ago asked various United Kingdom firms, among others Vickers, Samuel White, and Thornycroft, for tenders for the supply of destroyers. In August of this year His Majesty’s Embassy at Rio learned that Vickers had informed the Brazilian Government that they could not undertake construction without the prior consent of the Admiralty. As it was feared that this might lead to misunderstanding, and since it was understood that certain sections of opinion in Brazil were in favour of placing the contracts elsewhere, especially in Germany, in order to liquidate Brazilian accumulated “ compensation ” credits, it was decided that the Naval Attache in South America should proceed to Rio and explain the position under the deficiency programme to the Brazilian Government. It was stated that the Admiralty’s policy was not to place avoidable restrictions on firms desirous of obtaining foreign orders provided the acceptance of these orders did not prejudice the rapid completion of the British deficiency programme. In general all encouragement should be given to foreign Governments, but each particular case must be treated on its own merits, and firms were required to notify the Admiralty before committing themselves to accepting foreign orders. The Admiralty stated, however, that they had no objection to British firms accepting the Brazilian contract at present under discussion. The Minister for Foreign Affairs put this point to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and received an answer in the above sense. As a result, His Majesty’s Embassy have learned that instructions have now been sent to the Brazilian Ambassador in London to ascertain from His Majesty’s Government whether Vickers, who on account of the cancellation of a battleship order in 1914 are considered to have a prior claim to contracts for the Brazilian Government, can build nine destroyers for the Brazilian Government and supply armament for six submarines which are to be built in July. Nothing has, however, yet been heard from the Brazilian Ambassador. Fifteen Avro Trainer Planes. 2. The Air Attache learned in August that the Brazilian Government had ordered fifteen “ Avro ” trainers (value about £60,000) in the United Kingdom. The Naval Attache pointed out that this tendency to place orders with the United Kingdom should be encouraged, since the equipment of the Brazilian Army Air Service is at present 95 per cent. American. It is believed that the Brazilian Air Service require or may require a further twenty trainer planes, forty or more fighters and bombers,' and also twenty transport planes for the Army Air Transport Service (whose equipment is at present entirely supplied by the United States). It is also understood that the Navy is in need of flying-boats.CHILE. Possible Naval Orders. m Like Argentina and Brazil, Chile has also recently voted a considerable sum of money for rearmament purposes. The Commercial Secretary understands that so far as the army is concerned orders are likely to be placed in Germany with a view to liquidating the credits which Chile has accumulated as a result of increased “ compensation ” sales to that country. The orders are likely to be on a barter basis. The Commercial Secretary learned, however, that the navy are determined to place their orders in this country. But there is some doubt whether any money will be available for the Navy, and in any case it is likely that difficulties of payment will arise as the Chilean Government are not likely to be able to find sufficient sterling. COLOMBIA. Request for Six A rmoured Cars. In August the Colombian Government informed His Majesty’s Legation at Bogota that they were asking for quotations for two and, if successful, six light armoured cars for police patrol work in the cities. It was explained that quick delivery was essential and that continental firms could not supply the cars in under five months. Vickers, who were approached as the chief firm supplying this type of goods, stated that, owing to the exigencies of the War Office rearma ment programme, they were unable to undertake this order. His Majesty’s Minister urged in reply that this contract was of considerable importance as the key-contract to other important orders, and emphasised that the lack of interest in Colombian Government business shown by British firms was having a serious effect on British trade prospects in the country. With the consent of the War Office these arguments were put up to Vickers, but the same reply was obtained. DOMINICA. Service Rifles. In June His Majesty’s Minister was asked to obtain quotations for 3,000 rifles, with bayonets, of the British Service pattern, and for 500 rounds of ammunition for each. These quotations were duly supplied by B.S.A. Guns (Limited). PERU. Hydrographic Vessel. On the 7th September the Peruvian Minister in London asked to be placed in touch with British firms with a view to the supply of a hydrographic vessel of 400 to 500 tons for the Peruvian Ministry of Marine. PHILIPPINES. Torpedo Boats. In August the Consulate-General at Manila were asked by the Philippine military authorities for specifications of fast torpedo boats similar to those at present supplied to the Royal Navy. It is understood that similar requests have been made to the Italian and United States authorities. The Admiralty have agreed to tenders being supplied by United Kingdom firms. It is not expected that more than a few torpedo boats will be required by the Philippine Govern ment, since their main expenditure on armaments will be reserved until the realisation of complete independence in 1946. It is believed that the Philippine authorities may similarly desire to acquire a few military aeroplanes for training purposes.13 URUGUAY. JPolice Motor Cycles. In May of this year a visit was paid to this country by Major Blanco of the Uruguayan police. He had authority to spend about £5,000 on motor-cycles, and about £15,000 on armoured cars. Major Blanco was placed in touch with the police authorities here and was given the names of United Kingdom firms supplying the type of motor-cycle required. The armoured cars, it is believed, have been ordered in France. VENEZUELA. Tenders for Destroyers and Gunboats. The Government of President Lopez Contreras have expressed their inten tion of building up the Venezuelan navy, which was completely neglected under General Gomez. In January of this year they made enquiries as to the possibility of purchasing a destroyer of about 1,700 tons and two gunboats of about 650 tons m this country, payment being made of 25 per cent, in cash and 75 per cent, in coffee. Various United Kingdom firms were approached, and in spite of doubts expressed as to the terms of payment, and as to the possibility of delivering vessels in the time demanded by the Venezuelan Government, Messrs. Thornycroft and Messrs. Yarrow offered quotations. It is understood that German, French, Italian and Spanish firms were also asked to quote, and in the case of the two gun boats a particularly low-priced offer was received from the Argentine Government. FAR EASTERN COUNTRIES. No direct requests have been received from the Governments of Far Eastern countries for the support of His Majesty’s Government in supplying their needs. The following notes bear on the general problem of the supply of arms to Far Eastern countries in present circumstances : — SIAM. We have considerable political interest in continuing to supply arms to Siam. Supply of arms is linked with the training of Siamese officers in this country, and on the latter depends the maintenance of our influence in Siamese Naval and Military circles. (It has already been challenged with considerable success by the Italians.) In the first nine months of 1936 export licences were granted for orders totalling some £19,750. (Mainly machine guns and small arms ammunition.) The Siamese have grandiose ideas of armaments, and it is difficult to gauge their requirements. It is, however, desirable that we should meet Siamese requirements wherever possible. If Siamese enquiries cannot be considered as favourably as in the past, it is essential that, in compensation, more attractive facilities should be provided for the training of Siamese officers in British Naval, Military and Air establishments. CHINA. The supply of arms to China is governed largely by commercial considera tions. Its continuation is not at the moment a matter of outstanding political importance. In the first nine months of 1936 export licences were granted for orders totalling some £200,000. With regard to future requirements, Vickers have tendered for the supply of eight Vickers 6-inch coast defence guns (£200,000) in connexion with the Yangtze Defence Scheme, but it seems unlikely that they will obtain the contract.JAPAN. There are no political reasons why arms should be supplied to Japan, rathej^ the reverse. In the first nine months of 1936 export licences were granted for orders totalling about £16,700. NEPAL. There are strong political reasons for continuing to supply arms to Nepal, but this is largely the concern of the India Office. The Nepalese Government are understood to have ordered in this country plant for the manufacture of Martini Henry ammunition, hitherto supplied by India but now no longer manufactured there. There are good reasons for allowing this order to go forward. TIBET. V/U kvVvJ , ' rU The supply of arms to Tibet is intimately bound up with the maintenance of British influence in that country. The Government of India anticipate a request f or_rifle s from the Tibetan Government. If these are to be supplied it will be out of the stock of second-hand 1914 pattern rifles in this country. The quantity will, in any case, be small. This is, however, primarily the concern of the India Office. &amp; YUGOSLAVIA. » ^ Our interest in Yugoslavia’s defence requirements is concerned partly with our prestige in the Eastern Mediterranean, and partly with the wish to forestall German arms contracts and the political influence accruing therefrom. Although recent contracts for heavy naval armaments and anti-aircraft guns have been secured by Czechoslovak and Swedish firms respectively, the position is that Messrs. Vickers-Armstrong may be able to obtain contracts for fire control apparatus and torpedoes, if, indeed, they have not already obtained them. The Yugoslav naval programme (three torpedo-boat destroyers, three motor tugs, three barges and one tanker) was, apparently, divided between Messrs. Yarrow’s and a French firm. We are equally interested in equipping the Yugoslav air force with British aircraft. We should do everything we can to ensure that British firms who succeed in securing orders should be given every assistance in effecting prompt delivery. Although our chief competitors in the Yugoslav armaments market have hitherto been the French and the Czechs, we have now to reckon with competition of a more formidable, and politically dangerous, nature from Germany. BULGARIA. Bulgaria, as an ex-enemy, is, strictly speaking, subject still to the armaments clauses of her peace treaty (but this is no longer observed). Vague enquiries about armaments reach us from time to time from Sofia. Messrs. Vickers have recently secured an order for eight heavy tanks for the Bulgarian army, and their export has been authorised. There is the possibility of a further order for fifty light tanks, but this is not worth taking very seriously, for the reason that even were we in a position to deliver the goods we should probably be expected to do so on virtually impossible credit terms. Any political interest in keeping a foothold in the Bulgarian arms market would be as in the case of Greece and Yugoslavia in order to counteract German penetration.15 ROUMANIA. The Roumanian arms market is largely a French and Czechoslovak preserve, .&lt;s witness the commercial agreement concluded with France at the beginning of this year, of which the supply of French armaments to Roumania was a leading feature. In connexion with a recent proposal by the Roumanians to sell oil to our Admiralty and Air Ministry to the value of £800,000, which would be expended on the purchase of arms in this country, His Majesty’s Minister at Bucharest tendered the advice that we should interest ourselves in supplying arms to Roumania and help her to organise a local arms industry. Our interest in this would be again to counteract German penetration, and at the same time to offset the predominating influence of France. This argument, incidentally, appears all the stronger since the retreat of M. Titulescu from the scene. On the other hand, it may be argued that outweighing the above purely political interest our main desire at the moment is to get the Roumanians to pay their debts, and it may well be undesirable to stultify our commercial policy in the interests of securing orders for British armament firms. In any case, the need of giving priority to Roumanian arms orders seems slight. HUNGARY. Germany and Italy have a big footing in this market, which is not one where our firms could expect to compete successfully. ALBANIA. There is a British Inspector-General of Gendarmerie in Albania, but, so far as supplying arms is concerned, Italy may be said to monopolise Albania, and this market, therefore, can be disregarded. AUSTRIA. Austria has her own arms industry, and for such equipment as she cannot make herself she would probably, for financial, if not for political, reasons, turn to Italy and/or Germany in preference to ourselves or the French/Czechs. CZECHOSLOVAKIA. Czechoslovakia is a major arms-producing country, and we have neither political interest nor commercial scope in this market. ITALY. Italy is in the same position as Czechoslovakia. POLAND. Poland is having two destroyers built in this country, and they are almost completed. She has also ordered from us fairly recently 100 Bristol aeroplane engines. Hitherto we have frequently pressed Poland to place Government orders in this country, but presumably in future it will be useless to expect that Poland will pl^ce any orders for war material in this country in view of the recent arrangements believed to have been concluded during General Rydz-Smigly’s recent visit to Paris whereby the French Government are to give Poland credit for the purchase of war material in France.BELGIUM. The Belgian Government frequently import minor consignments of wai^ material, e.g., spare parts for tanks, T.N.T., &amp;c., from firms in this country, am negotiations were concluded three days ago whereby the Belgian Military Air Service is to purchase fifteen single-seater fighter aircraft from the Hawker Aircraft Company, and a further seven are to be constructed under licence in Belgium.I SV (THIS DOGUIviENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHJO IvF,JBSTY f S GOV'Ri'JluTTTT)o S S G RET .

Lij%g of the Board of Trade (C.P.-288 (30)) pointing out that the Board of Trade, as the licensing authority, always consult the Service Departments and the Foreign Office in regard to any applications for licences for the exportation to foreign countries of substantial quantities of munitions, andthat, except when objection is taken by one of the Departments consulted, the Board of Trade issue the licenses without question. Instances were given of occasions when the expectation of munitions to particular destinations was either absolutely stopped or rigidly curtailed owing to the attitude of other Departments, who were governed by the general principle that munitions should not be sent to foreign countries at times when the political horizon is clouded and when there is a risk of the outbreak of war, foreign or civil, and more especially where there is any danger of the munitions being used against His Majesty's forces. The Board of Trade had no reason to believe that any substantial volumes of orders had been lost owing to the fact that our armament firms have to tender subject to their being able in due course to obtain a licence, whereas firms in other countries were not similarly hampered. It was pointed out that if ever the Arms Traffic International Convention was brought into force we should in any case be under an obligation to maintain the licensing system: also that even if it were decided to abandon the requirements of individual licences it would still be inevitable that some restriction should be placed on the expectation of munitions if political conditions in foreign countries required it: A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (C.P.-294 (30)) covering a Memorandum prepared in the War Office showing the effect of the present policy EXPORT OF WAR MATERIALS AND WARSHIPS, (Previous Reference: Cabinet 46 (30).Con clusion 7.) 8. The Cabinet had before them the following Memoranda on the subject of the export of war materials, prepared as the result of the Cabinet Conclusion referred to in the margin:- A Memorandum by the Presidentof prohibiting the sale of Government- owned surplus arms and munitions to foreign Governments, whether directly or through private contractors, and expressing the view that this embargo should be raised except in cases where it is desirable to maintain it for political and military reasons, of which the Foreign Office and War Office would be the judges. In the War Office Memorandum evidence was given to show that since the Cabinet decisions of October 30,1929, the demand for surplus arms and ammunition by certain foreign countries has been maintained and is likely to continue, and that these demands, instead of being met in this country, have been met abroad. In short, the effect of the embargo had been, not to reduce the traffic in arms, but simply to divert it into other channels, to the disadvantage of this country; A Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (C.P. 314 (30)) associating himself very strongly with the proposal of the Secretary of State for War for the abrogation of the Cabinet ruling on the subject of the sale to foreign countries of Government war material. Attached to his Memorandum was a Paper prepared by the Admiralty Staff, giving instances of how seriously the existing embargo operates to the detriment of British trade. In particular, attention was drawn to a case now requiring decision, in which Vickers Armstrong’s have made enquiry for some high angle gun equipments for sale to the Chinese Nationalist Government. Our refusal to supply this requirement, which could only be met from surplus stocks in the possession of the Admiralty, would hamper the trading activities of the firm and would be liable to be misunderstood by the Chinese Government, whom we are assisting with a Naval Mission and by the training of naval officers in our Navy. Sven if the embargo were maintained, the First Lord submitted that the application should be treated as outside the scope of the Cabinet’s intention. The Memorandum was extended to cover the cognate question of the private export trade of this country in warships and war material, andlt was urged that at a time when the Admiralty’s orders are at a very low ebb it is important to do everything possible to remove obstacles from the way of this trade, and that theV the Cabinet should give consideration to all possible measures towards that end. Prom this point of view of the employment situation it was a matter of serious concern, more especially as Italy is making special efforts, by long credit apparently with Government support, to secure every possible order fop foreign warships and material. In the accompanying Aomiralty Staff Memorandum it was pointed out that many orders could be obtained by this country if armament firms were assisted materially so as to be able to offer long term credit, which at present is not permitted under either the Oversea Trade (Credit and Insurance) Act,1920, or the Export Credits Scheme and the Trade Facilities Act. Having regard to the fact that the Cabinet’s policy had failed to prevent or limit purchases of war material by foreign countries, and had tended to stimulate the manufacture of war material in foreign countries, to the detriment, not only of the armament trade, but of the general trade in this country, the Cabinet agreed - (a) To cancel their previous decision 'that the disposal of Government ov/ned arms and munitions of war to foreign states, whether directly or through private contractors, should not be sanctioned.*’ (Cabinet 42 (29), Conclusion 7, and Cabinet 27 (24) Conclusion 5. (b) That in future the three Service Departments should have authority to sanction such sales, unless 3n ary particular case the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs deems them undesirable. (c) That if any difficulty of principle should arise in carrying out this decision, the question should be referred to a Cabinet Committee composed as follows The Secretary of State for Foreign Affajie , (In the Chair), The Home Secretary, The President of the Board of Trade, and the Minster or Ministers at the head of the Service Department or Departments concerned in the particular case. (d)(d) That the wider question of removing obstacles from the export trade of this country in warships and war materials, raised in tne Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty, should be reserved for consideration at a later meeting of the Cabinet, after the return of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Geneva.((o^l ( ic maje sty 1 s G oymimm ) # Copy No. 04 LBJLT.

I am informed by the Gar Office that part of the material required is avallaole for supply from Government surplus stocks, or could oe spared from current Army stocks without replacement being necessitated. It will be recalled that on 9th April 193 c, when the amicable settlement of the dispute between ^enal and Tibet was reported, the Cabinet agreed that the supply of arms to the Nepalese Government, in accordance with treaty obligations, should proceed (Cabinet minute No.21(30)). The treaty in question provides that the Nepalese Government shall be free 00 import from, or through, British India whatever arms and ammunition, ecc., may be required or desired for the strength ana welfare 01 Nepal. The treaty has in the past been interpretaued in a liberal spirit which makes it undesirable to place any impediment in the way of Nepal obtaining the munitions which she requires. oteos are being taken by the Government of Indiao so far as they are able, to supply recent requisitions from the Government of Nepal, but many of the articles requisitioned are not readily available. Meanwhile, the Nepalese Government has been making enquiries for quotations from firms in this country. It appears that, in view of the Cabinet decision of 9th9th April s sales from Government stocks in this country oo firms having contracts with the Government of Nepal nay properly be allowed s notwithstanding the Cabinet decision of 30th October 1929« It is proposed cut I have thought it right to submit to proceed accordingly 5 the circumstances for the information of my colleagues. \ij .B« 2nd June 1930.NEPJ1 A1TP TIBET.

This dispute (arising out of an incident in the course of which the Nepalese Legation at Lhasa was violated by the Tibetans) has now been peacefully settled. r l he Oovernrnent of India have throughout taken the most energetic action to secure this result, and have been laced with great difficulties due to the reluctance of the Dalai Lama to send the apology which the Government of Nepal had the right to expect. Ultimately, on 6th March, the Dalai Lama sent an adequate apology based on a formula suggested to him by the Government of India through Laden La, an officer of Tibetan race in their service whom they sent to Lhasa to facilitate mediation. I circulate two telegrams from the Government of India, one dated 22nd March, stating that the Tibetan communication has been accepted by Nepal, and a further telegram of 26th March repeating an exchange of friendly messages between the Nepalese Prime Minister (Maharaja Sir Bhim Shumshere Jung) and the Dalai Lama. These messages seem to leave no room for doubt that the incident may now be regarded as closed. This result is due in the first place to the manner in which the Government of India used their good offices with both parties. The difficulties of their task and their strenuous and persistent efforts to overcome them are clearly shown in their voluminous correspondence with Nepal and Tibet of which 1 have received copies by every mail. 1 have sent a telegram to the Government of India expressing the appreciation of His Majesty’s Government and congratulating them on the successful outcome of their efforts. In the second place the avoidance of war is due to the patience exhibited by the new Prime Minister of Nepal. I attach copy of a telegram sent to him by the Government of India on 29th January, communicating a message of appreciation of his attitude from the Viceroy. It was suggested to the Government of India in a telegram of 18th February that if the dispute were peaceably settled no time should be lost in supplying to the Nepalese Government such of the munitions for which they had indented as are available in India. (It will be remembered that the supply had been deferred while the dispute remained unsettled.) It was thought that the prompt supply of these munitions after settlement of the dispute would reassure the Nepalese of our determination not to fail in our Treaty obligations, as Nepal expects us to construe them in the light of past practice, and might also give evidence of our moral support of the new Prime Minister. In view of past experience of the fratricidal bloodshed usually attending a succession in Nepal, it is surprising how easily Sir Bhim appears to have established himself, but there are several factors which might tend to make his position unstable. He is new to his office, he succeeds a man of outstanding personality and ability (the well-known Sir Chandra Shumshere Jung), and his attitude of forbearance during the dispute may not have increased his popularity with certain elements among his people.

February 1930. SECRET. C.P. 60 (30). CABINET Sale of Arms and Ammunition to Afghanistan. MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. I invite a reference to Cabinet Minutes Nos. 47 (29) of 13th November, conclusion 9, and 53 (29) of 17tli December 1929, conclusion 6 (6). In the first of these the Cabinet took note that the sale or gift of arms to King Nadir of Afghanistan was not in conflict with their previous decisions on the subject of the sale of arms and ammunition to foreign States, and in the second they agreed that the decision not to dispose of surplus munitions and arms to foreign Governments should not debar a gift by the Government of India to Afghanistan. It appears probable that the Afghan Minister in Loudon may shortly ask for facilities to purchase from War Oflice surplus stocks and to export to Afghanistan the whole or a part of a consignment of 50,000 rifles and 50,000,000 cartridges for which an English firm, Messrs. Fleming, were in negotiations with the War Office in 1928 under instructions from the former Afghan Government. Messrs. Fleming had in 1928 applied for an export licence, and it had been agreed that this might be granted, but the matter lapsed at the time of the fall of King Amanullah’s Government. Messrs. Fleming have recently informed the War Oflice that they expect to receive instructions from the Afghan Minister in London to negotiate the purchase of a portion, at any rate, of the original consignment. desirable that the War Office should be authorised to supply the arms and ammunition which the Afghan Government desire to acquire, and that the Board of Trade should be authorised to grant the necessary export licence. It has been ascertained from the Government of India that they see no objection to the grant of facilities to the Afghan Government to import the arms in question via India, as provided for in the Anglo-Afghan Treaty, 1921. They believe the Afghan Government to be in need of them, and consider that it is in our interest that the first consignment should reach the new Government without delay. 28th February 1930.k. s s. &lt; y / M , /« •/* ^*•*’1 ^**1 ^K. *t t-f/ 'a &lt;&amp;*? tf J* /a** 1 ) ^6u&gt; J „ The arms in question were the first consignment of 'jCjCCC rifles and 50 *GUQ,GCG cartridges v.hich Messrs.

Fleming’s contract is actually a different matter from a gift or sale by the G. of I. But it may be a question whether the principle is not covered by the decision to permit sale or gift by the G. of I. Supposing for example that the G. of I. were to assume liability for payment to the Far Office, the result/vould be the same as a gift by the G. of I. 11 -»There are oertain provisions in the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 which are relevant to purchases by the Afghan Govt, whether from governments or contractors. Article 6 of that Treaty contains the following 'hith regard to arms and munitions, the British Government agrees that as long as it is assured that the intentions of the Government of Afghanistan are friendly and that there is no immediate danger to India from such importation in Afghanistan, permission shall be given without let or hindrance for such importation.' There is also a letter attached to the Treaty which prescribes the procedure to be adopted for the grant of facilities. Copy of this letter is attached. The Treaty provision obliges the G. of I. to allow transit through India; it of course contains no obli 0 ation on the British Government to supply government arms. At the same time King I'adir, if he wishes to tahe up King Amanulla’s contract, would no doubt feel aggrieved if the British Government were to refuse to sell to him arms which they were prepared to sell to King Amanulla, and it might be difficult to explain that our action is not inconsistent./ith the Treaty. At present no definite action has 'been taken on Ilessrs. Fleming’s request but a draft letter (file below) had been prepared which makes no objection to the Afghan Govt, taking up the contract if they wish to do so and if they apply for facilities under the Treaty. The position of the 1.0. in the matter is (I understand from Major Scoones) that these arms are still in the possession of the Govt. / that it was agreed in 1928 to sell them to Messrs. Fleming^, but that the contract has never been completed. It might, therefore, perhaps be held that the Cabinet decision of ^Cth October 1929 does not apply, since the decision of Ipth April 1924 which it reaffirmed was apparently not considered as having retrospective effect, i.e. as applying to contracts already entered into. On the other hand the Y.'.C. might not be regarded as bound by any agreement with Messrs. Fleming in view of the fact that the situation has been changed by the downfall of King Amanulla; this change in the situation, however, does not in itself make it desirable to recede from any agreementjbut rather the contrary.

On Saturday afternoon these papers, with the noting by Mr. Walton, Mr. Wakely and Sir M. Seton, came before the Secretary of State. He instructed me to have put on the Cabinet agenda for to-morrow an item which would give him an opportunity of reporting to the Cabinet the position in regard to the supplies, mentioned in these papers, of munitions to Koweit and Chinese Turkistan. I have drafted the attached note for his use to-morrow covering these two points. The question, however, seems to arise whether the Cabinet should not take into consideration whether their decision of the 30th October is to be held to preclude the supply of arms to Afghanistan; a demand is likely to be made very soon by the new Ruler and, indeed, this contingency has already been under consideration with the Government of India. If so, it would seem desirable to expand the attached note. Attention is invited to C.P.275 below the CabinetNote for Secretary of State for next Cabinet Meeting. The Cabinet on 3Oth October (Minute 7 of the morning meeting, Minute 2 of the afternoon meeting) decided against the disposal of G-overnment- owned arms and munitions of war to foreign s tates. Before the decision was known in the India Office a telegram was despatched on the 1st November, with the prior concurrence of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office and Air Ministry, authorising the G-overnment of India to supply the Sheikh of Koweit ?/ith 100,000 rounds of *303 S.A.A. With the concurrence of the Foreign Office, a telegram had been drafted (but has not yet actually been despatched) authorising the Government of India to supply on payment to the Chairman of the Provincial Government of Hsin-kiang (Chinese Turkestan) his actual requirements in munitions up to a maximum of 10,000 rifles and 5 &gt; 000,000 rounds of ammunition. This supply to the head of the ProvincialProvincial G-overnment has the prior approval of the Nanking Government. In 1924, when the Cabinet took a precisely similar decision on general principles, a very similar difficulty arose at once in regard to the supply of a considerable amount of munitions, including machine-guns and field artillery, to the Afghan Government which, at the moment, was faced with a very serious rebellion in its Eastern Provinces. With the concurrence of the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who was also the Prime Minister, that transaction was allowed to proceed, despite the general decision of the Cabinet and the matter was merely reported to the Cabinet. In 1924 also the Cabinet decision was decided not to have retrospective effect applicable to transactions already entered into before the decision was taken. It is possible that similar questions may arise in the near future as to the supply of arms to the new Government■I Governraent of Afghanistan - not because we shall wish any assistance we may give that Government to take that form, but because Nadir may represent that a supply of arms is one of the first essentials (money being the other) to enable him to establish his pos ition and restore ordered government throughout Afghanistan. Supply would probably have to be by way of gift. It is suggested that such supply need not be regarded as coming within either the spirit or the letter of the Cabinet prohibition. Thatruling would appear to be directed primarily against the sale of surplus munitions by way merely of trade - where the acquisition of the munitions by the foreign government is in itself a matter of indifference to us, or possibly in some degree objectionable. A line can clearly be drawn between such cases and cases in which supply is desirable as a matter of policy. As regards the letter of the Cabinet decision, it might be questioned whether it applies to a gift; and it clearly would not apply to a giftof money with v/hich the foreign government in question rni^ht bu^ the desired arms direct from a British (or other) manufacturer. If the nev/ ruler of Afghanistan considers that he requires arms for the purposes suggested above, we should clearly stand to lose a great deal - friendly feeling, the degree of control that dependence upon British ammunition and supplies confers, and some measure of employment for Britishtrade and industry and if we refused to give any assistance towards his obtaining the desired supplies from British sources. And if he wants the arms urgently (as he probably would ) we might lose almost as much by insisting that, though they might be obtained from British sources, they could not be supplied from Grovernment-owned stocks. On the other hand, we should not be likely to gain anything; if Nadir wqnts the arms, he is not likely to have any real difficulty in obtaining them from other sources - Russia in particular.N Secret.

Active enquiries are now being made from several quarters with a view to the purchase from my Department of surplus arms, especially rifles and machine guns, for ultimate supply to the Chinese Grovernment. I am well aware of the arguments against permitting such sales to take place, but there is another point of view which I wish to take this opportunity of placing before my colleagues in order that a considered decision may be arrived at as to the manner in which these applications should be met. I accordingly attach a memorandum on this question which has been prepared in my Department, bringing out the advantages to be gained by permitting such sales to take place. T. S. 57 8 3489 The War Office, 5th October, 1929. MEMORANDUM BY THE WAR OFFICE. 1. A summary of relevant Cabinet decisions since April, 1924, is attached. (Annexure A.) 2. From the standpoint of broad policy, there are, it is submitted, certain considerations in favour of permitting the sale of surplus munitions to foreign Governments :— (1) The main case for prohibiting these sales presumably lies in the moral value of such a step as a gesture in favour of disarmament. But there appears to be little real virtue in a Government refusing to be a party to the supply of arms to other Governments, when it imposes no limitation of any kind in this matter upon* itself, but continues (as it necessarily must in the absence of an accepted general scheme of international disarmament) to obtain such arms as it desires, both by manufacture in its own factories and by purchase from its own armament firms and, when necessary, from abroad. (2) In any case, such a prohibition can hardly, it is submitted, be regarded as either logical or effective as a moral gesture so long as British armament firms are not prohibited from manufacturing munitions for export to foreign Govern-* merits. Our own sales are insignificant in relation to the transactions of the armament firms, the former having amounted in 6 years only to about £100,000 (apart from £233,000 in respect of a sale of rifles to Afghanistan now likely to prove abortive) while the latter have amounted to £1,828,000 during 1929. On the other hand, to prohibit sales by the armament firms to foreign Governments would leave these firms entirely dependent on British Government orders with the result that, if they did not go out of business altogether, they would either reduce their productive capacity to the minimum needed to meet our peace requirements (thus leaving us without (B19/17) 75 10/29 W.O.P. 4689any reserve capacity to fall back on in case of war), or else would demand heavy subsidies for the maintenance of such capacity, while foreign countries ^ which did not impose a similar restriction would benefit by the orders previously secured by our firms. (3) Prohibition of the sale to foreign Governments of our surplus stocks would not prevent those Governments from obtaining munitions, either from armament firms in this country (unless that also were prohibited) or from other countries. In the absence of an international agreement to adopt a similar policy, the only result of taking this step—apart from such moral significance as it might possess—would be to benefit foreign countries, both in finances and in increased employment, at our own expense. 3. If the above arguments are sound, it follows that, however appropriate it might be to include, as a feature of any scheme of international disarmament, a general prohibition of the sale by the signatory Governments of their surplus munitions, the effect of the British Government binding itself, in the absence of corresponding action by other Powers, by a self-denying ordinance of this kind—unaccompanied by any restriction upon the exporting activities of armament firms in this country or elsewhere, or upon its own power to manufacture such stores or obtain them by purchase either at home or abroad— would merely be to place Great Britain in a disadvantageous position in relation to other Governments, and incidentally to expose it to a charge of inconsistency, without achieving anything in the nature of a really effective gesture on behalf of disarmament. 4. Such a prohibition, moreover, would be far in advance of any international action hitherto contemplated. Two international instruments have, in fact, been drawn up affecting traffic in arms, viz. :— (a) The Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and Implements of War* ; and (b) The Draft Convention with regard to the Supervision of the Private Manufacture and Publicity of the Manufacture of Arms and Ammunition and of Imple ments of War, neither of which seeks to prohibit the sale of surplus warlike stores by governments to other governments. These two instruments are, however, not yet in force. The Traffic in Arms Convention has been signed on behalf of Great Britain, but has not been ratified. The draft Convention on Private Manufacture has not yet been considered by a plenary conference. It would seem inconsistent to reach a decision regarding the sale of surplus warlike' stores which goes further even than would the international agreements themselves, if and when brought into operation. 5. From a departmental point of view, there are important advantages in retaining the power of sale of surplus munitions. (1) Prohibition of sale would entail a considerable financial sacrifice, though one of which it is impossible to give an estimate of any value, in view of the extreme uncertainty of the demand. It is true that, as mentioned above, the amount actually realised since 1923 has not been very large, but the disposable assets include certain items of high potential value ; in particular, e.g., the stock of 1914 rifles, if a purchaser could be found (and several times during the last few years we have seemed to be on the brink of a firm deal), might well realise £1,000,000. Moreover, the cost of storing and caring for stores held as surplus is by no means negligible, and they are subject to continuous depreciation in value, through obsolescence and loss of condition ; the process of breaking them down to a form in which they could be safely marketed as scrap would be extremely expensive. In particular, enquiries have recently been made by contractors (acting for agents of the Chinese Government) whose requirements are— Firm. Rifles. Lewis guns. Ammunition. B.S.A. Guns, Ltd. 100,000 5,000 10,000,000 A. Field &amp; Co., Ltd • •• 2,500 100,000,000 Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co., Ltd.... 350,000 ... 350,000,000 A memorandum by the War Office on this subject is being circulated separately, C.P. 276 (29).It is not known whether these figures are mutually exclusive, but the War Office have large stocks of surplus rifles and Lewis guns which are slowlv depreciating, for the disposal of which this seems an excellent opportunity. Assuming the quantities issued were 350,000 rifles and 5,000 Lewis guns, Army Funds might expect to benefit to the extent of rather over £1,000,000. Apart from the direct receipts from the sale of these arms, their disposal would release valuable storage accommodation and save other expense of storage. Moreover, the sale of these rifles and Lewis guns would mean that the Chinese Government would depend upon Great Britain for ammunition, as it would have to be rimmed and this country has practically a monopoly in the manufacture of this type of ammunition. Thus there would accrue to this country the economic advantage of manufacturing future supplies of ammunition for export to China. With regard to the present demand for ammunition, there would be obvious advantages in meeting it as far as possible and replacing army stocks in so far as it is necessary by manufacture. (2) The prohibition would preclude the sale not only of surplus stores, but also of all army equipment as it becomes obsolete, thus making it impossible to realise receipts which would help to meet the cost of more up-to-date equipment ; with the result that the whole cost, instead of only part of the cost of the latter would have to be met as a new charge. This means that the process of re-equipment would necessarily be retarded, with effects adverse to military efficiency. (3) There is considerable military advantage in inducing foreign armies to adopt armament of British design, as once this has been adopted the power to refuse supplies which cannot be obtained elsewhere if homogeneity of equip ment is to be maintained, presents a potential means of influencing the policy of the country concerned. (4) As the proceeds of the sale of surplus or obsolescent stores would normally assist towards placing orders for new equipment, such sales would pro tanto directly tend to relieve unemployment, since there is no probability that the foreign Governments who are the most likely purchasers of our stores would, if the latter were not on the market, be able to afford to place orders in this country for the corresponding new equipment. In addition a certain amount of additional employment would be likely to accrue in the course of time in the form of orders to Great Britain for replacements and repairs as an indirect result of the adoption by those Governments of equipment of British design. 6. An early decision is requested in view of the demands referred to in paragraph 5 (1), action on which has been suspended pending a decision on the general policy.ANNEXURE A. Summary of Cabinet decisions since April, 1924, in relation to the question of the disposal of surplus warlike stores. 1. On 15th April, 1924, after consideration of a Treasury memorandum on the Control of Sales of Anns, the Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 27 (24), Conclusion 5)— (а) That the disposal of Government-owned arms and munitions of war to foreign States, whether directly or through private contractors, should not in future be sanctioned ; (б) That, as a corollary to the above decision, such superfluous stocks as had not been or could not be made use of by the Service Departments or disposed of to the Dominions, Colonies, &amp;c., should be destroyed. 2. On 25th June, 1924, the Chancellor of the Exchequer circulated a memorandum (C.P. 360 (24)) asking for a decision upon two points of interpretation arising out of the Cabinet decision referred to above :— (a) Was the sale of machine gun parts to Messrs. Vickers, for incorporation in guns to be supplied to Russia, prohibited by the Cabinet decision ? (5) Did the Cabinet decision limit sales to Dominion and Colonial Governments, or were sales in the Dominions and Colonies permissible subject to strict precautions for the prevention of re-export to foreign destinations F 3. On 10th July, 1924, the Secretary of State for Air circulated a memorandum (C.P. 393 (24)) asking for the views of his colleagues regarding a proposed sale of British aircraft (not being surplus Government property) to the Persian Government. 4. On 15th July, 1924, the Cabinet re-affirmed the principles laid down in their previous decision of 15th April, and set up a Standing Committee, composed of the Lord President of the Council, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretaries of State for War and Air, and the President of the Board of Trade, to consider any question referred to it, whether by the Cabinet or by any Government Department, in regard to the interpretation of that decision. (Cabinet 41 (24), Conclusion 7.) 5. On 71st July, 1924. this Standing Committee decided against the sales of machine gun parts to Messrs. Vickers and of aircraft to Persia (paragraphs 2 (a) and 3 above), but agreed to the disposal of munitions to contractors for sale in Dominions or Colonies (paragraph 2 (b)), subject to the Government of the Dominion or Colony being informed and to special precautions against re-exportation. They also ruled that the Cabinet decision was not retrospective, and did not bar the completion of a contract entered into by a Government Department before loth April, 1924, for the sale of arms, &amp;c., to a foreign Government. 6. On 12th November, 1924 (after the change of Ministry), the Cabinet decided that approval should not be given to acceptance by Messrs. Vickers of a contract to supply arms and ammunition to the value of £7,500,000 to the Soviet Government (Cabinet 59 (24)). On 5th January, 1925, after consideration of a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (C.P. 2 (25)), thev re-affirmed the decision not to sanction the equipment of Soviet Russia with munitions of British manufacture, and ruled that it applied to the export of arms already licensed (Cabinet 1 (25), Conclusion 9). On 21st January (Cabinet 3 (25), Conclusion 8), they referred to the President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer the question of compensation to contractors arising out of tbbvdecisioii, and on 1st July (Cabinet 32 (25), Conclusion 12), they decided to refuse the claims for such compensation. 7. On 18th February, 1925, the Cabinet decided, after consideration of a memo randum by the Secretary of State for War (C.P. 15 (2o) )— That the Service Departments should be authorized to take steps to find markets for the surplus and obsolescent equipment amongst the allied and friendly powers either directly or through private contractors who are recognized dealers, and that the decisions of the late Cabinet on 15th April, 1924 (Cabinet 27 (24), Conclusion 5), and 15th July, 1924 (Cabinet 41 (24), Conclusion 7), forbidding the sale of surplus Government arms and munitions to foreign States and ordering their destruction it they could not be made use of by the Services or sold to the Dominions or Colonies, should be cancelled (Cabinet 9 (25), Conclusion 5).8. On 7th August, 1925, the Cabinet decided that proposals to grant applications for export licence covering a period longer than 3 months (where the Service Depart ments, the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade were agreed that they were not open to objection) should not be acted upon until they had been laid before the Cabinet. (Cabinet 44 (25), Conclusion 12). 9. On 19th January, 1926, the Cabinet agreed that the decision of 12th November, 1924, prohibiting the supply of war material to Kussia should be reconsidered in cases where the war material was of a purely defensive character (Cabinet 1 (26), Conclusion 5) ; and on 29th January, they decided to allow Messrs. Vickers to supply that country with small coast defence vessels and submarine mines. (Cabinet 2 (26), Conclusion 6). 10. At various dates in 1927 and 1928 the Cabinet agreed to the grant of long term licences :— (a) To B.S.A. Guns Ltd., for warlike stores to Japan, (5) To Nobel Industries Ltd., for warlike stores to Yugo Slavia, (c) To Nobel Industries Ltd., for ammunition to Turkey, with an intimation in each case that the licence would not be withdrawn save in the event of circumstances of an altogether exceptional character arising which the Board ol Trade are at present quite unable to foresee.” (Cabinet 18 (27), 36 (27), 20 (28), Conclusions 17, 9 and 16, respectively.).a in / 5 URG^T. AIR 11 III IS TRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KI1TGSV/AY, V/.C .2. 9th August, 1924, © Dear Wakeley, Burnett tells me that there are some further t developments as regards the supply of machines to Afghanistan of which the Air Ministry may expect to he formally notified hy the India Office in the near future. I think he also mentioned to you the hearing upon this question of the recent Cabinet decision in regard to the sale of armaments and ammunition. That decision is no 'doubt available to you but for convenience I enclose a copy • • * « / of it. It seemed to us, having regard to paragraph (b), that the decision really applied only to the disposal of • • the large stocks of surplus arms, etc. which were in existence; and this conclusion is I think borne out by the Treasury memorandum C.P.233/24 on which the decision 9 ♦ • « ' y was based. I would add that this memorandum, to which you may wish to refer, proceeded mainly from the financial aspect of the iniquity and folly of small indebted States' plunging into further unreproductive expenditure on armaments. However the decision stands and the Cabinet Standing Committee on the sale of arms and ammunition at their meeting on July 31st held that it precluded the proposed sale of some service aircraft by the Royal Air Force to the Persian Government, I notice at the same time that the Committee agreed that the Cabinet decision could not be considered to take effect retrospectively, and that in the event of any Government department having entered into a contract for the disposal of arms to Foreign States L.D. Wakely Esq., ■ IITDIA OFFICE. priorf m * 5 prior to that decision such a contract should he completed. It is clear that the present proposal for the supply of machines 4 to Afghanistan was on foot 'before April 15th 19^4 hut it would, so far as the information in our possession goes he difficult to argue that the non-retrospective application of the decision could he extended sufficiently to cover the present proposal, XX XX ¥ours sincerely, (Sd, ) G ,G.Evans. « t \ t P,S.

(24 )3, also C.P. 293(24), in which certain arguments were, put forward in favour of granting the request of the Persian Government to be allowed to purchase British machines. It was also urged that such action would not be inconsistent with the Cabinet decision of loth April 1924, which it was suggested, applied only to surplus stocks . Conclusions . THE COMMITTEE agreed - That the sale of aircraft by the Royal Air Force to the Persian Government was prohibited by the Cabinet decision of 15th April, 1924 and could not be authorised. (3) The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War relative to the supply of certain spare parts already promised to the Esthonian Government, (S .A.A.

The Esthonian Minister\ V I * V 1 in London had 'been informed that the spare parts could he supplied and the transaction was practically concluded before the Cabinet decision of 15th April 1924, had been t a 2 en. * . . i, _ - • Conclusions. THE COMMITTEE agreed - (a) That, in view of the fact that the &lt; negotiations for the transaction had been inforaied that the spare parts &lt;could be . . supplied prior to the Cabinet decision on 15th April 1924, the sale of the spare parts as shown in the list Marked A, ''attached to the War Office letter under consideration, might be proceeded with. (b ) That the Cabinet decision of the 15th April 1924, could not be considered to take effect retrospectively and that in the event of- any Government Department having entered into a contract for the disposal of arms and munitions of war to Foreign States prior to that decision, such a contract should be completed. t ‘ V , V. • i » • •EXTRACT ?Ra: CABIITiiiT 27 (24), (APRIL 15.1924 ) SALES OF ARLIS AITL A..LIUMITI 01 T.
