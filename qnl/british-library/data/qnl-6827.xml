I have the honour to submit the supplementary agreement (in original with translation) concluded with the Idrisi. I also forward herewith a memorandum on this agreement which has been drawn up at my request by Lieu tenant-Colonel II. F. Jacob. 2. I trust that the agreement will meet with the approval of His Fxcellency the Viceroy and His Majesty’s Government. The main object of the agreement, as set forth in paragraph III., has been secured, and without making further concessions than, as brought out in the memorandum, the situation required. 3. It must be recollected that the-Idrisi is now in a very difficult irame of mind. The Kunfida affair still rankles dee]) ; the rapidity of our action in Favasan is to him uncalled for and unintelligible, and our comparative inaction in Arabia is misunderstood. Fixed, too, is his conviction that when peace is concluded the old friendship of England and 1 urkey will secure for the latter very favourable terms, and allow her to concentrate her power against her present Arab enemies. 4. Extreme patience, ready appreciation, and great knowledge of the Arab were required in effecting this agreement. All were fully displayed by Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob, and I am glad to have this opportunity of bringing his services to notice. I have, &amp;c., J. M. Stewart, Major-General, Political Resident, Aden. Aden Residency, q gQ 26th January 1917.

MEMORANDUM ON THE CONCLUDED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTARY IDRISI SAIYH) ON ENGAGEMENT 22xi) JANUARY 1917. In this engagement with the Idrisi it may appear at first sight that we have given more than the occasion demanded. The truth is that the Idrisi refused point blank to admit the really essential paragraph III. without his counter-proposals being added. It is necessary to understand his attitude. The Idrisi does not know how the war will end. Last year he was certain the Allies would win. He is less hopeful now. Then, he feared we might patch up a peace which left the Turks “ in situ ” as his implacable foes : to-dau, he looks round and seesthem very much to the fore in Arabia and holding their own. lie cites Lahej, Kunfida and the failure there; the slow progress of the Sherif of Mecca, and finally Mesopotamia, and lie doubts our ability to dislodge them. His fears to-day are two-fold. He believes that— (1) his refusal to treat with any other Power, and his promise not to dispose of Farasan Islands and rights therein, will draw upon him Turkish animosity. The Turks up to now have watched his coquetry with us but believe they can win him back to the fold hereafter. Let them once come to know of his closer “ ' with us as regards the Islands and they will regard him as completely ostracised. There is no arguing with a fanatic of such preconceived notions ; (2) this engagement will deprive him of future assistance in arms and ammunition from Djibouti and Massowa, both of which places have for many years very considerably assisted in the arms traffic. Cut off from these two sources of supply to whom; he asks, should he apply for the necessary sinews of war, and whom should he approach hereafter except the British Government ? The Government must therefore take the place of these two Powers. The sole Power the Idrisi fears now, and after the war, is Turkey aided by Germany, and the reason given for securing not only our pnomise of assistance in arms, but of advice in the development of his country, an asvlum—should a crisis in the country compel his temporary withdrawal— coupled with the assurance of a continuation of these terms after the war to himself and successors—is this one inordinate fear of a prospectively irate Turkey. From this obsession he could not be dissuaded. At first it was our flac/ that would incense the Turks, and on the second visit it would be the engagement to refrain from a cession of the Islands that was bound to arouse Turkish resentment. At one time in the proceedings the Idrisi had insisted on the despatch of British troops inland, if he were attacked by the Turks, but I reminded him that cur earlier treaty was con lined to his sea-board and to protection by sea power. 1 may say that although this engagement in its inception was peculiar to the Farasan Islands, yet the Idrisi was loud in predicting for the whole of his territories the ill-forebodings he had conjured up as the likely result t&gt;f his agreeing to paragraph III. It was therefore not possible—given the desideratum of securing his adhesion to this paragraph—to exclude from the agreement this extended area of his entire sea-board. His Minister (Ba Sabi) declared (and we cannot refute it) that the Farasan Islands were . . the Idrisi’s before the 30th April 1915, 1 and that, though not specincally men tioned, the Farasan became at once a part and parcel of his sea-board and within the purview of that treaty. One result of the present agreement will be the exclusion of Italian influence in the Idrisi’s domains. His Minister told me that the Italians were very desirous of concluding some agreement with the Idrisi to secure a (/uid pro quo of their long established connection qwi the arms trade, and that even now the Italians sent him ammunition. At the same time the Idrisi scouted the idea of dealing with any Power save Great Britain, and to our Government be looked for every form of assistance. As regards paragraph V. 1 found it impolitic to insist on any fixed number of his retainers on the Island. I had insisted on “ a number not less than one hundred men,” but this was met by the argument that many more might be required and the exact number had best be left to time and circumstance. The Minister who was deputed on board said that the Farasan Islanders were a very stout body of men who would give a good account of themselves if necessary. 1 waived the point of numbers for I was dealing with a peculiar cast of man, and was guided also by the principle that (^specially with Asiatics, L it unwise to insist on what one cannot enforce nor supervise without causing friction. It is enough that he has engaged to ensure his ellecti\ e occupation.At our first meeting the Idnsi could not understand whose intei\on c we fen red It could not be an enemy, for we surely had control of the Ived Sei outlets. As for allies, were then- not our friends ? If they interfered- m-if we would anticipate such a contretemps we should tell them that the islands were Idrisi, seized by him from the enemy, manned by him, and his Hag hoisted, to show his occupation, and, finally, that he was under Bn mi Pr0t Such announcement seems to me very essential. 1 am not aware of any future eut-and-dried division of the several interests m the Red Sea, bin it had occurred to me that to hoist our flag and to land our troops would savour of British occupation and place these islands facto within the category T .»i fc—tSSw 1'!' ««* piaectioii alter peace is concluded is very problematical, if at all possible. The Idrisi would not sign the English copy. It was unreasonable, he said to si-n what vou cannot understand. He however retained both Arabic and English copies. 1 did not press him to comply. His case is a peculiar The a-reement was concluded and signed, after much cross role re nee, on the evening of the 22nd instant, and ll.M.S. Mmlo was asked by wireless telegraphy on 23rd idem to remove troops and Hag, which he did that same da^. -vr tt at o 7&gt; ,.t i l would thank Commander G. Arnot, 1 i..n. 11., ll.M.S. 1 erth, and Lieutenant L. P. Nalder, R.N.V.R., the Political Officer of the Southern Red Sea Patrol, for their cordial co-operation in dealing with the Idrisi. lie is the most suspicious and the most exclusive individual of his class 1 have ever encountered in Arabian polities. A give-and-take policy was indicated, as he himself was only too ready to remind me. (Signed) JI. F. -Tacob, Lieutenant-Colonel, H MS.
