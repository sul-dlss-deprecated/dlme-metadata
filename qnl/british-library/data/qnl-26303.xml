PRCVISIOK OP lilGHT FIYi;.G PACIIITISSc — (Brief explanatory note oreoarstory to Inter-'Dcpartmenta 1 Conference orooosed to be held at the Air Ministry on Friday,, March 22 v 1935 at 3 pciru) The fiJmoire Air Mail Scherre depends for its successful development on the early orovision of full niftht flyinor facilities over the main trunk routes&lt;&gt; As a first instalment* it is desired to initiate immediate action for the eouioment of the route between Cairo and Calcutta so that night flying can commence over that sector early in 1936* Such a situation will be an essential oreliminary to the full development of the ground organisation over the remainder of the routes in time for the progressive reduction of journey schedules visualised under the schemeo At the same time 0 it aooears desirable that the Governments of Egyot* D alestine and Iraq should now be invited to oarticipate in the scheme by agreeing to air transoort by the Empire Services of all their first class moil matter to and from the countries who are included in the scheme.. In view of the short distances between this country and Egypt* n aiestine and Iraq in comparison with the average distances of the other oarbie to the scheme, there clearly aooears to be no case for requesting a subsidy from these three Governments* beyond an attempt to secure a payment equivalent to the housing and landing fees which will be payable by Imperial Airways for use of the ground organisation* couoled with exemption for the Company from payment of taxes on fuel and oilc. It may, however, prove to be impracticable to secure both reasonable lump sum ocstal payments from these Governments and also subsidy contributionsequivalent to the housing and landing fees; and this ooint r;ill need to he keot in rind in deterrining the minimum oostal osyment? which will be acceotable from the three countries * If this offer of oarticioation in the scheme could be made immediately* it would greatly facilitate a collateral request that urgent action should be taken towards the urovision of the night flying facilities required under the scheme* The matter is so urgent, that the Air Ministry feel it essential that a small party should proceed, if possible at the end of Aoril* to negotiate in these three countries with a view to securing agreement and initiating immediate actionv If this is not done* there will be inevitable delays and serious danger of failure to secure the co-operation of these Governments in a matter ?. T hich is of the utmost imoortance for the future of the Smoire scheme* It is suggested* therefore, that the Inter-DeoartmentaX Conference should consider the desirability of arrangements being made to this end; and it is hoped that the D ost Office will consider the possibility of nominating a representative to deal with the oostal side of the negotiations., The remaining members of the oarty should comprise, it is suggested, an officer from the Air Ministry authorised to negotiate terms for the provision of the ground organisation and a settle??ient of the questions attendant on oayment of housing and landing fees and exemption from duties on oetrol and oil,, together with a technical officer from the Civil Aviation Department* As a oreliminar:^ to su&lt;h visits, it is further suggested that H&lt;,MoRepresentatives In the three countries should be Informed of the position in general terms andrequested to ascertain and reoort by telegraph whether such visits v/ould be welcomeo A tentative draft oi a meinorandurfi outlining the position for transmission to Hn. *. Reoresentatives is attached hereto* The draft would require slight adjustments for the three cases 9 and a schedule aoorooriate to each country would be aopended, giving derails of the orovision which aopears to be desirable and the probable cost* These schedules will be available for consideration at the meeting on March ?2 y if desired,. In general it may be stated that the total caoitsl cosu is estimated at £8,0f0 for ^gyoty and h?8$0 (. for Iraq ft case of Palestine is comolicated somewhat by the fact that arrangements are understood to be already in contemolation for new airports at i ydda and Haitaj, which wxll largely meet the situation* combined with certain intermediate beacons v which it is believed can be obtained without difficulty by arrangements with the Cil Companies,. There remains* however, the problem of whether Gaza should be retained as a norfc of call and* if so s . whether additional equipment will not be necessary to the extent of £6,cr0v In addition* there is the question of Transjordania* where equioment is required to the value of roughly £lC y OOC&lt;, It should be observed, parenthetically, that these estimates costs are necessarily somewhat Hypothetical at this stage o Reliable estimates can only be formulated in the light of discussion of the requirements on the spot,. The case of Transjordania will clearly call for acceptance by the Air .Ministry of the major responsibility for the cost, having regard to the conditions obtaining in that country- Similarly the Air Ministry will need to meet the cost of the facilities between Basra and Gwadar s where India take over responsibility* It v:ill howeverbe necespary for early arrar»f?er , enfcs to be made for ^uch 7.'ork to be put In hand and for aome oooortunity to be afrorded r~\ for the Air Tinistry technical reoresentative to get in touch with the n o!itical Resident on the Persian Gulf on the one hand^ and the Transjordan authorities on the other* It is booed that some means of achieving this can be formulated at the prooosed Inter-Departmental meeting * It also aooears desirable to indicate the oasis which the Air Ministry have in mind for meeting the difficulties likely to be apprehended in dealing with the Sgyotian and Iraq Governments* Clearly&lt;, the caoitaj 'best v;ili be a difficulty and it may be necessary to offer an advance lump sum payment, to cover an agreed proportion of the fifteen years' payments which would be due from Imperial Airways in resoect of their user of the ground facilities during the period of the scheme,. In this way, the principle would be preserved of requiring the local Government to acceot responsibility for provision of the ground organisation, whilst they would be able to recover corresponding Payments from other national comoanieso It is hoped at the same time to secure seme adjustment on similar lines of the present position whereby the Meteorological organisation of the R«. A.P . in Iraq does work for the Iraq Government {viz&lt;&gt; for the Iraq Air Force and the civil aviation of that country) and also affords facilities to other national companies, apart from Imperial Airways« The total value of such services is estimated at '4,000 Ova*; and, nrima fecie 9 a case exists for arguing that the Iraq Government should assume responsibility for the service* If they desire to continue to avail themselves of our services, then they should make the payment of £4,0^0 DnO, and recover from the various Parties c otic or ned5 pjive d. general outlineo It is hooed that the Inter Deoartmentol Conference ray he able to formulate detailed recommendations to regulate the nrocedure and ensure early action- It will be aopreciated that the issues involved are somewhat eomolex and that this note cannot do more tn-tP.DR/FT lyiK^ORAflLUi,:.

In pursuance of this policy, it is contemplated to intensify the organisation, to speed-up the iournev schedules, and to increase the frequency and capacity of the services. The scheme, in fact, involves a step forward in the development of long-distance air services which will for the first time make it possible to secure all the advantages of air transport for iirst clasp mail, without any serious financial disadvantage« It v.'ill be obvious that such a scheme can offer exceptional opportunities to countries, located along the routes and not themselves operating air services 0 It is hoped, therefore that the Government of will favourably consider the possibility of entering into arrangements with the Government oi the Tinited kingdom tox the transport under this scheme of all their 1irst class mail to and from all other countries within the scope of the scheme. It is suggested that a suitable basis would be the payment of an inclusive lump sum payment per annum overf- period of fifteen years, this period beirjj’; the hiniimi:* vhioh will suffice to give the operating authorities a sufficient security of tenure to v-nrr^nt the exceptional financial outlay and risxs which the scheme will entiilc The scheme ofj'ers such financial terns ar should enable the lur;o sum payments to be Kept within liir;itr. which will ijreclucle any substantial increase in the normal postal rate 0 The full details are elaborated in the printed oiemo rand urn, encloses herewith, although it is realised that this is not in a for. suitable for direct presentation to the Government of a country outside the British Km pi re u In addition to- the Krupire Governments served by the routes, the Governments of the Guclan, Pigypt, Palestine ana In^i nre being invited to participate« It is ? however an inevitable corollary of the Scheme that the various participating Governments should, as indicated in the printed memorandum, accept responsibility for providing adequate night flying facilities unci all other adjuncts for an efficient ground organisation, to ensure the successful application of the proposals. It will be obvious that the journey time schedules can only be achieved, if night flying is fairly continuous unless machines are to be used which provide an exceptionally high rate of speed and give longer periods upon the ground, His I ajesty’s Government, however, as the result of an exhaustive review of the whole situation, are convinced that excessively high speeds can be purchased at too dear a price, for instance, if the average cruising speed under the Kcheme were to be increased to 200 miles per hour (as is within the limits of technical practicability;: the total costs involved would be increasedby more than The difficulty i? th^ut c.achines operating at very high speeds have to be fitted 'vith fuselages of relatively small cross-section, with the inevitable result that the standard cf comfort in so 1 o ri as to entail undue fatigue by long periods of Hying. . ith machines of large capacity (roughly tour tens pay load.) operating at 150 m.o.h., it is possible, however, to use a fuselage so roory ar to give a high standard of comfort, roughly equivalent to that of ' agcns-Lit M , and so provide full sleeping accorriodation and such arrange ments ar will preclude any possibility of serious fatigue by practically continuous flight. The various Governments of the British Kmpii'e are accepting responsibility for the ground organisation of the sections of the routes within their territories and the Government of the United Kingdom would therefore as^ that the suggestion to the Government of that they should avail themselves of trie fchene for the transport of their own first-clasr mail, should be coupled with the request that they will unaertuie the provision of\ the necessary ground organisation within their territories. It is realised that such arrangements B.re already accepted by them in principle and that facilities for day flying exist to jue't the needs of the various national companies subject to reasonable payment for such services in the form of landing and housing fees It is, nevertheless, the case at present that the facilities available are not adequate for continuous night flying, ana the Government of the United Kingdom attach exceptional importance to ensuring that the route betweenLondon ti nd Calcutta shall be available for night flying within the next twelve months« Such an arrange Lie nt is not only desirable Iron the present general standpoint of the developr.ent of world aviation, but is called for ar a necessary preliminary to the development of the main scheme for the Frnpire Air Routes ar from 1937« It appears essential to get this first phase of the Scheme in full development during 1936, leaving the further development of the routes to South Africa ana beyono Calcutta to follow us quickly as possible. In the circumstances, the Government of the TTnited Kingdom would as a the Government of to consider the possibility of providing the facilities set out in the Schedule attached hereto which appear to them to be the minimum which would suffice to meet the situation. They feel great diffidence in putting forward such a suggestion as to the facilities which should be provided, but do so in the hope that the Government of will appreciate their desire to assist consideration of the matter to the utmost. The Government of the United Kingdom would further suggest that the matters dealt with herein would be greatly facilitated if a small party of official experts from the Air Ministry and the Post Office were to visit in the near future with a view to discussing the financial and technic spot, as soon as the Government of have had an opportunity of considering the proposals tentatively outlined herein.I n •.'argiruil Note. Thin punsage would require suitable aioend- iLent iri the case of Palestine to allow for the provision already approved v-,t Lydda and Haifa,, To Kgypt and Iraq only c ■ o J’igypt only 0 It is possible that the Government of the United Kingdom might, if necessary, be able to facilitate the immediate provision of any necessary equipment by making an advance payment in respect of a portion of the landing tmci housing fees which wcula accrue from Imperial Airways over the period of fifteen years suggested above as appropriate for the Postal Agreement. It will be obvious, hov/ever, that the payment of landing and housing fees is a necessary item in preparing the schedule of operating costs of any such scheme ana that, therefore, the postal payments proposed would include some element in respect of such costs* This point is mentioned as having some relevance to the final consideration of the whole project although it is realised that it would be necessary for such payments to be made by Imperial /irways in view of the need for preserving equality of treatment as between them and the operating companies of other countries* In the case of the Egyptian and Iran Governments, it appears to be a question whether useful reference might not be naoe to the value of the provision of such ground facilities in connection with the Air Eorces of those countries and their internal civil av iat ion «, The above proposals no not cover meteorological questions. These will similarly require consideration, but the problems arising in Egypt can only be dealt with in the light of the facilities which it may be possible to establish in the Eudun. It is desired therefore to postpone consideration of this aspect for the time being.© r j?o Irrjq only. The above proposals do not cover meteorological questions 0 At present such services are provided by tne organisation in Iraq; but it appears necessary that any discussion of ground organisation should review the situation in connection with these meteorological services, having regard to the fact that use is made of them ny the Iraq government J'or its own Air Force and civil aviation, whilst other national companies in addition to Imperial Airways have hitherto been given the facilities, although they properly fall to be provided by the Iraq Government e The matter could doubtless be best dealt with in the course of the general discussion* The Government of the United Kingdom are extremely anxious that there may be no delay in dealing with the problems briefly reviewed in this memorandum and they would appreciate an early intimation that the proposed visit of experts rill be acceptable at a date, if possible, not later than the beginning of gay next.mamTel.
