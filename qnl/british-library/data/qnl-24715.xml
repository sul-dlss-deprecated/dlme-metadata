Commissioner for Iraq., Baghdad* To Political Resident, i5ushire* Unnum'bered. Rated (and received ) 18th October 1929. m^SDIATB. Follov/ing is repetition of telegram from His Hajesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, jmo. 314, dated the 16th October 1929 begins Ibn Saud has decided to base at Qatif his air unit(s) on the Persian Gulf* He has asked that four aero- planes, which he is purchasing from stock in Iraq, should be sent to Qatif. It is proposed v/hen balance of purchase price has been paid that the machines should be flown from Iraq to Qatif carrying the British pilots, who are being engaged by Bin Saud* A more unobtrusive method of delivery would have been preferred by me as less likely to annoy King Faisal and the Iraq Government; but 1 am advised that delivery by sea is rendered impracticable by the complete lack of landing facilities at IJatif* Delivery by sea would moreover involve considerable delay. it would pro bably also be necessary to despatch special party to re assemble the aeroplanes at Qati&lt;f, and their departure might attract even moi-e attention than the departure by air of the aeroplanes. In fact 1 doubt whether anything would be gained by attempting to conceal the real destination of the aero planes which would doubtless leak out later. i am therefore inclined to think that the best course would be to inform the Government of Iraq quite frankly of the sale of machines to King Bin Saud and of the arrangements contem plated for their delivery. If you agree you should inform the Iraq Government accordingly. if necessary you will, of course, make use of the point that if His Majesty’s Government had refused to sell. Bin Saud would undoubtedly have- 2 - have purchased aircraft elsewhere and would have employed non-British pilots who mij^it not have respected the frontier of Iraq, so scrupulously as British pilots can he relied upon to do.

Matter of proposed sale of aeroplanes to Ibn 3aud was openly discussed in Kuwait a week ago with this difference that the pilots were to be lent by the Air Porce. Bin Saud has obviously been spreading this propaganda openly, as the news first reached luwait from the Awazira tribe together with a story that Jubail not Qatif was to be the base. I have not seen copy but I believe that one of the Mesopotamian papers published details about a week ago. POLITICAL AGENT. Post copy to the Political Agent, Bahrain, Sd/- C.C.J.Barrett. Lieut-Col.

Sit uation at Qatig . As I read it Qatif is at the mercy of the rebels any time they choose to attack it. xhey have not done so yet because they wish to retain their field mobilization and not outheir strength by attacks on town. When aeroplanes for Bin Saud arrives they are sure to invite immeaiate attack unless, in the meantime, the situation rauically changes or His Majesty can send strong force to protect them. Any aerodrome chosen will have to be on desert side of palm belt some town and in vulnerable position. I thifek that Hoffuf would be more suitable and also much healthier from Ibn Baud's point of view. From personal knowledge there is a superb site for landing ground west of town commanded by Qalat Khsam. In the above connection please see eight maps, sketched oy me/^ho Ojair, Qatif ana Hoffuf areas, which are in Subzabad offioe. Only difficulty I can foresee regarding suggested reconnaissance is: danger of landing in ; t atif ftarboui' at c low water where numerous shoals render operation difficult. Obviously arrival of flying boat will be warning of what is to follow: for this reason I suggest better plan would be for reconnaissance to proceeu to Bahrein and visit Qatif from there f by sea.

His expert, knowledge of the tribal situation was needed for the intermediate landing ground only, rhere was no intention of sending him to poach in your preserves as you think. It is difficult to explain everything by telegram. As you know a very large portion of this Pesidency’s work is done by telegraph, and as certain pieces of in^omation and certain telegrams only which affect Political Agents more intimately are repeated to them in an attempt to keep there posted as far as possible, misunderstandings occasionally occur.

Oonfidential 25th November i929. From The Political Agent Bahrein. 3 To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir I have the honour to submit the following report upon my cruises with the Flying Boats. In accordance with your instructions I left on the ilth November for Darin. Wing Commander Howe and Wing Commander K.C. Buss, the Officer in Charge of the ’Iraq R.A.F. Intelligence were in the party as well as Squadron Leader Fullard of Air Force Head quarters Baghdad. It was intended that we should proceed to Darin where we were expected, but we went instead to Qatif, and anchored there. Itook the opportunity to call on the Amir, who had not replied to my letter suggesting that I should pay a visit to qatif (doubtless not having received a reply from Bin Saud) and after some delay, he received us. 2. The Amir seemed unaccountably nervous, possibly due to our unexpected arrival, and was apologetic* for the lack of preparation and enquired how long we pro posed to stay. I had sent my interpreter over from Bahrein the night before, and he now came in with Abdul Aziz Qusaibi, having come by launch from Darin. We therefore took leave of the Amir and returned to Darin which we had flown over on the outward journey, by flying boat. 3 . We anchored off the aerodrome, which is on the mainland side of Darin, in deep water, and went ashore on donkeys as the shallows extend for nearly* * * a quarter of a mile. The Qusaihis had lunch waiting for us, and the aerodrome was then examined. Apart from the fact that they had enclosed it with high fence, and that the corneis were marked with pillars instead of flat triangles the Boyal Air Force officers considered it a very creditable effort on the part of the amateurs, and they decided to leave it where it was after marking larger boundaries in the direction of the prevailing wind. Huts had been built for the pilots who are to come, completely fitted with beds and bedding, and a large petrol and bomb store had been built on the sea shore and hangars. 4. We were asked to stay the night, but I had much to do and Wing Commander Howe considered the anchorage of the flying boats very exposed ( a 25 knot wina was blowing) and so we returned to Bahrein. The Wing Commander and one flying boat returned next day to make further observations, but since they were not going to Qatif, and I was anxious to be away from Bahrein as little as possible, I did not accompany them. They returned in the afternoon without incident.will be of use, for there is much that can be more conveneintly dealt with in a D.O. 2. From the political point of view, the trip was not a great success owing the the continual embarrassments provided by the R.A.F. At the very start, when we set out for Darin there was no question of our going to Qatif, nor did I want to visit^among a mob of other people• As we passed Darin, the aerodrome was clearly visible, and we passed a launch obvious ly intended for us which, in addition, waved to attract our attention, but the pilot of the leading plane for reasons which we were unable to fathom either then c^r afterwards, flew to Raxin Qatif and anchored there. We had to follow suit, and since we had arrived I felt it was impossible to go without seeing the .Amir. 3. Hassan Q.usaibi who was in my plane was suspicious of our intentions but went word on for us, and gave us cofiee in the Customs, a wrteched place. After considerable delay I was told the Amir was ready. He received us in a very hast ily adorned mejlis, and with much nervousness inquired our move ments. Buss ( did you know they were sending the head ol their Intelligence down here ? ) thought that his conscience must be pricking him, but I am certain it was nothing but this unexpec ted incursion of Ferangis v/hich upset him. Hot realising that some present understood English some of our party made comments on our surroundings which must have certainly been re tailed after we had gone. 4. During lunch an amusing incident occurred. Howe feeling that something must be said about the really very credi table lunch provided, turned to Hassan §usaibi who was sitting but not eating with us, and said * Jiatfesth Hatha moo zain ’ * this is not good f and pointed at the food.2Page 2. sulky when we he became his on the beach, to the lagoon and Buss and I looked incredulously at each other, and Hassan f s face was a study, till Buss said 1 what did you mean to say 1 and we were then able to explain that he had meant the opposite. You will notice that Kassan was not eating with us. Had I been alonp he would have. 5. The Q,usaibis were very disturbed 'Whart' we should hear somthing different to the propaganda they dish up in Bahrain, and ^ere particularly nervous of my Interpreter Sayyid Abdur Rezzaq. They were not pleased that we should hear the masons working on the petrol store grumble that they had not been §*aid for three weeks, and anybody who might conceivably say anything interesting was kept well away. 6. I found Shaikh Shakhboot thoroughly arrived at Abu Dhabi, but after an hours talk usual cheerful self. Then I went for a walk the flying boat moved, v/ithout v/arning, round a mile away to be out of the wind. I came back and found him and his uncle sitting on the beach glowering, and muttering that 'the plane would be shot up by bedu and that they would be held responsible'. Next day, had I had time, something might have been done but I could not get him away from his relatives. It is hopeless trying to do anything in these flying visits, they only unsettle the people and do no good at all. 7/hat is wanted is a stay of at least two days, and to go out hawking with him or shooting, and then after suitably insulting him with a rifle or other useful gift, there is some hope of get ting him to do what one wants. Also one has to find out which relatives count and talk them over, and it all takes time. If we try and force him him in this instance we shall make a great mistake, and anynpoints that we lose in the game will be thank fully collected by our ally Bin Saud. He is a menace and noth- else to our power on the Trucial Coast. 7. Yhy we stopped at Hamriyah I could not discover, there is no lagoon and it is useless for the R.A.i 1 . though Shaikh is very f]]rn\ed-ly* Howe has no idea what a nuisance flying boats are to everyone, and thought our arrival would treat for the Shaikh. He was away paying a call at Dibai. ing a for the the be I persuaded them not to stop the night at Urn-el-Q,aiwain, as the Shaikhs would have sat up half the night wondering whether they should send us guards or feed us or what we wanted. I do not consider that the Trucbal Coast is yet in a condition when io-up— hazard cruising by the R.A.F. is likely to be useful, or in fact anyl^ting but what it is now 8. The night at Sir Abu Hair was morning both Howe and Fullard asked me ii to bathe, and I told them that they could not bathe in potential danger, uneventful, it would be but next all righght front o f We went to the other side of the spit but after the bathe Fullard felt he need- ran a quarter of a mile along the beach in his The fishermen must have thought him mad. Q.atar the difficulties of paying political visits off the fishermen naked, where there was cover, ed exercise and bi?rhday kit At ~ from a plane reached, their climax. The fat son Hamdd Co,me to see me, and as there was no place outside I asked him in. Coming in,he stuck in the pilots seat, and I thought to help him by pulling his leg, and Abdul Rezzaq by pressing out ! on his head- but he was trying all the time to get out.' However, he got in at last, and promptly lent back against some oily wires. of the crew was preparing lunch and I suddenly thought tha1T n one must have been affected by the water at Sir Abu Hair and looked hastily round, and found that the dreadful smell issued from a tin of Brussel sprouts he had just opened. The Shaikh broke out into a profuse sweat, and I hastily said that and s^e the forxt. We got him left for the shore. Later him if he would like a short I thought I should like to come out with some difficulty and he when returning his call I asked flight and he excused himself. 9. The fact is that on these trips one feels that one is leading a pack of of embarrasment at children a minute * about, who may produce any kind s notice. As a conveyance for2 • c Page 3.

A short trip is pleasant a long one makes one feel sick and dizzy, and I was much comfor ted to find that Pul lard was affected the same way. The dim ness takes a day to wear off, but it would take much more to is- courage one from accompanying them for apart from the adventure I am convinced that their kaHwiedgst ignorance of local condition^ and customs will lead to trouble sooner or later unless someone is within reach to Keep them out of Yours sincerely rCONFIDENTIAL No 0 631 Fr am Lieutenant-Colonel H*R.F # Diokson, C.I.Eo, Politioal Agent, Kuwaito To The Hon f hie the Politioal Resident in the Persian Culf, Bushire 0 Letter from Al-Duwish re aeroplanes Sir I have the honour to forward English Translation of a letter dated 6th Jamad XI, 1348 ( 8th November 1929) from Shaikh Faisal al-Duwish, the leader of the Akhwan forces now in rebellion against H.M.King Bin Saud which, is of interest. The letter reached me on 11th November 1929 the day after the writer led his forces away to Hafar al- Batin# 2. The wording of al—Duwish’s letter is merely another way of showing that he is still desperately anxious to be on friendly terms with H.M’s Government. This he has alraady intimated on several occasions in the past six months. His quaint request that our aero planes should not fly over his peopled heads in com pany with Bin Saud , s machines (when the latter materia lize) seems reasonable from the Bedouin point of view. In this connection doubtless H.M»s Government will already have arranged with Bin Saud for the painting of the Nejd device underneath of the wings of his mechines, as apart from al-Duwish 1 s request it will be desirable for everyone in these parts to know exactly how to differentiate between British aeroplanes and those of Bin Saud« 3 I have not replied to Shaikh Faisal al-Duwish*sletter, nor do I consider a reply necessary as Ms • ' ^ ^ letter after an is eouohed in the form of a Notice* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W Lleut-Colo, Political Agent, Kuwait,Translation of a letter From - Faisal bin Sultan ad-Duwish© To - The Political Agent, Kuwaito Dated 6th Jamadi II, 1340 ( 8th Norember 1929)* After compliments, been We hare/lnfonned that Ihn Saud has bought some aeroplanes for himself, therefore we are anxious to make It dear to you that, should any aeroplanes come over us we must assume them to b dong to Ibn Saud, and no doubt we shall be compelled to fire at them.

You should inform the Government to which you are that H.M’s. Government regret that owing to mis- -understanding,ja£ position regarding arrival of airmen and aircraft was not fully explained to them earlier. The airmen could not in any case have arrived at Darin before the middle of December as it was essential that they should thoroughly familiarise themselves with the new type of aircraft under the guidance of tne Royal Air Force before taking sole charge of the new type of machines at Darin. As regards the subsequent delay the Air Ministry had assumed that Ifcn Baud would not require* the aircraft before they could be effectively utilised and tnat the efficiency of the new Air Force woilld be better assured by giving his pilots additional training in Iraq than by send- -• ing them to await stores in idleness in Darin. It was hoped that the question of the precise date of arrival of thepilots and aircraft would be taken up by Ibn Baud's Agent at Darin direct with the British Politic- -al authorities in the Persian Gulf in accordance with the arrangements suggested in paragraph 2 of my telegram Bo. 115 after Ibn Baud's Agent had imudum* ensured that petrol and oil, without n ich the aircraft would be useless, were available at Darin.

(&gt; SD From •s\V Captain C. 0 . Prior, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 28 dated the 28th llarch and to enclose in original together witk one spare copy.letter addressed hy Mr. I. Morris, Commanding the Hedjaz Air Force, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2. The letter explains itself and I have only to say that I received a visit from Messrs. Hamilton and Lowe, pilots, and Mr. Cribble, a mechanic, in the above force, the same morning. They had many complaints to make regarding their conditions, and asked me to help them. They said that although Bin Saud had personally assured them that they had only to mention their requirements to have them satisfied, they got no reply to their letters, and that nothing was done. They also said that the question of a water supply was most urgent as at present they were obliged to drink from a sulphur spring in which the local inhabitants washed them- -selves, their clothes and their donkeys. They added that the present aerodrome was not safe, and that a pilot taking off with a full load of bombs would almost certainly smash his plane. 3. Since the Chief pilot’s letter was received in a confidential cover I treated it as such. I told them that I had no locus standi in the matter, ana that xf the Chief gilot felt the need of materiel urgently, I would, subject to your approval, wire his requirements to the British AgentBritish Agent at Jeddah for transmission to the relevant Department of the Hedjaz Government. I also said that I woull as^ the t tneir contra.cts mignt be sent them as early as possible. I received one from Air Head uarters Iraq a short wnile ago y ano. you will perhaps be good enough to make some enquiries regarding the others. The xp&amp;frcTri question of an artesian well has, I believe, been taken up, but it is doubt ful if such a well will be successful at Darin as similar b/orings at Qatif had failed. 4. I then sent for Hassan Qusaibi, the only member of the firm present in Bahraiu^He had intended to hold up the letter to the Bnir, ( as you will see the letter was sent in implicate, with a copy^to Qusaibis and the Foreign Office ) and to try an arrange a f sulh f between the parties. It appeared to me best that early orders should be passed on the Chief Pilot T s letter, since a reconciliation appeared out of the question, and I advised him to wire the main points of the letter to the Dmir. I had formed the opinion some time ago that Lir. Hamilton was an undesirable character and I am sure that his retention will lead to trouble. 5. It was sufficiently unpleasant discussing such amatter with Qusaibi, but I have little hope tnat a clear and early decision will be given, ana furtner un pleasantness may be expected, particularly when Mr. Hamilton learns as he eventually must, of the uhief Pilot f b pro posals . The ghief Pilot, who is a hard and keen worker, is faced with a superhuman task. He has little hold over me Officers, and seldom receives replies to the letters he writes to his chief?, who, moreover,probably do not understand what is required of thim. They are expected to train up an Air Force on an aerodrome they consider unsafe, and have the prospect of spending the hot weather in huts with a sulphurous water supply* 6. I have no doubt that the less this Agency intervenes in their affairs the better, and their contracts, I believe, preclude their approaching their Chief! except through/ through the proper channels* In the ciresistances, I should he glad if you would inform me what action I should take, should the Chief Pilot request me to forward a request to his chief through the British Minister at Jeddah, and to what extent I may assist the members of this Force.

As Year Higlmess is no doubt S'.ware the customs of / the British permit us to drink alcohol in moderation, but being in His Majesty’s service, this practice has only been indulged in privately, and, even then, in very small quan- -titios. Last night, the 25th March 1930 ( English reckoni-g) I ordered three aeroplanes to carry out I lying practice on the following day, and detailed one pilot, Mr. L.S.hamilton, to convey the order to the mechanics, who live in a separate building. He departed to carry out my instruct! e. v joined by Mr. Lowe, while Mr. Korth and I retiree, to bed. I was xk awakened several times during the night by noise ana was amazed ana ann.yea to find next morning that Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Lowe hat spent the wnole night in the mechanics’ mess, drinking to excess with their subordinates and talking in a mutinous manner. I cancelled my order regarding flying, as neither Mr. Hamilton nor Mr. Lowe were in a fit state to carry out their duties, and investigated the case as soon as they were sober enough to be questioned. As Mr Hamilton had several grievances against the Hejaz Government and Mr. Lowe wanted to consult a medical Officer. I sent them both to Bahrain, with orders to report to Messrs ^usaibi ana to the BritishBritish Political Agent, Captain Pritr.

From To Captain C. G-. Prior, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Culf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 942 dated 7th June 1930 and to forward the following report. 2. Mr. North called upon me yesterday and gave me a copy of the letter to the Amir Faisal of which I enclose a copy. I have asked him not to forward it until I receive telegraphic instructions, from you, so that if you consider any alteration advisable it will be possible to have it made. 3. You will see that the pilot Lowe who has just returned from Bahrain to Darin, having been in hospital here with malignant malaria, has taken up Mr. Hamilton’s work of creating trouble among the mechanics. He is an un pleasant young man with no manners, and from what I have seen of him I have no doubt that all that has been written aDout him is true. 4. Since writing the enclosed letter the Chief Pilot Morris has been ill&gt; snd Mr. North tells me that he had decided that it would be best to part with the mechanics gribble and Cairns as well, since they refuse to carry out any orders given them and openly defied the odief Mechanic Mr. Cleal, ( who Corroborated thi?,)but owing to his being unwellunwellhe was not able to amend the letter so as to inclde thenw 5. The whole trouble arose in the first place by one Chief Pilot having no disciplinary powers over the force under his command. Even with carefully selected and rexiaD^e men this would place him in a very difficult position, but witJs. persons like Hamilton and Lowe trouble was bound to occur. It occurred to myself, Mr Belgrave and Captain Parke, on seeing Mr. Hamilton for the first time that he was an undesirable character, and I hear from the Officers of the Royal Air Force that he was unsatisfactory whilst in that Service* It is astounding that he should ever have been selected and I would be glad to hear that it had been brought home to the person responsible how aue- much avoidable trouble and embarrassment he has caused to all of us. 6 . I saw something of Mr. Lowe during his stay here. He is a shifty young fellow who drinks more than is good for him, and he never ceased abusing the Hedjaz Government and the Ousaibis while at Bahtain. I could not discover that he had any valid grievance. It is true that they are housed in huts, but in summer all the Shaikhs in Bahrain move into them, and they are considered much cooler than houses. It is true that tne water supply is slightly brackish, but it almost invariably is on this coast and it is no worse than that drunk dai±y b^ ail members of the American Mission here. The grievance that pay was in arrears has been disposed of, ana unless he is determined to undergo no hardship whatever, I cannot see what serious grievance he can have, and at the beginning of such an enterprisesome difficulties must be expected. Since Mr. Lowe personally told me that he intended to resignresign at the conclusion, of his first year, I think resigna- A tion should be anticipated and that he should be discharged without more ado» If he remains on in the Force, I understan 7 A that Mr# North, who is of a much better typw, will resign a and Chief PilotMorris will be left isolated. V* As regards the mechanics Cairns and Cribble, I think that some communication from the Chief Pilot to his superiors is required before any move can be made, and thougl both men are of a troublesome type, I think that if Mr. Lowe is promptly dealt with it may not be necessary to discharge them at once. They instead leaving the Force at the end of the year in any case • 80 The Chief Pilo$ also sent me a message to the effect that he thought it would have a very good effect if I were to go to Darin and speak to the malcontents. I am not at all sure that it would, and apart from annoying the Hedjaz Covernment to whom the .usaibis would promptly report my mission, I do not see what I could achieve there . Unless I am authorised hy you to give them a warning of some kind I should have no locus standi, and as they would certainly bring forward a series of counter complaints against the Hedjaz Government and the Chief Pilot, which I could do noth ing to set right, no useful purpose would be served. I request that I may be given telegraphic orders on this point. 9 . I venture to submit the opinion that the bes tii-g that can to doaa is to disband ths Foroa as early as possible. The Bedjat Gorermeat .ere encouraged to have British planes and pilots so as to exclude foreigners .ho .ight be inimical to our interests, but nothing could be more damaging to onr prestige than these disputes bet.een the personnel of this Force. I fear that .ith the type of person supplied and the conditions they teve to live under such disputes are likely “““ 4l '”‘ S ' TheThe machines are purely military planes, and are of little value for for the civilian aviation that is now apparently to he required of this Force, and if they were flown hack to Shaiha and their spares returned, the way would he clear for the Hedjaz Government to obtain more suitable machines, and ourselves to he free of a menace that may at any mpment create a very serious incident. The fact that the hedjaz Government are not replac ing Mr. Hamilton may he an indication that they are contem plating reconstituting the Force with a cheaper staff. 10. Unless early action is taken to stiffen up the discipline of the Hedjaz Air Force, a regrettable incident may occur at any minute. The following incident which has been reported to me by Mr. North,whose veracity I have no reason to doubt,will show what I mean. Early on the morning on which Mr. Hamilton concluded the drinking bout which led to his discharge, a party including Mr. Lowe, and the mechanics Cairn and Gribble held ^pantomime parade, aue lowering the Hedjaz flag which had already been foisted, they proceeded to rehoist it with mock ceremonial. 11. To sum up. I recommend that Mr. Lowe f s discharge should be expedited as far as possible, and also,should the Chief Pilot apply for it, that Messrs. Cairn and Gribble should be similarly dealt with. That the Chief Pilot should be armed with ade quate power for preserving discipline. 12. I request that I may be infonaed whether I should go to Darin and if so what attitude I shoulu adopt there, and finally I request that I may be informed by tele gram as to whether Mr. North should deliver this letter to - iusaibis to be forwarded to the Amir Faisal. Mr. North will remain at Bahrain till some reply is received regarding Mr. owe. ^ j have the honour to be, Gir £ r ’ Your most Obedient servantHejaz Air Force, Daria, 5th June 1930. Reference No. H.A.F/5l/l5/0. To His Rojal Highness the Emir Faisal, Mecca. Your Rojal Highnesss, I have the honour to bring the following facts to jour notice and respectfully request that you will take the action that I have recommended. / If jou will refer to mj letter No. HAF/25/3/0 dated the 26th March 1930, jou will fifid details of a disgrace, ful occurrence in which two pilots, Mr. L.S. Hamilton and Mr. C.L. Lowe, were implicated. As a result of this letter, Mr. Hamilton was dismissedfrom the Hejaz Air Force, but Mr. Lowe, who was equally involved, was permitted to return to Darin, as it was considered that his inexperience of the East, and my unwillingness to ruin his career for what I thought at the time to be more Mr. Hamilton’s fault than his, was a suffici ent reason for not taking more drastic steps; moreover, I imagined that Mr. Hamiltons’s dismissal would act as a power ful warning to him and a deterrent, but I was disagreeably surprised to finf that his attitude was one of direct in subordination and that he obviously considered that he hsd been treated in an unfair manner. It has been my intention, since I accepted the post of Chief Pilot to the Hejaz Air Force, to combine strict (oyal ty to the Hejaz Government with the endeavour to maintain British prestige in the Hejaz and Nejd. This should not be difficult with the right type of Englishmen to support my efforts, but I regret that it has become an impossibility under the present conditions. Unless one is prepared to accept certain hardships as a matter of course, and, above all, to treat the Arab in a manner that is likely to promote goodan good feeling between the two races, it is better that such individual is removed from a service where he can do no good, but is likely to cause an incalculable amount of harm. Such t a man, I regret to say is Mr. Lowe, who, apart from making no effort to learn or respect Arab customs, persists in regarding the Arabs as an inferior race unworthy of his consideration. Such an attitude is impossible and can only lead to grave trouble sooner oir later; he forgets entirely that he is employed by the Hejaz Government and that his first duty is to his employ ers. Moreover, he is actively engaged in fostering discontent among the mechanics, who during his recent absence, have been quietly and happily, but, since his return, have become dis satisfied and unruly. He has constantly disregarded my orders, is completely unreliable and untrustworthy and I do not consi der he posseses that degree of efficiency required to mark him as likely to ever become a successful pilot in this service He does not appear to be temperamentally suited to life in the East and I doubt if he is physically fitted for the work that this Force may be called upon to carry out. His behaviour to Arab gentleman who have shown us kindness and assistance nas been rude and boorish and his attitude to me and Mr. North has been that of open hostility. As Mr. North has signified his intention of placing his resignation in my hands if strong action is not immediately taken, I beg to request that Mr. Lowe be at once suspended from duty and removed from Darin. I con sider that his behaviour merits his dismissal from this service and trust Your Royal Highness will again support me in order that the efficiency of this Force may be maintained. As we are doing but little flying at present, I xl. a t n carry on until 8 . substituto consider that Mr. North and I can carry Trip-land; the marking of the Katit- for Mr. Lowe is sent from Engia , wf 4 . eI r A -lo nf which scheme have been submitted Jiddah Air Route, details of whicn a -n em lov us for some time, after which we can con- to you, will employ ub ™ r rv centrate of re-f.mng this f*&gt;r« “ out the work it may be called upon to per o Highnes , I U conclusion I wish to assure Your Royal Highness r . - i • „ that I entertain towards the Hejaz Govern of thdloyal feelings thatm mentind w g „ui M desi „ to tUs ^ ^ the it deserves to be - and end that I consider can only be attain I j ed when it is ridded of the influence that are working against *j j tne 'aoveiijnent and hampering me at every step tMf j take.

M 1 ' Sir, Jedda/, May 31. 1930. WITH reference to the last paragraph of my telegram No. 60 of the 22 nd May, I have the honour to state that I had some general conversation regarding air- matters with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, when I saw him for the first time for the discussion of general business, on the 28th May. My object was to provide a sort of general setting for any representations I may have to make from time to time and to do something towards minimising the suspicion to which a series of isolated requests or suggestions might give rise in the mind of Ibn Sand. 2. At our previous meetings, Sheikh Fuad Hamza and I had deluged each other with protestations of our desire for mutual confidence. Taking this as my starting point, I said that I had detected a certain note of mistrust in the rider to his reply to my communication regarding the case of Pilot Hamiltoiiv (see the last paragraph of my telegram No. 62 of the 21 st May). The question of the use of wireless had nothing to do with that case and I did not quite see why it had been dragged into what was the first communication made to me by the Hejaz Government on a matter with which I was dealing personally. . 3 . Fuad Hamza explained volubly that the question of wireless did not come into the Hamilton case and that he had merely taken the opportunity of saving something which arose out of earlier exchanges of views. Later in the conversation I admitted that I had taken that part of the message from , Ibn /g' n^nted to text and had made the most of my text m order to enforce what I really wante say myself. , £ n f L The general run of my remarks ^was as follows .— p; Hie: Maiestv’s Government, I said, had helped the King to create an air force Sy had provided him with aircraft on favourable terms. They had secured for him personnel, which at any Hamilton, seemed to be satisfactory. gf rir , • 1 politics it did not end there, with the matter ended there. As a ma pr l , n f a sc heme with which because we were interested &gt;n th « suc ®f a f u L„ r et a to s^me interest in British we had had so much t K^Wemcf^ had promoted What I wanted subjects whose entry into the Ki . _ ■ . ^ t ;f f rom time to time the King and Fuad Hamza of them would be made in a His Majesty’s Government made sl W s ‘!° n iet to he ip.

I had come, I said, from Morocco. A letter could be brought by air from Toulouse to Casablanca in fourteen hours. How? By flying across Spain. And anyone in Europe would laugh, if it were suggested that that constituted any violation of Spanish sovereignty. The same thing applied to such a matter as landing grounds. I had noticed that, when this subject had been broached on one or two occasions, Ibn Sand nad demurred. He had had good reasons for this at a time when it might be more unsafe to descend among rebel tribes than to stick to the air, but he had now happily pacified the area involved. 8. 1 was careful to explain to Sheikh Fuad Hamza that I was speaking generally in that spirit of frankness which we had agreed should be the basis of our relations. I intended, I said, to speak on the same lines more summarily to the King and I should be glad if he would amplify anything I might say. I had adverted to many possible questions, about which I had no instructions to speak, but which might arise separately as time went on. I should have to speak to the King, however, about one matter and I hoped it would be considered in the light of my general remarks on the Hejaz Air Force. The Wapiti aeroplanes, which had been provided, had been sent out, because the King was eager to have them quickly, without certain additions needed to make them as perfect as our own. I was to suggest that the King should send his aeroplanes to Hinaidi to be equipped with the improvements in question by experts who understood them. 9. I think that my observations to Fuad Hamza may serve a useful purpose. I am confident that, carefully worded as they were, they can at least do no harm, provided I myself confirm them in general terms to the King, thereby reducing any danger of their being unduly distorted. Fuad Hamza received them with every appearance of sympathetic acquiescence. At the same time, I still feel that caution should be used in advancing specific proposals of such a nature as to alarm Ibn Saud and that we should go very slowly at least until I have built up, if I can, a stronger personal position with him. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Bagdad and to the Political Resident at Bushire, in the former case, with a short covering despatch explaining how I came to engage in the conversation.

On the otherhand the position may have been altered recent deterioration of situation indicated in Bushire telegram of May 9th No. T. 83. Air Ministry consider therefore that Morris*s views should be ascertained confidentially before any action is taken with Hejasi Government in connection with possible transfer. An excellent opportunity for doing this would be afforded if, as is hoped, Hejazi Government accept proposal that aircraft should proceed forthwith to Mined.di to be fitted with mechanical improvement ( see my despatch of April 30th No. 126) It is desirable therefore to secure early acceptance of this proposal. If, however, Hejazi Government are unwilling to consider proposal, or delay their reply unduly, other method of consulting Chief Pilot may he necessaryneloauros in Jbralgn Offio. covering letter dated 29th ,j!a y 1930.

The latter matter might, if more convenient, he dealt with at Baghdad. Will you also be so good as to arrange that in due course the Treasury is approached on the question of charge.

Dear Lloyd, | . u ' With reference to our official letter Ho *E. 2431/2/91 of May 17th ell closing the copy of our telegrarr No, 74 to Jedda about the Hejazi air force, and more especially about Hamilton’s repatriation, I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Trickett of the Treaaury on the question of cost. As regards the maximum amount of two hundred pounds, you will j remember that it was agreed at our meeting at the Air Ministry that, i even if Hamilton were repatriated first-class and his successor were i given an outfit allowance, the total amount would be unlikely to : exceed more than about one hundred and fifty pounds. It was agreed, ! however, that there was no reason why Hamilton should not be sent home by the cheapest possible route, and that there was no need for him to travel otherwise than second-class, Moreover, as you will have seen f from Jedda telegram No,62 of May 21st, of which a copy was sent to 1 you in our official letter No*35.2625/2/91 of May 23rd, it now seems ' doubtful whether it will be necessary to send out a successor at all. In these circumstances I think the Treasuiy limit of two hundred pounds should give us an ample margin. As regards the question of obtaining from Hamilton a formal undertaking to repay the cost of his repatriation, I do not think the Foreign Office are concerned, since Hamilton will be in the hands ox officials under your control, either in Bahrein or Baghdad, nor would it be our business to refer to the Treasury on the natter of the incidence of the expenditure which will not, in any case, fall on our Votes. In the circumstances I think I can only pass Trickett’s letter on to you and ask you to have the necessary instructions sent to the Political Resident or the High Commissioner, in whatever way you may think moat appropriate, and to a.e that the neoeaanxy reference. to the Treasury ia made in£ue course.

Following is paraphrase referrea in my immediately preceding telegram. Your Majesty will appreciate great goodwill shown by His Majesty‘s fiovernment in this as in other BoxfcfcE matters affecting Air Force. They are confident that question of flights over Easa on which I consulted you on June 12th will be studied with equal goodv/ill. Experimental pearling flights this year if possible organised would confer great benefits on important industry and provide experience most useful in future development of taat region. All that yam would be necessary would he that you should sanction certain number of flights by Royal Air Porce aeroplanes at regular intervals and arrange marking out one or two emergency landing grounds. These need not be equipped with stores. They would merely be known places where aeroplanes could land if necessary. Air Force might mark them out before leaving unless you should prefer to enlist British assistance. I explained to Your Majesty on June 12th desire for collaboration between friendly Powers which H is Majesty's Government in considering suca projefts. You promised to consider matter in simi ar spirit though naturally wishing to study all its aspects. X trust you will he able to inform me of your conclusions^ in near future. Ryan.

Tr view of your opinion that if made now formal request might Prejudice chances of larger scheme for regular air seivite to India, Kis Majesty’s Government are willing to defer the present application. However, the matter is becoming increasingly urgent i or following reasons:- ( J -)* Agreement with Persian government regarding the use ol the South Persian air route will expire dn April There is some douot whether satisfactory renewal'^'' will be secured, and possibility of utilising Arabian air route may then become matter of urgent importance. It is important therefore that Ail Ministry should nave adequate prior exrerience of Arabian route. We have also hitherto assumed that such preliminary flights as those now proposed would be the most effective*metnod of ensuring a favourable atmos'here in 1932. (2) A telegram has just been received from High / Commissioner for Iraq reporting that German Junkers Company, who already operating between Teheran and Eaghdad, wish to form subsidiary company to convey pilgrims by air next season between Kerbela amd Mecca. Attitude towards this proposal to be aoopted by His Majesty's Government ana Iraqi Government is unlikely . to be favourable, but Junkers will posaioly arproach Hejazi Government through German Government direct with a request for permission to inaugurate service in Arabia , irrespective of attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government and Iraqi Government as regarde Iraq. If lift. Sddd •g^aqteq^rerrniesipn it wcula.mean that firstlirct air service in Arabia would be instituted by fereign rather than British aircraft, with consequent injury to British prestige, wnile if he refused he would probably quote such refusal as p/ecedent for not complying with future British requests. it is uesireble there!ere that His Majesty’s Government should, if possible, take action with Hejazi Government cel ore Junkers make any move. (3) Botn Junkers and Imperial Airways have been approached oy American oil interests with a view to possiole aerial geological survey over country between Koweit and Bahrein externing for IOC or 2CC miles iniana. It may be 0 ifficult if approached by Imperial Airways , for His Majesty’s Government, to refuse to ask Hejazi Government for permission, since no acuot Junkers will do so through German Government. It seems possible that although these flights v/ould be unaertaken by civil aircraft, a request for permission for this type of inland flight may be even more inoppoitune than one for airect coastal flignt ay Service aircraft, and may, if maae first have even worse reaction on main scheme. ( 4 ) . Althougn the force of your argument regarding Ibn Baud’s suspicions that His Majesty’s Government are endeavouring to interfere in affairs of Kejazi air force is appreciated, Air Ministry consider that in twelve months’ time condition of that force may have deteriorated owing to lack of facilities for renewals and repairs. If there should ce serious aeterioration in efficiency of air force it is possible that atmosphere for obtaining our desideiata may be even more unfavourable than it is at present. ( 5 ). Ibn Baud will presumably shortly leave for Nejd and will net return to Hejaz till next yed . This may involve either a aangerou^lj -onglong postponment of the matter, or difficult negotiation ty correspondence, v;hich might afford a /T? greater scope for misunderstanding than a personal conversation at the present tiire. ( 6 ) • A valid and convenient reason for suggesting special service is afforded by pearling season. Once it is over, pei'mission could prooably be sought on general grounds only which, might be harder to justify. In these circumstances might it not be possible and desirable to sound Hejazi Government or the King informally, with a view to obtaining more definite indications of their probable reactions without putting forward any definite proposal ? It appears that general question has not been broached directly with them since 1927. It Is recognised on the other hand that it might be better to abandon altogether the idea of pearling flights in connection with Indian air route. Once made this request would have to be pressed, and it is arguable that it is better not to dissipate our energies in advance. You are at liberty to use your discretion in taking ary action that seems desirable to you before Ibii baud’s departure.

In late 1929 the British Government authorised the sale of four Wapati planes, 1000 twenty-pound bombs and other equipment to Ibn Saud's Hejaz Government, who required them for the purposes of establishing an airbase at Darin, near Al-Qaṭīf on the Gulf coast.Correspondence in the first part of the volume is concerned with the logistics of transporting planes, equipment, armaments, fuel and British staff (pilots and ground crew) to Darin, much of which was carried out in secret. The second part of the volume relates to the problems encountered in the day-to-day running of the airbase. These include problems of insubordination and drunkenness amongst the British staff, malaria, lack of adequate drinking water, and an insufficient understanding on the part of British staff of local Arab customs. Within six months of its operations, Ibn Sa‘ūd decreed that the Hejaz Air Force's base should be moved to Jeddah.Items in the volume include:A printed copy of correspondence from Mr Bond, His Majesty's Agent and Consul at Jeddah, to the Acting Hejaz Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 25 August 1929 (folio 55). The letter gives details of the sale and cost of aeroplanes and related equipment to Ibn Saud's government;Official (folios 82-83) and demi-official (folios 84-86) reports from the Bahrain Political Agent (Captain Charles Geoffrey Prior) to the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Biscoe), dated 25 November 1929, describing his visit to inspect the new airbase;Prior's letter to Biscoe (folios 130-32), dating 29 March 1930, describing the problems emerging amongst the British staff at the airbase;A copy of an employment contract for the chief mechanic of the Hejaz Air Force, dated 25 October 1929 (folios 151-54);A copy of a telegraph sent by the Foreign Office, dated 31 May 1930, which describes the strategic importance of Britain establishing an Arabian air route (folios 209-11)</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Charles Geoffrey Prior</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
