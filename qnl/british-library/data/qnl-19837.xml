Dear Sir, In order to save delay in the event of the Government of India desiring to comrmmicate with yon on the subject, I enclose, in duplicate, copy of a letter fron the Foreign Office, dated the 12th March 1912, and. of its enclosures regarding the proposed Bahrein Order in Council. For convenience of reference the passages are marginally marked, in red ink, in which the wording oj the draft Order now sent differs from, that forming Enclosure No. 6 in the letter of the Government of India to the Secretary of State, Foreign Department (Secret), No. 67, 8th June 1911. C 0 Py of the present letter is being communicated' to the Foreign Department. Yours faithfully. * le Political Resident Persian Gulf, ■ ;copy. &amp; FOFEIG-N OFFICE TO INDIA OFFICE. 12th March 1912. Sir, With reference to the third paragraph of the letter from this Office of 23rd Pecemher last, relative to the proposed Bahrein Order in Council, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward- Grey to transmit to you herewith copies of the draft as amended, in this Department, together with notes explaining the reasons why the various amendments made have been thought advisable. These amendments have already formed the subject of unofficial discussion with the Legal Adviser to the Secretary of State for Ind i u. I am, c&amp;c., (Signed.) Louis Mallet. I i —&amp; CONFIDENTIAL. DRAFT BAHREIN ORDER IN COUNCIL. ?&lt; &amp; ih v fay 4 VV A-* &lt;■1^ -M /'J Pcir ■ _ tJS) Notes on Amendments suggested by the Foreign Office. THE majority of the amendments are merely verbal, and have been introduced either to sim plify the language or to adapt the phraseology to that employed in other Orders in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 189 ). Some of the definitions ia Article 4 (for merly 3) have been omitted as unnecessary, the ^ words being already defined in the I nterpre ta tio n Ac t. Article 8 (formerly 6) has been rearranged; sub-Article (2), which was copied from the Zanzibar Order in Council. 1900, is un necessarily elaborate for Bahrein, where jurisdic tion over foreigners is claimed by His Majesty's Government under the grant from the Sheikh, and not under arrangement with the foreign Governments concerned. Sub-Article 5 has been divided so as to relegate ships to a separate sub-Article (6), and this sub- Article has been made to apply to British subjects and foreigners only. It is scarcely reasonable to deprive the Sheikh of jurisdiction over his own subjects, except to the extent that they are within the bond fide domestic service of persons subject to the Order, and this scarcely applies to their ships. Article 10 is new, but similar provisions are to be found in the Ottoman and China Orders. Article 11 (formerly 8) was taken from the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1897, which was altered in 1903. The language in sub-Article (2) ' are hereby made applicable ' was found to be ambiguous, as it was not clear whether the enactments referred to applied automatically or required some further official act to bring them into operation. P urther or future Indian enactments were made applicable to Zanzibar by King's Kegula- tions instead of by Order of the Secretary of State. [168 A] 1/n As the system introduced in Zanzibar in 190St was found to be more convenient than that of the earlier Order, similar changes have been made in the Bahrein Order. A slight alteration in Article 12 (1) has been made, and the powers of the Magistrate under the Acts scheduled to the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, conferred on the District Court, i.e. r the Political Agent, so as to avoid the delay consequent on a reference to the Political Eesident. In Article 12 (4) (d), the area of the groups under Part II of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, has been extended so as to prevent incon venience^. Article 14 (2), formerly 11, is new, and is based, on a provision in the Morocco Order in Council, 1889, viz., Article 11 (1). It would be exceedingly inconvenient if the Political Resident had to visit Bahrein before he could exercise any functions conferred upon him by the Order in Council, and as the Morocco provision has stood unquestioned for over twenty years and is certainly con venient, it is desirable to adopt it in Bahrein. Articles 17 and 18 (formerly 13 and 14). The lansruasje has been amended, so as to make it O C7 , quite clear that Article 17 only applies to Bahrein, and that the machinery of section 7 of the Foreisrn Jurisdiction Act must be made use pi. of if a sentence of imprisonment is to be carried out elsewhere. Articles 21 and 22 (formerly 18 and 19) have been made to apply only to British subjects. / Orders of prohibition or deportation against Bahreinis would not be reasonable^ and until ; , British jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein has become firmly established, the deportation of foreigners would be almost certain to cause friction with foreign Powers. Furthermore, the grant of jurisdiction ovef foreigners from the Sheikh seems scarcely to ; , '' t- - cover such a proceeding as deportation. Article 32. A similar Article is now inserted in all Orders prepared in the Foreign Office. Article 35 (formerly 31). The draft of this Article departed from the usual type {e.g., Article 28 of the Persia Coast and Islands Order), but the reason for the change was not explained^ The elasticity, which was apparently all that was desired, will now be given by sub-Article 5 of Article 11, and accordingly the Article has beenbrought into line with that in force on the Persian side of the Gulf. Sub-Article 2. See note on Article 14 (2). Article 3*8. The Foreign Jurisdiction Admi ralty Order in Council has been applied instead of applying certain sections of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890. (See India Office letter of the 24th July, 1911.) Articles 39, 41, 42 5 43. The duties prescribed by these Articles have been conferred on the District Court, as the Political Resident can scarcely be expected to attend to matters of this kind. Article 40 has been amended, so as to bring it into line with the more modern form. The old Article 40 has been struck out as being unnecessary; the matter is covered by section 2 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code, 1908, which applies in Bahrein. Articles 51-67 have been substituted for the' Articles formerly numbered 47-50, as the modern type of provision on the subject of registration of persons. The register of companies was intro duced in the Ottoman dominions by the Order in Council of 1910. Articles 75 and 76 are new. The former is taken from a similar provision which was in force in the East African Protectorates, where there w r ere no Consular officers, and the latter was suggested by the India Office letter of the 24th July, 1911. Article 78, formerly 59, has been slightly amended, because of the amendments in Article 11 (formerly 8). The Article numbered 64 in the draft has been struck out as unnecessary, there having been no previous Order in Council in Bahrein which is being replaced by this Order.&amp; r /Vott:- '^e tnayrgmaX in red ,hh 'maiv'calc pa,isasjes uyhwe kfc ^cCinc, cUfftsS from th*. cUclJ* Order evahtecL tVll 'T ^ ^ ^ CONFIDENTIAL. fJ) DRAFT BAHREIN ORDER IN COUNCIL, 1912.

S'V Dear Sir Percy, I have Juat received a copy of the isemi-final drait of the order in Council,and take thia opportunity of sending you a note regarding juat one point in it. • I «ould cftll your attention to para.8 (2),the definition of Poreignera whom the Order appliea to. The definition aeema to leave it entirely to the Shekh to determine what Poreignera are to oe auoject to our juriadiction. . Both oefore and aince writing hia letter ot 't-y. o(f asking the Britiah Govt.to aaaume juriadiction over Poreignera he haa very explicitly atated that among them are not included the aaDjecta ot Arao Chiefs with whom he haa private 'treatiea'• Theae he claima the right to treat aa hia own aubjects. Thia assertion haa never oeen accepted ,but neither haa it been categ- -orically denied. The queation waa last dealt with in your letter No•254- dated 29 — 1 — 11 to Knox. I have just had another caae which I h^ve tided over without entering into the matter. It seems to me absolutely neceaaary if we are to avoid much trouble in the future that the Order in Council decide the queati^ one way or anothsr for the future,either 1. oy asserting our entire juriadiction over all persons not of Bahrain birth, 2.or oy, admitting the Shekhs contention out tflking steps to define precisely its application. Under the second alternative we should examine the alleged agree ments D3tween Shekh laa and the other Chiefs,find if thetf are ack -nowledged by the^reapective partie3,and then if suitable iormally recognising them. At the same time we would lay down Liii-i a*iy dispute arising out of them between two chief a ahould be obligatarally referred to ua for final arbitration. With the preaent toxt of th3 Order in Council I ajn perfectly aure that we shall have much trouble. We should normally have to take up the cases or any Arab foreigners,but at any stage in ftiiy cajQ Shekh Is? would be able to step in and claim the men as xi., proteges,and all wo could do would be to take hia word for it as the decisive point in the O.in C. is the Shekh's 'agreement' or 'consent'. # I have not had any time to think the thing out,but I am not at all aure that we would lose anything by adopting the 2nd alternative. In haste. Yours sincerely, V. • n I seud thla by Wlison.who will be aola to toll you or s fsw minutes or oonvera»,tion we have hf d on the subject. ^ (rX- l J\^. v &lt;-« J } crc® .

Ho explanation of the oaiGsion is offe ^ed in the Note on the amendwents fcy His Majesty^ Porei^&gt;n Office, but I presume it has been held unneces ary to make special provision for the powers therein provided. 3 As regards the other amendments, I have nothing to urge against the acceptance of the majority of them, for as tated in the r^ald Hotes, they merely tend to simplify the laRcutro or adapt it to that employed in other Orders in council, but there are certain important exceptions to this category which affect the spirit and working of the Order fuadaweritally am in regard to these I bee to aj o:?fer the following observations .sanction of the Governor General in Council or of H.M. •g Secretary of state. Instanc os of the kind however would be of extreme rarity. on the Other haad It auet be remembered that 'Foreigners' will inolido sut.jectn of Turkey, Persia, and other aon-Christiant Po: err, dependents of &lt;o«tty Muhamraad n Rulers of the Coast and t Hln tori-nd of Arabia, and natives of qatar abd other seml-lndepe endont tracts not enjoying Brltl h protection outside Bahrain.

I have received the following from the S of State dated Julyai7th« begind;- Case for taking powers for deportation is rather weakened by your telegram of the 6th July seeing that the class of foreigners against whom it is most likely to be used will, if Sir P.Z.Cox^ definition be adopted, be exempt. In view of the fact that he thinks that deportations of Europeaan foreigners will be extremely rare(vide his letter of May 15th) is it w^rth while to take sueh powers at all? If? so it must be done by the Ordar in 0 ouncil, in which case another letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain will be necessary in order to make it clear that the juBisdiction which he has ceded to us includes the powoB to depott. Sir P.Z.Oox^ telegram also seems largely to destroy the case in favour of foreigners being registered©' Please let me have your viwws on both points by telegraph ends Kindly let me have your views by telegraph ForeignTele gFam P From Resident To Foreign Simla no • 754 dated July 23rd 1912 In reply to your telegram no 427S of the SOtV July, I have the honolJr to invite a reference to para 6 of my letter no 3134 of ^ i the 27th November 1910® Even should some of the special agreements which the Shaikh claims to possess are fotthcoming, and prove satisfactory on examination, the case of Asiatics falling under denomination 2 and a proportiraj ^ under 3 and 4 has still he to taken into a ocount. In particular denonination 2 form/a large and troubleso-e cormunity(vide para of my letter of the 15th May) and in my view the case --or deportation or registration is not seriously weaken**/ in either instance. As regards deportation, however, I consider that to make a further request to Shaikh Isa for a Specific delegation of poweBs to this end would not he expedient, and should it be finally J # decided that this step is a sine qua non, then we must in my opinion forego for the present the power to deport foreigners ourselves, and when necessary have recourse to action through the Shaikh of Bahrain. With regard to registration, I am unaware whether, as in the [ case of deportation, there are intricate points of international law involved, but from the practical point of view the registration of icreigners is sttll regarded by me as very desirable, owing to the increasing numbers of denomination 2: a great increase has tek*n place , especially in the Persian community.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. Proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. * Letter to Foreign Office, dated liitk-Anguat 1912 (without enclosures). Letter from ditto, dated 29th August 1912 (with enclosure). Letter from ditto, dated 26th October 1912 (with enclosure). t Comma here omitted. M y L oud, With reference to correspondence ending with Your Excellency's telegram of the 30th July last regarding the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein, I enclose for your information copy of later correspondence'^ with the Foreign Office on the subject. 2. It will be seen that, in the absence of any specific delegation from the Sheikh of the necessary powers, no provision has been made in the draft Order, as now revised, for the deportation of I foreigners, but provision is being made, in deference ' to your recommendation, for the registration of other persons besides British subjects, although as pointed out by the Foreign Officfe such an extension of the system of registration is in some degree anomalous and not altogether consonant with the practice elsewhere prevailing. 3. As regards the construction and wording ofi f Article 8, sub-article (2), to which attention waa^ drawn in paragraph 3 of your letter of the 20th June last, the comma to which allusion was made b}^ the Political Resident in his letter of the 15th May last Ims now for greater clearness been omitted, the passage running: ' Foreigners! with respect.to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed,' t^c. This provision, which appears in nearly all Orders m Council under the Foreign Jurisdic tion Act, secures the exclusion of the Arabs referred to in your telegram of the 6th July last, since they are foreigners in Bahrein whom the Sheikh has not placed under British jurisdiction. Ko amendment, as suggested in that telegram, of the definition of ' foreigner ' in the draft Order, is in the circumstances required. But if Your Excellency apprehends that the wording of Article 8, sub-article (2), may lead to friction with the Sheikh, and to claims by him that particular persons or classes of persons have not been put under our j j jurisdiction, it has been suggested to me that the / point might be met by the insertion, as a new sub-article at the end of Article 8, of the following words, which are more or less on the same lines as Section 4 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, and are s. 184.aualagons to provisions that are found in other Orders in Council, viz., ' If any question arises ' whether the subjects or citizens of any country, ' state, or tril)e have or have not been placed ' under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agree- ' ment with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the ' Political Resident, and a certificate under his ' hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question, ' and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.' 4. With regard to Article 21, sub-article (1), it will be observed that it has now been made to read : ' Where .... any British subject .... is intriguing within the limits of this Order against His Majesty's power and ' authority,' &amp;c., instead of: ' Where .... ' any British subject .... is intriguing against His Majesty's power and authority within ' the limits of this Order,' &amp;c. 5. I observe that notice is drawn, in paragraph 2 of the Resident's letter of the 15th May last, to the omission, in later drafts, of Article 16 of the draft of the Government of India. Tlie Article in question was a textual reproduction mutatis mutandis of Article 15 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. But whereas the latter Article was in place as a provision for the enforce ment of warrants that had been issued in inland Persia, the Article as drafted in the Bahrein Order was inapplicable, since no reason exists why authorities in Bahrein should back their own warrants. 6. I shall be glad to be informed by telegraph whether Your Excellency's Government agree to the issue of the draft Order in the form now trans mitted, which differs from that previously sent only in Article 8, sub-article (2) ; Article 21, sub-article (1) ; Articles 51-59, and the table in Article 3 ; or whether you would desire the insertion in it of the new sub-article referred to in paragraph 3. In order to avoid delay, copy of this despatch is being communicated direct to the Political Resident. I have the honour to be.

OAi . . . It will be seen that the Govern- Teleerram from ditto, dated oUtn July j. x t i* j • 4. h ment of India desire that provision should be made for the deportation and registration of foreigners. As regards the former, it seems clear that it cannot be effected by executive order; and while it is no doubt desirable on general grounds to provide for it in the Order in Council, the Marquess of Crewe is inclined to agree with Sir P. Cox that it is inexpedient to ask the Sheikh for a specilic delegation of powers for that purpose. His Lordship is not aware of the reasons for which your department pieferred to limit the registration of non-Bahreinese to British subjects, and, unless there is strong objection on international grounds, he would suggest that it should be compulsory on all persons to whom the Order will apply. I am, &amp;c.. The Under Secretary of State, 1^. R itchie. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. No. 35,018. Foreign Office, gi r5 29th August 1912. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant relative to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. Sir E. Grey notes that the Marquess of Crewe does not support the recommendation of the Government of India that provision should be made in the Order for the deportation o f foreigners , and this point will accordingly not be deafiTwitTi in THe'present letter! As regards the extension to foreigners of the registration provisions of the Order, which is also desired by the Government of India and advocated by Lord Crewe, I am to state that the reasons which led Sir E. Grey to suggest the limitation of these provuaQns in the case of non- Bahreineae to British subjects wereTfirst/fhat registration is irksome, and it seemed better not to subject foreigners who are not British to an unnecessarily vexatious regime until British jurisdiction had become firmly established ; and, second, that it is desirable that Foreign Jurisdiction Orders in Council should be kept uniform as far as is reasonably possible, and that the registration provisions of the usual s. 184. a 2type become almost meaningless wlieu they are extended to foreigners of every nationality. The register of British subjects is not merely a list of the individuals who are subject to the British Court in the particular foreign juris diction. Registration and the possession of a certificate of registration is evidence of British nationality, and the possession of such a certificate counts like a passport and entitles the holder to British diplomatic protection. It appears therefore to Sir E. Grey to be inconsistent with the character of the whole system of registration that a certificate issued at Bahrein should be quite different in its effects to a certificate at Basra. The Zanzibar Order in Council contains no registration provisions at all, and Zanzibar is the close parallel of Bahrein, because in both places all foreigners are subject to the British Court. Registration at Zanzibar is a voluntary matter, and the register which is maintained at the Consulate (or Agency) is limited to British subjects. The French Consul no doubt keeps a similar register of his nationals. In consideration however of Lord Crewe's concurrence in the opinion expressed by the Government of India and of the arguments advanced by Sir P. Cox in 1910, Sir E. (Irey is prepared to waive his objections to the extension to foreigners, other than British subjects, of the registration provisions, and I am to transmit to you herewith a revised draft of the articles dealing with this question which, with His Lordship's approval, it is proposed to insert in the Order in the place of the existing Articles 51-67. It will be observed that it is intended that the revised articles should apply only to individuals, and that the provisions for a register for British companies have been eliminated as these cannot yet be required in Bahrein and it would be difficult to enforce v compliance with them by foreign companies. I am to observe in conclusion that if these revised articles are inserted in the Order it will become necessary to re-number the existing Articles 68-87 as 60-79 respectively and to introduce a corresponding alteration into the table in Article 3. I am, &amp;c.. The Under Secretary of State Louis M allet. for India. Annex. 51. A register of persons to whom this Order applies shall be kept in the Political Agency. 52. Every person to whom this Order applies being of the nge of 21 years or upwards, or being married, or a widower, or a widow, though under that age, shall register himself at the Political Agency within three months of the commencement of this Order, if resident within the limits of this Order at that time, or, if arriving within the limits of this Order within one month after such arrival. Provided that a person who fails to register himself within the time limited by this article may be registered at any time if he excuses his failure to the satisfaction of the Political Agent. 53. The registration of a man shall comprise the registration of his wife, or wives, if living with him ; and the registration of the head of a family shall comprise the registration of all females and minors, being his relatives in whatever degree, living tinder the same roof with him at the time of his registration. 54. Registration tinder this Order shall be renewed annually in the month of January.55. Every person who has not previously been registered applying to be registered under this Order shall, unless excused by the Political Agent, atteud personally for that purpose at the Political Agency, but no person applying for the renewal of his registration need attend personally unless directed by the Political Agent so to do. 56. Every person registering himself under this Order may obtain, if he so desire, a certificate of registration in such form as may be presented by the Political Resident. 57. If any person to whom this Order applies neglects to register himself under its provisions he shall not be entitled to the protection, assistance, or good offices of the Political Agent, and shall be liable to a tine not exceeding Rs. 25 for each instance of such failure, but he shall, although not registered, be subject to tiie jurisdiction of the Courts established by this Order. 58. A person applying to be registered under this Order must produce such evidence as the Political Agent may think necessary that he is entitled to be registered. 59. Registration under this Order shall be no evidence of nationality, and a statement to that effect shall be inserted on the face of every certificate of registration issued under this Order. 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit to you the accompanying copies of the revised draft of the Bahrein Order in Council. 1 am to enquire whether the revised draft meets with the concurrence ui the Marquis of Crewe.

F0E1GNTelegram. To Foreign Delhi, No- 33 Dated 19th March 1915, — y \W The Srd paragraph of the Foreign Office letter suggests that article 29 of the Muscat Order has become an iJhachronisi owing to the issue of Acts of Parliament of 1873 and 1879. It seems to be doubtful therefore whether the powers asked for can now be given except by Act of Parliament. Subject to that doubt, I agree that a single order giving Resident Slave Trade jurisdiction within the limits of the Muscat, Bahrein and Persian Coast and Islands Orders would be convenient^in principle. To that end the case of Bahrein could first be regulated by a separate order ad hoc. The case of Muscat however ts differsnt as under the present order the Resident has no appellate jurisdiction tf/of over it. This however is provided for in draft submitted for a new Order, ^id if the issue of the latter is approved in principle, concur in the view that it would be better to suspend action until it issues. Meanwhile subject again to the decision of the question raised in para 1 above there would seem to be no objection to regulating the case of Bahrein. The case which prompted the original suggestion was that referred to at conclusion of your telegram under reply. Cox,Telegram. P. From Foreign. To Resident. No. 0-217. Dated and reed. 29-3-13.

Sieve Trade Jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf. it. a I The deslr? of the India Office as expressed In their letter of June 10th 1913 is that in the 'ersian Gulf the Political Resident, snd in Bahrein the Poli tical Agent, should he given jurisdiction to deal with and try slave trade cases. T am not clear that such jurisdiction can 'be conferred upon an extraterritorial court. Under the Slave Trade Act 1873, section 5, a Vice Admiralty Court in Ker 'a-iestv's nominions has slave trade jurisdiction. Similar jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court at 'uscat as the joint result of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of the seme .''Mr end th* Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act 1P79 and the Muscat Order in Council 1867 Article 29, the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act 1873 confers upon ' ar. East African Court ' the slave trade jurisdiction of a Vice Admiralty Court in Hr-r 'alesty's possessions abroa d .and th^ Act of 1879 brings the •'iise;u Court within the definition of East AfricanAfrican Court if jurisdiction in relation to the slave trade is conferred unon it ty Order in Council passed' « before or after the passing of that Act. At that dat^ therefore it would appear that Juris diction in slave trade cases could not have heen valid ly conferred upon a consular court in the Persian Gulf outside Muscat. Under Section 2 (1) of the Colonial Couits of Admiralty Act 1890 certain courts became colonial courts of Admiralty and have und o r section 2 (2) and (?) the same jurisdiction as the High Court of Admiralty in England, and as a Vice Admiralty Court under any Imperial Act or Colonial law, except that in latters relating to th' Slave trade th^ir jurisdiction Is that of a Vice Admiralty Court and not of the High Court. If the language of subsection (3) of section 2 is looked at carefully ('... any enactment referring to a Vice Admiralty Court... contained in an Act of the Imperial Parliament.... shall apply to a Colonial Court of Admiralty and he read as if Colonial Court of Admiral ty were substituted for 'Vice Admiralty Court...,') the effect would appear to he only to confer on Colonial Courts of Admiralty in Her ^a.-lestv's possessions juris diction under the Clave Trade Act of 1873, because after suchsuch substitution of words Is made as directed above, th&lt;i words In the Slave Trade Act of 1873, section 5 'In Her Majesty's Dominions out of the United Kingdom ' would continue to appear. If this Is the correct construction section 12 of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty 1890 does not seem to help. That section provides that an Order In Council may direct that the Act subject to the conditions,ex ceptions and qualifications. If any contained In the Order, shall arjply to any extraterritorial court as If the Court were a Colonial court of Admiralty. The application of'the Act' to the consular courts -r In the Persian Gulf would not get rid of the limitation existing under the legislation of 1873 that to be quali fied to exercise slave trade jurisdiction a court must either be In His 'Isjesty's dominions or be an East African Court. Some confirmation of this view Is afforded by the language of section 13 of the Colonial Courts of Admiral ty Act, which deals with rules for procedure In slave trade matters re 'In colonial courts of Admiralty and Vice Admiralty Courts in the exercise of their jurlsdic- tion in matters relating to the slave trade, and in and from East African Courts as defined 'by the Slave radeTrade (East African Courts) Acts 1873 and 1879'. This language looks as If the East African Courts nust still trace their slave trade Jurisdiction to the special Acts relating to It, &amp;nd not to their Admiralty Jurisdiction as Colonial Courts of Admiralty. TT nless the construction of these various Acts in- dicatsd above Is correct, the effect of article 29 of the Persia- Coasts and Islands Order 1907, and corres- nondlng provisions In other Orders would seem to he that slave trade jurisdiction was enjoyed hy the courts under that Order until the Foreign Jurisdiction Admiral ty Order In Council 1910, Article 4 (4) b. took It away again: and It certainly was not the Intention of the Order of 1910 to diminish or curtail the existing juris- diction of any of the Courts referred to. 5 &amp;C ^ ^No. ^7 &gt; G .

Sir. ^ I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st July No.26740/13, enclosing copy of a Memorandum regarding the legal difficulty In giving Slave Trade Jurisdiction to the Persian Coast Court and the Bahrein Court. In reply I am to say that the Marquess of Crewe agrees that In order to exercise such jurisdiction a Court must either be In His MJesty's dominions or be an East African Court within the meaning of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of 1873. The Slave Trade (East African Courts)Act of 1879 expresn- ly constitutes the Maskat Court on East African Court, and as the Maskat Order In Council gives that Court Slave Trade Jurisdiction, no difficulty exists so far as the Maskat Court is concerned. With reference, however, to the view taken in the Memorandum that in 1879 such Jurisdiction could hot have been validly conferred upon a Consular Court in the Persian Gulf outside Maskat, and to the doubt express -ed whether it can be conferred upon On extrajterritorial Court, His Lordship is advised that the Act of 1873 appears expressly to contemplate the conferring of Jurisdiction where there is an existing East African Slave Trade Treaty with a foreign State on the shores of the Persian Gulf or in any island lying off Arabia, or where there may be a futurejtreaty to tilt that effect. He admits that in the absence of any East African Slave Trade Treaty, in respect of Bahrein or the Persian Coast and Islands, the provisions of Section 7 of the Act do not apply and the power under that section to confer Jurisdiction on the renpective Courts cannot be exercis ed; and he thereforephinks it desirable that this Impediment should be removed, if possible, by the/&gt; conclusion of new Slave Trade Treaties. As regards Bahrein. I am to observe that the Treaty of 10th 1856 with the Sheikh's predecessor Is still In force. If Sir E. Grey concurs In the proposal, His Lordship will address the Government of India with a view to the negotiation of a new treaty with the Sheikh. I am to enquire whether, as regards the Court of the Political Resident. Persian Gulf, sir e . Grey considers that the negotiation of a similar treaty with Persia Is practicable.

The Marquess of ( re we desires to commend this proposal to the favourable consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Ailairs. As regards the position of the Political Agent, Maskat, which was discussed in your letter No. 1424 of the 3rd February last, Sir E.

The question of Maskat can, however, be taken up separately when the promised communication has been received ; and meanwhile there seems no reason why, if Sir E.

With reference to your letter of the 10th ultimo on the subject of Slave Trade jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a Memorandum which has been prepared in this Department indicating what appears to him to be the legal dilliculty in giving that jurisdiction to the Persian Coast Court and the Bahrein Court. I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive the observations of the Marquess of Crewe on this paper. I am, &amp;c., The Under-Secretary of State Louis M allet. for India. Annex. Slave Trade Jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf. The desire of the India Office, as expressed in their letter of 10th June 1913. is that in the Persian Gulf the Political Resident, and in Bahrein the Political Agent, should be given jurisdiction to deal with and try slave trade cases. I am not clear that such jurisdiction can be conferred upon an extra territorial Court. • 8.226. B v'/*- &gt;Under the Slave Trade Act 1873, Section 5, a Vice-Admiralty Court in Her- Mdjesty s Dovniuions has slave trade jurisdiction. Similar jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court at Muscat as the joint result of the Slave Trade (l^ast African Courts) Act of the same year and the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1879, and the Muscat Order in Council 1867, Article 29. The Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1873, confers upon ' an East African Court ' the slave trade jurisdiction of a Vice-Admiralty Court m Her Majesty s possesszoTis abroad, and the Act (&gt;1 IS/.) him^s the Muscat Court within the definition of East African Court if jurisdiction in relation to the slave trade is conferred upon it by Order in Council passed before or after the passing of that Act. At that date therefore, it would appear that jurisdiction in slave trade cases could not have been validly conferred upon a Consular Court in the Persian Gulf outside Muscat. Under Section 2 (I), of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, certain courts became Colonial Courts of Admiralty, and have under Section 2 (2) and (3), the same jurisdiction as the High Court of Admiralty in England, and as a Vice-Admiralty Court under any Imperial Act or ( olouial law, except that in matters relating to the slave trade their jurisdiction is that of a Vice-Admiralty Court, and not of the High Court. If the language of Sub-section (3) of Section 2 is looked at carefully (' k . . . ' any enactment referring to a Vice-Admiralty Court . . . contained in an ' Act of the Imperial Parliament . . . shall apply to a i olonial ^ on it ol ' Admiralty, and be read as if Colonial Court oi Admiralty were substitutod u for ' Vice-Admiralty Court . . . '') the effect would appear to be only to confer on Colonial Courts of Admiralty in Her Majesty's possessions, juris diction under the Slave Lrade Act oi li v 'i3, because ailei such substilution ol words is made as directed above, the words in the Slave Irade Act ol liS/*), Section 5, ' in Her Majesty's Dominions out of the United Kingdom' would continue to appear. i • wi t If this is the correct construction. Section \2 of the ( olonial Courts ol Admiralty, 1890, does not seem to help. That section provides that an Order in Council may direct that the Act, subject to the conditions, exceptions, and qualifications, if any, contained in the Order, shall apply to any extra-territoiial court as if the court were a Colonial Court of Admiralty. The application of 'the Act' to the consular courts in the Persian Gulf would not get rid of the limitation existing under the legislation of 187.) that to be qualified to exercise slave trade jurisdiction a court must either be in His Majesty's dominions or be an East African ( ourt. _ Some confirmation of this view is atlorded by the language of Section 13 of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, which deals with rules for procedure in slave trade matters re ' in Colonial Courts of Admiralty and \ ice-Admiralty ' Courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction in matters relating to the slave ' trade, and in and from East African Courts as defined by the Slave Trade ' (East'African Courts) Act, 1873 and 1879.' r i lis language looks as if the East African Courts must still trace their slave trade jurisdiction to the special Acts relating to it, and not to their Admiralty jurisdiction as Colonial Courts of Admiralty. Unless the construction of these various Acts indicated above is correct, the effect of Article 29 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order, 1907, and corresponding provisions in other Orders would seem to be that slave trade jurisdiction was enjoyed by the courts under that Order until the l^oreign Jurisdiction Admiralty Order in Council 1910, Article 4 (4)6, took it away again; and it certainly was not the intention ol the Order ol I'M) to diminish or curtail the existing jurisdiction of any of the Courts referred to. ENCLOSURE No. 3 -.—India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, g- r 6th August 1913. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt ol your letter of the 21st July, No. 26,740, enclosing copy of a memorandum regarding the legal difficulty in giving Slave Trade jurisdiction to the Persian Coast Court andthe Htihiein (onit. Fn reply I am to say that the Marquess of Crewe agrees that in order to exercise such jurisdiction a court must either be in His Majesty's dominions or be in East African Court within the meaning of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of 1873. The Slave Trade (East African) Act of 1879 expressly constitutes the Maskat Court an East African Court, and as the Maskat Order in Council gives that Court Slave Trade jurisdiction, no difficulty exists so far as tlie Maskat Court is concerned. With reference however to the view taken in the Memorandum that in 1879 such jurisdiction could not have been validly conferred upon a consular court in the I ersian Gulf outside Maskat, and to the doubt expressed whether it can he conferred upon an extra-territorial court, his Lordship is advised that the Act of 1873 appears expressly to contemplate the conferring of jurisdiction where there is an existing East African Slave Trade Treaty vvitli a foreign State on the shores ol the Persian Gulf or in any island lying oft Arabia, or where there may be a future treaty to that effect, lie admits that in the absence of an Kast African Slave Trade Treaty, in respect of Bahrein or the Persian Coast and Islands, the provisions ol Section 7 of the Act do not apply, and the power under that section to confer jurisdiction on the respective Courts cannot be exercised ; and he therefore thinks it desirable that this impediment should be removed, if possible, by the conclusion of new Slave Trade Treaties. As regards Balm in, 1 am to observe that the Treaty 0 of JOth May 1856 * Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. XII., p 158 ^ villi tlie Sheikh's predecessor is still in lorce. If Sir E. Grey concurs in the proposal, his Lordship will address the (io\ ernment ol India with a view to the negotiation of a new treaty with the Sheikh. 1 am to inquire whether, as regards the Court of tlie Political Hesident, Persian Gulf, Sir E. Grey considers that the negotiation of a similar treaty with Persia is practicable. 1 have, &amp;c.. The Under Secretary of State, T. W. H oldekness. Foreign Office.

Foreign Office, ^ r » 24th October 1913. i am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt ol your letter P. of the (ith of August regarding the legal difficulty in giving slave -trifle jurisdiction to the Persian Coast Court and the Bahrein Court. As regards Persia Sir E. Grey concurs in the view of the Marquess of • Crewe that Mis Majesty's Government can act under the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of 1873 if a slave trade treaty with Persia exists subsequent to that date. The Anglo-Persian Treaty of 2nd March 1882 is of the above- mentioned character, and was, by the Order in Council of 8th August 1882, ordered to be deemed to be an existing slave trade treaty within the meaning of the Slave Trade Act, 1873. It appears, however, that no Order in Council has been enacted with reference to this treaty, under Section 7 of the Slave Irade (East Aliican ( ouits) Act, 18/o, and in thes6 circumstances it appears to Sir E. Grey that the most convenient course will be to pass an Order in i Council under Section 7 of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1873,1 (a) directing that the treaty shall be deemed to beau existing East African/ slave trade treaty within the meaning of that Act; (h) authorizing the Court of the Political Resident at Bushire to exercise jurisdiction in matters relating to the slave trade ; and (c) directing that the Court shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the East African Courts by the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of 1873. ; Sir E. Grey is advised that all these points can provided for in the same Order in Council. T am, therefore, to propose, subject to the concurrence of Lord Crewe, that action should be taken in the above sense.As regards Bahrein, Sir E. Grey agrees with the view of his Lordship that a new treaty with the Sheikh of Bahrein will be required before a similar Order in Council can be enacted. Sir E. Grey understands, however, that snch a treaty could probably be concluded without serious difficulty, and in view of the fact that the want of slave trade jurisdiction is felt principally at Bahrein, Sir E. Grey concurs in his Lordship's suggestion to address the Government of India with a view to the negotiation of a new treaty with the Sheikh of Bahrein. 1 am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State E yre A.

The Bahrain Order in Council 1915 io the authoritative document defining the various capacitie® in which you and your successors will act. Art 14(1) of the Order lays down that the Political Agent at Bahrain shall be deemed to ha District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and Art 35(1) that he onall be deemed to bp District Judge. Art 66 says he may exercise certain nowem nf a Justice of the Peace, and Art 68 tnat he shall be entitl ed to act as a Notary Public. From the wording oi these Articles it would rather seen that the Political Agent is not made a District Magistrate, a District Judge, a Justice of the Peace or a Notary Public, but is Civen powers of such functionaries in consequence of being Political Agent. I should say therefore that it is as ?ol _ical Agent that he will do his work in all Departments an that it would be enough for hira to have a stamp 'Politica Agent Bahrain* for authenticating papers and a seal 'Politi cal Agency, Bahrair] ,, for closing parcels etc. If any practi- -1 ii'iculty were ever to occur, e.g. about refognition of a paper authenticated by the Political Agent under his nota- ri l ^oTTers, it would only have to be pointed out to an objec A .P .Trevor, O.I.E., tor ahrain.objector that under Arttole 68 of the Order, the Political Agent had such nowers# ill you let me have your opinion on this view of the caeet It seeme to me to be the simDleat and I do not at present foresee any practical difficulty from adopting it.1&gt; F rom To No. of 1914 Ma.jor A.

S,n. , , , In reponse to Mr.Lorimer 1 8 letter No. 268 dated the ?8th January 1914, I have the honour to submit a draft Slave Trade treaty for your consideration. 1 !ie ^rai t in ^xiestion has been based on the Treaty with uscat 187? and the Convention with Qersia 188S. I have prepared the draft with some diffidence,as my knowledge on the various diplomatic and legal (jiestions involved in Slave Trade Treaties and the juristiction based thereon is very small. A formal Treaty is,! believe,a document signed by t ^e properly accredited representatives of the Powers concerned. If this is so,and ifa formal Treaty of this type is re quired,my draft does not satisfy the retirements of the case. I have made the draft on the lines of previous engage- ments entered into by the ShaikheLf Bahrein and Oman and other parts of the Gulf. I think it would not be advisalble to adopt any other form of document , as the Shaikh might misunderstand a Tormal Treaty signed by some one on behalf of/a? o of the Government as well as 'by himself and construe it into some enhancement of his position and admission of his inde pendent sovereign rights. If therefore an undertaking on the part of the Shaikh countersigned by the Political Resident will meet the legal retirements of the matter,! venture to suggest that it would be preferable. 5. As regards the document itself I beg to say that when asked to sign any new Treaty Shaikh Isa will / I am sure # becorae very suspiciousjand therefore when possible it is better that existing engagements should be confirmed; Shaikh lBa ,aB you are aware,loathes the idea of anything new. In the circums tances I have put the words W I confirm' in the first clause of the Treaty. Clause (2) is based on Article 1 of the Anglo-Persian Convention of 18fiS and Article 1 of the Muscat Treaty of 1875. Clause (5) is based on Article 15 of the Anglo-Persian Con vention of 1882. Clause (4) is based on second portion of Article 1 of above mentioned Convention. At the present time more slaves are imported by returning pilgrims than in any other way,and such a clause might be useful. Clause (5) is based on Article III of the Anglo Persian Convention of 1882. Clause (6) is based on the second half of the above Article and Article 7&gt; of the Muscat Treaty of 187?. 4. With regard to clauses (5) and (6) I beg to say that all manumitted slaves here are considered to be British protege's: this being the case it is unnecessary to put in any clause about the Shaikh protecting them. I am not tite certain whether it would be advisable to put in the portion of clause 5 which I have put in brackets,but I think that the present practice of manumitted slaves being under out? protection should be confirmed. The Political Agent here protects all foreigners and ex hypothesi all imported slaves are foreigner / further the slaves have been liberated through the good offices of the Agency,and a considerable number of them 'or t^oir -no r&gt;pr&gt;t,p or»i frlnfill v came from Zanzibar and various partsparts of East Africa which are now under British protection. In the circumstances freed slaves have many claims to British protection here. It is unnecessary to insert any clauses similar to Articles 2 and 4 of the Muscat Treaty as no slave market here exists, and if there are any natives of Indian States here they are treated exactly the same as any other British Indian. 5. In conclusion I beg to observe that the slave cases which have arisen v -ere since T came have been in each case importa tions by Foreigners e,g # by a Somali, by a Persian and by a Koweiti; it seems to me that a treaty with the Shaikh of Bahrein would not help my jurisdiction in such cases as these,unless the Political Agent here could be authorised to hold a*East African Court under the Persian Convention as well. Possibly however when once the Political Agent's Court is made an East African Court it can deal with all kinds of Slave Trade cases under all Treaties and Conventions: if this so,of course that settles the matter, other-^'.'ise there seems to me some difficulty. It would not be advisable to insert the words ' or foreigners under Bahrein jurisdiction'after ^Bahrein subjects' in clause (5) as we have ourselves assumed jurisdic tion over foreigners,and the inclusion of such words would at once lead the Shaikh to imagine that he still had jurisdiction over them. Possibly after the Shaikh has made a treaty / a notification could be issued enforcing its terms on Foreigners resident in Bahrein, but I have not sufficient knowledge of the legal aspects of the matter to offer a useful opinion. 6.

The position is now very unsatisfactory,but I presume it cannot be rectified until some settlement is arrived at between Bin Saud and the Turkish Government^ Sometime ago a case occurred in which Shaikh Isa suddenly con fined^ Hassawis in Moharaq, and had them flogged for being drunk. This matter was all over before I heard of it. I protested to Shaikh Isa that he should not have acted as he did as the matter of juris diction had been referred to Government, and there was some correspoa -dence on the subject,but as it seemed to me that Government did not wish the matter raised in an acute form just now I did not press it. Recently a man was murdered and his head cut off near Budaya, and it was thought at first / he was a local man and the Amir was making enquiries. Subsequently it turned out that the man was a Hassawi and 2 Hassawis and a slave were arrested on suspicion. I eventually got the ! r fajor S. G. K N 0 X, 0. I. E. Offg.

One day when Shaikh Abdulla was calling just after the two e Hassawis who are in my lock up were brought in^he asked for them to be kept separate. I might if necessary get out of the difficulty on this occasion by informing Shaikh Isa that the 3rd man ought I consider,to be in the Agency lock up,but as it is necessary to keep the prisoners separate and I have not much cell accommodation I have no objection to his remaining wherejhe is. it This would be looked on as a sign of weakening (as in fact^is) but in the present circumstances it is difficult to know what to do, as In llm arniii rimmi I in mi m 1 am not in a position to insist that the man is a foreigner and so ought to be handed over to me. On the other hand the Shaikh thinks he has an undoubted right to jurisdiction over Hassawis and Nejdis in view of Bin Saud's letter and Governments' silence. He has of course long been claim ing that subjects of local Shaikhs in relations with him should be under his jurisdiction - since your day I think.Bahrain Order in Council. / 9 V t- K ^ V P.R. ITie P.A*o powers to deport are limited to Britis/ •ubjects. Pleaoe see P.R^s M.48 of 15th May 1912 para 5. -uhe secretary of State evidently misumderstood Sir Percy 1 s above-quoted letter and his telegram M. 192 # as he ( S • of S) telegraphed to Govt of India t hat the class of f Orel'Tiers against whom the power to deport r/as most likely to be used would be exempt if Sir Percy's suggestion that the words f, or the subject oi an Arab principality having a reciprocal 'agreement with the Shaikh of Bahrain' were inserted in the Order. is a matter of f^act the n foreirpiers H who would have been exempt were practically only the people of Qatr w ereao the people we want to be able to denort are chiefly Persian and Turkish subjects. The Foreign Office is apparently very nervous a.jout friction with Foreign Powers # and the India Office considers that the Shaikh^ letter ceding jurisdiction Is hardly sufficient to warrant our as- sumlng the power of deporting foreigners, and that a second letter from the Shaikh would be necessary be fore making provision for the exercise of this power. bir Percy considered it inexpedient to approach the bhaikh for a specific delagation of the powers^to deport. All this was two years ago, meanwhile the numbers of Jews and Muhammadann from Baghdad and of Persian Curds have increased, and the P.A. has fre quently been asked by the Shaikh and the % o 1 anama to deport prostitutes and procurers and boys and their exploiters - all of whom are Turkish or L* If I |I •I 7 v or Persian sub 'ecljs# Son© undoairablee, mostly, I believe, suspected house breakers have been deported or rather put on a ship an 1 told to disappear. When the order comes into force this should stop. I think the Shaikh would be Justified in saying that our right to Jurisdiction over foreigners carries with it the duty of protecting Bahrain from unde sirables. For the P.A. to reply that he hadnH the right to deport foreigners and must ask the Shaikh whom we Jealously prohibit from exercising any Jurisdiction over foreigners to do it for him would be a confession of weakness the Shaikh could not understand. ^he Shai':h's letter to i^ackenzie^ on which our Jurisdiction over foreigners is based^s strong enough to give us that Jurisdiction surely there is no reason to ercopt ne form of punishment, and that one a cheap / humane punishment thoroughly under stood and consistently practised in the Gulf. The chance of friction with Christian Powers would be avoided by Govt issuing instructions to P.R. not to sanction the deportation of subject's of such powers without a reference to the S. of S. through the Governor General. The legal authorities at home seem to dread de portation, but it might be explained to them that the deportation required is something differ nt to tfc the form to which they are accustomed, and that it 'Ight be limited to foreigners not possessing immo veable property in the islands. Do you not think that, in view of the fact that our Jurisdiction over foreigners has in the last two years become more firmly established while the ne cessity for deportations has become stronger, the subject If e I I B if I if In x-- IK subject might be taken up again. There io another neak point in the Order in Council. The Code of Criminal Procedure is applied to Bahrair but for its provisions for taking security para 21 to 2^are substituted. As regards foreigners- the P.A. can only take security on conviction - as in para 106 of the C.C.P. but no penalty is laid down as in para 125 of the ' C.C.P. Security on separate proceedings such as in ♦ provided for in para 107 of the C.C.P. cannot be tfeken from Foreigners. These two omissions are probably inadvertentf but Sfe^v/ater the P.A's powers most inconveniently. If para 20 of this Glider were omitted foreigners would, as in all other^ respects be subject to the provisions of the C .C .P. T.Keyes. 3-6-14,c-; 3;' ?:Bl : ie| ■ ♦ P.A. Bahrain• *■ — ' 1 ■■ ■ I hare read your note of 3rd June regarding difficulties you foresee in carrying out the proyisions of new Bahrain Order in Council. The latest dictum of Sir E- Grey is that you have only jurisdiction over foreign subjects and he seems to throw some doubt on your right to proteet them (vide Markomannia case)• In the circumstances, is it such a sign of weakness not to ask Shaikh to expel them for you but to permit him to 7 expel them. It would probably save you some trouble. He would have to ask you to do so. You might, I think, explain that the provisions of the Order in regard to deportation are exceedingly complicated and that it might be difficult to establish a case but that you are anxious to meet his wishes and^if the Shaikh will ask for their expulsion, you will call the undesirables in question up, ask them to show cause why they should not be handed over to thp ohaikh* You will probably find, in practice, that they have not registered themselves or something of that sort or that they are thoroughly bad characters and decline to intervene on their behalf and hand them over to the Shaikh^ officials who will undertake that they shall be expelled from Bahrain• I think the matter could be arranged, whereas the present deportation sections are so cumbersome that it will only be in very important cases, thoroughly discussed before hand, that it will be possible to make use of them. There may be a difficulty of expense but I do not think you need worry much about that. You will probably not be troubled so much by the w unco'guid' if they find that they have to put their hand in their pockets^ and ^^ they should. If they wonH pay, decline to deport^ The alternative of getting the Order ih Council changed presents formidable difficulties and I don't care to face tnem. Your•r Your other difficulty seems to me to depend on the judicial interpretation of ''Subject to the provisions of this order* 1 Part III section 14(l). Does that mean n If the Order lays down one course of action, I am bound to adhere to it n t, or ,, provided there is nothing in the provisions of this Order absolutely inconsistent with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code as regards fa taking of security I am at liberty to • * &lt;c. apply /fther procedure as seems good to me 1 * • I find it difficult to explain my point but I can imagine a process of reasoning somewhat as follows The Order in Council lays down a course of action for me in Section 20, where a person Is convioted of an offence. It is silent on what I am to do when confronted with cir cumstances contemplated by sections 107 and 125 C.C.P. But it ftas applied the C.C.P. in toto and expects me to make use of it, unless there is something repugnant to such of its provisions as I propose to apply in the provi sions of the Order. I find nothing,therefore I apply C.C.P. sections 107 or 123 as the case may be. The difference between my view and yours is this ^I regard 0.0.P. and Order in Council as concurrent, until they can be shown to conflict, when Order in Council car ries the day'. Where order is silent, as for instance of u. section 21 (l) where it is shown by evidence on oath, to 'the sHtisfaction of the District Court that any person etc^ the Order in Council gives me no guidance: I therefore turn to the C.C.P. section 107 (l) and find that it does guide me and therefore apply it. This is all special pleading but you are not likely to be worried by pleaders and, if it is convenient, I should adopt this procedure, until some one stops you. You on the other hand, contend that for the provisions of the C.C.P. for taking security paras 20-23 of Order in CouncilimmJk Council are substituted* I can quite understands^ ooxmsel for the prisoner taking that view but it is an inconvenient doctrine. On what do you base it? f have agaih read over those provisions 20 to 23 and honestly think that they are supplementary and additional to C.C*P. not substitutions. 8th June 1914. ii'b'i't1/ • ✓r 0, 6 i 2.7 British Residenoy, Bushire, 24th September 191 Uzaa. .8 Your demi-offioial letter of the 10th September 1914 regarding the oonolusion of a Slave Trade Treaty with the Shaikh of Bahrain. The matter was, I fear, delayed in this office owing to my not receiving any reply to a demi-official letter written to Sir Percy Cox on the subject. As it is possible that this demi-official letter may have gone astray, I en close a copy of it. I 't^ke the opportunity of enclosing as well the draft of a Treaty together with its forwarding letter from Trevor who was then Political Agent in Bahrain. It was this draft and the difficulties that Trevor foresaw - and I share his opinion in this matter - of inducing the Shaikh to sign any document at all that called forth my demi-official letter. I myself doubt whether this draft undertaking, for we can hardly call it a Treaty, will be sufficient for the S cretary of State but, at the same time, we shall have conriderable difficulty in getting the Shaikh to sign it and probably still more difficulty if we have anything more formal and therefore new. There is only one point where I do not find myself in complete accord with Trevor and that is where he says in paragraph 2 of his letter M I think it would not be advisable to adopt any other form of document, as the Shaikh might misunderstand a formal Treaty signed by someone on behalf of the Government as well as by himself and construe it into some enhancement of his position and admission of his independent sovereign rights'. It Major H.B . St. John, C.I.B., Foreign and Political Department, SIMLA.It is Just some suoh misunderstandIng that might in duce Shaikh Isa to si^n the Treaty, it it was put in re- t one tin I do not think that suoh a misunderstanding would make things worse than they really are. Shaikh Isa is always lighting against the inevitable and writing preposterous letters talking about 'everybody being inde pendent in his own sphere' vide his latest oommunioation i .1 r eg arc lo &gt;..assawis and nir attempt to exeroise Juris— riotion over taem. He is always obstructive and it is dif- ^ imagine that any Treaty or misunderstanding there- anent could make him more so# When he steps beyon the lim it, we can always reduce him to reason and, until he does step beyond, we humour him like a pettish child, because it is waste of time to di-ouss absurd trifling notions that are entirely opposed to actual facts. If there Is no cnance of resting content with the Inrian Penal Code as our guide in slave trade mttters, so far as Political Agent, Bahrain, is concerned, and if it is con sidered that the draft herewith forwarded will not do but tuat, as I think, a formal treaty is essential, it will not be difficult to revise the form in which the undertaking has been cast and I /ill do so on receipt of your reply and put it up officially. As regards the actual subject matter of the Treaty, I tiiink Trevor's articles will do very well at least for a basis of discussion. I would however delete the (?) clause of Article V as this convenient practice in Bahrain is op posed to our practice elsewhere in the Persian Gulf aod is based on our special right to exercise jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrain. It will be better to let the custom * crystallise and not throw a.iy doubt on it. On the other lB&gt;nd, if the form Trevor has adopted, is generally approved, I will, on receipt of a reply to that effect, forward it iLanediately officially.Basran Feb ^rui / Z^/c^ LA^iOX ill you kindly go into tne quest'on of judicial fees leviable unCer Article of the Bahrain Order in Council, v.itn a viev, to elaborating Rules of Court for Lanrain on the lines of those uade under tne Persian Coast and Islands order in Council, if this lias not already been done.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf BASRA. S ir, POLITICAL AGENCY. Dated Bahrain, the 29th March ( gi5 I have the honour to inform/you with reference to Government of India letter No.1954 of February 22nd forward ed under your endorsement of the 16th instant, that, in my opinion, it would be inadvisable to bring the Bahrain Order in Council into effect during the continuance of the War. The Shaikh of Bahrain and his subjects are extremely touchy as to their position, and resent any innovation. Even before the outbreak of war the merchants were much exercised at my installing a petition writer, as they believed this to be the first step towards more regular judicial procedure. Since the arrest of the German merchant here and of the Germans in Bushire, they have become still more on the alert, and would certainly strongly resent any action which could be construed as an attempt to extend our powers. Were the Order in Council brought into force it would be impossible to conceal the fact that some change had taken place. For instance under Section 36 the Political Agent has to enquire from the several parties if they desire that proceedings shall be in accordance with the' the Code of Civil Procedure or in accordance with local ueage. There is also the question of substituting fees for the khidma which is now paid to the Shaikh. This point will require some negotiation# If the Order in Council wore calculated to strengthen our hands it would be worth while exciting a certain amount of distrust even in the present circumstances, but, on the con- -trary, it whittles down the Political Agent's powers, es- -pecially in the matter of repatriation of undesirables which has proved most useful during tbe last few months. 2. Secondly I consider that the Order in Council needs some modifications, BUggeot i ono ao tio which, with one exceptior I will reserve for another letter. Section 45 (l) c lays down that a suit between a Bahrain subject and a foreigner may be referred to the Majlis-ul-Urf : ^ or decision and 45 (2) that the .j udfrment of the Majlis shall be considered the same as if it were that of the district Court. This provision appears to be based on a misconception as to the functions of the Majlis which is not a Court, but an advisory body similar to a Council of Elders under the Frontier Crimes Regulation. The Majlis merely gives a finding, which if accepted, is embodied in the Political Agent's judgment, and is incapable of any more extended functions. I consider that this defect should certainly be remedied before the Order in Council is brought into effect. 3. No more copies of the Order in Council are re quired by me. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Major, Political Agent, Bahrain. ^7BAHRAIN. /cA. I hope that you will see that Qovemment does not bring the Bahrain oner In Council Into effect until things are more settled. Of course It is very desirable to regular- -Ize our procedure, but It Is not worth while sacrificing anything to this object in the present circumstances, and I am certain that any change would excite distrust when the minds of people are as unsettled as they are now. I have given one important example of what I consider a defect In the Order, Beside this, the provision for taking security from foreigners needs revising, and provis ion should be made for the repatriation of undesirables as distinct from deportation as known to English law. Further the Order gives the P.A. the same powers as a District Judge In Bombay, who has, I think, powers up to y 5000/-. This would leave a lot of simple pe»rl cases to be tried by the Resident, but, apart from the Inconven- ^ -lence to parties, I really donH see how he could try such cases without coming over to Bahrain. In Baluchl- -stan an Assistant Political Agent has unlimited Civil powers, and I think even an B.A.C. has powers up to 5000/-. The Order (vide section 79) should come into force within 6 months of Its publication, but this can probably be got over. If it Is brought Into force I shall want an increased establishment, and there will be a great deal of work to be done before August in drawing up Regulations and Rules for fees and Registration. I have got no records here bearing on these subjects, but expect you have had a good deal of correspondence In Basra, The question of abolishing the Shaikh's ten i 'khldma 1 , which Is only taken by us on his behalf on any sum paidinto Court or obtained by attachment 9 and giving him compen- -satlon out of fees will be a thorny one, and will have to be taxen up in conjunction with improved Police arrangements. Owing to the murder of a Christian merchant by burglars r I have at last got him to dismiss all the low class foreign 'naturs 1 , enlist thirty of his own men and establish three Police chowkls. He seems rather pleased with himself, as he Imagines he Is Initiating the reform; but he wants money for this. The best way for him to get It Is to extend the present 'natur* cess, which Is only paid on shops, to all houses over a certain size, I have told him that there Is no objection to his doing this as far as foreigners are concerned. Re 1/- per mensem on shops and large houses. As 8/ on small houses and As 4/ on huts should pro- -vlde enough to pay for the Police and Sanitation. It would be a great thing to get both properly organized, but he Is a shy WLd bird In the matter of reforms, and I am very anxious not to endanger these by exciting suspicion In his mind, which I am convinced would be done by the Intro- -ductlon of the Order In Council.

Grey is aware that the Muscat Order of 1867 contains such a provision, but I am to call your attention to the fact that that Order is one of an obsolete type and that no clause of the kind appears in any modern Order promulgated under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. 4. It further appears to Sir E. Grey anomalous that Sir P. Cox should be given slave trade jurisdiction in Bahrein when he does not possess it under the Persian Coasts and Islands Order, and I am accordingly to suggest that if an amending Order, such as that alluded to above is issued, it should be made to apply to that and to the Muscat Order as well as to the Bahrein Order. 5. I am to state, however, that Sir E. Grey is not satisfied that any need exists for the issue of such an Order, and that he would be glad, before considering the question more closely, to receive fuller information as to the incident which prompted Sir P. Cox's suggestion. 6. I am accordingly to propose that he should be instructed to furnish the necessary details by mail. 7. With reference to the further suggestion contained in the telegram from the Government of India of the 23r(l ultimo, copy of which was enclosed in i. 2(1*. byour letter of the same date, that the (Indian) Pilgrim Ships Act (14 of 1895) should be included in the Schedule of the Bahrein Order, I am to inform you that, in Sir E. Grey's opinion, the better course would be to apply this Act by a King's Regulation. 1 am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Louis M allet. for India. 4 ENCLOSURE No. 4 :— India Office to Foreign Office. p. 438.

With reference to your letter of the 3rd February 1913, No. 1,424, as to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein, I am directed to inform you that the Marquess of Crewe concurs in the proposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to allow the Order to come into force as it stands, and to deal if necessary, in a separate Order, with the question of slave trade jurisdiction. j ioi.i t. , toiq Copy of a telegram 0 sent to the Viceroy * Dated ISfch February 1913. o. -.i r on the subject is enclosed herewith ior your information. It will be seen that His Lordship is consulting the Govern ment of India on the points raised in the 4th, 5th, and 6th paragraphs of your letter. As regards the (Indian) Pilgrim Ships Act, I am to observe that the reasons for which Sir E. Grey considers it preferable to apply this act by King's Regulation are not stated in your letter. Lord Crewe is advised that, from the Indian point of view, its application by Order in Council would be the more regular course, and he would urge that, unless there are strong reasons to the contrary, the Act in question should be included in the schedule of the new Order, as recommended in the Viceroy's telegram of the 23rd January last/f His Lordship is advised that such modih- + Copy communicated to boreign Office, cations as may be required to adopt the 23rd anuai y . Pilgrim Ships Act to local conditions at Bahrein could be effected by a King's Regulation issued subsequently to the Order in Council, and that no delay need therefore he incurred in bringing the Order into operation.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, relative to the Bahrein Order in Council, and to transmit to you herewith printed copies of that paper 0 in the * Not n intod form in which it is proposed to put it into 0 P lin * operation. I am to point out that Article 8 (2) has been amended by the omission of the comma after the word ' foreigners v at the beginning to meet the objection raised by the Government of India in their telegram of Gth July last, and that a new sub-article (7) has been inserted at the end ot the same article containing the words suggested in the Marquess of Crewe's despatch No 41, Secret, of 15th November (paragraph 3) and accepted by the Government of India in their telegram of 28th December. The word ' prescribed ' has also been substituted for the word ' presented ' in Article 5G in deference to the wish of the Government of India expressed in the same telegram. In Article 11 (3) ' Article 70 ' has been substituted for ' Article 78,' which appeared, through an error, in the draft of the Order, and ' K.G.' has been inserted after SirE. Grey's name in its last paragraph.Ii will Iu, noted tlicit these alterations are m addition to those agreed on in earlier correspondence which have been already introduced into the draft Order. As regards the second paragraph of your letter under replv, I am to state that the reasons which led Sir E. Grey to propose that the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act should l)e applied by a Kings Regulation rather than bv inclusion in the schedule of the present Order have already been communicated privately to a member of your Department. They are that if the Act is applied by a King's Regulation any modifications necessary to adapt it to local conditions (such lis were required in the Persian Gulf and Muscat) can be made in the Regulation itsell, whereas il the Act is included in the schedule a King's Regulation would also be necessary to provide for the modifications, and that this might cause further delay in the promulgation of the Order. In view, however, of the preference expressed in your letter for the latter mode of procedure ^for which, however, no specific reason is given), and of the opinion stated in the last paragraph that no further delay is likely to result from it. Sir E. Grey is willing to waive his objection to the inclusion of the Act in the schedule, notwithstanding the fact that in all other where it has been applied this has been done, so far as Sir E. Grey is aware, by a King's Regulation It will be observed that the necessary insertion has been made in the schedule to give effect to Lord Crewe's wish. I am to state that, subject to any further observations which Lord Crewe may have to oiler on this question. Sir E. Grey would propose to submit the Order, in the form in which it is now enclosed, to the Law Officers of the Crown, and, on receipt of their approval, to forward it to the Privy Council with a view to its promulgation with the least possible delay. f am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, Louis M allet.

I suggest your replying to Government by wire that the best time to introduce the Bahrain Order in Council is August^, next the latest possible date, and that the Fblitical Agent should be empowered to introduce it gradually, as opportunity arises, abstaining as far as he legally can from active enforcement of its provisions whenever he considers that such action would cause local resentment. (2). Tell Keyes that the Order cannot be altered; it must be brought into foree and acted on for a couple of years* when we shall be in a better position to see its defects, which should be brought to notice in the Annual Report on the working of the Order in Council required by Article 77 of the Order. (3). Ask Major Trevor, Officer on special duty, Bushire, to take up all questions connected with the Order, and to dispose of them from Bushire, without reference to Nt you, as far as practicable, it being understood, (i) that the Order should be given effect to gradually as far as possible. (ii) that it should not be altered at present. (iii) that When applying the Indian Pilgrims Ships Act the same modifications should be introduced as in the case of Bushire under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council.

(v) that it should be borne in mind that our object is to have similar rules and practice in force on both sides of the Gulf, and every effort should be made to prevent differences of prac tice arising, except in so far as they are necessitated by a difference of circumstances. ^yCc , 9-a /a- st^ -I' IFrom The Hon'ble Ueut-Bolonel sir P.Z .Oox, K.c.

To The Political Agent, B a h r a i ru Sir, j ^ I have the honour to refer to your letter NO .S99 dated 29th i 'arch 1U5 on the subject of the Introduction of the ' Bahrain Order In Council, which has been handed over to n* by the Hor. the Resident for disposal with certain remarks. ' Sir Percy Cox Is of opinion that, while It Is not very convenient to bring the Order into effect d lt rlng the continuance of the war, it is impossible to delay the application of the Order indefinitely, and that most of the objections which you ave raised will offer^serious difficulty or require special treatment except the question of the Shaikh's Khidmah, provided that the Order is introduced gradually and quietly. He there fore wrtte^ to the Foreign Secretary to the CJovernmant of India to the effect on the 19th April and you have received a copy. No doubt some points such as that about the Majlis which you mention in paragraph S of your letter will require modi fication, but it will be best/thforder for a year or perhaps twp and then put up the points requiring modification in the light of experience. 1 would, however, observe, en passant, that the Majlis is not exactly the same as a Council of Elders under the Frontier Crimes Regulations because when one of his subjects is involved in the case mdnn tint the Shaikh can (and does sometimes) decline to accept the decision of the Majlis e .g. the various claims against Ahmed Yatim at one time landing contractor. His Majesty's Government has asked for a draft King's Regulation/ making whatever alterations may be necessary in the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act at Bahrain. I attach a copy of the King 's Regulations in force under the Persian Coast and Island -•Islands and the Masqat Order, and beg to enquire If you consider that the same Regulation^ can be made under the Bahrain order in Council. It is desirafcle that the Regulations under the Bahrain Order should / as far as possibleybe assimilated to those under the Persian Coast and Islands Order, as our object is to have similar rules and practice in force on both sides of the Gulf as far as possible. Th3 Foreign Department has also asked that similar action may be taken in respect of other enactments included in the Schedule of the Order. As, However, it has not been found necessary to make modifications in these enactments under the Persian Coast and Islands Order, it will not, I expect, be necessary to make any modifications at Bahrain. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Officer orv'Special Duty. (In the absence of the Resident) MajorP .A.Bahrain. Roferring to the order in Council question. f To ray raind tho position is thisi succossivs P«As have for 10 years past been exercising magisterial and judicial functions, which are not authorized by any law, and by doing so have established fairly definite sustontt and usages. The Order in Council is intended to put such usage, ol? rather as much of it as convenient, on a lep:al basis, it does not, however, (I take it) abolish all usages not embodied in it - and in fact Section 88 says that the P.R. or an officer subordinate to him can enforce 'the observance of any KagcmsaraiH reasonable custom existing in Bahrain unless this Order contains some express and specific provision incompatible with the observance thereof' This partcular section is not quite so clear on the subject a3 similar sections in some other Orders-in-Council, but it seems to me to authorize a continuance of such establish ed custom. Paragraph 75 (3) also I think shows that a p.A. can do things not mentioned in the Order. The result of the Order thus in my opinion is that, whereas hitherto every Judicial act done by the Political Agent, except orders passed on B.I•subjects as a first class Magistrate, was illegal, after the introduction of the Order quite a number will be legal. Nothing in the order should, it seems to me, prevent a P.A. from continuing to do anything reasonable which he did before, though in case of British subjects and possi bly some Persian subjects and Basravis known to be sea lawyers, it would be advisable to exercise caution in cas -f V some appeal might result in the P.A's authority being specifically entailed. Liow/turn to the points you have raised. (1). The :'-ajlis-ul-Urf is described in the definition as a Civil court x x x x selected oy the Political Agent in concert with the ;jhaikh n ,A8 you know this is not correct25 correct, as it is more an advisory body. Section 45 (2) cer- f tainly should have the words 'when ratified by the Pol itical Agen^and Shaikh, if necessary' after 'Majlis-ul- Urf' similar to article 44 (l)c in the case of Kazis Judgments and I think words to thiA effect can be under stood until some one tells us not to,by which time it may be time to propose some suggested amendments and alter ations to the Order. (2). . security for good behaviour from foreigners. I should say that the P.A. might continue to do this under established custom, especially when the local au thorities or Kazi have brought up the foreigners as bad characters. (3). similarly in regard to the repatriation of undesir- able foreigners. This is an excedingly well established custom, not only in Bahrain but in every other part of the Persian Gulf. Every Shaikh and Local Government does it, in the absence of a regular and efficient Police Service it is the only thing to do. Provided that no specific charge iB made to Government I do not think any questions will ever come up unless some sea lawyer gst gets deported in which case Sections 74 and 75(iii) coupled with 'the request of the local authorities' will probably meet the case. One would have to be a bit careful about repatriating British Indians, but it can be done, and I have done it in lots of cases here, and at Muhammareh, and no questions raised. (4). Pearl cases over 5,000/-. I think except possibly in cases between two British subjects it would be quite possible to deal with those by referring to arbitrators Majlis or Salifah etc., in short doing what you do at present. (5). Fees and Establishment etc. Government has sanctioned a post of 250-10-300 and25 house rent and also an increase of 3000 to office allow ance which you will be able to spend on salaries how you like# I ar applying to Government to sanction it from 1st July to give you a little time to fix up matters. I think the scale of fee^under the Persian Coast and Islands Order is too heavy for Bahrain? I attach a copy. Probably it would be better to introduce a scale more like the Indian scale? I think that when you Jfeave got the scale drawn up and the Ling's Regulations issued .it would not be necessary to start levying them all at once,- a beginning might be made on British subjects - (6) Shaikhs Khidmah. This will be a difficult point but now that you have got your extra Establishment and everything sanctioned, it is not so pressing. Government will not, in view of the fact that owing to the continuance of the war, the Order is being introduced gradually, any immediate receipts from fees. I should think t^e Khidmah might be paid to the Shaikh for tne present until some favourable cnportunity occurs for making an arrangement. Ii 1066 similar to those levied under the Persian Coast and Islands Order can be levied it would simplify matters as they would come to a good deal more than 10^, and the shaikh could be compensated from them without dif ficulty. Such a scale,however, is only intended for well to do merchants trading in Persia and is obviously not in tended for a large comparatively poor community as I have found at Muhammareh. Bushire{/ t Bahrain. 10?V:16. / t/'Z£^OcFL~ your letter 877 of 6tn: and enclosed »ote : - P ara 3^ You say that the Majlis Is not exactly the same as a Council Of Elders, In my letter under reference I said that It was similar In that It was an advisory body and not a Court. The reason you quote for not considering It the same la really another point of similarity, as the Magistrate can, and often does, decline to accept the flnd- -Ing of a Council of Elders, My point which you accept t In your Note, Is that the Majlis is not a Court which can give a judgment, but an advisory body which caiyglve a finding. Para a. In quoting Sir Percys opinion you go further than he did In his official letter In saying provided that the Order Is Introduced graduaily and quietly. 1 Will if you read this with the following words In your note, n The result of the Order thus In my opinion Is that, where- ASas hitherto every Judicial act done by the Political ••Agent , except orders passed on British Indian subjects ••as a First Class Magistrate, was Illegal, after the Intro- ••-ductlon of the order quite a number will be legal.' I dont thlnX that you are right here. The ShalXh has hitherto been the sole source of law in the Islands. He has delegated certain powers to the P,A 0f whose action within the powers delegated Is therefore strictly legal, though not sanctified by a British Ordnance. Once you have Introduced a British Order any action which Is contrary to the provisions of that Order, either directly, or by implication, becomes Illegal. You cannot Introduce an Order In Council gradually. The day it comes Into force the whole of It Is In force.The tHree most important matters m which the P.A.'s actions ^whlch he cannot forego If he la to maintain order and settle Civil disputes satisfactorily) will become illegal on the introduction of the Order are : - (1) Prohibiting foreigners from living in Bahrain. (3) Talcing security from foreigners without a conviction, as in Section 107, C.C.P. (3) Treating the Majlis as an advisory body and not as a Court. Of course, as you say, the P.A. can enforce any custom unless the order contains any provision incompatable with it; but, in the three above matters it does. (1) When the Order, in a portion relating to British subjects and foreigners, and in a section Immediately following one (section 31) which empowers a Court to taxe security on con- -viction from British subjects and Foreigners, empowers the P.A # to prohibit British Subjects from living in Bahrain, it is clear that foreigners are intentionally excluded from this provision. (I) As section 80 specifically gives the p.A. power to taxe security on conviction from British subjects and foreigners, it is clear that this is the only provision for taxing secur- -ity from foreigners and that the extremely useful powers of 107 C.C.P. are not applicable to them. (3) Has already been dealt with at length. To allow the Order to come into force with the tacit understanding that it is to be brought into action gradually is, in my opinion, not as you say in your note, to confer legality on some of the P.A^s illegal actions. On the contrary, it maxes illegal some of his actions which are now legal. Sir Percy's letter to Government gives no indie- cation that it was his intention that the order should be introduced gradually as stated in your 877. Did he tell t you that this was his intention ?As regards Introducing Regulations re feea gradually, I see no objection to 2* this, as, presumably the authority that aanctlons the Regulations can direct the manner of their Introduction. I haven't yet managed to get a Court Fees Act. Can you lend me onel It Is a difficult question, and there are two questions of principle involved, as the Shaikh has hitherto taxen his Khldma^nd his officials per- -form some of the actions for which we will take fees. Also the local custom only admits of Uhldma when the Court actually collects the money # Can I begin to make enquiries in the Panjab and Sind for a sarlstadar and Judicial Assistant^ Personally I do not thlnX that the Assistant is at all necessary, but It will be a useful appointment In which to train a man for some of the posts which mt&amp;ch will be made after the War, I enclose a Note I had written on the Order. Major A.P.Trevor, f.1.1.NOTE ON THE BAHRAIN ORDKR IN COUNCIL. fa* f k. Majll^-ul-Urf rifeans an advisory Council of not leas than 4 members selected by the Political Agent in concert with the Shaikh of Bahrain^^tesides the Salifah-ul-Ghaus, to which pearlers' claims are submit ted,there is another Court,the Salifah-ul-Bahri^which adjusts accounts and settles disputes between owners, masters and crews of local sailing craft. It is therefore necessary for ^alifah Court 1 to substi tute:- Salifah-ul- Gha u s means a Court consisting of one or more Judges who have knowledge of local diving law and Customs and are appointed by the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Political Agent in concert.' 3alifah-ul-Bahri means a Court consisting of one or more Judges who have a knowledge of local marine customs and are appointed by the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Political Agent in concert Section 14. Under section 268 of the C.C.P. all trials before a Court of Session are by Jury,or with the aid of Assessors; and,under section 270, they are conducted by a Public Prosecutor. As trial by jury or with assessors is not suitable to Bahrain,and there is no Public Prosecutor,a paragraph should be added to the following effect * Notwithstanding,trials before the Political Agent 'sitting as a Court of Session may be without Jury or 'Assessors,nor need the prosecution of such trials be conducted by a Public Prosecutor'. Section 20. Sections 103 and 107 of the C.C.P. are both very necessary but the wording of section 20 of the Order in Council, though giving slightly wider powers than 106 of the C.C.P,, impliesimplisa that Section 107 ia exoluded from the Order. It would,therefore,be better to omit Section 20 altogether. Section 21. The persona to whom thia order refers are:- Britiah subjects, including British protected persona,and Foreigners, i.e. all persons except British and Bahrain subjects. They may be classified in practice as (a) Subjects of Christian Powers,British and other. (b) Indians. (c) Other British subjects and proteges,such as Egyptians, Somalia,Zanzibaris etc.,and perhaps Afghans. (d) Ottoman and Persian subjects. (e) Arabs of the mainland,who are the subjects of various autonomous or semi-amtonomous Chiefs. n.B . Shaikh Isa holds that he did not hand over this class. Persons of all these classes were parties in civil or criminal proceedings during 1914. Since Shaikh Isa handed over to the British (rovernmebt jurisdiction over foreigners' matters have developed con siderably. The main directions in which development has taken place are:- 1. Increase in the number of foreigners residing and carry ing on genuine business in Bahrain. For these the Civil side of the Order is adequate,and merely needs slight alterations to ensure smooth working. 2. The use of Bahrain by Persian and Ottoman subjects generally of an undesirable character,as an asylum. There has been in recent years a large influx of pros titutes ,procurera and other bad characters from Basra and Bagdad,and also of Jews from those places who found it profitable to set up fictitious businesses in Bahrain and,after trading for a Rhort time,and sending all their assets out of the Island,to go bankrupt. There were alsoIll also 'before the war with Turkey a large number of Basris and Kurds who came here to avoid cona^iption or the perse- oution of officials. Our assumption of jurisdiction over foreigners' carries with it a moral obligation to protect Bahrain from persona of this description who have begun to make a use of it under our aegis. 69 persons were pul? on board ship and sent to their homes during 1914. The majority of these,as detailed below were sent away during the last 6 months of the year,and,in con sequence, the number of criminal cases dropped from 57 in June to 1 in December. Ottoman subjects 45 Persian n n Arab l Indian l (Agency sweeper) Somali i Several procurers and prostitutes who were suspected of acting as receivers of stolen goods also left voluntarily after an example had been made in one or two cases. In only one case was it necessary to place the persons being repatriated under a guard on board ship,and thi^Was when a large batch of bad characters from Basra v^ere being repatria ted after the Turks had commenced hostile acts on the Riv^r. be This case may therefore^put down directly to the war. In no other case was any trouble given,the only action taken by the Agency after the Order of prohibition had been made being to provide the person with a ticket• This form of repatriation or prohibition from living in Bahrain is a suitable and humane Corm of punishment,or rather precaution. It is thoroughly well understood in the Gulf and is expected of us by the Shaikh and his subjects as a protection to the law- abiding inhabitants. It is moreover in use and works smoothly and without hardship. Section 21 (l) only applies this form of prohibition to BritishBritish aubjecta, and no provision ia made for freeing Bahrain from undesirable foreigners,who include r all the olaases of which it is most desirable to be rid. Were the word 'person* substituted for 'British subject' the necessary protection would be given. It must be noted that if Basra is annexed to the British Empire a large number of persons of this class will become British subjects. Subsection (2) requires that each such order should be reported to the Governor General of India in Council. This hardly aeema neceasary for auch a mild proviaion. If it is considered necessary to differentiate between Europeans and Asiatics,this could be done by an order to the Political Agent not to proceed under this section againat the aubjebts of any European Power or againat Americana without the per- miaaion of the Governor General in Council. Section 22. It would follow that for 'Britiah aubject' in 22 (l) should be aubstituted 'person'. It would then be necessary after 'the place' in sub-section (4) to insert 'for British aubjects*. Aa regarda dealing with foreigners who might refuae to comply with an orderof prohibition,if the legal and diplomatic difficulties are too great to admit of a provision^deporta- tion or forcible repatriation,they would naturally be dealt with under Section 123 et seq. of the C.C.P. ; but,in prac tice, it would seldom be necessary to take action under tf^ese sect ions, as it has been found that persons whom it is desired to repatriate cheerfully take their departure when they have been given tickets to their homes. Further suggestions regarding Criminal Law. There are two more points in which the regular Lav; of India as laid down in the I.P.C. and C.C.P. is hardly suitable to Bahrain,and procedure somewhat similar to that holding in the N.^.F.Province and Baluchistan and as Droposed in the Panjab Criminal Panchayat Bill.be introduced into the Order. They are:- (a The option of refering criminal cases to Arbitrators 0- or to a Council Elders. * It• » It is hardly necesaary to labour the argument t. ^ - - - - - that in undeveloped communities *oonoiliation' is the only means of effecting a permanent settlement,esreoially in family quarrels and quarrels in which local customs are in question. The advisability of Conciliation' before judicial proceed ings is recognised in the Order (vide Section 10), and it is most desirable that provision should be made for similar 'conciliation* subsequent to the institution of judicial proceedings• This could be done by inserting a section after Section 14 following the lines of the Frontier Grimes Regulation. I have not got a copy of the F.C.R. here,and am therefore unable to suggest the wording,but the Council of Elders would become a special Majlis. (b). The rules for compounding offences (Section 345 of the G.O.P.) are not entirely suitable to Bahrain,for the instmnce grievious hurt is non-compoundable,and eventless of a tooth is held to be grievious hurt. A settlement effected by 'conciliation' even after a fight in which serious damage has taken place is much more likely to be lasting than a regular settlement in Court by which a fine or imprisonment is inflicted . I am under the impres sion that this unsuitability of regular law to unsophisti cated communities Is -nrovided for in the F.G.R.: in any case both theft and 'grievious hurt,to say nothing of murdrr are,in practice,compounded in the N.W.F.P.,Baluchistan and parts of Panjab. Were a provision made for the reference cf disputes to arbitrators or a Council of Elders 'conciliation' could be effected without any special pro vision regarding compounding. CIVIL. Section 35 (l) I believe that the powers of a District Judge in Bombay are upto 5000./-, but do not know if this is in accordance with rules made by the High Court. It is necessary to give the Political Agent unlimited powers as to Civil suits InIn Baluchistan even an A.P.A.can be given unliinited powera by the Local Government but I doubt whether the noroinaticn of the Court of the Political Resident by the Order as the 'highest Civil Court of Appeal'for the District would give the Political Resident the right to grant the political Agent unlimited powers as regards civil suits. There are a number of cases bwtween pearl merchants of more than 5000/- in value (15 in 1914). It would be impolitic to compel litigants to come to Bushire for suits of this description,ard it is hardly likely that the Political Resident could come to Bahrain to try them himself. Section 37 As explained in note to Section 4, it would be necessary to add:- (c) A dispute over accounts or wages between the owners, masters and crews of local sailing craft to the Salifah-ul- Dahri for scrutiny and adjustment,and for 'Salifah Court* in the second line of final para to substitute 'Salifah Courts *. It is the local custom in suits for or against the estates of deceased persons,absconders or bankrupts,which cases provide about half the work of the Majlis, when the books of the two parties do not correspond,and no evidence is procurable,to put the party who is present to oath,if be is a Muhammadan,in the mosque on a Friday before the Qazi; or,if he is a Hindu,in the temple before a Muki. The Hindu merchants make no objection to this oldstanding custom; and,as the creditors nearly always include both Hindus and Muhammadans,it is impossible for the ^ajlis, which includes a Hindu merchant,to differentiate between the tv/o religions. After 'to a Qazi' in the second place it is therefore necessary to add 'or,if a Hindu,to a Hindu driest'. Section 441®, Section 44 Vide note supra, it would be neceasary to add:- (d) Refer it to a Council of Elders or to Arbitrators for finding. Section 45 A para should be added relating to the Sallfah-ul-Eahrl. 45 (!) ( c ) and 45 (2) are baaed on a nlaoonoeption as tb the status of the Majlis-ul-Urf as at present constituted. The Wajlis is not a Court but an advisory body. It is quite incapable of passing a regular judgment,even if it were advisable that it should do so,and it would b« much more satisfactory to retain its present status. This can be done by altering the word 'decision' in 45 (1) (c) to 'finding', and altering 45 (2) to •The findings of the 'ajllS-ul-Urf,the Salifah-ul-r-haus and the Salifah -ul-Bahri ,when endorsed by the Politicii Agent shall be considered as if they were the decisions of the District Court'. This follows the wording of Section 44 (1) (c) of the 0 «der, Further suggestions regarding Civil Liaw . Cases occasioRally occur in which Bahrain subjects,who are apt to lightheartedly declare themselves bankrupt when in difficulties, and Hindu merchants having businesses both in Bombay and Bahrain,fail. It is advisable to make provi sion for concertedjaction by the Bombay and Bahrain Courts. Similarly much difficulty has been experienced in.adminis tering the estates of Bahrain and British subjects with businesses in both countries* Having had no experience of Administration or Bankruptcy proceeding in India, I hesitate to give an opinion base 1 , on the present prmctice in Bahrain, and would suggest that the Bombay Govermnent be consulted.If ■Iex cla/- c. •&gt; OC m ^L. Local Offioiala 0 Qazi Shaikh Jaaim 'bin Mehza haa been the ohief Sunni Qazi throughout the year. He haa tried a larfe number of oaaea at the Political Agent*a requeat with juatioe and deapatoh; and the good order maintained in Manama ia largely due to hia influence. Hia attitude during the war with Turkey ia noted below. Qazi Shaikh Khal4§), the Shiah Qazi, ia atill venal and dilatory. Muhammad bin Padhal, Sal if ah Judge, haa been -prompt and juat in hia deciaiona. Khalifah bin Mubarak, Judge of the Marine Oourt, haa given aatiafaotion in the few caaea aent to him. Ali bin Huaaain, the Amir of Manama, though extremely corrupt, haa aerved the Agency much better than former Amira and there have been no complainta of hia conduct in caaea in which foreignera have been concerned. The Agency haa much leaa to do with Pahad bin Abdur Rahman, Amir of Muharraq. What work he haa had to do for ua haa been well done. The fadawia aupplied by the Amira for the Agency Court have worked extremely well. T/ajlia 0 188 caaea were tried with the aaaiatance of the Majlia during the year. Moat of theae were in connection with the eatatea of deceaaed peraona, abacondera and bank- rupta. Thia work ia generally arduoua and complicated, but the reaulta have been, aa a rule, good though alow. The Majlia haa been relieved of a great deal of work by aending auita to arbitratora not neceaaarily membera of that body. Judicial 0 0 The judicial work in 1914 waa very heavy, eapecially during the Summer. In August aa many aa 235 Civil andand 46 Criminal oaoea ware instituted. The totals for the year were 1484 and 382 respectively, as against 787 and 355 in 1913, 518 and 203 in 1912 and 803 and 211 in 1911. 1214 civil suits were heard hv the Political A^ent without the assistance of the Majlis, Qazi or Marine Courts. 42 were nending at the end of the year, of which 33 are before the Majlis. 679 suits were settled by consent and 653 decrees were given. The Vernacular Office establishment consists of one Inter preter, one second clerk and one daftri, none of whom has any judicial training. As, in addition to all the judicial work and ordinary vernacular work, they have had to deal with 59 estates, make out 1391 Dassports and vise a great many more, it can be understood that the Vernacular Office is under staffed. Great relief has been afforded by the institution of a system of petitions. This was very unnonular at first, but the people have now become used to it. The large number of cases filed is due chiefly to the bad season and to the increase in the numbers of foreigners, but a small anparent increase is due to execution cases having been registered separately during the last half year. The value of suits instituted varied from Re. l/- to Rs.41000/ the total value of suits for the year amounting to over five lakhs. A large number of suits have been instituted by Turkish subjects and one by a German subject since the out- breal. of war with those countries. In fact the proportion of Turkish suits has been higher since the war began. The following table gives the nationality of litifrants:- Persian 1083 Manumitted slaves 46. Turkish, 526 Somalis 21.

Theae two heada account for 39 and 159 casea reapectively, but litigation of thia sort is now severely discouraged- There were 75 cases of theft, 58 offences againat local lawa, and 28 maritial disDUtes.

This to my mind is rather a fundamental difference between the two bodies though they both are advisory. However it is beside the point, as the I'ajlis have been consistently referred to as a Civil Court since the very first draft order in 1910, and no one has ever taken exception to it; I do not think {nor does Sir Percy) that we can go up for an alteration now between the time of the official public ation of the Order in the Gazette and its introduction. What I should do myself would be to treat the ''a J lis exactly as it has been treated hitherto and suggest an alter ation In the definition and the offending section either when the question comes up in a case, or in a year or two when we are suggesting amendments in the light ot experience# 2. sir Percy certainly ^ave me to understand that t va in tended to Introduce the Order as gradually as poss^bl®. The word 'gradually* is mentioned in the office notes though not In Sir Percy's, as he writes 'We have discussed th»s mattar' etc. In his letter to Foreign Sir Percy says 'It (Order) might be brought Into operation as unobtrusively Major T.H.Keyes, I.A., political Agent, Bahrain. — --ttVfru 1 J 'hipossible'. This implias(to ray raind) gradual introduction as if every letter of it was introduced ait once and enforced forthwith it could not be introduced 'unobtrusively 1 * • It appears that we do not agree as to the meaning of th© word •''egal' which I used in the sense of 'According to law' i # e« some recognized code of laws, such as Roraan # British, Dutch, Islamic, etc. The Shaikh is the Ruler and principal executive and administrative authority in the island, but not — to my mind - the source of law, the latter being the i rophet Muhammad and the Xagal gentry who commented on and (more or less) codified his orders and sayings. The Shaikh's actions against foreigners have ordinarily been by executive order at his own sweet will tempered by the fear of a gun-boat or (in the case of foreigners from the main-i land) of a raid. When questions relating to foreigners are dealt with by the Political Agent the Shaikh is relieved of his fears as regards gun-boats, etc. and of course tbe oli- tical Agent has not got them; but 1 do not think the Political Agent could therefore issue any order which the Shaikh might have issued against a foreigner from whose country or tribe he had no fear of reprisals. Still less do I think that si^ch orders could be considered legal. As a matter of fact the sentence out of my note which you quote was intended to refer to British law. Alter all a British official, if dealing with the subject of a foreign power - especially a European power - cannot take his autho rity solely from the Shaikh. A European Government if one of ; its subjects is to be tried by a British Political Agent instead of by the Shaikh would naturally claim that he should be tried in a legal manner and have the usual rights of appeal etc.etc. in lieu of the right which the Grovemmont had pre viously of ensuring a proper trial or of reducing punishment by its mere prestige, or by threats, or by despatch of a vessel etc. Incidentally I might add (although this is beside the point) that I think most European powers would say that the Shaikh of Bahrain had no authority over their nationals, and therefore could not delegate it to us. I do not t-4* Hi mill IT ' .&gt; not think they would object In principle to our assiimlng the right as the protecting power especially when it is a 'fait accor3pli f, # in any case it seems advisable to assume the power as quickly as possible. This question of an Order in Council has been going on for yascKH several years already - ever since about 1906. In regard to the three matters which you say the Political Agent cannot forego:- (I) Prohibiting foreigners from living in Bahrain, and deporting foreigners. We know of course that it was with the greatest diffi culty that His %je8ty , 0 Government agreed to include foreign ers at all under any provisions of the Order in Council# Every effort was made to get authority to deport foreigners, vide Sir Percy Cox^ letter M.48 of 15th liay 1912, and sub sequent telegrams, but without result. I do not think there was any correspondence regarding prohibiting foreigners from residing in Bahrain, but it comes in the same category and would not have been accepted. In these circumstances we shall have to drop the question of prohibiting foreigners from living in Bahrain or of fWinally f&gt;^oc-e^-5 deporting them by Judicial I do not, however, see any 'Express and specific pro vision incompatible with' your observing the old established custom of putting undesirable foreigners on a ship and re patriating them by executive order. I should continue to do it if 1 were you, but if you think It is illegal you could get the Amir to do the actual sending off. (II) Security fr'om foreigners without conviction. See my note of 5th May 1915. If a man is a bad character and the local authorities or Kazi recommend his being put on se curity I am certain that no objection would be taken. We have always found under the Persian Coast and Islands Order that 'The request of the local authorities 11 . If found on en quiry to be reasonable, is sufficient reason for doing any thing of the sort by executive order^. (111) ' I &gt;1 jII —. !/ (yrgih (111) Ma.111 a » As I havo mentioned above I think the Majlis should be treated eiiaotly as It Is now until the point Is raised, I should not think that you would find the Majlis trying to arrogate to itself any executive power. How could they enforce it? They can't do anything more than make re commendations as at present. The definition could be amended later, I see on reference to the old file that it emanated from here in 1910. In regard to the question of introducing the Order gradually. Of course the Order 'is brought into effect' from 2nd August, and from that date the whole of it comes into force. But as far as I know there is no reason why every section of it should be enforced at once and it rests with you how much you enforce straight off. There are clauses of the Persian Coast and Islands Order,fwhich has been in force since 1-89,^which so far as I am aware have naver been enforced. Innumerable clauses in many acts and some whole acts always remain a dead letter. ,u&lt;\ I am afraid the wording of my letter 877 and note of 5th ^y 1915 was rather loose, bu^ I was not expecting dia lectical discussions: possibly this letter is not much better. If so it is due to want of practice in such matters. As regards the Assistant, if you don't think the appoint ment necessary there is no need to get a man at present. You could wait till after the war when case work will probably increase again. To my mind ofie of the principal advantages of having a gazetted Assistant would be to have a responsible man to leave in charge to let the Political Agent get away for trips on /fifemainland etc. T ' ? ith the departure of the Turks no doubt they will be more frequent. I should think : r Inarn-ul-Huq the first Interpreter at the Agency would have a claim on the post if he wants it, and would be a suitable man. ' if iS' | IAJU -t. The Residency, Buehire, 2nd June 1915. Dear Keyes, I attach a note commenting on your note on the Bahrain Order in Council. As you see I think most of the difficulties can be avoided, for a start at any rate. Yours sincerely. I \Remarks on 'Note on the Bahrein Order in Council H by the Political Agent, Bahrein. Section The definition of Majlis el Urf could be amended later on if it is found that the present one gives trouble. The definition of Salifah Court is M a court of one or more judges who have a knowledge of local diving and customary marine law et cetera. It would appear that the Political Agent and Shaikh have power themselves to allocate one or more Judges to diving and one or more to marine if it suits them to do so instead of each Judge having to do both things. I think all that would be necessary would be that when making an order (for record) that (say) Muhammad Fazal and Kalifah bin Muhammad had been appointed Judges of the Salifah Court by the Poli tical Agant and Shaikh, an addition should be made that un til further orders Muhammad Fazal would hear the diving cases and Khalifah the marine cases. Section 14 . I do not think it is necessary to make an alteration. No trial by Jury or with assessors has ever been held under % the Persian Coast and Islands Order and I do not think it is expected. Section 20 . I see no reason to suppose that section 107 of the C.C.P (or any othor reotion except Chapter XXXIII) is ex cluded from the Orcier Article 11(2) of the Order and the Schedule applies V® ^ ie whole 6ode except Chapter XXXIII. If section 10? ^he C.C.P or any other section (except chapter XXXIII) were excluded mention would have been made in the schedule, as it is evident that the matter was gone into in detail from the entry re Bombay Civil Courts Act. Section 21 . It would be very desirable to substitute 'Person to whom■Jkm. A / whom this order applies' for 'British subject' , but His Maj esty 1 b government oould not be persuaded to do it. The only thing to do is to carry on as before: possibly after the war our position in respect of Bahrein will be a good deal firmer and then a proposal for amendments can be put up and this can be included. Possibly it won't be needed as ^iO'ths of the badmashes may / / have become British subjects or proteges. Section 22 . As for section 21. Further suggestions regarding criminal law . (a) Possibly after the Order has been in force a year or two some suggestions for amendment on lines proposed might be made. In the meanwhile in my opinion a good deal could be done by referring oases to a Kazi under section 14 - 2nd para Generally the parties are all mu&amp;ammadans and usually they can agree tc some Kazi who can effect a compromise. Otherwise when the parties come up,before starting on the case I presume there is nothing to prevent the Political Agent re ferring oa^e to arbitrators or Majlis for conciliation 'in the spirit' of' section 10 and if successful complainant could withdraw his petition . (b) . I do not think anyone will object if these rules are not adhered to absolutely to the letter. In any case which might reasonably be compounded, I should allow the parties to compo-ini if they wish to do so. Civil. Section 3^5 ( i) The Plstriot Judge in Bombay is the principal Court of original Jurisdiction in a district and hears appeals from Assistant Judges and subordiuate Judges etc. He can apparently hear suits up to any cunour^t. th^ only restriction being that he may not hear appeals from subordinate Judges in suits , the value of which exceeds 5 0 00/- , these must go to tlie High Court; € and (2) he may r .ot transfer smits of value of more than 10000 to his assistant judges. So the Political Agent will have full Jurisdiction. Section1 i-' Seotion 37 * If the 'Salifah Court' Id oonsidered to oonprise 2 branches one dealing with pearling and diving matters and the other with marine oustoms as boggested above this is unnecessary The amendment might be suggested later on with the others ; in the meanwhile as Ftated the Hindus make no objection, and as prima faoie the Hindu in any particular case cannot prove his contention by any other means presumably he will take oath ; otherwise the point will have to be decided against him. Section 4-4 . See above. A good deal can be done under 44 (c). Perhaps amendment could be suggested later with others. Section 45 » Uhnecersary as regards Salifah ui Bahri . The word 'decision' is used in Seotion 44 (i)(c) in reference to the Kazi's order in a case, and the same para implies that such decisions require endorsement by the Political Agent to make them valid. For the time bein^ it is advisable to assume that the 'aecislon' of the Majlis mentioned in para 45 (i)(c) is of the s^jime nature . It seams reasonable to suppose that its judgment', as mentioned in section 45 (2) , cannot be 'considered for all purposes the same as if it were that of the ri strict Court', unless it is approved by the Political Agent. If this is admitted, mattars can go on as at present but there seems to be no objection to proposing the amendments suggested later on, when point lias been considered whether it would affeoT# 45 (3) • Tiiis seotion seems likely to cause trouble but it is not clear how it can be altered. If any men\»ion is Liade of formally ratifying the decision of the Majlis the question arises as to whether the Siiaikh has not the right to do so too.eUSHlRE BESIDENCY. CONHUENTlAL RElORUS. ;j of 19 15.. F rom Major T. H. Keyes, I.A., P olitical A gent, Bahrain. To Major A. P. Trevory C.I.E., '4 5 i Officer on Special Duty, B U S H I R E. POLITICAL AGENCY. Dated Bahrain, the 28th May «9l5 S ir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the fees to be charged under the Bahrain Order in Council. 2. The system at present in voguo is as follows:- In Criminal cases no fees are charged. In ordinary civil suits and in administration, and bankruptcy proceedings no fees are charged for any process, or for hearing the suit; but 1 ^10 of any amount paid into Court, or collocted by the Court or the local officials is paid through the Agency to the Shaikh or his officials under the name of ^hidma*. It is on this ^khidma' that the Shaikh chiefly relies for the remuneration of the Amirs ; of Manama and Muharraq and their fadawis. The natural outcome of this custom of only taking fees on amounts collocted through the Court is the following excellent practice: A man who has a claim against another puts in a petition: in about 50 per cent of the cases the claim is admitted, and a promise is made of weekly payments in the case of shopkeepers, or of instalments at one or other of 1of the aeaaona in the case of people intereated in the pearl trade. The time of the Court taken up by cases of this description amounts to a few minutes on each of two days and only a very small number of suits are followed by execution proceedings in which money is actually collected and ^hidma* paid. The total amount of ^hidma* paid to the Shaikh and his officials amounted in 1913 to R3.2,255/- and in 1914 to Rs.v5,708/- . This latter sum represents all the fees taken on suits of a total value of about Rs.5,00,000/- . It must be noted that ^hidma* is taken, not only when one of the parties is a subject of the Shaikh of Bahrain, but even when both parties are British subjects or foreignera 3. The institution of a regular and inelastic scale of fees on institution of suits, however light the fees might be, would inevitably cause a very considerable amount of discontent among people who have been accustomed only to pay for reault^and would tend to check these amicablo settle -ments. In the attached table I have suggested a form of fee to meet the case, i.e. a fee of Rs.2/8/- for decisions in suits settled by consent without hearing witnesses. I have also suggested a much lower scale for the fee on the institution of an ordinary suit than is taken in Bushire i.e. Rs.2/8 per cent as against 3 annas in the rupee, but I have suggested R3 .7/8/- per cent as a fee on amounts collec ted by the Court. These three provisiions, while upsetting local custom as little as possible, should brin^ in consi derably more than the present 'khidma' . The same principle has been followed in suggesting fees for administration and bankruptcy proceedings in which ^/lO T khidma 1 is now taken. The other fees suggested are modi fications of the Bushire scale calculated to suit the poorer classes in Bahrain who provide the majority of suits. The t forma pauperis t clause is taken from Section 61 (2) of the Order in Council. I have excluded proceedings in which Bahrain subjects are concerned from the list of fees under the headings nrrt1narv1 Ordinary Suits* , Probate and Administration' and 'Bank- -ruptcy and Liqudation* but consider that Bahrain subjects should pay all other fees. This question will be dealt with in para 5. 4. It is impossible to estimate with any confidence the amounts which will be realised by these fees. In 1914 2872 summonses were served through the Shaikh^ officials, but this was a year of excessive litigation, and it would not be safe to estimate the receipts from summonses at more than Rs.1,000/- The system of registration in vogue before 1914 makes it almost impossible to compute the money value of all suits during a year. The value of suits during 1914 amounted to 5 lakhs, but the fees on the estates of deceased persons and bankrupts were formerly included in the 'khidma' and it is now impossible to separate all the accounts. Not only was 1914 an exceptional year from the point of viov of litigation, as several large pearl suits were decided in which Bahrain subjects were parties, but the imposition of a fee on the institution of a suit will tend to reduce the number of suits filed, and I do not think that we can rely nr receiving more than Rs.2,000/~ per annum for fees for in stitution, and for decisions without hearing witnesses. Pees for execution proceedings will diminish, not only on account of the reduction in rates from Rs.io/- to 7 A b /- per cent, but on account of the exclusion of suits in which Bahrain subjects are parties; and R3.2,500/- may be taken as a fair figure. If we take Rs.500/- for fees under other heads, the total estimated fees will be Rs.6,000 7 - . This is of course exclusive of fees taken in cases in which Bahrain subjects are parties. 5. There remain to be considered the principles gover ning the Shaikh of Bahrain's right to fees levied by the Agency Court, and the rights of the Agency Oourt to take fees from Bahrain subjects. It must be remembered that the Agency Court possesses no process servers and that all summons etc are served by the7. the Shaikh^ officials whoa© rarauneration ia largely drawn from fees received from the Agency. The only adminatrative functiona performed by the officiala of the Court are:- Sealing of premiaea making inventories of effects conducting aalea. keeping poaaeasion of effecta. We muat now aak the Shaikh to forego the ten per cent T khidma' on all suite in which both partiea are either Britiah subjects or foreigners- As regards suits in which one party is a Bahrain subject it would be desirable from the point of view of uniformity to have the same scale for theae suits, but the idea of taking a percentage of the claim in advance when the Plaintiff has possibly no chance of obtaining the full amount of the claim, or haa no in tention of sueing for execution, is so foreign to Arab ideas of juotice, that I would suggest that 'khidma' be levied as heretofore in all cases in which one party is a Bahrain subject, and paid to the Shaikh. If this principle be accepted it will only remain for us to compensate the Shaikh for the loss of 'khidma 1 is suits in which none of his subjects are concerned. Of the Rs.^,700/- which he received in 'khidma' last year Rs.396/- was received in|cases in which his subjects were concerned, leaving R s.^ SIS /- received -.n Bri .is v and Foreign cases. I would therefore suggest that I may be allowed to offer Shaikh Isa Rs.500/~ per mensem as compensation for loss of *khidma* in Britiah and Foreign cases and may inform him that 'khidma' in other cases w/ll be paid to him as here- IB tofore• 6. As regards registration, in view of the poverty of the Persian and Ottoman subjects who form a large percentage \ of the persons to whom the order apnlies, I think that Re.l/- on registration and -/s/- on annual renewal will be suffi cient .7. In conclusion I think it advisable that the sug gested scale of fees should be introduced as a tentative measure, and that a report should be submitted after a complete years working, i.e. after Ist January 1917.

The case will have to run the gauntlet of the Foreign Department, India Office, Foreign Office and Treasury, ana, from what I know of that last abode of avarice. It win be necessary to maxe out a very strong case to get them to pass the low fees suggested. ShalXh Jaslm has Just been conducting a campaign against 'khldma', which he says is contrary to Shara, so we must expect a great deal of opposition to even these low fees. I hope that, in forwarding the case, you win make a strong point of the feeling against fees for hearing as opposed to 'khldma 1 for extracting money, and also of the poverty of the greater number of litigants. The total of 1 money values* is very high, but 15 pearlx cases in which Bahrain subjects were Interested accounted for nearly half. The administration report, of which I sent you a copy with a former letter on this subject^gives most of the'Information you will want for putting up the case. I doubt If the fees win be sanctioned for six months, and the greater the delay the better,^It win give U b people time to get accustomed to the more regular proceedings under the Order before they are confronted with another Innovation.Subsequent to your note of 19-4-15, considerable correspondence took place between the Political Agent,Bahrain and myself on the subject of the Bahrain Order in Council, which nay be found between pages 187 and 213 of file 18/55 if you feel disposed to read it. It is quite unnecessary to v ' 0 ' J ' vvr, as the whole difference can be summed up by saying that the '.A's opinion was that on the introduction of the Order- in-Council every letter of it is law and must be enforced and nothing which is not mentioned in it can be done; whereas my opinion was and is that whereas preriously there was no legal authority for any of the Acts which the .-olitical Agent, Bahrain, did, (except when acting as a 1st class agistrate in a case against a British Indian bubjoct), in future he will hare the authority of the Order in Council for doing a great many of them. I have not cor- virced lajor Keyes, but I think I have shown him that quite a number of tilings laid down in the Persiar Coast and Islands Order \n Council are a dead letter, and that lots of things are done oy custom, usage .or suffxrance for which there is no ai.ithority therein. It&gt; has been agreed (1) That the King's Regulations introducing the pilgrim ships Act shall be similar to the Persian Coast and Island one mutatis mutandis. (3) That no other kinds of Regulations will be necessary at present. In /h-- s letter dated 2 c th 'ay 1; 15 Political Agent, Bahrain has put forward his proposals for the Rules of Court for iii Lroduct_ on of Court fees, and his views recording the aj ^ s 1 r h. As regards Khidmah S^ajor Keyes'proposal is (vide para 5 of his letter' 1 that he should be authorised J o pay t^e ijliaikh Rs. 500/- per mensem ir lieu of .'hidr-ih,- • in cases between foreigners and between British subjects and foreigners - in cases in which Bahrain^is tfU concerned he . proposesproposes to pay the Shaikh Khldmah as usual. Rs.oOO/- a month is a liberal allowance as the Khldmah c 1 1 cto(i drrinf 1913(_a good year)was only Hs.SSPR/- and in 1914 a year o:' excessiye litigation 58.3708/- out of which R s .39C|/„ were fees on cases in which Bahrain subjects were inrolyed learing Re.3313/- Khidmah on other oases. but _ thir.k it will do no harm to offer a liberal sum. Unless oh; EVaikh can see from his accounts (which is un likely) what he received in prerious years and io know that he is getting a good bargain, he will be suspicious that we are trying to do him whatever we offer. If the Shaikh will agree to settle the Khidmah question a lump sum monthly it will be a good thing. —I cannot find any special discussion of the Xhidijaah question on the files. I thought there had bee; some, and so did you.- V/hen I was at Bahrain I went into it to some extent in connection with my proposals for cr-eass in establishment, but apparently the point of com- li pensating the Shaikh was not raised. ] : &gt;• the actual fees .'ajor Heyes has drawn up a ^cale which he proposes as temporary measure^ a report to be made after a complete years working, h'i^ 'ropobed scale oi xees is a ver^'' low one# On lie other hand the scale of fees under the Persian 0attach 0 d} Coast and Islands Order is a rery high one, and quite un- suitanle-- as I found in liuhammareh.for poor litigants. Of course fees under Orders in Council such as the Persian Coast and Islands would ^ally be high / be-- based on the assumption that the British and British Indian subjects making use of them wo^ld all be well to do, and able to afford litigation as a luxury; no doubt there is the secondary consideration of reducing litigation with which Consular C^nj-ts are not, as a rule, yery well qualified to deal. In order not to upset local custom Major Keyes suggests (i P aj ' aG 2 and ) of his letter) that a fe© of H s .s/p /- only should be charged on suits settled by consent, as so many ar^, 1 agree that this is a good idea.s I must oay, however, that, eren if the foreigners in i_ i.-,, ^ '•' ■' , aiiii most Ox tlten are, litlpatioj ought to ba oonsidared a luxury in Bahrain and not, as at presen ^a recreation. On account of there being no fees at all charred in criminal ca-ass there^Tersians who had had/slan^in^ match in the street used immediately to rush and file complaints against each other. They would not be in such a hurry if they had to pay something for the summonses. In regard to registration it is correct that the foreigH- ero in rain are poor but as the meanest cooly ca.n earn a rupee or more a day, I think erery one can affoBd Re.l/- xor registration and for renewal as under the Persian Coast and Islands. As a corollary of the above remarks I put up herewith an alternative list of fees, based on the list of fees in the HaJiMai Rule of Court published on October 20th under the i ersian Coast and Islands Order in Council - as I under stand uniformity isa-desideratum I have made an exactly simi dr rule 01 Court vithe scale of Tees reduced. the .fi large number oi/iin fees will be useless and never onfcreed exactly as is the case under the Persian Coast and 1 b lands Order, but I think there is no harm in having them in — one may at a^y time desire to an objectionable litigant in al-^ the fees isaccaHz one can. In regard to appeals I see no reason why a man should not pay icr the luxury of appeal unless he is a pauper in which case P.A. can exempt him under Article 61 (2) - Appeals are in my opinion to be severely discouraged. If any one ( a highly unlikely oontingenci^e) wishes to go in for for the extra special luxury of an appeal to the Privy Council he ca ~ pay the s'l^e fees as are charged under the Persian Coast and Islands. I attach a copy of the King^s Regulation a'nT)lying the Pilgrim Ships Act to the Persian Coast and Island an exactly similar one changing names where necessary can issue under the *the Bahrain Order. I cannot trace any other f£big 9 8 Rorulations mclify- mg any other Acts for the Persian Coast and Islands and so there seems to be no reason to modify them for Bahrain. P.S.

Oraiit, C.y.I., C.I.ii., Foreign Secretary to tx^e Government ol India in tie Foreign and Political Department, T&gt; zl Ki m Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to your letter Uo. 354 Q. dated 23rd March 1915 on the subject ot tne Bah rain Order in Council and the drawing up of a draft Kings Regulation on the subject of alterations as may be required with respect to Bahrain in the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act (XIV of 1895) which has been applied to Bahrain by the Order in Council, and of otner Kings Regulations if necessary in respect of other enactments included in t^e schedule of the Order. 1 2. A draft Kings Regulation amending the Indian Pilg±im Ships Act is herewith submitted. I have consulted the Poli tical Agent, Bahrain, and come to the conclusion that,at present. Kings Regulations are not required in respect of other Acts, as it has not been found necessary to introduce any such Regulations under the Persian Coast and Islands Order-in - Council. 3» The onl3 T further action necessary is to issue a Rule ofof Court prettorlbiiig X ,: jb ^ourt Feea to be levied ia the Court at tii® Politiott-x a^erxt, diid of tiie apolitical Residerit in tae i'exBiaii Gulf. I imd Bona oorreaposidence wit a tae Political Agent on tae subject tmci he hfwi Bubnitted Ma viev/s together with a draft foe table in Ms letter xio . - dated 28tli Maj- lylS, of v /hich I encloise oopj' for tiie Information of t*ie Govern ment of India. Att ttome of tiie feea proposed by Major Keyes appeared to xae to be too small, and the iom of iiis fee table not quite b-ie same as usual and not quite complete-I tiierefore drew Up onotaer 'fee Table' and mmto&amp;mtd the waole case to Sir Percy Cox. Owing to Ixia multifarious duties find frequent absence from Basrah he lias not been able to go into tiie matter and t.^e mattex % has been returned to me for submissicn to Q-overnment. I accordingly submit a draft Fee Table herewith for consideration. I agree with Uajor Keyes that tiie scale of fees under tae Persian Coast and Islands Order-in-Council is too liiga for Bahrain, and it will be seen taat I have in almost every case reduced t..e fee. I do not tliini&lt; how ever tiiat t.^e fees should be reduced too low, as that will encourage foreigners in Bahrain to continue their present litigious aabits. Under existing circumstances t..ey fly to tae (?ourt arid file a suit about t.ie most absurdly trivial matters• I have suggested fairly high fees also for appeals as in my opinion it is not advisable to encourage these. The fees suggestec. are not prohibitive and persons who are not in a position to pay t.^em will probably be able to appeal 'in forma pauperis*. 5. The question of compensating the t&gt;la?ikh for the loss of 'Khidmah' or or commuting it to wliich tiie Political ^gent, Bahrain, refers in Ms letter is rather a difficult one and Sir Percy Cox will himself address tl^e Government of India on ta* subject in due course. 6.

In these circumstances I venture to suggest tiiat perhaps t^ie Q-overnment ot India might consider tne question whether it v/ould not be better to make the 'Indian court Fees Act 187^ applicable under all the Orders in Council relating to tae Persian Gull via # t;ie 'Bahrain Order in Council 1^13', the 'Muscat Order in Council ff 1915' and the Persian Goa«t and Islands Order in Council 19C7, It appears to me tiiat in many ways the introduction of the Indian Court fees Act would simplify matters.

Please see telegrams exchanged between Captain ^Ison and myself On 4th and 5th October last and my letter to Government dated Ist November JIo. 2120. In para 5 of this letter, 1 have stated that vou will address Government on the subject of compensating the Shaikh for loss of Kliidmah'after the introduction of the Order in Council. Major Kofea* views on the subject are set forth in para 5 of his letter without number, dated 20th 'ay 191.^. 1 agree with ajor Cayas that it is advisable that in cases A(here a Bahrain subject is involved Khidmah hould be levied as formerly at the rate of 10 f, as formerly. I was under the impression that the question of Khidinah had been thrashed out some years ago but I cannot find any record that it was. :.or does there appear to be any record as to how the Agency Court started paying Khidmah to the Shaikh at such a high rate. I imagine, however, that the practice simply grew up as in the local Courts the Shaikh was in the habit of collecting 10 Qiidmah from any sums realised and that it was thought ( and rightly no doubt) that the shaikh would demur less to the transfer of a large proportion of his Judicial rights to the Agency Court, if lie received his usual fees. i ajor Aeyes estimates the annual receipts fr«om Khidmah, less that on cases in which Bahrain subjects are involved,' at about F' 5,600/- per annum and suggests that we should offer the Shaikh h 3 500/- p.m. as compensation for the loss which will be incurred by him on the introduction of the new sytstem. I think this proposal is a good one ' tfiidrah' having been recovered and paid to the ohaikh for years we cannot ignore his claim to compensation. Besides this as .^ajor 'eyes points out the process serving and other services for the Agency Court have bean done by the 3haikh'e officials. Very badly it is true until the retirenent of the old 'Amir of Manama''-while he was there, 4 olitical Agents anxiously awaited the time when the Court could have its own officers— but matters are better now. In any case allI A all proceaaea to ba served outside the actual town of Manctfi^ would have to be dealt with by the Shaikh's officers. If it is agreed that the best arran/rercent is to corapourd with the Shaikh about the Khidmah it reraains to be decided 3ik win her ve snbuld address Government at once making the su^rgestinn to offer the Shaikh 300/- p.m. in lieu of Khidmah, or whether be:ore doing so we should ask Major ^eyes to sou^d the Shaikh ^ on the subject. Iossibly the latter course would be best^ as we should look rather foolish if the suggestion was sanctioned and the Shaikh • ;* proved obstinate and declined to accept the arrangement. i •e might of course if we adopted the other method tell the ohaikh tiiat the time had arrived for a regular Oourt and that in regular Uourt a fixed scale of fees were chafed in all countries, that when once we started regular fees it would be impossiblejto levy Xhidmah in addition, but that a careful exa- rl] Bushire, 2?&gt;r(l Jecember 1915. II 5! - minatlon c. the accounts showed that in years of much litigation ^hidmah on suits In which Balirain subjects wRre not involved av-b- ragedl r . 3,600/- per annum, and we had therefore decided to pay him this sum regularly monthly at 300/- p.m.. We might add that J J tto originally the practice of levying Khidnah which is opposed to the practice of British Courts grew up without the sanction i of Go/ernaant, but Government did not wish him to be a loser by the introduction of somey^legal methods and so offeread 300/- p.m. an compensation. He could then take it or leave it. 1s *• ♦ Telegram. En. cl. From - Trevor, Bushire. To - Sir Percy Cox, C/o'Lawrence' Bushire Radio. No.1411, Dated 28th December 1915.

To Foreign DelhiC ffd- ) No. 9-B.7 Dated 3rd January 1916, Secretary of State has power to authorise further post- ponement to 3rd rebruary 191/. In this connection please see Residency letter No. 21^0 of 15th November 1915 regard ing Bahrain Order in Council. The attitude of the Shaikh and community is at present so *' satisfactory that I would wish to avoid all developments likely to disturb it at any rate till the end of the war or till we are firmly settled in Baghdad, ''hen the Order is first introduced temporary friction is almost sure to arise, owing to various sr.all local issues due to it. I think the questions raised in Trevor's letter No. 2120 might now re- / ceive attention, but I recommend that the powers of post- i.' 1 ponement possessed by the Secretary of State be utilised for i 4 another six months or possibly till February 1917. n Cox. i .99 70.
