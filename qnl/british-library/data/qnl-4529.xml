Dear Wakefield, I would be glad if you would ask the Bahrain Petroleum Company whether they would agree to one of their tankers taking a few packages for me from Cape Town to Bahrain? I should be much obliged if this could be done, and if you would kindly send me an air mail letter, c/o Thomas Cook &amp; Son, Durban, letting me know what the position is. In extremis,! may ask for a passage on one of their tankers for my self, and would be glad to know what their attitude would be regarding this, I should, of course, be only too pleased to pay whatever the amount came out at. N 1 My present intention is to return by air, but one cannot, of course, tell how air passages ^ . q will work out in three months time. ; 7 , J-./ n It was very good of the Company to agree to take my two packages from Suez to Bahrain, and I would be glad if you would kindly thank them in my Yours sincerely,P»0&gt;Ho#C/1165 . The Agency, Bahrain, the 4th Auguat 1942 I have seen Ward Anderson about the matters you mentioned in your letter of 16th July. 2. First, you asked whether the Bahrain Petroleum Company would agree to one of their tankers taking a few packages for you from Cape Town to Bahrain. They will be very pleased to do this, and are cabling their South African agents to make the necessary arrangements. Ward Anderson suggests that you should, in due course, get in touch with these agents (Messrs. Caltex (Africa) Ltd., 140 St. George's treet, Capetown) and let them know how many packages are to be sent, where they should be collected etc. I gather that the Company could probably collect the packages either at Cape Town or at Durban as might be convenient to you. 3. I also asked Ward Anderson whether they could help you with a passage on a tanker if you were unable to find other means of transport here. He said Yes; but if the con tingency arose would you cable to him here in Bahrain so that he could make the necessary arrangements. No 'Passage fare 1 would be payable and only a nominal charge for food and incidental expenses. I hope, however, that you will be able to secure a speedier and le«s uncomfortable means of transport. Yours sincerely Lieut.-Colonel C.G.Prior, C C/o Thomas Cook &amp; Son, Durban .Ik D.O.No.0/1166 . The Agency, Bahrain, the 4th August 1942• This is to confirm my conversation with you on 3rd August, when I asked, on Colonel Prior 1 s behalf, whether you could kindly transport a few packages for him on one of your tankers from Cape Town to Bahrain* You said you could manage this, and would in form your agents in South Africa. I am telling Colonel Prior of the address of your agents and am suggesting that he should con tact them about detailed arrsngeoents. 2. I also asked whether, if Colonel Prior were unable to obtain any other means of transport to Bahrain from South Africa, you would be able to give him a passage on one of your tankers. You replied that you thought there would be no difficulty, and suggested that Colonel Prior should cable you if, in emergency, he required this facility. 3. Colonel Prior haa also asked me to thank you for so kindly agreeing to bring some of his kit for him from Suez to Bahrain. Yours sincerely. 1 ard P.
