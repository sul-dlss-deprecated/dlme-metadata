These instructions were in a letter (No. 1020 of 1821, from F. Warden, Bombay Castle to Henry Meriton, Superintendent of Marine). If a Boat will neither show its colours nor come to it should be fired over. If there are good ground for suspecting a vessel to be a pirate it could be fired into. Register and port clearances could be called for; if there were irregularities then warnings could be given.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023694713.0x000004#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
