Sir, I hare the honour to report that Mr. E.T. Cadden, a recently dismissed employee of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. at Qatar, refused to leave the peninsula and conducted himself for a time in ^manner dangerous to peace and good order. Fortunately 9 Mr. Cadden eventually decided to leave Qatar quietly, but had he not done so it would have been necessary for the Political Agent, Bahrain, to deal with him under the Qatar Order-in-Council, and to enforce any order that he may have passed. But to execute summonses or warrants or to make an arrest in Qatar the Political Agent has, at present, no suitable functionary. 2. It is, therefore, necessary to provide the Political Agent with the executive means to meet future breaches of the peace and, for the present, it would suffice if the Political Agent, Bahrain, were empowered to ap oint approved members of the Company's staff in Qatar as Special Police Officers in the same manner as has be^n done in Bahrain - vide King's Regulation No. 2 of 1926 under the Bahrain Order-in-Council, 'The Special Police Officers' Regulations'• I enclose for allowance by His Majesty's Secretary of State a draft King's Regulation which it is proposed should be made under Article 83 of the Qatar Order-in-Council, 1939, conferring such powers on the Politics] Agent, Bahrain.
