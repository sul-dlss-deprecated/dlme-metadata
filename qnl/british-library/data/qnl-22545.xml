D.O. NO.C/53X. (D The 23rd of May, 1946. Dear Colonel Hay, I unders that; the Naval Base may be closed down within about six weeks and that no decision has been arrived at as to the disposal of the buildings, plants and machinery 2. As regards the buildings. The clerks of the Bahrain Agency are very hard put to it to find accommodation in which to live, and I shall be grateful if I could be given an opportunity to take over suitable buildings at the Base for staff living quarters. As regards the plant and machinery I understand that the A*I«0*C. are Interested In taking then over and con tinuing to operate them, if this could be arranged it would be suitable from many aspects. The water distilling plant plays a very big part in our life in Bahrain and I believe the new electricity generating set depends upon it for its supply of cooling water. This situation will maintain until the State's new 10-ton set arrives. This may happen sometime this year. Yours sincerely, The Hon'ble Lt-Col. W.R.
