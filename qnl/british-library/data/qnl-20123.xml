Knowing I had heen in that part of the world, he asKed me al)out the place and I have told him what I know, Ke is Captdin A.R. Conder M.C. of the 4/7th Dragoon Guards. He is now on the reserve of his regiment, and has for the past three and a half years 'been re-mount officer to the Iqta^i Levies. He has had four years service with the Indian Army in the S &amp; T Corps. He is single and 37 years of age. With the redaction in strength of the Iraqi Levies, I gather a numher of their officers will have to return to their regiments, or, if on the reserve, find other employment. Conder is anxious, if the opening offers, to endeavour to get into the Indian Political. He has passed the colloquial examinations in Arabic and Pushtu, and has a good worKing Knowledge of Hindustani. I got to know him last August, when we did two mountain treks together. He is very smart and generally considered to be extremely efficient in his work and as a soldier. He is generally liked by everyone here at Mosul, and would, I am sure, get on well with anyone with tihom his duties brought him into contact. He is a fine horseman and keen and goc&amp;i at nearly every out-door sport. He realizes that the life at . Bait-al-Falaj will be lonely, but feels able to cope with this and ia not afraid of the climate. Knowing that the nominee for this appointment has to meet with your approval, I hope, Sir, you will not mind my having thus written to you, I am pretty certain that you would approve of Conder if you knew him.

I cannot definitely state what the allowance was but am under the impression that it was in th© vicinity of Rs.350 per mensem* Captain Alban, the last Officer to combine the two duties had a basic pay of Ru«5 7 5/- and was drawing Rs• 130C/- psr mensem* Captain Albans relief was asked for with th© especial proviso that he would not combine th© Office of Finance Minister with Comrandant of the Levy. I also have no contract to carry out these extra duties and as the Finance Minister will be absent for at least eight months I request that I may be granted an allowance of Rs • 300 per mensem during the time act•—— *1 ■* c * ^ ' ' - ' ■' i^-1 act as Officiating finance Minister, failing which I regrat widldo not 300 my way to continuing in th© capacity after ths end of September 19 I have ^he honour to be Sir. , Your obedient servant-* 1 Captain. , Commandant.

The above letter which is similar to that circulated in the Indian Army when recommendations are asked for in connection with the above appointment has 'been obsolete in many of its paragraphs for some years and requires reframing. I give below remarks on each paragraph and suggestions for consideration. (1) Pay. There are now two rates of pay prevailing in the Indian Army known as the 'old' and 'ne?/ 1 ; Pay of rank plus Rs 400 applies to old rate only. lew rate is comprised of Pay of rank, I.A. allowance,lodging allowance*and marriage allowance. % Sii §r total sums of the two rates vary slightly according to seniority. Suggest Hew rate should be inclusive of above plus Rs 400 less lodging allowance as quarters are free. ( This is being drawn at present but should be shown in Circular sent out by Army 11.Q.) (2) Leave. One Month Anualxy. In view ox the fact that the hot weather is severest is insufficient .Indian officers and all ranics are granted two montns. vide Fundamental Rule Ho 62 and Govt. 01 India's dec ision in amendment Eo 138 01 6/5/27, a mixitary officer lent to the Civil Dept. for a period of ^nder three and reverting to military employ at the end remains under Military leave rules which is .normally, two months'privelege leave per annum.

During the service of an officer with the Levy Corps he may be entitled to furlough 'before joining it,having served 53 months since return from his last furlough. On the other hand the period of two years he serves is insufficient to earn him furlough.

The former enunciates only the general f \ if O^i&amp;J ^ '' f ' rj, principle governing leave admissible to Military officers .. &gt;' u t y r*: employed temporarily in the civil Department and the latter h- actually prescribes the various kinds of leave admissible to such officers. From the latter rule it is clear that Captain Walker 1 s claim to privilege leave under Military rules is not in order. 2. It is however considered that the climate of Muscat is such that no British officer can remain there for 11 months in the year without loss of health,vigour and. efficiency. This fact is recognised by the practice of granting to officers stationed at Muscat permission to recess for two months at least in the year at Karachi or elsewhere. The Political Agent enjoys this privilege, and the newly appointed Financial Adviser has been specially allowed to do the same. 3. Service with the Muscat Levy Corps is classified asid as n foreign service'; and in cases where military officers are employed on foreign service the terms of their pay, leave etc., are settled individually for each case in con sultation with the State concerned. In the present case the Muscat State has accorded its approval to the grant of two months 1 privilege leave every year to Captain A.R.mlker. 4. The Grovernment of India have accordingly decided to alter the terms of Captain Walker's appointment so as to permit of his taking two months 1 privilege leave annually and I am to request that in paragraph 2 of the memorandum from the Government of India in the foreign and Political Department Ko.314-A/28, dated the 29th January 1929, for '(2) Leave-one month's privilege leave as laid down in Article 247 G.S.R.' may be read 'Leave -two months' privilege leave annually as sanctioned 'by the Muscat State under ti Fundamental Rule 123.

After compliments. With reference to my conversation with Your Honour this morning in which I informed you that I had received a tele gram from the Hon'hle the Political Resident in which he asJced me to inform the Council as follows:- 2. The Government of India propose that Captain Alban should remain on at Muscat as Financial Adviser and Commandant of the Muscat Levy. This arrangement would be provisional until the Political Resident had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Council during his forthcoming visit when full consideration would be given to the Councils views. The Political Resident proposes that Captain Alban should receive as allowance Rs.200/- as Financial Adviser and Rs.200/- as Commandant of the Levy. The total cost to the State, including this allowance and pension contribution would be Ra.1,735/- per mensem or Rs.20,820/- per annum. 3. You replied that it might be difficult to provide the funds to meet Captain Albany pay and that you would prefer to reserve your final opinion until you had an opportunity of discussing the mattet with Colonel Biscoe on his forth coming visit. 4. I accordingly telegraphed the result of our conversa tion to Colonel Biscoe who has replied to the following effect^. 5. He hopes that the Council will reconsider the matter. He points out that the financial year will shortly come to an end. The budget therefore must be now under preparation, and Colonel Biscoe feels that it is very desirable that the Al.ban* s council should have the benefit of Captain/i advice and assist ance at this time, and that he should stay on in Muscat until he - Colonel Biscoe - has had the opportunity ©dT discussingTranslation of s letter dated 23rd Jamadi al Thani 1550 (5-11-31) from the Council ©f Ministers to H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat, to Major T.C. Fowle, H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. ip'\ After Compliments. At sn auspicious time we have received your letter lifo.C-260 dated the 4th November 1931, read it with pleasure and interest and noted what was stated by you regarding the telegram received from the Hon^le the Resident in which he asked you to inform us that the Government of India propose that Captain Alhan should remain on at Muscat as Financial Adviser and Commandant of the Levy (to the State of Muscat and Oman), that this arrangement would be provisional until the Resident has had the opportunity of discussing this matter Y /ith the Council on his forthcominf visit, and that the Resident proposes that Captain Alban should receive as allowance Rs.200/- as Financial Adviser and Rs.200/- as Commandant of the Levy. From your letter it appears that the total amount which he should receive is Rs.1735/- per mensem. You state that with reference to our conversation on the subject, you wired to the Hon'ble the Resident the summary of our verbal reply (para 3) for which we thank you. e noted the Resident's reply to you as described in (para 5) and thank His Honour for the same. i In reply we request you to inform the Resident that we have reconsidered the matter and we are glad to accept the proposal of the Hon^le Government and of the Resident which we know is to the advantage of the State of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. But we wish that this matter be kept pending the arrival of His Honour at Muscat when we shall have the pleasure of meeting and discussing with him this and other matters.}iv 2 As pointed out to you and as it is not Hidden from the Hon f 'ble the Resident and yourself, the fimancisl condition of the State of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman is at present more serious than anticipated, and it is due to the decrease in the imports and exports this year. Though the necessary economic measures were taken in reducing the pay, etc. from July last, the financial condition has not improved. We are sure that the Hon'ble Government will not agree to any thing contrary to the interest of the .State. It is not necessary to go into details ss the monthly statements of accounts make this point clear. A8 you have 'been informed verbally we have commenced preparing the new 'budget for 1932, and further economic measures will be taJcen in hand to reduce pajr, etc. with effect from January 1932. Tith great pleasure the draft budget which is under preparation will be snown to you and should you have any suggestions we shall consider them with pleasure. We have to point out that the amount of allowances referred to by you would overburden our State and render the present financial condition more serious, our chief object being economy. In the circumstance we request and hope that the Hon'ble the Resident will reconsider the proposal and look to our present financial condition. As you are aware the President of the council of Ministers is now in charge of the finance; this is due to the financial crisis. We are awaiting the arrival of the Hon f ble the .esident at Muscat when we shall have the pleasure oi discussing the matter with him end therefore request that the matter be kept in abeyance at present. We request you kindly to inform the Hon'ble the Resident accordingly. U.E.I/I D. 0. Muscat.

In addition to the terms demanded by him, the State would be required to pay usual leave and pension contributions in respect of him.

Fo 1 * considerable periods I commanded the 1st Batta lion, Assyrian Levies, both under peace and war conditions. Buying my service with Levies I have had a good deal of experience of civil administration duties as much of my work has entailed dealing with problems concerning the Assyrian civilian dependants of the Levy Force. This work has in cluded financial settlement plans, land settlement, village planning, road making, and the building of three permanent c amps. As regards military administration it will be seen that long periods of my service have been spent in holding an independent command and also as Adjutant. I am much interested in the type of work involved in the administration of such forces as the Muscat Levies and have proved by experience that my ability and temperament is suited to these conditions. Before making formal application for your approval to my appointment to this post I desire to study in dGtail the terms of contract and compare them financially and other wise with the appointment I at present hold. In this connection Col; Aldworth is kindly arrang ing for me to visit Muscat by air shortly in a R.A.F. duty plane. I shall then see for myself the local conditions and I hope it may be arranged for me to have a personal interview with' the Sultan. When the date of my visit has been fixed I will advise you by wireless signal so that you may give me any instructions you consider necessary. If there are any further particulars you require I shall be pleased to furnish them. Thanking you for the information and consideration you have already extended to me in this matter.

I am sorry that we have not written before to let you know what we have been doing about this. I £ow enclose copy of a letter dated 20th toy to the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and War Office, which is, I think, self-explanatory. As explained in it we had postponed action because we had had reason to hope that we might get a suitable ex-Indian Army Officer, but he in fact proved to be unwilling to consider the appointment. £ke Foreign Office promised to let us have a list of officers, several of whom, it appears, have the Arabic language qualification and type of experience which would be likely to fit them for a post such as the present, which they drew up in connection with the Assyrian troubles. The Colonial Office have not so far tr been/ Hon'ble Lt.Col. I.e. Fowle, G.B.E. , Bushire. r2 - iDeen a'ble to help, and I feel rattier doubtful whether we could expect much from them, judging from the difficulty we had in dealing with po sts of a similar type at Aden. The War Office may he ahle to do something, hut have raised one or two points, e.g., whether the contract will 'be a five-year contractj whether a married officer would he suitable for the appointment, and whether, if so, he would he given Passage for his wife; the number of Europeans living in Muscat; whether personal stores would he duty free. 4. Perhaps you could send us two lines to explain the position as regards the points raised hy the War Office, prima facie , I should have thought there would oe advantage, as the pay is not very high, in appointing a bachelor. You will remember the trouble we had over Hedgcock, and in any case I am not quite sure that the State contemplate providing the type of quarters suitable for a married couple. 1 am not quite clear as to what the position Is in regard to the period of contract. Are we correct in assuming/^ ] IS 1 - 3 - 0 r assuming that tlie contract would be for three years in ohe first Instance, or Is the period five years, suoject to a break in respect of leave? in either event I take it that we should be justified in taking the line with any prospective applicant that, subject to his proving suitable and to his being willing to continue in service after expiry of the perioa xor which he is engaged, we, in the interests of preserving continuity, would probably be quite prepared to consider the idea of an extension. 5. We will continue to press the other Departments and will do our utmost to let you have something further in the very near future, 6.

Watson, the Financial Adviser, expressing the hope that it may he possible to find employment in some branch of His Majesty^ Service for Mr«Gr.B. Humphreys, O .B.E., whose present appointment under the Egyptian Government terminates in April next. 2. As explained by Mr.Watson, Mr.HtMplxeys, after 8 years' service with the British Army, was appointed in August 1922 to the Egyptian Ministry of Finance to administer the pension fund which was created out of His Majesty^ Government's gift of £E.960,000, and was to be expended in relief of the dependents of the members of the Egyptian Labour Corps and other locally raised units. In this capacity Mr.Humphreys has done exceptionally good work under very trying conditions and it is almost entirely due to him that the administration of the pension fund has been carried out so efficiently. In administering the fund Mr. Humihreys, though an Egyptian Government servant, has, to a very large extent, been working in the interests of His Majesty's Government, since it was in order to fulfil the latter*s obligations to those Egyptians whc volunteered for service during the War that the fund was created. That these obligations have been so faithfully liquidated and that the many complications which are inherent in transactions of this sort have been so successfully surmounted is due in large part to Mr.Humphreys personal efforts® , Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.G.S.I., K .C .V .O., M.P., etc., etc., etc.3. I feel, therefore, that in view of the fact that his services were virtually rendered to His Majesty^ Government and not to the Egyptian Government, Mr.Humphreys is in a different position to the ordinary British official seeking employment on the termination of his contract with the Egyptian Government, and I trust therefore that every effort may be made to find him a suitable post in one of His Majesty^ Departments* I have, &amp;c., (Sgd.) PERCY LORAINE, High Commissioner*ministry op pinmgs, gaiho, December 8th, 1931. Dear Sir Percy, i am writing to ask whether you would be kind enough to use your influence on tehalf of Mr. G.B. Humphreys who will ne leaving the Egyptian Government Service at the end of April 1932. Luiiiphreys had. just started inlxisiness when the war 'broke out. lie enlisted in September 191i+, served in Prance, Gallipoli and Egypt, where he was given a Commission in the Egyptian Labour Corps. In 1920 he was put in charge 01 the office in G-.H.Q« which dealt with the payment of compensation to members of the Egyptian Labour Corps. In August 1922 he was selected for transfer 1 o the Egyptian Government to administer the Pension Pund, created by the British G-overnment 1 s gift of £E. 960,000, for the Labour Corps, Camel Transport Corps, and other locally raised units. hurnphreys has thus been in the Egyptian G-overnment Service since August 1922. His salary from that (Eate till Ouly 1929 was £S.792 and since August 1929 has been £S.86U. During this period of nearly ten years Humphreys has done exc optionally good Y/ork under very difficult conditions. He has dealt with over 14-0,000 applications for relief, a very large proportion of which were fraudulent and he has been seriously handicapped by the interference of His Egyptian Chiefs and the inefficiency of his Egyptian subordinates. Through all this he has always kept his end up and I think it may be safely said that almost » Excellency eVery/ ^ir Percy Loraine, Bart, k. g.m .G., The Residency, Cai ro.ao every genuine application has been successful and that it xs entirely due to his personal efforts that areat Britain's obligations towards Egyptian volunteers have been faithfully fulfilled. The value of his services was recognised by an O.B.E. in the last Honours list. m live months time Humphreys will be out of a job and my object in writing is to ask whether you will recommend him for employment with the Colonial Office or in any branch of His Majesty's Service. It has occurred to me that the introduction of tariffs may have created openings in the Customs. humphreys is 43 years of age and married, but has no cnilaren, and is ready to go anywhere. He has recently been pao-^ed as a first class life for insurance purposes. He nas a fair knowledge of French, German and Arabic , a sound training in office routine, statistics and records and is a good organiser. I should not, in ordinary circumstances, feel justified in asking you to make any special ©ffort on behalf of an Englishman who is leaving the Egyptian service and I only do so in the case of Mr. Humphreys because he has been working here in v/hat are really British interests and has done his work exceptionally well. Yours very sincerely, (Sd) P.P. WATSON.GOLOMAL OFFICE, DOwNIINFG STIIEET, S.W.I. 1006 Proms. S8th June 1935. i ,.•« Dear fait on, A Please refer to your letter P.b.5555/35 of the 30th of Maj about the post of Comm&amp;ndant of the Muscat Infantry. Blotter understands from Laithwaite that in his opinion candidates for the vacancy should be between the ages of 30 and 35. If those limits are to be strictly applied, I am afraid that we have no one to suggest who has any knowledge of Arabic. But, since E.C.H.Alban (who will be 45 next month) was apparently considered by Powle to be a suitable selection, it may be worth while to give you particulars of three people noted here whose ages are between 35 and 45. The youngest is Captain .v.E.N.Growdon, who was employed with the Police in Iraq from 1920 to 1933. He was born on the ^7th of January 1899; educated at Torquay Grammar School and the School of Science and Art, Paignton. From 1914 to 1916 he was articled to a firm of engineers, and from 1916 to 1919 he served in the Amy and the Hoyal Air Force. At the time of demobilisation he held the raak of Flight-Lieutenant; in December 1919, he entered the Metropolitan Police School (Peel House), and the following year he was appointed an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Iraq. He y /as promoted to be Commandant of Police and later to be Inspecting Officer of Police; during 1931 he attended the Senior Colonial Police/ Walton Esq., C.B. ,M.G./ &lt; 5fv / Police Officers' Course at Scotland Yard. He speaks Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and French, and, when he was axed in pursuance of the policy of the Iraq Goyernment of reducing the number of British officials in their service. Sir Francis Humphrys stated that he was very keen and efficient and would, he felt sure, prove to be a valuable acquisition, then last we heard of him in September 1954, his address was Beech Farm, Eobertsbridge, Sussex. The second nsme on our list is that of Captain R, kead, who was born in l^ew Zealand on the ^8th of April, 1895. He was educated at Bournemouth School and Lniverbity College, Southampton, remaining at the latter institution up to 1914 when he proceeded to India with the Territorials. He was on active service in Iraq, and in 19^0, soon after demobilisation, was appointed Assistant Political Officer there, being transferred to the Iraq Police on the 1st of April 19E1. His contract for service with the Iraq Government expired on the 51st of May 1951 and Sir Francis Humphrys then said that his excellent record of service with the Police in Iraq should eminently qualify him for a police appointment under the Colonial Office. He can speak Arabic fluently. We have not heard of him for some time and the best home address that we can give is 59 Methuen Head, Bournemouth, though he gave as a later address c/o Messrs. Thomas Cook &amp; Son Ltd., Haifa, Palestine. The last nsme is that of Captain A.F. Miller, born on the 20th of April 1890; educated at Parmiter's School, Cambridge Heath, until 1908 v/hen he became Secretary in the Ottoman Consular Service. He remained with that service/service until 1914 when He joined the armed forces. He was iidjubant, Middlesex fiegiment, and later an Intelligence Officer. He 'became Commandant of the Kirkuk Levies in 1919 and assistant Political Officer in the Kirkuk District the following year, the title being changed to Administrative Inspector in 1925. His appointment in Iraq terminated in 1931, and wlien last we heard of him he was employed by Fowler and Company at Bagdad. His record is good, and Sir K. Cornwallis in 1951 reported that he was a hard and loyal worker who had performed very valuable sei vice in Iraq. He is a first class interpreter in lurkish, out in papers here has not mentioned whether he knows Arabic. Yours etc., (3d.)

Yesterday's up Slow Wail, since it is being deflected to Sohar to drop the Sultan, would not have caught you but an excellent opportunity has occurred today in the arrival of a British ship the w City of Qiristiana'. This ship is leaving this morning and proceeding straight to Bahrein. I am therefore sending you by the hand of the i^aster a copy of my D.O. mentioned above ? so that you will be able to know the exact terms when inter viewing any applicant in London. 3. The Sultan just before he left told me that he particularly desired whoever was selected to take up the appointment in^October when the Sultan will be in kuscat so that he can see the Officer and explain his wishes regarding his duties, etc. The rion'ble Lt-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.Eo Political ''esident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•IHOTS. A Major G.B. Wheeler of the 7th Rajput Hegiraent was sent to see me today by Major Lindquist of the A:nny Headquarters in connection with the post at Muscat. Major Wheeler has not taken the War Block terms but I understand that he is eligible ana not anxious to remain on in his unit despite the fact that the Army are prepared to retain him, and he wants to get some interesting post where he could serve for the next few years. He has spent most of his service in the Intelligence in various billets, one of them being Military Attache at Meshed. I under stand thskz he is married to a Russian wife and that this was a reason why it was not found possible to retain him in Meshed. 2. Major wheeler is an excellent linguist and is a first Glass Interpreter in Turkish and Urdu and a Second Glass Interpreter in Persian and also knows some Russian. He has not qualified in Arabic and is unable to speak it, but he tells me that he can read classioial Arabic, though with some difficulty and he is confident that he would soon acquire a fair collouial h knowledge. There can be no doubt that Major Wheeler could leam Arabic, if he was given an opportunity, very rapidly, and he appeared, as far as I could judge in the short time at my disposal, quite a suitable person for Muscat. He is going to think over the question of retirement from the Anay and if he decides to proceed with the question of Muscat he will send a formal application through the proper channel. I explained to him what the terms were and he appeared to think that they would sui t him. ■Ill f? til x Sd/-G.G. Prio 10- 7»3i* ■35/144. /££- A ii 1 Telegram I.W.C.

Possible candidates were from the Iraq Levies and units of the Indian Army. The Sultan wished to have a young officer with Arabic language skills and experience of working with Arabs. Due to the state of Muscat finances there was uncertainty as to whether to appoint a commandant to the Muscat Levy Corps. Letters discuss the combination of the post of Financial Adviser and Commandant of Muscat Levies to be approved by the State Council and Sayid Sa'id bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr]. A further idea is to have a Royal Engineer Sapper Officer who would also be able to advise on the construction of roads and other engineering schemes.Correspondents include Captain George J Eccles; Captain Allan Robertson Walker; Captain Roderick Lewis O'Connor; Captain F M Booth; Captain Brian Carver Rigden; Captain Dorien Dudley H Johnston; Captain Horation John Hare; Major Reginald Merry; Major Trenchard Craven Fowle, Political Agent Muscat; Major Claude Edward U Bremner, Political Agent Muscat; Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, Political Resident Persian Gulf; Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman; Charles Walton, India Office, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commander of the Muscat Regiment</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ad#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
