The head is modelled in great detail. The ears flare considerably. The eyes appear to be closed giving the face an unusual expression but possibly the details of the eyes were painted. There is no modeling from the neck down and no arms are indicated neither is there any trace of an inscription. \r\nThe sculpture is made of the usual Nubian sandstone of coarse texture. The entire piece was overlaid with a thick coating of gesso measuring about .3 cm in depth. This was brilliantly colored and although most of this coloring is now gone a few vivid fragments remain which are sufficient to establish the original decoration. The exposed flesh was the usual dark red, but the cap or headdress was brilliant blue while the body or base from the neck down seems to have been red. The stucco has deteriorated extensively and there is large gap on the back. The head and body were found separately in a private house at Sesebi but there is no doubt that they belong together. \r\nCondition: The entire surface is weathered and the left ear is broken, the nose chipped and the neck restored. \r\n\r\n", "medium": "Sandstone, gesso, pigment", "dimensions": "10 7/8 x 6 7/16 x 2 7/8 in.
