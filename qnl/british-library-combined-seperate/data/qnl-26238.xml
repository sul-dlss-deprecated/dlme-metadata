                           Georgianaproceeding to Mussendom.News from Bushire includes a spate of robberies which affected Mr Hayward and the Apothecary at the Telegraph Station which were committed by Persian Soldiers and which the Governor ordered those affected be compensated for their losses.Other news reported includes arranging for mail from Tehran to arrive in Bushire in time for the steamers to Bombay; a report from Colonel Kemball to the British Ambassador to Constantinople on the
                           Highflyer's proceedings at Kateef [Qatif] and on Sayed Salim [Salim II bin Thuwaini] and his proceedings in negotiating with the Wahabees [Wahabis] and seeking help from the British whilst also being believed to have shot his father in order to obtain power.The letter goes on to report on Edwards observation of customs for Nao Roz [Nai Rouz] and the Governor's apparent implication that Edwards should have waited on the Governor instead of sending the Mirza, to which Edwards concludes that as the Governor has been supportive of the Residency that he will pay him a visit should an appropriate opportunity arise. He also reports that he has been unable to sell any of Pelly's stores as the Jew who intends to purchase them cannot have Beer in his stores during passover, but will do so once Easter is over; he also reports on Aboo Esau [Abu Esau]'s visit to Bushire and that he will return once he has taken pilgrims to Mecca.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189687.0x00001a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
