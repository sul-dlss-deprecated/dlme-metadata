Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith an interesting report by Mr. Squire, Counsellor at this Legation, on the vexed question or the xaaaa acquired by the ex-Shah in the Shahabad area. This has for years been one of the principal tribal grievances in Kurdistan,and, along with other lands acquired by the ex-Shah, is the subject of a special law which is still under consideration by the Persian Government. 2 * I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to the Government of India, to Bagdad for the General Officer Commanding the Tenth Army and to His Majesty* s Consul at Kermanshah. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. oir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) A. HOLMAN.

I have just visited SHAHABAD, my object being to study on the spot the AMLAK question in general, and in part icular, in view of many complaints^ that we must at once make at least a start with returning tribal lands, to see how far this question affects the tribes. the 2. The area of^SHAHABAD Parmandari is considerable, stretching about from KEEMANSHAH on the East nearly to the IRAQ frontier in the West, - (Qasr-i-Shirin is just outside the area). Very roughly, and excluding isolated areas else where, it is divided into 10 BAKHSH. The attached statement gives a rough idea of these, and of how and from whom the lands were acquired and how, when the new law is passed, they will be disposed of. 3. There are, of course, many problems, mostly arising out of the fact that the cupidity of the Kurds has been aroused and their demands are and will be impossible. E.G. (l) The Kalhurs, I believe, claim all the Palezi’s for the last two months has just finished its task of taking over the property from the military officers who have been hitherto running the estates as under the old regime. It will now have to administer them until the restoration has been effected. It’s immediate problem is, of course, the harvest. Obviously the proprietors* share of the crop must be taken over by the Government and the proceeds kept in de posit for the rightful proprietors. I propose to take this up with the ministry of Finance, At present wheat is being rapidly smuggled into Iraq and sold there. 5. It will be seen from the statement that the only person whose case needs immediate attention is AMIR MAKHSUS (v) who has now lost the lands in PARS which he received in exchange and has nothing to live on. The other*had a^least some compensation. Something must be done for Amir Makhsus. 3* 1 should perhaps add a note on Naft-i-Shah. The land was apparently sold to the ex-Shah for one ounce of sugar by Ali Agha and then leased for 60 years (payable in advance) by the Shah to the Oil Company, - a nice nut for someone to cracki V. The chief question here, as elsewhere, is security . A good Farmandar is an absolute necessity. Col.Fletcher says he must not be a soldier. The Ustandar f s solution is Amir Makhsus with Ali Agha as his assistant. Col.Fletcher disagrees violently. Shahkakhti wants to put in a Col.Tabatabai. I am putting my money on Col.T. He, with Shahbakhti behind him, is more likely than anyone else to be able to control the place. lands. (2) Kurds, who have been given lands in exchange. want to keep their new lands as well as get back the old. (3) Kurds, whose lands were formerly Khaliseh (Government owned) now want proprietary rights. 4 A Government Commission which has been at work8 -/ Bakhsh: - r nxf \ '&amp; 3 H A H A B A D B9TATEB. ^ 1 O' i ^ i 3 d 2 . _ 1 , „ Former Owners:— How acquired:- v — 1 'KoH to be disposed of: — 1. 3HAHABAD (48 villages) 3/5th Palezis purchased at fairly reasonable ?to be sold back again, price 2/5th Several small owners (not necessarily Kurds) ' at a low price to be returned, mostly free? 2.

KHOHRAJISHAHR, 19th May, 1942. _ iy E: (is) i My dear Sir Reader, w/ * £ tv e-v-A 'fv , 4 Please refer to xoHr_No. 14_5A5rim-(448/30/42), dated 19th April 1942 regarding tribal policy. I have had several discussions *ith the Q-ovemor. When I asked him what orders he had received and what action he had taken, he showed me a Circular from the Prime ?;Iinister in which the latter referred to the speech he had made in the Majlis and in which he was now instructing all Oovemors General and Oovemors to take action accordingly and inform the public. The Governor then showed me the office copy of a circular he had issued to the Bakhshdard of Abadan and Shadegan for circulation among the Arabs. This referred to claims relating to landed property only, and when I asked if the Commission could receive and consider any other claim or complaint, the Governor replied that its functions were limited as far as he knew to claims regarding land. He stated that he had no instructions to form a commission locally nor did he know of any being formed in Ahwaz, but all claims would be sent direct to the Cornmi gsion in Tehran care of the Ministry of Justice. Later he modified this to the fact that claims could be sent through him. The Governor also stated that to the best of his belief no claim existed in his district and that it is his opinion that the orders really refer to claims of the Khans of Pars, Bakhtiari, Mazanderan, Turkoman, Kermanshah and Khorassan. I told him that that might be so, but that it would be good policy to make any reform Introduced by the new Government as well known as possible and that I, anyhow, had been quoting it to every Arab I met as an instance of better days to come under the new rdgime. The Governor agreed, and so I asked him how, besides his circulars to the Bakhshdars, could he Vive this and other measures more publicity. He said he could issue notices and leaflets and get the various departments to make verbal announcements. tffhen. I suggested the use of town criers he anpeared to think it a good idea, but after a visit to Ahwaz to see the Governor-General a few days later, he said he could not introduce a measure which had no precedent. I told him that I thought this was a great pity but so long as things get the publicity that was their ^i^ n °t see that the actual method mattered at all, but should watch with interest the efficiency of his. I could not help harbouring the suspicion that for some reason the Governor—General and he did not really want to give the subject the publicity town criers would ensure. At all events I told the Governor that I was determined to give the widest publicity to this and all other matters requiring it, and should continue moving amdng the towns and tillages and into the homos of the leading personages, Arabs and Persians. X told him that up to now I was informing people of the improvements under the new rdgime but if he did nothing to secure publicity ^rom his side people would be bound to think it was all rhie to the British Government alone and, as far as this district was th P t ° hlm wherea8 it was my wish and hope Ho o 10 ™' P? figure-head and remain in the background myself, g ray Point and I trust he will take more action, but he is ant to e azj and ]et things slide, ftowever, he has been very firm in follcvir werfTnvol£f aP&lt;Ung th ? 1 f tting al0ne of the leaders ^ey imagined f.TdTPgd were tr y in S to involve in the recent rumours Of an rganiser. rising and the false alarms we had on the 12th and 14th April ■F 'Kr Since those days I have had a better opportunity of getting /getting among the Arabs who might have been concerned* There is no doubt Sheikh Chassib from Basrah had been trying to get them e'll to recognise him, but that is all # As far as Chassib is con- c ied he is regarded with mixed feelings here and more as an a&lt; *~nturer than anything else, and the Arabs of thisdistrict will cer-.^inly not gatherfto do anything the British disapprove of. #ith the development of Khorra»igha **» I am trying to get them to tender for contr^oto * to supply* coolies as opportunity occurs and I feeX;‘Fersldui authorities would be most illadvised to do anything no^ o conneciem with any past disturbances or fancied possibili uidtr' in fftnre. Reluctantly, at first, the Covemor agreed, andvlien demands by tiie Chief of Police from Ahwaz came for certain leaders to go up to Ahwaz, T had the greatest difficulty in making him exert his authority and prevent their going. It was patently obvious to me that the Arabs concerned (they were, by more than coincidence I think, iia* only the moneyed ones) were being called up on the pretext of being involved in the occurances of the nights of ICth and 14th, and would be made to pay fines or hush money. However, I succeeded and now that it has been insinuated that the Governor and my 1st Munshi have been taking bribes from these Arabs and so prevented their going up to Ahwaz, I am more con'inced and so is the Governor of the correctness of our policy, whilst the leading Arabs themselves are rea'ly beginning to cooperate with the Administration and become useful citizens. In this connection the recent removal of the local Rais—I—Amnieh has had a marked effect* Ve had the same tussle regarding the establishment of cabarets in Abadan and Khorramshahr* Twice these opened and were closed by order of the Go rr e mior, pressed by Bredge and then myself, ?uid each time they opened the principals declared they had the superior authority of : e Chief of Police in Ahwaz and Tehran. However, the Governor pre= vailed and at present the cabarets are shut. The Governor quite fornally thanked me at our last meeting for my advice to him over these Arabs and very graciously admitted that he had come near to making a big mistake in letting them be sent to Ahwaz. H© also thanked me for sending the Arabs to him without ostensibly interfering in their cases, so that his prestige did not become undermined. I assured him that so long as he took ju^t and adequate action, we could always work happily on these lines and was all xor seeing that he was Governor arid not T.t CYPjE5|%.

The Shah summoned me to interview this morning which was most cordial« Gist of the conversation was that the Shah since his accession had^in the interests of his country, thrown in his lot with the Allies. He had given instructions to his Government to co-operate as closely as possible with us. ; He hoped that we on our part would not interfere in the internal politics of the country and that if we were dissatisfied withthe Government and any of its actions, I would come to him personally so that we could settle matters together. He would not put in new Government unless he was sure that we had no objection. He had no intention of changing the existing Government in the present circumstances. He trusted that we would refrain from giving the impression that we could change the Government ourselves at will by our own means, othervise authority in the country would break down. He was always at my disposal whenever I wished to see him. I thanked the Shah for his offer of such close co-operation, which I warmly reciprocated. I assured him that it was never our intention to meddle in internal politics unless of course our vitally;fecattered)interests were affected. I added that the present Government was now co-operating closely and liquidating outstanding questions, and that I was sure that this was due to his directions.

There may be circumstances in which British troops would have to intervene to assist Persian Army to deal with rebel tribesmen, especially if latter refused to accept settlement with Persian Government on terms which we regarded as fair, and if Persian Army were unable to cope with the situation. . It is difficult to lay down in advance the circumstances in which our intervention in support of Persian Army should be accorded, and in our view it would be best to say nothing on the subject to the Persian Government at present. But I think it would be well to consider now whether such intervention should only take place in the last resort, or whether it would forestall serious trouble if we could intervene at an earlier stage and before the situation had deteriorated.

JJJJJJ I am seriously concerned at the effect here of secret Spldss transmiss ions in Persian by S.O.E . from Palestine. Notwithstanding directions issued by His Majesty’s Minister, broadcasts appear to have been phrased in an irresponsible manner and constitute an attack on members of''the' Persian Government collectively and even by name and a call on Persian people to revolt. From military point of view this is the last thing we want. The Prime Minister himself has complained to His Majesty s Minister, myself, and to other members of His Majesty's Legation. A^recent broadcast contained a personal attack on the osition is . _ -- resign. We should certainly not have singled him out for removal as he is generally regarded as pro-British. The Prime Minister has told me that Majlis are asking him whether this is the way the British treat 1 those who try to co-operate. 2. There is no (repeat no ) chance of British origin of these broadcasts remaining a secret. I am told that 70^ of the numerous people who are talking about it consider that we are peo^ o responsible; 20/ ; o think they come from Russia; Abadan, which is also under British control. 10% think it is 3. From political point of view here our position is made untenable if such broadcasts continue. I realise the failings of the present administration but latterly it^has proved far more willing to co-operate. If a change in regime is desired it is for us^to take the necessary steps at the opportune moment, but irresponsible undermining of the Persian Government by wireless stations is intolerable and might easily lead to its resignation, or to changes which we do not really want. Moreover it is bad for our prestige and for our future relations with any Persian Government for it to be generally thought that, if we want to plot political changes, we should be prepared to adapt such methods, and people are saying already that we want disorder in Persia. 4. Although arrangements have now been made that no directives to secret transmitting will issue from the S.O.E. involved, without the approval of the head of the mission or Charge d'affaires, I am personally of the opinion in view of the serious harm already done and danger of recurrence, station should 1 immediately be closed down at least for the present.

Principal authors of the trouble are four minor Kurdish tribes of, say, 1,500 men. Government has so far managed to keep ; more important tribes quiet, e.g,, one Shekak chief receives 5,000 toman monthly to maintain order with. 100 mounted men. „ Shiahs only.

Extent of damage has been exaggerated. There has been no massacre and only minor atrocities. First object oi Kurds was to drive away gendarmerie, then to disarm Shiahs and inevitably to pillage. Governor-General s first estimate of killed was five, Soviet authorities said that total, including Kurds and gendarmes, was between 30 and Aj and about 70 wounded. La.ter Governor-General produced police statement showing hundreds of killed, drowned and missing and damage amounting to 7,000,000 tomans m 156 villages, which I think quite unreliable. I favour Russian figures. After visiting looted villages I believe the majority of the villages can find enough food, animals, and tools to carry them over to the harvest though some will require substantial assistance. Gendarmerie posts only were burned e Rains have been medium and if work is resumed soon damage to crops will not be heavy. 5. /# e * J*» K I r 1 *•* / 2 . 5. Area affected is the valleys of Nazlu and Baranduz rivers and intermediate plain, but in the last few days local groups of Kurds have given trouble v^est of Khoi. 6 . Prime causes of the trouble were the collapse of Government power and distribution of arms amongst all sections of the community. Immediate cause was provocative and calamitous behaviour of Persian officials towards Kurds. Situation demanded firm control and impartiality from Soviet authorities but they failed to respond and to-day have no friends but the Kurds and other dubious elements. I think they, are now both ashamed and alarmed. Although »ftopy^werp^-i-nd and friendly they took trouble to fabricate evidence nor me.

During my stay they organised numerous road patrols and stopped Kurds from carrying arms in the townpfney said that they were taking necessary steps to prevent Iraqi Kurds from reinforcing local rebels while Governor of Khoi told me May 20th that at least one Russian soldier had been killed in engagement with Kurds. He was satisfied with Russian attitude. I hope that something may be [group undec:] encourage them to continue this course. 7. See my immediately following telegram.

The new Governor-General seems to be_a great improvement on his predecessors. He is conciliatory nrofesses agreement with the following views:- (a) Kurdish bolicv of the late Shah is not practicable in the Russian zone. If it is attemoted there will be complications with na |«n the Soviet authorities' and the Kurds, now friendly, may join the rebels. There is no genuine demand from the Kurds as ax{ ^ present divided, for independence, but typical Persian T repression mighl create it. The Russians a ^ f P|?p e p ersians making no real political progress nor will they if the Persians are wise. The Governor-General is coniident he can ^ach understanding with the rebels andhas[grp.undee.indlcated] his v/illinencss to receive the leaders. ihe rurKisn i . Consul tola me the lairds had sent him feelers for retreat into Turkey' in case of need (clearly he would offer no prospect of this)^ so I suggest he try to bring the parties together. * (b) Troops now on the way can have appearance^of coming to retrieve the situation created by Russian duplicity or mismanagement. Shiahs regard them as reinforcements in suspended battle and are trying to keep the villagers m town until they arrive. The Kurds are turning to the tribes now migrating from Iraq for compensating help. Governor-General agrees that hostilities must be avoided if possible ana asks that His Majesty's Minister support his telegraphic request _ that troops shall be under his control for [grp. undec.] policy. On May 18th I got him and the Soviet Consul to make arrangements for the return of villagers. The Govempr-General published stern notice the same evening and the Soviet authorities supplied escorts the next morning. Crowds pulled down the &lt; notices.demanding money compensation on the spot instead pi in the villages as offered, so few left that day, but I think the movement may increase. (c) . The Government would do well to refrain from rein stating the detested gendamerie in the Western i grp. ^ n £?c.] for the present. The Governor-General is disposed to substitute troops for these evei&amp;ually.

Above all, the troops should be symbolic merely. 8 . Background. Rezaieh is haunted by the memories and fears of massacre to the extent that few retain calm and balanced outlook. The chief of police refuses to leave his house for fear of Russians. The Turkish Vice-Consul^showed me in his bedroom machine-guns, rifles, shot-guns,^and several revolvers,; saying that he would certainly defend himself. French mi-ssipnanes* showed me bones protruding from the ruins of their former mission buildings as iustification for their viction that Christianif ie piper for opinions and threats. melancholy conviction that Christianity will eventually to pay the oiper for this.

The Soviet Ambassador told the Secretary of State on the 15th J/ny that he had been instructed to matce enquiries about the number of British troops now posted in and around Tehran. He was informed that there were’, a fortnight ago, approximately 1,000 British troops in Tehran and another 1,000 posted as military guards on the railway and elsewhere - 2,000 in all. ♦ In addition there were British units in the neighbourhood of Tehran. Since none of these troops were in our own area, V. Maisky asked Mr. den if he could tell him what they were doing there. 2. Mr. Cden replied that he had heard nothing whatever about these troops but that he knew that our forces in all Persia were in any event not very large. It was true that the Duke of Gloucester had recently perid a visit to. Tehran ond it might be that some troops had been moved to guard the railway or even the capital itself in connexion with the visit. Mr. Pden undertook to make enquiries and to let M. Maisky know the result. 3. We should be grateful if you would let us have material for a reply to V. Maisky.

Recent telegrams from Tehran and Tabriz show that the Turkish Consul at Tabriz, by sending home exaggerated reports and by encouraging his Government to believe that tne Soviet Government were largely responsible for the T disturbances, has done his best to increase his Government s fears ana to magnify the gravity of the situation. 2. Even if the Soviet Government are not entirely blameless, it appears e.g. froim your .tslg^pam No. 9^ [of the 15th May] that they have at least done their best to convince the Turkish Government that they have no sinister intentions.

He regretted the insertion in the aide-memoire of certain details given by the Chancollier but he was unable to ask his Government to make • light of the report as a whole, because he himself regarded the situation as serious. He could not acquit the Soviet authorities of at least passive encouragement of the Kurdish movement particularly by their long refusal to allow [grp.undec: ?Persian] troops to be stationed in Rezaieh.. He had pointed out to the Soviet. Ambassador that this refusal was contrary to the Tripartite Treaty and had failed to obtain coherent explanation. Worst feature in his opinion was -that the sufferers during the dis turbances were all Turkish speaking: Armenian and Nestorian villages had not been molested. I argued that even if this was correct it might merely mean that the Kurds wished not to be antagonistic to the Christians but the Ambassador was not convinced. Turkish Ambassador had also had information of the immunity enjoyed by the Assyrian and Armeniaruvillages and professes to — regard it as proof that the Kurds were acting under Soviet direction. I have no confirmation that these people were spared. It is inconsistent with the Russian attitude towards the lower classes that they should encourage the pillaging of towns. 3. I made the most of the fact that the Soviet authorities have now agreed to despatch of Persian troops to Rezaieh and of Polish [sic] Minister's arguments calculated to show that it 1 nECD. POL.

Mr. Cook had another long talk with the Turkish Ambassador to-day and will have helped I am sure to give him a more reasonable view.

Following is summary. 2. Outbreaks of violence by Kurds armed with rifles, guns and machine-guns have recently taken place in region between Lake Urmieh and Turco-Persian frontier. Local gendarmerie are physically unable to subdue Kurds and Soviet authorities of occupation forbid despatch of military forces. According to latest information Rezaieh has been surrounded since April 26th by Kurds who previously pillaged and sacked 360 surrounding villages with the aid of Assyrians. Soviet authorities did nothing to stop these activities and certain Soviet elements in them. Reports even state that Kurd bands are led by Russians disguised as Kurdish rebel villagers and equipped by Soviet authorities. 3. Armenians and Assyrians in Urmieh have been armed against local population and town has been barricaded by gendarmerie. *Thousands of refugees f4ffm Kurdish-AsSyrian terror' have demonstrated before Turkish consulate and described atrocities of rape, torture and pillage committed in their villages. 200 refugees have sought asylum in Turkish consulate and asked for admission into Turkey -and safe conduct to frontier; Turkish consulate has had to undertake feeding of refugees in consulate and in neigh bouring Mosques. ^ (Ends). 4. In conversation on May 7th Marshal Cakmak told Admiral Kelly United States representative that Turkish Government were disturbed by Russian refusal to allow Persian troops to deal with the revolt, they believed Russians were organising Kurdish bands and feared extension of Russian territory in frontier area. 5.

As regards food leaying Persia for Iraq., British Military Authorities have been authorised to export certain quantities of foodstuffs other than wheat. This may have caused some misapprehension. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently complained of the export of potatoes which was found to be part of the authorised quota. Although there have been one or two cases of abuse by Iraqi merchants posing as British army contractors, we have no reason to suppose that quotas are not being fully adhered to. Lack of control on Persian side of the frontier is one of the problems of tribal question generally. Responsibility is entirely Persian and neither we nor the Iraqi Government can be expected to interfere actively in this matter. 3. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation .absolutely denies having taken abay any lorries. Some cross the frontier e.g. to Khanikin but all come back. In the East of Persia E.P.a.T.S. have even brought in a large number of vehicles. 4. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have never 'used more than 1,0C0 out of the 5.000 available lorries, and most of the difficulties are due to shortage of tyres and spares which is a feature of the war situation everywhere. It will probably get worse. 5. hel ineff Commercial Corporation and military authorities^have also helped and latter have even transported troops for the Nevertheless we have done everything we can to with distribution of food, chief^impediment in which is licient and corrupt Persian officials._ United Kingdom Persian Government, gros s misrepresentation.

Extension of Lease Lend is another example of the common concern of the Allies to help each other/ v:e have linked the port of Khoramshahr to the main railway, a line of greatest economic value, and road and transportation work generally has given employment to many tens of thousands at a time when cessation of public works would have meant widespread ruin and even starvation.

To-day the news from Rezaich is very different. After apparent initial success the Ghazis seem to have failed completely and the general situation is said to be worse. More looting and more refugees are reported, and the Herki are said to have mutilated some women and committed other outrages. Chief of Police telegraphs that he cannot accept the responsibility for maintaining order. The Soviet Consul-General insists however, that most of this is pure exaggeration. The Governor General has at last decided to go to Rezaich tomorrow if the Soviet Consul-General will accompany him. The latter has asked the Ambassador for his permission. It is important that they should go and I think we may judge Russian good faith by their attitude. Only to-day the Soviet Consul General complained that the absence of anyone with authority in Rezaich was one of the chief causes of the trouble. Russians are reported to have suggested taking over the gendarmerie posts between Khoi and Rezaich. Persians say that this is one more move in the plan to undermine their authority while Russia continues to harp on the Persians’ inefficiency. I asked my Soviet colleague to-day whether, if the Kurds attempt to occupy Rezaich as the Persians fear, the Red Army would prevent them. He tried to rule out this possibility, but I gathered that Russia would not do more than prevent disorder. I do not think Russia can justify inactivity longer by pleading exaggeration. I think the Governor General is right when hV says they must choose between dispersing the Kurds themselves and allowing the Persians freedom to settle matters by negotiation or by bringing troops from the south. icidentally Russia says that there are 10,000 Kurds irrns but the Persians say that this is gross exaggeration j that the maximum is 1,500.FILE 'CorYCm (Y 2882/5/651) Foreign Office, S.W.l. 6th May, 1942. «,u j 942 xc&gt; 7 ^.

Minister of State’s telegram No. 484 [of April 26th] shows that your recommendation as regards retention of two Polish divisions in Persia is not acceptable to Commander-in-chief. If, as it appears, this proposal is ruled out, we shall have to leave to the Persian forces sole responsibility for maintaining internal security and for suppressing tribal disturbances. It is therefore all the more important to do what we can to effect an improvement in morale of Persian army and to proceed with necessary measures of re-organisation as soon as possible. If Persian Government decide to ask for American military mission, see my telegram No. 691 [of April 30th] I hope they will do so quic.kly, but even so no very speedy results may be expected and I shall be glad to hear if you or General Officer Commanding have any further suggestions for rendering Persian Army more capable of keeping the tribes in order. 2. I agree that our policy should be to press the Persian Government to declare their willingness to remedy any reasonable grievances of the tribes, and that we ‘should offer the Persian Government our good offices in /discussiondiscussion of land grievances with the tribes in the areas where our interests are affected. I agree that we must try to avoid undesirable responsibilities and in particular we must refuse to^ guarantee any agreement reached between the Government and the tribes. 3. I agree that it would be unwise to bribe the tribes to keep quiet. If you wish for special fund to be placed at your disposal for paying tribes for private services, you should submit further detailed recommendation. 4. Kurdistan. Now that fighting has again broken out, see Kermanahah telegram No. 23 [of April 26th], chances of a peaceful settlement are presumably more remote, but you may sound the Persian Government on the lines suggested. 5.

Such a proposal would presumably be most unwelcome to the Persian Government, and I understand that the Company do not favour it. 5. Pars. Your telegram No. 666 [of April 29th] shows that we may have to help Persian Government to prevent Nasir Khan getting too powerful, but I should like to be informed in advance of any steps which you may feel it necessary to take.EXT 2449 8&gt; 1942 In reply to the honourable deputy regarding the complaint v yloh are being uiade about their property by certain persons such as members of tribes and others, I taie this opportunity to declare that the views of the Government in this natter are as follows The Government, without any partiality, regards every Iranian as equal before the law and the administration of justice and has firmly resolved not only to pay attention to the genuine complaints of individuals and to compensate them for any injustices and oppressions they stay have suffered, but also always to try to provide the means to prosperity, progress and education for tribes men who are ready to be useful and active elements for the country and to taiee art in agricultural affairs in order that they may be able to live prosperously and comfortably, and to provide for them facilities for justice, education and health, as far as possible. If any of them has any complaint about his property instruotions have been issued that the Ministries concerned ehould examine such complaints seriously and with good faith, and moreover in order that the observation of formalities and administrative regulations may not cause delay in the matter and disappointment and discouragement, a special commission is being formed and special procedure adopted for the settlement of such complaints and the elimination of difficulties, and the Connies ion will investigate the genuine statements of individuals and rectify any unjust or oppressive actions. I therefore expect those concerned to profit by the good will of the Government and to express their clairas; and if any injustice has been formerly done to them they are to expect its rectification by the Government. But I deem It necessary to say that adventurous persons should not, under the pretext of rightful complaints, take action in illegal ways or make intrigues against the laws or cause disorder, since the restoration of security is given priority over everything by the Government, as defined in the Government's programme, and at this time when the country is short of foodstuffs and in commercial and economic difficulties, the preservation of order in the country is a vital matter, and I am sure that the deputies will agree that every patriotic Iranian should collaborate with and assist the Govermaent in the restoration of security.* e PILE ocpy No 111(76/17/42) With the Comvlim»nts of the Ufttler S*»wtof St4 te ^ A J j - /S4?

Among other things the programme which they have published states that the civil and penal laws applicable to AZERBAIJAN must be written in the Azerbaijani language and that a court of appeal must be set up in AZERBAIJAN in order that all the stages of cases can be completed in AZERBAIJAN. from the fourth class onwards, to be read as a subject; elsewhere again it is written that a provincial and tribal council must be formed having authority equivalent to that of the Majlis.

When I shov/ed knowledge of the other demands, he said that they were for discussion later and that the Kurds would not insist on them before dispersing. Conceding that the local authorities were inefficient and cowardly, I asked for his comment on the popular belief that the Red Army could disperse the Kurds at will.

I think that the Persians began by exalting as usual the seriousness of the Rezaieh situation m order to strengthen their case for getting Persian troops back there, but that matters have indeed become serious. I am assured that the Kurds have not yet dispersed, that thousands of peasants, some of them with their animals, who came into town,get hungry, that abandoned villages have been looted and many animals driven off, that as soon as there is a safe road there will be an exodus from R. to Tabriz. The Soviet Consul-General's report that the situation was quiet is not the whole truth. Shooting has probably stopned ? but the eroblem of re-establishing security remains unsettled. Apart from possible Axis intrigues the outbreak may fairly be attributed to the unpopular governor, now dismissed, and incompetent nervous gendarmerie. But the Russian military authorities dislike the armed gendarmerie and seem to have done nothing to support them.

I recently had a visit from air William Fraser, the Chairman of the anglo-Iranian Oil Company , who was inclined to urge that, in view of possible jBakhtlari unrest, the oilfields ought to have a i permanent military guard. Though there are troops at Diaful, I understand that there are none ne? r the southern oilfields. He represented to me that sabotage in the oilfields was very easy, and that while it waa very gratifying that adequate measures to guard the refineries, he was whether, under existing arrangements, the oilfields themselves were being properly protected. No doubt you have already oonaiderea this problem, but I should be interested to know if you think that anything could, or should, be dons to improve the security of the oilfields. / ' Brigadier ?. j*.&amp;.

General Shahbakhti has *[ grp. unde c. ] oroposed grievances (see Kermanshah telegram No. 43) ana has suggested ioint Anglo-Persian Committee. I am not at all sure what motives have orompted this offer as General Shahbakhti has in practice shown very little previous inclination either^ to co-operate with us or to appease the Kurds. Since this is first approach we have i haa from Persian side, however, and since it is supported by the Governor General (which may be good recommendation)_I propose to sound the Prime Minister on the lines suggested in my previous telegram and say I would accept it only on the following conditions: (a) Commission should be Persian*-Kurdish ano. a British representative would be only as friendly adviser ana go-between. „ T ^ . (b) Persian Government to guarantee safe conduct for Kurd negotiators with our concurrence. ^ . (c) Complaints *to be* limited to questipns of land, and questions in connexion with Kurdish independence _ would be barred. r rhis would not prevent our taking un indeuendently with Persia and without its being known to Kurdistan, any other reasonable complaints that might come to lignt. 3. Bakhtiari. Chiefs are asking for re-purchase of\ their oil shares as well as return of their lanas and appoint ment of a Bakhtiari Governor. Persian Government will presumably onnose the return of shares. Anglo-^anianrOil ^Conroany' s representative* considers Bakhtiari chiefs have very little/ \little control over their *ovm* tribesmen and,even less over more turbulent ones who are causing trouble at oresent and that military measures by either Persian or British troous would be more-effective method of^control* Return of oil shares would however giveBakhtiarr. chieis an interest in .orflpr in their own district ana even 11 they could not altogether prevent disorder it might &lt; discourage them'from promoting it, It would also give : us a considerable hold of them'* This is most important.

(Ple^ase pass to Kuibyshev as my telegram No. 140). The Prime Minister informed the Counsellor this morning that reports from Re.zaieh were again very serious. The town had been encircled by Kurds and 20,000 peasants had taken refuge there. The small force oi Persian^ &lt; rgendarmerie were quite unable to deal with the situation. The Prime Minister placed full responsibility for the state of things on the Russians, owing to their refusal^ to allow Persian troops to be sent to Rezaieh. The Prime Minister has telegraphed to the Persian Minister London and also spoken to the Soviet ambassador here but apparently so far with little success. The Counsellor aV the Soviet Embassy informed the Counsellor this afternoon that the cause of the trouble was the brutal and incompetent attempt of the local authorities to disarm the Kurds. The only course now open was for the local authorities to open negotiations with the Kurds for peaceful settlement. The Russian troops would not intervene except possibly to patrol the streets and re-establish calm. He had received a report from the Soviet Consul-General at Rezaieh stating that' the situation was quiet and he felt therefore that reports were grossly exaggerated. From past experience I am inclined to agree. I have asked the Consul-General at Tabriz for a report.] [Repeated to Kuibvshev as Foreign Office telegram No. 609.

F»o East year’s harvest m* Kurdish districts in Persia seems to have been good whereas in Iraq it v/as a total failure in many northern villages._ Until the snows closed the passes there was a good trade in grain brought in from the Persian side of the border and this did much to help the supply problem in north Iraq, without this Persian grain many villages would have been near'to starvation. Since the snows melted the import of grain on snail scale has probably been started again but will tend to uecrease if this year's harvest in Iraq is good. t would be a difficult task for the local Iraqi police-to stop this traffic, moreover, to do so would increase the supply &gt; problem in Iraq without easing the difficulties in Persia, as the grain brought into this country cones mainly iron Kurdish areas which are at present out of control and iron which it would be unlikely that supplies would be sent for sale into the undisturbed area. Pacification oi defiant Persian Kurdish districts seems to offer the best solution of the problem from the Persian point of view. [INDIV.] ~1 MAY 1942 INDIA omcBA.y.p.

Taqizadeii to Persia as Prime Minister]. I agree that the return of T[aqizadeh] as Prime Minister would probably be the best solution if it could be arranged. But the difficulties are considerable. T[aqizadeh] has twice made it clear that he does not wish to leave London, and the present state of affairs in Persia is hardly calculated to encourage him to change his mind. Moreover we are in a less favourable position now for raising the matter than on previous occasions, when Persian Prime Minister wished to resign, and it was a case of urging T[aqizadeh] to be ready to take his place. It would be quite another thing to do what is now suggested ? which amounts to telling T[aqizadehJ that we wish to make him Prime Minister by persuading his sovereign to dismiss the present incumbent and that we are prepared further to facilitate his task by dissolving the Parliament of his country. If, as is most probable, T[aqizadeh] politely declined our offer and reported it to his Government, it could hardly be expected to improve relations. 2. Meanwhile the departure of the Japanese Legation, the ® co-operative attitude of the Shah at your last interview (your s k/-to 1 ogram- Nei 5274-, the Government’s improved attitude over Axis sympathisers and the prospect of a solution of the currency problem with or without United States assistance now give hope of better relations. Though this improvement may be only temporary, the present hardly seems an opportune moment for us to try to induce the Shah to dismiss his Prime Minister and dissolve the Majlis. 3. While, therefore, I should welcome T[aqizadeh]'s advent to power, it seems essential that the next approach to him should come from the Persian side. If the Shah is prepared to make such £?n‘approach we could of course give it our full support.c 2 , /T~ 01 importing goods into Persia without payment of customs • \ . aues or other charges, their alleged purchases of foodstuffs C -- I 2 a - Cc&gt; - L ' b l e 1 or export to Russia, the prevention of the transport 2J i°od supplies irom the northern provinces to Tehran, and he continuation of _ their •propagandi-st •aotivi'd'ie's in Azerbaijan, uther complaints which I do not propose to pass to Soviet iimbassador refer to refusal to allow-Persian forces to be sent to iabnz or Rezaich, non-re lease of.

Police chiefs have received instructions to discourage it but the carrying out of this policy is being left too much to the discretion and energy of local officials. 2. I recently made representations to the Persian Government urging that the Government and press should adopt an openly pro-Allied policy. I also urged that an official announcement should be made that since Persia and Soviet Russia and Great Britain are Allies it is definitely^illegal to conduct propaganda in favour of the Axis or against the Allies or to conceal the presence of Axis nationals; and that the Police had orders to take action against offenders. 3. further urged that immediate action should be taken against any person guilty of such actions as the foil owing (a) Distributing pro-Axis or anti-British (c) Interfering with the sale or distribution of any newspaper or other published matter which is favourable to the Allied cause. (d) Spreading lies about the Allies, e.g. saying that the Russians and the British have caused the shortage of v/heat and sugar by buying up stocks. (e) Paying t money to induce others to engage in pro-Axis or anti-Allied propaganda. I have also_requested that the reproduction of Axis broadcasts in public should be yef more stringently prevented, (it is already forbidden). 4. The Prime Minister agreed generally with my contention that the Persian Government should show its hand clearly and should try to repress anti-Allied propaganda. At his request I communicated my suggestions to him in writing and I am pressing him for an early decision. At my suggestion the Soviet Ambassador has made similar representations* ) i' ^ literature. (b) Making the sign of the swastika in public 55. I have also requested, in the interests of security, that the carrying of wireless sets in private motor cars should be forbidden. 6. As soon as t'he necessary action is taken by the Persian Government, and I will do my best to see that it is taken soon, I propose to instruct all Consular Officers to re-double their efforts to see that local authorities carry out their instructions.

It is doubtful if Soheily will ever be able to manage the Majlis and^probably he will use it as screen whenever he wishes. Moreover his- conduct ih regard to Japanese Legation and six Axis supporters and his concealment from Shah that British and United States Governments regarded removal of Japanese as of extreme importance suggests he was trying to keep one foot in the ^Axis camp. I think therefore that we should make one more effort to secure Taqizade as Prime Minister. He is the only man about whose qualifications we, Soviet Embassy, Shah and Persian people are all agreed. Please see your telegram No . 352. .not repeated. Perhaps his health would be \ equal to the task if Majlis could be dismissed. I suppose you satisfied that he certainly would be co-operative. 2. As you know Majlis was nominated by the late Shah and enjoys no prestige while invalidity of its title probably induces it to be more nationalistic than a properly elected assemoly. No one but deputies themselves would regret dissolu tion which could be justified by change in regime, obstructive attitude about Firughi cabinet and especially (a popular point) by its slowness to deal with urgent bills such as those about hoarding and late Shell’s lands. Shah might be unwilling to mention invalidity of election as reflecting on his father but other arguments would be sufficient and public would supply the rest. It could be stated that new election would be hold but we could leave if lo 'Taqizade'not to hasten issue of writs. 3* ^ If Taqizade accepted on this condition approval of Russian and United States Governments would be necessary.

My telegram No. 1.21.. We have now discussed the question of our tribal policy fully here. Owing to the incompetence of the Persian authorities and ( weakness of the' Persian army it is clear that our policy of relying on the central administration to preserve order, as agreeu with General Wavell last September ( see mv telegram No. 888 of 191-1) has not succeeded fully, and if further disorders occur may fail completely. Situation is particularly difficult in *Fars :!: . 2. I therefore wish to make the following recommendations: f (a) Two divisions of Poles evacuated from Russia should be ( stationed near line of communication.. They should be armed and trained as soon as possible (Military Attach^ has already recommended this to headquarters of 10th Amy with my concurrence). These divisions would serve to stiffen the Persian forces if the tribes proved obdurate and force had to be used in the end., dhow of strength would also serve as deterrent to the tribes and make them more amenable to compromise. (b) In order to tide over the next few months, which will be the most difficult owing to the time needed for (a) to mature, I propose not only to press the Persian Government to improve on their tribal declaration but to offer the Persian Government our good offices in discussion with the tribes *in the areas* where2 . our interests may be affected, *of* grievances regarding lands, I would propose to press them strongly to agree and to let the tribes know, so far as possible, that I am doing so. Oriental Secretary knows of a number of real grievances in Kurdistan'and if these and others could be remedied by commission established under the Persian Govern ments recent declaration of tribal policy (paragraph 4 of my telegram under reference) and suitably publicised it would no doubt have a quietening effect. I have ■ ^deliberately used* the phrase 'good offices'' as we must try to avoid undesirable responsibilities. If you approved this lline I would tell my'Soviet, ^Turkish* Iraqi and American . &gt; \ colleagues, (d) [sic] Only hope for Persian Army sc far suggested ^-jis appointment of American advisers ( see mv telegram No, AlfO. As soon as departure of Japanese Legation is arranged I should like to *revert to* this strongly, 3. I am definitely against bribing the tribes to keep quiet. They are very split up and we do not know to what extent tribesmen would follow their own chiefs. It would [grp, undec.] expensive [grp. undec.] and would in practice mean aiming than, which would probably lead to their fighting amongst themselves and against Persian Government with whom • they have many scores to settle.

I am most grateful for your strong support. You will have seen from my telegram No. 466 that Persian Government have now given notice to Japanese Legation to leave v/ithin a.week, i.e. not later than April 20th. Probable procrastination of Persian Government, to judge by the present behaviour, and difficulty experienced in getting Japanese diplomats out of other countries, leads me however to express strong hope that the pressure will be constructive to the extent of having troops ready to march on Telman immediately if demands set forth below are not conceded. 2. General reluctance of Persian Government to co operate with us gives serious cause for concern. It ought not to be necessary for us to have to press them daily with all the force at our command in order to secure measures which would normally be taken by any Allied Government that was not fundamentally determined to re [? attach] itself [? to] the Axis. It seems better to clear the air by insisting now on all those things which we seem likely to want in the near future. 5. In the circumstances I recommend that I should see the Shah as proposed in your telegram and I should inform him that His Majesty’s Government will be obliged to send troops back to the capital immediately unless they can be assured of full co-operation by the Persian Government, whether the present Government or another, and in particular that satisfaction will be given them in regard to the following major/major^requirements namely (a) supply of rials currency according to our requirements in return for sterling at existing rate of exchange, (h) effective measures to he taken and officially announced hy the Persian Government to stop Axis propaganda, (c) removal and, if necessary, internment of prominent Persian supporters of the Axis whose names will from time to time he communicated to Persian Government. 4. As our action is going to have more general object than expulsion of Japanese legation, I think it most desirable'that similar steps Should he taken hy Soviet Government who could concentrate some troops at Kasvin. They will in fact sympathise with all above points though they may ij)t i&gt;e q/rxious themselves to press point (a). • • [Repeated to Washington No. 2465,]SECRET. SECURITY SHIRAZ - BUSHIRS ROAD.

There have been cases of shooting at labourers camps and at passing lorries, but as far as our interests are concerned the- only reported casualties from gun-shot wounds are one U.K.C.C. driver and one labourer. These shootings may be malicious, or they may be the normal desire of a man with a rifle to shoot at something. There have also been cases of robbery, usually at dusk and after dark, or hoping to relieve labourers the last few days interrogated - - road maintenance between Shiraz and Bushire and have been unable to establish that there have been wholesale desertions of labour. But alarms and rumours have on occasions kept labour away from certain areas for a day or two with consequent detriment to the work or. the road. The C.R.E. has also complained that because of the number of robbers about labourers leave their work at about 4.30 p.m. so that they can get back to their villages before dark. It will probably be some time before order has been sufficiently restored in the countryside for after dark travel off the main roads to be safe. .7 by hungry men looking for food of,their pay.

Tu f 4 . 6 ut as regards the security of the main roads in daylight no situation appears to exist with which the Persian authorities should not be able to deal. . There has been weakness in dealing with it, but the new Government, which we hope is going to be more energetic, is fully aware of the importance of making th 6 se roads safe and is a little frightened because they suspect that the Russians would be glad of a pretext to put their own troops on the road. The responsible authorities have promised to increase the number of amnieh and to insist on more energetic patrolling. It would of course be an advantage if the road between stationary posts could be patrolled by light lorries carrying L.M.Gs but the Persian Government has no motor vehicles available. Could you provide half a dozen? 5. Colonel Pybus will arrive in Shiraz on the 17th and after consultation with His Majesty f s Consul £° on to Bushire, examining security arrangements on the » and in Bushire will consult with the Consul-General and other interested officials about the further measures necessary.

From what Persian Ambassador says, the Greek Minister's information is more or less correct,'although I doubt whether the line of the new Persian Government is essentially stronger than.that of its predecessor. 2. Before M. Feroughi left office, the Persian Ambassa dor had been told to secure arrangement by which Persian troops could enter Soviet occupied territory on giving notice to the Soviet Government. The latter have not agreed to this, but have agreed in principle that troops may enter such terri tory as a result of [? common] decision by the two governments to be taken in each separate case. 3. Return of troops to Tabriz has been agreed under this arrangement but certain details still need settling. Return of troops to Rezaieh has not been agreed and Persian Ambassador has just received fresh instructions on this point. On the other hand Soviet Government have agreed that the Persian Government may maintain and arm as many gendarmes there as they think necessary. 4. As regards propaganda, the Persian Ambassador thinks the Soviet Government are sincere in saying (as M. Molotov did when he was in Moscow) that they do not countenance this. But he fears that, though they may not inspire Separatist or similar movements, their occupation forces give them their tacit benediction. 5. As regards Soviet-Polish relations 'tension' is hardly too strong, but this tension is nothing new. (INDIV).
