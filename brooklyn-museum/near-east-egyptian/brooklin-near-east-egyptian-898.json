The upper register is orange-red with black outlines. The divisions between registers are black; the lower and more complete register has a blue background with flowers in green and white, black outline. The preserved portion is in fragile condition and is apparently extremely thin. The surface has flaked considerably and apparently much of the blue background has been lost.", "medium": "Mud, pigment", "dimensions": "15 3/4 x 25 1/2 x 1 1/2 in.
