There must be an intense amount of pilfering however. Fallen fruit is the tenants right.The provision ofoff .hoot.“fr^t trwa and i 1 rtin^, cattle and the food of the latter is on the owner.Luoeme s«edand th, t of whaatand barley are also provided by the owner who takes fourrflftha of the crop from the former and nine-tenths of the crop of the t*o latter. Millet Is usually grown on the same terms as lucerne but not invariably so.Sruck and mlnotorops are sown with the tenant's seed and are his own .property. The amount in cash which a batanah Bidar receives,in the oases where no food and clothes are received is about live -ialat a month. This was the comuonest figure given in reply to questions, but an old man at Al ■‘Hj, said he got fifty Rial a year and two younger fellowe with him said they each got forty Rial.

If then the average wage for a tfatanah Bidar oe only 60 Rial a year as the other emoliments are the same ae those of the Wadi Bafflayil*,it might be supposed that 60 Rial is the value of one bunch of dates from every palm in the average holding of a &amp;amayil Bidat.

Actually all the Bat anah tenants appear to prefer to be paid as in the Banyil.so it may be presumed that the rate of pay id higher there and that the area of a uaayil holding is greater than suggested above.

Off shoots ^planted in pits in a garden of flaratih palms at oifgiak # A seeding is known as Qnsh.In the Iraq a seeding is known as 21qalahfwhile in Morocco#Algerla and Tunisia in addition to this weed#Khalt is also used. Manuring is practiced.^amel dung is the favourite application. i)r. Popence states that manuring is annual#Hiebuhr states that fish offal is used for manure. From what the preaent writer observed aftervthe goats #cows#donkeys and as( the Ureeks would say) other birds had finished with the fish#there remained very little offal.In North Africa and ’ thru the date palm zone to Persia, the dead fronds are cut off close and distally to the swollen base.In a tears time the swollen base now hard and dry is cut of close to the trunk and used for firewood# In Oman the swollen base is not cut off perl perhaps because the Shuaar and other tress provide anywhere abundant fuel.Similarly in the Punjab the bases are left on tin palm.In California also the frond bases were not cut until re centlyuSome apprension was felt when it was observed that rool were growing out of the trunks underneath the frond bases#dnd were pushing the latter off.From what appeared in the Wadio ame where roots could be found coiarionly found pushing off the front bases to a height of six feet from the ground#this root producl is not harmful to the palm,The frond abses onoe pushed off# tht aerial roots dry up and drop off. The trunk is called Garidah whan alive but when dead and cut up for the carpenter it is kk called G a rduah. In the Iraq Gadhuah is the trunk alive or dead while Jaridah is the frond midrib.Cf.the district of th* Jarid in Tunisia.The frond in the *adi 'amayil is &amp;urah pi. Lur . The vigour of the ^amayil palms is astound ing. The average height is half as high again as that of the Iraqi palms fronds twenty long are common and trunks were seen which looked three feet in diameter, though they wee* not meaeu And there are the palms which have been subjected to a nine years' draught.Many palms in the drier parts of the oases have died but not a large portion of the whole.i'ii* ihin*x*l of tUs i«mini ©cent of tii« UairX and of Uw iraa* i‘he fruit i© aoiat^hat ©j^rical and juicy, i’ll© j&gt;al?n vmi not found at Al Jill* A small date called i^atnl was aeen a© hardly ri^e Aha la 1 In -atanh i!aflcet.4f6#^7 It la eaid to be exported to India a© Analal ^eybutiu It 1© considered inferior.
