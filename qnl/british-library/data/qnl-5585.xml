I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning and spoke about both questions, reminding him that His Majesty’s Minister had pointed out that the Persian authorities application for facilities at Bombay was an additional reason for their meeting our request as regards notification of ships’ visits. Ministry of Foreign Affairs had subsequently deprecated any bargain. His Majesty’s Government were now happy to grant desired facilities unconditionally. It was however a fact that both His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were disagreeably impressed by the contrast referred to in the second paragraph of your telegram No. 32, and they definitely expected that their accommodating spirit as regards Bombay facilities would be reciprocated. I then gave the Minister for Foreign Affairs communications on both subjects and asked him to read them. Beiore doing so he expressed thanks for the Bombay agreement and on the other subject said that tbe Ministry for Foreign Affairs had been doing thei best with the Ministry of Aar. As regards cases of special urgency, they had secured concurrence in local notification only, and had cut down the notice required from forty~eight hours to thirty—six hours. 2. After His Excellency had read my communications, I drew his attention to the request that in urgent cases notification should be made through the Consular Officer at Mohammerah and the Governor of Abadan, His Majesty’s Ships giving as long notice as possible. Omission....c 2 . Omission of any reference to specified number of hours' notificalioi. was deliberate. The competent authorities held strongly that it v/ould be embarrassing in practice and unnecessary inasmuch as in these cases action would devolve on Anglo-Persian Oil Company alone and not on local Persian authorities. Minister for Foreign Affairs thought on the contrary that thirty-six hours was reasonable, and that omission of specified period would create trouble: period might be, hov/ever, further reduced to twenty-four hours. I thanked him but asked him to press the Ministry of bar in return for our accommodation over Bombay to accept the procedure suggested in my aide-memoire. He promi .od to do so and to let me know the result by Saturday. I did not refer orally or in writing to the second paragraph of your telegram No. 33 as I believe that this is agreed. 3. At the end of the friendly interview I again asked him to meet our wishes outright with a view to clearing away, while His Majesty’s Minister was in London, certain disagreeable impressions recently created in London, and India. His Excellency took this in good part.

His Majesty’s Government were reluctant to accept this regulation, because it was important that His Majesty’s Government’s ships should he able to call at Ahadan at the shortest notice/notice for refuelling and at Bushire to transport the Political Resident and his staff. 3. The Persian Government were accordingly asked to agree to the continuation of the existing system of direct notification to the port concerned. The Persian Government were only prepared to agree to this on condition that similar facilities were accorded to them in respect of the ports on the Arab coast in the Persian Gulf. H.M.G. x were not prepared to grant this. It also transpired that the Political Resident does not depend entirely for his transport on H.M.’s Government’s ships. An attempt was made to reach agreement with the Persian Government on the 'basis of simultaneous notification through the diplomatic channels and to the port concerned; with the exception of Ahadan, where direct local notification only was to he made. After lengthy discussions the Persian Government have x P.Z.5451/35 Aide Memoire handed to M.

This held out some hopes of a bargain, and it was suggested that the docking facilities should he withheld pending satisfactory settlement of the question of Ahadan.

It is also possible that if two question;* 1 were definitely linked Persian Government might give way (if they did. so at all) merely with intention of cancelling special Abadan arrangements as soon as their navy was independent of Indian dockyards. 2. For these reasons grant of docking facilities should not be made conditional on satisfactory outcome of Abadan discussions but may at your discretion be used in those discussions. You could,in particular, when informing Persian Government that docking facilities will be granted as soon as accommodation is available, make it clear that His majesty's Government have been disagreeably impressed by contrast between readiness of Persian Government to assume that Government of India will at any time grant valuable privileges at Bombay and their unwillingness to make trifling concession to His majesty’s Ships and add that as His majesty's Government are‘grant ing docking facilities they naturally expect that Persian Government will deal with Abadan question in as accommodating a spirit as po; sible. 5. Persian minister recently expressed hope of his Government that two questions would not be linked and was told that point was still under consideration, but that if His Majesty’s Government (E.561/215/34). decideddecided agairs t linking them in the sense of making them inter dependent they would certainly expect that xersian Government, whose attitude had made disagreeable impression, would adopt more friendly attitude than hitherto in what was purely matter of practical convenience# F&gt;# Ala indicated that difficulty lay '^th War Ministry. 4, Separate telegram follows regarding requirements of His Majesty's Government at Abadan# Addressed to Tehran No.£2, repeated to India for Commander-in- Chief No.10, Pushire for Senior Naval Officer No.4.* ...

At the dame time we think that Motamedy’s proposals for Abadan reported in Enatehbull Hugessen’s Telegram No.56 are h rdly an adenunte response for the facilities which they desire. e suggest, therefore, that Knatchbull Hugcssen should be instructed to continue his efforts to get an arrangement on the lines contemx&gt;lated in your Telegra* No. 13 of the 15th January using the Persian request _ for.......

As the last we heard of this suggestion was that the Persians had turned it down, we should be grateful if you could obtain confirmation that the Persians have now agreed to it.

My immediately preceding telegram* As regards the visits to Abadan for oiling, Motarne told me in confidence that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have suggested to the Ministry of War that they should agree to 43 hours previous notifica tion instead of 8 days with the same proviso as in other cases, viz. that local notification shall hold good in the absence of contrary advice from Tehran to the local Governor. This proposal has not been put to me yet, as approval of the Ministry of War is first necessary. '3. As regards repairs at Bombay, it seems probabl that if we make consent conditional on acceptance of our proposals regarding fuelling at Abadan, Ministry of War will refuse to budge. On the other hand there is as far as I know nowhere else where they can get repairs for their ships until the installation of the floating dock.

This further report on the visit of the 4 JUL. 195a Previous papers :— 2730 1000 4.34 Persian sloops to India is of some interest. On the whole the Persian officers and crews made a very good impression. They are described as well-behaved , clean and even smart , though they hardly cQjme up to British standards. In other respects, however, their efficiency is somewhat weak and they have little or no idea how to maintain and take care of machinery, guns, etc. All the guns on both vessels appear to have been in an unserviceable condition when they arrived at Bombay. The Commandant and his wife, and the Canmanders of the sloops were invited to Government House by the Governor of Bombay, and much appreciated this courtesy.1C^ The officers were enthusiastic about the work that had been done for them and apparently hope to refit their ships annually at Bombay.

You will no doubt have seen the very interesting report submitted to the Admiralty by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief regarding the visit of the 'Babr' and 'Palang” to Trincomalee, a copy of which was sent to us in last week's India Office letter. This appears to indicate that the Persian Navy at least are anxious to make amends for the flag incident at Basidu. Ghauncy’s recent despatch about the entente between the British arxl Persian Navies at Mohammerah on the 18th to 20th April also indicates that the feeling between the two services is now very cordial. 4 J.C.Walton, Esauipe.CB, ,M.C., RECO. P3L. DEPT. 5 -JUN 1934 INDIA OFFICEl,c 79 FD CONFIDENTIAL. Report hu the Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Marine, Bombay. 1. General. These vessels have a freeboard of about 10 feet. Their economical speed is about 9 knots, at which their endurance is said to be approximately 9,000 miles. They were docked, for the first time since their arrival from Italy, in the R. I. M. Dockyard at Bombay in February 1934. They are generally stiffly built, but local weakness was apparent under the 'Generators. They are likely to be very lively in a seaway. Workmanship and fittings are not of the best quality. Browns Telemotor steering gear is fitted in both vessels. There is no armour or protection of any sort. 2. Armament. Each ship has 2 102 mm Q. F. guns, and 2 Q. F. High Angle 76 mm guns, all by Ansaido. They have hydro pneumatic run out arrangements—typical Vicker’s recoil systems. The 102 mm are on pedestal mountings and have a m. v. of 750|850 m. s. Arcs—Forward gins to 140° on each side. After guns, to 40° on each side. Weight of projectile .. .. .. 13-75 Kgs. Fixed ammunition. Weight of Cartridge .. .. .. 2-95 Kgs. J Gun sighting arrangements consist of a periscopic sight on the left of the gun. Setting range on the sight angles the prism in the sighting system. Setting deflection moves the body of the sight about an axis. One man lays and trains the gun. •The H. A. 76 mm guns are of 40 cals and with a in. v. of 800 m. s. The sighting is similarly on a periscopic system. Range and deflection (lateral and vertical) are applied from R. F. reading and Tables supplied. Fuze setting is obtained from fuze curve drum inside a cover into which angle of sight is fed automatically by the elevation of the gun, and range is fed in by setting the sights. Laying and training by one man. Firing by pedal. Fire control is at the guns. The Ore control position for the main armament is on the upper bridge to .which there is communication by voice pipe. The system appears to be entirely elementary. No Director is fitted. Range Finder on the upper bridge, stereo scopic, about 2 metre base. The machine guns on the upper bridge appear to be about .5 inch. No others noted. Loading teacher and shooting teacher are both fitted. State of Armament. —Both the 102 mm guns of the “ Palang ” were opened up and found to be deeply pitted in the Recuperators, rendering them unservice able. All other guns in both vessels appear to be in the same condition. In both vessels the holding down bolts of the H. A. guns were found to be slack. Faces of breech blocks are rusted. The firing mechanism was out of adjustment and worn. The guns have been rarely fired. Ammunition. — 150 rounds per gun carried for both types of gun. All ammunition fixed, and boxes have been supplied only for a small percentage. Ammunition all of one type, presumably H. E. 3. Wireless Equipment. Ordinary Standard Marconi gear as fitted in merchant ships. Transmitting gear—Marconi type valve transmitter. Frequencies calibrated for, unknown.2 Receiving gear—Long wave, 300—5,000 metres. Short wave, frequencies unknown. The general upkeep of the installations is very good. The operators are Marconi trained men. They are Persians, trained in Italy. Call Sign of the “ Palang ”—E P A C. 4. Electrical Equipment. ^ In each ship there are 2 Diesel Generators, 30 K. W. and 1 Turbine Generator, 18 K. W., but the latter is not used. Also one emergency oil driven Generator on the main deck, 5 K. W. Each snip has a 12 circuit switchboard. Searchlight about 20'. Each ship has 2 electrically driven winches. Echo sounding gear is fitted in both ships—Echometre, Systems Florisson, made by Societe de Condensation et d’applications Mecaniques, Paris. No spares or consumable stores for electrical gear on board, and nothing apparently has been done regarding the maintenance of electrical gear. The echo sounding gear has not functioned in either ship. 5. Personnel. Officers .—Several state that they have done 4 years at the Naval Academy and 3 in Destroyers in the Italian Navy. They appear to know nothing of the routine and upkeep of gunnery material. They stated that guns fitted with hydro pneumatic recuperators were not seen in the Italian Navy, nor was the upkeep of armament of any type explained to them. The Commandant is a very pleasant little man, and speaks English fairly well. His English wife was particularly nice. They enjoyed their stay at Bombay. They play no games but are very keen on racing. The Flag Lieutenant is a particularly nice boy ; he was eight years at the Italian Naval Academy, speaks English fluently, and had most charming manners. )\ I gathered that they hope to refit their ships annually at Bombay, and were I / enthusiatic about the work that had been done for them. Officers and men are given one month’s leave a year when the former all go away to Teheran, the latter going to their coast town homes ; they can get plenty of men. Ratings .—Largely Coast Arabs. Appear to be of a low standard. A school is said to have been started at Muhammerah. It was noticeable that the ratings knew little or nothing of sight setting, etc. Non substantive gunnery badges are worn by a few ratings Shooting tea chers, which are crude and rusted up, appear to be little used. The men appear to be of a very uneducated and common type ; when in their working canvas rig they look like a lot of convicts. They are recruited for 2 f years and are all short service men. Their blue serge rig* is very badly fitting and thrown on them without any attempt at fitting. They are most punctilious about saluting and behaved particularly well and gave no (rouble whatever when living in their ships in the Yard. They conformed to all our regulations they are all Mohammedans, but nothing like as particular as (he Indians. They are five Italian Artificers in “ Babr ”, and 3 in “ Palang They joined the ships in September 1932, and state that ihey are leaving in May 1934. ENCLOSURE “ A Extract from C.

The ship appeared clean and the officers were polite. A Guard of Honour was provided but no Salute was fired. The reason given for not firing a Salute was that flags were at half-mast owing to the death of the late Dowager Queen of the Netherlands, and regula- j lions did not permit of a Salute being fired under such circumstances. iET'TER FROM THE PRINCIPAL OFFICER, MERCANTILE MARINE DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY District, Bombay, No. Sec.-3|1572, dated the 20th April 19o4.

With reference to your endorsement No. G.-IT|4-C., dated the 25th April 1934, I have i he honour to state that the following information is based chiefly on the impressions of the Principal of the Mercantile Marine and the present Chairman of the Port Trust. The ships arrived on January 24th, 1934 and were considerably behind the scheduled time. They were expected again last month, but the visit did not mature. The ships appeared to be reasonably clean and tidy. I am not able to give any information in regard to their equipment. The discipline and efficiency of the officers and men was comparatively good, though not up to the standard of our navy. On shore the behaviour of the men was good, although they were not as smart as one would expect from men accustomed to discipline. One of my informants tells me that they were anxious to create an impression of efficiency and fighting qualities. The officers were very courteous. On arrival they entertained some of the leading gentlemen who met them to tea on board. The ships were warmly wel comed by the Parsec community and a large number of Parsec ladies and gentle men were at the wharf and the Par see Boy Scouts. An * At Home ’ was given in honour of the visit by the Persian Consul at which the officers were at their ease and mingled freely with the guests.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 25 of the 17th January last, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of ah interesting despatch from Captain Chauncy, His Majesty’s vice-consul at Mohammerah. reporting that, with the cordial co-operation of the senior naval officer and of the commandant of the Persian navy, there has been a most successful exchange of courtesies between the naval units in the Persian Gulf. 2. However our general relations with the Persian Government may develop in the near future, it is all to the good that Captain Bayendor has been brought into contact, both in India and at Mohammerah, with the civilising influence of His Majesty’s navy, as the danger of inconvenient incidents is thereby reduced. 3. I have congratulated Captain Chauncy on the manner in which he has handled the affair. 4.

I HAVE the honour to report that on the 14th April the commandant of the Persian Southern Navy in H.I.M.S. Bahr, accompanied by H.I.M.S. Palang, returned to Mohammerah after their Indian tour, during which they had very friendly relations with the Royal Indian Marine in Bombay and the Commander- in-chief, East Indies, in Colombo. As the senior naval officer, Persian Gulf Division, was at Basra, I felt that a good opportunity presented itself of renewing our friendly relations with the Persian navy in the Gulf, and I forward herewith copies of correspondence^) which passed between myself and Naib Sarhang Bayendor, which led to my suggesting to the senior naval officer, Persian Gulf Division, that he might care to take this opportunity to call at Mohammerah and meet the commandant and officers of the Persian navy, particularly as he was already intending to visit Abadan. 2. Captain Creagh agreed, and the visit was arranged from the 18th April to the 20th April. I accordingly notified the Governor of Mohammerah in the usual manner of the proposed visit of H.M.S. Shoreham, and he arranged that all facilities with regard to customs and landing of officers and men should be accorded. 3. The senior naval officer, Persian Gulf, in H.M.S. Shoreham, arrived at the mouth of the Karun at 10 a.m. on the 18th and saluted the port with twenty-one guns. This was replied to by the Persian gunboat Babr. H.M.S. Shoreham then proceeded to anchor in the Shatt-el-Arab at a suitable anchorage near the Karun. The Karun itself was filled with the Persian vessels, and the only possible anchorage in front of the vice-consulate would have been unsatisfactory in view of the rapid stream after the rains. At 10T5 a.m. I made my call upon the senior naval officer, and almost simultaneously an officer from the Persian navy arrived to ask what time it would be convenient for ( l ) Not printed.

In view of the present state of Anglo-persian relations, this proposal may be considered dead, at any rate for the present, but the Government of India, in forwarding the bills (now attached) for docking the Persian sloops on their recent visit to India, refer back to the correspondenc ending with the Government of India’s demi-official letter of 27th March last (p.Z.2268/34) on the subject of the proposed concession to Persia, in which they stated (paragraph 4) that they felt that they should be paid by H.M.G. for all work done and services rendered to the Persian sloops at the rates normally charged for British warships. It is quite probable, therefore, that the Government of India expect the present bill to be met in the first instance by H.M.G. and that they consider themselves merely as agents.^' In view of this, the Department at first thought of forwarding the bill to the Admiralty, but the latter have made it quite clear in informal conversation that they regard themselves as under no obligation to refund the Government of India for docking and repairing the Persian sloops in the present case, and take the view, perhaps with some reason, that this is a purely commercial transaction between the Government of India and the Persian Government. /~ In these circumstances, it would cause unfortunate/unfortunate delay if we were to enter into a controversy v/ith the Admiralty on the subject, and much the best course seems to be to ask the Foreign Office to present the bill at Tehran to the Persian % Government for settlement. There seems no reason why the Persian Government should refuse to meet it, especially as the actual charge made (about Rs.30,000 in all) is well within the estimates submitted in India to Lieutenant-Colonel Bayendor, the Commandant of the Persian Navy. If, however, the Persians do make trouble about it, we shall have to reconsider the possibility of asking H.M.G. to refund the Government of India. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted.

From the Oommander-in-Ohief f s interesting report attached, the visit appears to have been a great success. The Persian Officers and their ships made a |£§ry good personal impression. The atmosphere was throughout friendly. The Commandant of the Squadron himself referred to the Flag incident of last summer and apologised for it, and there seems to have been a general disposition on the part of the Persians to give such undertakings as they could in regard to future friendly co-operation with H.M. ships in the Persian Gulf. While unfortunately, as the Commander-in-Chief remarks it is difficult to say how far the Commandant of the Persian Navy carries weight with the Persian authorities, the establishment of friendly personal relations ought to be of value in the future. Enclosure/Lnclosure No. 3 in the Gommander-in-Ohief’s letter records a discussion with the Persian Commandant on the conduct of Persian sloops in the Shatt-El-Arab. It is not a matter of much direct concern to m rrrri it is clear that the Persians are most unlikely to accept or conform to the Iraqi traffic regulations until the question of the river frontier is settled. Of more concern to us are the discussions (enclosure 4) about smuggling. It is satisfactory that Commander Bayendor has 'seemed thoroughly to understand that he had no jurisdiction against smugglers outside his own territorial waters” though it will not be overlooked that the Persians may claim territorial waters extending to 10 miles from the shore. Enclosure , hat a 7000 ton floating dock which a lighthouse tender with a view to the maintenance of the lights on the BahiaftT coast being taken over by maintained, will render Persia -quite independent of tto- facilities at Bombay, etc. It is probably impossible for us to prevent her taking over the lighting of her own coast though her doing so would be a breach in the unified lighting which we have for so many years maintained and will probably reduce the chances of a unified lighting control under the auspices of the Shatt-El-Arab Conservancy Board fctAav being agreed to in the future. has been ordered from Italy by the Persians^ and-that ^jCJZkndexed Any further communication should be addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W.l quoting ‘'M»Q999/&lt;54&lt; l\ z. h*- l. 291 4 s dJiiralty, S.W.l L.P.—No. 8 19 34 /9J 4 Sir, SECRET.

Be pleased to bring to Their Lordships’ notice the following report on the visit of the Persian Sloops ”Babr M and ’’Palang” to Trincomali from 13th to 16th March, 1934. 2. These two sloops left the Persian Gulf for the dual purpose of refitting at Bombay and allowing Commandant Bayendor the opportunity of returning my visit to him in the Gulf. He expected to find me in Colombo but on hearing that the Squadron was at Trincomali at once agreed to extend his cruise. On hearing that Madame Bayendor (an English woman) was with him at Bombay I asked them both to stay at Admiralty House during their visit tb Trincomali. 3. Their arrival on 13th March was almost to the minute arranged and tbe usual salutes were exchanged. 4. A programme for the visit had been prepared beforehand and was carried out, %nd in addition the Persian Commandant gave a dinner to the Commander-in-Chief and Captains of the 4th Cruiser Squadron, and the Persian Sloops gave an afternoon 'At Home” to officers and their wives and the local community. The programme as carried out is attached as Enclosure No* 1. The Shah’s birthday happened to be on Thursday, 15th March and ships were dressed and the usual salute fired at noo n. 5. I was much struck with the smartness of the Persian officers. Ihey were clean, well dressed and their mainers excellent. The ships themselves were also much smarter than might be expected, especially after having just completed a refit. They take a pride in being self-contained as regards boats, etc. 6. The Persian officers from Co :im.-.ndant Bayendor downwards fully responded to the friendly atmosphere in which they were received, and I formed the opinion that the long journey to TrincomaL i was largely undertaken with the object of trying to make amends for the behaviour of their Navy in the Flag incident last year and to do their part in re-establishing friendship between the two navies. This is confirmed by a conversation subsequently held through Staff Officer (Intelligence) Colombo, when the ships were at that place, when, on being informed that their visit iad made a very good impression, great satisfaction was expressed that their ’’mission had been achieved.” At the dinner given onboard ”Babr” Commandant Baye dor made....made a very friendly speech of which a summary is attached (Enclosure 1 made a suitable reply# 7# Commandant Bayendor and his wife stayed with me at Admiralty House throughout their visit and it soon became clear to me, through Madame Bayendor, that he wished to discuss some incident which had caused friction in the Gulf. I gave him the opportunity and when he embarked on the fELag incident reminded him that it was officially closed but that I would be very happy to discuss ii un officially, and at the same time put it to him in such a manner that he saw the whole thing from my point of view and as viewed by my officers and men# He then endeavoured to explain it away as the action of a very stupid junior officer who did not know what he was doing, buthe ended up by making his apoldgies to me and asking that I would accept them for the ishole of our Navy. I thanked him for this anc said that I was sure that we would now have no further misunderstandings. Although I regard t .is apology as a private one which cannot be quoted officially, it is, in the circumstances, a big thing for him to have done. 8. In conversation about Henjam I explained that ay instructions to the sloops in the Persian Gulf were that officers and men should be most careful to observe all the regulations laid down by the Persian authorities and avoid any friction. I felt sure that he would agree with me that they were most punctilious in carrying out these instructions. He entirely agreed. I then said that in spite of this there were constant little pinpricks either from the Deputy Governor or the Medical officer etc. We were most anxious to be friendly but a necessary condition of fttendship between two parties was that both should wish to be friends. He entirely agreed and I gather will do all in his power to prevent the recurrence of these petty annoyances. It is interesting to note that at no time did he make any reference to the arrest of the Mudir of customs. 9. Two other points discussed with Commandant Bayendor were the question of the behaviour of Persian Warships in the Shatt el Arab and that of smuggling into Persia via the Persian Gulf. A short note of iy conver sation on these points is attached (Enclosures Nos.3 A 4). 10. A short note is also attached contal ning infor mation obtained from the Italian Colonel Bezan (Construc tion Corps) who is still with the Persian ships but is shortly returning to Italy (Enclosure No. 5). No report on technical matters is being forwarded in view of the very comprehensive report recently drawn up by the Flag Officer Commanding and Director, Royal Indian^ Marine, afher the refit of these vessels at Bombay. In this connection the Persian officers expressed great satisfaction with the work carried out and the way they had been treated while at Bombay. 11. Commandant Bayendor informed me that his title i.e. ’Commandant', ranks with that of Capitaine de Corvette i.e., Lieutenant Commander, R.N. Previous to receiving this information I had instructed the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, that officers of and below the rank of Commander R.N. were to pay the first.. •..first call on Commandant Bayendor In view of his being in command of the Persian Navy. Having explained this to him I do not propose to countermand this order* It is thought that td take any other action might hasten his promotion with possible consequent difficulties in the Persian Oulf* 12* i^y personal relatione wiih Commandant Bayendor are now excellent and the visit, which has done much to bring the two naview together, may be counted as successful* It is hoped that good may come of it. 15.

Stated how much he appreciated hand of friendship held out a year ago when the Commander-in-chief visited the Gulf and Persian Navy was in its infancy. Stated how much they also appreciated great welcome given and kindness shown to them this time at TrincomdL i. Persia was now establishing a Navy. In doing so she wants to follow a policy of peace with all nations but more especially with her oldest friend England. Persia realises what England has done in the past in the Gulf in the way of establishing a regime of security and peace on the seas and appreciates that this has been done in the interest# of all as well as England’s own interests. Persia intends that the efforts of her Navy in the Gulf shall be directed towards the same ends and hopes that they may co-operate with us in everything.SECRE T. Enclosure No. 3 in East Indies 1 Letter NO.270/B.I.3273C dated 2Gth March, 1934. SHATT EL ARAB: CONDUCT OP PERSIAN SLOOPS. The question of the conduct of the Persian Sloops in the Shatt el Arab was discussed with Commandant Bayendor. He informed me that at the bottom of the difficulties which had arisen was the question of the frontier of iersia* and stated that Iraq held that this frontier was on the Persian shore of the river and that the whole river belonged to Iraq further that Persia held that the frontier should be the middle line of the river. (It appeared as if he thought that I might be quite ignorant of the history of the question and that he might thereby get an Opinion from me that the middle line was the natural frontier). I replied that I was not an expert on treaties but I understood that tie matter was regulated by an old pre-war treaty between Persia and Turkey by which Persia accepted the frontier on the Persian side of the river. On seeing that I was aware of the Treaty he adaitted its existence but said that it was obviously out of date. I then asked whether Commandant Bayendor took any exception to the traffic regulations themselves and he said that he did not and that thej, were very good regulations but that it was impossible for Persia to accept them until the question of the frontier was settled - because they would not recognise the power of the Port of Basra authorities to issue regulations for V the river. I then appealed to him as a practical seaman to look at the matter from the practical point of view of those who had to use the river every day rather than from the theoretical point of view, which clearly in any case had to be dealt with by the political authorities. I asked him whether it was not possible for those Persians who had to use the river to arrive at a practical 'modus vivendi” with Iraq leaving the question of principle in connection with the frontier aside for the time - each party maintaining their views intact. I instanced other cases of deputes on a matter of principle where, pending the settlement on the question of principle , the people on the spot had to arrive at a practical agreement as to the carrying on of day to day affairs • Commandant Bayeador finally stated that though he had no fault to find with the Shatt el Arab rules, he had not the authority to ^instruct his ships to obey them. On the other hand he could assure me that the one idea of his ships was to avoid a collision or similar incident and that they would always get out of the ifray of any ship which was obeying the rules - his shipsships were sraall and handy and could always te ep out of the w&amp;y» and he did not want them sunk* I was left with the impression that while the Persian Navy will not at present recognise the rules issued hy Port of Basra Authority, they will in practice obey them in iuture. The proposed 3hatt el Arab Conservancy Board was not mentioned hy either side but I think it is possible that _ Commandant Bayendor wsuld ajcept the setting up of this Boaid with a Persian representative (and thereby accept the regulations) without insisting on the previous settlement of the frontier Question, but how far Commandant Bayendor carries weight with the Persian authorities I am undble to say. ■■s.ii-S . 8 , J !■ Enclosure No#5 tn East Indies* letter No. 270/E*I.3273C dated 26th ilarch, 1934* INFORIviACT OH OBTAIN E D EROM COLONEL BEZAK. 1.

Yours .luourj^ by Am m«1- J.G. 1 -r' /WV/JA A ^March 1934 Repairs to Persian sloops. Please refer to the correspondence ending with the telegram from His Majesty’s Secretary of State No.346, dated the 7th February 1934, regarding the refitting of Persian sloops in the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard, Bombay. Grieve of the 13th January 1934, viz., (a) payment of a fixed sum for clocking, (b) waiving of overhead charges, and (c) waiving of dock dues. the Persian Government sloops and those of the Royal Navy. In the latter case the exact requirements should usually be known beforehand, while from the experience gained from their recent visit, we gather that, unless tied down absolutely to every detail the Persians will go on asking for additional work to be done to their sloops all the while they are in the yard. The present refit was not based on Admiralty Regulations and 75 per cent of the work carried out was in the nature of alterations. It would as a result be quite impossible for the Government of India to accept the arrangement proposed by the Admiralty that they should be paid a fixed sum for either the dry docking or refit of the Persian sloops in the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard. On the contrary, they feel justified in asking for payment for all work done at the normal charges levied in the case of Royal Navy vessels. (b)... 2. There are three main points raised in Seal’s letter to 3. As regards (a) it is difficult to draw an analogy betweenWaiving of overhead ch arges. The assumption of the Admiralty that it is not proposed to recover these charges from the Persian Navy is not correct. Foreign Governments are required to pay the same rates of overhead charges as are levied in the case of the Admiralty* viz., 40 per cent, on labour and lb per cent on materials, and the Government oi India see no reason why they should accord any preferential treatment to the Persian Government in this respect. They would, however, have no objection to these charges being included in the total amount to be recovered instead of being shown separately. I may point out in this connection, that the above official rates are much lower than the theoretical overhead charges* which come to about 59 per cent on labour and 26 per cent on materials. V/e should have no objection to the Admiralty making capital out of the fact that the difference between the theoretical and official rates has been waived. (c) Waiv ing of do ck dues . I hardly think the comparison which the Admiralty draw between their treatment of foreign ships and the regular refit of Persian vessels in Indian yards is correct. As we understand the position, Foreign Government only occasionally send their vessels to Admiralty Yards for refits and docking, e.g., when a man-of-war meets with an accident or is on a world tour and requires docking. On such occasions the Admiralty, as an act of international courtesy, waive dock dues, eyprcting that the foreign Governments would do.do the same in the case of vessels of the Royal ITavy. The case of the Persian sloops is entirely different, in that Persia has no docks of her own and will for some time require half- yearly docking and annual refitting. The Government of India accordingly still do not see on what grounds they can he expected to depart from the views communicated in Fraser-Tytler’s demi-official telegram lTo.2047, dated the 19th August 1933. They would, however, have no objection to the adoption of the procedure suggested in the case of overhead charges in this instance also, i.e., the sum on this account not being shown separately. 4. To put the matter rather bluntly, the Government of India feel that they should be paid b y His Hajesty»3 Government for all work done and all services rendered to the Persian sloops at the rates normally charged for vessels of the Royal l T avy. The method of showing the various charges in the bill to ce presented to tne Persian Government and any concessions to be made to that Govern ment are not in their opinion matters with which they are concerned 5. We have not yet received the bill for the work recently carried out in the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard on the 'Palang' and the ”Babr H , but it will be forwarded to the India Office as soon as we get it.

(a) ’’PALANG” and M BABR” left Mohammerah on 14th January, visited Bushire from 15to 16th January and arrived Bombay 29th January. Major Bayendor (Commandant of the Persian Navy) and Yawar Amin (Chief Accountant, Persian Navy) are accommodated in these ships for their cruise which is to last about three months and has three objects:- (i) To ’’show the flag” at ports from Karachi to Colombo; (ii) To return the 1932 visit of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies at Colombo; (iii) To dock both ships. The necessary arrangements appear to have been made by the Persian Consul General at Delhi with the Government of India direct, but were not communicated either to Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf or Gulf Authorities* The ships sailed without any International Code of Signals and only borrowed Tide Time Tables at the last moment from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Abadan. They had hoped to get the necessary books at Karachi, but no report has been received that they called there. It was also reported that they intended visiting Henjam from 18th to 20th January but they did not do so.

W. 1 . 18th January, 1934.. / y l My dear Laithwaite, I enclose herewith a copy of a letter to v Grieve dealing with the financial arrangements for the refitting of Persian sloops at Bombay. Although it looks at first sight as if the Government of India are providing the lion’s share of the financial concession, the principle which we imagine lies behind Praser-Tytler’s telegram No.2047 is that the Government of India would be content if they were reimbursed for every item of actual direct expenditure incurred in connection with the refits, and it is only the overhead costs (most of which would be incurred whether or not the refit goes on) which they have agreed to waive. I have just seen a copy of an India Office letter to the Admiralty, P.404/34, dated 15th January, 1934, tt*. (if?*-** j I the wording of which suggests to my mind that the rate of overhead charges (40$ on labour and 15$ on materials) may not be applicable to a Poreign Government. Gould you find out if there are other and higher rates for this purpose? If so, it would be possible to construct a propaganda statement which would make the offer appear even more favourable from the Persian point of view. With regard to the dock dues, you will see from my letter to Grieve that the Admiralty practice is always to waive these for a Poreign Government as a matter of international courtesy. We think that if the Government of India knew that this was our practice they would probably be prepared to follow suit, especially as dock dues are not direct expenditure, but must be regarded as in the nature of ENCLOSURE IN W /overhead NO. 4 25 JAM. 1934 j FROM SECRETARY, POL SECRET DEPT.

Perhaps you will take an early opportunity of consulting the Government of India on this point. The tabular financial statement in paragraph 5 of my letter to Grieve is very approximate, and is based upon our own (Admiralty) experiences of refits at Bombay. It would probably be advisable to supply Hoare as soon as possible with a similar statement based upon the actual expenses incurred by the Persian sloops in their forthcoming refit at Bombay, as this would make a more direct appeal to the Shah.

If you look on page 2 of the enoloeure. ,ou iriU ... tae amendment, we proposed in connection with the possibility of offering facilities at Bombay for the repair of Persian aioops, which were substantially accepted by the foreign Office and eommunicatod to Tehran. The foreign Office bare now indicated that in their vie* if Hoare i. to achieve anything on these lines it i. noco.sary to b. more prooleo as to the extent of the financial oonoeesion to be made, and we have, therefore, been looking into the matter somewhat more fully, ■me two larger Persian sloops are actually visiting Bombay this month for a rofit. which makes an offer of epeolal facllitioe particularly apposite at the moment. 2. in Treasury letter S.346T2 dated lath December. 1929. sanction was given for the payment of a rent for Henjam not exceeding £ 1.000 .a year, which was to bs borne in o W al ****** tilB iBip0rial Government and the Government of India. 3. On the basis of demi-official telegram Ho. 204? from Fraser-Tytler to lalthwaite (of which a copy le enclosed • co-denieiwe of reference) the two larger Persian snips would cost m the region of £337 for docking, cleaning, painting and repairing under-water fittings (apart from dock lue. which are dealt with below). if, therefore, an arrangement w.r. mad. for the admiralty to pay th. Gov.mmont of India a fixed sum, calculated on this basis, every time Uia dock one of the larger Persian vessels, up to a maximum *• k. Grieve, O.B.E., M,U.

As regards dock dues, you will see from Fraser ?ytler # a telegram that the Government of India expect to fee reimbursed for this item. It is our invariable praotioe to waive these duos when a foreign warship is docked, and wo hope, therefor®, that the Government of India will agree to follow our practice in this matter, especially ae the dues do not represent out-of-pocket expend!tare. If, however, they do not agree to this course, we should propoee that the lump sum to fee paid to the Government of India for eaoh docking should take into account this item in addition to the actual expenditure* The amount is vory small - in the region of £37 por docking. 6 . Fraser '£ytler , s telegram enclosed Is not very clearly worded, but *fe take it to mean that the Governfnent of India would fee prepared to undertake the work on the basis of charging actual direct oosts only, which would ensure that they were not actually out of pocket. On this assumption and if Treasury sanation is given to the above suggestion, we are able to draw up the following statement, which Ho are could be use for propaganda purposes in Tehran*- ^ Admiralty to pay for docking, cleaning, etc. 337 Persians to pay actual cost of labour plus material, say 4,600 Indian Government to waive overhead charges plus do JU537 Total ,.. £6.1743. on these figures, Hoars would be able to say that the Persian Government would get a refit ooeting about £6,500 under oommeroial conditions for £4,600, i*e* at a reduction of about 3Q;*. 6. the figures fcr the coat of a refit are naturally very rough, but they are based upon the chiirges Bombay have made in the past for refitting our sloops, and include £3,000 for labour plus £1,600 for material. The overhead chargee are reckoned at 40$ on labour and 15; on material, which are the rates applicable to us * higher rates may be applicable to lereia, which would make the picture even rnorv* attractive to Persia* T. I understand from the foreign Office that they arj anxious to get off instructions to Hoare as soon as possible, in order not to miss any opportunity for negotiation* If, therefore, you could indicate semi-officially that the Treasury would be prepared to sanction an arrangement on the above linea, instructions could be sent off at onoe, and the arrangement could be formally ratified by an exchange of official letters subsequently* 8, I am sending copies of this letter to kaithwaite and earner, and enclose a covering letter I have sent to the former* Yours sincerely.

It would not do at all to produce anything here which might provoke press articles or even questions in House of Commons which would revive the whole discussion; if that happened there would be more .. 0 S'more talk here and so on and v/e should never get on v/ith the to.sk which we had in hand (this was the general sense of my above -mentioned despatch) n The Shah quite saw this and said that if I could write desired note he thought all that would he necessary would he a simple statement in Parliament that incident was closed, I said I would report this to you. Something on the lines of my immediately preceding telegram would 5 I think, meet the case. The Shah, had rapidly become extremely friendly and talked about his desire for the best relations between naval officers, I replied that there was a good deal of misunderstanding and that I thought it would be an excellent thing if he would instruct Major Bayendor to pay an informal call on Political Resident and have a frank and friendly discussion. The Shah said he had decided to go further then this and send his Worsnips to call at Indian ports but none the less would instruct Bayendor as suggested by me. With a veiled reference uo flag incident he said as regards naval matters he hoped that I would not consult Legation files (indicating with a gesture a gree.t heap of papers)*. I assured him tnac when it seemed v/iser I had an extremely bad memory. As instance of his desire for friendly relations he mentioned order for commercial vessels which would almost certainly go to England and other orders would follow but these relations must be based on friendly feelings and it must not be imagined that Persia needed British friendship.At close of audience I told the Shah plainly that we ® could not hope that incident would never recur hut if anything was troubling him I hoped he would send for me at once 0 It is only yesterday that Minister for Foreign Affairs told me definitely that the Shah did not wish to talk politics with me nor to receive Military Attach^ on this occasion and a day or two ago I learned he hah reconsidered his intention to send warships to India,, As a matter of fact he talked politics far more reasonably than on previous occasions with me or, judging from records, with my predecessor and as regards Military Attach^ on my arrival his Private Secretary seemed horrified to find that Military Attach6 was not with me and I hah to send for him post haste. I cannot pretend to say whether the Shah, plays sardonic comedy with his Ministers or whether he genuinely changes his mind.
