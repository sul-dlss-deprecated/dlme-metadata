Medical arrangements at Bunder Abbas. Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 2688, dated the 1st November i.93 9, ana to sa^ that, as a result of the war, it has been found necessary for the Consul, Kerman, to remain indefinitely at Bunder Abbas as Naval Ropoiting Officer. The recommendation originally made by the Govemmpnt of India in the External Affairs Department letter No. F.8(35)“E/39, dated the 4th September 1939, for the appointment of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Bunder Abbas was meant to meet peace tr^me reremen j the possibility of the Consul, Kerman, being required to remain at Bunder Abbas with an increased staff for a considerable period as Naval Reporting Officer was not provided for. In addition to render ing medical aid to the Consul and his staff, the Medical Oj.xicer at Bunder Abbas will be required to attend to the duties of Naval Report ing Officer during occasional periods, when the Consul Kerman is unavoidably absent from Bunder Abbas in connectioi* wivh Lis ooi.si.lar duties. There is at present no responsible officer available at Bunder Abbas for this purpose and it is, therefore, necessary that the Medica}. Officer should bw of sufficient seniority to be entrusted with the duties of Naval Reporting Officer. 2. In view of the circumstances stated above, His Majesty’s Consul Bunder Abbas is strongly of the view and the Government of India are constrained to agree that it is necessary to provide a( X ; m 4,3 3L O - 2 - Medical Officer of more senior rank than a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, and it is therefore proposed to appoint a Military Assistant Surgeon &amp;1 Bunder Abbas for the duration of the war* 3* In view of the urgency for arranging for medical aid at Bunder Abbas, action is being taken, in anticipation of approval of the proposals in paragraph 2 above, to depute 4th Class Military Assistant Surgeon E.J.Frederick to Bunder Abbas on the terms specified below:- Pay of rank (in Civil employ) i*e* Rs. 200/^- p*m* Special Pay* ••• ••• Rs * P* r;; * Free quarters or a house rent allowance of*** ••• &lt;**• P** It will thus be seen that practically no extra expense is involved by the proposals made above* 4 . it is requested that, if there is no objection, the sanction of His Majesty's Government may kindly be obtained to the proposed modification of the arrangements already approved by them. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, for Secretary of India*# India Office, London, 24th January 1939. Financial, No. 1. To His Excellency the Host Honourable the Governor General of India. My Lord Marquess, Counci 1 before I have considered the Despatch of Your Excellency's Government, No.2 (Finance) dated 3rd November 1938, regarding the nature and extent of the limitations to be imposed on the financial powers of the Governor-General in Council while Part XIII — Government of India Act, 1935, is in operation. The proposals in that Despatch proceeded by reference to tne terms of my Despatch No.6, dated the 25th March 1937, to the Governor of Burma„ but I think that it may be convenient that the present reply thereto should be self-contained. Proposed limitation of the financial powers of the Governor-General in during the transitional period Feder; tion. f. 10191/38. of the 2. The limitations with v.-hich we are now concerned are such as might be imposed solely in the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers under Section 314 of the ^ct, and nothing in the present Despatch must be taken as having any reference to any limitation imposed, or that may hereafter be imposed, by or under other provisions of the Act, such as Sections 235 and 247. It will, moreover, be understood that nothing in this Despatch affects the arrangements for submission to the Secretary of State of the Budget proposals, in regard to which the existing requirements will remain in force. Your excellency will also appreciate that the directions now given must remain Open to reconsideration in the light of experience. 3. I have decided, in accordance with the recommendations of Your Excellency's Government, and in supersession of the directions communicated in my Financial Despatch No.13, dated the 8th April 1937, that my previous consent shall be sought upon the following matters to the extent indicated against each:- (i) Expenditure in respect of the Governor-General's staff and household, the residences, furniture and motor cars provided for his use, his equipment and travelling allowances, his sumptuary allowance, and his contract allowance, shall be regulated by such requirements as have been or may be made in this regard by the Secretary cf State. (ii) Expenditure in r^-sp^ct of Diplomatic and Consular Services in Iran and the Persian Gulf shall be subject to the previous sanction of the Secretary State except in the following cases:- (a) fresh expenditure on salaries up to an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate at any one Consulate:(b) increased expenditure on contingencies, except as regards an unusual item exc^o-ding £100; (c) increased expenditure on travelling. _ The previous sanction of the Secretary of State shstll also be sought to any addition to the total annual limit of expenditure fixed by him for ofiicc allowances and ot.xr contract grants for all Agencies and Consulates in Iran end the Persian Gulf whore such expenditure is divisible between His Majesty T s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, except temporary excesses in the permissible aggregate limit not exceeding Rs.250. (iii) Expenditure on the purchase of imported military stores shall be subject to suen rules as have been or may be made in this regard by the Secretary of State, and no purchases not covered by such rules shall be made without his prior consent. (iv) The consent of the Secretary of State shall be obtained before any dispute arising out of the terms of a contract executed in England with a Railway Company of English domicile is referred to arbitration. 4. Apart from these specific limitations, the question whether a prior reference should be made to the Secretary of State will in future depend upon the judgment of Your Excellency's Government. As Your Excellency is well aware, a similar discretion is already exercisable over the whole range of Government activity except in so far as reference to me has been specifically required by the rules hitherto in force on the subject of prior sanction to expenditure, and the conventions governing its exercise are familiar. In broad terms, prior reference to the Secretary of State will be required either if the nature of the proposed action, or the circumstances in which it is to be taken are such as to occasion doubt whether the Secretary of State 1 may not find reason to question its suitability; cr_ (even in cases where no such doubt is felt) if warranted by the intrinsic importance or general interest of the matter or by the degree of criticism which is likely to be aroused in Parliament, in the Indian Legislatures, or elsewhere. These criteria should in future be applied over the whole financial field. I do not propose to attempt to suggest in any detail how r they should be applied, though I would particularly instance, as an example of the occasions upon which doubt might arise, the case of an important unresolved difference of opinion between the Finance Department and another Department. I prefer in general to rely on the discretion of Your Excellency’s Government, confident that it will always be exercised with a full sense of the ultimate responsibility to Parliament which the Secretary of State must continue to bear for all the operations of Your Excellency's Government.

At present there are, for all practical purposes, no medical facilities at Bandar ^ibbas for the Consul arid his staff. 3. The post of Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Bandar J^bas was : f : ^ created in 1930, vine Government of India, Forei^/i ana i /U1^4 (xrh+ tL (s&amp;jnf Political Department, Lemorandum No. F. 237-N/25, dated the 26th November, 1930. Subsequently, owing to financial stringency, thie Government of India found themselves 'reluctantly compelled' to consider a change of policy in regard to the medical arrangements in Persia and the Gulf, r ^ana in their Express Letter No. F-152( 104)-S/31, dated ^October 1931, proposed the abolition of the post. The Political Resident at the time agreed to the abolition of the post so long as the Consular posts at Kerman ana Bandar- Abbas remained combined* In this connection a reference is invited to this Residency's telegram Ho. T-72, dated the 25th? 24th October. 1931. TPie Vice-Consul at Banaax Abbas (holding additional charge of Kerman) was, at the time, a qualified Assistant Surgeon, ana there seei^s to be no doubt that this point was taken into consideration and influenced the ^.TZ-Political- 2 - Political Resident in agreeing to the abolition of the post* 4. Th* position has been altered since the retirement of i^ajor (.assistant Surgeon) Lincoln ano the appointr^ent of K hajor Falconer to the post of Consul, Rerman-Bandar Abbas,. likely that a Consul with medical oualifications will ever be posted to Banaar Abbas. 5. The possibility of util is ins’ the services of the local Iranian doctor must, in my opinion, be ruled out on the grounos of (1) hie lack of adequate professional qualifications and training and (2) his complete indifference to his obligations. The Iranian military doctor at Bandar .sbbas is probably better ojialified in his profession, but he is debarred from serving the Consulate. 6. It is therefore essential to consider the provision of suitaole medical facilities for the Consul when in residence at bandar Abbas ana for the staf iL ermanently stationed there. The only satisfactory solution to the difficulty is to revive the post of Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Bandar Abbas. 8. The expenditure involved in the proposal can be met from the existing sanctioned grants of the Banaar ^bbas Yice- Consuiate by effecting the changes outlined below:- (a) Elimination of the 'Escort' and 'Launch” establishments as separate units ann formation of one menial establishment to be pain from the Office Allowance Grant. The 'Escort”, as such, has Ion- since ceased to exist* ana there is no point in retaining a title which is a with effect from 1st November, 1937, and it seems most un g&gt;,*u5w *&lt;.u ’■ Surgeon of the rank of Senior Jemadar or Junior Subeaar may misnomer.The proposed strength of the iiieniai establishment to be paia from the Office xillowance grant is shown in the attached Statement ’h f . It represents a reduction of five UUUG XU-Ci CU. C^UC^UCL L/C JL U 1 CAXfc)L/XXi^ I C gU Xi eiXlCIl 0 b 5 a L/ CLIiy labej so long as Bandar hbbas remains an a^^enaage of Lerman. (b) Destruction of Escort horse ana the substitution of purchased in 1935 for Rs. 1,000/-. In present conditions it is unlikely that'anything; approaching the purchase price v/ill be realised on re-sale, but the best possible price will be obtained. the provision of adequate medical facilities is more important than the retention of this craft. It is suggested that a portion of the sale proceeds of the boat should be utilised to purcnase two pedal bicycles referred to in paragraph 6(b) above, ana the balance credited to Government. (a) .abolition of the present post of compounder ^aia from the Of lice allowance ,~xant~ 9. The financial effect of the above proposals is shown in the accompanying; Statement 'S*. Hie figures shown unuer 'present fixed grants' are those sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India. 10. I trust that the above proposals, which do not involve any additional expenditure over the grants as fj^xed by the Secretary of State, will meet with the approval of His Hajesty*s Government ana the Government of India ana that early oraers will be issued so as to enable a Sub-Assistant Surgeon to be appointed at Bandar Abbas as soon as possible. two oedal bicycles for messenger service .

For reasons given by Captain Ohaunoy I consider that an increase in he remuneration of Dr. D’Souza Is justifiable and accordingly request that the Government of India be ple&amp;sed to fix his allowance at 100/- per men sem.Copy of a letter Ho.540, dfe ted JUne 7, 1935&gt; from His l^Jeaty * a Vice-Consul, Mohauuuerah, to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1 have the honour to forward a copy of an aj^pliot tion of Dr. l^Souza, addressed to me whiah|is self explanatory* W persOial views are that the renunera tion of Ks 50/- to Dr. D*Souza as Medical Officer to this Vice-Consulate is insufficient, particularly in view of the fact that he is not now allowed by the Iranian regulations to have Ms own dispensary or to dispense his own medicines, the cost of the medicines he supplies and these are limited to ordinary medicines only, is considerable, and Ido not consider Ps« 50/- is sufficient compensation for both medicines and services* 'The retention of aozam doctor's services is absolutely necessary and as Dr. D'Souza has given entire satisfaction I recommend that his remuneration be increased to R»* 10o/- per mensem* For your information I should add that Dr. D*souza has to look after the health of 60 persons, which includes the staff of this Consulate (superior and menial) and their families.Uhder the oircrirastAncea I find it impossible to cerry on the old remuneration and unless it is increased to at least P.s* 100/- per mensem I do not think it is worth anjr while to officiate as one at the cost of my private income to say nothing of my services* ^waiting an e^rly and just consideration*(Copy) Prora-The Additional Deputy Secretary Government of India in the Porel Political Department, To - The Hon’hie the Political Resident-, Persian Gulf.

HEALTH. A particularly virulent outbreak of influenza has ^occurred at Sistan. The town and all surrounding villages are affected. Many deaths are occurring daily from Pneumonia. One member of the Clerical staff of this Consulate and four menials have died, and fully half the entire staff are at present sick several dangerously so. His Majesty!s Consul and the Vice-Consul suffered from mild attacks. Malaria which has not previously existed in Sistan became prevalent last summer and it is anticipated that it will increase next year. The town has large pits of stagnant water in which mosquitos breed. Hitherto mosquitos have been dispersed by the annual ^ad-o-Bist 1 wind. This wind was abnormally light during the summer. As a high percentage of the population has become infected it is feared that mosquitos will spread the disease in the spring. The sanitary department has ceased tp operate. The Municipal Doctor has been dismissed and arrangements are now in the hands of the new Governor, who appears to dissipate his energies solely in grandiose schemes for disfiguring the towia, and pays no attention to urgent matters of public health.Bo* 1580 Of 1931* r His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate, Sistan and Kain, Bated Sistan (Bast Persia) the 14th Hovember 1931* my telegram 1552, dated the 10th Hovember 1931 and to state as under *•« 2* In my letter Bo* 1488, dated the 22nd October 1931, I submitted a proposition statement for reduction of expenditure on Medical arrangements in Sistan Consulate Area and in respect of the Birjand Vice-Consulate.

Since these proposals were submitted it has transpired that the Missionary Doctor^ has closed Medical work at Zahidan and under these circumstances, the retention of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon is unavoidable.
