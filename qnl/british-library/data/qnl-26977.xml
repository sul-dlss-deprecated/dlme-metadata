This practice serves as/ X$fas the most convenient foim of reminder to prevent the matter from being overlooked through lapse of time. Other means such as those suggested in your note can however be adopted for this purpose, and if as appears to be the case, there is objection in India to the practice in relation to the Persian debt, no objection need be raised to its discontinuance in this instance.

You will see from the Secretary of State's telegram No. 3457, dated the. 17th December 1924, and this ^ &lt;/**✓&lt;* Department letter No. 1973-A, dated the 25th February 1925 &gt; that the amount of debt was written off to Indian revenues without prejudice however to recovery from the Iranian Government. No progress has so far been made for the settlement of the loan as the treaty negotiations are in abeyance. When circumstances are propitious, the matter will doubtless be pressed.

Telegram sent today Am writing off to Section M Extraordinary payments non voted in Account last financial year Loans 2367270 Military Commission 3481 Amended reprint follows Toy post.I agree generally with Hood’s note below, 7' subject to Clauson's marginal conxnents. I agree to the para, which you propose to insert in the Reoort for 1934-35. ^ » The debt was reduced to £2,000,000 by an &lt;s agreement in 1926, but this was never ratified by the Persians. In spite of the non-ratification of this agreement, we have as a fact in subsequent negotiations taken £2,000,000 as the amount of the outstanding debt. Thus,in January 1930 we informed the Persians in writing that we were prepared to reduce the total debt from £2,000,000 to £1,000,000 as part of a general treaty settlement. Nevertheless, I agree that it is (theoretically at any rate) correct to take the debt at its original figure. The subsequent discussions referred to, and the general treaty negotiations of which they were part, came to nothing, though we hinted orally at a further reduction (below £1,000,000). The prewar debt of £490,000,^as you know, I think^) has-been paid off by the Persians. 7K SA ' if ~ x. — ^ ^3&lt;^ Article XII — Debt. The treaty article has yet to be drafted. The salient points are the following :— 1. In 1926 Feroughi, then Prime Minister, agreed in writing on the sum of £2,000,000 as that part of Persia’s total debt to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India (amounting, in fact, to well over £5,000,000) which she could properly be called upon to pay. Included in the 2 million was the pre-war debt of £490,000, on which Persia had always paid interest, and which she finally repaid in June 1933. 2. This agreement was, however, subject to ratification, and the Persian Government made no attempt to obtain Majlis approval. Teymourtache always maintained that the sums advanced to Persia during and immediately after the war were spent in British rather than Persian interests, and should be regarded as British war expenditure. There is, it must be admitted, a good deal to be said for this view, and in practice there is no likelihood whatever of the Persians ever consenting to repay any part of this debt. 3. In January 1930 the Persians were informed in writing that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to reduce the total debt from two to one million pounds as part of a satisfactory general settlement (“. . . . con cessions .... que mon Gouvernement est pret a octroyer dans le but de realiser un accord d^finitif ”—see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 80 of the 22nd February, 1930). 4. In April 1930 Teymourtache “ expressed great disappointment at the offer to renounce only one million. He had counted on our renouncing the whole two million of the debt, besides providing ships and abandoning claims.” After further discussion, he was informed orally by Sir R. Clive that, “ if the Persian Government were prepared to pay a reasonable sum in settlement . . . .” (i.e., of British claims) . His Majesty’s Government might be willing to forgo a further amount of debt, excluding always the £490,000 of pre-war debt ” (Tehran telegram No. 26 of the 2nd April, 1930). [Note.—It is probable that when pressing, on this occasion, for the remission of “ the whole two million,” Teymourtache had overlooked that the pre-war debt was included in this sum.] The proposal was never further pursued. 5. Hitherto instructions to His Majesty’s Minister have been that His Majesty’s Government should not be committed as regards the remainder of the war and post-war debt. It has, however, long been realised by His Majesty’s Government that before a satisfactory treaty settlement can be obtained this remaining £510,000 will almost certainly have’to be remitted, and it has now been decided^to give His Majesty’s Minister full discretion to make the offer of its remission at the moment which he considers most suitable and without prior reference to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom or the Government of India. ! kt ^ ('Z.

Many thanks for your letter of the 5th October, No.E.5913/1329/34, enclosing the provisional draft of the general treaty instructions to be given to Hoare. Broadly speaking, the draft seems to us to be excellent, and subject to the points dealt with below, and to any comment which the Government of India may have to moke on the Du&amp;dap Railway (as to which Walton is writing to you separately) and on the terms of the Preamble, and Articles I and III bis, we do not think that the Secretary of State is likely to see any objection to it. As regards consultation with the Government of India we appreciate your anxiety for an immediate decision; and it is, of course, the case, that save on a very few points the draft treaty in the stage which it has now- reached is essentially based on consultation with them and has their concurrence. But while generally speaking we/ Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l.1 2 . we should feel able to recommend acceptance of the draft (with the modifications suggested below) without further reference to them, we think it desirable to give them an opportunity to comment. We have therefore sent them a copy of your draft by this week*s air mail, under the letter of which I enclose a copy and will follow it up with a telegram with a view to reducing delay to a minimum. 2. I deal firstly with the draft despatch, in which we would recommend concurrence subject to the following comments. Para.5. We understand that in referring to possible difficulties in connection with the issue of the Exequatur, you have in mind the risk that the Persians might refuse their Exequatur to our Consul- G-eneral at Bushire without giving any specific reason, (which under international practice they isay not be required to give) but in fact on the ground, as they would probably admit in unofficial discussions, that he also held what amounted to an administrative post (as Resident). Walton's letter of the 14th September, P.Z.5469/33, suggested that a treaty article providing for the retention of the Residency at Bushire might be dispensed/dispensed with, provided that it is clear ’’that the Persians could not object to our having a Consul- General at Bushire merely because he held another capacity ” and stated that the India Office would desire to be very sure that the right of consular establishment is sufficient to ensure continuance of present arrangements at Bushire. In view of the risk to which the Foreign Office draw attention we have thought it best to consult the .Government of India. I enclose copy of a telegram which has been sent to them. If the Government of India should consider that the risk is too serious to take we may have to make some other suggestions (possibly to aim at an exchange of notes regarding the subject). Meanwhile we suggest the omission of the last four lines of this paragraph of the draft despatch, and the addition of the words:’’But I may have to telegraph further instructions on this subject after the Government of India’s views have been obtained. 4. Para.6. I am writing separately to Lascelles about the Foreign Office redraft of the Preamble and Article I. Yfe are provisionally disposed to suggest that in the Preamble the word M -l’Inde” should be substituted for the words n les Indes”, and that the words// ' 4. words ”ou suzerainet? TT should be omitted in the last paragraph of Article I* These, however, are relatively minor points, 5, I may perhaps put on record (in connection with our recent discussion about Kuweit) that the risK that the terms of Article I and the Notes to be attached thereto might preclude us from establishing a protectorate over one of the States named should we later desire to do so, was discussed in 1930 in connection with various drafts then under consideration, all of which involved an undertaking by both parties ’'respecter l 1 integrity territorial© et 1 1 independence de 1‘autre H.P.C.', ana which covered the Gulf States (cp: Foreign Office letter of 17th April 1930, E.1896/143/34; Walton's letter to you of 12th December, 1930 No,P.Z.6916/30; and Warner's letter of 29th December, 1930 E.6762/143/34} A ihe x-oieign 0j.xi.ee appear to have been satisfied that no risk was involved, and we assume that they remain of imis opinion. The point was also discussed in connection with Article VTI of the draft Treaty in Foreign Office letter E.2632/1453/34 of 15th June 1932, 6 * Para,7, As you know, we have referred Article III bis to the Government of India. , Para, 10, We have always regarded it as essential to/to secure a formal recognition in the Treaty of the status of Tamb, and of Abu Musa, in the terms of the present draft Article VIII. If the Persians wish to couple their recognition of the Jov/asimi ownership of Tamb with a lease of the Island on the Sheikh's conditions we should see no objection , so long as the Sheikh’s conditions were met, and the point about the lighthouse to which reference is made in Lascelles’ memorandum was covered. But we are not anxious to encourage them to do so and the draft as it stands tends to go farther than we should like. We should therefore like to propose the following redraft:- 'The position as regards Article VIII, Tamb, Abut Musa and Sirri, is still as described in the relevant part of the Memorandum. Formal recognition by Persia in the Treaty of the Jowasimi ownership of iam P an &lt;t Abu Musa is one of the ^-essential desiderata of His Majesty’s Government. If, however, the Persian Government should desire to revive the question of leasing Tamb, subsequent to their recognition of its status, from the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, His Majesty’s Government while not anxious to encourage the Persian Government to adopt this course, would in such circumstances see no objection to it, subject to acceptance by the Persian Government of the conditions laid down bym 6 , the Sheikh and to a special provision of the nature referred to in paragraph 4 on page 30 of the Memorandum in connection with the maintenance of the lighthouse. They consider, however, that it should he left to the Persian Government to raise this question.” 8. Para.11. V. r alton is writing separately to you about the Dusdap Railway* 9. Para.14. Page 12. This paragraph makes no reference to one important additional concession, viz. the abandonment of the balance of the War and post-War debt. As you know there has been discussion in the past as to whether the Minister should be authorised to offer this concession, subject to the concurrence of the Government of India and of the Treasury. It is for consideration whether it might not now be possible to give Sir R. Hoare discretion in regard to it in return for a satisfactory settlement on the other points in issue. 10. I now turn to the individual Articles of the Treaty, the position in regard to which is set out in the Appendix to the despatch. The Preamble and Articles I, Illbis IV, VIII, XI, and XII are covered by the remarks above. We have no comment on Articles IT,V, VI, VII, ex-Art* XIV, XV, or XVI, end assume that the Admiralty will examine Article III, which, so far as wo can judge, is the best we can do if Hoare finds it impossible to persuade the Persians to agree to simple notification. But please see in connection with this article the reference in paragraph 6(c) of Walton’s letter of 7th October to Praser Tytler to the possibility that the ’R.I.M.’ may become the’Indian Navy.’ 11* Ex-Article IX. Would you see any objection (v;e do not press the suggestion) to restoring a reference t in the Draft Treaty to lighting and buoying, perhaps in the shape of a two-line Article to the general effect that the H*G. parties vail deal with lighting and buoying by means of a separate agreement* The inserting of some reference in the Treaty might make it easier to obtain the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board project, or if this fails, or we decide for any reason to let it drop, mai^e it easier to press the Persians at a later stage to agree to coordination of lighting and buoying arrangements in the Gulf. And it is conceivable that the discussion which a i draft article in these terms would produce with Feroughi might give Hoare an opportunity to ascertain on what line their minds were now moving, in the light of the information they will by now have received from the French lighting and buoying expert. 12./12. Article X, Slavery. It is perhaps rather late in the day to make any alteration, but we should like to make one suggestion which appears to be really only a matter of drafting viz. the omission in Article I of the Protocol of the words ,l de l T esclavage u . The Convention of 1882 deals with the traffic in slaves: The words referred to do not appear in the draft Treaty Article or the Preamble to the Protocol, both of which merely refer to M la traite des esclaves”; the whole protocol only deals with the Slave trade on the waters of the Gulf (including territorial v/aters) and the words Tt de 1 ’esclavage” in Article 1 accordingly seem superfluous, while thereis perhaps the danger that their insertion might give the Persians an excuse for claiming an interest in anti-slavery measures in the territories of the Sheikhs on the Arab Coast, which might prove embarrassing. 13* Article XIII. As you will see from the letter to Praser-Tytler enclosed, we have asked the Government of India whether they concur in this Article in its present form, and are prepared to give the undertaking which the Foreign Office and Treasury desire. 14. I am sending copies of this letter to Moore, Grieve Parkinson, Harris, Toovey, and Bowyer. j. G. LAITHWAITE.Air Mail. ^•^P.z. 6392/33 Q J&lt;ju [ ouj * ((y* INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l 7th October, 1933. I enclose a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office covering a provisional draft of instructions to be given to Hoare as regards the resumption of the Treats negotiations with Persia, together with a very valuable a.ppendix showing tne position in July of this year on trie various Articles of the draft Treaty. We have not yet been able to take instructions here on the provisiona draft, but I enclose copy of a draft reply to the Foreign Office which we are submitting for approval^which is, I think, self-explanatory. The future of Henjam, about which I wrote to you in my air mail letter of 22nd September, No.P.Z.6051/33, is for discussion in the -iiadle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Tuesday, 10th October, and the result of that discussion may be to necessitate a further alteration of the instructions. But in view of the urgency of the matter (as Hoare is due to leave on the 11th October) I think it well to send you these papers Major W,K.Fraser-Tytler, C.M.G.,M.C., a t/ . oreign Secretary to the Government of India ^ foreign and Political Department, ’ mi DELHI.ao once and will lollow up this letter with a telegram when we have been able to take orders here. ^• ine Government of India have of course been throughout; kept in close touch with all developments in connection with the Treaty, and the instructions on which Cli ve and Hoare have in the past conducted their negotiations with the Persians were based so far as/were directly concerned on discussion with the Government of India and the India Office. A number of the Articles in t tne draf ' b treaty in these circumstances call for no comment. On certain others (such as the Bushire Residency) we have felt sufficiently sure of the view of the Government of India to feel justified in expressing agreement to the Foreign Office without waiting for your formal concurrence. But there are one or two points on which there have been recent developments as a result of which we should ke grateful if the Government of India would indicate their view. 3. The general line of the draft despatch to Hoare is, I think, satisfactory so far as we are concerned. Such criticisms as we have on it are contained in the draft to Rendel now enclosed. As I have mentioned above, the reference to Henjam (paragraph 3) must for the moment be provisional/► \ - 3 - provisional. The question of docking facilities in India (paragraph 4) is one which can in existing circumstances well he let drop. On the question of the removal of the Residency (paragraph 5) the Foreigi Office, as you will see, have adopted the suggestion made after consulting Fowle in my demi official letter to Warner of 14th September No.P.Z.5469/33, of which copies were sent you by the air mail of 16th September, and are prepared to T instruct the Minister that the question should, if at all possible, be allowed to drop. In this case a special article would be dispensed with, but there seems no reason to apprehend that difficulty should arise in view of the fact that the Resident's position in Persia would be covered by his status as Consul-General. We have assumed that the Government of India will see no objection to the proposed method cf dealing with the case, but if they do will you please telegraph. As regards the substantive question of leaving or staying at Bushire neither the Government of India nor the Secretary of State have ever in the past been enthusiastic about removal of the Residency, if this could be avoided, and while there are certain obvious advantages in its location on the Arab shore the expenditure which would be involved is in present financial — conditions/conditions a very strong argument against making any change unless this is quite inevitable. In these circumstances we have assumed, in the light of the views previosuly expressed by the Government of India, that they would share our view on this point. 4. I deal below with Article' I and Article III bis of the Treaty (paragraphs 6 and 7 of the draft despatch). The arrangements^or the preservation of our most-favoured nation rights and of the right of consular representation set out in paragraph 8 of theTdespatch, .are to some extent consequent on my demi official letter to Foreign Offi ce 0 f 14th September, No.P.Z.5469/33, to which reference is made above. The arguments for them are obvious. 5. As regards the wireless stations at Henjam, etc., the Government of India have already agreed to the transfer of the wireless apparatus at Bushire and Lingah and of the station at Henjam as part of a satisfactory treaty- settlement. The alteration now proposed by the Foreign Office in paragraph 9 of the draft instructions is merely consequential on the proposal to abandon the Kenjam Protocol. We see no objection to the draft instructions on this point and have assumed that the Government/r \ - 5 - Government of India will share our view. As regards Tamb (paragraph 10) etc.te^te^, as you will see,^su^esi^[ to the Foreign Office a redraft of this paragraph of the despatch. We are sending you a separate express letter by to-day 1 s mail as regards the Duzdap Railway (paragraph 11). ^'he question of claims (paragraph 12) is dealt with below under Article XIII of the draft Treaty. 6. I now turn to points arising out of the 'draft Treaty which may be thought to call for special consideration: ( a ) Preamble and Article I. Please see on this the demi official letter from the Foreign Office, No.E.4444/4444/34, dated 18th September 1933, of which copies were sent by the air mail of 23rd September. At the moment we are rather disposed to think that it would be preferable to substitute for the words n les Indes' in the fifth line from the end of the Preamble, the words ’’I’lnde'’, and, in the last paragraph of Article I, to amend the revised draft enclosed in the Foreign Office letter of 23rd September by the omission of the words M ou suzerainete'. The Indian States will be sufficiently covered by the comprehensive phrase 'I’lnde'. I will telegraph further on this point when the matter has been more/more closely considered, but sub ject to such further consideration and to any comment by the Government of India we would propose to accept the Foreign Office redraft. (b) As regards the Annex to Article T . please see paragraph 5 of the draft to the Foreign Office enclosed. Article This Article is of interest primarily to the Admiralty, It is, of course, proposed that we should put forward the text now suggested only after one more effort has been made to secure acceptance of 'simple notification', ihere is however one small point. I gather that there is some possibility that, if conditions seem favourable for this, a Bill for the establishment of an Indian Navy may be introduced in the Indian Legislature in the fairly near future; and that if such a Bill were to be passed the title of the Royal Indian Marine would be altered to Indian Navy. For the moment, however, it seems clear that we must continue to refer to it as the Royal Indian Marine. If the Treaty negotiations drag, it will, if necessary, be possible to send supplementary instructions to Hoare on this point. Do you agree? Article III bis. We await your views on the Foreign Office proposals regarding this Article - see our/h‘jl ► /S. - 7 - our express letter of 15th September 1933, No.P.Z.5886/32. (e) A.rticle JV. rienjam .

(g) Aroicle VI as it stands is as previously agreed. If we abandon the Henjam Protocol the future of the Henjam wireless can best be dealt with as suggested in paragraph 9 of the draft instructions to Hoare. (h) Article FII.

See our express letter of today’s date. ,§,..X• We have now secured repayment of our pre-4ar debt. There has never been much prospect of securing any payment from Persia in respect of the War and post-Jar non-interest bearing debt. Y/e have informed the Persians that in return for a satisfactory Treaty settlement we are prepared to remit £1,000,000 of the oustanding balance of £1,510,000, but we have not committed ourseives as regards the odd £510,000. The Government of India and the Secretary of State were in the past prepared, as were the Treasury, to agree that the Persians should be informed at an appropriate juncture, that we were ready to remit the balance if, as a result, we could obtain a satisfactory Treaty settlement. The Foreign Office are very anxious to give the Minister as full a discretion as possible and it is conceivable that it may be desired to give him authority to make use of this further concession, especially since, as you will see from paragraph 14 of the draft instructions, he will not have too much to negotiate with, so many of our concessions having been given away in advance. Perhaps the/the Government of India could telegraph whether they would agree, assuming that the Treasury also agree, to giving Hoare an immediate discretion on this point. Article XiII. claims. The position in regard to this Article is set out in the Appendix to the draft instructions. Would you in this connection please refer to ipy air mail letter of 2nd September 1932, No.P.2,4732/32, to the Government of India, and to the Government of India’s T,elegram of 28th September 1932, No,2160? Consequent on th a t te±egram we had further demi-official correspondence with the Treasury and the Foreign Office. The general effect of the correspondence was to show that there was apparently no record of any Persian claim against an Indian which would not be cancelled by paragraph 1 of the draft Article if this were accepted by the Persians, but tncvb there was apparently one small claim by an Indian ( the comparatively unimportant exception 11 mentioned in Metcalfe’s demi official letter of 19th May 1932, No.F.19-N/32), being a claim dating from 1905 in respect of the confiscation of certain assafoetida. ihe foreign Office, as you will see from their demi official of 20th January 1933, No.E.240/240/34, of which- 10 - copies were sent by the sea mail of 26th January, still thought that 'it would be preferable, if and when there is a reasonable prospect of resuming the Treaty negotiations, that the Ooverrment of India should be requested to assume a contingent responsibility for any such claims (i.e. Persian claims against the Government of India or against a British Indian subject which would not be cancelled by paragraph 1 of t&amp;e draft) as may hereafter be discovered, for its seems unreasonable that such a responsibility, however, remote, should be borne by His Majesty's Goverment'. The Treasury, in their demi official of 20th January 1933, No.S.34672/3 (copy by sea mail of 26th January) pointed out that 'even in the case of a claim by an Indian against a Persian the question of costs might arise. If His Majesty's Government were put to expense on this account we should expect to be reimbursed by the Government of India.' The risk of any claim by Persians seems in the circumstances described above, negligible. -^-s for claims by Indians the only one which we have been able to trace is that mentioned earlier in this paragraph. In these circumstances it seems unlikely that the Government of India would involve themselves in any substantial financial risk by accepting11 an understanding such as the Foreign Office and the Treasury suggest, and I should be grateful if you could let us know whether they would be prepared to agree to it. The present text of the draft Article is as shown in the appendix to the Foreign Office demi official of 5th October. Could you also say whether you concur in the present text of paragraph 3 of Article XIII? (o) Articles XIV, XV and .X VI of the Treaty raise no fresh point. 7. While we should of course welcome any comment which the Government of India mav care to offer on the draft Treaty, the only points on which we have felt unabl finally to commit ourselves pending an expression of thei views are those referred to in paragraph 6(a), (d), (1), (m) end (n) above, on which we should be grateful if you could telegraph as early as possible. Perhaps you would also let us know whether you agree as regards the point referred to in paragraph 6(c^ J. C.

Financial Secretary, Accountant-General, Please see Treasury letter of 20th June helow. I see no difficulty in giving the assurance required in respect of the Pre-War Debt of £490,000, since that has now been repaid in full with interest to date, hut it will he desirable to enter a caveat In respect of such other outstanding Persian liabilities as are secured on the South Persian Customs. 2} The position as regards these is that at least two substantial items in the list of Persian obligations (advancesof £409,000 made in 1915/17 and monthly advances amounting to £1,850,000 made from August 1918 to October 1920) were specifically secured on the Southern Customs at the time. In 1925/26, as you will remember, we agreed to scale down our claims against Persia and to accept a composition of £2,000,000 (of which £490,000 represented the Pre-War Interest-Bearing Debt which has now been repaid) to be extinguished through an annual payment of £180,000, representing 7 per cent, interest and 2 per cent. Sinking Fund, on the capital sum, for a period of 25 years* H.M.G. asked at the time that these payments should be secured either on the Southern Customs .Revenue or on the A.P.O.C. royalties. The Persian reply (P*1272/25) did not specifically mention either, but H.M.G., in the light of an account by sir Percy Loraine of his conversation with the present shah, considered the undertaking given sufficiently binding. A subsequent note dated 16th March 1926 (P.1427/26) made it clear that the Persians themselves had in mind either the royalties or the Southern Customs as security. The 1925 settlement has never been ratified by the Majliss and remains In suspense, nor has any interest/2 interest teen paid on the £2,000,000, save In respect of the Pre-War Debt of £490,000. binding, we are clearly directly Interested in the Southern Customs Revenue as a security for the two items mentioned in paragraph 2 above. In the alternative, our position is perhaps a little weaker, since the Persians might reply that while they had not yet been able to secure acceptance of the composition settlement they proposed, in the event of the lajliss approving that settlement, that Interest should be paid from the A.P.O.C. royalties. In any case, we shall, I think, do best to enter a caveat in quite general terms, which, subject to Foreign Office concurrence (they are informing the Treasury that they are interested in this question and wish to be consulted) might to the general effect that H.L.G. confirm that in so far as the amount of £490,000 representing the advances made by H.M.G. and the Government of India to the Persian Government during the years 1912/14 is concerned no charge or other lien on the Persian Southern Customs receipts in respect of either principal or interest any longer exists, but that it will be understood that this In no way affects the position of those receipts in so far as other advances to the Persian Government secured upon them are concerned. 3 If the 1925 settlement is to be regarded as not 1933 7358 , 1955 UJM UjJkShjU '■'■T'21 JUfil3ta ' INDEXED *Tolephone No. : Whitehall 1234.

Mr. Rendel understood that of a million sterling to the credit of the Persian Government hy the i-miglo-Persian Oil Company. £. The Foreign Office and Treasury are doth strongly in favour of accepting this payment. After discussion with Sir Cecil Kisch and Mr. Walton I said that we shared their view on the understandings, which both Treasury and Foreign Office were prepared to accept, that interest would he payable up to date of receipt and that the amount would be accepted without prejudice to our other claims against Persia. 3. The Treasury subsequently ascertained from the Bank that they nave a standing order to pay interest on the amount due every month; that they have actually paid interest up to 8th May, and that on receipt irom the Treasury of the ordinary payment slip on the 8th June they would pay interest up to June. This disposes of the necessity for a specific reference to interest. 4. As regards the remaining claims, it was agreed after discuss ion with t.hp T-rop ciim/ this^ad been made possible by a payment of a quarterGovernment of India which was advanced in the years 1912, 1913 and 1914'.

For this purpose the Persian Government propose to draw on their various deposits in Germany to the extent of £200,000 in part payment thereof.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W. 1. 29th March, 1932. 3ir # I an directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 16th March, R. 1111/208/34, on the subject of the Persian treaty negotiations, A copy of thi«i letter has been sent to the Government of India, who should receive it before the and of the month, and dir Samuel Hoare, before conraitting himself to a final expression of opinion on the comprehensive issues now raised, would wish to ascertain their general views. But he desires in the meantime to offer to Sir John Jinnon the following provisional observations on the various ooints mentioned in your letter which he has examined seriatim . 2. He concurs in the view expressed in para. 2 and lias no comment to make on the lucid and convf&gt;niont suranary of desiderata detailed in paras, 3 and 4, except that it seems right to add the general advantages to be gained by Persia by consolidating her friendship with this country, and the enhancement of her international prestige from the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty with His Majesty’s Oovernratjnt on a basis of reciprocity and equality. It may perhaps be legitimately assumed that the Persian Government (whatever their ostensible attitude) are not blind to these potential advantages and, if so, this fact, far more than any individual concession, should provide then with an inducement to meet the very moderate requirements of His Majesty’s Government* 3. As regards para. 5 of your letter, dir Barouel Hoare, while agreeing that sane of the particular concessions offered to Persia are of more importance than others, considers that taken together they cannot ba regarded as without substantial value. The War end post-far debt is admittedly unlikely to be paid by Persia, but it is in the eyes of Hia Majesty’s Government a legitimate claim, based on the agreement of 1926, and if theUiniater of Court maintains that the value of a claim depends chiefly on the value attached to it by the clairaant, it is no less open to His Majesty's Government to adopt the same attitude in rs^ard to some of their am proposed concessions. The British claim to Basidu is juridically weak, but its weakness can hardly be compared with that of the Persian claims to Tnmb, Abu llusa and Bahrein, in view especially of the facts that Baaidu has been occupied for over a century by the British md that the Persian claims are to Islands never, at least since a remote period, in their effective occupation. 4. The Dussdap railway still appears to dir B&amp;muel Hoare to be one of tiie most important bargaining assets in His Majesty*s Govemra&lt;nt's possession. It has always bean clear that it is in any case impossible for K. . Government and the Government of India without rersia's consent to retain possession, but Persia wouIg gain little from her acquisition of that section unless it was coupled with an agree lent by the Government of India to provide rolling atjck, ato., and (moat important) to operate the Indian section of the line. This the Government of India can only do at groat financial loss to themselves, and it is the prospect of this concession WfdcL gives possibilities of leverage in the negotiations. 6. Subject, however, to these observations, dir Gamuel Ho&amp;re agreste with dir Jolvi Biuion's concluaion that the Minister of Court is evidently trying to obtain a success for Persia in the negotiations even more spectacalar thjan tlmt which would have boon secured oy a settlement reached at the conclusion of Sir Hobert Clive's negotiations. The question is how far the essential desiderata of H* I* Government will p rait t)ieni to co operate with him to this end- Sir Samuel ^rees, moreover, with tne brief sunmary of the present position in pura. 6 of your letter. 6. As regards the future of the air route, Sir Samuel Hoare is impressed by the views conveyed in paras. 7 and Q ofyour letter, and subject to the observation a of the Air !;in is try, Fould be disposed to agree with dir John 3imon that the attitude suggested in para, 8 of your letter should be adopted cn this point, 7, As regards Henjrn, the oecret&amp;ry of State would wish to await the views of the Lords Comisaioners of the Admiralty, who are primarily concerned. But as at present advised, while he would be disposed to concur in the adoption of the proposal that instead of a lease a definite undertaking should be given by the Persian Oovamnont that the present facilities at Henj'^ra should b continued for a term of years, of which the number should be specified, he fears that it might be of li' tle use to obtain rm agreement with the Minister of Court, unless in a definite form which would be incorporated in the treaty. j 8. In regard to the conclusion reached in para. 12 of your lett-or, namely that if (the air route concession being separated from the general negotiations) it is not oossible to secure satisfaction from 'Mrnourtaehe on the subject of Hen jam, all the offers ?&gt;hich h vve previously bean made contingently to Persia, rith the addition presumably of the remaining *.510,000 of war debt and possibly other oonceBeions, should be made good in i ‘tun* merely for the withdrawal of the tmsubstantial Persian claims to Bahrein, T*^b, n\c\ Abu Itise, it may be doubted whether in such circumstances it is worth while to conclude a treaty at all. In this connection I am desired to refer to Sir R. Clive’s] despatch &gt; T/ ). 5'3 of June 26th, 1931, in which the conclusion ^ was reached that Us Majesty^ flovemmcnt are unlikely to be seriously inconvenienced if no general treaty is concluded for the present. If therefore Taimourtache does not recede from his present position regarding Menjem and if lie is not prepared to conclude a treaty on the general basis already nut forward by Eis Hajaaty* b CiovexT«.wnt, tiir Sarauei Hoare (thoij,.;h Via recoppises the desirability of improving our relations with Persia if possible) would suggest (subject to the views of the Government i4 Government of India and the other Imperial Lepartments concerned) that it is a matter for consideration whether it would not be preferable that the negotiations should be suspended by mutual 9. Sir Sanne 1 Hoar a, however, is not without hope that if it is made^definitely and courteously to the Persian Govemnent that the limit of concession has been reached by His Majesty*• Government and if a firm policy is adopted, in the matter of Henjam mid the air route, this policy is as likely *13 any other to mature in a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations.

March 16, 1932. Section 1. Sir, Foreign Office, March 16, 1932. WITH reference to Mr. Hoare's despatch No. 92 of the 17th February (a copy of which was sent to you on the 4th March), regarding the general treaty negotiations with Persia, 1 am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state that in his opinion it is now necessary to consider the position of these negotiations as a whole in view of the Persian Government’s latest suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should agree to withdraw the British naval depot from Henjam, and to obtain instead a prolongation of Imperial Airways’ permit to operate the South Persian air route. 2. Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will remember that in September 1930 a comprehensive memorandum, showing the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the general treaty negotiations, was communicated to the Persian Government. This document, a copy of which was enclosed in Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 467 of the 23rd September, 1930, explained that there was only one tangible advantage which His Majesty’s Government would themselves derive from the proposed treaty, and that this advantage was the continuance by agree ment with the Persian Government, for a further period, of the refuelling and recreational facilities enjoyed by British warships at Henjam. The fact, there fore, that the Persian Government are no longer willing to grant a lease of the naval depot at Henjam has changed profoundly the whole aspect of the general treatv negotiations. 3. The main advantages, tangible or otherwise, to be gained by His Majesty’s Government under the proposed treatv, as hitherto contemplated, may be summarised as follows :— (a) Henjam. Continuance for at least twenty, and possibly fifty, years of the recreational and refuelling facilities now enjoyed by His Majesty’s ships. (b) Bahrein. Abandonment of Persian claim. (c) Ta'mb and Abu Musa. Abandonment of Persian claims. (d) A non-aggression article to include the Arab sheikhdoms under British protection on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. (e) A claims article. (/) Possibly also the repayment by Persia of the capital of the £4^000 pre-war debt. Persia is, however, at present paying interest on this sum, and is understood to be likely to repay the capital shortly, apart from the general treaty. 4 4. On the other hand, the main advantages to be gained by the Persian Government are the following :— (1) The remission of all the war and post-war debt, i.e., £1,510,000 of the “ agreed debt.” Hitherto the Persian Government have only been informed of the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to waive £1 million of this sum in return for a satisfactory settlement. (2) Rendition of Basidu. (3) British recognition of Persian sovereignty over Sirri, unjustifiably seized by Persia in 1887. (4) Duzdab Railway Transfer to Persia of Persian section, and under taking by the Government of India to operate the Indian section for five years (at an estimated cost to the Government of India of 60,000 rupees a year). (3) Abrogation of Slavery Convention of 1882, which gives to British warships the right to search Persian vessels for slaves. [416 q-l ](6) Cession to Persia of wireless station at Hen jam and wireless apparatus at Bushire and Lingah. (7) Removal of British Residency from Bushire. o. The concessions offered to the Persian Government, as enumerated in the preceding paragraph, are in point of fact of less importance than at first sight appears. The Persian Government, for example, have no intention of repaying the war and post-war debt, which they consider was spent in British rather than Persian interests at a time when British troops were in occupation of the country, and which ought, so the Persian Minister of Court maintains, to be regarded as British war expenditure. The British claim to Basidu is legally so weak that it could not he maintained if seriously challenged by Persia. Again, it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India to do other than hand over to Persia the Persian section of the Duzdab Railway, built during the war on Persian territory without Persia’s consent. It is clear that the Persian Minister of Court would prefer a more spectacular success than that which he would obtain through a settlement by which Persia obtained merely the concessions set forth above. It is for this reason that he has raised the question of the withdrawal of the British naval depot from Henjam. 6. Henjam, however, is not the only point on which Teymourtache is raising difficulties. He refuses to abandon the Persian claim to Bahrein. There is no indication that he is prepared to abandon the similar claims to Tamb and Abu Musa, or that he will be prepared to agree to a satisfactory claims article. The one and only advantage which he now holds out as an inducement to His Majesty’s Government to conclude a treaty is the possibility of an extension of the permission for Imperial Airways to operate the Soutii Persian air route. 7. As regards the air route, His Majesty’s Government have carefully endeavoured hitherto to avoid giving Teymourtache the impression that they are entirely dependent upon Persia for the continuance of the British civil air route to India. In Sir John Simon’s opinion it is important to continue to take this line. If Teymourtache is given reason to believe that the Persian air route is a question of vital importance to His Majesty’s Government, there can be no doubt that he will refuse to give them satisfaction as regards Bahrein, Tamb, or Abu Musa, or, indeed, as regards any of the other points in the general treaty. Moreover, even if His Majesty's Government were to agree to accept the air route as the only tangible advantage to be derived by them from the treaty, they can have no guarantee that the Persian Government would thereafter carry out the spirit, as well as the letter, of their obligation; there can be no effective guarantee to prevent them from cancelling Imperial Airways’ concession at anv time on the pretext that the company have failed to abide by the conditions of their contract. Finally, the Secretary of State feels strongly that the acceptance of the Persian proposal would form an undesirable precedent; that it would become known, not o^ly in Persia, but also in other countries, that political concessions could be extracted from His Majesty’s Government as the price of a permit to operate air services over foreign territory; and that exactly similar difficulties would arise with the Persian Government when Imperial Airways’ new contract eventually expired. 8. Sir John Simon therefore feels that, as regards the air route, Mr. Hoare should receive instructions to take the line that this question is not one of those which was to have been dealt with in the general treaty; that if the Persian Government are finally determined to close to international traffic the only i oute aci oss I ersia, His Majesty s Government have no intention of offering them any political concessions to induce them to change their decision, hut will, if necessary, make alternative arrangements for avoiding Persian territory altogether until the Persian Government are willing to adopt a less unreasonable and obstructive attitude towards this question. Mr. Hoare would, however, make it clear that, so long as any international aviation is allowed to operate this, or any other, route across Persia, His Majesty’s Government naturally expect that Imperial Airways will he allowed to do so on the same terms 9 As regards Henjam, the Secretary of State has long been of the opinion that the Persian Government would shortly seek to bring about the withdrawal ot the British depot. At the same time, the sudden change of front on the part of the Minister of Court, after negotiations for a lease have been in progress with him for some years, is most unsatisfactory, and it might at first sio-ht appearjustifiable for His Majesty's Grovemment to take the line that this development proves that Teymourtache is not genuinely anxious to reach an acceptable settle ment, and that, in these circumstances, unless he is willing to waive his suggestion regarding Henjam, it appears useless to continue negotiations for the proposed Treaty of friendship. There are, however, strong objections to the adoption of this course. The absence of adequate legal justification for the presence of the l^^ritish naval depot in Henjam renders it impossible to continue to use the depot against the wishes of the Persian Government. If, then, the Persian Govern ment press for withdrawal, there is no possible ground for a refusal to comply with their wishes, and all that can be done is to endeavour to obtain sufficient notice to make alternative arrangements elsewhere, To break of! treaty negotia tions owing to the Persian attitude regarding Henjam would not improve the position, for, in the event of a rupture of negotiations, it would still be necessary for His Majesty s Government to comply with the Persian Government’s desire that the depot should be removed elsewhere. 10. It will be seen that Mr. Hoare suggests that the question of Henjam should be dealt with by notes, to be exchanged simultaneously with the signature of the treaty, under which His Majesty’s Government would agree to withdraw from Henjam, and the Persian Government, on their side, would grant sufficient time for alternative arrangements to be made elsewhere. Mr. Hoare has explained semi-officially that he might try to arrange for this final note from the Persian Government to contain an assurance that the units of the Gulf Squadron would still be welcomed at Henjam for recreational purposes in the course of their cruises, and he would also endeavour to secure an interpretation of the term recreational purposes, ' in a semi-official letter from Teymourtache, as meaning that the canteen, club and football ground could be retained. 11. While there can be little doubt that, if the Persian Government insist on a withdrawal, it will be necessary to accept a settlement on the lines proposed by Mr. Hoare, if this can be arranged, it might be possible at the outset to approach Teymourtache on somewhat different lines in the hope of reaching a more satisfactory solution. Mr. Hoare might say that negotiations have been proceeding for years on the assumption that Teymourtache was prepared to agree to a lease of Henjam; His Majesty’s Government now wish to hold his Highness to his previous agreement to come to a mutually satisfactory arrangement on this question. If, however, his Highness does not wish to enter into a formal lease, such as that hitherto under discussion, His Majesty’s Government will be satisfied if he will agree that His Majesty’s ships shall for a certain period of years enjoy the facilities for recreation and refuelling at Henjam which they have enjoyed in the past; and it would be well if Mr. Hoare were in a position to add that the forthcoming arrival of the new Persian navy seemed to render it possible lor His Majesty s Government to repay the Persian Government foi* facilities granted to His Majesty’s ships at Henjam bv providing facilities, though of a somewhat different kind, for the new Persian navy. Tor example’, Mr. Hoare might point out that the Persian Government will inevitably find that their new warships, if they are to be maintained in a seaworthy condition, will require the normal docking facilities at certain stated periods' and that, until the Persian Government have provided such docking facilities for themselves, it might be convenient for them to be allowed to use such facilities as are available in Indian dockyards. Although the Secretary of State is not confident that this line of approach would offer a satisfactory solution, he considers it desirable at least to explore the possibility of offering the Persian Government advantages for their navy, such as docking facilities, and I am to enclose a copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Admiralty on this point. 12. Finally, as regards the General Treaty negotiations as a whole, it seems necessary to decide which are the essential points upon which Mr. Hoare should stand firm. If, as explained above, it is not proposed to accept as a basis of negotiation the offer of the South Persian air route as the sole advantage to be gained by His Majesty s Government from the treaty, and if it is impossible to obtain as a result of the treaty the facilities required at Hen jam it seems necessary to concentrate on the other British desiderata enumerated in paragraph 3 above. More especially, it seems desirable that the Persian claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa should be finally disposed of as a result of the general settlement. The Persian claim to Bahrein, in particular however ill-founded it may be, is inconvenient on account of the considerable expenditure4 involved in the construction there of a new naval depot as an alternative to&gt; Henjam, and of a new Residency as an alternative to Bushire. It is highly desirable that, before incurring such expenditure. His Majesty’s Government should be assured of absolute security of tenure, such as can be achieved only by the final abandonment of the Persian claim. It is therefore to be hoped that Mr. Hoare will be able to persuade the Persian Government to agree at least to abandon these claims as a result of the general settlement, and in return for tl^- war debt, the Duzdab Railway, Basidu, Sirri, the transfer of the Residency, anu such other concessions as it is proposed to make to Persia. 13. The Secretary of State will be glad to learn if Sir Samuel Hoare agrees generally in the views expressed above. 14. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Colonial Office, Dominions Office, Treasury and War Office, and copies of letters which are being addressed to the Admiralty regarding Henjam and to the Air Ministry regarding the air route are enclosed herein for the information of Sir Samuel Hoare.

(K 4731/2982/34) Gulhek, oeptember 7th, 1931 My Lord Marquess With reference to my despatch No. 473 of the 31st ultimo I have the honour to report that on September let I took an opportunity to enquire of the Minister of Finance as to the explanation of the Persian Government’s change of mind respecting the proposed repay ment of the pre-war debt. A copy of their note conveying this decision (of which a copy was enclosed in my despatch under reference) is enclosed herewith for facility of reference. Taqizadeh seemed at first unable to give me a very coherent account. I observed that His Majesty's Government could not but be surprised that before even I had received instructions as to the re'ly to be given to the offer of the transfer of fixdd bank deposits in place of cash, itself a modification of the original offer to repay, I should be asked by the Persian Government to inform His Majesty's Government that the offer to repay in any form was withdrawn for the present. Taqizadeh stated that the banks would have charged half per cent for releasing the deposits and this the Persian Government refused to pay. I pointed out that even so it would have been advantageous for the Persian Government compared with the continued payment of the seven per cent interest. This seemed The Most Honourable The Marquess of Reading G. C. B. , etc. , etc. , etc. , The Foreign Office. etc.seemed a new idea to Taqizadeh. But he added that His Majesty’s Government also had refused to nay the half per cent to obtain the release of the funds and had signified this refusal to the ersian Legation in London. He wished me to understand that negotiations on this point had been in progress between Your Lordship’s Department and the ersian Legation, to whom His Majesty’s Government’s refusal to acceot the bank deoosits in repayment had been signified. C could oiily exoress my surprise at this statement and I enquired whether the note from the Minister for Foreign ' ugust 27th (see my despatch under reference) did not in fact originate with himself, Taqizadeh. He replied in the negative. 2 . I was becoming somewhat bewildered, when Taqizadeh uttered his first intelligible sentence. He volunteered the statement that when His Majesty’s Government hesitated to accept the offer, the Persian Government themselves began to hesitate and it had been decided (he did not say by whom? he did not say, by himself, although it might be natural to suppose that such a decision might be taken by the Minister of 'finance: he im lieci that the decision was one over which he had had no control) that it was imprudent to reduce the reserves lying in foreign banks and destined to form the basis of the new currency. I enquired when there was any prospect of a renewal of the offer of repayment. Taqizadeh explained that all the deposits in question fell due at the same time at the end of the ersian year, namely March 20th next - he had arranged this uniformity. Byithet time it mightmight he possible to tell whether any of the reserves could be soared, as the transition to the new currency would have been accomolished, and perhaps the offer might be renewed then. 3. I may add that Mirza Kissa Khan Paiz, Persian Government Commissary attached to the Anglo-^'ersian Oil ^moany, at oresent in Tehran, in conversation with me a few days ago, claimed to have nu*de the original suggestion for reoayment of the four hundred and ninety thousand pounds; he said that his object had been to save paying so high a rate of interest. when I told him that the offer had been withdrawn, he seemed astonished but supposed that the reason was fear of depleting the reserves, (as Taqizadeh afterwards explained). 4. It is not without interest to note in this connexion that the ^nglo-Persian Oil Company’s monthly sales of sterling in Persia, the whole of which accrues to the ‘ersian Government, have recently been reduced from ninety thousand to forty-five thousand pounds. duch a shrinkage in the supply of foreign currency may well have influenced the Persian Government to husband existing funds. 5. ince my interview with Taqizadeh on eptember 1st, I have received Your Lordship’s despatch No. 465 of August 20th (E 4256/2982/34), enclosing records of two , p z rztf/u interviews with the Persian Chargd d’Affaires on August 13th and August 17th. This despatch provides an explanation of His Excellency’s statement that the Persian Chargg d’- ffaires riad been informed that the Proposed method of payment by thethe transfer of Bank deposits would be inocceptable if it involved the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of a reduced rate of interest until the deposits were released. But it does not provide a comnlete explanation as to why the Persian Government’s note of August 2Srd (which was summarised in my telegram No. 192 of August 26th) should have been followed so shortly afterwards by their note of August ^27th (which was summarised in my telegram No. 194 of August 29th). A possible explanation is that the nature of the conversation which the Persian Charg4 d’Affaires had at the Foreign Office on August 17th only became known to the Ministry of Finance after the first note had been despatched by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. But it is more likely, as I have already indicated, that the change of front was dictated by deeper reasons connected with the financial requirements of the Persian Government. 6. I venture to add that it would have been of great assistance to me if the telegram(No. 135 of August 21st) instructing me to obtain the fersi&amp;n Government’s proposals for the transfer of bank deposits in writing could have contained an intimation of the nature of the warning given to the Persian ChargS d’Affaires on August 17th. 7.

No. 18299 dated Murdad 51st 1510 (August 25rd 1951) Monsieur le Charge d*Affaires, In the course of the interview which you had yesterday with His excellency Chaffar Khan Jelal you stated that the Treasury of the honourable British Government, before taking a decision in connection with the proposal made by the Imperial Government in respect of the payment of the sum of Tomans (sic) 490,000 capital and interest, wishes that explanations may be offered in writing in respect of the following points:- On which bank the draft will be drawn for this payment? hat is the amount of the deposit of the Imperial Government at the said bank? What is the period of the deposit and when would it expire V vhat is the rate of interest paid by the bank to the Persian Government (on account of the said deposit) V * ill draft which the Imperial Government will issue on the bank for payment of capital and interest at the rate of 7% be till the expiry of the period of deposit of the money or not? I now have to give you the following explanations in respect of the points raised above fhe banks with whom the Persian Government have deposited money and on which they (the Persian Government) can drawdraw cheques are as follows:- National Provincial Ban* of Kngland with interest of and 2$. Lloyds Bank: with interest of Imperial Bank: of Persia with interest of 2^. The amount of the deposit placed in each of the two latter banks is not sufficient to meet the payment of the whole advance, but in the first-mentioned bank: money is available for more than the amount required. The date on which the period of deposit expires would be the end of the present Persian year, namely on March 20th 1952 and, as Aghai Jelal has pointed out verbally to Mr* Lascelles, the proposal of the Persian Government is to the effect that the amounts of the advance should be paid with interest at the rate of seven per cent until the day on which the amount available in the bank is transferred to the honourable British Government and after the date of transfer, the deposited amount together with the interest payable by the bank to the Persian Government should be paid to the British Government* The intention of the Imperial Government was to pay these advance monies immediately, but as it became known that the amounts in cash of the Persian Government are deposited with the banks up to March 20th next and that they (the Persian Government) cannot, before the expiry of the period of deposit, secure the transfer of the same, they (the Persian Government) had, with a view to settling this debt, submitted this proposal which makes actually no diXTerence to the British Government. It is understood that in case (the British Government) extend their assistance by accepting the proposal, their help (good offices) would be appreciated* I avail etc* (Ggd.)

(4) Persian Government propose that advance should he repaid with interest at 7 per cent to date on which sum on deposit is transferred to Kis Majesty’s Government. (5) After date of transfer His Majesty’s Government will receive hank rate interest until March 20th. Note states that proposal makes actually nc differ ence to His Majesty’s Government. By this Persian Govern ment mean that' if the whole sum were repaid tomorrow without restriction His Majesty's Government could only obtain hark rate interest upon it. I have already pointed out it is no concern of Persian Government what His Majesty's Government do with the money. Note adds that if His Majesty’s Government can give their assistance it will he appreciated. Text by hag today. Please telegraph instructions.

Your letter of the 14th August (K.4216/S-82/34 ) about the latest Persian proposal for the repayment of the are-war debt. I feel some doubt whether there is much advantage in trying to matce political capital in the manner I odd proposes out of what ought to be a purely business transaction. We should be quite glad to have the money and I do not think that we need take the initiative in suggesting that the matter should be postponed for six months or any other period. The suggestion that the Bank deposits should be transferred to us was only made orally, and 1 should have thought it would be enough for looa to enquire orally whether the Persian Government are prepared to transfer bank deposits to such a figure as, with accrued int erest,~ interest, will amount at date or aetarity to the amount of the pre-war debt together with Interest at to the same date. If the Persian Government are preparer to do this I do not see any reason to refuse, but, if this line is followed, odd should also as* the exact date of maturity of the deposits, as there might be some objection if they do not mature during the current financial year. The exact figure could then protably best be worked out in London. If the Persians are not prepared to do this, the proposal should be refused, and it would be for them to suggest an alternative. Ae regerde possible payment in Treasury Bonds, we could no doubt take these over at a valuation, but I understand that we do not want to hold the Bonds and would have to sell them on the market.• ✓ % A^; j %&gt; i Wp 'S u ili. 4215/2982/34.

Our only comment at the present stage is that it would seem preferable, if it is decided to repl,/ on the general lines suggested by Dodd, not to say that His Majesty’s Government will be content with repayment in six months 1 time , but to say instead that they will be content with repayment when the Persian Govern ment are no longer embarrassed, i’he reference to six months was made, not by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, but by the Head of the English Section in the Persian Foreign Office, who refused to put it in writing.

PERSIAN PRE WA R iBBT « The Counsellor of the Persian Legation celled to-day with reference to our letter of August 10 to the Persian Minister. He said that a furthet telegram had just been received from his Covemment, expressing the hope that this question might shortly be settled, and that a reply would very soon be received from His Majesty’s Government • j.he telegram went on to say that, if His Majesty's Government agreed, the Persian Government proposed to repay the £490,000 in 4j^j Treasury bonds which they hold. I thanked Monsieur Noury for informing us of this suggestion, and said we would look into it. At the same time, I thought it would be best if we were to defer our reply pond ing receipt of the reply from the Persian Government to the note which Mr. Dodd had been instructed to address to them on this subject. The Persian Ministry of Finance might after all change their minds, and decide to send us a cheque, as we have suggested and not to proceed further with the suggestion of treasury bonds. If we were to reply regarding the Treasury bonds suggestion, our letters would probably cross, which might lead to confusion. Monsieur Noury agreed that it might be best not to reply until we had received the reply to Mr. Dodd's note. e would, however, inform the Persian Government that he had approached us in accordance with his instructions, and that we were con sidering the suggestion regarding the Treasury bonds, but would probably await their reply to Mr. Dodd’s note.

Persian government’s financial reason for wishing to repay is clearly to stop paying so high a rate of interest as soon as possible. Political motive is probably to be able to patronise His Majesty’s Government by pretending that it has come to His Majesty’s Government’s assistance at a time of general depression by repaying an old debt, thus proving Persian government’s financial stability in contrast to other countries. Furthermore in spite of Treasury’s re assurance on this point Persian government may intend to pose before International Money Market as having i &lt; ixs 4_; u&lt;&lt; * discharged the whole ( g^p^—unele^r-.) debt with a view to contracting a fresh loan on unmerited credit. I consider it important at this juncture not to lose such moral ascendancy here as His Majesty’s Government still enjoy and I suggest I should return in writing a reply to the effect that His Majesty’s Government appreciate this effort of the Persian government to liquidate this obligation at a time when • Persia’s finances are a source of such embarrassment to Persian government. His Majesty's Government do not wish to press Persian government for repayment until2 . it is convenient for latter to conclude these sri angements for realising their assets. The loan v/as rriacle in cash at 7 per cent and of course rnust be repaid in cash and bear that interest to day of repayment. His Majesty’s Government will be contented with repayment in 6 months time if Persian government are no longer embarrassed then. I understand Imperial Bank of Persia in London can furnish details of investments alluded to by Persian government in any case in so far as 2 amounts of £200,000 each are concerned.In any further communication on this subject, please quote n„. 34- j address —not to any person by name, but to— ^TjJe Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

On the receipt of your letter we went through our draft telegram to see whether we could produce a compromise which would meet both your points and ours, and we eventually submitted to our higher authorities here a re-draft, the relevant paragraphs of which ran as follows:- 'His Majesty’s Secretary of State for foreign 'Affairs has been notified by the Persian legation 'in London of the wish of the Persian Government 'to repay forthwith the sum of £490,000, being that 'part of the Persian Government’s debt to His 'Maj esty’ s •. • J.G.

The Foreign Office state that interest on the prewar Persian debt is paid monthly and that the last month’s interest was paid on 8th July. In these circumstances they suggest that it will suffice if we ask for a cheque for the capital sum with the interest due to the date of payment. Mr. Kj^ ch^agrees, but would omit the words underlined^hi^pblnt being that the Persians might pay us on, say, 1st August, and intimate that as the interest for the month in which 1st August fell was not due until August 8th, we were not entitled to claim it. Vie can put this to the Foreign Office. Sir Robert Clive called to see Sir Lancelot Oliphant this morning and made a counter suggestion which is shown on the draft below. Sir Lancelot Oliphant, after considerable discussion, was prepared to accept it, but the Eastern Department do not like it. I cannot help feeling (and Mr. Fisch agrees) that we should do much better to stick to the original draft. That draft makes it quite clear that the £490,000 is M part ... of the Persian Government’s debt to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India', and equally that it is the pre war portion of that debt. If we complicate the issue by a pointed reference to the controversial question of the agreed debt of £2,000,000 (the Majlis have never ratified the agreement), we may well provoke an acrimonious reply fron the Persians and a subsequent controversy. His Majesty's Government will be nonethe better off for this and may lose the immediate receipt that there now seems some hope of their being able to expect. I submit that I might be authorised to write to Mr. Rendel as in the draft attached. U . I^aLA ^4 /r*\ DraJ (Draft Paper. Department. Pi ktrK/l) 35b 11000 5.31 Unless/ E m 'Vnj -T G.' ,r .

But we are inclined to feel strongly that the original draft ( M that part of the Persian Government’s debt to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India which was advanced in the years 1912, 1913 and 1914 M ) cb&amp;G Ct\ f%Myx~C^U thic qui4e adequately, and has the further great advantage of avoiding the possibility of a sharp reply from the Persians and a controversy as to their liability in respect of the balance of £1510,000. We should gain nothing from such a controversy - our position in regard to the war and postwar debt has been made abundantly clear, and it is quite conceivable that we might lose the chance of securing a fairly substantial capital receipt from the Persian Government.jm—m r- Unless, therefore, the Foreign Office have a strong view in the matter, ee &lt;j&gt;ould prefer the original draft to stand. On a minor point, the financial Secretary suggests in the penultimate paragraph of the draft the following rewording!- 'sum with interest to the date”. His point is that, interest being payable to the 8th 01 the nor hi, the Persians mi^it claim in the event of their paying the capital suiji, etc., on.e.g., 1st September, that we have no claim to interest between 9th August and that date, on the ground that it did not fall due until 8th September. The point is a small one, but may be worth taking.S3948/2982/34 \ h Jjaaoellea, Tahran. No• • • • B* Politioal diatributioo. Repeat to India Uo. •«« Copy to 1.0* Treasury. July 31 3ir ii.

As it is desirable to talce any offer of ready cash from these people, I concur in the acceptance of the offer of the Persians. As regards the interest for the broken period you might land yourself in an awkward #qu*fcble if nothing is said about it now and the Persians choose to treat the payment of £490,000 as wiping out the balance of interest for the broken period. My suggestion, therefore, is that you might indicate that the payment should be made on a day which would leave an exact number of months’ interest to be added to the capital and that you should say to the Persians that, for the purpose of convenience, it is proposed that the payment should be made on such and such a day which with X months’ interest would mean an aggregate payment of so much, being £490,000 capital plus X months* interest. 3rd July 1951 .Draft Paper. ft.

Dear Laithwaite, Since our meeting on July 15th to discuss the Persian pre-war debt, there has been a further development which will necessitate a substantial change in the action then agreed upon. The Persian Counsellor called on me on July 20th and said that, according to a further telegram received from Tehran, the Persian Government now desired not to fund the debt, but to repay the whole pre-war debt, i.e. four hundred and ninety thousand pounds, as soon as possible. I enclose a draft telegram which we propose, subject to Treasury and India Office concurrence, to send to Dodd on this subject. We would also inform the Persian Minister here in the same sense as soon as Dodd has had time to act on our telegram. We shall be glad to know as soon as possible if you have fa, jul VI any J.G.

We are assuming that the Persian offer to repay the debt implies that they will pay interest up to the actual date of repayment.

Sir Robert Clive's despatch No. 293 of 12th June enclosed in the letter from the Foreign Office now submitted gives a full account of the conversations on this subject with the Persian Government. We should be glad to see the prewar loan of £490,000 funded on satisfactory terms, if this could be done without prejudice to the position of the balance of the Persian debt to us, and agreement has been reached between the Treasury, the Government of India and this Office as to the funding terms which might be offered to the Persians. But we may agree with the Foreign Office that it is very important to do nothing - more especially now that the general negotiations with Persia are interrupted - which could weaken our claim to the balance of £^510,000 due to us by Persia. We have^all along been prepared to abandon this £1510,000 in return for a satisfactory settlement, and we have even gone so far as conditionally to promise remission of £1,000,000 of it.X^The Persians in the course of the negotiations proved to attach a quite unexpected importance to remission of the balance of £510,000. [ In the circumstances , The line now suggested by the Foreign Office is probably on the whole the best. If the Persians are prepared formally to recognise that the amount of their agreed debt to us is £2,000.000 (£450,000 being prewar), we need raise no objection to the funding of the prewar portion/of portion, and we shall be in a stronger position to bargain with the balance of £1510,000 when the time comes to resume negotiations. If, in the light of a reply on the lines suggested by the Foreign Office, they prefer to leave matters as they are rather than formally reiterate their acceptance (which has never been confirmed by the Majlis) of £2,000,000 as the agreed final figure their indebtedness to us, we shall be none the worse off, so long as they continue to pay their interest on the prewar debt. Were they to desist from paying that i interest, the effect on their credit - the position of which is already far from satisfactory - could not but be unfortunate, and it is to be hoped that they will be reluctant to face it.

Subject to any observations which Mr. Benn and the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury may wish to offer, Mr. Henderson does not consider it desirable to propose to the Persian Government at the present stage any detailed scheme of repayment on the lines suggested in Treasury letter No. F.10207/6 of the 15th May, 1929, and previous correspondence. He would suggest instead that the reply to be returned to the Persian Charge d*Affaires might first recapitulate the position with regard to the agreed debt of two million pounds. It might proceed to state that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India will be ready at any time to negotiate for the redemption of this two million pound debt. They note the Persian Government’s wish to repay that part of the two million pounds which was advanced to Persia before the war, i.e. four hundred and ninety thousand pounds.

If this arrangement should not prove convenient to the Persian Government, His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India would be ready to consider any proposals which the Persian Government may wish to put for ward, provided always that due account is taken of the fact that the total amount of the debt is two million pounds, and that this fact is fully provided for in any settlement which may be reached. 3.

On the occasion of an interview with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs some two or three weeks ago His Highness suddenly said that the Minister of Finance had spoken to him about the pre-war debt of £490,000 on which interest was being paid, but for the redemption of which no provision had hitherto been made. 3. I replied that now that our Treaty negotiations were in abeyance, it seemed to me quite out of the question to t?ike a portion - about one quarter - of the Persian debt and negotiate its redemption. The indebtecness of the Persian Government had after long negotiations been fixed in the Spring of 1926 at the round sum of two million pounds, a reduction of considerably over fifty per cent. The Persian Government had officially admitted this. If His Majesty’s Government were now to agree to the suggestion of the Minister of Finance, I said, His Highness must admit that the impression would be created that they had practically renounced the remaining one million five hundred and ten thousand pounds sterling of debt.

We approached the British Minister hut he does not seem disposed to help us in the matter, stating that the British Government have a claim of £4,000,000 against the Persian Government, although he is ready to make certain deductions, and that this question should he settled together with the principal questions, adding that if he settled these claims it would he prejudicial to other claims.

No developments have since taken place, and the general negotiations have now, for practical purposes, broken down. The Foreign Office are inclined to think that the demarche of the Persian Charge d’Affaires reported in their telegram of 10th June to Sir Robert Clive may be dictated by a desire to secure some further concession from us in the shape of a reduction of the interest payable on the debt. If +u, a • 1 this is m fact the case/ —,—case, there is no reason why we should make any concession. But it seems at least equally probable, having regard to their present financial difficulties, that the Persians may be contemplating raising money in this country, and may be anxious to make arrangements for the payment of their one solid liability to this country. We must, however, await the further observations which Sir Robert Clive has been asked to furnish. It is conceivable that the Minister may have taken the line that it was undesirable to deal with any of the outstanding questions between us and Persia save as part of a general settlement. But it would be worth getting the pre-war debt repaid, if possible, and if the Persians really want to arrange for its funding there is no reason why we should stand out.
