Sir, L hare the hoaour to give some uetails regarciag the visit of His Highness rince ^hmad Tauhid aaa Jamal asha to Jahraia- The former who is a graadsoa of E.I.&amp; the late ~ultaa ;baul Aziz of Turkey appears to be of ao iaportaace. He has little money and is out of sympathy with .rabs,though full of praise for Bia Ca'ud who apparently received him well during the last Baj. 3. Jamal Pasha however is a very intelligent man and speaks English well ana French fluent]^. He is in Bin fa’ud’s service having formerly been ar r, inister. He informed me that he had been on a mission to discover the cause of the great drop in the number of pilgrims to the Hedjaa. He found this to be largely the result of bad trade but also the result of a certain amount of entity shown to Bin Sa’ud. i^ater hu somewhat unnecessarily showed me a letter from His Majesty authoriziag hi ; to tliank a prominent hombay merchant for his help to Islam ana asked me to draft o congratulatory telegram to him. The n asha has travelled extensively in India recently and also had visas for the Hutch Last Indies which he had not used. 3. He then asieu me if he might speak confidentially to me. !te told me that his real object was to sound Moslem opinion in India ana yria with regard to a Moslem Conferencethat 3ia Cb’ucI ia view y tue object beia^; to uaito the Islamic fold aj»u assist the pilgrimage* He tola me taat 'ia ::a ? ud full/ sympathized with our difficulties ia imaia aaa tiiat he wisiied to rally Moslems to our side, rid I thiak he could usefully iaterveae ia this aiatter? Could 1 gite him a letter of aay kind which he could use ia tuis coui.ection? i replied tiat I was far from ladia and out of touch with IkaJ’ U*. Moslem opinion and^ue no uoubt would have iiaa bettor opportun ities of forming an opinion from contact with both officials and ?!oslemsh he i , eaiately cropped this line and did not return to it* 4. He told me that on arrival in ’Iraq am more especially in k/ria he would give out this suggestion of a Conference to the press *nd that after reporting to Bin fte’ud he would return to India with a view to encouraging the haj. I personally consider the Congress is a blind but report the facts in view of the rumour prevalent in the Uraq papers tiiat a Congress is to be called in ales tine unuer naahiaite influence with a view to reinstating the ex-; ultan of Turkey as Khalifa. The rumour states that the Shaikhs on the Tersian lulf Littoral have been approacned and that there has been no sign of any s ch invitation having b en received here,it is just possible that the hsha raay be preparing a counterblast rm i nave seen sign of it* his real erraua in ly opinion is to discover the cause of the very serious drop in pilgrims and to find menus of combating it. b. lie was emphatic that a collision between Imam Yahyia ana Bin Ga v ud was only a question of time since Bin a’ud coulci not tolerate any foreign penetration of Arabia ana since it was well known that the Bolschevists had gainea a very strong hold in the Taman# he mentioned tJiat while he was ar :j f ■i Minister he had been asked to make out a plan for the subjecatio: of the emen and to estimate its cost anu it was found that it || coulu not be done for less than a million 8terling;«xd so Bin— Bin rsud wes reluctantly obli ea to postpone it and at the present moment pnd tuat at the present noaient suon a conflict was not within the realms of jractical politics.
