As the result of experience of flying boat operations at Gwadar, it was found that its exposed position and the extensive shoal water in been accentuated during the monsoon. in consultation with the Air Ministry, therefore, an alternative site was sought, with more sheltered water. The mouth of the Dasht River in Gwatar Bey was first examined and fo*nd unsuitabxe, but another water area in Khor Jiwani in K&amp;lat State, 40 miles west of Gwadar was found which appeared to be suitable for seaplane operations. Air and ground surveys of Lhor Jiwani were then carried out, and a successful trial landing by one of the Empire Fljing Boats was made on the 9th May, and confirmed the suitability of the site for seaplane operations. The consent of His Highness the hhan of Kalat was t;.en obtained for its regular use by Imperial Airways. A temporary pontoon Jetty and mooring buoys were provided and a portable office building was moved from Gv/adar landing ground to Jiwani. The control launch with W/T moved to Jiwani, and Imperial Airways personnel were allowed to use the State Rest House. The regular flying boat services began to use Jiwani with these temporary arr-ngements from 13th May 1938. Detaileu estimates and plans for the development of a seaplane station at Jiwani on a permanent basis have been for arded to Air Ministry. For the time being communication is being maintained with the Gwrdar wireless and Meteorological stations through the medium of tue control West Bay, presented certain difficulties which would iia-elaunch wireless set, hut the Air Ministry desir s, if possible, to close down their wireless station at Gwadar before the 24th October, when their existing arrangement with the Sultan of Muscat expires, and to transfer the whole of the organisation to Jiwani at the same time, Jiwani would then becorae a stopping place for landplanes as well as seaplanes. A Gov ernment of India emergency landing ground at jr esent exists at Jiwani; b t, as there is a suitable site for an aerodrome more conveniently situated close to the seaplane station, the Air Ministry are considering the development of this new aerodrome, detailed plans for which are being prepared.to Tto« Kott'bl* t The Under Se in the ^ and Chief Co^nleeioner in Bel ue his tan* Hated Simla» the ^2-2^ June 1958.

It has been ascertained that no lent is paid to the Rulers of Gwalior and Udaipur for the use by Imperial Air ways of lakes in their s States, that these States are bearing much of the expenditure on construction and that the Maharaja of Jodhpur has actually developed the aero drome in Jodhpur at his own expense as a State venture. It is hoped therefore tnat if tne proposal for a landing place in tne Gwatar Bay materialises, the Ilian of Kalat will not xk ask for any rent to be paid. Yours sincerely, Sd.

Survey of Khor Jiunri. Dear colonel, Please refer to correspondence ending with our Con fidential memorandum No .P .76-F/3Q, dated tne 14th March 1938. survey tne Air Ministry and Imperial Airways have decided that they should transfer their flying boat base from G-wadur to Jiunri as early as possible. This they will have to do within tne next six weeks before the advent of the monsoon makes communications between G-wadur and Jiunri by sea im possible. In fact they wish to move a hut and tents from G-wadur to Jiunri and erect a small jetty at the latter place at once. 3. The details of the works which it will be necessary to construct at Jiunri are not yet available, but would probably consist of the foilowing (1) A Kachcha office building and a small pontoon jetty at tne Ahor ^iunri; (2) About 2-g- miles distant from tne jetty, Kachcha quarters for personnel with a sweet water well; (3) ijiiotorable track between the jetty and the quarters. 4. The use of the water in Khor Jiunri should not, it is believed, interfere with fishermen and native craft, but it will probably be necessary for Imperial Airways to be given certain privileges so as to be able to keep the area to be used for landings and h take offs clear during the time of use. 5. Imperial Airways will keep their control launch at Jiunri and this launch will be fitted with wireless for the prupose of communicating with the G-wadur Wireless station. The Company will make their own special arrangements for 2. I am desired to say that as a result of the recent refuellingrefuelling and for supplies* 6* If they find Jiunri satisfactory in practice it is probable that permanent development will follow both at the seaplane station and the Jiunri landing-ground. This will involve the establishment of a permanent wireless station at Jiunri and a meteorological observatory and cbher build ings for personnel and passengers, ouch development may per haps lead to steamers making Jiunri a regular port of call and is, it is considered likely, to be to the advantage of Kalat State. 7. I am to request,you, if you see no objection, kindly to consult the Khan of Kalat and to telegraph as soon as possible whether action to transfer the flying boat base to Jiunri on tne lines described may be taken immediately. 8. I am durther to request that, if you see no objection, it may be suggested to the Khan that he snould allow the use of any land and v/ater required free of rent,c.f. my demi- official letter to Caroe, No .D.591-F/38, dated the 4th of February 1938. The necessary buildings will be constructed by the Central Public Works Department in accordance with Imperial Airways* requirements. 9. The position with regard to customs duties on material etc imported at Jiunri will have to be considered, but it is hoped that if any duties are charged they will be as light as possible. The master is being examined here, but we should be grateful for any observations you may have to make re garding it in due course. To Yours sincerely, 3d. W.R.Hay.

Daar Colonel, Please refer to my demi-official letter No.F.76-F/38 dated ixx 19th April 1938. 2. I am desired to ®.y that it is understood that there is at Jiunri a Kalat State Rest House which is used by visiting officers, it is believed that this Rest House is little used by such officers during the summer months and Imperial Airways would be very grateful if they could be permitted to use it as a temporary measure for their personnel until more permanent arrangements for their housing can be madex. u ntil actual experience of flying boat operations at Jiunri has been obtained, Imperial Airways are unwilling to put in hand the building of any permanent quarters. Al though they could make shift with the hut they are transfer- ing from Gwadar and with tents, it would make for the comfort of their personnel if they could be allowed to use the State Rest House. The Director, Civil Aviation does not think there is much doubt that Jiunri will be found suitable for the flying boats and work on the quarters should, therefore, be put in hand at an early date. 1 t will thus probably be only for the summer months that Imperial Airways will wish to use the Rest house, if a favourable reply is received from the Khan of Kalat to the proposal for the establishment of a Seaplane base at Jiunri, and you see no objection, would you kindly endeavour to xe obtain permission for the use of the Rest house in the manner proposed. 3. I am to add that information has been received from the Air Ministry that they would like to arrange for the evacuation of Owadar before October next when their existing agreement with Muscat expires. This will involve the trans fer of the wireless station from G-wadar to Jiunri and KSueh whether it will be possible to make this transfer in the time remains to be seen. Other developments, both at the seaolane station and the landing ground, wiiynaturally follow - *r if a definite decision is readied to substitute Jiunri for G-wadar, but a decision must, depend inter alia on the report received from the flying boat which first lands at Jiunri. i.

Please refer to your demi-official letter ho. P.7u-F/38, dated the 19th April 1938. I have sent you a telegram and now attach a copy of a letter To.2291, dated the 26th April 1938, from idwards. I have not yet received ajiefinite answer from His Highness about rent and customs, but will inform you as soon as possible. I am inclined to agree with fdwards that a nominal rent should be charged for the water and land, and think that His Highness will be willing to allow the material for initial construction in free. He will naturally libok to the case of G-wadur as a guide, and it would be useful to me to know ahat concessions were given there.(g) 0 frnr,^- 0 /p a T 0 f^icia.! letter Lo.2291, dated tne 26th April irom .ajor o.u.i . jdwards, PoliticalAgent in Kalat, ‘ 5 Lan;; ( X Please refer to Hay’s demi-official letter No.F76-j/38, datd one 19bn April 193b, a copy of which was forwarded to me by the Agent to the G-ovemor (General* I saw His Highness the Khan at Kalat yesterday and handed him a copy of the enclosed memorandum. His Highness welcomed the decision and asked me to tell the Agent to the Governor General that he would do all in his power to facilitate the transier and gave his assurance that he would ap^roaciu all ques tions connected with it x in a spirit of most friendly co-opera tion and v/ould not put any difficulties in the way. He was wiiiiDg unwilling to commit himself to any definite replies on the questions of customs duties and rent free use of land and water until he had consulted his advisers; but he is coming to vuetta on tiie 28th April, and he may have been able to form a definite opinion by then. Meanwhile he hopes that action will be put in hand immediately to transfer the flying boat base to Jiunri on the lines described. I do ..ot appear to have received a copy of Hay’s a.o # .,o. 3.591-F/36 of the 4th February 1938 (referred to in para 8 of his letter oi the 19th April 1938). 3o I am unaware how strongly the Govern ent of India wish to press for rent free use of land and water. Prima f acie I would be inclined to think that it would be better for the Khan to charge a nominal rent, in order to ensure permanent recognition of his ownership and sovereignty; but I did not, of course, make any such suggestion to His Highness. As regards customs duties, the duties charged by the Kalat dtate at Pasni and Jiunri are very much lighter than those charged in British Indian ports; and I believe that the State might be prepared to make some special coneession to Imperial Airways in respect of materials imported for construction work I believe that His Highness proposes to call on the Agent to the Governor General at Quetta on the morning of 29th April; so if Golonel Parsons would like to discuss Kalat quesuions with me before he sees the Khan, I could be ready for discussion at any time on the afternoon or evening of the 28th. I shall be at the Dak Bungalow at fuetta; and you could address any communica tion to me there to wait my arrival on the 28th. .I emorand om As a result of the recent survey the Air ministry and Imperial Airways have decided that they should transfer their flying boat base from G-wadar to Jiunri as early as possible, they will have to do within the five weeks, before the advents of the monsoon makes comr uni cations bet\veen Grw.dar and Jiunri by sea impossible.

Hitherto Gwadur has been used as a permanent stop on the Empire Air Route to India and in 1934 an agreement (see copy at , A* below) was reached with the Sultan of Muscat whereby in return for an annual payment of £500, the Sultan agreed to grant His Majesty’s Government exclusive rights to establish an aerodrome or aerodromes at that place. This agreement expires on the 24th October 1938. When, soon after the conclusion of the agreement, air services were increased, consideration was given to the question of making some increase in the annual payment for the facilities granted; and in 1936 the Sultan was offered a new agreement for seven years at an increased rental of £1,000 a year with retrospective effect from the 1st January 1935. He accepted the increased offer of £1,000 a year, but steadfastly refused to sign an agreement to that effect for more than two years. Article 17 of the agreement was accordingly altered to provide for the payment of £1,000 annually from the 1st January 1935 until October 1938 when the original agreement expires. The Sultan may have cause to regret his decision since it has now been decided ,for operational reasons to establish an aerodrome and sea-plane base permanently at Jiunri (situated about 40 miles to the west of Gwadur in territory belonging to the Khan of Kalat) to take the place of the existing facilities at Gwadur. During his recent visit to London, the Sultan was informed orally^by Sir Trenchard Powle that Imperial Airways were not fully satisfied with the natural facilities at Gwadur and may decide to move the aerodrome etc. , if a better place could be found elsewhere. At that/2. that time it was felt desirable not to say anything more definite until the necessary arrangements had been made with the Khan of Kalat. The Sultan expressed no surprise, but asked that the decision should be communicated to him as soon as possible. The present position is that the Khan of Kalat has agreed to provide the necessary facilities at Jiunri (though matters of detail such as rent and customs dues remain to be settled) and it is anticipated that the change-over will have been completed by the date on which the present agreement with the Sultan expires. The Government of India accordingly suggest that if His Majesty^ Government and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf see no objection, the latter should now arrange for the Sultan to be informed officially of the recent developments as soon as poss: after he reaches Bombay on the 30th May. When this has been done the Government of India propose to issu&lt; a press communique explaining the position. So far as we are concerned there is no objection to these arrangements. The Resident also sees no objection, and when replying to the Government of India it is proposed to endorse the Resident’s suggestion that he should convey to the Sultan an expression of the thanks of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India for the facilities hitherto accorded at Gwadur. Draft telegram submitted accordingly.this afternoon. The intention is to evacuate Gwadar completely, both as regards the Marine base and the land~ aerodrome. Imperial Airways have already issued instructions to the pilots of their flying boats to alight at Jiunri when necessary, and when the necessary organisation has been effected there,it will be possible to dispense entirely with Gwadar. I understand that this is the information which you wish to convey to the Sultan of Muscat. Yours sincerely. iJk J L * CL*-( AAs** ^^ Cc-d A-^ l^Tk ( - Cn Iv'-'V. i—, C* A.C.B.

I have noted the amendments which you suggest in the Minutes of the meeting held to discuss Behai and Gv/adur on 13th April. With regard to the proposed move from Gv/adur, every effort is being made to have Jiunri available for use before the expiry of the agreement with the Sultan of Muscat but various technical difficulties have to be overcome. As a result of your telephone conversation with Galpin shortly after the meeting, Tymms was asked by telegram to negotiate v/ith the Khan of Kalat and to obtain the best terms possible. A signal from Tymms to Galpin dated 28th April concluded v/ith the following v/ords: ’•Transfer of operations from Muscat to Indian territory involves certain political and administrative questions which are being examined. ” We shall keep you informed of further proceedings. Before sending you a formal request to negotiate a renewal of the agreement with the Sheikh of Debai we are awaiting from Imperial Airv/ays a schedule of their requirements. As soon as these have been obtained we shall let you have particulars of the facilities which it is necessary to obtain from the Sheikh. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J.H. RIDDQCH.

Dear Symon, Empire Air Mail Scheme . Facilities at G-wadur . With reference to your telephone conversation with Riddoch on the 19th and to the meeting in Ariel House on the 13th instant, on facilities at Bahai, we have now decided to establish an Aerodrome and Flying Boat Base permanently at Khor Jiunri ■fo Talce the place of the existing facilities at G-wadur. The exact time of transfer cannot yet he stated, hut it is hoped that Jiunri will he available before the monsoon begins, and it is at any rate anticipated that Gwadur may he wholly dispensed with before the expiry of the existing Agreement with the Sultan of Muscat on 25th October, 1938. I shall be glad if you will communicate this decision to the Sultan To guard against the possibility of unforeseen cir cumstances v/hich would necessitate the use of Gwadur for a short time after the Agreement terminates, it is desired that rela tions with the Sultan should remain as friendly as possible. It should, therefore, be emphasised that this decision has been arrived at purely for operational reasons and is not in any way connected with the Sultan’s contemplated demand for increased rent. The following information may assist you to substantiate this aspect. Although Gwadur has been in use for some seven months, doubts have for a long time been felt regarding its use during the monsoon. Its main disadvantages are its exposed position, the difficulty of landing passengers in rough weather, the shallows near the shore, the necessity of using both East and West Bays according to the seasons, and the distance (11 miles) A. C.B. Symon, Esq. , /of India Office, S.W. 1. I DEPARTMENT OF Cl VIL^AVI ATION. “AIR MINISTRY. i J . z. 2833 1938 4-7 ARIEL HOUSE. STRAND. LONDON, W.C.2. 21st April, 1938.of the Aerodrome from the Seaplane Base and from the mooring buoys to the shore. It is in fact feared that during the monsoon occasions would arise on which landing would be quite impossible. In October, 1937, a proposal to establish a base at Jiunri at the mouth of the River Dasht was mooted, but a later survey indicated that it had no advantages to offer over Gwadur. In February, 1938, the survey party, acting on local information, explored the possibility of utilising Khor Jiunri (hitherto uncharted ), and a detailed survey has confirmed that the site offers facilities much superior to those at Gwadur. The channels are suitable, and a barrier at the mouth of the Khor acts as a breakwater which should enable Jiunri to be used throughout the monsoon. The landing ground is only four miles from the Khor. It is believed that the Khan of Khalat looks with favour on the establishment of a base in his territory, but you may be able to offer some guidance in this respect. The following telegram was sent on the 14th instant to the Director of Civil Aviation in India:- ' ''Proposals agreed by Air Ministry and Imperial Airways we are anxious to get to Jiunri as early as possible. Sutherland is being fully instructed on details by Company. Please make necessary arrangement via Government of India with Khan of Khalat for occupation on best terms obtainable and inform'. x Yours sincerely,DRA^T Ilotes of a Meeting held in Room 406, Ariel House, on Wednesday 13th April 1938, at 3 p.m # , to discuss the question of the continued use of Dubai by Imperial Airways Limited, PKRSKNT : Mr. C.J.Galpin, D.S.O.

SIR TRENCHARD POWLE explained that there were serious objections to the continued use of Dubai by Imperial Airways. These were (a) the exorbitant terras which were being demanded by the Sheikh, and (b) defence considerations. In this latter connection a recent agitation had arisen against the deportation of two gun runners. If drastic action had been necessary there was the question to be considered of native reprisals against the flying boats. As the ©lighting area was situated behind the town, it was out of sight of the sea and there would be no means of any effective aid being rendered by a sloop in the event of the natives shooting at the flying boats, or rendering a landing impossible by anchoring dhows or other craft in the fairway. At Ras-el-Khaimah and Umm-al-Qawain, however, the lagoons could be protected by the guns of a sloop. In the circumstances SIR THENCHARD POWLE considered that it would be preferable if Imperial Airways could vacate Dubai for one of the other two places.mm » (a) Unm~a1-Oarcairu MR* CROSS remarked that he had ijersonally surveyed the three sites f both ft^om the air and on the ground* With regard to Umm-al-Qawain he was of the opinion that the site was not suitable for operation all the year round* At high tide the banks were covered and a flying boat coming Into land would have great difficulty in selecting a suitable stretch of water* He had examined the R*A*P* archives at Baghdad and had ascertained that the R.A.F. were not in favour of this alighting area* . He agreed with the suggestion by THE CHAIRMAN that it might be possible to employ marker buoys, in order to define the area, but he thought that a great deal of buoying would be required before such a method would be practicable* lie pointed out that dredging would assist, but explained that in that port of the world costs were definitely prohibitive, and, in addition, once dredging operations were started it would probably be necessary to keep on with them. THE CHAIRMAN observed that if Imperial Airways felt that it would be dangerous for their flying boats to operate at Umn-el~Q;;wain he did not feel it was practicable to consider that site any further. MR* BANKS stated that he was unable to comment on the Company’s contention regarding Umm-al-Qawain as he had not had any personal experience of the alighting areas on the Persian Gulf. (b) Pm s- el~Khaineh * In connection with Ras-el-Khairnah, MR* CROSS observed that the strong prevailing winds were at ri ht angles to the stretch of water. During his investigation of the R*A*P* records at Baghdad he load discovered a recommendation by W/Cdr. ’7eleh (as he then was) to abandon Ras-el-Khaimah and concentrate on Dubai. MR. CROSS stated that in his view it would be inadvisable to use Rns-el-Khaimah in preference to Dubai/3 Dubai* CDH. GALPIN supported this contention* G/CAPT* C0UYT01T remarked that it v/as the considered opinion of the Air Staff that Rac-el-£haimah v/as preferable from a technical and operational point of view* He explained that when Dubai had been used by a R.A*P. Squadron during a flight to Singapore, it had been because the wrong type of fuel had been stored at Ras-el-Khaimah. MR. CROSS pointed out that a very strong factor which made Dubai desirable was its proximity to Sharjah, where there existed building accommodation for staff and passengers, and also full wireless facilities. Any further capital expenditure was therefore not necessary; but if it were decided to use Ras-el-Khaimah it would be necessary to incur very considerable expenditure on the provision of suitable accommodation and adequate wireless equipment. In reply to the CHAIRMAN, MR. CROSS admitted that it might not be necessary to provide full wireless facilities and that wireless in the launch and the establishment of telegraphic communication with the station at Sharjah might prove sufficient. He pointed out, however, that landline communication could not be regarded as satisfactory in this region. MR. BANKS considered that these arrangements would provide adequate facilities for communications. He suggested the erection of a small building on the shore to house the operator. SIR TRENCHARD FOWLS stated that it would he necessary to erect a fortified building for passengers in the same way as at Sharjah. (c) Dubai . THE CHAIRMAN referred to the possibility of dhows being anchored In the fairway at Dubai, and inquired whether this could be avoided if a native policeman accompanied the launch. SIR TRENCHARD FOWLE explained that this depended upon the power of the Sheikh. There was always an opposition party and/and it wes they who generally were the cause of the trouble. S/LZ)R. ELY suggested that if on any ocorcion trouble arose at Dubai, it would be a simple ma ter for the Company’s ground staff to notify the aircraft in advance, and an emergency landing could then be effected at Ras-el-^hainah. Imperial Airways f representatives agreed that this v/as a practicable solution. SIR TREHCHARD POV/LE stated that he had no objection to this arrangement if it were considered that in the event of any disturbances arising at Dubai, the Company would be able to use Res— el—Khaimah in emergency during the period of the trouble. S/LDR. ELY pointed out that in the case of a continued emergency, the Company could slow down their services in order to avoid a night stop at Ras—el—Ehaimah. MR. CROSS agreed that this would be possible but observed that the time-tables would hove tc be completely revolutionised to provide for such a change. CDR. GALPIN stated that at some future tine it mi ;ht be possible to omit the Trucial Coast section from the Company’s itinerary. Ras-el-Khaimah could then be used as an emergency stop. In this connection MR. CROSS observed that all stations should be potential ni ht stops to ensure continued elasticity of the services in the event of any unforeseen delays. G/CAPT. CORYTON informed MR. CROSS that the R.A.P. would probably be prepared to permit Imperial Airways to store a supply of fuel et Ras-el-Khaimah. He would, however# coiraminicate with MR. CROSS on this point when he had a t Dubai and that they should be prepared to use Ras-el-Khaimah in emergency should the question of the safety of _thelr_ser vie eg at Dubai arise on any occasion . ascertained the position. The Meeting agreed that Imperial Airways should co 2. With regard to the agreement with the Sheikh of Dubai, SIR/5 . SIR TRKNCHARD PO' ; r LE thought that the Dlicikh would probebly agree to i^enew If sufficient Inducement ?/ere offered. In reply to HR. GALPfN he observed that he did not think it practicable to threaten to move to another site unless there was in fact some definite alternative alighting area which the Company were prepared to uoe. MR. CROSS pointed out that the payment of £1,000 per annum which the Sheikh wob demanding, in addition to approximately 4 * ,C400 per annum paid at present for services ^actually Rn.44o per would bring the landing fee to about £3 plus the Rs. 5 for month. each landing as already required under the present Agreement. This would in fact not amount to much more than was paid to certain other countries on the route. MR. HOW stated that from a financial point of view the advantage of Dubai v;as the common user of the existing facilities at Sharjah, and it was. In his opinion. Important to maintain this arrange’ent* If Ras~el~KhaIrtish were to be used, it would be necessary practically to duplicate the Sharjah facilities, which would be very costly to the Air Ministry, or the Company, or both. In addition, there was the question of the terms which could be obtained from the Sheikh of Raa-el- Khaimeh. He thought that it would be preferable from a financial point of view to make the best possible bargain for the use of Dubai. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that In the initial stages of negotiation the £400 should be assumed to be included in the £1,000 now demanded. IL was afgeed that the negotiation of a new agreement should be left to the Political Resident, on the best terms obtainable. 5 = MR. SYHQN Inquired as to a suitable term for the Agreement. CDR. GALPUT Indicated that the Company would prefer a long term agreement, and suggested a period of about 10 to 15 years. Mr. How thought that If a long term agreement woulV n6 T&gt;&gt; would result in a reduction of the costa it might he advisable; but it seemed that the matter depended jrimarily on Imperial Airways* view of the probably development of the services* MR* BAliKS pointed out that the pro ability of landplanes rei lacing flying boats in about five years time should be considered, and he suggested that five years should be the maximum period of the Agreement. The meet In,: a«;.eed t hat the i.e^o respect Of the Ar.reeapnt should oe baaed on a term of five years * ME* RIDDOCH suggested that provision should be made for the Agreement to bind the heirs and successors ox the present Sheikh. MB* SYi OH stated that this would be borne in mind in drawing up the agreement* C13R. GALiTK inquired whether it would be possible for the question of safeguarding passengers between Dubai and Sharjah to be incorporated in the Agreement* At present there was a written agreement on the matter, signed only by the Sheikh of Dubai, and the Company felt that the position should be made more secure, MR. SYMON pointed out that it would not be possible to refer to the question in the Du^ai Agreeme it, as it was a matter also concerning the Sheikh of Sharjah. Sib TRIfiXHARD FCVtLE stated that the questions would be safeguarded in the negotiations with the Sheikh. 3 # MR. SYMON stated that the Sultan of Muscat, who was at present in England, had expressed a desire to settle the arrangements regarding the renewal of the present Agreement for the use of Gwadur, which was due to expire in October next. The Sultan had pointed out that if he continued to give exemption from/Ml' ' Ml 1 I ' l|» 7. from duties on petrol he would require an increased rental. Mi. SYL10$ remarked that he understood that the Air Ministry were contemplating a move from Gwadar to Jiunri. If this would not take place until after October it would be necessary to make immediate arrangements with the Sultan for an extension of the Agreement. THE CHAIRMAN stated that operational difficulties made it necessary to leave Gwadar. A jround and air survey of Jiunri had been carried out and a detailed report was expected shortly# Mr. Banks remarked that if Imperial Airways were prepared to live under canvas, it would be poaai le to move to Jiunri before October# THE CHAIRMAi! suggested that the Agreement should be extended for a period of one year# MR# SYMOU pointed out that if this were decided, special terms would have to be proposed. He explained that it would be of no use to quote to the Sultan examples of the arrangements existing in British territories, e.g., Sudan or lalestine, as the Sultan had jointed out that he was ruler of an independent and foreign State and was only interested in the arrangements with other foreign countries. MR. SYMQH agreed with 1®. BARKS that in the event of a move to Jiunri it would be necessary to come to an arrangement with the Khan of Khalat, in whose State Jiunri was situated. THE CHAIHMAK undertook to examine the question of the Gwadar Agreement and to brief the India Office as soon as possible#Sultan of Muscat on 12th April His Highness informed me that one of the subjects which he would like to discuss on his return from Paris was the renewal of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement in respect of Gv/adur. His Highness indicated that if he was not allowed to charge customs duty on oil imported for the use of Imperial Airways he would require an increased rental. The present Agreement expires next October, and the question of renewing the Agreement is complicated by the fact that the Air Ministry are considering the use of J%unri as an alternative site. It seems unlikely i hov/ever that J«.unri can be made available by October, and it is probable that the Air Ministry will want the Agreement renewed for a period of one year. They have promised to prepare a brief for use in the discussions with the Sultan.COPY OF g.W. F.Z.2457/1938. 507981/36/0.0.1. Air Ministry, London, W.C.2. 31st March, 1938.

He was, however, persuaded to exempt oil and petrol from duty (by the drav/back system) and he also agreed that ’’Aircraft and soare parts therefor, aero engines, and spare parts therefor which are required for emergency repairs” should not be liable to duty* These concessions are embodied in Article 15 of the Civil Air Agreement# But it is quite clear that His Highness reserved the right to claim duty on 'general stores” imported by Imperial Airways, Ltd., and the Company have just confirmed that generally they pay duty on such items as furniture, refrigerators, paint, etc# In such circumstances it e^eema obvious that in the absence of any arrangement to the contrary the Sultan can legitimately claim duty on the marine equipment which Imperial Airways wish to import for use in connection with the Air Mail Service and it is for consideration whether we can reasonably expect him to grant exemption on such stores.r- - y 0 %; i i s.mmntn o JL ry Zj n, L Extract from Note of a on 17.11.37. between Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary, External Affairs Department, and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, at which the Political Agent, Muscat, was also present.

The Political Agent mentioned that he was anxious that the Sultan should give full authority to his representative during his long coming absence from his capital to authorise various projects contemplated by the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways at Gwadur in connection with the new services of flying boats to be inaugurated, so that if a request was made for various housing quarters to be erected, apparatus to be installed, and other essential work to be carried out during the Sultan’s absence when it would be impossible to get into touch with him, his Representative should have full authority to give the necessary permission. The Sultan promised that he would take steps to see that specific authority for this purpose was given to his Representative.Extract from Note of a discussion held on 17.11.37.

The Sultan complained that various aircraft apparatus was being sent to Gwadur on which customs duty, it was claimed, was not payable since it was the property of the Air Ministry. The articles consisting chiefly of motor launches, buoys, anchors, searchlights etc., and other apparatus required for the use of aircraft were used almost exclusively by Imperial Airways, and as this was a commercial company he did not see why these articles should be exempted from customs duty. The relevant clause of the Civil Air Agreement, the Sultan pointed out, made no mention of Air Ministry apparatus being exempt, but only that ofthe Royal Air Force and though he had been informed that these departments were one and the same he interpreted this clause as applying to articles for the exclusive use of the Royal Air Force. the Sultan had some cause for complaint, and suggested that the Sultan should write in to the Political Agent who would forward the representation to the proper authority.

J Ai rv/ay Terminus, Victoria Station, London, 3.W.I. 10th January, 1=&lt;38. Dear Mr. Burkett, In Mr. Dismore’s absence I am giving you the information asked for in your letter of 12th November last, reference 571849/36/C.0.1., on the question of exemption from auty on marine equipment imported into Gwauur for use in connection with the Empire Mail Scheme. It is regretted that so much delay has occurred since you wrote, but it has been necessary to refer the matter to our overseas offices, and in some cases even now the information is incomplete. In regard to your first query, we are informed that Customs duty was paid on importation of the tents used as passenger accommodation at Gwadur. The petrol pump, however, is the property of our Fuel Suppliers and we understand that they also are called upon to pay duty on equipment imported into Gwadur. Further points in connection v/ith Gwadur which may be of interest to you are that:- ^a) Generally, we pay duty on all general stores, such as furniture, refrigerators, paint, etc. (b) Although no payments have yet actually been made, duty is payable on marine equipment, and our people are becoming anxious lest they should be compelled to pay the duty in order to take delivery of the equipment. As it is, the Gwadur Customs now hold in custody the wheels for the control launch beaching trolley and a spare launch engine until such time as the duty is paid, v/hile the floodlight recently transferred from Basra to Gwadur, is, pending payment of duty, virtually in the custody of the Customs who, hov/ever, have permitted it to be kept in the floodlight house at the aerodrome where our representative, having arranged the matter unofficially, can have access to it when it is required. ■ AJ Am* (c) Our people in India have informed us that they are experiencing increasing concern because, contrary ^to their expectations as advised you in our letter of *25th August last, reference ARE/ML/752, no action has yet been taken to rescind the order to collect auty. Replying to your second query, the following is the practice which obtains in regard to paying Customs aues on equipment elsewhere (1) Alexandria ana all Egyptian Stations . Equipment items which are the property of the Air Ministry, such as launches, mooring buoys and other marine equipment, are exempted from paymentof duty but quay dues are paid at l/o ad valorem. (2) Sudan . Duties are paid on Air Ministry equipment at IQo ad valorem and are recoverable on the submission of a declaration to the effect that the items are the property of the Air Ministry and are imported for use in connection with the Empire Mail Scheme. (3) Palestine . Air Ministry equipment is exempted from payment of duty. (4) Iraq . No duties are payable on Air Ministry equipment. (5) Shar.jah and Bahrein . No duties are payable on Air Ministry equip ment . It is hoped that the foregoing will give you the information you require for communication to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. If, however, there is anything further you wish to know, you will no doubt immediately communicate with us.

Major question is whether Civil Air Agreement covers proposed Flying Boat services. Article 1 of Muscat Civil Air Agreement grants His Majesty’s Government the exclusive right to establish and maintain more than one aerodrome and ancillary services within Sultan’s territory. Definition of 'aerodrome- in Indian Aircraft Rules, 1920, is as follows: 'Aerodrome' means 'any definite ground or water area intended to be used and capable of being used for the landing or departure of aircraft,' and includes all ancillary services. This is expressly recognised in paragraph 4 of Sir Trenchard Fowle’s Express Letter Hfo .914-3 of the 30th November 1935, and there can be no question of a claim for further compensation tor the use of Gwadur harbour as &amp; landing place for Flying Boats.3* Compensation for additional services ot Imperial Airw&amp;ys ias already been granted and accepted by tne Sultan by means of additional payment of £ 1000/- per annum and in view of wnat is stated above would include Flying Boat services. 4. Only possible claim wiiicn mignt arise and wnicn could be supported would be in connection witn ancillary services in connection witft new Flying Boat base at Gwadur. Tnis point should not be taKen up until and unless it arises, but should it arise the principles on which it would fall to be settled are stated in paragraph 3 of Sir Trencnard Fowle’s Sxpresa Letter .bio.914-S of the 30th November 1930 (see also his telegram No.280 of the 28th February 1937). 5. Sultan should therefore be informed (a) that he has already received compensation for increased services which includes Flying Boats (b) that under his Agreement no additional compensa tion is due for establishment of second aerodraue on water and (c) that question of payment for ancillary services, if any, in connection with new aerodrome would be considered if and when it arises. sd. &lt;D.X.

We desire to secure exemption from customs duty for marine aircraft imported into G-wadur for use in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme, as has been done in the case of equipment for the wireless station there. As you know, the existing agreement with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman contains no provision for the exemption from duty of marine equipment as at the time it was signed there v/as no question of using flying boats instead of landplanes. We should be glad, therefore, if the Political Resident could be requested to take this matter up with the Sultan at as early a date as possible with a view to securing this exemption, which is v/ithin the spirit of the existing agreement.

(ii) The aircraft shall not use as a place of landing or departure within the territories of Muscat and Oman any place other than the aerodromes at Gwadur and Shinas, ana the published conaitions governing the use of the said aerodromes shall be observed. (iii) This authorisation or a certified true copy of it shall be carried in the aircx-alt and be produced on demand for the inspection of any authorised person.2 #itn regard to (to)» I'iie Sultant* despite mucxi argu* merit, said tnat ne was not prepared to abolisn tne present system of Customs rebate, and I enclose a copy of a letter Mo*82/69-C, dated tne 23rd June 1937, from Major *atts to tne Sultan and tne latter’s reply of tne same date confirming tnis point. j^rom tne Sultan’s point of view tne following nas to be remembered. (i) Fuel at (iwadur is imported in bulk by tne Anglo- Iranian Oil Company for tne use not only of tne Imperial Airways but for tnat of K.L.jmu, Air krance and casual fliers. If tne sultan agreed not to cnarge customs duty on entry a separate account would nave to be made up at tne end of^say eacn quarter of tne fuel uplifted by tne Imperial Airways, wnicn would nave to be deducted from tne total amount imported, and duty cnarged on tne balance. Before tnese accounts were made and cnecked considerable delay would elapse and in tne meantime tne Sultan would nave to wait for tne duty on all fuel imported. under tne present system duty is cnarged on all fuel on entry and Imperial Airways subsequently get tneir rebate. In otner words it is Imperial Airways wno nave to wait for tneir money instead of tne Sultan, a system wnicn tne latter naturally prefers. (ii) It is true tnat at Bahrain tne Bahrain Government does not charge customs dues on fuel imported for Imperial Airways but tnere, unlike at uwadur, tne fuel /m£~ fuel ia used solely oy Imperial Airways, so no question of delay over accounts is experienced, (ill) Wiile at Bahrain tne Royal Air i’orce pay duty on tneir fuel, in muscat territory tney do not. 5. tfitn regard to (c). Major watts nas reported tnat tne sultan nas since paid tne balance of £ Sbl.l.O, wnicn or Watts nad made over to tne Imperial Airways, Karacni. [ If delay in tne payment to ws Imperial Airways oi customs drawback occurs in future, tne advisability of deducting tne amounts due from tne rental payable to tne sultan mignt be considered. 6. I am instructing Major watts to excnange letters witn tne sultan witn reference to Article 17 of tne ••Heads of Agreement* of tne Civil Air Agreement putting into fnrce tne revised terms agreed upon. i*nis action can conveniently be taken on tne return of tne sultan oi muscat irom nis noliday in Kasnmir and of Major Watts from recess. ad* T.C.S’owle.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to the correspondence ending with India Office letter of the 18th May, No.P.Z.3182/1937, on the subject of the revision of the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement. 2. As the Secretary of State for India is aware, steps are being taken to define the area of the Civil Aerodrome at Muharraq. A map showing, in detail, the boundaries of the aerodrome will be furnished as soon as it is available. 3. In the meantime, it seems desirable that the formal consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein should be obtained to the operation of Imperial Airways' contemplated flying- boat services via Bahrein with landings on the water near Manama. In this connection, I am to enclose a map indicating the location of the proposed flying-boat base and alighting area. 4. The use of an alighting area on the water near Manama will entail a revision of the 'Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft for the Territory of Bahrein, and Conditions governing the use of the Aerodrome at Muharraq approved by His Excellency the Sheikh Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah, C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrein' which permit of landings by aircraft at Muharraq only. The amendments necessary would seem to be as follows (a) Section I .- The Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft . (i) Paragraph 4. Delete the words 'Aerodrome at Muharraq' and substitute the words 'the land aerodrome at Muharraq, or the water aerodrome at Manama.” (ii) Paragraph 11. Delete the words 'Muharraq Aerodrome' and substitute the words 'the Aerodromes at Muharraq and Manama.' (b) Section II - Conditions governing the use of the Aerodrome at Muharraq . (i) Cross heading - Delete the words 'Aerodrome at Muharraq' and substitute the words 'Aerodrome at Muharraq and Manama.' (ii) Paragraph 1. Delete the words 'Muharraq Aerodrome' and substitute the words 'The Aerodromes at Muharraq and Manama.' (c) Appendix . 'Form of Special Authorisation for aircraft to land in Muharraq and fly over Bahrein.' The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, London, S.¥.l. (D/(i) Cross heading - After the word 'Muharraq' insert the words 'or Manama.' (ii) Paragraph 2 (ii) - After the word 'Muharraq' insert the words 'in the case of landplanes, or the aerodrome at Manama in the case of seaplanes.' 5. I am now to ask that, subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland, the Political Pesident in the Persian Gulf may be instructed to approach the Sheikh with a view to obtaining his formal consent to the operation of Imperial Airways’ flying-boat services via Bahrein, and approval of the amendment of the local Air Navigation Regulations. 6. Lord Swinton would suggest that the Marquess of Zetland may also wish to consider whether any approach to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman is desirable with reference to the proposed operation of flying-boat services over nis territories with landings at Gwadar. No amendment o. the local air navigation regulations seems to be required if the term 'Gwadar Aerodrome' can be interpreted as including flying boat bases as well as the land aerodrome. 7. Lord Swinton would propose that the detailed arrangements for facilities for the flying boat services at Manama and Gwadar should be left for settlanent locally. He is given to understand that Imperial Airways have already made the necessary arrangements there in respect o^ the preliminary survey flights. I am , etc. , (Sd.) A.H.Self.Tel. No.: WHITEHALL 7171.

Major &lt;Yatts, who was able to visit the Sultan at Dhofar while on the recent Royal Air Force reconnaissance to that p&amp;rt of the world, on which I have reported separately, writes as foil ws. 3. The Sultan has agreed in writing to accept the offer of £ 1000/- a year for the increased use of the aerodrome but is not willing to sign an agreement to that effect for more than two years.

In spite of Major Watts’ arguments the Sultan declared that he preferred to adhere to the present system of customs drawback. The objection to this is contained in paragraph 7 of Air Ministry letter No.S.32956/11/DDCA dated the 31st August 1935 to the India Office. Financially there is no difference between the drawback system and the waiving of customs dues, but I will take the matter up with the Sultan when I visit Muscat in April: Major yatts reports that the Sultan is returning from Dhofar some time in February. Should the Sultan still prove obdurate I think we will have to concede t&amp;is point. 5. With reference to paragraph 5 of your letter No.P.Z. 2550/36. Major Watts reports that a large portion of his interview with the Sultan at Dhofar was taken up by endeavour ing to persuade him of the moral and legal obligations on him to pay back the amounts received by way of customs duty. Finally, the Sultan, after much quibbling, gave a cheque for £ 600/- on account stating that he would go into the matter in detail when he returned to Muscat. Major ;/atts has sent this cheque to Imperial Airways Head Office in India at Karachi. Doubtless the Sultan in taking up his obstructive attitude bn this point has been influenced by the fact that the present agreement is not a particularly good bargain from his point of view. //hen he has made a new agreement he will doubtless be more ready to refund the drawbacks regularly, but if not I propose that His Majesty’s Government should /-3- should deduct whatever is owing to Imperisil Airways under this head from the subsidy which they will be paying the Sultan# This will save this Residency the time and trouble spent in extracting these refunds* sd.

The proposals of the Air Ministry, in which two alternative methods of making an increased payment to the Rulers of Bahrein and Muscat are put forward, will be found at P.Z.2435/36.

With regard to Kuwait , my views after discussion with de Gaury are as follows: The Air Ministry - vide paragraph 10 of their letter - do not consider that any reason exists for an increase in the annual payment of a 500 to the Ruler since Kuwait is not scheduled as a regular stopping place under the Empire Air Mail Scheme and it will only be used on special occasions or in emergency. Kuwait under the present scheme is already scheduled as a non-regular stopping place but in spite of this Imperial Airways’ planes have made fairly frequent stops. It may be that under the Empire Air Mail Scheme, in spite of the fact that Kuwait will not be a regular stopping place. Imperial Airways with their 5 day a week service will continue to stop on the same average per service. Experience during 1937 will show whether this occurs or not, and if it does, and the Shaikh in consequence applies for an increase of his present 'annual rental' of t 500, the matter could be taken up when his present Agreement is due for renewal in May With regard to Bahrain and Mu scat. I am of opinion that either of the Air Ministry’s proposals are fair. As far as negotiations with these Rulers is concerned I propose trying Air to / M.J.Clauson Esquire, The India Office, Londonto induce them to choose either (a) or (t&gt;), merely pointing out the pros and cons of each alternative. 4. With regard to the point mentioned in your paragraph 3, that the Sultan of Muscat should agree to non-payment of customs duty in the first instance. Major Watts will take this point up with the Sultan when he approaches him as to the Air Ministry’s alternatives. 5. The matter mentioned in your paragraph 5 is being dealt with separately. 6. On receipt of a further communication from His Majesty’s Government 1 will instruct the Political Agents Bahrain and Muscat to approach their respective Rulers on the lines of my paragraph 3 above, and, for Muscat, also of my paragraph 4 above.

I now enclose a copy of a letter from the Air Ministry upon which we shall be glad to receive your views. 2. The figures attached to the Air Ministry letter show clearly the value of the exemptions from petrol and oil duties, and we now at last have all the cards on the table. You will see that if the increased payments to the Rulers were strictly based on the estimated increase in consumption, they would be A larger than those now proposed. On the other hand we feel that there is considerable force in the argument(which the Air Ministry very strongly urged in inter-departmental discussion) that were to observe the now recognised international practice of granting drawback, their claims to compensation would disappear. We suggest, therefore, that the present proposals put forward by the Air Ministry, which constitute a substantial advance on their previous proposals,/proposals, are worth sympathetic consideration and that it is probably not too muchto expect the rulers to tie themselves down for 7 years in return for the financial advantages which they would derive. 3. The financial benefits which will accrue to the rulers under each of the two alternatives suggested by the Air Ministry seem to be nicely balanced. It seems unlikely that the endurance ot aeroplanes will increase to such an extent within the next 7 years that it will be possible to dispense with the present stopping places, so it appears that alternative (b) is almost as safe an arrangement as alternative (a). In either case it would be necessary to revise articles 16 and 17 of the Civil Air Agreements as well as article 15 in the case of Muscat, as it is clearly / essential that the Sultan of Muscat should agree to non-payment of customs duty in the first instance. The choice between the two alternatives appears, therefore, primarily to depend upon which will be the easier to negotiate. (b) might from this point of view be preferable, as it is based on a simple and logical principle; moreover the figure of £150 per weekly flight compares favourably with the present actual value of the exemption at Bahrein (£230 for 2 flights) and appears to be exactly the value/Draft Paper.

As you will see Treasury authority has to be obtained before the rulers can be approached, so we should b« grateful for your comments as soon as possible. 5.

Sir, 2435 ! 19 o 6 J AIR MINISTRY, LONDON, W.C.2. April, 1936 I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to your letter of the 23rd December last, p.2.8744/35, regarding the question of the revision of the Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat Civil Air Agreements, to subsequent semi-official corres pondence, and to the meeting between representatives of the India Office and Air Ministry on the 13th ultimo. Y/hile, as stated in this Department's letter of the 31st . August last, S.32906/11/D.D.C.A., Lord Swinton agrees that in view of the increased use of the landing grounds and the still further use which will be made under the Empire Air Mail scheme, some increase in the annual payments to the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat is justified, he is very reluctant to agree that such increase should De directly relaxed to the quantities of oil fuel imported into these states for the purpose of refuelling the f machines. I am to enclose a copy of a statement furnished by Imperial Airways shewing the present annual imports of petrol and oil and the duty charged,together with estimates of the corresponding figures when the Empire Air Mail Scheme is in operation. The Company point out that the figures are given with some reserve as they understand that further debits are to be received for the 6 months ended 30th September, 1935, suppliers having charged incorrect amounts. It is now a recognised international practice to grant exemption from Customs or other duties in respect of fuel and oil taken on board for the purpose of operating machines to places outside the territory in which the stock is maintained, and where duty has already been paid, a Customs drawback is granted in respect of any quantities of oil and petrol supplied to aircraft for use in such circumstances. If, therefore the rulers of these two states conformed to international practice , the complaint as to the apparent loss of customs revenue owing to the operation of the exemption clause in the civil air agreements, would disappear. Lord Swinton also desires to point out that, apart from the advantages which will accrue to the territories by the establishment of the civil air routes, the continued maintenance of such a route through these territories facilitates the passage of military aircraft in emergency, which is an essential requirement if His Majesty's Covernment are to be enabled to come to the assistance of these rulers in time of emergency. The Under-Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, S.W.l. 11 APR 1936 INL.. /in•In^theae circumstances Lord Swinton would prefer to base the increased rentals at Bahrein and Gwadar on the general increase in use by Imperial Airways of the facilities provided and would be prepared to seek Treasury authority for either of the following alternatives, (a) Lew Agreements for 7 years at an increased rental of £1,000 a year with retrospective effect to the date when the service was duplicated, viz: 1st January, 1935, covering the privileges enumerated under 'A” and ’’B” of . the Political Resident*s Express Letter 894/S of 27th Lovember last, or (b) to revise the existing agreements to provide for their continuance for a further period of 7 years with an increased payment of £150 a year in respect of each additional service undertaken by Imperial Airways over and above the first service covered by the payment of £500 a year under the original agreement. Resident in the Persian Gulf should be informed of the fore going views and be asked to consider the possibility of negotiating agreements with the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat on one or other of the bases suggested,in substitution for the existing agreements which are not due to expire until the 6th June 1938 and 25th October, 1938, respectively. Colonel Fowle will no doubt point out to the rulers concerned that under the first alternative they would receive a guaranteed annual amount, irrespective of the number of services in operation, whilst under the latter arrange ment, there is a possibility of variation in the amounts payable, as in the event of an improvement in the endurance of machines employed on this route, landings at one of the intermediate stopping places might be rendered unnecessary. It is assumed that in view of the increased payments offered under either alternative, the Sultan of Muscat would agree to non-payment of Customs duty in the first instance, instead of the present unfortunate system of a quarterly refund. landing ground is not scheduled as a regular stopping place under the Empire Air Mail Scheme and it will only be used on special occasions or in emergency. Lord swinton does not consider, therefore, that any reason exists for an increase in the annual payment of £500 to the ruler. A copy of a letter dated 5th March, 1936, which has been received from Imperial Airways Ltd. with regard to the difficulty which is being experienced by the Company in obtaining refund of duty on petrol and oil uplifted at Gwadar from 26th October, 1934, to 31st December, 1935, is also attached, and I am to request that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may be asked to take such action as is possible with a view to obtaining the refund of duties in accordance with the Civil Air Agreement.

Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat Civil Air Agreements 74 r*L Proposal that the Rulers of these States should he compensated for the customs exemptions which they grant in respect of fuel imported for the use of Imperial Airways. Please see the papers at P.Z. 5028/35, the Air Ministry letter at P.Z. 6228/35, Colonel Powle's note, flagged 'A' and the Political Resident's Express Letter below. Copies of the Civil Air Agreements in question have been placed at the bottom of the file. The facilities for which His Majesty's Government make their annual payment of £500 are conveniently summarised in the second paragraph of the Political Resident's Express Letter below. The Agreements were concluded at a time when Imperial Airways ran a weekly service. At the present moment this service has been duplicated, and in 1937, when the Empire air mails scheme comes into force, there will be five services a week. As a result, the exemptions from landing fees and from the payment of customs duty on fuel have already acquired a much enhanced financial value, which will be further increased in 1937. In fairness to the Rulers we thought it was desirable to re-examine the financial clauses of the various Agreements - see India Office letter at P.Z.5028. The Air Ministry concur in this view - see para. 2 of their letter at P.Z. 6228. But opinions differ as to the form and amount of the compensation which should be paid to the Rulers. Colonel Fowle favours making a payment in direct2. ■ uJaa^ «L ClV't ^ - r- (i /&gt; 17$. relation to the customs duty paid on the fuel imported. This seems to he the simplest arrangement and the fairest to the Sheikhs. The Air Ministry are, however, opposed to this scheme and wish to limit the payment to £250 per annum. This figure ignores purposely the great increase of fuel which will be imported when the five services a week are instituted. I think we should resist this proposal and insist upon some form of payment which will increase as the quantity of fuel imported increases. This can be done either by adopting Colonel Fowle's proposal as above, or by making a lump sum payment calculated on a sliding scale. The Air Ministry will probably resist this and we shall probably have to make some concession, but we might write along these lines to begin with. A possible compromise has been suggested by Mr. Clauson, in his note of 31st July at P.Z.5028, whilst Colonel Fowle in his note has also suggested a compromise, which I obscure, but perhaps our future tactics need not be discussed until we get the Air Ministry’s reply to the draft suggested below. It also seems premature at this stage to consider the actual alterations which will have to be made in the Civil Air Agreements. At the present moment the Sultan of Muscat collects the customs duty on fuel imported and refunds that portion of it which is used by Imperial Airways. Colonel Fowle thinks that he will be able to alter this procedure and bring it into line with that proposed in Bahrein and Koweit, i.e. that the Rulers do not collect customs duty but are refunded by His Majesty’s Government. It is therefore simpler in writing to the Air Ministry to treat all three States on the same footing. 't •iDraft Paper. The Secretary, Air Ministry, W.C.2. 2 4 DEC 1935 Copy to I?*0.

Sir, 2 3 DEC1M5 I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to Air Ministry letter of 31st August, No. S.329562/D.D.C.Aj regarding the Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat Civil Air Agreements. 2. The Marquess of Zetland &gt;e—sleasec v j W notejthat Lord Swinton concurs in his view regarding the desirability of revising the financial provisions of these Agreements; hut as regards the form which this revision should take he would invite attention to the political Resident’s Express Letter of 27th November, 1935, No.894-S/1935 ^copy of which was forwarded to the Air Ministry under 1.0. printed letter of 9th December, No .P.Z . 8744/35). ? The-MarTSe^~TTf Zetland agrees generally with the views expressed by Colonel Fowle; in particular he feels strongly that the compensatory payment should bear a close relation to the amount of duty which the Rulers actually surrender, and should not be limited to an arbitrary figure such as £250 which can hardly fail to be regarded by the Rulers as quite inadequate when the Empire Air Mail service is instituted. He is therefore inclined to favour Colonel Powle’s °irst suggestion, i.e. that the sum paid annually to the Rulers should/ 3938 5000 7.35should be equal to a 5 per cent, cus.toms duty paid on the actual amount of fuel imported in that year. /Jh. If, however, this proposal is unacceptable to the Air Council on account of the unfortunate repercussions which it mi^ht have on negotiations in respect of other territories in the Middle East, His Lordship would readily consider some arrangement whereby a lump sum would be paid annually to the Rulers, which would have no overt connection with the exemption from duty, though in fact based on the amount of fuel consumed. A Existing figures for the importation of fuel for the use of Imperial Airways Iajo '}&lt;rvd(A~ to td* Aa QmmcaK would ne doubt serve as a basis ^or calculating this sum, v/hich would increase in proportion to the amount of fuel actually imported. For instance, a sura representing roughly the value ofthe /&gt;H r‘r'- present exemption would be appropriate until the commencement of the Empire Air Mail, and a proportionately increased sum thereafter. J As Colonel Fowle foresees no difficulty in bringing the existing procedure in Muscat into uniformity with the procedure proposed for Bahrein and Koweit, Hi fr-Lorrishi-ft has assumed in this letter that his proposals would apply to all three States. His/, .4 Department '( 7 ' 6 , His Lordship does not propose at this stage to suggest the actual alterations to Clauses 15 and 16 of the Koweit and Bahrein and Clauses 15 and 17 of the Muscat Heads of Agreement, which it would be necessary to make in order to give effect to his proposals. But h« thin-ka there would be no difficulty in doing this once agreement has been reached 1 on the form and amount of the payment which is to be made. I am therefore to enquire whether the Air Council are prepared to reconsider* the matter v/ith a view to achieving an early settlement ■£ug^her term of^ vmy , fl rg on the general lines suggested above, the details of which can be settled by inter-departmental discussion. h cJjv { fj u iUA/l tTfa fi o . 0') i, Q, ’(TALTOH. g IWOEXEB &amp; CONFIDENTIAL* GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

The present sum of £.500 per annum (loosely termed ■\ 'annual rental') paid by Hie Majesty's Government to the Rulers of Kuwait, Bahrain, and Muscat under the Civil Air Agreements is in consideration of the following privileg«=a C corded by them to His Majesty^ Government s- A. (1) The use of the ground occupied by the aerodromes, ( 2 ) the ggclusive right to establish and maintain aerodromes and ancillary services (including w/T), (3) eSch^vices! f ° r the USe ° f SUch a e r ^omes and (4) w^? ti 0 n T,/S° m the customs duty on £raft fnd « a PParatus and spare parts and 0 n air- craft and spare parts, and (Signature) B* / S. 14 . M FP—1013S&amp;P—(M-1323) —30-10-33 -10,COO. ( Designation)- 2 - B. Exemption from the payment of customs duty on petrol and oil imported for the use of Imperial Airways. 3. I had pointed out in paragraph 8 of my Express Letter N0.459-S, dated the 2nd July 1935, that at the time the Civil Air Agreements were concluded it was not appreciated that the monetary value of these privileges, both in respect of A (especially A (3)) and of B, would rise so rapidly in consc ience of the duplication of the air mail service at the commencement of this year and its proposed further expansion, which it is now planned should extend to a service of 5 days a week in 1937* I had therefore suggested that it should be accepted as a principle that the sum of £.500 paid at present to the Rulers should be regarded only as consideration for the privileges under A, and that the Civil Air Agreements should be amended so as to provide for the payment of customs duty on all petrol and oil imported for the use of Imperial Airways. 4. It is now generally agreed that the Rulers in question have a clear case in equity for a re-examination of the effect ot‘ the existing Civil Air Agreements (vide paragraph 2 of Air Ministry 3.etter No.S.32956 II/i).D.C.A., dated the 31st August 1935). The Air Ministry, however, are averse from making a concession in the form suggested by me, i.e. payment of customs duty, as it would be difficult to avoid continuing it 0 n the same basis in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme, and have suggested (vide paragraph 5 of their letter quoted above) that privilege B should be compensated for by an annual payment of £.250 to each Ruler in addition to the annual payment of £.500 for the privileges accorded under A, it being made clear that /-3- that the additional payment would cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 and 0 nwards. 5. I am still of opinion that the simplest and most satisfactory way to deal with B is for customs duty to be paid on the actual amount imported. If, however, the objections to this proposal on the part of the Air Ministry are very strong, the only alternative is to fix a lump sum to be paid annually in lieu of customs duty. But in equity to the Rulers this sum should have some relation to the actual amount of duty the Ruler surrenders. I do not know, for instance, on what basis the Air Ministry suggested the sum of £.250. When the lump sum of £.500 to cover both A and B was fixed the service had only recently been transferred to the Arab route, and it was difficult to arrive at any reliable data. The service has now been running on the Arab Coast for over three years and figures of the importation of fuel for aircraft on the basis of a weekly service can doubt less be supplied by Imperial Airways. If this consumption is multiplied by five this would give a rough approximation of the fuel consumption when the service is expanded to its maximum, i.e. at five services a week, in 1937. The customs duty on fuel at Kuwait and Bahrain is 5^, that at Muscat is 10;a, but in order to bring the Sultan of Muscat into line with the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain the duty at Muscat may be regarded as being 5# for the purposes of assessing the annual payment under B (vide paragraph 9 of my Express Letter quoted above). With these factors as a basis it should be possible to arrive at a lump sum which would not only be fair to the Ruler, but would be based on a principle which would be /be readily understood by him. 6 . The present Civil Air Agreements are due to expire in 1938. I recommend that the system proposed in my preceding paragraph should be applied as follows. The financial clause of the Civil Air Agreement should be modified so that the sum of £.500 paid at present for A and B is allocated to A only from the date on which Imperial Airways service was duplicated, i.e. 1st January of this year. Similarly, the sum that is finally fixed for B should be allocated for that purpose from the same date, the actual sum paid to be o n a sliding scale corresponding with the increases of services. 7 . I have for the sake of clearness considered the allocation of these sums under the separate headings of A and B. If, however, it is not desired from the point of view of the Air Ministry to draw attention to the fact that a separate sum is actually being taid on account of B, doubtless the revised financial clause could be so worded as to include payments under both heads in one figure. 8 . With reference to paragraph 7 of the Air Ministry letter quoted above* If the proposal in my paragraphs 5 and 6 above is adopted I think it would be possible to induce the Sultan of Muscat to agree to non-payment of customs duty in the first instance instead of the present system of a refund. 9* It is, of course, not intended that the payment for B proposed in my paragraphs 5 and 6 above should cover customs duty on fuel and oil imported by Imperial Airways for the use of aircraft other than their own, the question of which is treated /treated separately under the Agreement® 10 . In conclusion I must point out that the presumption in paragraph 6 of the Air Ministry letter quoted above is not likely to be borne out by facts* The Rulers in question are already becoming concerned at the present increase of the Imperial Airways Services so far as it affects the financial terms of their Agreements, and will certainly prove difficult when it comes to an agreement covering a further increase in these services unless they receive what they consider to be adequate compensation. sd.

I think the Batch eo4 Fre eh Governmente ^il^ht reeeorukbljr recent their compeniee receiving this infor^etion through laperiel ^irwao'e before it wee officiell/ comoanlcetel to the^a through the oiploaetic chfi kneX ia reply to their official enquiries. I as eenai *g e copy of thi* letter to Cleueon.f Mr.Clauson, This subject is complicated Ifea* perhaps ~fons K q_. art might be illustrated as follows. Say 100 33?% f of r petrol and oil is imported into Bahrein and Koweit of which (a) 50 is for Imperial Airways (b) 50 for foreign aircraft. (No foreign aircraft of course use the Arabian route at present). The Rulers do not collect duty on either (a) or (b), but the duty on (b) is refunded to them by H.M.G. 2. Similarly, suppose the same amount of oil is imported at Muscat in the same proportions for (a) and (b) Ruler collects duty on (a) but refunds it a ^ mio-rt. pv! v to H.M.G. ; that on (b ) is refunded to him pay the three Rulers concerned £500 per annum which includes (l) the rent of the aerodrome 3. In addition to the refund on (b), H.M.G. ( 2 ) landing fees (3) duty under (a). In this connection the statement in para.3 of the Air Ministry 1 s letter, which seems to imply that the £500 only covers ( 1 ), i 3 not correct.2. 4. If the proposal in para. 8 of my express letter of 2nd July is accepted, then the £500 will cover (1) /'''N and (2), while (3) will be compensated for by H.M.G. according to the amount involved. 5. I do not think that this suggestion is in any way too generous. Something must be allowed for (1), and (2) on the present bi-weekly service of Imperial Airways comes to £400 per annum (see para .8 of my letter). r 1 1 -&gt; 6 . It seems to me therefore that the sum proposed by the Air Ministry in para. 5 of their letter of 31st August is definitely belov; the mark, more especially as they suggest that this sum should 'cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 onwards.'. 7. I appreciate the Air Ministry’s point of view (paras.3 and 4 of their letter) as to the possible repercussions on the Governments of Iraq, Palestine and Egypt in connection with the Empire mail scheme. These (X &lt;LCec. 5 are, however, outside my sphere. All I am concerned with are the Gulf Sheikhs, and I think it essential that we should avoid giving them any impression that they are not getting a square deal from us.3. 8 . Moreover the presumption in para .6 of the Air Ministry’s letter that there would be no difficulty in negotiating fresh agreements under their proposal is a large one. The rulers in question are already becoming somewhat concerned at the present increase of the Imperial Airways Services in so far as it affects the financial terms of their agreements^ and will certainly prove sticky when it comes to doubling these services without (what they consider to be) adequate compensation. 9. The following is a tentative suggestion. That we should fight the Air Ministry for £500 to cover ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) (para.3 above) with ( 3 ) to be compensated for in full settlement, this to take effect from the date of the doubling of the Imperial Airways services to the expiry of the present agreement when the question can be taken up again. The Air Ministry vill doubtless resist this tooth and nail, and we might eventually gracefully concede the point, and say we would do our best to induce the Sheikhs to conclude a perpetual agreement provided that the Air Ministry would provide the £500 per annum. This is, of course, a 3 a. what some people call bargaining” (and whatV y other people call 'comprcmiEe ,, ) , but this is a hard V o L&lt;^a.±- world and such'methods are often effective. 10. Colonel Loch will doubtless be asked his opinion on the whole question,as on the point raised in the enclosure to the Air Ministry’s letter.

I am directed 'by the Secretary of State for Air. to refer to India Office letter of the 2nd August, No.P.Z. 5028 / 35 , in regard to the exemption from Customs duty of petrol and oil imported into Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit for the use of Imperial Airways Ltd. 2. I am to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India that Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lis ter concurs in the view that there is a case for re-examining the effect of^tlivil Air Agreements with the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit. 3 . It seems to Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, however, that if the concession proposed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is made in the form suggested by him, it will be extremely difficult to avoid continuing it on the same basis in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme. This would of course involve much larger payments than those now in question. With five services a week instead of two, and having regard to the heavier type of aircraft to be used, the liability would be trebled, and would thus in each case amount to per annum in addition to the annaal rental of £500 paid to each of the three Rulers. A. It is not considered that this Department should be committed to payment of more than £250 a year in each case, especially having regard to the pressure which is being appliedto the Governments of Iraq, Palestine and Egypt to give remission in full in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme. 5 . It is suggested therefore that, in all three cases, petrol and oil should be exempted from Customs and other duties, a payment being made not exceeding £250 per annum to each Ruler, in part compensation, although it should be clearly provided that payment will be the maximum whatever the actual consumption of petrol and oil may be. It seems essential to make it clear that the agreement will cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 onwards. 6 . Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister presumes that if this suggestion commends itself to Lord Zetland there would be no difficulty in securing an amendment of the current Civil Air Agreements or, alternatively, in negotiating fresh agreements, say, for a period of five years from 1st January 193 b * 7 . It seems preferable that a similar arrangement for the payment of this ’’compensation” should, if possible, be made in all three cases. The present procedure in Muscat, under which the Sultan is called upon to make a substantial disbursement annually, tends to focus his discontent.

This subject is slightly complicated and perhaps might he illustrated as follows. Say 100 tons per annum of petrol and oil is imported into Bahrein and Koweit of which (a) 50 is for Imperial Airways; (b) 50 for foreign aircraft. (No foreign aircraft of course use the Arabian route at present). The Rulers do not collect duty on either (a) or (b), but the duty on (b) is refunded to them by H.M.G. 2. similarly, suppose the same amount of oil is imported at Muscat in the same proportions for (a) and (b). The Ruler collects duty on (a) but refunds it quarterly to H.M.G.; that on (b) is refunded to him by H.M.G* 3. In addition to the refund on (b), H.M.G. pay the three Rulers concerned £500 per annum which includes (1) the rent of the aerodrome (2) landing fees (3) duty unaer (a). In this connection the statement in paragraph 3 of the Air Ministry's letter, which seems to imply that the £500 only covers (1), is not correct. 4. if the proposal in paragraph 8 of my express letter of 2nd July is accepted, then the £500 will cover (1) and (2), while (3) will be compensated for by H.M.G. accordingto the amount involved. 5. I do not think that this suggestion is in any way too generous. Something must be allowed for (1) and (2) on the present bi-weekly service of Imperial Airways comes to £400 per annum (see paragraph 8 of my letter). 6. It seems to me therefore that the sum - £250 - proposed by the Air Ministry in paragraph 5 of their letter/•4 0 - 2 - letter of 31st August is definitely below the mark^ore especially as they suggest that this sum should “cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 onwards', 7. I appreciate the Air Ministry’s point of view (paragraphs 3 ana 4 of their letter)as to the possible repercussions on the Governments of Iraq, Palestine and Egypt in connection with the Empire mail scheme. These areas are, however, outside iqy sphere. All I am concerned with are the Gulf Sheikhs, and I think it essential that we shoula avoid giving them any impression that they are not getting a square deal from us. 8. Moreover the presumption in paragraph 6 of the Air Ministry’s letter that there would be no difficulty in negotiating fresh agreements under their proposal is a large onei The rulers in question are already becoming somewhat concerned at the present increase of the Imperial Airways Services in so far as it affects the financial terms of their agreements, and will certainly prove sticky when it comes to doubling these services without (what they consider to be) adequate compensation. 9. The following is a tentative suggestion. That we should fight the Air Ministry for £500 to cover (1) and (2) (paragraph 3 above) with (3) to be compensated for in lull settlement, this to take effect from the date of the doubling of the Imperial Airways services to the expiry of the present agreement when the question can be taken up again. The Air Ministry will aoubtless resist this tooth ahd nail, and we might eventually gracefully concede the point, and say we would do our best to induce the sheikh to conclude a perpetual agreement provided that the Air Ministry would provide the £500 per annum. This is, of course/course, what some people call 'bazaar bargaining' (and what other people call 'compromise'), but this is a hard world and such vulgar methods are often effective* 10* Colonel Loch will doubtless be asked his opinion on the whole question, as on the point raised in the enclosure to the Air Ministry’s letter. (3d.) T.C. POWLEJ rf Please see Political Resident's air mail letter forwarding a letter from Major Bremner about the Sultan of Muscat's dissatisfaction with the effect of Article 15 of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement, flagged A, holes which can be picked in the Sultan's argument, e.g. it is rather absurd for him to say that he is 'out of pocket' when the position is in fact that he is merely failing to make a lot of money which if he had not agreed to waive customs duties on Imperial Airways petrol and oil he would o^herwiae be making; but he seems to have a good case in equity since it is obvious that he did not realise at all what he was committing himself to when he signed the agreement, and, whereas when he signed Imperial Airways were only doing one flight a week in either direction, they are now doing two and may in future be doing more. A possible compromise which suggests itself would be that a figure should be estimated which would the amount of customs dues from which Imperial Airways would have been exempted on the basis of the at P.Z.4426/35 below. There are obviously several— mmmm 'j/y 2 - conditions existing when the Agreement was signed, viz. duty on the amount of petrol and oil required sum could then he taken as the amount of customs rebate to which Imperial Airways would be entitled under the Agreement. The first step, however, seems to be to test the reactions of the Air Ministry to Colonel Fowle’s r\ for one flight in each direction a week. This fixed proposal.

In view of the recent expansion of Imperial Airways services and the further expansion contemplated it is desirable that this question should be examined as affecting the various Arab States in the Persian Gulf* 3. In Kuwait and Bahrain the Rulers have agreed to exempt from customs or other duties petrol and oil imported by His Majesty^ Government or their Agents for the purpose of {Signature) refuelling / S. 44. » M F P— 101 3 S &amp; P— ( M -1 323)—3( t-1 6-33—TO ,00(). PP (Designation)refuelling all civil aircraft, and His Majesty’s Government have agreed to pay the Ruler a sum representing the customs on petrol and oil retailed in the Stste by His Majesty s Go'\a*nment or their Agents for the refuelling of aircratt other than those of Imperial Airways• This payment is in addition of course to the £500 per annum which His Majesty^ Government pay the Ruler as annual rental* 4* In Muscat, where a similar rental of £500 is paid to the Sultan, while all oil and petrol for the use of all civil aircraft are subject to import duty, the Ruler has agreed to refund quarterly the duty collected on petrol and oil actually issued for the use of Imperial Airways. The reason for this difference in procedure in Muscat from that adopted in Bahrain and Kuwait was that the Sultan wished to preserve to himself the form of collecting customs duty. 5. In all these three States therefore the concession to Imperial Airways is the same in result* Owing to the difference in procedure, however, the extent, in terms ol cash, represented by the concession of customs free fuel that Imperial Airways enjoy is not apparent in Kuwait or Bahrain, whereas it stands out prominently at Muscat. 6. The rate of customs duty at present levied on petrol and oil at Bahrain and Kuwait is 5% gd valorem* In the negotiations preceding the conclusion of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement the Bahrain Government estimated on the basis of a weekly service (vide my telegram No*T/51, dated the 13th March 1934) the monetary value of the concession of exemption from duty on petrol and oil used by Imperial Airways at £125 per annum* Its value on the basis of the present bi-weekly service may therefore be estimated at £250* At Kuwait, owing /owing to the smaller number of landings the figure is certainly less. At Muscat, however, duty is levied at the rate of 10% and it is on this account that the refund of duty by the Sultan exceeds £500. 7. It may be noted that fuel inserted for the use of the Royal Air Force is exempted from customs duty at Kuwait and Muscat but pays duty at Bahrain at the rate of 5%. 8. While under the terms of the Civil Air Agreement the payment by His Majesty’s Government of the annual rental of £600 was inclusive and intended to cover the concession of exemption from customs duty on petrol and fuel used by Imperial Airways I do not think it was quite appreciated at the time that the monetary value of this concession would rise so rapidly* I suggest therefore that in order to prevent the Rulers of these States from feeling that they have not received sufficient consideration for the privileges accorded by them to K is Majesty’s Government unier the Civil Air Agreement (a feeling which will tend to intensify as Imperial Airways services are further expanded) it should be accepted as a principle that the annual rental of £600 should be in the nature of a net gain to the State, and that the State should be compensated for the loss incurred in granting the concession of customs free fuel to Imperial Airways. It should oe remembered in this connection that the annual rental of £600 secures other valuable privileges, e*g* exemption irom payment of landing fees. I am not aware of the scale of landing fees charged by foreign countries, but on the analogy of the scale laid down in Scheduled 1 to the Civil Air Agreement, la^erial Airways, on their present bi-weekly service, would appear to be saved landing fees alone (calculated at £2 per landing) of £400/-£400 per pinT&gt;|im at each of the places concerned. The Company therefore can hardly object to paying customs duty on fuel used by it. 9 . At the same time, in view of the fact that the acceptance of the principle referred to in the immediately preceding para graph represents an ex gratia concession on the part of His Hajesty's Government^that the permission accorued by nis Majesty's Government to the Ruler of Muscat to levy in$&gt;or&lt; duty at a rate higher than 5% is a concession of a similar nature and that it is desirable that there should be uniformity in this matter, I recommend that the concession suggested in my immediately preceding paragraph should be calculated on a uniform basis of a 5% duty ad valorem irrespective of the rate of customs duty actually charged, e.g. at Muscat. 10. The term of duration of the Civil Air Agreement is four years, but if the principles mentioned in paragraphs 7 and * are accepted I consider that steps should be taken to give effect to them forthwith by altering clauses IS and 16 of the Kuwait and Bahrain, and clauses IS and 17 of the Muscat 'Heads of Agreement' so as to provide for a compensatory payment by His Majesty's Government to the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain at the rate of 5% ad valorem on all petrol and oil used by Imperial Airways, and for the refund by the Sultan of Muscat of a half instead of the whole of the 10% duty levied by him on such petrol and oil. Alternatively, at Bahrain and at Kuwait the Agreements may be altered merely to provide for payment by Imperial Airways of duty on all petrol and oil imported by them, whether it is for their own use or not. A convenient date from which to reckon the change would be 1st January 1936 about when Airways services were duplicated. 11 . /r&gt; URGENT» Political Agency d H.B.M*s Consulate, Muscat, 2nd June 1936• From Major C'E'U.Bremner, M.C • , X *4% • , Political Agent &lt;k H.B.M's Consul, Muscat* To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• mmm subject*- Civil Air Agreement* Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the copy of a letter dated 1st June 1935 received from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat concerning the rebate of Customs duty which, under the terms of the Blvll Air Agreement, he is bound to make to Messrs the Imperial Airways, the constituted Agents of Government* 2* His Highness unfortunately did not mention the matter to me at Gwadur, where the figures could have been checked in situ, but in the course of a recent conversation with me, he showed me his own Arabic notes culled from the Customs records* There appears no reason to doubt these records as they were personally inspected by Hie Highness* 3* Assuming therefore that His Highness's figures are correct, it would appear that whereas he receives only 8s 6,760 (£ 600 ^ % 13/8) p*&amp;* as consideration for the use of Gwadur aerodrome, he repays 8s 7,620 on Customs rebate and is actually out of pocket % 870/- on the whole transaction, apart from the major loss to his revenues*! \ - 2 - 4« It would certainly appear that when the clause dealing with customs rebate on fuel and oil was being evolved no one realised the amounts involved. Certainly His Highness did not and, as X am not sufficiently acquaints* • &gt; with requirements of large aircraft in such matters t I was nc in a position to draw attention to the fact myself. 5. As Hie Highness points out the service has been doubled since the Agreement was concluded f and a further increase is rumoured, to the great detriment of the State revenues. 6. That the Sultan should be at a loss over the Agreement, is obviously not the intention of His Jtt&amp;jesty^ Government. A modification therefore of clause 15 of the Heads of the Civil Air Agreement would appear essential, whereby the rebate on fuel and oils should either be cancelled, or so modified, that the Sultan is not called on virtually to pay Government for the privilege of having an aerodrome in his territories. 7. In forwarding the matter for your early consideration I would strongly recommend that action on the above lines may be taken. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- C.fi.U.Bremner. &amp;ajor, Political ..gent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. ASM.Muscat 9 1-6-36. To Our Friend the Political Agent &lt;1 H.B.M*a Consul, Muscat. As you are aware that recently we have been to Gwadur and in course of investigation during our stay there we discovered that the planes of Imperial Airways use petrol and oil of which the approximate monthly average comes as follows j- Petrol, 2000 tins, duty Rs 625/- @ annas 5 per tin. Oil, 240 gallons, duty about Rs 10/-. i Now according to the agreement was concluded in Octo ber last between ourselves and our friend H.M's Government we have to refund the Customs duty which has been collected on the petrol consumed by the planes of that Company during the year. Since the conclusion of the above agreement the Air service of Imperial Airways has doubled and it is said that it may be even still further increase. i£ven as things are, the amount that we refund on oil and petrol is greater than that which we receive for the aerodrome and landing ground at Gwadur and Shinas respecti vely. Any increase of the service will mean an even greater loss to us. The Government is well aware of the financial condi tion of our state and we feel confident that it was never their intention that we should thus be put to such great loss by the conclusion of the agreement. On the contrary we think that our friend the Government desired that we should be benefited by the agreement. We request therefore that you will bring the matter to the attention of H.M's Government and this matter may be revised in the light of actual facts. Your sincere Friend, Sd/- Said bin Taimur.

Dear Laithwaite, ^ June^ 1935. I am sorry that there has been some delay in replying to your letter dated 8 th April last, PZ.2361/35, with which you enclosed an original Special Authorisation issued by the Sultan of Muscat in favour of Imperial Airways Ltd. With regard to the small clerical errors in the Authorisation_,to which you drew attention, we agree that, as the registration markings of the aircraft have been quoted correctly in this case, and to save the bother of sending the Authorisation back to Muscat, the errors might be ignored. We have, therefore, had photostatic copies made of the Special Authorisation for sending to Imperial Airways Ltd. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter, we think that on the whole it would have been preferable not to have sub-divided the aircraft into those making regular flights and those making emergency flights. In point of fact,three of the aircraft in the first mentioned sub-division, namely, Gr-ABTK, G-ABTL and G-AASP should have been included in the list of aircraft required to make emergency flights and conversely, aircraft G-AAXE is engaged on the regular service. As you will appreciate, it may at any time become necessary for Imperial Airways Ltd. to utilise aircraft listed under the second sub-division on their regular service flights. We suggest, therefore, that when the renewal of this authorisation becomes due the whole of the list of aircraft should be shown without any sub-division. /We J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.l. .£We note that you enclosed with your letter the original of a further Authorisation signed and sealed by the Sultan on the 20th March. We are not sure why this Authorisation was signed as no aircraft company is • mentioned in it and we assume that it has only been forwarded for reference purposes. In this connection you will be aware that the Special Authorisation issued to Imperial Airways Ltd. by the Shaikh of Kuwait expired on the 22nd May, 19b5, and I shall be glad to know whether a renewal of the Authorisation has yet been obtained.

Mr. Wal V The sultan of Ivluscat has now approved the amended Air Navigation Regulations and Conditions Governing the Use of Gwadur Aerodrome. I have checked through the text of the agreement, which is quite accurate, except for two or three very snail misprints which can, I think, tie ignored, and I have had prints made of the non-confidential portions of the civil Air Agreement in the same way as we dia in the case of Koweit and Bahrein. approach the Dutch Government ana ask them to inform the K.L.M. tnat they shoula now apply through the Political Resident for a special authorisation for the use of Gwadur Aerodrome, as agreed with the Foreign Office and I the Air Ministry in the correspondence ending at P.Z.1862/35 (flagged). in the case of the French Government and the French company using Gwadur, without further reference to the Sultan (subject to the concurrence of the Resident on this point). The sultan was in direct correspondence with tne French Consul at Bushire regarding the use of Gwadur hy the French company ana nad granted provisional permission to the French to use tne Aerodrome, subject to a final agreement regarding the payment to be made for this facility. This correspondence seems to have lapsed, however, in June :iast year (copies of the sultan’s letters are enclosed :ji the flesiaent's express letter of 15th May below); The next step is for the Foreign Office to 3 3 Similar action can also be taken, I think, but/2 but the question of payment has since been covered by the Civil Air Agreement, which ve&amp;ts in H.M.G. the exclusive right to maintain the aerodrome and ancillary services at Gwadur and to charge fees for the use of the aerodrome and for such ancillary services* In view of this it seems unnecessary, if the Resident agrees, to approach the Sultan again before asking the French to arrange for a formal application by the French company for a special authorisation. In this connection please see para.5 of Colonel Fowle's express letter of 10th December last, at P.Z.7940/24, where he expressed the opinion that for the same reason it was unnecessary to approach His Highness again about the Dutch. The special authorisation ie-, of course, signed by the Sultan and^constitute^ his formal permission to the companies in question to make use of his aerodrome.

Will you please refer to India Office letter No, P.Z.540/35 of the 2nd February about the Muscat Civil Air Agreement? You will remember that, on your enquiring, prior to the despatch of the express letter to Bushire of which that letter enclosed a copy, whether we had any objection to the amendments to the Agreement proposed in your letter No. P.Z.7940/34 of the 8th January to Bertram and Bertram’s reply of the 24th January to you, I told you that we had none, except on the point raised in Bertram’s letter a propos of paragraph 12 of your own. should be told to apply for the 'Special Authorisation' which they will require under the Air Navigation regulations and to whom that application should be made. The point in question is exactly how the K.L.M. As J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E.As regards the second point we agree that the company should apply to the Political Resident. As regards the first point, you will recall that in our note of the 13th November, 1933, to the Netherlands Minister, a copy of which was enclosed in our official letter No. E 6431/11/91 of the 15th November, 1933 to the India Office, we promised to let him know the conditions on which foreign aviation companies would be allowed to use the Sultan’s territories, as soon as these were received. In these circumstances it seems to us that the correct course will be for us to send the Minister a copy of the ’’Regulations 1 ' and 'Conditions 11 , when these have finally been approved by the Sultan, asking him to inform the company that they should apply at Bushire for a special authorisation. It is true that in the 1933 note we also gave a similar undertaking to the Minister about Bahrain, but it should not be necessary to emphasise, or indeed to refer to this point in writing to him, unless you think that it would be as well to communicate the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement at the same time. On the other hand, the Dutch areare already using Gwadur and will therefore he hound to take out a special authorisation as soon as the Civil Air Agreement comes into force. It will seem a little discourteous if the Agreement comes into force and is applied to the K.L.M. without our fulfilling our promise to keep the Netherlands Minister informed. Will you let me know your views about this? I am sending a copy of this letter to Bertram. c'-wv S C C'W',2 \\^ v &lt;s&gt; A^t CONFIDENTIAL. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

To / Secretary of State for India, London. Repeated Government of India, New Delhi. U°' 0 . &amp; f&gt; 9 - Political Agent, Muscat. J 0 o SUBJECT: Muscat Air Agreement. \\ With reference to correspondence ending with India Office Printed Letter No©P.2*401/35, dated the 18th January 1935, I enclose a copy of Express Letter No*F.104-N/33 of 12th January 1935 from the Foreign and Political Department, Government of India. 2. The territory of the Sultan of Muscat as far as the Civil Air Agreement is concerned divides itself into two categories x A. GWADUR . and B. ARABIAN TERRITORY . 3. With regard to A . The position is as follows: (1) Before the conclusion of the Air Agreement the Dutch were given permission hg the Sultan to fly over and land - vide paragraph 5 of my Express Letter No.ll69-S of 10th December 1934, but have still under the Air Agreement to obtain /obtain authorisation in respect of each aircraft. I suggest that the Netherlands Government be asked to apply to the Sultan through His Majesty's Government for such authorisation. (2) The French Government (vide paragraph 2 (a) of Foreign Office letter No.£.176/17/91^ dated the 18 th January 1935 to the India Office), have approached the Sultan for permission for their aircraft to use Gwadur, and I will ask His Highness when I meet him at Muscat next week what reply he gave: if in the affirmative then AIR FRANCE will be in the same position as the Dutch and will have to obtain authorisation from the Sultan for each of their aircraft. (3) Private aircraft. As the Government of India - vide their Express Letter quoted above - point out ; the position at Gwadur is different to that at Kuwait and Bahrain, but under the terms of the Regulations it would be necessary to apply to the Sultan for authorisation in ever^ case. While authorisation in case of commercial aircraft is a matter of no difficulty as such craft fly regularly over the route and are given an authorisation only once a year, application to the Sultan for each casual flight, ana such flights may be expected to increase in numbers as time goes on, will lead to delay and correspondence which should be avoided if possible. There are two ways in which this can be effected: (a) by amending the Regulations so that no authorisation is necessary for private fliers, or (b) by asking the Sultan to delegate his authority for granting authorisation to the Government of India for flights starting from India, and to His Majesty's Government for those start ing from England. I am in favour of (b), and I would be grateful /grateful for telegraphic sanction addressed to Muscat, where I shall be from 7th to 12th February, to approach the Sultan accordingly* 4. With regard to B* (1) Commercial aircraft* The position is that there is only one Company i.e. Imperial Airways, flying over such territory i.e. the tip of Has Musandam (though Shinas may occasionally be used. Kalba which is required as an emergency landing ground is not in Muscat territory). I concur that the minor modifications suggested in paragraph 8 of India Office letter No .P.Z.7940/34 of 8th January 1935 to the Air Ministry will make it clear that civil aircraft in general are not permitted to fly over Muscat territory other than Gwadur and that the requirements of Imperial Airways will be covered by the separate letter from the Sultan proposed in paragraph 9. I would be grateful, for telegraphic orders addressed to Muscat as to whether I should approach His Highness for such letter* ^ (2) Private flights* The prohibition by the Shaikhs of Kuwait (vide Residency Express Letter NO.1890-S of 11th December 1933) and Bahrain (vide Residency Express Letter No* 920-S of 27th July 1933) was made prior to the conclusion of the Civil Air Agreements and was required in the absence of such agreements* Now, however, Clause 1 of the Regula tions under the Agreements covering Kuwait and Bahrain as well as Muscat provides that aircraft shall not fly over, or land in these States except under a special authorisation issued by His Highness the Sultan* There would therefore appear to be no necessity for the general prohibition suggested /suggested in paragraph 7 of the India Office letter referred to. sd.

Position of G-vsadur is different to t T *t of Kuwait and Bahrain seeing that two latter cannot be utilised at all for casual flights whereas Gwadur will have to be used by all Indian aircraft making flights along ’ersian Gulf route, specia 1 autho rization being necessary in each case. 9 . It is not clear whether difference in conditions has been fully realised in drawing terms of Regulation*- uniformly v/ith those approved fo~ Kuwait and Bahrain.

Yours sincerely. J•Gr. LAITHWAITS.'i?hank you for your letter of 8 th instant, P.Z.7940/34, on the subject of the Civil Air Agreement which has been concluded with the Sultan of Muscat. We have the following observations to offer on the various points which you have raised:- Paragraph 3 . We agree that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company through their agents at Gwadur should be appointed suppliers for the purpose of certifying the quantity of j fuel issued for the exclusive use of Imperial Airways Ltd. under paragraph IE of the Heads of Agreement with the Sultan. Paragraph 4. We see no objection to the new paragraph 16 which has been inserted in the Heads of Agreement. We are considering the question whether His Majesty^ Government or Imperial Airways Ltd. should be responsible for the nominal monthly rent and perhaps you would let us know in aue course the amount involved. / Paragraph 5. Your observations are noted. Paragraph 6 . We note the points you have raised with ^ Colonel jrowle and that you will await his reply before considering the matters further. Paragraph 7 . We certainly agree that civil aircraft other / than those of Imperial Airways should be prohibited from flying over or landing in the Arabian territories of j.u. Laithwaite Osq., ENCLOSURE IN V.ii : India Ufiice, S.W.l. ■ f-!o. -S o' J9 j5 | FROM SECRETARY, PCLI, C. /MuscatI.] iViuscat save with the specific prior permission of the Multan. We also agree that the Air Navigation Regulations should he amended so as to make this point clear to all concerned. With regard to your draft amendments to the Regulations, etc. it would appear that you have proceeded on the assumption that civil ^ aircraft other than those of Imperial Airways Ltd. should not use Uwadur except with the prior permission of the Sultan. As you know, private aircraft and aircraft engaged on occasional commercial flights have made use of d-wadur now for some years past and it has never been the practice to seek the previous consent of the Sultan for such flights. We should be very much averse to disturbing this position particularly in view of the time which would elapse in each case in obtaining the Sultan’s permission (presumably action would have to be taken through your department and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.) We hope, therefore, that the Sultan will be prepared to continue this principle of freedom of innocent passage for occasional flights across his territory on the north side of the Gulf of Oman including landings at Gwadur. If he seems likely to object it might be pointed out to him that the facilities have been afforded for some years now and are in accordance with the practice which is now almost universally adopted towards private and other occasional flights. As regards the amendments which will be required to give effect to the foregoing we suggest the following for your consideration. AIR NAVIGATION REGULAflQNS . Heading : Add ’’and Oman' after 'MUSCAT'. Divide Paragraph 1 into three parts as follows:- Paragraph 1 (i) . Insert after 'land in the' the words ’^Arabian territories of Muscat' in place of 'territory of muscat'. Paragraph 1 (ii) . Aircraft engaged in regular air services shall not fly over the territories of muscat on the north side of the Gulf of Oman or land at Gwadur except under a special authorisation issued by his Highness the Sultan. / Paragraph 1 (iii ).Paragraph 1 (iiij . Aircraft other than those engaged in regular air services may fly over the territories of his Highness The Sultan on the north side of the Gulf of Oman and land at Gwadur without such special ^ authorisation. Paragraph 2. Delete the words 'so authorised'. Insert the words''and Oman' after 'Muscat'. Insert before 'such o;her supplementary conditions' as the commencement of a second sentence to this paragraph the words 'Aircraft whose flight is authorised under Paragraphs 1 (i) and lii) above shall in addition comply with'. 1 / Paragraph 4 . insert after 'place' in line 2 the words 'in Muscat and Oman'. Por 'the aerodrome at Muscat' substitute 'an aerodrome approved for the purpose by His Highness the Sultan'. Paragraph 11 . Insert the word 'at' after 'abroad' in line 1. substitute for the words 'Muscat Aerodrome' the words 'aerodromes in the territory of muscat and Oman'. Paragraph 12 . ror 'Muscat ' 1 substitute 'the territory of Muscat and Oman'. CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USE OP THE AERODROME We agree with your suggestions. The heading would then be, GWADUR AERODROME . CONDITIONS 'LAID DOWN WITH THE APPROVAL oi 1 THE SULTAN TO GOVERN THE USE OP THE AERODROME . A similar form ‘mutatis mutandis* could be used for Shinas and for any other civil aerodromes which may be used in the territory. / SPECIALSPECIAL AUTHORISATION. Heading : Add 'and Oman' after ’‘Muscat” in both places. Paragraph 1 . Add the words ’’and Oman” after 'The Sultan of iLuscat”. Substitute in line 2 for the word “Muscat' ^ the words 'his territory”. ^ Paragraph 2 liiJ . It seems to us that, so far as imperial Airways are concerned, it might be desirable to leave this sub-paragraph in its present form, provision being made in line 3 for landings at two places, viz. uwadur and Shinas. vVith regard to the suggestions in paragraph 9 of your letter, while we agree that the Sultan should be asked to grant, in a separate letter, special permission for imperial Airways aircraft to fly across the tip of Musandim Peninsula it seems unnecessary to obtain his special permission,other than in the form of the special authorisation ivalid for viwadur and Shinasfor the use of Shinas. in the cases, however, of the Dutch and irench air services which at present make occasional landings at v^wadur, we agree that the wording suggested in your letter (adding perhaps 'and Oman” after 'Muscat' for consistency) for this sub-paragraph should be used in the authorisations to be issued by xhe Sultan. if and when these services (or other services} are authorised to fly over the Arabian territories of Muscat the present form of authorisation, as suggested for Imperial Airways Ltd. could be used. There is a further point which arises in connection with the Schedule headed 'Detract from Air Ministry Notice to Airmen', and to which attention was previously drawn in respect of the Bahrein and Koweit Agreements (see my letter dated 3ru November, 1934, numbered as above and your reply thereto of 7th November, 1934, P.Z.6845/34). The 'i&amp;tract' in question should, we suggest, be headed at the top 'Schedule I' f anQ 'Schedule II' as a heading to Housing Pees should be deleted. As regards the Schedule of charges for attendance and other facilities (referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Heads of Agreement and also in paragraph 3 of the 'Conditions governing the use of the Aerodrome' and intended to be Schedule II to the Agreement) you will recall that a list of the charges proposed to be made by Imperial /Airways Ltd.Airways Ltd. was communicated to the India Office with my letter dated 21st August, 1933, No.248985/33/D.D.C.A. at least so far as private aircraft are concerned. I enclose a further copy for ease of reference. In subsequent correspondence on the question of including also in the Schedule the charges for use of the aerodromes by public transport aircraft it was agreed that it was unnecessary to publish these charges until such V time as foreign air services are permitted to use the Arabian Coast aerodromes. A s the French and Dutch use Owadur, however, we are asking Imperial Airways to let us have a list of their proposed charges for public transport aircraft for y inclusion in Schedule II to the Gwadur Agreement. I will forward the list to you as soon as it is received. Paragraph 12. We agree with the Political Resident that it is unnecessary to approach The Sultan again for permission for the Dutch to fly over his territory on the north side of the Gulf of Oman and to land at Gwadur. The Dutch will, however, have to obtain special authorisation in the agreed form and we assume that, in view of paragraph 5 of the Heads of Agreement, the Company should be instructed to make the necessary application through the Political Resident at Bushire. Perhaps you will consider and let me know whether the Political resident should prompt the Dutch Company in this matter or whether action should be taken by the Air Ministry. Paragraph 13 . We note the action you have taken with the Foreign Office regarding the question of permission for the French company to use Gwadur. Paragraph 14 . We certainly agree that it is desirable to have all the abovementioned points cleared up as soon as possible. There do not appear to be any amendments required in this connection to the Heads of Agreement and in any case it is presumably undesirable that they should have to be amended so soon after signature.6 . 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel at the foreign Office.

(a) Permission for French aircraft to use Gwadar. As I have already explained to you over the telephone, it seems to us that in his express letter No.1169 - S of the 10th December, Powle has misconceived the present position. In their note of the 6th September, 1933, a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No.E 5287/11/91 of the 14th September, J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E0 (3 September, 1933, to the India Office, the French Government stated that the French Consul at Bushire had already approached the Sultan of Muscat with regard to this question. Whether the Sultan ever replied to that communication does not appear from our papers; he may of course have done so without our being aware of the fact, any more than we were aware of the French Consul’s approach until the French Government told us of it. In any case we I suggest that before we make any further enquiries of the French Government Fowle might be asked to enquire what reply, if any, was returned to the French Consul’s representations. 3. (b) Prohibition of flights by civil aircraft over the Arabian dominions of the Sultan of Muscat . We agree generally with the views expressed in your letter to Bertram and we also concur in the detailed amendments in the Air Navigation Regulations and connected papers which you propose in paragraph 8 of that letter. 4. (c)4 (e) Insistence on special authorisation for private fliers using Gwadar * The Persian Government require private fliers who desire to pass over or land in Persia to apply for permission to do so. We see no reason, therefore, why the Sultan of Muscat should not equally insist on this requirement, if you consider it desirable that he should. 5. Finally, with reference to paragraph 12 of your letter to Bertram, we agree that there appears to be no necessity for obtaining the Sultan’s formal sanction for the use of Gwadar by the Dutch. But presumably if or when the Dutch and French start using the Arab Coast route, special permission will be sought from the Sultan for their aircraft to fly over the Musandim Peninsula. 6.

Before proceeding to discuss the desirability of certain alterations in the woraing of the Air Agreement, I will, if I may, deal with the following minor points. 3. We should be glad, in the first place, to know whether the Air Council agree that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, through their agents at Gwadur, should be appointed suppliers for the purpose of certifying the quantity of fuel issued for the exclusive use of Imperial Airways under paragraph 15 of the Heads of Agreement betweeh His Majesty's Government and His Highness?

Bertram, Esq., C.B.E.,/ fa - Gwydyr House, Whitehall, 3.?;. 10 0ANJ935 TIC;! 4 /4. will you be so kind also as to confirm that you see no objection to the new paragraph 16 which has been inserted in the Heads of Agreement? 5. You will see that Major Bremner is taking steps to obtain from the sultan the necessary letter in regard to the use of aerodromes by military aircraft and the continued provision of free facilities for Service machines. He has also been instructed to take steps to obtain the necessary special authorisations for the use of Muscat territory by machines of Imperial Airways. 6. Prom my letter of 4th January, No. p.Z.66/35, to Burkett, you will see tnat we have further asked Colonel Powle to confirm our assumption that the drawback, under Article 15 of the Air Agreement will operate as from the date of signature of the Agreement. We have also raised with him the question of the method of payment of the arrears (and in future of the annual rent under the Agreement) aue to the sultan. It seems not unlikely to prove simplest in practice that the Resident should issue this amount locally on behalf of tne Air Ministry, the necessary adjustment being made between the India Office and the Air Ministry, but we- 3 - can leave this point over until we receive Colonel Fowle’s reply. 7, It has occurred to us in connection with the Agreement which has now been signed that it may be well at this stage to take up with the sultan of Muscat, in the same way as in agreement with tne Air Ministry and the Foreign Office we have taken it up previously with the sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, the question of advising His Highness definitely to prohibit civil aircraft, whether commercial or private (with the exception, of course, of Imperial Airways) from flying over or landing in the Arabian territories of Muscat, save with the specific prior permission of the sultan. The effect of such prohibition would, of course, be to confine civil aircraft in general 7 so far as Muscat territory is concerned, to Gwadur, the position of which is quite different, ana where the special considerations which have maae us think it desirable to preclude private flights on the Arabian mainland do not operate. V/e are inclined to think that this point could on tne whole probably most satisfactorily be covered by slight modifications in the text of the civil Air Agreement the effect of which would be to restrict (save in the case/case of Imperial Airways, for whom a special route would he laid aown) civil aircraft to Gwadur. We regard it as of some importance in view of the fact that the various parts of the Civil Air Agreement, other than the confidential Heads of Agreement between His Majesty‘s Government and the sultan, will ultimately he published, tha.t the terms of the Regulations should make it clear that civil aircraft in general are not permitted to fly over Muscat territory other than Gwadur. 8. we are inclined, in these circumstances, subject to your comments ana those of the Foreign Office, to suggest the following minor modifications in the Air Navigation Regulations ana the connected papers (other than the Heads of Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the sultan, in which no modification will be necessary). Air Navigation Regulations . Paragraph 4 . Insert at the beginning 'save with tne specific prior permission of the sultan'. Substitute 'Gwadur for 'Muscat'. For 'aerodromes' read 'aerodrome'. Paragraph II . substitute 'Gwadur' for 'Muscat', paragrapn 15 , After 'Muscat' where mentioned insert tne word 'territory'.Conaitions Kove rnln^; the use oT^iae aeroarome . In the heading cuhstitute 'Gwaaur' for 'Muscat''. Alternatively we might omit the woras 'in Muscat' altogether? The notice would he posted at Gwaaur aerodrome ana could he given a general heading 'Gwaaur Aerodrome'. Special Authorisation . In the heading insert the wora 'territory' after 'Muscat'. par agraph s(ii) . Redraft to read; 'Ihe aircraft ^hall not, save with the special permission of His Highness the sultan, fly over the Arabian territories of His Highness or use as a place of landing or departure within Muscat territory any place other than the aerodrome at Gwadur and...' 9 . in the event of the modifications suggested above being accepted the sultan will be invited to grant in the case of Imperial Airways, in a separate letter, special permission to fly across the tip of the Musandim peninsula along the route already agreed between us, and in the event of emergency to land at shinas. 10. would you be so kind as to let me know whether the Air Ministry would see any objection to action on these lines? 11. a further point for consiaeration on which we should welcome your views and those of the Foreign Office is whether, in the event of the sultan agreeing- 6 - to exclude private tilers from his aominions on the Arabian mainland, we need insist on the issue of a special authoris ation to private fliers (as opposed to regular air services) in respect of Gwadur or whether we might agree that private fliers should he permitted, as hitherto, to fly over or land at Gwadur without a special authorisation, so long as the necessary visa has first 'been obtained by them? I am not quite clear what the present position is in regard to private flights along the Persian coast and there might be something to be said for making the procedure at Gwadur conform to that which obtains in respect of aerodromes along the old Imperial Airways route. If the Persians insist on a special authorisation being obtained in respect of landings in their territory by private fliers, there is no reason why we should not ao the same at Gwadur. 12. On the point discussed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Colonel Fowle’s express letter 1169-S of 10th December, we are disposed, subject to your observations and those of the Foreign Office, to agree with the Resident tnat it is unnecessary for His Majesty's Government to make a special approach to His Highness. It will however in due course be necessary for the K.L.M# to obtain authorisations in the sanctioned form for their flights over and calls at Gwadur. Would you be so kind as to let me know your views? 13/13. I am taking up with tne Foreign Office in the letter of which I enclose a copy the point raisea in paragraph 6 of colonel Fowle’s express letter of 10th December. 14. We should be grateful if you could let us have your comments on the points raised above as early as possible. The sultan is now proposing to return to toscat on 30th January and it seems desirable to approach him without delay on his return about any alterations which we may wish to make in the Agreement, etc. Apart from this, you will agree that the sooner we reach finality as regards the terms of the Air Agreement, the authorisations, etc., and dispose of the various minor points which are still outstanding, the better. 15.

There remains the question of flights by the French, who, so far as I am aware, have not yet replied to the representations made by His Majesty f s Government on behalx of His Highness the Sultan that their flights over ana land ings in Gwadur shoula be regularized by a formal application from them requesting the necessary permission (vide corres pondence ending with letter dated the 5th September 1933, from the British Embassy laris to the Bastem Department, Foreign Office - India Office P.Z.5806/33). As there is now no French Consul at Bushire to convey a request in this behalf direct to His Highness the Sultan the present would seem a suitable time to press the French Government for a reply. sd.

It will be observed that the Political Resident estimates the amount in question at £688:18:0, of which £188:18:0 is in respect of the period 7th Janary 1934 to 23rd May 1934. The Secretary of State is not clear on what basis this latter figure has been reached. On a yearly basis it would appear to be too high and on a monthly basis too low: but the difference involved is in any event very small. The Air Council will no doubt consider whether 23rd May 1934 might not more appropriately be regarded as ths first day of the period covered by the formal agreement which has nov/ been concluded. 2 ./ The Seqretary, Air Ministry, Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W.l.&lt; 2 . 2. Attention is also invited to paragraph 4 of the enclosure to Colonel Fowle’s despatch of 23rd November in regard to the question of future payments of the Sheikh T s annual subsidy under the Civil Air Agreement. Subject to the concurrence of the Air Council Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that payment might also now be made to the Sheikh of Koweit in respect of the year from 23rd May 1934 to 23rd May 1935 and that further annual instalments of the Sheikh’s subsidy, and similar payments under the Bahrein and Muscat Civil Air Agreements, might in future be made annually in advance on the date of signature of these Agreements.

Any communications on the subject of this letter should be addressed to :— THE SECRETARY, Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, K , London, W.C. 2. \/ ^^apd the following number quoted :— S.32956/D.D.C.A. October, 1934. Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to India Office letter dated 10th September 1934, No. PZ.5737/34, for warding a copy of a despatch from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the proposed civil air agreement with the Sultan of Muscat. 2. The Council note that the Sultan wishes to have Article 1 of the draft Heads of Agreement modified with the object, apparently, of obtaining additional payment for any further civil aerodromes which may subsequently be required for use in his territory in addition to those mentioned in the draft agreement, viz:- Gwadur and Shinas. 3. 1 am to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that the Council are prepared to agree in principle that extra payment should be made for any further landing facilities which may be required and afforded in Muscat territory for the civil air service. They desire, however, that the Agreement with the Sultan should, so far as possible, be in the same terms as those concluded with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit and, therefore, they would prefer that Article 1 should remain as drafted. 4. The Council suggest, therefore, that, subject to Sir Samuel Hoare's concurrence, the Political Resident should be instructed to approach the Sultan on the lines which he suggests in the second paragraph of his letter. 5. Iffith regard to paragraph 3 of the Political Resident* s letter the Council note that the Sultan has offered to exempt from payment of Customs duties petrol, oil and stores imported into Muscat for use by the Royal Air Force, but that he wishes to levy duties on similar stores imported for use by Imperial Airways Limited. 6. I am to say that, as regards ’’aircraft and spare parts therefor and aero engines and spare parts therefor” to be used on the civil air service the Council cannot agree that Customs duties should be payable, and they note that the Political Resident will press for exemption in respect of this material. The wireless apparatus (including d/F) and spare parts therefor at Gwadur are the property of the Air Council and should also be exempt from Customs duties. 7. As regards the fuel and oil imported for use on the civil air service the Council hope that, as in the cases of Bahrein and Koweit, it may be possible to secure exemption also for this material. They suggest that the Political Resident should be asked to consider whether further representations could . . /be The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l.be made towards this end, the rental being regarded as an inclusive figure, • * * 8, It might, in this connection, be explained to the Sultan that, while His Majesty’s (iovernment do not desire to question his right to levy import duties on petrol and oil, they hope that he will be prepared to agree that corresponding drawbacks should be allowed in respect of such material taken on board aircraft of Imperial Airways Limited in Muscat territory for use on the civil air service. 9. On the question of the arrears to be paid in respect of the use of Gwadur landing ground by Imperial Airways Limited it is noted that the Sultan has asked for and that the Political Resident recommends that payment should be made as from 13th November, 1929. According to Air Ministry records, however, Imperial Airways Limited commenced using Gwadur on 8th June, 1929 and the Council would be prepared to arrange for payment to be made to the Sultan as from the earlier date. 10. In this connection I am to refer to the question of safeguarding the rights of the Royal Air Force to the use of landing grounds and flying boat anchorages in Muscat territory - see the demi-official letter dated 15th May, 1934, S.32956/34 from Mr. F.G.L. Bertram to Mr. J.G. Laithwaite. 11. The Council are anxious that the civil air agreement now under discussion, and particularly the proposal to make payment for the use of civil landing grounds in Muscat,shall in no way affect the free user of facilities there at present enjoyed by Royal Air Force aircraft, nor any additional ones which may be acquired in the future. The Council assume that, as in the cases of the Bahrein and Koweit civil air agreements, the Political Resident will be instructed to negotiate for an exchange of letters safeguarding this point. 12. If the Sultan proves difficult on this question of free user by the Royal Air Force the Political Resident might counter by suggesting that the amount of the arrears payment should be at a lower rate than £500 per annum seeing that Gwadur only has hitherto been used by the civil air service. 13. The Council do not desire that this point should be stressed, however, or even raised at all, except in the event of its being necessary to curb any rapacity which may be evinced by the Sultan in the negotiations. 14.

After compliments, With the hand of pleasure I have received your confidential letter No. C. 193, dated the 9th inst. (23.5.34), and understood what it contained with regard to the military aeroplanes belonging to or used in the service of His Majesty’s Government. We always have pleasure in assisting in any matters that appertain to His Majesty’s Government. The said military aeroplanes have, in the past, been using the aerodrome without ever being asked for anything in the way of fees, and the benzine which is imported and stored for their use is exempt from customs duty—all this in order to assist His Majesty’s Government. We now confirm that they, the military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrein Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £120 apart from the customs duty which it levies on benzine. We pray therefore that His Majesty’s Government will very kindly put us on an equality with others in this respect. Usual ending. Draft Letter to His Excellency Sheikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E , C.S.I., Ruler of Koiveit. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s letter No. R 4/1518 of 12th Safar 1353 (26th May 1934) to the Political Agent, Koweit, and note that Your Excellency confirms that the Royal^ Air Force aeroplanes shall enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, without prior permission, and without being charged anything. I am directed by His Majesty’s Government to thank Your Excellency for this. 2. In the same letter Y’our Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrein State are paid an annual rental of £120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3. His Majesty’s Government have directed me to reply as follows: It is possible that Your Excellency has not appreciated the difference between conditions at Bahrein and Koweit. At Bahrein there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island, for which the Boyal Air Force pay the £120 referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened, and the other on Muharraq, which is used by civil and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the same Agreement has been signed by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad as has been signed by you. 4. Moreover the £120 already referred to also includes the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, &amp;c., which is situated on Manamah. 5. At Koweit there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty’s Government regret, therefore, that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £120 which is paid to Bahrein, and Your Excellency, in the light of the above facts, will doubtless see that conditions in the two States are materially different. ♦These letters are confidential and are not for publication.

Political Agent considers it probable that he would agree to accept V | ^-z. draft if he received separate ret ter saying that sum (Sirpmtrtre*e 2 of £ 500 is amourt of payment while landing grounds at Grw&amp;dur and Shinas only are required, but that if in future further landing grounds are required for civil aircraft question of extra payment for additional facilities will be discussed with him, }£ay I approach Sultan accordingly ? 3* Sultan has, of his own accord, offered to exempt from payment of customsjduty petrol, oil and stores import ed for use of Royal Air Force, but wishes to impose duty on petrol, oil and stores imported for use of Imperial Airways as in the case of other civil air lines or private aviators. In view of his generous offer in regard to imports for Royal Air Force (who at Bahrain pas rental of £ 120 for Manama aerodrome and also pay customs duty on their petrol and oil) I feel that it would be inapprop riate to press the Sultan for exemption of duty on petrol and oil imported for use of Imperial Airways as well. and spare parts therefor, are the property of the Royal Air Force and not of Imperial Airways, they will come under the Sultan’s exemption of stores of the Royal Air Force. I am uncertain about the ownership. I propose to explain to Sultan that 'aircraft and spare parts therefor, aero engines, and spare parts therefor,” which may be stored at a landing ground for use of passing air craft or imported in case of breakdown are in a rather different category, being either the machines or for replacement in the machines, and to ask him to agree to exempting them from duty. If the above are accepted, certain modifications will be entailed in Articles lb and 16. May I accept Sultan’s wishes subject to modifica tions about 'aircraft and spare parts therefor, aero engines If the wireless and direction finding apparatus1 A - 3 - etc.' ? 4* The Sultan asks for payment from the 13th November 1929, the date on which Imperial Airways commenced to use G-wadur aerodrome. This means a considerable lump sum, but the political A^ent informs me that the Sultan demurred at the shs small annual remuneration and wanted to fix his own rates for foreigners. The Politic: 1 Agent was successful in persuading him not to raise these questions, but states that if he does not get the arrears, the Sultan will certainly revert to them. ~ ./e iiave enjoyed civil air facilities at (iwadur without let or hinderance ever since the institution of the air route and it seems fair (especially having regard to Sultan’s very helpful attitude in the matter of facilities for the Royal Air force) that in return payment should be made for the whole period (though Agreement as in Bahrain and Kuwait would run from the date of signature). I, therefore, recommend that payment from the 13th November 1929 should be made. I should be grateful for telegraphic instructions on the points raised. (Sgd) G.

No. : WHITEHALL 7171. .32956/34 IMMEDIATE. AIR MINISTRY, GWYDYR HOUSE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.1. 15th May, 1934. Dear Laithwaite, I must apologise for a little delay in answering your letter of 10th May, P.Z.3157/34, but it was necessary for me to let the Service side know what I was proposing to do, and also to obtain Air Ministry financial concurrence. I agree that in the first place we should try to get the Sultan of Muscat to agree to payment for the use of facilities for Imperial Airways civil air services as from 1st January, 1933; if the Sultan asks for an earlier date as the date from which payment will begin, which I hope he will not do, we shall have to consider it. I agree also that the India Office should telegraph to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf approving his proposal to negotiate a civil air agreement with Muscat on similar lines to those agreed in the case of Bahrein and Koweit. As, however, Shinas landing ground has been acquired for civil purposes, I suggest that Shinas should be linked with Gwadar and that the annual payment of £500 per annum should cover the use of both places. The Service side point out that in addition to Gwadar and Shinas there are a number of Service landing grounds and flying boat anchorages now in use in Muscat territory, the title to which should not be affected by the agreement now under consideration. It should, therefore, be made clear that the civil agreement which it is now proposed to negotiate with regard to Gwadar and Shinas should in no way affect Service facilities now existing in /Muscat J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., INDIA OFFICE, S. W. 1.t^L C Muscat territory nor any additional ones which may he acquired in the future. A similar proviso was inserted in the case of Manama landing ground in the Bahrein agreement. So far as the Service side are aware no charge is at present made by the Sultan of Muscat in respect of the Service facilities on Muscat territory and it is hoped that the civil payment for the use of Gwadar and Shinas will not cause the Sultan to raise questions with regard to payment for Service facilities. It would appear that there are two alternatives : * * (a) to raise the issue with the Sultan now, or (b) to assume^the position in so far as Service facilities are concerned will continue as in the past. It will be for the India Office and the Political Resident to decide which of these two courses is least likely to give rise to difficulties in the- future. I I hope that this letter will be in time for you to send instructions to the Political Resident, in time for t him to discuss the matter with the Sultan while he is in Muscat this week. I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel. Yours sincerely,INDEXED ■-&lt; ^ Si t. 6203 c:..; ga fei i- J 1 r L__ N krrZ tK! tf * ii AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAY. W.C.2. S.31992. ' /ft- ~ May, 1934. i [9 34 I ^ /: . v 1 *^ My dear ‘ ^ With reference to our telephone conversation this morning, I enclose herewith for your information, copy of a minute which has been written to Mr.Bertram (D.D.C.A# ) dealing with the Service aspect of the forthcoming civil agreement regarding Gwadur landing ground, on the subject of which you recently wrote to him. Mr.Bertram will no doubt mention the various points we have raised when he replies to your letter, but I thought it as well that I should write to you myself about the Service aspect of the matter, and then if you have any comments regarding that aspect you can communicate with us direct. Yours J.G.Laithwaite. Esq., India Office, S.W.l.COPY -121- l J D.D« C«A» 1* Reference your min proposals in Enclosure llQA'^as far as they go but there are other landing grounds in Muscat territory besides Grwadur, our title to which must be effectively secured. 2. The agreement which it is now proposed to negotiate with the Sheikh of Muscat is intended to deal with the landing grounds which are used for civil purposes. Service requirements in respect of those landing grounds being covered by a separate exchange of letters. I suggest therefore that Shinas landing ground which has been acquired for civil purposes should be linked with Gwadur in the agreement, the annual payment of £500 to cover both places. 3. As Kalba is not in Muscat territory, it is probable that a separate agreement will be necessary for that place if or when the Sheikh agrees to our using it, but I suggest whan that happens a comparatively small sum only should be paid to the Sheikh for facilities which will be seldom, if ever, used by civil aircraft. 4. In addition to Gwadur and Shinas, however, there are a number of Service landing grounds and flying boat anchorages now in use in Muscat territory, our title to which will not be affected by the agreement now under consideration. I suggest, therefore, that in the exchange of letters covering Service rights at Gwadur and Shinas it should be stated that the civil agreement which is being negotiated with regard to those places in no way affects the position regarding Service facilities now existing in Muscat territory nor any additional ones which may be acquired in the future. You will remember that a similar proviso was inserted in the case of Manama landing ground in the Bahrein agreement. As far as I am aware no charge is at present made by the Sheikh of Muscat in respect of these Service facilities and I hope the fact that the Sheikh is now about to receive the sum of £500 per annum for Gwadur and Shinas will not cause him to become avaricious in so far as Service facilities are concerned. We seem to have two alternatives : and I think it is for the political authorities to decide which course is least likely to give rise to difficulties in the future. I suggest you should ask Laithwaite to mention this aspect to Colonel Powle in the communication which is about to be sent to him. 5. Presumably you have obtained the necessary financial approval for payment required by Enclosure 119A. 6. Will you please let me have a copy of the letter you write to Mr.Laithwaite in reply to Enclosure 119A for inclusion in our file S.31992. (a) to raise the issue with the Sheikh now (b) to assume that the position in so far as service facilities are concerned will continue as in the past. 14.5.34 D.D.O.IINDIA OFFICE, / '3 iVHIXOHALL, 3.3.
