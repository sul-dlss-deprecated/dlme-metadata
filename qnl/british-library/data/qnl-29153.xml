It was not the intention that refugees from Iranian justice should be put back across the frontier. The suggestion was that they should be dealt with under the Passport Act and Rules of the Government of India and of the Kalat State. 3. As you are aware the Indian Passport Act, 1920 and the^ Indian Passport Rules, 1921, apply to British Baluchistan xalid and Agency territories* An alien who enters India without valid travel documents, can therefore be deported under Section 5 of the Indian Passport Act. The Government of India consider that the fact that there is no extradition treaty between India and Iran need not in all cases debar them from taking action under the Passport Act. They constantly deport Afghans who enter India without travel documents, although there is no extradition treaty with Afghanistan. They are therefore of opinion that Iranian subjects^xai entering the ^Joagai Agency without travel documents, except in cases where deportation might have the colour of extradition (e.g. if tnere were reason to believe that the Iranian Government had asked for extradition or was anxious to secure surrender of an individual) should aritkaarey ordinarily be deported under the Indian Passport Act. In cases where for good reason resort is not had to deportation, other action could be taken under the Indian Passport nules* 4. As regards penalties to be imposed for the breach of these rules, the Government of India agree that the imposition of fine may not always be feasible, but they consider that it would do no harm to proceed by way of iurorisonment in one or two specimen cases with the object of demonstrating that there are rules to be observed by those who wish to cross this part of the frontier and are inclined to treat it at present as non-existent. . * 5. The Government of India therefore will be glad if instructior. can be issued to all concerned to prevent the Indian Passport Act and Rules from becoming a dead letter La the Chagai Agency tSIffC (c.fthe case of persons who enter via Chaman route, vide Foreign and Political Department endorsement NooF.635-F/34, /U+*/I'!aau dated the 20th March 1935). Experience will then show how far similar measures can or need be enforced on that portion of the Indo-Iranian frontier occupied by the Kalat State. Sd/- O.K.

Since th^m they have been living in Quetta on the balance of the subsistence allowance originally sanctioned for them. They have now become destitute and have 3. frequently petitioned this Administration for subsistence allowance which has been refused. They now wish to return to the Ghagai Agency to live under the protection of the Sanjerani Sardar, who is prepared to keep them in his llaqa and to give them means for subsistence. Uie Political gent, Chagai, recommends that they may be allowed to return on the written guarantee of the Sanjerani Sardar that Juma Khan ana his party will obey the orders of the Political Agent, which would exclude Juma Khan and his party from Kharan and Afghanistan or from going west of a line pass ing North and South of Patkok (30.0.B.3). 5 /—5# As the I rani eh OoYernment have been infonned that Juma Khan and his iranediate adherents would be excluded from the whole of the Ghagai Agency, vide para 2 of frovernmont of India f s Express Letter No*F.505-M/38 dated the 20th February 1939, I have felt it necessary to refer '-V the solution now recommended by the Political A^ent for the orders of the Government of India, 6. I have interviewed Sardar Juma Khan and suggested to him that he should make a settlement with the Iranian Government; so that he might be able to return to Iran# He replied that this was quite out of the question since he could place no reliance on any promises made to him by that Government and wo aid certainly be killed if he was stupid enough to olace himself in their power® The whole party are now completely destitute and it is impossible for them to maintain themselves in Ctaetta without financial assistance from Government, no funds for which ere available with me. Presumably their situation would be no better if they were sent down to India and JL am therefore constrained to agreo with the Political Agent, Chagai that the best solution is to allow the 3ardar and his followers to live in the Chngai area proposed by him provided that the Sanjersni Sardar gives satisfactory security for their good behaviour, 7.

The M.F.A. of the Imperial Gorernment presents its compliments to E.B.M.Legation and has the honour to state that, according to a report received, a certain Navazan, after commit ting murder and robbery, fled to the Dashtyari mountains with his band. As this person, besides perpetrating these crimes, refused to hand over his arms, he was pursued by the Amnieh officials (road guards). On the 25/3/1318 (16/6/1939) he fled with his party from a placed called Sharek into British Baluchis tan. As failure to inflict punishment on such persons will encourage others to commit similar crimes, and will inevitably jeopardise the peace of the frontier, in which both parties are interested, the M.F.A., while transmitting herewith a list giving the names of those who fled with Navazam, requests that step* may be taken for the extradition of these persons, or, if extra dition is not found possible, that some action may be taken to ensure that these malefactors should be deported from the borders into the interior of British Baluchistan. It is requested that H.B.M. Legation may inform this Ministry of the result of the steps taken in the matter. Sealed . A.*Ho.:6’.296-H/39.

They stated that they had fled from their homes in Dizzak area in order to escape the harsh treatment of Iranian officials. They were disarmed and have been allowed to remain in Mekran for the present. As they cannot furnish security 'Rachalkas: (personal bonds) are being taken from them that they will commit no offence in Iranian territory. No subsistence has been given them and they will be encouraged to go back. 2. It is believed that the Iranian Nizamis had a clash with the Durrazai tribe and were worsted.

After defeat by Iranian troops Sardar Juma Khan with brother, nephew, woman-folk and others (mostly v o..*en end children) X0 crossed into India. Total number yet traced is about 140 persons. A son of Juma Khan with ten men is believed to have reached Eobpt. M ,r ny of women and children belong to families of which the men are still in Iran. All are destitute. 3. Information about Ismailzai is to be found in Hutchinson’i Report, on 3&amp;rhad, sent to Government of India under this Administration^ letter No.2144-0, dated tne 23rd December 1919. It will be seen from account given at peg*- 40 that strength of tribe ( including attached sections) was then estimated at about 400 families. It is now reported to have increased, bat estimates differ widely and are not to be trusted. It is in any case unlikely that nomad tribe of such United resources would in modern conditions increase to any /extent. Its armament is poor, and consists ot about 500 riiles of inferior type. Sardar Juma Khar., it will be noted, was of our creation. It is reported that he ksl has increased his Influence in past 20 years and is now acknowledged by whole trib as jardar. Tjjjibe is closely connected with lanjerani of Oha^yii, and some of attached sections are to be found in koh-i-Pusht and Koh-i-Julian areas of (Shagsi Agency. There are a small number of Xamailzai serving in Chagai Levy Corps. Tribe has for many years abstained from raiding into Indian territory and 1ms been friendly disposed. This attitude is probably due to desire to have possible asylum in its struggle with the Iranian Government during Great War at any rate its attitude ms unsatisfactory and it is clear that we are under no obligation to it for anything it did for us then. 4. Friendly attitude of lamailzai has undouotedly beenof £ value to us maintaining peace of this f rentier, and may be so again. This md its connections with ia± (Ihagai Agency are arguments in favour of treating trice gonoi^ously. Sanjerani S&amp;rdar has indeed offered to settle xeiugees in 3ha ci and be responsible for their good behaviour. But since 191 - nature of our relations with iram nac envi aiy chfUigeG, j it is not conceivable tnat we anouid retum uo policy, inherited from Oriental dovemments that we superseded of maintaining refugees from territory of neiidito tring countries for use against them in case of need. In my o in ion therefore we cannot allow our friendly feelings towards tribe to inter- ferejvith correctness of our relations with Iran ’j-overnment. 5. It is report'fed that any large iiamigraticn, of the tribe into India is not now to be expected. The Iranians arc said to have appointed another Sardar in Juma ’ a lace. It is not yet possible to estimate whether thtn* s xlifdit will have, lessened his influence with vrip, which probably in any case wou d be unwilling to cut itself oil entirely iron; its home in Iran. If it is only a problem of the disposal of Juma Khan and a few of his near followers, it shou d not oe hard to solve. Proposal to settle refugees in Chagai does not appear practicable. For one thing, 30 near to frontier, tney wouxd constitute threat to Iranian bevemment tbrt we could not countenance; for another there is no land in -hag^i that would giyr theta enoufdi for their support and we snouid tocome responsi tie for their maintenance, daiwerani uardar has ii. iact made i is offer dependent cn G-overrusent help. It is inadvisable also on general grounds to add to number of our pensioners. 6. I therefore propose following action:- juras. Khan and immediate adherents - four or ive men and their families - should be informed that they will be allowed to stay in rush id ( but not west of it) for six months cr so to give them chance orf coming to terns with Iranian 0-ov nationt. H they fail they will be excluded from vdiole of CSaa.gai Agency and, of course, hh&amp;r&amp;n and westeni portion of /\&amp;lEt btat e, and Government will give them no sort of help, monetary or other, during their stay in Hushki they will oo given some help for maintenance, not in shape of fixed monthly allowance, lest it should tend to became permanent, but by casual dele, the remainder should be allowed to stay in Ohagai Agency east of Dalbandin end should be encouraged by every means to repatriate themselves ....C,i~s&gt; the- sel^a. Being unimportant and having relations still in Iran they iffill, I think, be able to do so without much difficulty. Some small assistance should also be given to them but n.t a enough to make their life easy. For these grants and incidental expanses of evacuation ate. I request sanction to spend to Hs.5*000/-. 7. At s ime time 1 urge that, as eomplemanI try aeasare, strongest pressure should be brought to oear on Iranian Government to make such terms with all the ruiugtes as would t allow them to return. iVe are being put to v.-ry great incon- venience by their policy towards tribes of Sarhcid and their inefficiency in carrying it out.No.177.

Date 4th December, 1938, (13th Azar, 1317). Very Urr:ent. Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to bring the following matter to Your Excellency's notice:- A rebel(malefactor) known as Juma Ismailzai has for some time past been engaged in rebellion in the district of Kerman. Steps were lately taken by the officials of the Lashgars of the district to suppress this person and his followers. As a result, on the 2nd Azar, (23rd November, 1938), he crossed (the frontier) by way of (the) Shavru (Shuri Rud), which lies 12 kilometres north of Zahidan, and entered British Baluchistan at Piran and Mugh (Bug?) accompanied by 82 persons, of whom 69 were women and children The party has apparently been moved from that region, in the company of a British officer to Buyurcheh, 36 kilometres from the Iranian frontier. On the 7th instant (28th November,1938), Jalal, the son of Juma referred to above, killed a soldier, took away his arms, and later joined his father in British Baluchistan. As the finding of shelter by malefactors encourages criminals, is incompatible with neighbourly relations, and might jeopardise the tranquillity of the frontier, I have the honour to request that Y.S. will be so good as to take steps for the extradition (istirdad) of those male factors, who have committed c imes, and to inform me of the result. I have/iks add, in the meantime, that on the 6th Azar, (27th November) the British Vice-Consul at Zahidan was supplied by a representative of the 8th Lashgar and by the Ustandar with information concerning the xaxxs movementt^of the above named rebel (?Juma ?

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Note No.43804/3851 of the 4th December, (13th Azar, 1317), in which Your Excellency requested me to take steps for extradition of certain persons who have recently entered British Baluchistan. 2. It will be recollected that on October 10th, 1936, (18th Mehr, 1315), His Majesty's Legation hajs the honour to make to the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs a verbal communication with regard to the position of the government of India in these matters. The measures taken by the authorities in British Baluchistan to assist the Iranian authorites were set forth in that communication, but it was explained that it is not possible for the Government of India to extradite any particular individual. 3. I therefore regret that I am unable to do more than to convey ih to the Government of India, for their information, the request t made in Your Excellency's Note under reference. In view, however, of the policy consistently maintained by the Government of India in these matters, as fully explained in the communication to which I have referred, I cannot hold out any hope that they will be prepared to modify their attitude in the present case. 4.

My Lord Marquess, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lord ship’s confidential despatch No.F .505-N/38 of the 29th December last,in which you requested that pressure should be brought to bear on the Iranian G-overnment to make such terms with Jurae Khan Ismailzai and his followers as would allow them to return to Iran. 2. Your Lordship will by now have received my despatch No.177 of the 8th December in which I had the honour to report that the Iranian G-overnment had su gg ested that Juma Khan and his followers should be extradited from British Baluchistan. In view of this request, and its refusal on account of the inability of the Govt, of India to consider the extradition of any individual from terri tory under their control, I consider that it would be anexpedient to urge the Iranian Government to make terms with Juma Khan on the lines suggested by the Baluchistan Administration. If any such suggestion were made, the Iranian Government might well reply that if the Baluchistan Idminsitration are anxious to be rid of the fugitive^their simplest course would be to accede to the Iranian Government’s request for their extradition. 3 . I therefore venture to suggest that no approach to the Iranian Government should be made at present, and that Junra Khan and his followers should be dealt with as suggested in paragraph 6 of the letter under reference from the Baluchistan Administration t 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan at Meshed. I have, etc., Sd. H. J. Seymour.

Juma Khan was informed of the Government of India r s orders on the 17th March 1939. He and his followers numbering 165, including women and children, propose to cross into Afghanistan at Nilaf (34 C- D 2) on the 5th April 1939. They are proceeding at their own risk and no arrangement has been made with the Afghan authorities to hand them over. 3.

Further raids by Ismailzais coupled with the lack of success that attended the scheme for enlisting them in the Roadguards have at long last brought the expected retribution. On November 15th a military force of some 3000 men attacked and surrounded Juma Khan in the hills near Shoru. After holding out for 9 days Juma Khan with some fifty followers and numerous women and children made g'lod his escape to British territory . A detailed account of the operations prepared by His Majesty’s Vice Consul, Zahidan, forms an appendix to this report. Sartip Syed Mahmud Amini, the Divisional Commander, accompanied by the Governor General left Zahidan for Shoru on the 15th to direct operations. They returned to Zahidan on the 25th, too late to intercept Juma Khan and verbally requested His Majesty’s Vice Consul to allow them to follow him across the border.Juiaa lamiiilaai and hig tribesmen ng in Afghanistan, the K&amp;inat, HarmaaiUr and leki territory for the last nine years* /&amp;x*ious efforts hove heen i^ade by Uartip Taj i^ichah, late Ck&gt;vernor-Genax^l of -vU^ran,®olonel Mukri the present iovornor-Gonere1 ana uartip ii&amp;hmud Aami, the i^iviaionul Gomaiider, to persuade Jum Khan to give up his anti-government policy and live a life of peace but none of theia iiaa met with success. Gosie five months ago Abdullah, the son of Juma Khan ana bO of his tribesmen were enlisted in the local road-guards but this experiment also proved a failure as Abdullah ana the majority of the men asserted with their arms and ammunition after a very short perioa of service. The Iranians also offered Juma Khan rials ibOG/- per month as a tribal allowance if he would keep the peace but he has never accepted the money. 2 * The Governor-General and the Divisional Commander both affirm that Juma Khan has sworn an oath on the Quran that he would never raid again but this la a highly unlikely story as popular belief is that Juma Khan, although an outlaw, is a man of his word. *wo or three of the leading ^ardara, who are hostile to Juma Khan, have also promised to arrest him but he was always too wily to be caught napping* As all these efforts proved fruitless the ahah decided to order the army to attack Juma Khan and to arrest him.

The request was naturally refused but the Governor General wag assured that the authorities in British Baluchistan had been informed of the situation by telegram.

It is believed that during the operations 4 Ismallsals were killed while the Iranian force suffered approximately 60 casualties# laost of whom were road guards* 7.

Reference your Express Letter No. 420-S dated 20th July 1938. 2. I have gone personally into this question during my last visit to Owadur. The British /igent states that he issued Certificates of Identity to the men in question only after makir^; careful enquiries in each individual case as to the man’s place of origin and satisfying himself that the statements made by them were correct. 3. It is to be remarked that there is nothing to show from the papers enclosed with your Express letter under reference that the men concerned ever stated to the Karachi Police that they were not from the places as mentioned in their respective Certificates of Identity or in fact ever declitred that they were Iranian subjects. It is quite possible, I think, that the Karachi Police may have concluded that the places of origin as mentioned in the Certificates of Identity were in Iranian Mekran, where as of course with the exception of those from Cwadur and Karachi the places of origina were all in British Mekran i.e. Kallat State. 4. I am personally convinced that the British Agent at Gwadur is exercising the utmost care in ascertaining the nationalities of all the Balochis who ask for travel documents to India. This is supported by an incident which occurred recently, I ms approached informally by an Official of the Muscat Government with a request that I should, if possible ...possible, permit the regulations in force at (Twadur regarding the issue of Certificates of Identity, to be relaxed. The jdcx reason for making this reque st, it was stated, ms that owing to the very strict way the British ilgent was enforc ing regulations and refusing Certificates of Identity to all people \shom he suspected of being Iranian subjects, large number of Iranians, who previously used to come to riwadur and embark thence for India, had no* taken to going elsewhere owing to their inability to obtain travel documents at Gf-wadur. As a consequence, this Official stated, an appreciable loss accrued to the Muscat State from taxes on goods imported by such travellers. The position ms explained to the Muscat State Official. 5. It is of course quite possible that the British %ent in spite of all his care in such matters is occasionally deceived by false statements of Balochis coming to his office and this is not to be wondered at as the resemblance of all men of this race to one another in features, dress, and speech loakes it almost impossible to determine whether they are from Iranian or British Mekran. But I certainly do not think that more than 2 or 3 of the mn given in the list as purporting to be Iranians were infact of that nationality. 6. Previously a common subterfuge was for Iranian refugees to travel on Certificates of Identity illegaly sold to them by British subjects to whom they had been issued. This was only possible because hitherto it had been customary to dispense with the photograph^ of the individual required by regulations owing to the irapossibility of such an article being obtained on account of there being no photographer in Gwadur. I have now bean able to rectify this defect and have arranged for a local shopkeeper to take the necessary photographs. It should thus be possible to check at the ports of entry into India whether travellers in possession of Certificates of Identity are in fact the persons to whom they were actually issued.a jafe ; B. 351. At a meeting called at the Zahidan club on December 9th Sartip Amini, the Divisional Commander is believed to have publicly contradicted the rumour that Juma Khan had received British assistance and to have stated that none of the captured rifles were of British make nor did any Baluchis from India take any part in the recent operations.^fn any farther communication on this subject, please quote •‘Or No E.~71?2J&gt;/4-0^/3 an address—«&lt;?/ any person by name, but to—/ V “ Tire Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. rNDIA DIRECT + f i THE Under-Seoretary of State for Foreign Affairs plesents his yb- f r\ t - *' T compliments to J 4**-^ J n^v^ct 6 and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.No. 388.

Monsieur 1© Ministre* I have the honour to bring the following matter to Your Kxeellency’s note©:- A rebel (malefactor) known ao Juma lamailzai has for some time past been engaged in rebellion in the district of Kerman. Step® were lately taken by the officials of the b n shgars of the district to suppress this person and hio followers. As a result* on the 2nd Azar, (23rd November t 1938), he crossed (the frontier) by way of (the) Shavru (Shari Kud), which lies 13 kilometres north of Sahidan, and entered British Baluchistan at piran and MUgh (Bug ?), accompanied by 82 persons* of whom 69 were women and children. Yhe party has apparently been moved from that region, in the company of a British officer to Buyuroheh, 36 kilometres fro® the Iranian frontier. On the 7th instant (23th Hovember, 1938), Jalal* the son of Juma referred to above* killed a soldier* took away his arms* and later joined his father in British Baluchistan. As the finding of shelter by malefactors encourages criminals, is incompatible with neighbourly relations, and might jeopardise the tranquillity of the frontier, I have the honour to request that Y.3. will be so good as to take steps for the extradition (istirdftd) of those malefactors, who have committed crimes* and to inform me of the result. I have to add, in the meantime, that on the 6th Azar, (27th November) the Britisn Vice-Consul at Sahidan was supplied by a representative of the 8th hashgar and by the Ustandar with information concerning the movements of the above named rebel ( 7 Juma 7 Jalal).2 I avail myself etc (%d) Itusftffar A’lamt (Translated by J.p.G.

I have no information as yet to indicate whetiAer the British Agent’s added watcnfuiness naa been at all successful in checking the influx of Iranian refugees. But however careful he may be f it is in practice very difficult for him to distinguish, in the great majority of cases, between inhabitants of Iranian and British Mekran. 4. Consequently it appears to me that tue only effective means of preventing the further inflow of refugees from Tr] Iranian Mekran would be-temporarily at all events- to refuse to all Mekranis* including British Mekranis, any documents which would authorise them to travel to Karachi, and only to issue such documents to bona fide Indian traders, and Muscat subjects whose nationality was beyond dispute. 5.

This is confirmed by information given to the Oriental Secre tary at this Legation by an Indian derk named Wanis Ali, now serving at Kerman, but formerly employed at Gwadur. This clerk told Mr. Trott that it was extremely hard for the British Agent to check the certificates produced by Baluchis to show that they were British subjects, and that there is little doubt that many of those obtaining passes are Iranian subjects. 4. In the circumstances it is difficult to suggest an effective remedy for the existing situation. .An attempt might perhaps be made to devise means for exercising at Gwadur a stricter check on the issue of passes into India. But I realise that in practice it may prove very difficult to do this. It may be hoped that the trouble will be checked by the very process which is its cause, namely the steadily grow ing power of the central Iranian Government in Mekran. The refugees areclearly seeking to escape the westernizing changes under construction can hardly fail to increase the control of the central Government. 5.

During the last part of January about 40 Iranian families have migrated to Mekran to escape the new orders of the Iranian Government in the matters of compulsory aduattion and enlistment and cutting women’s hair, which have caused a considerable migration to Karachi also. The intnigrants are unarmed. It is believed that a clash with Iranian forces took place - vide paragraphs 125, 179 and 292 of the current Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau’s Summary «* in Iranian territory. Mir Mohamad Shah (Malik Shah Khan of the Summary) is in Turbat. He is related to Sardar Bahadur Sardor Mahrab Khan Gitchki and security luu been taken from him and the other refugees for their gpod behaviour. 2. This is obviously not a case in which we should bring any pressure to bear on the refugses to return to Iran, but their presence in increasing number is bound to cause inconvenience and friction, if not expense, and it would seem advisable that the Iranian Government should be pressed to come to a settlement with their subjects.In any further communication on this subject, please quote N °- r ni. j / wli / and address —not to any person by name, but to^A “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Would you kindly refer to Tehran despatch iMo. 192 to the Viceroy, and connected correspondence about the Perso- Dalachistan frontier.'' We have been discussing this matter with the Foreign Office, and it has been suggested that it might be inadvisable for butler to lay too much stress on the absence of an extradition treaty in any communication ' he may make to the Persians. It is of course the case, for the reasons given in the Government of India’s telegram of 17th July^No. 1749,Ahat an extradition arrangement with the Persians is not practicable, but to stress unduly the absence of an extradition treaty might merely spur the Persiansto urge H.M.Gr. to arrange for au'ch a treaty to be negotiated. This i^ght lead to further fruitless argument. This is a small point, but one which is perhaps worth mentioning, lou will no doubt bear it in mind when replying to butler, if you have not already done so. in any case, we assume you will be sending us a copy of your reply 50;J6 5000 7 36Minute Paper. POLITICAL Department. Mr. Clauson, Mr. Lambert, Eastern Department, Foreign Office, rang me up about the papers at P.Z.6576/36. The Foreign Office are apparently doubtful as to the wisdom of making a communication to the Persian Government along the lines proposed by Mr. Butler in his Despatch to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the 7th August. They are airaid that if we ask the Persian Government not to put forward in the future any requests for extradition because no extradition treaty exists, we shall merely lay ourselves open to a reply suggesting that an extradition treaty should be concluded. This is obviously not in the Government of India’s interest as they are strongly opposed to the idea of an extradition treaty: principally, as far as I can see, because (1) it would be difficult to differentiate between the Persian and Afghan frontiers, and any extradition agreement as regards the latter is quite out of the question; and (2) because the Government of India have no extradition treaty with Kalat, which forms the larger part of the Perso-Indian frontier. The Foreign Office, therefore, would be glad of our observations with the idea of sending a word of advice Mi to Mr. Butler persuading him from the first part, at any rate, of his scheme.British Legation, OULHI3K. 7th August 1936. «~I have the honour to refer to my despatch \ T o.52 of the 2?th January regarding the position on the Baluchistan frontier.

In reply to requests for extradition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are invariably informed that in the absence of an extradition Treaty,the Government of India regret that they are unable to extradite deserter* or any other fugitives from Iranian Justice. Requests for the returi^ of stolen property and other complaints about frontier incidents are usually made far too late for any effective action to be possible,and in terms so vague that the persons implicated can rarely be traced or identified,though every effort is made by His Majesty’s Legation to impress on the Iranian Government the importance of prompt and detailed information. 3. The persistence of the Iranian Government in making requests for extradition is embarrassing both to His Majesty’s Legation and to His Majesty’s Consular officers since continued refusals make them appear unwilling to co-operate with the Iranian authorities. In March last I therefore suggested to ^( the Government of India (in my despatch No.62 of the 17th March,with the full text of which I do not think I need /trouble The Right Honourable, Anthony EdenH.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office.trouble you) that tho position should be orally restated in unmistakable terms to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,and that the Iranian Government should be requested to instruct the Governor-General of Mekran to desist from putting forward to His Majesty’s Viee-Consul at zahidan requests for extradition,while thQr might be informed that His Majesty’s Consular Officers would be glad to co-operate (a) by passing on to the haluchistan authorities any information brought to their notice about refugees and (b) in helping to meet any requests for the restora tion of stolen property. I have not yet learnt whether the Government of India concur in this course. 4. Meanwhile complaints of one kind or another continue. In particular the Iranian Government have recently complained that letters are being written to an Iranian tribal leader urging hirs to desert his allegiance and migrate to British Baluchistan. This allegation has apparently been reported to the Shah himselfl. From this fact and other indications I think there is reason to fear that the Iranian Government are planning a new campaign of complaints about the situation on the frontier against the arrival of His Majesty’s Minister. In these circumstances I think that it is very desirable that a ooraxaunicatlon on the lines suggested in my despatch to the Government of India under refer ence should be made,and in reporting the present position to the Government of India in the despatch of which I have the honour to enclose a copy,I have ventured to request that I may be informed of their views as soon as possible. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) Hevile Butler.—* - * * %*V +?**&amp;**&lt;? ■ • ■ ’&amp;, ’* -; J&gt;.' j'*-• , /'• A*r'*Z -~~ *. m '.r.~r.;i m.19% 'Trzpto/M) Copies to:- F.O.

Z* the 28th July Monsieur Ansarie t in conversation with Mr. Trott,again referred to this ease* He said that he had noted Mr. frott's remarks on the sub4eot« He eould f hoeeTer t she^r ^r. frott letters written by a certain Mir Jan Khan. He pointed to oi&lt;e such letter o^ his file,without inviting Ur. Tsott to read it. The signature,which Wt» frett could sesundoubtedly looked like w Mir Jan Khaa ,f followed by some wrds which taight have been 'Vakil i Duwom* (say Lanee- Corporal). Monsieur A-aarie repeated that the Trahan rvovera- ment had no doubt th»t tuere did exist such a person as Mir Jan Khan, and that this person had attempted to subvert Laahkar Khan. 3. Monsieur Ansario then went on to read to Mr. frett extracts from a letter from the Ministry of war,stating that a letter In much the saie terms had reesritly been written to the /■«*« His Sxoellenoy, The night Honourable, The Marquess of Linlithgow K.T..O.C.X.B. t etc., etc., etc., SIMLA.same Lsshksr ;ch&amp;a 0u»«ha4aai by Rabibullah Kharatil t d«8&amp;rloed as OoTsrAor of iCharaa in British B&amp;luohistan. This particular letter inrlted Leshkar khan to meet Habiaullah Kharani on the E6th of Hahi us $ani {equivalent to ^rul,y X6th 1936 if this year is meant), monsieur Ansarle stated that this report had been sent to the Shah uho had said that sotae tiue a^o *hen the tribes of British Baluchistan had wanted to take refuge in Iranian territory,they were not allowed to do so. His Majesty was therefore surprised that the good-neighbourly attitude of the Iranian authorities had thus been repaid by attempts on ths part of British officials to seduce Iranian subjects from their sllegl&amp;nee* Monsieur Ansarie was therefore instmioted to ask thst this matter should be wary carefully examined,and to enquire why sueh propaganda was being ooudueted. 4. Mr. Trott replied that he was qpite certain that there eould be no propaganda of the type suggested. It was possible thst some individuals on that wild frontier were intriguing €*mong themselves,but Monsieur ftniarle could be sure that there was no Government propaganda. Mr • frott added that he was very interested to hear that the Shah hac! said that when British tribes wanted to take refuge in Iran,they were not permitted to do so. Ho asked Monel our Ans&amp;rio if he could giro a.y details, such as the date of the occurrence. Monsieur Ansarie replied 'perhaps a year ago*, but Mr. frott felt little doubt that this was a mere ^iess f and that monsieur Ansarie had no idea to what the Shah was alluding* Monsieur Anearie promised to enquire and give Mr. Trott a«^y further details he could obtain, $• As it was clear that no further investigations could usefully be made into the two eases in which letters are said to have been written to lashkar Khan Inviting him to leave Iran without the production of the letters themselves,! have written to mnrnimir Ansarle asking him to furnish ms with the originalsof tho loiters la question* I have the Honour to enclose a copy of «y letter* It will be interesting to see whether the original letters 9 or eren oodles of then 0 are T»re£uce4* 6* I fear that this and other oonver sat ions with !»evisieur Ansar ie afford a one ground for suspecting that the Iranian Ministry of har.who are agaia in an ill huwour ,mny be intending to start another campaign of ooaplalnte about alleged frontier incidents* It would not be surprising if thegr were up to their old game of heaping up baseless allegations for concentrated use upon the arrival of His Majesty's nsw Minister* in these circumstances I thinh that it is desirable that the eoumunleatlon suggested in ^ despatch to• 62 of the 17th l &amp;roh should be made f and I would be very grateful if I might be informed Whether Your Hateelleney concurs in the action suggested in that despatch.

Cases of stolen camels * It appears that the military report these to the Governor ieneraljin Makran and to Tehran* The Governor General passes belated information to us and we invariably Inform Baluchis tm. The inforcaation given ue is more often than not insufficient, and reaches us much too late* Nevertheless in some cases camels have been recovered by the Baluchistan gf authorities and restored to the owners* I have never receivedany actaiowlert^raont of the*e friendly »eryice8 rendered. Infor«ation ,?riTeii Is generally merely x,o the effect that the camels were 'taken over the British frontier'. This frontier is some 550 miles in length and moreover it has heen found in some cases that the animals were really taken into Afghanistan. The military authorities apparently send periodical 'Reminders' to the Governor General who passes them to us. In the meantime the military reports* of many months previous* are received in Tehran and passed to the Ministry for Foreign affairs# who nroduce the matter de novel and in the form of a complaint* to our Legation* and onoe more the matter is referred to me by our Legation or to Baluchistan (Yi» the Government of India). The whole system, resulting from the devious and in-efficient methods of local Iranian officials (who foiling to maintain order in Iranian territory, excuse themselves to Headquarters by accusing us of lack of co-oper«tion) is becoming increasingly tedious to us, and must be equally troublesome to the Baluchistan authorities. I would beg to suggest that the Government of India might care to propose that it should be made clear to the Iranian Central authorities, that our Consular officers are prepared to co-operate with local officials* by passing on information to the authorities in Baluchistan* and that the latter continue to do their best to assist. We cannot undertake always to recover stolen camels in a vast desert country, and success^?, in any case, depends largely on accurate and speedy information being givengiven us f4nd this is generally not forthcoming* I would further be^ to suggest that the Iranians might be informed that we cannot, at Tehran, take cognisance of fchttEe petty cases, comr.on to all frontiers inhabited by nomads, and in addition to the assistance given by our Consuls »nd the Baluchistan authorities, our Legation cannot be expected to call for constant reports from the Consuls on such cases, or to refer to the Government of India for still further reference t?

POETICAL COMMIT Previous papers :■ 7Z ty'i '- Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. As the result of a conference in Zahidan which was called to consider measures for controlling the frontier, the Government of India put forward various suggestions (see the memorandum attached to Tehran Despatch at P.Z.4736/35) with a view to assisting the Persian Government. The Persian Government suggested various modifications of which the two most important were (a) a demand for extradition of ordinary criminals; and (b) a demand that the arms of refugees crossing the frontier into British territory should be permanently confiscated. The Government of India did not % see their way to meeting these requests, and the Persian Government have accordingly decided to shelve the whole matter as they apparently attach great/great importance to point (b). The absence of an agreement is not a matter ox great concern to the Government of India. The proposals were aimed primarily to meeti##; past complaints of the Persian Government and to assist in avoiding any incidents in future. In return the Government of India hoped that a more cordial understand ing might be brought into being between Persian military officials and our Consular Officers. This miJiU come about in the course Mr HkcUi ^./'x ffru* M &lt;aA~ ****** of time without any written agreement, and if so it will settle the matter automatically. nil* POLITICAL COMM1TTSH. 2 8 4PJ? 1936M A No. 52 (220/1/36) ; 'j p 1 7 i l c \ i \ l J2H—^ LJTTfi w 'w* .. t .

The attitude of the Iranian Government is discourteous, nevertheless it would appear advisable in our own interests not to pursue the matter as this course seems likely to avoid difficulties which might otherwise be incurred by tne Government of India as a result of carrying out some of their proposals. 3.

This is with the object of securing that Consul General should control correspondence on international matters arising on frontier. Such matters ordinarily x ec;u ir e reference to India or to you. and frequent changes of your.g oflicern at Zahidan render it und-eeirable that such matters should be dealt with by Vice Conou3u |J : (n* f.s. d.s*(f*) J.S* a«D• Sc u.s. P*S./• &amp; Q* )Mr. Clauson. The last submission is at P.Z.4911/35 (below the file cover). You will remember that it was proposed that the Minister at Tehran should address a note to the Persian Government in the terms of the memorandum at Flag 'C with the modifications suggested in Tehran telegram Ho. P12 setting out the measures which the Government of India are prepared to take in order to assist the Persians in dealing with the situation on the Perso-Baiuchistan frontier; and that the Persian Government would then reply to the Minister's note expressing concurrence and, possibly, gratitude. Mr. Knatchbull Hugessen now reports that the Persians have raised certain other points in regard to the Minister's draft note^(a)(b) and (c) in his telegram of 14th August below). Prima facie, point (a) seems to be quite harmless provided that it is understood that the Government of India could not accept responsibility for any individual armed refugee whoo t, succeeded in «i-luding the Indian Frontier posts. Point (b) also seems quite acceptable, but the Government of India will probably decide that they cannot accept point (c). The Persian Government could not, I think, be allowed to dictate which tribesmen should, or should not, be removed from the vicinity of the Frontier. They have already been informed that the Government of India could not undertake wholesale deportations of refugees to India. No action seems to be required here at this stage and we can await the Government of India's reply. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen seems to have taken the right line in his discussions with the Persians.bs\. i *** C 7.

On receipt of your telegram 1 communicated your views to Persian Government and on July 27th ggave Soheily draft^.of Prime Nmister^ amended as proposed in my telegram ho* 120. Persian Government have now raised following further points:- (a) In point 1 of my draft they ask for insertion after 'armed bands of refugees' of words 'or individual armed refugees'. (b) Point 3. If this could not be modified would Gov ernment of India agree first, that in cases where arms were declined to returning tribesmen Persian authorities should be notified of name of tribe, place of recrossing frontier, and any other particulars: secondly, in any ca-se where Indian authorities were in doubt whether hostilities were in progress would they consult Persian authorities before restoring arms? (c) Point 4, after 'specific tribal leaders' could words 'or other tribesmen' be inserted? Also could end of sentence be amended to read 'near frontier is considered by Persian Government to be potential source of embarrassment.'

Moreover it would clearly not always be possible for Indian authorities to judge of local situation in Persia and Baluchistan or of degree of embarrassment likely to be caused by any individual tribesmen without consulting Persian authorities and that in view of your declaration that it would be out of the question to allow armed rebels to re-cross and resume hostilities you would naturally be anxious to make certain that there was absolutely no risk in any case where arms were to be de clined. In fact it seemed to me that point 4 had been (gr, omit.; with this in mind. I agreed,however,to ask you if you were prepared to give some assurance in the sense desired (c) I agreed to pass on their request for insertion of words 'or other tribesmen'; as to amendment proposed at end of sentence I said I was certain you would not agree to sur render your initiative by undertaking always to act as re quested by Persian Government in every case but that it seem ed natural that in case of doubt Indian local authorities would consult Persian authorities (see also under (b) above). Persian Government also asked that in final paragraph words 'Persian Governors concerned' be substituted for 'Per sian authorities' in the two passages mentioned at end of paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 120. In agreeing to submit these proposed amendments (most of which do not seem to be of great importance) I said I deprecate ed tendency to criticise what was a genuine attempt on your part to be of assistance end that I strongly advised them to raise no further points but to see how the arrangement worked in prnctdcS' Repeated to Foreign Office No. 11 Saving,J«^» ;valton, Asq., 0«]B., M.G (E: 4589/24/34) Dear Via It on.

I must admit that if a 'demarcated” frontier means a frontier marked by boundary pillars, etc., on the ground itself, it might have been better if the phrase 'generally demarcated' useu in the third paragraph of the record of my conversation with Ala on April 26th had been avoided and a less categorical phrase, such as 'generally delimited”, used instead.

The Foreign Office telegraphed to the (r. z. sso 3/as) Minister at Tehran on 10th May, instructing him to negotiate with the Persians on the lines proposed in the Government of India’s telegram of 23rd April (P.Z. 2861/35) which we had supported in our letter of 3rd May to the Foreign Office (submitted at P.Z.%907/35). At the same time, however, the Foreign Office intimated demi-officially that they were not entirely happy as regardsYthe return of arms~fc) (r^d) ^ refugees from Persian territory... 2) tiU ^ cr* ^ CtrvViKi v. _ i On receipt of these instruction^^th^ Minister at Tehran ^h^roupon prepared a memorandum v/hich he handed to the Persians intimating the measures which the Government of/of India Yifere prepared to take to assist the Persian Government on the Baluchistan frontier. A copy of this memorandum is enclosed in Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen*s despatch of 16th May, at P.Z. 4736/35. The memorandum emphasised that the Persians could make an important contribution on their side by arranging for closer relations between the responsible Persian military authorities in the frontier area and the British Consular Officers, and intimated that the Persian proposal for frontier commissars was unacceptable to the Government of India. Further discussions then took place, in the course of which the Persians pressed (a) for a modification of the measures proposed by the Government of India so as to admit of the return to the Persian authorities of ordinary criminals who refuge in British territory though not, of course, of political refugees, and (b) for the permanent confiscation of arms of all refugees crossing the frontier into British territory. stated that their military authorities were as a general rule forbidden to communicate with Consuls and said that the channel of communication would therefore be between the Governor of Duzdab and the British Vice-Consul though in serious emergency the Military authorities would communicate with the Vice Consul direct. It appears, therefore, that the Persians have, in fact, agreed to useMinute Paper 2956 6000 7/:’4 our Consular Officers as the channel of correspondence in regard to frontier affairs and they seem to have abandoned entirely their proposal for frontier commissars. This is very satisfactory from our point of view (Tehran telegrams Nos. 211 and 212, P.Z. 4260/35). 3. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen then consulted the Government of India again to see whether they would be prepared to make any further concessions to the Persians on the queotion-s- ^/a ) —Bxt-rad i t ion^—and- X-b)—of arms-tn-refugee s, making it clear that the second point was the only one of importance. After consultation with Baluchistan, the Government of India have now telegraphed in reply to Tehran (P.Z. 4911/35) re~stating the reasons why they are unable to make any further advance on either of these points. It will be remembered that the question of the return of arms to refugees has already been carefully considered and that some of the difficulties involved vrere set out in our letter of 29th January last to the Foreign Office (P.Z. 568/35). Reference is also invited to paragraph 2 of the Minute at P.Z. 2907/35. The position is that^while the Government of India are unable to agree to the permanent confiscation of all arms surrendered by refugees they have undertaken not to restore arms to refugees who desire to return to Persia while hostilities against the Persian Government are still in progress, and that all questions of this nature will be decided on their merits-in the light of the situation prevailing at the time and in every case of importance, in close consultation with the Minister at Tehran. 4- As regards the negotiations with the Persians at Tehran/Tehran, the Government of India have agreed to the procedure suggested in Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen*s telegram No. 212 of 17th June, at P.Z. 4260/35, viz. that he should address a Note to the Persian Government in the terms of the memorandum enclosed in his despatch of 16th May (P.Z. 4736/35) with certain minor modifications^to which the Persians would reply, expressing concurrence and, it is hoped, gratitude. Mr. Knatchbull-Huggesen has made it quite clear that the proposed measures are a matter of Indian internal administration and not of negotiation, and the Persians have apparently admitted this. There seems to be quite a reasonable chance that an amicable settlement will now be reached with the Persians on these lines. No action appears to be required at this end unless some further hitch occurs. 5T A separate submission will be made regarding the question of the demarcation of the northern sector of the perso-Baluchistan frontier mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Minute at P.Z. 2907/35 on which we have now received a despatch from the Government of India. ^ *1- if tvti, u, 3 /.« »», ^ CrU.

During the last 3 years no criminals have been sent back from Baluchistan to Persia, Government of India feel strongly that, in the absence of an Extradition Treaty and also because establishment of precedent of extradition, even in special individual cases, might seriously prejudice their policy on Afghan frontier, they cannot agree to give Persia any indication that they would be prepared to extradite fugitives, even on criminal charges.

[E 3440/24/34] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—{Received June 3.) (No. 212 .) Sir, Tehran, May 16, 1935. I HAVE the honour to inform you that on receipt of your telegram No. JL13 of the 10 th May I approached the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to opening the discussions concerning measures to be taken on the Baluchi frontier. It so happens that General Jehanbani is absent from Tehran for the next few days and the conversations cannot, therefore, take place until next week. In the meanwhile I thought it advisable to communicate to M. Soheily, who is now in charge of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the absence at Geneva of M. Kazemi, a memorandum which I had drawn Up explaining the position of tne Government of India and indicating the measures which they are prepared to take. I enclose a copy of this memorandum which is based upon the information contained in recent telegrams. 2. In handing this memorandum to M. Soheily I drew his attention to the concluding passage in which the view is expressed that in return for the measures proposed by the Government of India the Iranian Government should make a contribution on their side especially by arranging for closer relations between the responsible military authorities in the frontier area and British consular officers. I stated that unless the Iranian Government were able to meet the views of the Government of India in this matter it was unlikely that the Government of India w T ould be prepared to carry out the suggestions outlined in the memo randum and I further indicated that in any case the Government of India would be unable to go beyond these measures. 3. I then said that I thought the opportunity favourable for reviewing the general position of the relations between the Government of India and the Govern ment of Iran and I emphasised my desire to see the various outstanding questions settled. 4. M. Soheily at once informed me that he had, shortly before my visit, given instructions for a reply to be sent to me agreeing to the appointment of Captain Woods-Ballard to Bushire. This note has since reached me and I have informed you of this acceptance in my telegram No. lSL.of to-day’s date. I expressed great satisfaction and stated that the action of the Iranian Government in this matter would create a favourable impression. 5. I then called his attention again to the concluding part of the enclosed memorandum and expressed the hope that the necessary instructions would be given to the Iranian military authorities. M. Soheily enquired whether the Iranian proposal for frontier commissars was definitely^ rejected by the Govern ment of India. I stated this was the case, that the Government of India found it unacceptable and impracticable, and I intimated that it would be of no advantage To pursue the matter. His Excellency seemed to accept this, and I trust that in the forthcoming conversations it may be possible to induce the Iranian Govern ment to allow normal inter-communications between the military authorities and His Majesty's consular officers in Eastern Iran. I expressed to him the opinion that much of the recent misunderstanding had been due to the absence of these normal inter-communications. 6 . I then reverted to the case of Mrs. Hart and the Indian lorry drivers and stated that in neither of these cases had replies been sent to the requests for compensation and damages. As regards the case of the claim of Mrs. Hart, M. Soheily repeated to me what had been said by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 4th May, namely, that the Iranian Government were willing to pay the losses and expenses incurred, but in principle were opposed to accepting the claim for compensation. He said that I should shortly receive a reply in this sense. I answered, as I had to M. Kazemi on the 4th May, that I feared this [440 c—3]2 would not satisfy His Majesty’s Government and the , G °J® r T n “ e ?‘ Mrs. Hart was still suffering from the effects of her wound and I understood that further medical treatment would be necessary foi her , &amp; i-.1 oenses the Iranian Government could do would be 0 pay all incurred and, as regards the sum for compensation, I feared that if t e Iranian Government did not pay it by amicable arrangement with me, I should, m du course, be instructed to put it forward officially as a claim against them. O receipt of their promised note I will report further on this matter. 7 Finally I pressed that further delay should be avoided in settling the claim for compensation in the matter of the Indian lorry drivers killed and wounded in the district of Khwash (see my telegram No. 143 of the 9th Apnl, 1935). M. Soheily, who agreed that a settlement was overdue, took a note and promised to do what he could to expedite the mattei. 8 Before leaving I reiterated my anxiety to see these questions satisfac torily disposed of as I felt certain that the removal of these contentious matters could not fail to benefit the general relations between the Government ot India and the Iranian Government. „ 9 . I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the roieigu Secretary to the Government of India (No. 95). I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure. M emorandum. THE difficulties arising from local conditions on the frontier between Iran and British Baluchistan have been explained to the Iranian authorities; these are due to the great length of the frontier, which is over 500 miles long, is mostly uninhabited, and over which control by means of a few necessarily scattered frontier posts is inevitably difficult to maintain. The authorities of the Government of India consider, in fact, that this frontier presents conditions which are materially different from those elsewhere, where their sources of information and means of control are considerably more effective. The Government of India feel, of course, that it is impossible to deny refuge to tribal leaders and bands who seek it; on the other hand they agree that it would be out of the question to allow armed rebels to recross the frontier to resume operations against Iran. The following proposals embody the measures which the Government of India have adopted or are prepared to adopt to meet the situation which has been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Minister by the Iranian authorities :— 1. Armed bands of refugees from Iranian territory are, and will continue to be, disarmed and required to furnish security for their good behaviour. This measure is already in operation. 2. Any arms found in the possession of such refugees which are proved to have been stolen from the Iranian armed forces will be returned to the Iranian authorities. This measure is also in operation. 3. The arms of refugees will not be restored to them should they desire to return to Iran while hostilities against the Imperial Iranian Government are in progress. Formal orders to this effect are being issued. 4. The British authorities are prepared to remove from the vicinity of the frontier any specific tribal leaders whose presence near the frontier might be an embarrassment to the Imperial Government. This measure has already been applied in the case of Ahmed Khan, who has removed to Nushki during the recent conversations at Zahedan, but it is not yet in general operation. The Government of India are prepared to apply it with regard to individuals, if the Iranian Government so desire, but could not, of course, undertake wholesale deportations of refugees to India.o tj 5. The Government of India would be prepared to proclaim to the Baluchi tribesmen in British territory that any form of assistance to or intrigues with Iranian Baluchi tribes in revolt against Iran—a friendly neighbouring Power— will be severely dealt with. 6 . All levies employed near the frontier shall at all times be in uniform. Orders to this effect have already been issued. 7. The Government of India are prepared to order that British levy patrols shall not, except in cases of emergency, patrol up to the full limits of the frontier. The object of this would be to minimise the danger of clashes with the Iranian patrols which are understood to adopt a similar procedure. It should be understood in this connexion that the word “ frontier ” is used to signify the frontier as recognised locally. 8 . The Government of India are prepared to arrange that the majority of the personnel of British frontier levy posts shall consist of men from tribes other than those of the locality in which the posts are situated and that the commanders of these posts shall not be men of such local tribes. To supplement these measures, the British authorities feel that on the Iranian side a most important contribution should be made by arranging for closer relations between the responsible Iranian military authorities in the frontier area and the British consular officers, and by ensuring that very early information of frontier incidents requiring action on the part of the British authorities be given to consular officers. In this connexion His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Government of India have carefully examined the suggestion put forward at Zahedan by the Iranian authorities for the institution of frontier commissars. They regret that they find this proposal not only unacceptable but impracticable for the following reasons :— (a) It would be impossible to select headquarters for such an official which would be climatically suitable for all-year residence. (b) The frontier is too long to be entrusted to one official. (c) The district between Nushki and Mirjawa consists of several hundreds of miles of almost uninhabited territory. It would be impracticable to station an officer of the status of frontier commissar close enough to the frontier on the Indian side to enable him to co-operate and communicate satisfactorily with an Iranian frontier officer. (d) It would mean the substitution of a system which for the above reasons is unworkable for a system which has been proved to work in all other countries with complete success. It would also conduce to confusion and overlapping with the consular officers. The authorities in British Baluchistan are convinced that no other effective channel exists for communication of complaints and requests for co-operation than that between the Iranian military authorities and the British consular officers. The latter are selected for their local experience, are easy of access and are able to communicate rapidly with any British authority concerned. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of tndia are convinced that the establishment of close communications between the Iranian military authorities and the British consular officers is one of the most important factors in removing the difficulties to which attention has been called.

Further discussion has taken place on basis of memorandum enclosed in my despatch. Persians have raised the two following points: (a) paragraph 2 of memorandum 1st half of sentence. They admit in the case of ordinary migrations or political refugees this is unobjectionable but contend that in the case of criminals it is undesirable that this principle should become known and ask that in such cases return of criminals should not be excluded. They admit that in certain cases criminals are in fact already returned. I pointed out that my memorandum was in no sense intended for publication but only as a statement of our proposals for discussion with their delegates and suggested that if in practice criminals were already in many cases returned their objection need not be pressed. I made it clear that extradition treaty was impossible. Persian delegates agreed and suggested that when conversations were concluded I should address note to them stating exactly what Government of India were prepared to do and that this not*should omit this passage 0 (b) 2nd half of 2nd paragraph. Persians contend that this conflicts with point 5 of my memorandum2 . memorandum in wnich Indian authorities declare intention of allowing armed refugees to return in peace time. I pointed out that measures indicated in parts 1,2,5, coupled with declaration in 2nd half of 2nd paragraph made situation pretty water-tight. Indian authorities undertook only to allow refugees to return carrying arms which belonged to them if they were satisfied that there was no danger of dis turbance of the peace. In this Indian authorities were under taking a considerable responsibility and would, in their own interests be most careful to ensure that return was only allowed in complete absence of suspicion. Persian authorities could I supposed always intimate that suspicion existed. Persians replied that it would be necessary to guard against apparent innocence of return of refugees who would collect in the course of time and resume fighting. Gould we not agree to disarm all refugees completely and not restore arms at all? They presumed, that arms could be confiscated as contraband. I said we could not undertake to disarm all tribesmen whom Persians were unable to disarm themselves. But I undertook to enquire of you whether anything could be done on lines 01 confiscation as contraband. I understand that prohibition of import of arms is not enforceable in district in question, also that in practice measures already proposed will make return of armed tribesmen so rare as to be almost excluded. uut I snould be grateful for your views and if confiscation as contraband is impossible I should like to be able to explain objections thereto and to know how far I can go in reassuring x ersian G-overnment that cases of armed refugees being allowed to return should in practice be negligible. AsAs to last part of my memorandum Persian representatives stated that Persian military authorities are as a general rule forbidden to communicate with consuls. Channel of communication would therefore be between Governor of Dusdap and Vice Consul there though in serious emergency military authorities would communicate with him direct.

Ala, the Persian Minister in London, and Mr. Bennett of the Foreign Office on the 24th April 1935. 2. It appears that both M.

The position is that only a small section in the middle from Boundary Pillar Ho.l (near Kuhak) to Boundary Pillar Ho. 11 (near Gorani) has been demarcated, leaving two long undemarcated sectors both north and south. As regards the northern undelimited sector from Koh-i-Malik Siah to Boundary Pillar No. 11, I am to invite a reference to my official letter No.D. 20a0-V35, dated the 10th May 19 35, and the papers forwarded therewith, which will show that not only has the Iran•Baluchistan frontier not been demarcated in,in this sector, hut for the reasons stated the Government of India have no desire to promote this demarcation at the present juncture* To J.

Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 23.) (No. 155.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch to the Viceroy of India on the subject of proposed introduction of Frontier Commissar system on Perso-Baluchistan frontier. Tehran, April 6, 1935. Enclosure in No. 1. (N 71) Snatch bull-Hngessen to Lord Willing don. My Lord, Tehran, April 6. 1935. IN consequence of the proposal put forward by the Iranian delegates at the recent conference at Zahedan between representatives of the Iranian Government and of British authorities that a system of Frontier Commissars be established on the Irano-Baluchistan frontier (see paragraph 3 of Government of India telegram of the 20th March. No. 727 to Baluchistan, repeated to me as No. 33). I have caused a review to be made of the situation existing on the common frontiers of Iran and her other neighbours :— (1) The position on the Afghan frontier was dealt with in Colonel Daly’s secret despatch No. 52 of the 1st March to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. (2) The position on the Iraq frontier is well described in a recent despatch / (No. 108 of the 25th February) from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, of which I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy.^) (3) The situation on the Turkish frontier appears to be as follows': The Iranians have special Commissars who deal with frontier questions; the Turks have not, but make use of their ordinary local authorities (presumably military and police). Nothing is dealt with by any Turkish consuls, and if there is any question of serious complaint, the matter has to be taken up by the Turkish Embassy at Tehran with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In a recent conversation with a member of my staff the counsellor of the Turkish Embassy said that the Turkish authorities were constantly experiencing minor difficulties, such as thefts of camels, on the Iianian frontier, and that in the two years he had spent in Iran the only reply that the Government ever returned to complaints was that the lurkish officials were entirely in the wrong and the Iranians entirely in the right. Perhaps his most illuminating remark was: at ^ doesn t really matter in the least what the system is Nothing can function unless people show goodwill in trying- to work it. - &amp; (4) I have no information as to the nature of the system in force on the f r l ? n ^ er - ^he reports which constantly reach me of the flight of refugees from Russia into Iran and, up to'1933 at least continued reports of armed incursions of Russians into Iranian territory, suggest that, whatever the system in force, it is not vieldins- * D Not printed. [390 z—2]good results. I am, however, asking His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorasan and His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz to furnish me with reports on the method by which disputes on the Soviet frontier are settled. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch, without its enclosure, to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (No. 155), and to His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorasan (No. 34) and His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz (No. 10).

Please see the minute at P.Z.2451/35 submitting the report on the Zahidan conference. It will be remembered that, since the Persians have now stated categorically that all accusations against the British authorities have been dropped, H.M.*8 Minister at Tehran has agreed provisionally to further discussions at Tehran between himself and the Military Attach^ on the one side and representatives of the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and General Jehanbani on the other. It will also be remembered that the Minister telegraphed to the Government of India asking whether there were any further proposals which might be put to the Persians besides those contained in Appendix D (flagged) to the Report on the Conference (p.Z.2394/35) and that the Government of India replied (p.Z.2451/35) that they were consulting Baluchistan, but that it was unlikely that they would be able to go beyond the proposals mentioned in Appendix D to the Report. These proposals were mentioned orally to the Persian delegates at the Conference, but were not formally communicated to them in writing in view of their refusal to retract their accusations against the British authorities. 2. The Government of India have now telegraphed restating in detail their views and recommendations (Government of Indians telegram No. 1036 of 23rd April at P.Z.2861/35). They confirm their acceptance of proposals 1 to 8 of Appendix D (flagged) to the Report (the ninth proposal is for the Persians to implement), and it will be seen that some of these proposals have already been acted upon by the Government of India while orders have been issued in respect of certain others. The Government of India also JP«f(Part 4 of their 2956 6000 734 telegram/telegram) their rejection of the proposal made by the Persian delegates at the Conference (No.l of Appendix E (flagged) to the Report) for the institution of a Commissar system on the Perso-Baluch frontier. The objections to this proposal, which seem quite decisive, are discussed in the minutes at P.Z.2451/35. With regard to the second Persian proposal (No.2 of Appendix E) on the subject of the return of arms to refugees who cross the frontier into British territory, the Government of India adhere to the position approved in our telegram of February 2nd at P.Z.643/35, viz, they undertake not to restore arms to refugees who desire to return to Persia while hostilities against the Persian Government are still in progress (this goes a long way to meet the Persians); they are unable^to agree to the permanent confiscation of all arms surrendered by refugees, but all questions of this nature will be decided on their merits in the light of the situation prevailing in Persian Baluchistan at the time and,in every case of any importance, in close * consultation with the Minister at Tehran. Finally, the Government of India consider that the Persian proposal Jjo. 3 of Appendix E) for the removal from the frontier of all such refugees as may be notified by the Persian Government is too sweeping, but they have agreed (No.4 of Appendix D) to remove from the vicinity of the frontier any specific tribal leaders whose presence there might be an embarrassment to the Persian Government. 3. With reference to the undemarcated portion of the frontier mentioned in Part 3 of the Government of India’s telegram, the position is that the northern part of the Perso-Baluch frontier is governed by the Holdi^ch Agreement of 1396, which defined the frontier by a verbal description and by a line drawn on a map attached to the Agreement/ *• ^ 2? -ifr fa g£ r.Z. rtt/ssrMinute Paper Department, Agreement. Unfortunately the map was inaccurate V J and for a distance of about 50 miles the verbal description of the frontier given in the Agreement and the line drawn on the map attached thereto do not tally, so that the Agreement is open in respect of this area to several varying interpretations. The Government of India state that they have decided that it is not in their interests to propose demarcation and that they consider that the matter should be left dormant as long as possible. They promise/^ to develop their views on this subject by despatch. 4. The Government of India recommend that the Minister at Tehran should now be instructed to negotiate with the Persian Government on the basis of the proposals mentioned in paragraph 2 above and it is submittedthat we may inform the Foreign Office that we support their views. The Government of India emphasise that they are unable to go beyond these proposals and hope that the Persian Government will recognise the sincerity of the Government of Indian desire to assist them and, on their side, adopt a more accommodating attitude towards certain cases in respect of which we have made representations to them. The Government of India mention in particular the Hart case and the case of the Indian lorry-drivers in respect of which claims for compensation have been submitted to the Persian Government. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted accordingly. V J 2956 6000 7 34Draft Paper. p.z. 2907 / 35 . Department. immediate. u.s.s., . 1 w ^ n P.O.

The Persian Minister cam Bennett on the 26th and mentioned a report which had appeared in the ''Times” on the 25th April, headed 'India frontier problems' and dealing, inter alia with the Baluchistan frontier discussions which are about to be resumed at Tehran. He explained that he had strict instructions to report on the accuracy of all references to Persia appearing in the British press, and that as the statement in the report that the 'question is 'complicated by an undemarcated frontier, which involves 'rights of jurisdiction between the two countries' has struck him as being of doubtful accuracy, he wished to ascertain the views of the Foreign Office before reporting it. 2. Sterndale Bennett asked me for my views before J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E replying./replying. My recollection of the Baluchistan frontier problem was that though there might be points on the frontier, as actually observed between Pillar 11 and Kuh-i-Malik Siah, at which it was doubtful whether the Holditch agreement was being correctly interpreted, these elements of doubt could have nothing to do with the major frontier problems now under discussion, and in fact nothing to do .with any of these problems except that of clashes between patrols. Moreover, I had recently read the Government of India’s telegram No. 1036 of the 23rd April, in which they said that they were anxious that the question of frontier rectification should remain dormant. In these circumstances I had no hesitation in suggesting that the reply to Ala should be to the effect that the statement that the frontier question was complicated by uncertainty as to the frontier was an inaccurate one about which he need not bother his head. Ala seemed relieved to hear this (though he also seemed unaware of the fact that his Government had themselves asked for a frontier/frontier survey in 1932) and I hope we shall hear no more of the guestion. 3« The statement in the ’'Times' report may of course have referred to the part of the frontier south of Pillar 1, which, though laid down in maps and notes in 1870 - 1872, was not demarcated in 1896, as the northern sector was. But I do not remember hearing that uncertainty as to the frontier has ever heen the cause of difficulties in this sector in recent years, and I presume that the Government of India do not v/ish the line of the frontier in any .y sector to he revised.*PM o&gt; o V FCN/AT?, (129 groups) * ~~ i Q ■ - - 1 ^ ' 2227, DSCYPHEB OF TELflORA Prom Government of India* Foreign and political Department* to (COPIES Secretary of State for India* CIRCULATED) Dated Simla* 23rd April* 1935, Received 23rd April, 1935* 12*30 p,m 0 1036* First of Five parts * Addressed to Secretary of State for India and repeated to Minister at Tehran, 50, and copy hy mail to Baluchistan and Consul-General, Khorasan* Minister at Tehran telegram of April 9th, 96, repeated to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, as 143, and previous correspondence* Baluchistan - Iran frontier* 2* w« havt nor examined carefully, in consultation with Baluchistan, proceedings of Zahidan conference and are satisfied that failure to produce any useful result was mainly due to attitude of Iran representatives who, being of insufficient status to take any responsibility* concentrated on accusations of past misdeeds instead of upon concerted measures of co-operation for the future* However, (vide Tehran telegram Ho.126, dated April 3rd) Iranian Government have definitely agreed to drop all accusations and concentrate on the future* We agree that Minister should resume negotiations in the manner proposed by him and agreed to by Persians* 3 e We would, therefore, recommend that Minister be now instructed to negotiate with Iranian Government on the following lines.SECRET CW/STP/AWc (104 groups) 2228, D g C Y P H K R 0 R T a ,L IS G B A M a From Government of India, Foreign and political Department, to Secretary (COPIES of State for India.

POLITICAL COMMITTER Z 5 APR 1955 Previous papers :— 3330 1000 12.34 '• Please see the previous minute at P.Z.1426/35, describing the circumstances in which the Zahidan conference broke up without any agreement being reached. Z. We have now received via Tehran a detailed report on the conference (?.Z.2386/35) and some interesting additional information is contained in the d.o. letter of 27th February from Mr. Skrine, the Political Agent, Kalat and Chagai, at Flag A. The report on the conference with its appendices is a somewhat bulky document, but a convenient summary of the report, together with the comments thereon of the Minister at Tehran, is contained in Tehran telegrams Nos.81-84 at P.Z.1817/35. It will be seen that since the Persian delegates refused to let bygones be bygones and declined to sign a documentMmmmmmmmmam—amm \ acknowledging the good intentions of the British Government and accepting the assurance of the British delegates that responsible British authorities were not implicated in any of the incidents which had formed the subject of Persian accusations, the British delegates on their side rightly declined to communicate to the Persians on paper the 9 suggestions enumerated in Appendix D of the Report for measures to improve the position on the frontier, which the Government of India had been ready to offer to the Persians. The Persian delegates also declared that these 9 suggestions (which were put to them orally by the British delegates) were inadequate anu put forward 3 additional proposals contained in Appendix E ol the Report, the most important of which is a proposal for the institution of a Commissar system on the Perso—Baluch frontier. There was a marked contrast between the attitude oi the Persians at the meetings of the conference and in private conversation. It appears indeed that personal relations between the Persian and British delegates were extremely cordial, but that the former were afraid to adopt a reasonable attitude oiiicially for fear that this might get them into trouble with their higher authorities at Tehran. 3 With regard to the Persian proposal for the institution of a frontier Commissar system, Mr. Skrine promised at the conference to submit the question to the Government of India but held out little hope ol its being accepted; at the same time he pointed out some of the obvious objections to the Commissar system and also explained the difficulties which the Government of India would have in accepting the other two Persian proposals (see page 9 of the Report at Flag B). In connection with the frontier Commissar proposal, reference is invited to the very interesting letter of 1st March from the Consul-General in Khorasan at P.Z.2252/35, 4 where Colonel Daly suggests that the real reason of the Persians X J-C If ^ fc’Minute Paper Department. in putting forward this proposal is their desire to reduce still further the influence of our consular officers* A great deal of the recent trouble on the Perso-Baluch frontier has been due to the fact that the Persians have deliberately avoided submitting their complaints locally to Colonel Daly or to the Vice-Consul at Zahidan and have preferred to make them the subject of diplomatic representations at Tehran. By the institution of a Commissar system the Persians would be able to cut out the British consular officers altogether and to obtain their desiderata without the necessity for having recourse to the good offices of these officers. Colonel Daly also explains that we may expect to continue to receive frequent appeals from the Persians in respect of incidents on the Perso-Baluch frontier, while we on our side very rarely need to apply for assistance to the Persians, so that a Commissar system would be of no advantage to India but only to Persia. It would clearly be impossible to work a Commissar system satisfactorily on the Perso-Baluch frontier where the boundary runs through very large tracts of almost uninhabited territory. The Government of India have provisionally expressed the opinion that the Persian proposal is entirely unacceptable ! only for the reasons given at the conference by Mr. Skrine but also for these geographical reasons, and the A.G.G., Baluchistan, has expressed his entire agreement with this opinion. On the question of the policy now to be adopted vis-a-vis the Persian Government in regard to Baluchistan 1rontier incidents, it will be seen from Mr.Knatchbull— Hugessen’s telegrams Nos.82 and 83 of 12th March (P.Z.1817/35) that on receiving the report on the Zahidan conference/ 2956 6000 7 34conference, the Minister adaressed a firmly worded letter to the Persian Prime Minister protesting against the attitude adopted by the Persian aelegates at the conference and stating that he was prepared to continue discussions at Tehran but only on condition that Persian accusations were dropped once and for all. Peroughi has replied somewhat evasively to this letter, but Mr.Knatchbull- Hugessen has now elicited from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs a further categorical statement that all * Persian accusations have indeed been dropped. The IS fr or. v-726 | ( P/1 - W -4 ) British Minister has therefore agreed to further discussions v-y26 with the Persians and it has been provisionally settled that these discussions should be held by the Minister and the Military Attache with representatives of the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and with General Jehanbani. The latter at any rate appears to be a reasonable person and he is still grateful for certain assistance rendered to him by the British authorities when he was in command of the Persian troops in Baluchistan during the 1928 revolt, There therefore seems some hope that an agreement may result from these discussions if the Persian Government really desire to reach an amicable settlement. They have everything to gain and nothing to lose by adopting a conciliatory attitude. From the second last paragraph of Mr. Skrine’s d.o. letter already referred to at Flag A, it will be seen that Feroughi’s contention that 'a state of mind exists among the Baluchis which leads them to suppose r that they enjoy British sympathy' 1 has not in the past been | entirely without some foundation.The correg) onhence goes to th&amp;t tnere may have been more substance in the Persian complaints than we were at one time inclined to imagine, on the other hand the local representatives oi the Persian Government have adopted a very unreasonable attitude - no aoubt from a uesire to appear zealously national in the eyes of the Central Authorities. The proposals put forward by Mr. Skrine and summarised in Appendix D would, if accepted, go very far to meet any legitimate complaints on the part of the Persians. The supplementary proposal made by the Persian delegates tnat a system of commissars should be established is open to the objections stated by Mr.Skrine. (the mere fact that such a system would reduce the local influence of our consular officers is not, I think, a decisive argument, though Colonel Daly naturally attaches much importance to it). On tne other hand, the Central Government have repeated tnat tney ao not in any way doubt our bona fiaes . ana, as the Government of India point out in their latest telegram, it looks as trough they definitely appreciated that it was to their interest to obtain assistance from us on this question, ana it is to be hoped in these circumstances that an amicable agreement on the basis of the proposals summarised in Appendix D to tne Heport may be reached. There seems no objection to endeavouring to use our readiness to comply with tne Persian requests to secure satisfaction in the Hart case, and possibly compensation for the Indian killed and wounded in the Sarhad, as now suggested by the Government of India. But even if these questions have to continue to be dealt with separately, there is much to be said from our side.( 114 groups 0 ) DECYPHER OP TELEGRAM, Prom (COPIES CIRCULATED) Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, repeating telegram to Tehran 0 Dated Hew Delhi, 6th April, 1935 Received 11 aom„, 6th April, 1935 0 XXX in 906, Addressed to Tehran, 4£, repeated to Secretary of State for India and Khorasan, 906 o Your telegram of the 3rd instant, 87 a We have not yet received Baluchistan^ assurance that they con or are willing to implement the proposals contained in Appendix D to Daly ? s Report, and it seems unlikely that they could in any case go beyond theme We have asked Baluchistan for their comments as soon as possible and will telegraph again on receipto 2o Meanwhile, it appears from the trend of your telegrams that, in spite of their attitude during the conference, Iranians are anxious to obtain assistance.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER CONFIDENTIAL. Section 5. [E 1978/24/34] No. 1. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 25.) gj r ^ % Tehran, March 9, 1935. ’ WITH reference to my telegram No. 7Qof the 26th February last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty s consul-general for Khorasan, enclosing a report on the discussions which have recently taken place at Zahedan in regard to the Baluchistan frontier, and also of a letter from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to one from Mr. Loxley suggesting that further discussions should be postponed until after my return to Tehran. 2. I have not yet had time to study the report with proper care, but I think it well to forward a copy to you without delay. I shall probably furnish you with my comments by telegraph shortly. . 3. A copy of this despatch ( without enclosure 1) is being sent to the loreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 4/). I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Daly to Mr. KnatchhulTHugessen. (No. 28 (1/24). Secret.) Sir, proceedings at the Zahedan conference. . 2. This report has been compiled by Major Pybus, in consultation with myself, and I am in entire agreement as to its contents. Mr. C. P. Skrine, I.C.S., in order to avoid being delayed a whole week at Zahedan, there being only one train weekly from Nok-Kundi, had perforce to leave before the report was completed. He, in consultation with Major Pybus and myself, was present when the draft notes were prepared, and expressed his concurrence. 3. There are two matters which the Government of India desired should be raised at the conference, i.e .:— (1) Possible delimitation of the frontier. (2) Claims to be submitted for injuries to the persons of certain British Indian subjects and material damage to their motor vehicles, which resulted from commandeering of the latter by the Persian military forces. 4. Neither of these matters were actually discussed at the conference. Mr. Skrine has undertaken to communicate with the Government of India as regards (1), and the reasons which led us to conclude that it would be inoppor tune to raise the matter of frontier delimitation. I shall shortly have the honour of addressing you further in respect of the action taken by me on point (2). 5. Copies of this despatch and the joint report are being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department; the Honourable the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan; and Mr. C. P. Skrine. I.C.S., Political Agent, Kalat. I have, &amp;c. C. K. DALY, Lieutenant-Colonel. [365 bb—5] B2 Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Report by the British Representatives at the Zahedan C onference. 1. Preparatory Steps. COLONEL DALY arrived in Zahedan on the 4th February and Major Pybu^ on the 7th February. Mr. Skrine did not arrive till the 15th February. While waiting for Mr. Skrine s arrival, Colonel Daly had two interesting interviews. The first was a call paid by a young major of the Persian Air force. He had been sent by the Inspector-General of the Persian Army (General Amanullah Mirza, Jehanbani) to convey his kind regards to and welcome Colonel Daly on his arrival. The general is at present engaged in a special mission in connexion with the disturbances in Persian Baluchistan. The major was friendly and communicative and, in the course of conversation, volunteered the statement that General Jehanbani was very displeased with the late Military Governor of Persian Baluchistan (Brigadier Abbas Khan Alburz) and considered that the brigadier’s treatment of the tribes had been tactless and barbarous and was the primary cause of the present unrest. # . This point is of interest in the light of subsequent discussions in the conference, when the chief Persian delegate hotly denied that Brigadier Alburz s actions had in any way contributed to the situation and challenged the right of the British delegates to make such a statement concerning the internal affairs of Persia. The second interview was with General Jehanbani, who asked Colonel Daly’s views as to (i) the composition of the Persian delegation, and (ii) the procedure to be adopted. Colonel Daly suggested that, in addition to the general himself it w T ould be advantageous for both sides if the newly appointed Military Governor (Brigadier Mehdi Quli Khan, Tajbaksh) could be present, since he would be chiefly concerned wdth implementing any agreement which the conference might reach on the subject of future co-operation. The general appeared to agree. 2. The Opening Session of the Conference. The opening session of the conference took place in General Jehanbani s residence at 6 p.m. on Saturday, the 16th February. The following were present: — General Jehanbani, Colonel H. Arfa and Captain Mustoufi, for the Persians, and Colonel Daly, Mr. Skrine and Major Pybus for the British. The general proceeded to read a short speech welcoming the delegates and expressing the hope that the conference would terminate satisfactorily. He then asked Colonel Arfa to read the remainder of this previously prepared document (attached as Appendix A to this report) somewhat naively styled a proces-verbal of the first day’s proceedings. This document is, in fact, a statement of the Persian case. It is exaggerated, one-sided and categorical. It prejudges matters which had not yet been discussed. The Persian delegates seemed bent on our accepting a copy of this document and expressed a desire that a resume should be compiled after the conclusion of each session. The British delegates hoped to achieve some useful result and to avoid acrimonious wrangling and mutual recriminations and thus accepted a copy of the document without comment though they did not fail to note that the ‘ ‘ throwing of light on recent incidents” received prominence and that even the briefest reference to future co-operation between the two Governments was conspicuous by its absence. 3. The Second Session. The second session was held in the British vice-consulate on Sunday, the 17th, at 10 a.m. The British delegates were surprised to note the absence of General Jehanbani. The Persian delegation was thus limited to Colonel Arfa and the captain, who never opened his mouth throughout the entire conference, and who seemed to be in the position of a confidential clerk in charge of the Persian delegates’ documents.3 When asked why General Jehanbani was absent, Colonel Arfa said that he was otherwise engaged, and further stated that, though the general had been present to open the conference, he was not a delegate thereto. The disappointment of the British delegates at this piece of news was P r0 “ found. The general is an old and personal friend of both Colonel Daly and -Jdr. Skrine, is an eminently sound and reasonable man, and his presence would undoubtedly have tended to elevate the subsequent discussions on to a highei plane. During the opening session, while Colonel Arfa was reading what the British delegates must persist in terming the list of indictments, the genera murmured to Colonel Daly in an aside that he was profoundly conscious of, and deeply grateful for, the unstinted help he had received, not only from Mr. Skrine in 1928, but from Colonel Daly in the years immediately following, and that he felt himself compelled to maintain silence rather than to associate himself with this stream of accusations. , In the opinion of the British delegates, this shows pretty clearly that the o-eneral knew that, in the eyes of the Persian Government, the past misdeeds of the British were to count for more than their future help in this conference, and that only by holding aloof from the conference could he preserve both his friend ship with the British and his reputation for loyalty with his own Government. As the statement of the Persian case referred to a number of fresh incidents (i.e., additional to those already furnished to the British Legation in Tehran prior to the conference), Colonel Daly suggested that the British delegates should discuss the original cases first before going on to the additional ones (see Tehran telegram No. 13 to Zabul, dated the 26th January, 1935). The first case was easily disposed of. The Persian delegation did not produce the author of the report. When asked to produce the letter, they stated that it may have been a message. The British delegates then stated that no such person as Daud Khan or Daud Shah or Dad Khan or Dad Shah was, or ever had been, employed in any capacity m any British consulate in East Persia. The Persian delegate stated that he did not propose to bring up case JNo. 2 of the original list, as the facts were too hazy. At this juncture the Persian delegate, doubtless feeling that matters were not going very well for his side, said that he had only brought up these two cases to show that a bad c ‘ atmosphere prevailed, and went on to quote examples of random utterances of stray British officials and private individuals in order to prove that the British were unfriendly to IPorsicL His examples were utterly irrelevant and had no reference to Baluchistan, but they are quoted in this report to illustrate the extreme sensitiveness of the Persian Government and the care with which the lightest word of a stray Englishman is collected as evidence of the ill will which his country bears to Persici Captain Eccles (sometime assistant military attache in Tehran and now deceased) is reported to have encountered a band of twenty forcibly-conscripted Gilani villagers being conducted to Resht by two Persian soldiers. Captain Eccles, it is alleged, taunted the conscripts with their lack of spirit in allowing themselves to be forcibly abducted by a party which they outnumbered by ten to one. . , A party of Anglo-Persian Oil Company employees, it was alleged, m the Mohammerah Club, had spoken in terms of the greatest disrespect of the Persian army, and had expressed the opinion that the sooner Khuzistan was handed over to the British the better it would be (convivial oilmen had better note that their barman is an agent of the Iranian Ogpu). Other examples were given, and the digression terminated, to the relief of the British delegates, who considered that, whatever the “ atmosphere ” in Persia might be, such statements by the Persian delegate were hardly calculated to improve the atmosphere of this particular conference. Subsequently the discussion reverted to the remaining cases brought up by the Persian delegate. A resume of these discussions is attached to this report as Appendix B. After the last of these cases had been concluded, the British dele gates desired to proceed with what they deemed the more important part of the conference, i.e., the discussion of measures of co-operation for the future. The Persian delegate stated that he was not empowered either to make any suggestion or to listen to any put forward by the British, but would require to refer the matter to higher authority. The conference then adjourned [365 bb—5] b 24 On the following morning the British delegates proceeded to make a resume of the session of the previous day, at the request of the Persian delegate. Ihis is attached to this report as Appendix B. 4. The Third Session. This resume was finished by the afternoon and the third session took place General Jehanbani's residence at 3 p.m. on Monday, the 18th February. At the request of the British delegates, General Jehanbani consented to be present at this session. Major Pybus read out a Persian translation of the resume (Appendix B), and gave an unsigned English copy to Colonel Arfa to serve him as an aide-memoire. At the conclusion of the previous session the British delegates realised that the conference was assuming the very form which His Majesty’s Minister had declared to the Persian Government to be utterly unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government, i.e., the arraignment of the British on a number of charges incapable, through lack of evidence, of being either proved or disproved. Accordingly, they asked for the general’s presence at the next session, and asked him in unequivocal terms whether he attached more importance to fruitless wrangling about past incidents or to the discussion of plans for the betterment of the future. He replied that he attached more importance to the latter and hoped that his reference of the matter to his Government in Tehran (made at Colonel Arfa’s request after the conclusion of the previous session) would elicit the required permission to proceed with the discussion of future measures. The conference then adjourned till the following day. 5. The Visit to the British Levy Post at Robat. On the morning of the 19th February, Mr. Skrine, Major Pybus, Colonel Arfa and Captain Mustoufi visited Robat post by car. The object of the visit was to enable Mr. Skrine to carry out a routine inspection of the post, to see the scene of some of the incidents mentioned in the Persian case, to make enquiries on the spot and as a gesture of co-operation with the Persian delegates. Colonel Daly did not accompany the party, as he judged it wiser policy to impress on the Persian delegates the fact that he was a British consular repre sentative in East Persia and. as such, not concerned with the British side of the border. 6. The Fourth Session. The fourth session was held in the British vice-consulate on Tuesday, the 19th February at 3 p.m. It was hoped by the British delegates that this session would be devoted to the less unpleasant and more profitable task of devising means for better relations in the future. The chagrin of the British delegates was then great when the Persian delegate stated that the British version of the resume of the proceedings of the 17th was unacceptable to him in the form in which he had read it. The British delegates stressed the fact that it was only given to him as an aide-memoire and was in no sense a joint report which they were asking him to sign, and pointed out that he could, of course, report anything he liked to his own Government. Even this was unacceptable to him, and he proceeded to waste five valuable hours in suggesting a host of alterations, amend ments and additions. The alterations and amendments had, as he plainly stated, as their object the removal of imagined slights to Persian national pride and supposed affronts to Persian national dignity. The additions were obviously inserted with a view to strengthening the Persian case and making their previous evidence more complete. In other words, the Persian delegate insisted on having the last word. To cite an example, the Persian delegate wished the word £C postponed ” to be used in place of “ withdrawn ” in the reference to case No. 1. When asked how any reasonable man could regard case No. 1 as anything but closed, he replied that perhaps they had misstated the name of the cc farrash ” and that subsequent enquiries might produce fresh evidence! The previous impression in the minds of the British delegates now became a certainty, that the main, if not the sole, object of the Persian Government wasI l 5 to produce a formidable list of accusations against the British, which, if unreiuted might be put to subsequent use as a stick with which to beat the British, -^ot wishing to wreck the conference over this, they agreed to make certain changes in the wording of the resume, and it was recast in the form it now takes as appendix C to this report. conference was drifting towards an impasse, they appealed to the Persian delegate to concentrate on the future and not on the past. Colone! Arfa then stated that British diplomacy consisted of “ give and take, but that Persia, recovering slowly from years of humiliation, oppression and exploitation by more powerful neighbours, had so much lee-way to make up that she could afford to give nothing, and that it would take years of giving on our part, and taking on hers, to redress the adverse balance. After this digression the British delegates asked Colonel Arfa to make his suggestions for the improvement of our relations and to state what practical form the assistance offered by the Government of India should take. This well-meaning utterance had a most alarming effect, and Colonel Arfa treated the British delegates to yet another display of nationalism run riot, in which he said that, thanks to God and His Imperial Majesty, Persia stood in no need of any foreign assistance whatever. After this ebullition of national pride, he reverted to the matter in hand and said that he would prefer to hear the British delegates’ suggestions first. The British delegates—perhaps in too forthcoming a manner—but not wishing to spare any effort in achieving the object of the conference, proceeded to enumerate and explain the measures they proposed to recommend to the Govern ment of India, with a view to effecting closer co-operation between the two Governments. These are contained in Appendix D. After these suggestions had been enumerated, the British delegates hoped that Colonel Arfa would express the gratitude of his Government and admit the goodwill which the British thus showed in tangible form. He did no such thing, and merely remarked that they were insufficient and represented only the bare due which Persia had the right to expect from a friendly Power acting with C£ bon-voisinage.” He then made the modifications contained in Appendix E, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. In reply to 1, Mr. Skrine promised to submit the point to the Government ! of India for their consideration, but gave the Persian delegate little hope of its 1 being accepted. There were many drawbacks, Mr. Skrine said; firstly, it meant I the abolition of a proved system working in all other countries with complete success. Secondly, such an appointment would lead to considerable overlapping between the frontier commissar and the nearest consular authority. Thirdly, it was difficult to select a headquarters for this official which could be climatically suitable for all the year round residence. Fourthly, the frontier from Kuh-i- Malik Siah to the Persian Gulf was too lengthy a strip to entrust to the keeping of one official. As regards point 2, Mr. Skrine pointed out that this idea was not wholly acceptable to the Government of India and that the Persian Government were virtually asking the Government of India to disarm on their behalf the tribes they themselves were unable to disarm. Point 3, Mr. Skrine said, might lead to serious financial obligations of the I Government of India. Refugees were not left to starve, and if a whole tribe decided to cross into British Baluchistan their transportation and feeding would lay an intolerable and unjust burden on the Indian taxpayer. The conference then adjourned till 5 p.m. on the following day. 7. Review of their Position by the British Delegates prior to the Final Session. Taking stock of their position at this stage, the British delegates realised that, in addition to harping on the past, the Persian delegate was not unmindful of the future, and that his cool and ungrateful reception of their suggestions was an ordinary oriental gambit to conceal the importance with which he regarded them. They also realised, as will be seen from the conclusions they drew at the close of the conference, that co-operation and liaison were not wanted by the Persians. What they desired were promises by the Government of India to do certain things —all for the benefit of Persia—in return for which the Government of India would get nothing from Persia.6 The Persian aims were therefore threefold viz., to maintain “ u “l e ^ condition their charge-sheet against the British, to g e &amp; j an( j British Government of India, and to prevent liaison between then officials ana bii consuls by substituting the frontier commissar system. threefold viz The British aims, as understood by the delegates, w ere also t &gt; firstly, to dispel, once and for all, in the minds of the Persian Governme absurd suspicions of British sympathy with and complicity in Ae rec disturbances in Persian Baluchistan; secondly to demonstrate our § 0011 ^ 111 ^ offering to make certain suggestions to the Government of Ind a • o frontier administration; and, thirdly to try and foster better relations and closer liaison between Persian officials and British consuls The British delegate thought that the reconciliation of these partially conflicting meress was impossible. Persia wanted the Government of India to do ’ L lt of which the Government of India were prepared to do. possibly follow later when the Persian Government were told—as the delegates believed they would be told-that the Government of India not change the existing system and create frontier commissars^ There remained the totally conflicting views of both sides as to the past. The B ^tt- thought, therefore, that they would be disobeying the instructions of Maiesty's Government and would place that Government in an awkward pred ca- ment if they failed to get a written acquittal of those charges as an essential preliminary to making or asking the Government of India to make concessions and promises for the future. 8. The Fifth Session. The fifth session took place in General Jehanbani’s residence on Wednesday, the 20th February, at 5 p.m. , . The British delegates’ policy was to barter their list of suggestions (see Appendix D) for the written acquittal. They started by saying that the conference had produced some plain speaking on both sides, that the British good faith in the past must have been made clear, and as for the future their good intentions could not be in doubt. They considered, therefore, that further negotiations would be better conducted through diplomatic channels. The Persian defegate protested that to abandon the conference in that state was unwise, a,s no written record of its deliberations had been made. Could not he have the British suggestions in writing as regards the action which the Government of India would be asked to take? The British delegates replied that throughout the conference the chief aim of the Persian delegate had been to incriminate the British m past incidents. The role of an accused in the dock was one, they declared, they refused to play Firstly, when these allegations were originally made, Sir Reginald Hoare had made a strong dementi which had been accepted by the Persian Government. Secondly when they were resurrected, the present Minister had only agreed to the holding of a conference on the express understanding that all accusations were dropped Thirdly, it was unreasonable to ask for the co-operation of a nation and to accuse that nation of acts of hostility all in the same breath. Fourthly the explanations given by the British delegates must, surely have been sufficient to convince any reasonable man of their non-complicity m the acts with which they were charged They must insist, therefore, before proceeding further, on some statement to this effect by the Persian delegate as a sine qua non. Our proposals which he had heard on the day before were an earnest of our goodwill for the future. The Persian delegate replied that as an individual he might be prepared to give some such assurance, but that if, as an official, he did so in writing, he would be taken to task by his own Government, who would ask him on what grounds he convinced himself of British innocence. . £ , The British delegates suggested that they should help him to find a formula acceptable to both parties—a formula which would suit our purposes, and which would not lay any undue onus on him personally. To this he agreed with alacrity. After two hours’ discussion the formula to be found in Appendix E was evolved. This he was on the point of signing, but finally decided not to do so. The British delegates then stated that they were not prepared to go any further and that as Mr Skrine had to leave the next morning, and Colonel Daly and Major Py^ s proposed to leave also, the conference had better terminate. He implored the British delegates to continue the discussions and to let him have their suggestions (Appendix E) as a record. This they refused to do. He then stated that he would7 refer the matter to General Jehanbani (who was at Kwash) by telegraph. The sentence beginning ‘ ‘ accept the assurances of ’ ’ was the phrase he boggled at, and stated that a signed telegraphic message of assent from (General Jehanbani would absolve him from further responsibility. With regard to Colonel Arfa’s unwillingness to take the responsibility on his shoulders it is only fair to him to state that his position is somewhat peculiar. He is the son of an English mother and has an English wife and has resided in England. He gave the British delegates to understand that, even though his personal sympathies were with the British, his official sympathies must be against us; while any ordinary Persian must be intensively national in his outlook, it was vital for him to be a positive Anglophobe in order to preserve his position. If the British delegates would call early next morning they would hear his answer. The conference then adjourned at 9 -15 p.m. 9. The Sixth Session. On the next day Colonel Daly and Major Pybus called at Colonel Arfa’s house at 8 a.m. He said that the general could not sign the paper on the grounds that he had not seen it. The remaining British delegates stated again that in their belief any further discussions should be conducted through diplomatic channels. Colonel Arfa’s last remark was to the effect that if General Jehanbani had given his assent he would have signed the formula. As the particular sentence to which exception was taken had been copied out by Mr. Skrine the night before at Colonel Arfa’s request in order that he might refer the actual phrase to General Jehanbani, it was obvious that the refusal of either to take the responsibility of signing was a definite barrier to further progress. The conference then broke up and Colonel Daly and Major Pybus took their departure. G. D. PYBUS, Major, C. K. DALY, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache, Consul-General in Khorasan and Tehran.

Le General de Division Djehanbani souhaite la bienvenue aux representants britanniques, presente les membres de la Commission mixte les uns aux autres et emet le voeu que, grace a 1’esprit de bonne volonte et de collaboration cor diale qui semble regner parmi les membres de la commission, les travaux de la commis sion soient terminees d’une fa^on satisfaisante et la lumiere necessaire soit projetee sur les incidents de frontiere survenus dernierement, ainsi que sur les relations mutuelles des autorites et des tribus des deux cotes de la frontiere. II. — Memoire sur les incidents et la situation sur la frontiere presente par le Colonel A rfa. L’etude des dossiers concernant les actes de brigandage commis par les Baloutches des frontieres venus du territoire de I’lnde britannique et s’y r&amp;fugiant apres 1’execution de vols a main armee sur la grande route Mirdjave- Zahedan-Hormak, et le fait qu’aucune enquete ni poursuite n’a ete effectuee de 1’autre cote de la frontiere par les autorites de police locale (Chagai levies),Points (3) and (4). See below. Point (5). The statements of the Iranian gendarme and of the British levy were discussed, and the British delegates were of opinion that the statements were conflicting, but that, owing to certain aspects of the case, no blame could be attached to either side, and that the matter should be considered closed and regarded as a regrettable incident probably due to a misunderstanding on thpps part of both patrols. 3. The British delegation outlined and gave specific instances of the action taken in British territory with a view to discourage, and actively prevent, refugees from Iranian territory taking any part in hostile acts against the Iranian Government. 4. The Iranian delegates then gave details of a number of other cases which had caused difficulty to the Iranian authorities, of which three were cases of theft of animals alleged to have been carried across the British border, and four were cases of motor vehicles attacked during the past few months on the Zahedan- Mirjawa road, in which cases the tracks of the raiders were said to have been followed to the British border. There was no evidence of the nationality or identity of the culprits. It was understood to be the Iranian view that our levy posts were negligent in preventing raiders using British territory as a base or refuge. The British representatives drew attention to the difficulty of a few scattered posts in an extremely mountainous and almost uninhabited region effectively guarding their fiontiei from violation by armed bands engaged in a form of guerilla warfare, unfortunate lack of liaison between the responsible Iranian military officials and the British consular officers, which resulted in news of these incidents either not being brought to the notice of the latter at all, or after so great a delav as to render effective measures impossible. ^ ac ^^ on the above, the Iranian delegation brought forward the i olio wing cases of alleged moral or material support given to Iranian insurgents by British tribesmen or levies, viz. :— (1) That Ahmad, brother of Juma Khan Ismailzai, came to Kacha post with the avowed intention of crossing into Iran to help his brother, that nobody stopped him, and that he did cross the border with three rifles. ^j e T-? r ^ S tt Baluchistan delegate gave his version of the movements of Ahmad Khan. He admitted that Ahmad Khan had for some time been at Kacha undei sui veillance, following a period of some two years during which he had been on security near Dalbandin, over 200 miles from the horde? As he failed to produce adequate security for good behaviour while at Kacha, he was turned out of British territory and the Iranian Post Commander at Miriawah was informed. The subsequent movements of this person are not known ' Should he be discovered to have returned to British territory he will be removed to a safe distance from the frontier. „ ( 2 ) 11 was alleged that Bahroz Khan Kurd was sent to Ahmad Khan at Kacha to dissuade him fr*om joining the rebels, and that he was arrested bv the levies and kept twelve days under surveillance. The Baluchistan delegate gave the following explanation of this incident: Bahroz Khan and two others were sent by Sardar Habibulla Khan Reki with a letter for Ahmad Khan at Kacha asking him to return to Iranian territory. The frontier assistant, who was in the neighbourhood, heard of the mission, and, having had no previous intimation regarding it, suspected Ahmad Khan of intriguing with the rebels. He therefore ordered the post commander to arrest Bahroz Khan and his associates, and goino- himself to Kacha, interrogated Bahroz Khan and took possession of the lette? Bahroz Khan denied that he was on any official mission and said that his business was purely private. The men were retained at the post and the matter referred to higher authority for orders. Bahroz Khan was released within a few days g n vi 8 , Se ? ret mlssi0n ( which now tarns out to have been official Sardar Habibulla Reki being an officer of the Iranian forces) had entered our territory without credentials and without prior information having been given. This the Butish delegation pointed out to be contrary to international practice (3) It was alleged that Juma Khan captured an Iranian vakil (non commissioned officer) and a soldier and sent them in charge of an armed party to Kacha levy post with a request that they should be retained for some time and11 not allowed to give information to their superiors. The Jemadar in charge of the post is alleged to have returned Juma Khan’s men with a letter promising arms and ammunition. After nine days the soldiers were released, the non commissioned officer returning to Zahedan and the soldiers deserting to Afghanistan. ) 1 he Baluchistan delegate stated that nothing whatever was known of any such incident, but that he would make further enquiries. (4) that Jemadar Wazir Khan of Kacha post is alleged to have written to a friend in Zahedan asking him to endeavour to obtain the release of one Zaman Khan, said to be one of his men who had been sent on a mission to Juma Khan and had been arrested by the Iranians. 1 he information of the British Baluchistan delegate is that Zaman Khan is an Afghan subject, and that he is not connected in any way with the Kacha post. Further enquiries are, however, being made. (5) The same Baluch informant who was responsible for the story regarding the letter supposed to have been written by Dad Shah (see paragraph 1) had reported to the Iranian authorities regarding an incident alleged to have occurred when he was at Juma Khan’s headquarters collecting information for the military authorities. He said that five Baluchis had appeared before Juma Khan and told him that Haji Dadkhuda, Havildar of the British post at Robat, had intended to join Juma Khan with nine armed men including five Chagai levies. He would not, however, arrive as on the way he had fallen in with one Mulla Karim and had supported the latter in a skirmish with the Iranian troops at Shuru. The British delegation found themselves unable to accept this hearsay evi dence of a single Baluchi (named Sher Mohamed), who had reported the case previously mentioned of the consulate farrash’s letter and whose evidence was thus obviously quite unreliable. Moreover, the scene of the skirmish was some 40 miles from the Robat post and at least 30 miles inside Iranian territory, and it is incredible that a number of armed levies should have travelled such a distance from their post, joined in a fight and returned to their post without the fact being widely known on both sides of the border. Nor could the levies possibly be absent from their post for more than one or two days without the fact being known to the levy officer in charge of the sector and to our frontier assistant, who is in frequent telephonic communication with the post. (6) It is alleged that early in February two Mekrani Baluchis (Irani subjects) named Sarfaraz Khan and Isa Khan of Champ ran arms from Gwadur in Muscat territory across a strip of Kalat State into Persian Baluchistan, for the purpose of arming rebel tribesmen. This incident is of very recent occurrence and nothing is known to the Baluchistan delegate in the matter, but he has taken note and will institute enquiries. If the men named are found to have been engaged in any nefarious activities he will arrange for their removal or arrest. 6. The British delegation, having discussed at some length the above cases brought forward by the Iranian representatives, cannot but feel that friction could have been avoided and many of these cases satisfactorily dealt with in the ordinary course of routine had some form of liaison existed between the Iranian military and the British consular authorities. Having in mind that the object of this conference is to devise means of rendering the Imperial Government all reasonable assistance in maintaining order among their Baluch subjects, the British delegates desired to ascertain from the Iranian representatives what form their assistance should take. As Colonel Arfa stated that he was not empowered to offer any suggestions or to discuss any that might be put forward by the British delegates, the conference adjourned. c 2 [365 bb—5]Appendix C to Enclosure 2. Resume of Second Session of the Conference (as recast) February 17, 1935. Present: Major G. D. Pybus. Mr. C. P. Skrine. Colonel Arfa. Captain Mastofi. Lieutenant-Colonel C. K. Daly, C.I.E. The conference first discussed five matters which had been indicated at Tehran as for consideration, of which it will be noted that some were included in the cases brought forward by the Iranians, viz. :— (1) The allegation that a farrash of the British vice-consulate at Zahedan, named Dad Shah or Daud Shah, had written a letter to Sardar Juma Khan promising British support. (2) Juma Khan's brother, Ahmad Khan, had written a letter to the effect that he would endeavour to dissuade his brother from opposition to the Iranian Government only if a meeting could be held under the auspices of the British vice-consul. (3) Two border cases in which camels were stolen. (4) The alleged detention of an Iranian sarjuqeh (non-commissioned officer) and a soldier at Kacha levy post at the request of Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai. (5) An incident which occurred on the frontier in which one Iranian gendarme was wounded and a British levy killed. 2. As regards (1), the British delegates represented that no such person as Dad Shah or Daud Shah was, or had ever been, employed at any of their consulates in East Persia, and as the actual letter could not be produced, the matter was dropped. Note.— On the 20th February the Iranian delegates sent a note stating that the name of the person who was reputed to have written the letter to Juma Khan was Mahomed Shah and not Daud Shah, and that his name had been mistaken for that of Dad Shah by the Baluch informant. Point (2). The British delegates pointed out that their Government could not accept responsibility for anything that one Iranian subject might write to another. The Iranian delegates explained that they had brought up these first two points in order to show that a belief was widespread among the Baluch that they could rely on British sympathy. Points (3) and (4). See below. Point (5). The statements of the Iranian gendarme and of the British levy were discussed and the British delegates were of the opinion that the statements were conflicting, but that owing to certain aspects of the case no blame could be attached to either side, and that the matter should be considered closed and regarded as a regrettable incident probably due to a misunderstanding on the part of both patrols. The Iranian delegates maintained that the fact that the gendarme and soldier had been questioned separately immediately after the occurrence, and that the incident occurred well within the Iranian territory, proved the truth of the Iranian version. 3. The British delegation outlined and gave specific instances of the action taken in British territory with a view to discourage, and actively prevent, refugees from Iranian territory taking any part in hostile acts against the Iranian Government. 4. The Iranian delegates then gave details of a number of other cases of robberies on the Kurmuk-Mirjawa road, of which three were cases of theft of animals which were carried across the British border, and four were cases of attacks on motor vehicles, in which cases the tracks of the raiders had been followed to the British border. In one case of theft of camels, two robbers were identified as Khan Muhammad, son of Mangal Mirbolozai, and Ghulam Muhammad, nephew of the Qazi of Zahedan, both resident in British territory.13 It was understood to be the Iranian view that our levy posts were negligent in preventing raiders using British territory as a base or refuge. The British delegates pointed out that the mere fact that the tracks were followed to British territory does not prove that the robbers were resident in British territory. I he Iranian delegate then stated that, in one of the cases, he had personally satisfied himself that the tracks of the robbers had come from British territory. 1 he British representatives drew attention to the difficulty of a few scattered posts in an extremely mountainous and almost uninhabited region effectively guarding their frontier from violation by armed bands engaged in a form of guerilla warfare, and to the unfortunate lack of liaison between the responsible Iranian military officials and the British consular officers, which resulted in news of these incidents either not being brought to the notice of the latter at all, or after so great a delay as to render effective measures impossible. 5. In addition to the above, the Iranian delegation brought forward the following cases of alleged moral or material support given to Iranian insurgents by British tribesmen or levies, viz. :— (1) That Ahmad, brother of Juma Khan Ismailzai, came to Kacha post with the avowed intention of crossing into Iran to help his brother, that nobody stopped him, and that he did cross the border with three rifles. The British Baluchistan delegate gave his version of the movements of Ahmad Khan. He admitted that Ahmad Khan had for some time been at Kacha under surveillance, following a period of some two years, during which he had been on security near Dalbandin, over 200 miles from the border. As he failed to produce adequate security for good behaviour while at Kacha, he was turned out of British territory, and the Iranian post commander at Mirjawa was informed. The subsequent movements of this person are not known. Should he be discovered to have returned to British territory he will be removed to a safe distance from the frontier. Note. —On the night of the 18th February, 1935, news was received that Ahmad Khan had been arrested by the levies at Kacha post, on re-entering British territory a few days before. Orders were immediately issued that Ahmad Khan should be removed to Nushki. (2) The Iranian delegates stated that Bahroz Khan Kurd was sent to Ahmad Khan at Kacha to dissuade him from joining the rebels, and that he was arrested by the levies and kept twelve days under surveillance. The Baluchistan delegate gave the following explanation of this incident. Bahroz Khan and two others were sent by Sardar Habibullah Khan Reki with a letter for Ahmad Khan at Kacha asking him to return to Iranian territory. The frontier assistant, who was in the neighbourhood, heard of the mission, and, having had no previous intimation regarding it, suspected Ahmad Khan of intriguing with the rebels. He therefore ordered the post commander to arrest Bahroz Khan and his associates, and, going himself to Kacha, interrogated Bahroz Khan and took possession of the letter. Bahroz Khan denied that he was on any official mission, and said that his business was purely private. The men were retained at the post, and the matter referred to higher authorities for orders. Bahroz Khan was released within a few days, although this secret mission (which now turns out to have been officially inspired) had entered our territory without credentials and without prior information having been given. This the British delegation pointed out to be contrary to international practice. The Iranian delegate maintained the view that, as the letter was written by one Iranian subject to another, the sending of it was quite in order, and the arrest of Bahroz Khan and his associates was open to question. (3) It was stated that Juma Khan captured an Iranian Sarjuqeh (non-commissioned officer) and a soldier, and sent them in charge of an armed party to Kacha levy post, with a request that they should be retained for some time and not allowed to give information to their superiors. The Jemadar in charge of the post is alleged to have returned Juma Khan’s men with a letter promising arms and ammunition. After nine days the soldiers were released, the non-commissioned officer returning to Zahedan and the soldier deserting to Afghanistan on the advice of the Jemadar. The Baluchistan delegate stated that nothing whatever was known of any such incident, but that he would make further enquiries.&lt;1* 14 (4) That Jemadar Wazir Khan of Kacha post wrote to a friend in Zahedan asking him to endeavour to obtain the release of one Zaman Khan, said to be one of his men who had been sent on a mission to J uma Khan and had been arrested by the Iranians. The information of the British Baluchistan delegate is that Zaman Khan is an Afghan subject, and that he is not connected in any way with the Kacha post. Further enquiries are, however, being made. Note. —Jemadar Wazir Khan has since been examined and has categorically denied that either of these last two incidents ever took place The letter has been shown to the British delegates, who promise to compare the signature with that of Wazir Khan on other documents undoubtedly signed by him in the past. (5) The same Baluch informant who was responsible for the story regarding the letter supposed to have been written by Dad Shah (see paragraph 1) had reported to the Iranian authorities regarding an incident alleged to have occurred when he was at Juma Khan’s headquarters. He said that five Baluchis had appeared before Juma Khan and told him that Haji Dadkhuda, Havildar of the British post at Robat, had intended to join Juma Khan with nine armed men, including five Chagai levies. On the way he had fallen in with one Mulla Rahim, and had supported the latter in a skirmish with the Iranian troops at Shuru. The British delegation found themselves unable to accept this hearsay evidence of a single Baluch (named Sher Mohamed), who had reported the case previously mentioned of the consulate farrash’s letter, and whose evidence was thus obviously quite unreliable. Moreover, the scene of the skirmish was some 40 miles from the Robat post, and at least 30 miles inside Iranian territory, and it is incredible that a number of armed levies should have travelled such a distance from their post, joined in a fight and returned to their post without the fact being widely known on both sides of the border. Nor could the levies possibly be absent from their post for more than one or two days without the fact being known to the levy officer in charge of the sector, and to our frontier assistant, who is in frequent telephonic communication with the post. The Iranian delegates stated that the five witnesses had been identified. (6) It is alleged that, early in February, two Mekrani Baluchis (Irani subjects), named Sarfaraz Khan and Isa Khan of Champ, ran arms from Gwadur, in Muscat territory, across a strip of Kalat State, into Persian Baluchistan, for the purpose of arming rebel tribesmen. This incident is of very recent occurrence, and nothing is known to the Baluchistan delegate in the matter, but he has taken note and will institute enquiries. If the men named are found to have been engaged in any nefarious activities, he will arrange for their removal or arrest. 6. The British delegation having discussed at some length the above cases brought forward by the Iranian representatives, cannot but feel that friction could have been avoided, and many of these cases satisfactorily dealt with in the ordinary course of routine had some form of liaison existed between the Iranian military and the British consular authorities. Their instructions being that the main object of this conference is to co-operate with the Iranian Government and to devise means to prevent as far as possible the occurrence of such incidents. The British delegates desired to ascertain from the Iranian representatives what form this co-operation should take. Before proceeding to offer suggestions or to discuss those put forward by the British delegates, the Persian representative stated that he would like to refer the question to higher authority, and the conference adjourned till the next day.15 &lt; Appendix D to Enclosure 2. I he British delegation then put forward the following proposals :— (1) That armed bands of refugees from Iranian territory are, and will continue to be, disarmed and required to furnish security for their good behaviour. (2) 1 hat any arms found in the possession of such refugees which are proved to have been stolen from the Iranian armed forces will be returned to the Iranian authorities. (3) That the arms of refugees will not be restored to them should they desire I to return to Iran while hostilities against the Imperial Iranian Government are/ in progress. (4) that the British authorities would be prepared to remove from the vicinity of the frontier a ny speci fic trihaj fcndprs whose presence near the frontier might be an embarrassment to the Imperial Government. (5) That the British delegates are prepared to recommend to the Government of India that it be proclaimed to the Baluchi tribesmen in British territory that any form of assistance to, or intrigues with, Persian Baluchi tribes in revolt against Iran—a friendly neighbouring Power—would be severely dealt with. (6) That all levies employed near the frontier shall at all times be in uniform. (7) That British levy patrols shall not, except in cases of emergency, patrol up to the full limits of the frontier. The object of this is to minimise the occurrence of clashes with Persian patrols, which are understood to adopt a similar procedure. (8) That the majority of the personnel of British frontier levy posts shall consist of men from tribes other than those of the locality in which the posts are situated, and that the commanders of such posts shall not be men of such local tribes. (9) That arrangements should be made by the Iranian authorities for closer relations between the responsible military authorities in the frontier area and British consular officers, and that very early information of frontier incidents V* requiring any action on the part of the British authorities should be given to consular officers. Appendix E to Enclosure 2. Having presented the Iranian case, and having listened to and discussed fully the explanations given thereto by the British delegates, and having examined the British delegates’ proposals for better co-operation in future on the Indo- Iranian frontier, the Iranian delegates acknowledge the goodwill and intentions of the British Government and accept the assurances of the British delegation that responsible British authorities were not implicated in any of the incidents referred to in the Iranian delegates’ “ Resume du Proces-Verbal de la Premiere Seance.” They therefore recommend the acceptance of the British delegates’ proposals, with the following reservations :— a) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) The Persian delegates consider that a system of frontier commissars, similar to that in force on other frontiers of Iran, should replace the existing system whereby complaints regarding frontier incidents are referred to British consular authorities. The Persian delegates are unable to accept the Government of India’s proposal to hand back to refugees returning to Persia any arms or ammunition which may have been surrendered on entry into British territory. They consider that the Government of India should prevent such refugees carrying any arms or ammunition at all on re-entering Iranian territory. They further recommend that the Government of India should be requested for more effective co-operation in the prevention of the smuggling of arms and ammunition into Iranian territory. They consider that the Government of India should remove to a safe distance from the frontier not only individual leaders, but all such refugees as may be notified by the Iranian Government as undesirable. /i/d .

Although from the information which I have so far received it is gathered that due attention and care have unfortunately not been given to the proposals which have been made by the representatives of the Imperial Government with a view to the establishment of the means of removing anxiety and securing the frontier in those regions, and that the situation remains the same, without being regularised, I, in my turn, agree that discussions regarding the matter may be resumed on the return of his Excellency Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen.

The sole significance of these articles lies in the fact that they have passed the Censor, which means that to some extent they reflect the outlook of the Persian Government.

The paper strongly deprecates the statement in the ’’Times” that the Persian Baluchis rebellion against the Government has been actuated by their dissatisfaction and its attempt to show by this assertion, that a condition of rebellion exists in Baluchistan fed by a general discontent. The ’’Itela’at” accuses the Times of ill- will and malice by contrasting the above assertion with the fact that the Persian Government in its indefatigable efforts to create security and well-being all over the country, has, during this short period, had such an unparalleled success that it is now envied in this respect by very many countries. The paper states that dissatisfaction is the lot of the Baluchi brigands whom the ’’Times” presents to be the whole mass. The 'Itela f at” then refers to the conference at Zahedan, to which the ’’Times” has referred, stating that these measures were to check the activities of certain brigands who thought that they would be favoured by some frontier agents of the neighbouring country or could find refuge on the other side of the frontier and enjoy perfect security. Certain events, which the paper does not reveal here, it says, have strengthened these/these feelings among those mischievous hands and have made them holder than ever. A commission appointed with the concurrence of the Government at Zahedan was, therefore, to examine the recent events and adopt measures for avoiding their recurrence in the future.V UC. hS J. , r yv &gt; ^ S.Q^ f ido.ntial, ^ ^ V Copy of memorandum No. 135-S.C. ddted Sibi €He 2f3t February 1935, from the Hon'ble the A/ynt ‘tq t l^ J Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Belucnisban, to the Foreign Secrete.ry to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Deoartment, New Delhi. ^ I forward herewith a copy of a translation of an article which appeared in the 'Zamindar' of Lahore on the 22nd February 1935. This article amounts in effect to an accusation that the Baluchistan Administration has been abetting the commission of raids and decoities by its own tribesmen in Persian territory, and is calculated - and apparently intended - to prejudice good relations between the two Governments. It is particularly unloriunate that* such an article should have been published immediately after the completion of the Zahidan conference. I would suggest that, if the Government of India see no objection, the Punjab Government be addressed with a view to their administering a stern warning to the editor of this paper or such other action as may seem appropriate.\ VS. i i Copy of a translation of an article published in the 'Zamindar' of Lahore in its issue dated the 22nd February 1935. uLmmmLM. The special correspondents of ’Albalagh 1 write that since some time past some dacoits belonging to the British territory of Baluchistan, who are raiding the Persian frontiers, have become a source of great danger on account of their highhandednesses. A few days ago an armed party of these dacoits attacked the frontier and took away some sheep and camels of the Persians. Jaen the Persian Government confronted them they ( the daccits) fired shots at them. A skirmish ensued for a ^ long time and at last the dacoits left the animals and fled away into the British territory quite unchallanged. The travellers crossing Zahidan, Bam and Narmasher etc. are also troubled and their possessions are taken away. Nobody enquires as to who supplies them (the dacoits) with their requirements and as to why they run away into British territory when pursued by the Persians.'T SECRET. Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Cons KhorasAn tA the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 52 (1/24), dated the 1st March 1935.,, ^ 4 i . or I have the honour to refer to my despatch No. 28 (1/24), dated the 23rd February 1935, with which I forwarded the report on the Proceedings of the recent Conference at Zahedan, and in ; particuLar to the proposal made by the Persian delegate tha,t the Government of India be asked to agree to the appointment of a special frontier Commissar. ‘ - - v ... ... - -• -—: . 2. The object of the Persians in desiring such an appointment is clearly part of their general policy of reducing the influence of our Consuls in every possible way. ■ In South East Persia the Persian Military authorities alone have any power and; the Civil Governors who have been -appointed act merely as a convenient buffer to render Corisuls powerless to obtain any redress when British Subjects are oppressed by the Military and Police authorities, 'over whom the Civil Governoir has no power. Consuls may not correspond or meet officials other than the Governor, with the sole exception that the Head of the Police accom panies the latter when paying official calls. Any attempt made by Consular officers to approach the Head of the Police in cases in which that Department or the Military Department, have illegally dealt with British subjects, has invariably met with the reply that the Civil Governor alone cart deal with the matter.. In no case of which I am aware, has a Civil Governor ever been in a position to give any satisfaction/although in many cases ho has admitted ver bally that the action taken has been illegal. ■ i ■ . i 3. When Mr. Skrine was Consul in Sistan, he was able to ren der very great assistance to the Persian Military authorities when action was being taken (1928) to subdue the Baluch tribes. For some two vear’s after Mr. Skrine’s departure the Military Commander in Baluchistan kept in close touch with me and not infrequently sought my assistance in frontier matters—such as the recovery from British Baluchistan of stolen camels and the various minor frontier incidents which frequently occur. It must be ad mitted that the General Officer Commanding also co-operated with me. 4. As long as such amicable relations existed, the influence of our Consular officers in protecting British subjects m East Persia remained considerable. The Persian General Officer Commanding required our co-operation, and in return for the same he was always willing to intervene on behalf of British subjects ill-treated b y Police or petty Military authorities. A hint from him to the Hea of the Police was sufficient to ensure immediate redress^ Very tew cases had to be referred to our Legation, the majority being settled locaHy. ‘ ' .‘ v AT11 . 5 When Brigadier Alburz succeeded Brigadier Nakhjawan in Baluchistan, the situation immediately deteriorated He not only reversed his predecessor’s policy m dealing with the tribes, bu entirely dropped friendly relations with our Consula officeis. I did not desire our co-operation, and having nothing to gam trom us, gave nothing in return. 6 For the past few years British Indian subjects have been treated in Persian Baluchistan and at Zahedan in a manner which can be described only as utterly disgraceful. They are subjected to every form of humiliation, illegal arrest, illegal search of premises and brutal treatment by the Police and petty Military authorities. 23^ i i «{n * vv&lt;Since for the reasons stated above, we have no means of approach to, or influence with, the responsible Military authorities, we can do no more than protest to the Civil Governor, who is equa y powerless, even should he desire to assist. Such protests invariably produce an evasive reply, and the matter has then to be reieire Tehran for diplomatic action. This ultimately results m a re © ence by the Persian Central authorities to the local authorities concerned, who give an entirely untrue report of the circumstance and an impasse is reached. 7. If therefore the Persians can secure that all the assistance- they require in frontier matters, can be obtained rom a r0 Commissar, who has no interest in Persia, they ^ ach.eve theu ohiect in side-tracking our Consular representatives, and ca continue their policy of general obstruction to the latter. 8 The Persian statement that they have found the system of frontier Commissars successful on other frontiers is not borne o hv the facts On the Perso-Iraq frontier disputes have led to referencd to the League of Nations. On the Perso-Afghan frontier there has been continual trouble, culminating in the recent Zuraba incidents which have caused the greatest ill-feeling between the two Only a short time ago my Afghan colleague at Zfbu ~mp^ d to me of the bad relations existing between the Persian t rontier Commissar in Sistan and the Afghan Commissar He stated ttot the Persians were continually presenting complaints, wbll e on th , side of the border they failed to co-operate and grossly ill-treated Afuhan subiects against which treatment he was powerless as he coidd deal only with the Civil Governor whose authority extended only to ‘‘blockading’’ Consuls and collecting municipal dues^ 9 As an example of the attitude of the Civil Governors I would quote a case which has just occurred in Meshed.

On the other hand, thefts from British territory by Persian tribes are comparatively rare. When they do occur, the stolen goods are quite frequently recovered without the necessity for any reference to the Persian authorities.

I understand that the official report on the conference is being submitted by Daly and I propose to reserve my comments until I receive p copy of his report. Demi-official letter, from Mr. C. P. Skrine, Political Agent, Kalat and Chagai, to Mr. H. Weightman, Secretary to Hon’ble the Agent to the Govenor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, No. 40-C., dated the 27/28th February 1935. Please refer to the correspondence resting with my telegram from Zahedan, Haled 18th February 1935, in which I reported that I had reached Zahedan on the 15th. I did not have much difficulty in getting the Frontier Assistant, M. Ahmad Ali across the border without a passport as I found on arrival at Mirjawa that the military authorities at Zahedan had instructed the customs officer to waive formalities and render me and my party all facilities. I was obliged, however, to admit at Zahedan that Ahmad Ali had no passport because he was a domiciled Afghan, and this fact was no doubt noted by the Persians who may draw the attention of His Majesty’s Minister to the fact that we employ Afghans on their frontier. At Zahedan I found that Colonel Daly had been waiting for me for a fortnight and Major Pybus (Military Attache at Tehran) since 7th February. Major Pybus had like myself been delayed by bad weather and had reached Zahedan 3 days late. The Conference opened the following evening at 6 p.m. at the head quarters of General Amanullah Mirza Djehanbani, Mufattish-i-Kull (Inspector-Gen eral) of the Persian Forces. This officer is a personal friend of mine, having been Amir-i- Lashkar (Army Commander) in East Persia when I was Consul in Seistan in 1927-29. In 1928 I was instrumental in obtaining the co operation of the Government of India in the successful measures taken by General Aman ullah Mirza Djehanbani and his second-in-com mand S'arhang (Colonel) Muhammad Khan Nakhjawan to pacify the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan, and he has always expressed him self extremely grateful to me for this help. Colonel Daly and I were both disappointed that though the Conference was held under his auspices, and though the opening speech was delivered by him, he was not actually a mem ber of the Conference. He explained privately to Colonel Daly that it was for the very reason that he (General Amanullah Mirza Djehanbani) ,was a friend of mine that he could not now be rj$3(C F&amp;PB a member of a commission in which he might have to oppose my views.* After the General’s opening speech (in French) a paper entitled “R4sum4 du Frocks* Verbal de la Ikre sdance de la Commission Mixte Anglo-Iranienne” was read out and handed to us. The proceedings at this opening meeting, at which General Djehanbani presid ed, were mostly in French, but as Colonel Daly’s French is somewhat rusty subsequent discussions were held either in Persian or in English, which language the senior Persian delegate, Colonel Arfa, spoke very well indeed. The other Persian delegate was Sultan (Cap tain) Mastofi, wffiom I recognised as General Djehanbani’s Staff Captain in 1928; he speaks very little English. The General himself did not appear at any of the other meetings of the Conference, but we saw him two or three times again and I had one interesting private conver sation with him. His attitude was markedly frank and friendly throughout, as was that of Colonel Arf a and all other Persian officers we met, including the incumbent of the newly- created post of Governor-General of Zabul (Sistan) and Baluchistan, M. Mehdi Quli Khan Tajbakht. We objected at the outset to the French document referred to above being called a ‘‘rksumk du proces-verbal”, firstly, because we refused to be parties to any Quasi-judicial pro ceedings in which the British Government might be regarded as in the dock, and secondly because the document had been drafted before the proceedings commenced. We afterwards found that Colonel Arfa had expected us, after discussion and possible alteration of any phrases to which we objected, sign his “Rksumd” jointly with him and his colleague. This we refused to do, and it was subsequently agreed that the paper should be regarded simply as a rksumk of the Persian case handed to us as an aide-memoire. Copies of it will be sent to the Government of India by Colonel Daly along with his report of the Conference. The chief points made by the Persians related (1.) to a number of raids (acts de brigandage) committed on the Hormak-Zahedan-Mirjawa road by persons alleged to be either British sub jects or Persian subjects using British territory as a base chiefly the Saindak-Robat sector; (2) to certain cases of alleged “moral and material support’’ (appui moral et materiel) given to Persian insurgents by British tribesmen or levies. The conclusion arrived at by the British Government as a result of these incidents was that the “autorities Policikres’’ on the British side, especially at the Saindak, Kacha and Robat posts, •were thoroughly in sympathy with the rebels, assisting them to raid the Persian * The impression I received, on the other hand was that General Amanullah Mirza Djehanbani did not expect that Colonel Daly would be included in our delega tion and that he. General Djehanbani dropped out when he found that this was so (rf .... C. G. Meshed’s tele gram No. Z.-1, dated 7th February 1935). In this con nection I may mention that although Colonel Daly, as Consul-General in the whole of East Persia, was obvi ously the senior British representative, the Persians throughout persisted in treating me as the head of the British delegation-roads, and generally stiffening their resistance; and that as we must have been well aware of what was going on (ne pouvaient quetre par- faitement au courant), the British Government has not acted in accordance with the dictates of international law' and good neighbourliness (bon voisinage) towards Persia. I he w'hole of next day (17th February) was spent in discussing the various cases, beginning with those few of them which had already been brought to our notice {vide Minister’s tele gram No. 28, dated 26th January 1935 to boreign). At the request of the Persian dele gates we compiled next morning a r4sum6 of the proceedings in English. This document was then discussed by us in great detail with the Persian delegates, who brought forward a num ber of amendments which were finally, after dis cussion. incorporated in the proceedings. A copy of this document is appended hereto (Appendix I). It will be noted that very little of the Persian case is admitted, and nothing whatever as to the implication active or passive of responsible officials on the British side. On the other hand much stress was laid by us on the assistance given in the past by the Baluchistan authorities {vide Baluchistan’s telegram No. 2, dated 10th January 1935 to horeign) as a proof of the goodwill of the British Government in the past as well as in the pre sent. r Non-committal as it was, my colleagues wer very d^btful as to the advisability of lettin the Persian delegates have a copy of the doer ment attached; they feared lest the Persia Government should make capital out of th cases recorded and our apparent failure com pletely to rebut the Persian delegates’ argi ments relating thereto. But I may as well sa here and now that as a result (1) of what I ha&lt; found out before going to Zahedan (2) of wha he Persians told us, and (3) of cross-examinin, | the Frontier Assistant, the Post Commander a .Kacha (Jemadar Wazir Khan Sinjrani) th« Havddar in charge of the Pobat post (Haji Dac Khuda) a „d one or two others at Zahedan anc ^obat, I came to the definite conclusions— (a) that raiders some of then, probably British tribesmen, had indeed been using the Saindak-Kach a Robat sector as a base for their operations on the Hormak-Mirjawa road during the recent Ismailzai revolt, (b) that Reki and Ismailzai elements on our side, including some of the levies, had been intriguing with Juma Khf^^ Ismailzai and giving him to under stand that he had their support, with the result that the Persian Ismailzais fully believed for a time that we, the British, were supporting them. (c) that the Post Commanders and the Frontier Assistant himself had quite % wrong idea of the British Government's real attitude towards the Persians and their rebel subjects respectively. My colleagues and 1 therefore laid chief stress \ on the advisability of letting byegones De , byegones and of concentrating on the future. |\ We mentioned the points given in the Govern ment of India’s telegram 118/119, dated 14th January 1935, and I also outlined the proposals for the better control of the Robat sector which I was prepared to recommend to the A. G. G. A summary of these points and proposals and of the Persian reactions to them is given in the second^ appendix to this enclosure (appendix II). Copies of this paper and of the proceedings at the second session of the Conference (Appen dix I) were made by me on the last night I was at Zahedan and signed bv us 3 British delegates. Next morning I had to start early for Nok Kundi in order to catch the weekly train in the evening, so that I had to leave the final meeting of the Conference to my colleagues W e had also drafted as a result of a lorn* dis cussion with the Persian delegates a document tor them to sign “acknowledging the good will and intentions of the British Government on this frontier and accepting the assurances of the British delegates that no responsible British official on our side w'as implicated in any of the. incidents put forward in the Persian resume’’. We agreed that if the Persians refused to sign this formula’’, Colonel Daly would not give them anything in writing at all but would send a report on the Conference together with these draft proceedings etc., to His Majesty’s Minister Tehran and the Government of India for such actmn with the Persian Government as they thought fit..APPENDIX I. Resume of Second Session of the -Conference, 17th February 1935. Present: —Colonel Area., Cnptain Mastofi, Lieut.-Col. C. K. Daly, C.I.E., Major C.D. Pybus, Mr. C. P. Skrine. The Conference first discussed five matters which has been indicated at Tehran (see Tehran .telegram .No. 28 dated 2fitli January 1935 to Eoreign) as for .consideration, of which it will be noted that some were included in the cases brought forward by the Iranians, viz -; (1) The allegation that a farrash of the British Vice Consulate at Zahedan named Dad Shah or ‘Daud Shah had written a letter to Sardar Juma Khan promising British support. (2) That Juma Khan’s brother Ahmad Khan ;had written a letter to the effect that he would endeavour to dissuade his brother from oppo sition to the Iranian Government only if a meeting ‘could be held under the auspices of the British Vice Consul. (3) Two border cases in which camels were Btolen. (4) The alleged detention of an Iranian Sar- juqeh (N. C, O.) and a soldier at Kacha levy post at the request of Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai. . (5) An incident which occurred on the fron tier in which one Iranian gendarme was wound- ,ed and a British levy killed. 2. As regards (1), the British delegates repre sented that no such person as Dad Shah or Daud Shah was, or had ever been, employed at any of our Consulated in East Persia, and as the actual letter could not be produced, the matter was dropped. Point (2). The British delegates pointed out that their Government could accept no respon sibility for anything that one Iranian subject might write to another. The Iranian delegates explained that they had brought up these first two points in order to ghow r that a belief was widespread among the Baluch that they could -rely on British sympathy. .. Points (3) and (4), see below. Point (5). The statements of the Iranian gendarme and of the British levy were discuss ed and the British delegates were of opinion that the statements were conflicting, but -that owing to certain aspects of the case no blame could be attached to either side, and that the matter should be considered closed and regard ed as a regrettable incident probably due to a misunderstanding on the part of both patrols. The Iranian delegates maintained that the fact that the gendarme and the soldier had been questioned separately immediately after the occurrence, and that the incident occured well within Iranian territory, proves the truth of the Iranian version. 3. The British delegation outlined and gave specific instances of the action taken in British territory with a view to discourage, and acti vely prevent, refugees from Iranian territory taking any part in hostile acts against th« Iranian Government. .. . 4. The Iranian delegates then gave detaila of a number of other cases of robberies on ti^e Hormuk-Mirjawa road of which three were cases of theft of animals which were carried across the British border and four were cases qf attacks on motor vehicles in which cases the tracks of the raiders wore followed to the Bri tish border. In one case of theft of camels two robbers were identified as Khan Muham mad son of Mangal Mirbolozai and Gfaulam Muhammad nephew of the QaEi of Zahedan, both resident in British territory. It was understood to be the Iranian view that our levy posts were negligent in prevent ing raiders using British territory as a base or refuge. The British delegates pointed out that the mere .fact that the tracks were follow ed to British territory does not prove that the robbers were resident In British territory. The Chief Persian delegate then stated that in one of the cases he had personally satisfied himself that the tracks of the robbers had come from British territory. The British representatives drew attention to the difficulty of a few scat tered posts in an extremely mountainous and almost uninhabited region effectively guarding their frontier from violation by armed bands engaged in a form of guerilla warfare, and to the unfortunate lack of liaison between the res ponsible Iranian military officials and the British Consular officers, which resulted in news of these incidents either not being brought to the notice of the latter at all, or after so great a delay as to render effective measures impossible. 5. In addition to the above, the Iranian dele gation brought forward the following cases of alleged moral or material support given to Iranian insurgents by British tribesmen or levies, viz. (1) That Ahmad brother of Juma Khan Ismailzai came to Kacha Post with the avowed, intention of crossing into Iran to help his brother, that no body stopped him, and that he did cross the border with three rifles. The British Baluchistan delegate gave his version of the movements of Ahmad Khan. Hp admitted that Ahmad Khan had for some time been at Kacha under surveillance, follow ing a period of some two years during which he had been on security near Dalbandin, over 200 miles from the border. As he failed to produce adequate security for good behaviour while at Kacha, he was turned out of British territory and the Iranian post commander at Mirjawa was informed. The subsequent move ments of this person are not known; should he be discovered to have returned to British ter ritory he will be removed to a safe distance from the frontier. Note.— On the night of 18th February 1935 news was received that Ahmad Khan had been arrested by the levies at Kach Post on re-en tering British territory a few days before. Orders were immediately issued that Ahmad Khan should be removed to Nushki,(2) The Iranian delegate stated that Bahroz Khan Kurd was sent to Ahmad Khan at Kacha to dissuade him from joining the rebels and that he was arrested by tne levies and kept 12 days under surveillance. The Baluchistan dele gate gave the following explanation of this in cident : Bahroz Khan and two others were sent by Sardar Habibullah Khan Reki w r ith a tetter for Ahmad Khan at Kacha asking him to return to Iranian territory. The Frontier Assist ant w'ho was in the neighbourhood heard of the mission, and having had no previous inti mation regarding it, suspected Ahmad Khan of intriguing with the rebels. He therefore ordered the Post Commander to arrest Bahroz Khan and his associates, and going himself to Kacha interrogated Bahroz Khan and took possession of the letter. Bahroz Khan denied that he was on any official mission and said that his business was purely private. The men were retained at the post and the matter refer red to higher authority for orders. Bahroz Khan was released within a few days, although this seciet mission (which now turns out to have been officially inspired) had entered our territory without credentials and without prior informa tion having been given. This the British dele gation pointed out to be contrary to interna tional practice. The Uranian delegates main tained the view that as the letter w^as written by one Iranian subject to another, the sending of it was quite in order and the arrest of Bahroz Ahan and his associates was open to question. (3) It was stated that Jum a Khan captured an Iranian Sarjuqeh (N. C. 0.) and a soldier and sent them in charge of an armed party to Kacha levy post with a request that they should be retained for some time and not allowed to give information to their superiors. The Jema dar in charge of the post is alleged to have returned Juma Khans men with a letter pro mising arms and ammunition. After 9 days the soldiers were released, the N. C. 0. return- n^Zahedan and the soldier deserting to Afghanistan on the advice of the Jemadar. ine Baluchistan delegate stated that nothin whatever was known of any such incident, bu that he would make further inquiries. (4) That Jemadar Wazir Khan of Kacha pos wrote to a friend in Zahedan asking him t, endeavour to obtain the release of one Zamai Khan, said to be one of his men wffio had beei “ » “Ir 10 ? 40 Jum “ Kh “ and had bee, arrested by the Iranians. A;!, Wonnation of the British Baluchista delegate is that Zaman Khan is an Afghan sm with Th t ^“ t I? 8 18 not conn&lt; *ted in anv wa With the Kacha post. Further enquiries ar however, being made. Note.—J emadar Wazir Khan has since bee examined and has categorically denied thf D aee r °Th ^ H J'™ iTOident s «er too tel d h l etter t has been shown to th British delegates^who promise to compare th signature with that of Wazir Khan on othr documents undoubtedly signed by him in th (5) The same Baluch informant who was res ponsible for tbe story regarding the letter sup ported to have been written by Dad Shah (see paragraph I) had reported to the Iranian authorities regarding a n incident alleged to have occurred when he was at Jurna Kban’s head quarters. He said that five Baluchis had/** appeared before Juma Khan and told him that Haji Dadkhuda, Havildar of the British post at Robat, had intended to join Juma Khan with 9 armed men including 5 Chagai Levies. On the way he had fallen in with one Mulla Rahim and supported the latter in a skirmish with the Iranian troops at Shuru. able to accept the hearsay evidence of a single Baluchi (named Slier Muhammad) who had reported the case previously mentioned of the Consulate harrash’s letter and whose evidence was thus obviously quite unreliable. Moreover the scene of the skirmish w^as some 40 miles from the Robat post and at least 30 miles inside ranian territory, and it is incredible that a number of armed levies should have travelled such a distance from their post, joined in a fight and returned to their post wdthout the fact being widely known on both sides of the border. Nor could the levies possibly be absent from their post for more than one or two days without the fact being known to the lev/ officer in c large of the sector and to our Frontier Assist ant who is in frequent telephonic commuwca- . 'T 41 ; 4he Port. The Iranian delegates stated that the 5 witnesses had been identified. (6) It is alleged that early in February twc* Mekrani Baluchis (Irani subjects) named Sar- faraz Khan and Isa Khan of Champ ran arms rom Gwadur m Muscat territory across a strip of Kalat State into Persian Baluchistan for the purpose of arming rebel tribesmen. This incident is of very recent occurrence and nothing ,s known to the Baluchistan delegate,, in the matter, but he has taken noty and' will institute inquiries. If the men named are found to have been engaged in anv nefarious activities he will arrange for their ''removal or arrest. 6. The British delegation having discussed at some length the above cases brought forward iu renian re P r esentative, cannot but feel at friction could have been avoided and many ot these cases satisfactorily dealt with in the ordinary course of routine* had some form of bamon existed .'between the Iranian militfcary and the British consular authorities. Their instructions being that the main object of this conference is to co-operate with the Iranian Government and to devise means to prevent so iar as possible the occurrence of such incidents, the British delegates desired to ascertain from the Iranian representatives what form this co operation should take. Before proceeding to offer suggestions or discuss those put forward by the British delegates, the Persian representa tive stated that he would like to refer the ques tion to higher authority, and the Conference' adjourned till the next day. ..APPENDIX II. Proposals. 1. Refugees. —[See Government of India’s _ telegram No. 118/119, dated 14th January 1935, para. 2, (i), (iv), (vi)]. The Persian delegates were informed that the Government of India Avould not grant extradition in any case, but would insist on securities being furnished by refugee tribal leaders for their good behaviour and for refraining from making use of Indian territory as a base of operations against their own country; also that such leaders would be deported to the interior of India if it was proved to the Government of India by the Persian Government that the presence of such persons near the border was a cause of recurring disturb ance. The Persian delegates demanded that we should deport all such refugees, not only indivi dual leaders, on the grounds that this is the international practice. They said that the Persian Government deports large numbers of refugees from their Turkish and Russian fron tiers and settles them in other parts of Persia. I explained the impossibility of this in the case of Baluchistan and pointed out that in doing as stated the Persian Government were acting in their own interests and not in those of Foreign Governments concerned. 2. Arms and ammunition. —[See ibid, (ii) (hi) and (iv)]. The policy of the Government of India as regardsi arms was explained and debated. The Persian delegates emphatically urged that what the Government of India are ready to do was not nearly enough. They pointed out that the carrying of arms by population of south-east /Persia is absolutely forbidden by law and that the Government of India would be acting in an unfriendly manner if they deliberately allowed refugees returning to Persia to carry any arms at all into the country. We ought not only to disarm the tribes but, confiscate their •weapons and ammunition, compensating them if pve like. I asked whether the Persian Government (expected the Government of India to go to considerable expense to disarm their rebel tribes men for them. Colonel Arfa said that once it became knowm that Persian tribesmen lost their arms for good when crossing the border they would cease to take arms across it and thus would render the task of disarmament easier for the local Persian authorities. (b) I promised to remove, 2 or 3 at a time and not all at once, the majority of the levies at the posts on this sector who belong to the •same tribes as the rebels on the Persian side. I also promised to adopt a system of rotation as regards the personnel employed at the various posts, so that individual Post Commanders and their men from other parts of Chagai district should not be there long enough to make local connections. The Persians welcomed this but said that they would rather that none of the Post Commanders belonged to the rebel tribes. (c) The Persians asked particularly that our levies should always be in uniform when on any sort of duty. The Shamidar shooting case, they said, would probably not have occurred if our men had not been in mufti. The man who w r as shot had got his levy badges in his pocket at the time, instead of wearing them as he should .have. (d) It was agreed that in order to minimis© the possibility of clashes between our patrols and those of the Persians, the strip of country between the two lines of posts should be left as a kind of no-man’s-land, and that both sides should instruct their levies not to patrol more than a short distance in front of their own posts. This proposal obviated the4 necessity of a delimi tation of the frontier in this sector, which the Persian delegates showed no signs of asking them. 4. General. —Colonel Daly made a great point of the necessity for better liaison between Persian responsible authorities (military or civil las the case might be) and British Consular authorities, so as to ensure that complaints were dealt with promptly. The Persian delegates agreed about the liaison, but told us that it was the definite policy of the Persian Government exclude foreign Consular officers from any dealings with border tribes. They wish to replace the existing system in east Persia by a system of “Frontier Commissars” similar to that in force on the other frontiers of Persia. On the Baluchistan frontier they propose to have a “Frontier Commissar” stationed at Zahedan, and request the Government of India to appoint a similar official as near as possible to the frontier on our side. These two officials should meet whenever necessary and deal with all frontier tribal matters as opposed to purely consular affairs.' , t K 3. Measures on the Juzzak-Robat sector .—(a) The Persians asked and we agreed provisionally that some sort of proclamation should be made on our side of the frontier to the effect that the British Government would take serious notice of any act on the part of our population hostile to the Persian) Government, such as co-operation with rebel tribes etc. I explained that it was no use dropping leaflets or anything ot that kind and that such a proclamation could only be communicated verbally by the levies at the While not of course committing myself in any (way, I pointed out that whatever might be the practice on the other frontiers of Persia the Government of India did not so far as I know have such a system of “Frontier Commissars” on any of their frontiers and would be unlikely to view with favour so drastic and innovation on this one. At the same time I was sure th‘,at the proposal would be considered on its merits (and that anything that was practicable would be done to meet the wishes of the Persian Govern-Copy of an extract from a demi-official from Mb. C. P. Skrine, I.C.S., Political Agent, Kalat and Chagai, to Mr. H. Weigbtman, I.C.S., Secretary to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor ^ General and Chief Commissioner in ™ Baluchistan, No. 42-C., dated the 2nd March i93o. I also enclose cuttings from the “States man of 7th February and Civil and Military Gazette of the 28th February 1935. I have no knowledge of how the information contained therein came into the hands of the Associated 1 ress, and I would like the A. G. G. to assure the Government of India that I am not in any way responsible for the appearance of these reports in the Press. I refused to give the local Associated Press representative an inter view or any information whatever both before and after my visit to Zahedan. The wording of both reports is, to say the least of it, un fortunate and likely to cause offence to the Persian Government, especially the passages underlined by me. On my own part, also, I would like to protest against the statement in the New Delhi report of 27th February that my visit to Zahedan has been “in vain’’. It is also quite incorrect to say in the words of the report that we “expressed on behalf of the Government of India that they were ready to have a delimitation of the area but the Persian local officials were not agreeable to this course, and Mr. Skrine therefore returned to Quetta’’. As the de facto position on this Frontier is favourable to us, the Persians hardly occupy ing any of the country to the North-East of the Hurmak-Mirjawa road at all, Daly and I agreed that it would be much better not to raise the delimitation question as we had nothing to gain and a certain amount to lose by doing so. My return to Sibi on the 21st was entirely due to the fact that there was only one train a week and I could not possibly stay another w r eek at Zahedan. As regards the words “in vain’’, “unfortun ately’’ etc., it must be remembered that even if we did not succeed in getting a written with drawal from the Persian delegates on the. charges against the British Government, we did accomplish a good deal. We had a full and’ frank discussion with them of the various complaints made by the Persian Government regarding our dispositions on the Perso-Baluch border, and we had been able to send fairly full reports to Tehran and Delhi regarding the actual facts of the various cases. We also explained to and discussed with the Persian delegates the measures which the Government of India proposed to take, as well as certain other measures which I am recommending on my own account. Finally we got a fairly good idea of the Persian point of view and what they want us to do, e.g., regarding “Frontier Com missars’’. I think it is most unfair to my colleagues and myself, as well as to the Persian delegates, to say that our efforts at Zahedan were “entirely infructuous’’. Copy of an extract from ,c Statesman” of 7th February, 1935. TRIBAL UNREST ON PERSIAN BORDER. India aid sought to restore order. A Conference is pending at Zahedan, formerly called Duzdap, between Mr. C. P. Skrine, I.C.S., Political Agent of Kalat, representing the Government of India, and the Persian authorities therewith regard to Baluchi rebels who have been fermenting trouble round about Kwosh, in Persia, states a message from Quetta.. It appears that in the desolate region near Kwosh, Persian Baluchis have been showing a rebellious attitude towards the Persian Govern ment. There is generally a close relationship between Persian Baluchis and Indian Baluchis in the territory. The Persian authorities re quested the Government of India to assist them to restore law and order. A Conference had been fixed for February 5th and Mr. Skrine had arranged to leave for Zahedan, but owing to heavy floods en route he returned to Quetta. The date when the Conference will now be held has not yet been settled. Zahedan is reached after a long journey from Quetta as far as Nok Kondi by rail and thence for 150 miles by motor.—A.P.I. Copy of an extract from Civil and Military Gazette of 28th February, 1935. The Persian Baluch Revolt. , j Negotiations Fail. Political Agent return to Quetta. New Delhi, February, 27th.- Evidently the attitude of the Persian officials who met Mr. C. P. Skrine, Political Agent, Kalat, at Zahedan to discuss measures to pre vent the Persian Baluch rebels from making their base of operations in British Baluchistan has been unreasonable, as the Conference has abruptly come to an end and Mr. Skrine, who represented the Government of India, has re turned to Quetta. It is difficult to say what developments are now likely to take place, as so far as the Gov ernment of India is concerned, the position' remains unchanged. The measures adopted for preventing reper cussions for the rebellion in the Persian- Baluchistan reaching the adjoining territory in British-Baluchistan will remain inforce but the fact that the boundary between Persia and India is that area which is still unsettled, makes the task of the administration difficult. It appears that the local Persian officials have been more concerned with showing that the rebellion of the Baluchis under their charge has not been caused by any action on their part, than with the success of the Zahedan Confer ence. They have persistently accused the authorities in British-Baluchistan of encourag ing the Persian rebels and it may be that the negotiations in Zahedan were also directed by them more towards apportioning the responsi bility for the revolt in Persian Baluchistan than towards discussing the measures for its suppres sion. The fact remains that the arduous journey Mr. Skrine undertook from Quetta to Zahedan during recent floods in Baluchistan has been in vain.The negotiations. 'An Associated Press message states that the latest news from Quetta regarding the Confer ence at Zahedan shows that the first principles of agreement could not be arranged with the local Persian officials and the Conference, therefore, ended entirely infructuously. The Persian officials, moat unjustly, took the view that the Baluchi rebels in the undemarcated area were using Baluchistan, or the neighbour hood of that frontier, as a. base of their opera tions. They further alleged, without any reason whatsoever, that these rebels were receiving encouragement from the Indian side. As the Persian local officials showed no indica tion of being responsible at all, the Conference soon came to an end.. It was expressed on behalf of the Govern ment of India that they were ready to have a delimitation of the area but the Persian local officials were not agreeable to this course, and Mr. Skrine therefore returned to Quetta last week as already reported. *1 U1PD—733(C) y&amp;PD-S 2—19*3*35—20,Telegram XI.

The conference at Zahidan between pj British and Persian delegations to discuss outstanding incidents and the question of future co-operation in Frontier matters had to be postponed owing to the fact that Mr. Skrine, the Political Agent in Kalat, was held up by floods and unable to get through to Zahidan^but it finally took place about the 18th February. From the two telegrams of 26th February from H.M.’s Minister, Teheran, now attached, itwill 'be seen that the conference has 'broken down owing to further Persian accusations of British complicity in recent frontier incidents, which , they refuse to retract in spite of ^ furnished on the British side. It appears that the Persian delegate produced a further list of definite accusations of moral and material help alleged to have Been afforded By British subjects and officials to Persian rebels. A list of the Persian complaints, which the Military Attache had previously succeeded in extracting from the Persian Military authorities at Teheran, is at flag 'A'. The Consul-General in Khorassan considered that the incidents in question could easily Be explained and could have Been settled locally at the time of their ^occurrence if the Persian G.O.C. had consulted him, as was the procedure a few years ago.

Your telegrams Ncs.Z 1,2,4. pybua has written instructions as to matters to be discussed. Points mentioned in my telegram No.28 to India deserve attention in so far as they touch instances of what Persian Government are driving at but do not constitute main object of meeting which is to examine possibility of measures to help Persian Government in future and thereby to try to kill once for all unfounded suspicion of Persian Government that tribes can count upon British support against Persia. In order to attain this end I think it would be a good tning to listen v/itn sympathy to any tales of woe which authorities at Zahidan may produce. This should help to convince them of our good faith and once tnis object has been attained a more favourable atmosphere should be created for discussion of central question of our future relations on frontier. I entirely agree that it v/ould be well to emphasise that points could be dealt with far more easily if military authorities were always to preserve close touch with your self. I cannot help feeling that presence of Skrine is sti. desirable since he alone can speak with authority as to what further measures, if any, can be taken by authorities in British Baluchistan to assist Persia, But if he cannot get through within reasonable time you will obviously have to go ahead without him.

A 'British Legation, Tehran. ._4_28 JAN !93 7th January, 1935. Sir, As I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 2, the i^rime Minister asked me to call on him at his house on January 2nd, in order to have a purely general conversation on the present state of our mutual relations. 2. In reply to His Highnes8 r question as to my impressions on this subject after six weeks in Tehran I said that, while the major issues were dormant, I noticed a considerable number of tiresome cases which led to recriminatory correspondence and thus poisoned the atmoephSirSs Underneath this our relations in my opinion were perfectly good and there was every reason in favour of friendliness and cooperation. Nevertheless, we seemed to have drifted from this fundamentally healthy state and, owing to a series of minor but aggravating issues, were a prey to a disease which did not represent our true condition. 3. His Highness entirely agreed with my diagnosis. There was every reason why Great Britain and Persia should be on good terms and it should be perfectly easy to achieve this. Persia had no designs outside her own teritory : she was not a powerful country and it would be absurd for her to cherish acquisitive ambitions ; her own territory was large enough for her requirements, it would carry three times its present population s all Persia desired was to consolidate and /develop The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office. ■■Smi —— .~—- 2 - fisv develop herself. 4 . It was useless, His Highness continued, to deny that we had points of disagreement; these were principally in the Gulf, hut he was convinced that with good will on both sides an arrangement could easily be reached. He did not wish to raise these points at present, then Mirza seyyid Bagher Khan Kazemi returned from Geneva it was hoped to resume negotiations, either here or in London. All His Highness desired now was to have a friendly and general talk with me. 5 . I mentioned with regret that mutual mistrust seemed to have arisen, and attributed this largely to the terax^eramental difference between liast and West. His Highness agreed that our difficulties were largely psychological. G. He then went on to discuss in greater detail two points in regard to which, so he said, the attitude of His Majesty’s Government had engendered mistrust in the minds of the Persian Government. I have mentioned these in my telegram. The first related to the Baluchi tribes, with whom the Persian Government are evidently at present having serious trouble. Feroughi spoke first in general of the ,f 8 courge rt to which the country was subjected through the existence of nomad tribes. He touched upon British *^ a $ions in the past with certain of these tribes. I interrupted him to say that in the past, when Persia had been without a strong centralized Government, it had been natural and necessary that we should have maintained relations with certain of the tribes, but that tills was entirely a thing of the past and had been so for a very considerable time. ^eroughi answered that, in the past and in the conditions which I had mentioned, this had been perfectly natural and justifiable and that nobody could object to it. Returning, however, to the Baluchis,he suggested that these relatione to some extent continued* At all events, Baluchis on the Persian side of the frontier stated that they eould always find a saf e harbour if not encouragement on the British side. Persian troops could not pursue them over the frontier and it was always open to them to withdraw into British Baluchistan where they were not molested and, he added, not disarmed. Could not a more stringent control be exercised and these tribesmen be disarmed on the British side? Could not some public declaration be made that no support whatever would be accorded to them? He appealed also for a more stringent control of the arms traffic, both in the Gulf and across the Iraq and Indian frontiers. He could assure me that if some response eould be made to his appeal, and in particular to his suggestion that it should be made quite clear to the Baluchi tribesmen that they would receive no countenance from the British side in their disaffection towards the Persian Government, an immediate and considerable improvement would be brought about in our relations* 7. I was aware that His Highness was merely voicing an old suspicion which it seems impossible to eradicate I emphasised that his suspicions were groundless but, feeling with regard to his insinuations that in existing circumstances it might not be difficult and would certainly be desirable to make some declaration in words of a situation which already exists in fact, I said I would look further into the matter* 8. On the morning following ay conversation my attention was drawn to an article in the ’Itila’at 1 of January 1st (11th Dey) giving what purported to be an account of conditions in that area given by a Persian traveller. This account contained a statement that 'the armed appearance of the brigands would suggest instigation on the part of /somesome foreign elements**. On seeing this article I wrote to the Prime Minister in the terms of the letter of which X enclose a copy, asking that I might be supplied with full facte in order to enable me to enquire further into the matter. 9. If there is any value in Peroughi’s assurance that acquiescence in hie suggestions would produce an immediate improvement in our relations, the matter would appear to be worth following up His suspicions are obviously ridiculous, but the Persian troubles may be increased by the nature and length of the Baluchi frontier and the difficulty of controlling the movements of tribes which live Indiscriminately on both sides. Quito apart from the imaginary suspicions expressed by Peroughi, I feel that something might be done to remove his grievance and to silence his insinuations if it could be brought home to hi® that his practical difficulties are understood and that the authorities on the British side are exercising all possible control over tribesmen who pass across to or from the Persian side. I am without detailed information as to conditions in the area in question and it is probable that all possible precautions are already being taken. But in any case it would be useful if X could be supplied with an answer to His Highness* complainings. I have dealt with the matter in ray telegram No. 4. Peroughi’s second grievance was even vaguer than his first, in fact it was so vague as to appear to me to be absurd. He said that His Majesty's Government failed to accord sufficient support to Persia in international matters, citing the Iraq and Afghan frontier questions. The first of these instances he at once withdrew when I again reminded him /thatthat it was at present purely a issue* The second he was unable to press* 11. I then mentioned some of the cases which I hawe recently had to bring to the notice of the Persian Government, notably that of the Khojas of Ch&amp;rbar and the conduct of Lieutenant Derayasdar in the recent affair of the flag flown by the launch of the s*s* Gannsir (see my telegram No. 208 of the 23rd December, 19*34), and urged Peroughi to assist in removing all tills d&amp;brls from our path* He remarked that these were minor matters, and I have not yet abandoned hope that they may in time be disposed of* 12. I e.m sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. (No* 1.). I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) H*M. Knatchbull-»Hugessen*10 th Janfdary, E' '610 Sir, L2a JAN 1935 ; With reference to ay despatch Ko« 4 of January 7th, I have the honour to transmit to you a copy of the Persian Prime Minister^ reply to my letter on the subject of difficulties with the Baluchi tribes. 2. As reported in subsequent telegraphic correspondence, I am hoping to follow up His highness* suggestion that the matter should be examined more closely at Zahedan by British and Persian representatives and as soon as I have your reply to the proposal contained in ray telegram ito# 10 I will pursue the matter. In the meanwhile I have thanked His Highness verbally for his letter and stated that I am examining his suggestion. 3* As stated in my telegram No. 10 (last paragraph) I now consider that in view of His Highness* disclaimer of all desire to make any accusation and also in consideration of the possibility of examining more closely into the facts underlying his complaint, I think it undesirable to say any more to him at present by way of denial of suggestions of British encouragement to these tribes. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 4). I have the honour to be with the Highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient. humble Servant, (Sgd) H.M.

Please see previous submission on P.Z.^15/35 below ana the telegraphic corresponaence which has since taken place with the Government of India and with Bushire, The most important telegrams are the Government of India's telegram of 15th January, on P.Z.35.4/35, ana the telegram from tne A.G.G. Baluchistan repeated in it. The latter is a valuable appreciation of the situation as seen from the local angle. The Government of India's telegram sets out their views as to the action which they can reasonably be called upon to take in-order to fulfil their international obligations on this frontier. 2. After aiscussion with sir D. Bray it was thought aesirutle to ascertain more precisely' what the Government of India nau in mind when they suggested that it would be consistent with their international obligations to allow tribesmen 'on return...to receive back their arms with exception of those' which had been shown to be the property of the Persian Government. Their answer is given in their telegram of 23rd J anuary on P•Z*515/35. They nave since again emphasised (telegram of 25th January, on P.Z.D66/35) their od jections to extradition ana nave put forward tne suggestion that the conference might deal with two 0 tiler questions arising on this section of tne frontier on which we are the complainants against the Persians. The conference is now to take place at Zahidan on about the 5 th February and it will be jnecessary to take a decision as to approving the government of India's suggestions as to the policy to be adopted. The matter has been the subject of considerable/2 . consideraile unofficial discussion with the Foreign Office. They do not dissent from the general view taken in the Government of Inuia f s telegram of 15th January, save on the point discussed in paragraph 2 ahove. On this they see the strongest objection to * allowing armed rebels to return with tneir arms to Persia for the purpose of resuming operations against the Persians. While appreciating the nature of the Afghan precedents ana the special difficulties of this * frontier they felt that recent Middle Fast precedents, su ch as tnat of the Assyrians (who were disarmed by the iiench on flight into Syria but given back their arms on tneir returning to Iraq, this producing strong ft*, a protests ^.rom the Iraq Government), must also be borne 'V — .^r in mina. But I think tney will probably be prepared to accept a formula based on the Government of India’s telegram of 23rd January on P.z.015/35. I understand that they are also likely to agree to the suggestion in paragraph 5 of the telegram oi 25th January that the two cases in wnich we are complainants should if possible be disposed of at the conference. As is a case of some importance and time is very short it is perhaps better to send an official letter to the Foreign Office in the light of which telegraphic instructions to H.L. Minister could be agreed in demi-official discussion with them, a draft is attached. / ^ / fi - f cdi Draft Paper political Department. 2 9 JAN 1955 Sir, I am directed dy the 5/3 for I. to refer to the telegraphic correspondence noted in the margin, copies of wnich nave already been Telm^ fr.

The 3/3 appreciates the great •1 aifficulty m' distinguishing in circumstances such as those now under consideration between armed rebels and ordinary refugees,and the fact that the country is still tribal country and that individuals on both sides of the frontier would normally carry arms for purposes of self- ! protection is,, as 3ir John Simon will appreciate, an important factor. 1/tfiile, however, he is of opinion that in these circumstances the objections seen by the G.of I. and $ the A.G.G. Baluchistan to the permanent confiscation of all arms surrendered by refugees are decisive, he considers, subject to the views of sir John Simon, To G.of I., No.194, Fr. * No.202, that it would be inconsistent with the international obligations of H.Iw.G. anu the G.of I. to restore to rebels who have taken refuge in British territory^ffie arms with which they j entered into British territor^ /with a : |view to ioair re crossing the frontier ana resuming operations against the ^ersian Govt.j/ lBut given the difficulties ;l of the local situation he is of opinioip. l tnat the simplest course would be to j-tanii action m- questions of | uiiio n^t-urs on ^noy linob su^^os't6(i in ^cu-a: t A the/Department. the G.of I.'s telegram No.202 of 23rd January. 4. The 3/3 airects me to add, with reference to the G.of I.*s telegram of 25th January, No.217, that the objections to any extra- aition as between India and Persia are, as he thinks Sir John Simon will agree, decisive. On the point raised in para.5 of the same telegram he is in entire agreement with the G.of I.'s suggestion that the two other outstanding questions to which reference is made therein should be ! aiscussed ana if possible aisposed of at the forthcoming conference, i 5. subject to the concurrence of the 3/3 for F.A. the 3/3 would propose to telegraphto the G.of I. as in the draft attached.

I added that it was very necessary to have all possible details and prima facie evidence in Tehran beforehand. I called on His Highness again on January 17th and enquired what progress had been made. He informed me Persian Government were in agreement with my suggestion. I stated that in my opinion in order to ensure satisfact ory results from proposed enquiry following points were required (a) all possible details to be furnished in Tehran and an agenda to be drawn up as far as possible.

Particular points stressed were (a) that it should be made clear to Persian Baluchis that they could expect no shelter on Indian side of Frontier (b) that we should take steps for more effective disarmament of Persian tribesmen crossing into British Baluchistan and generally for control of Arms Traffic. Iiinister in reply assured Prime banister that Baluchi tribesmen received no support or encouragement from us, which Prime Iiinister admitted to be correct, 3, Simultaneously with this conversation article probably inspired has appeared in Tehran vernacular newspaper giving account by ^Persian traveller n of situation in Persian Baluchistan and stating that armed appearance of brigands wuld suggest instigation on the part of seme foreign element'. 3.

I have put off tnis afternoon's meeting with hr. Rendel until Tuesday and this will give us time to get a reply. 2. sir D. Bray's general view is; (a) that it would be almost impossible to justify allowing armed rebels in flight from Persian territory to take refuge for a brief period in British territory and then to receive bactc tne arms they had surrendered to Government with a view to their returning to Persia to renew operations; ^ ^ L * (b) that given Afghan precedents there is good justification for offering to give back to tne Persian Government arms which nay be proved to be tneir property; but&lt;2§&gt; (c) that we are aeaiing with an area which appears to he stili trihai, ana if that is the case it is essential for tribesmen to carry arms; that to confiscate all arms in these circumstances^woula he a very serious step. While the knowledge that we would take such a step would he an effective deterrent to individuals who wisneu to take refuge in Britisn territory, we coula not overlook the local reactions of a suaaen change of policy such as this in the difficult conditions of the area in question. l&lt;t. l *r.(COPIES CIRCULATED) ILS-.S..Y F E R 0 P TEL E Q R A M From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India.

Baluchistan telegram seems to us to contain a reasoned and convincing exposition of our case.

XXX Received 12.0p.m., 14th January, 1935. — ^ First of three perta. liis. With a frontier of over 500 miles, of which much is undemaroated, most is uninhabited, anl the whole guarded by a few scattered frontier posts manned from Chagai and Mekran Levy Corps, I cannot guarantee that small parties of armed Persian insurgents have never used British territory as a refuge for few days. On the other hand, I can say definitely that neither large nor small armed bands obtain harbour in British territory ln ! '’ reparation for attacks with our countenancing in Persian territory. It is impossible to deny shelter to the actual refugees, but these are disarmed on arrival in our territory and are required to give security not to use British territory as a base for operations against Persians. - T t is equally impossible to prevent them returning to their own country if they wish to do so, and when they go they are entitled to receive back all their property, including their arms, unless they have forfeited latter by their behaviour while xn our territory. This, however, is very different from tbe suggestion that armed insurgents can cross and reoross the border using our territory as base for attacks.SECRET US/DIA.

Tehran vernacular newspaper of December has published, account by a 'Persian traveller' of situation in Persian Baluchistan with ihtimati^n that 'armed appearance of the brigands would suggest instigation on the part of some foreign elements'. Synchronizing as this does with Prime Minister’s remarks to me it increases my desire to send him in writing a further emphatic repudiation of his suggestions of British encouragement to tribesmen, I would mention that these suspicions have frequently been denied by my predecessors and might refer to Sir K,Hoare’s note enclosed in his despatch No.365 to the Foreign Office. I should be glad to have authority of His Majesty’s Govern ment and Government of India beforehand together with as much material as they can supply. May I have urgent reply on this point. In the meantime I am writing him reminding him of denials given on previous occasions and asking for full facts in support of his allegations. This appears to be all that we can do to deal with fancies of Persian government. As to facts I feel their troubles must largely be due to nature and length of Baluchistan ...Beluehistaa frontier and iraposGibility of complete control It miKht improve matters if while firmly repudiating their imaginary grievances we could indicate that we appreciate and are doing what we can to mitigate their difficulties. No doubt everything possible is already being done and I should be glad if I could give the Prime Minister some assurance of this in reply to representations reported in paragraph 3 of -my telegram under reference and vrith special reference to his suggestion mentioned therein. In any case I should greatly appreciate information from Government of India and authorities in British Baluchistan as to the exact situation and their views thereon.

I hope you will agree with line adopted. Point blank denials of these insinuations which have hitherto been given audience failed to dispose of them. I feel therefore that the best course is while firmly maintaining repudiation of these unwarranted exaggerations to endeavour to trace them to their source. If we can arrive at ohe facts which prompt these fancies it may be possible to deal with them. They are probably due to inherent difficulties of the local situation coupled with desire of unsuccessful military Commanders to explain away their failures. But if there is any further control which com be exercised on British side of the frontier or any other action on lines suggested by Persian Prime Minister it would have good ex j- ec u. I know from conversation I have since had with Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that Prime Minister spoke to me on instructions from the Shah who according to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs continually receives reports which indicate confidence of Baluchi insurgents that they can count on British support even on that of His Majesty’s Consul. It should be easy to discourage this confidenceand to controvert these reports. The Shhi hiaseli appears unahle to understand therr. and I do not think that Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs believes in -onesn; ne has no intention of raising the matter ou-icia-lly. I have again denied them and pointed out that we could have no motive for such conduct which would conflict with our general policy.

I would mention that these suspicions have frequently been denied cy my predecessors and might refer to Sir E.Hoare’s note 74 enclosed in his despatch No.365 to the Foreign Office.

In the meantime I am writing him reminding him of denials given on previous occasions and asking for full facts in support of his allegations.

I am now to say that, in the light of the Government of India's views and sabject to the concarrence of the Saltan of Muscat, which it is understood the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is taking steps to obtain, and to the reservation suggested in t he last sentence of para.3 of 1.0.letter Uo.P.2.4116/34 of 4th July,1934, Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the proposal to authorise H.M.Minister at Tehran to make polite representations to the Persian Government on behalf of the Sultan against the visit of a Persian official to Gwadur without previously obtaining the necessary visa for that purpose.

Mr. Miftah, Persian Vice Consul at Quetta obtained the prior approval of this Administration to his visit to Mekran, though naturally this did not extend to his activities in Gwadur and I was not even aware of his intention to visit this place. In Mekran he was given such facilities as were possible, and if his report to his own Government corresponded at all with his subsequent conversations with the Political Agent, Kalat, it should have done something to remove the false impressions given by other less reputable agents. 3. In regard to paragraph 8 of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf’s letter No. 1072/22/10, dated the 7th May 1934, I may say that I have had no report of Mr. Miftah raising claim to Persian sovereignty over Jiunri, and it would seem that little object would be served by instituting enquiries now.

Please refer to your memorandum No*.F*450-11/33,dated the 12th April 1934 on the subject of complaints by the Persian Government of intrigue from the British side of the oorder with Persian subjects. It is regretted that my reply has been somewhat delayed but the extraordinary nature of the Persian accusation made it all the more necessary to institute the most careful enquiries, while the somewhat primitive means of communica tion with Makran have delayed the receipt of a report from that area. The most careful enquiries have failed to elucidate any information which might serve to explain the rersian allegations. In regard to Sardar Jiand Khan it may be stated categorically that since his return to Persia, no person in Government employ, or in the employ of Kalat State or of the Kharan Sardar, whether levy or other official, has visited him from this side of the border. There used to be certain Yarmuhammadzai Levies employed at Gwalishtap whose services were dispensed with some time ago in the course of the retrenchment campaign and as these men are now living in Persian territory it is perhaps conceivable that their visits to Jiand Khan have given rise to a misconeejalption on the part of the local Persian officials, though it certainly seems incredible that those officials should imagine tnat these ex-levies living in Persia, are still in British employ ment. It may be added that this Administration does not maintain any secret agents on the Mirjawa border. AsAs for the allegations against Risaldar Hassan Khan of the Makran Levy Corps to which a reference is made in paragraph three of demi-official letter No.I*L/20,dated the 19th March 1934 from the Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau, enquiries have shown that this Indian Officer has been solely engaged in his own duties which do± not take him anywhere in the direction of Kastag. The plain fact of the matter is that these charges can properly be ascribed to the attempts of local Persian officials to cover up their own prodigious inefficiency, misrule and oppression which has caused thousands of unfortunate folk to migrate from Persian Baluchistan into Makran and further North. The charges were in fact not unexpected, - it was only a matter of time before they were formulated in accordance with the time-honoured procedure in such cases of putting the blame on intrigue from across the border. Had there been the slightest foundation of truth for these charges it is scarcely likely that this Administration would have afforded the Persian Vice Consul at Quetta every possible facility for visiting Makran and getting in touch with the refugees from Persian territory with a view to induce them to return to their homes. It may be added that the Vice Consul on his return to Quetta informed the Political Agent, Kalat, who had been responsible for the arrangements made on his behalf that he was completely convinced that the charges of intrigue were baseless.To -The lion’fale the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commiseioner in Baluehietan.

Visit of the Persian Vice Consul at Quetta to Gwadur. I have the honour to report that the Persian Vice Consul at 'Juetta, Mr. A.H.Meftah, visited Gwadur by aeroplane without His Highness the Sultans permission and proceedea to make certain enquiries there. This is, of course, primarily the concern of His Highness’s Government. 2. Mr. Meftah arrived at Gv/adur on the xst March 1934 by the Imperial Airways aeroplane. He stayed there till the 2nd March and was put up by Mr. Martin of the Anglo Persian Oil Company. 3. The British Agent at Gwadur visited the Persian Vice Consul on the night of his arrival and elicited from him the fact that the object of his visit was to enquire from the Persian Baluchis the reasons for their quitting Persia. The Persian Vice Consul also told the British Agent that he would visit Panjgur to interview Sardar Ali MohaJnmad. This Sardar is apparently the uncle of Sardar Dost Mohammad who was executed in Tehran some five years ago. 4. On tne 2nd March the Vice Consul visited the Wali of Gwadur and in the course of conversation enquired from him if he knew of the existence of any treaties old or new' between the Persian Government and the Sultan of Muscat and if there were any writings on the subject to let him know their date. The Wali replied that he knew nothing about £ cn .-a- o-i - £ Jfe £2 ''’l these matters but thought that if any treaties existed , o ^ z ImJ \ t.j m 5 n . ^ they would naturally be in writing and that he, the persian Vice Consul, could best find out from his own Government. The Persian Vice Consul left overland for Jiunri on — ‘the 2nd March at about iO a.m. The British Agent, Gwadur reports the Vice Consul’s ac tivities mam ^activities in tb.e Jiunri side of the British Baluchistan. 7. There he met many Persian Baluch refugees whom he tried to persuade apparently in vain, to return to Peisian territory. 8. While at Gwadur and Jiunri the Persian Vice Consul is reported to have stated that Jiunri was formerly Persian territory, and he is said to have asked the local representative of the Khan of Kalat as to the circumstances under which it has now become British. 9. The British Agent received a telegram from the W a zir of Mekr&amp;n apprising him of the Vice Consuls visPt and requesting him to aiford all assistance. This telegram arrived, however, the a. ay after the /ice Consul had left. 10. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty^ Minister, Tehran, the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, Quetta, who has doubtless heard of the Vice Consul’s going from other sources, and the Political Agent, Muscat.P.Z. 3745/54. cj/ D fhyvb* «v&gt; ^ &lt;r-Aw k-A ^ # C CP FI DEPT IAL.

The Brigadier at KlV&amp;gl reported that he had sumtsmea Jlhand iJhan of XA3HKIAE (Masiikhel ?) to his Head quarters to discuss certain matters with him* About this time, the Brigadier heard that two British secret agents, accompanied by two arned man, had visited Jihand -han in Kashkiah, and had made him certain ENCLOSURE IN , | FOREIGN oECREsaRY :&gt; t offersoffers highly prejudicial to Persian inuereats and sovereignty.

Mr. heftah was ordered to give these officers all the help possible locally. 7. the Persian government is anxious to have a couple of gun-boats on the Caspian, as a check on *the impudence of the Bussian Caspian fleet*.

I had oooasion to see His Esoeelleney on February 5th on the subject of the proposed expulsion of Mr. Christopher Sykes as a suspect, and I took advantage of KaseI^li , s inability, in spite of severe pressure, to tell me what precisely had aroused suspicion against him to talk emphatically about suspicion in general, introducing my rem rks with the obser vation that I regarded &amp;&amp;zeiai ? B note as a most improper one* 4. Kazemi protested that he had merely passed on reports received by him from the competent authorities and he would be delighted to learn from me that they were u tru.6* X told him that this hypothetical delight showed that he evidently did not think it altogether impossible that secret mglish 'agents* accompanied by members of a regular force should try and stir up trouble in Persia. It really was rather hopeless. At intervals we were accused of stirring up tribal unrest here or there and other equally frivolous charges were made, and I reminded His Excellency of my remarks at the time of the Evening Standard incident on the subject of handling inter national relations with levity. I repeated that the note was an improper one and added that no Ministry of Foreign Affairs had the right to regard itself as a mere post &lt;£ fiee* 5. The Minister enquired, without any appearance of sarcasm, how in his place I would have dealt with the report which he had passed on to me. I replied that I should have told 'Messieurs les Militairee* that I could do nothing on anything so frivolous and the next time I had seen the British i/Jjaister I should have asked him whether he knew of anything whichwhich mi?jit possibly explain the origin of the rumour* 6* K&amp;zemi had little to say; Ithen attacked my central theme of suspicion and mental instability saying that I43Z Uim in December 3b9agho Shah was not sure that we wished to see a peaceful and prosperous Persia; he was quite sure by the follow ing June; he was more than doubtful by November; completely reassured by December; now suspicion seemed to reign supreme* 7* Kazerai assured me that he dnd all that he possibly could to promote confidence in$ our goodwill* i then reverted to the question 3f Kr* Sykes which will form the subject of a separate despatch. B* Yhether or not Kazerai will pass on to the Shah even the emasculated sense of ray remarks X cannot say, but I have tried to make it a little difficult to avoid doing so altogether by sending him an official r ply (which I enclose) to his note. if he should happen to dare hint to the shah that, judging from the unmodulated indignation which I maintains* for three quarters of an hour, the patience of His Majesty*s Government is gradually wearing out, some good may result, and for a week or two the Shah rasy try and think sanely. There is nobody so far as I am aware who is, even fractionally, the keeper of the King*s conscience and talking to the Prime Ministes or the Minister for Foreign Affaire, who certainly are not, is, as likely as not f a pure waste of time; I can only hope for the best. 9.
