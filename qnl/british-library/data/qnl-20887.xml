In acknowledging the receipt of the specimens from the e r Political Agwnt, Bahrein, forwarded under cover of your lette No. 270, dated the 15th January 1910, I have the honour to inform you that this bituminous rock resembles that obtained from the same place in 1902, and of which an analysis was made both in the Laboratory of the Imperial Institute and in this Department. Dr. G.E.Pilgrim, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, visited this place in 1906, and has given a full report on it in the Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, Volume XXXIY, part 4. There is no doubt as to the high quality of the material, but the original deposit is of very limited extent, so that unless there is evidence of another deposit in Bahrein Island of greater extent, it seems to me useless to make a fresh analysis of the specimens now sent. a■Telegraphic ) ADVANTAGE, Adareas. i LONDON.

Sample (d) from Pit ivo # 3. 5# The Ain-el-Qar is situated in the ^outh of the island at a distance of about twenty miles from Manamah. It is near the bouth end of a desert tract about 18 miles long and ten broad. It is four miles from the nearest sea village Dar-el- i.lanadil which would probably be found tha most convenient place to load the asphalt in boats to take to the steamers. The expense of transport by road to uanamah would be prohi bitive • There are no roads to the Ain-el-Qar but as the ground has no steep slopes and is fairly hard, a oart road to Dar-el- Manadil would not be expansive. Carts and bullocks would have to be imported, as X think that in the long run these would bo much cheax)er than donkeys. There is not a tree^ of any sort anywhere near the place ana the heat in the daytime is intense although the nights are cooler than at Manamah. I doubt whether work would be possible for more tnan nine months in the year. Aboiat 200 coolies could be produced locally at rates of ten or twelve annas per diem. Huts would have to be erected for the coolies as tnere is no village of any sort in the vicinity, uood water is obtainable quite close. 6. Uaptain uac^enzie considers that owln^, to the friable nature of the surface soil, which would not am it of tunnell ing, it would be necessary to work the deposit from the top. The deposit resembles very hard cobbler's wax in consistency and is very difficult to work. At present it takes an Arab 8 hours to excavate one maund of 8 lbs with pick, shovel etc so that special tools or machinery would seem to be essential for serious operations. bo far the Bahrein! has not been able to discover any locallocal uoe or mar ice t for the a tuff and the only .iurcpaan iiritiah Firis at iiaiirain which la Messrs (iray Paul &amp; 0oy f will not touch it. The Shaikh of Bahrain, under iiritiah protection, is the parson who would have to be approached for a conceasion through the British Agent.

No. 192 dated 21st February 1914. 5 recaived from th© Political Agent in this connection. 2. As will be seen, the assurance given by Shaikh f Isa is of a very indeterminate nature. Major Trevor, however, expresses the opinion that it would not be advantageous to press the matter further at present, but that the whole question might be raised again later if the Government of India consider that course advisable.A copy of a letter No. 598-1.B. dated the 16th April 1914, from the Deputy Secretary to tha Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to refer to Captain Eirdwood's letter No. 626 dated the 1st March 1914, on the subject of concessions for working oil in Bahrain. 2» I am to say that the assurance given in the Shaikh*s lettei of the 21st February 1914 to the Political Agent, Bahraih, cannot be regarded as Adequate inasmuch as it only refers to his own interests and does not include an undertaking to consult the Political Agent before entertaining overtures. It is true that under Clause 3 of the Agreement of 1892, the Ruler of Bahrain is debarred from giving concessions to foreigners, but in view of Major Trevor^ early departure, the Government of India consider it advisable in the present connection that he should endeavour to obtain something more satisfactory in writing from Shaikh 'Isa before he goes. It might be explained to the Shaikh verbally that if at any time the British Government saw grounds for advising him to have the oil deposits worked, he might rest assured that his own interests would be fully safeguarded by the payment of royalty or other means, but that it is also necessary for Government to know that their interests are safe, anu that for this reason they would be glad if the Shaikh could see his way to modify or amplify his letter by writing fhat he will not embark on any exploitation himself or entertain overtures in that connection from any quarter without first consulting the Government of India through their representa tive. It might also be pointed out to him that the Shaikh of Kuwait readily gave such an assurance and even went further.%■l&amp;V 14 Major A. .'» Trevor, C. l. e.

Kindly see paragraph No. tnrea of the despatch No. 29 of 3l8t August to Foreign Office from Resident Bushire regard- ing oil seepages in the Persian Gulf c In our opinion it would be most undesirable and inoonve- nient precedent to admit or suggest that this or any other island situated in the centre of the Persian Oulf appertains to Turkey or to make any reference to Bin Saud on the subject The question has never arisen of the ownership of this Islet and adjacent islets of Harkus and Arabi, in this connection please see the Persian Oulf Gazetteero It would be most logical to assign them to Kuwait from the point of view of distance from coast, but that would also be inconvenient and we are moreover precluded by the fact that they do not, under the recent Convention, fall within the boundary assigned to Kuwait. &gt;e would recall the somewhat similar case of island of Halul, vide correspondence ending with Your Lordship's tele gram dated the 4th March 1914, and suggest that we should, if occasion arises as guardians of the waters of the Persian Gulf and the pearlf isheries for the riparian communities, claim to de0.1 with these islands and other such derelict sandbanks ourselveso In the meanwhile we might, if it is considered necessary, erect in communication with the Naval Commander-in-Chief wooden navigation beacons on them.fVix;'- AV (l) F No, Cf.-187 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 30th August 1914. j From— Major S.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a despatch No. 29 of the 31st August which 1 have addressed to His Majesty 's Secretary of State, on the question of supplying information regarding oil seepages in the Persian Gulf, to a certain Mr. P. Stewart said to be in the employ of ' Pearsons.' Enclosure of (1). His Britannic Majesty's Consulate-General, Bushire, 31st August 1914, Sir, I have tlie honour to forward for such instructions as you may see fit to favour me with in regard to the reply to be sent to ♦Dated 30th July 1914. the sender—the copy of a letter* received from Mr. P. Charteris A. Stewart enquiring for information re certain oil seepages mentioned in ' Engler's Petroleum ' as existing in the neighbourhood of Bernaid-el-Or (near Kuwait) and the Islands of Garu, Tarsi and Halul. Mr. Stewart is believed to be in the employ of Lord Cowdray and presumably connected with ' Pearsons.' He has already applied in similar letters to the one now under refer ence to the Political Agent, Bahrain, and to His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah, who have in each case referred him to me. Your letter, Sir, No. 299, dated 7th July 1914, to His Excellency Sir Louis Mallet has reached me in blue print and would seem to imply that His Majesty's Government are not averse to introducing the Turkish Petroleum Company into Nejd and Basrah. As regards the actual places in respect of which Mr. Stewart desires informa tion, Bernaid-el-Or should read Banaid-ul-Qar which, with Qaru, is included in the territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait, Tarsi should probably read Farsi and is probably an appanage of El Ahsa, in which case negotiations should be undertaken with Bin Saud, recently appointed as Turkish WaH of Nejd. Halul is indeterminate, but the island itself is well known and a beacon has lately been erected there by His Majesty's Government in connection with the Lighting and Buoying Scheme in the Persian Gulf. It probably belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dthabi. As regards indications of oil, the names Banaid-ul-Qar, and Qaru certainly suggest pitch or bitumen and the Persian Gulf Gazetteer at page 617, Volume II, speaks of an intermittent spring of bitumen existing under the sea m the neighbour hood of Halul. I have no special information in regard to Farsi and have not been able to find anything in my records. Such informations as we have in this office of these indications is very meagre and generally confined to fisherman's talk of pitch floating in the open sea. I fear therefore that it would be of\|ittle use to Mr. Stewart.- A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India for in- formation.

My impression is that both Shaikhs were asked in 1913 not to enter into negotiations for oil rights without previous assent of uovornaent. I have called for papers from Bushire and will submit report on receipt. As inAs regards Bahrain. I think it in in the interest of Government that the A.P.O.C.. ao an all British Govt, controlled institution, should have exclusive oil rights there. It would however be preferable that rights should be acquired and work if any should be undertaken by e special company under some such title as the 'Bahrain Oil Company'* as were work to be undertaken or rights acquired by the A. p .O.O. it might ^e excuse for revival of Persian claims on Bahrain, xhe position as regards ICoweit, where I understand that recent investigations have given promise of good results, is not quite the same. If the status of the Shaikh of Koweit vis a vis the future British Administration of these Territories iz to be mutatis mutandis analogous to that agreed to before the war and embodied in the draft Ahglo Turkish Convention, then it is open to question whether the Shaikh has power to grant oil rights for his exclusive financial benefit. It may be better for such rights to be granted by H.l .G. after the war, to a selected institution 6n suitable terms, with the consent of the Shaikh, on term^ to he arranged with him by us. Moreover it may be convenient that oil rights in Mesopotamia and Koweit should be in the same hands and not dealt with piece meal. If it is desired by the Admiralty urgent that borings should be made at Koweit at once I think the work should be taken at the expense of and on behalf of this Administration or of the Imperial Govt. This will leave it open to UM f s Govt, to deal with Koweit oil rights simultaneously with those of the Occupied Territories. Addressed S. of S. repeated Foreign Simla. Oox, BBDSTelegram.

No. 201, dated the 17th June 1905. From—The Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In reply to your letter of the 12th instant, the asphalt deposits in Bahrein are undoubtedly owned solely by the Chief of the Islands. Last year in addition to the fortnightly down mail steamer to Bombay, eight British and one Russian steamers called here on their way down the Gulf. Of these, one took pilgrims to Jedda two or three were returning in ballast direct to Calcutta, having come up with rice, and the others were proceeding to Karachi or Bombay. I imagine that an approximately similar number of vessels will call here this year. G. C. Press, Simla.—No. C S09 F. D. — i-io-os.—67 —R, S.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Bahrain (both posts being held by numerous incumbents during the period covered by the file), and Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah, ruler of Bahrain.In January 1901, John Calcott Gaskin, then Political Agent in Bahrain, wrote to the Political Resident Major Charles Kemball, reporting that asphalt deposits had been discovered at Jebbel Dukhan [Jabal ad Dukhkhān] in Bahrain, and were attracting the interest of the German company Wonckhaus &amp; Co. (folios 1-2). In January 1902 Gaskin further reported to the Resident that Wonckhaus &amp; Co. had approached Shaikh ‘Īsá with a view to securing exclusive rights to the extraction of the asphalt (folios 3-4). Between the years 1903 and 1909 British representatives carried out a number of geological surveys on the asphalt deposits, the first, in 1903, being carried out by Gaskin himself. The results of each of these surveys suggested that, though the deposits of asphalt were neither extensive nor commercially viable, they did provide evidence that more significant reserves of oil might be present (folios 17-24, 43-46, 79).Correspondence in the second half of the file shifts to the question of the Shaikh of Bahrain’s ownership of the asphalt/oil deposits, and efforts by British officials to secure exclusive rights to the mineral resources. In early 1914 the Political Agent, Major Arthur Trevor, exchanged a number of letters with Shaikh ‘Īsá, seeking assurances that British officials would be consulted prior to any attempts at extraction, and that the Shaikh would not consult anyone else over the extraction of his mineral resources (folios 83-100). Correspondence at the end of the volume indicates outside interest in Bahrain’s mineral resources. Enclosed with a letter addressed to the Political Resident dated 1 May 1914, the geologist and oil prospector Charteris A. Stewart enclosed a map showing the sites of oil seepages in the Gulf, including at Bahrain, and enquired after the governance of a number of islands in the Gulf (folios 106-07). In June 1914 the Bahrain Political Agent and the Political Resident discussed interest in the Gulf’s oil deposits from Messrs S. Pearson &amp; Son, whom Stewart was representing (folio 108).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geological surveying</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bitumen</topic></subject><subject><topic>Resources exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ec#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
