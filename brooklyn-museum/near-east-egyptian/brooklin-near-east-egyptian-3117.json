The face has a protruding triangular nose; two concentric circles surrounding a central dot form each eye. The unarticulated arms curve like loops from the shoulders; the hands, without indication of fingers, are held to the chest. Similarly, the legs have no joints or other details, simply descending with a slight inward curve from the hips.", "medium": "Clay", "dimensions": "height: 7 1/2 in. (19 cm)\r\nwidth: 2 3/4 in.
