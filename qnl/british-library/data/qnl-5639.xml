OIL A GREEMENT - FUJAIRAH Reference your D.O.No.C/1346• I have talked to Lermitte about this matter and 1 gather the situation is as follows. 1. tfhen Leimitte v/as in Dubai in March 194 1 he was approached by the Shaikh of Fujairah on the subject of an Oil Agreement. n e was informed verbally that during the War the Company was not in a position to carry out any exploration and in these circumstances no useful purpose could be served by concluding an agreement at that juncture, in making this reply Mr. Lermitte v/as guided also / 'by- 2 - by hia knowledge that the Gompfiny should not enter into any nego tiations with a Ruler without the knowledge and approval of the lolitical Department. 2. On the occasion to which you refer Mr. Wakefield gave Mr. Lermitte the impression that he was bringing the Ruler round more on a courtesy call than on a business one, and he (Mr .\7akef i eld) did not take the question of an Oil Agreement seriously. There are several small Trucial Coast '•Rulers'* in rather a similar position, among others; Omm al ^uerain ^1 Hira n.1 Hamriya and if it is the policy to include some or all of them in oil agreements it would be necessary for us to refer again to our principals in London for instructions. We do not propose to do this unless you recommend it as we are confident that our Managing Director does not feel that it is necessary to enter into fresh commitments at this stage. 3. As Mr. .Vakefield did not address us officially on the matter and did not appear to be attaching any importance to it Mr. Lermitte telephoned the result of the August interview to Capt. Dixon, namely, that the Shaikh had been informed that the Company's policy remained as explained to him in March, 1941, vide para 1 above. No. 798__-S. CONFIDENTIAL .

EMERGENCY ADDRESS : KING’S HEAD HOTEL, HORSHAM, SUSSEX. Telephone: Horsham 785 6. 29th April, 1940. Dear Mr. Gibson, Referring to your letter No. PZ.5742/39 of the 20th September, 1940 and to our recent conversation, we do not propose, in the existing circumstances, to resume our exploration surveys in the Trucial Coast area during the winter of 1940/41. The organization and maintenance of the geophysical and geological parties required for the surveys will necessitate the expenditure of foreign exchange for the purchase of equipment, and the employment of American staff, and we do not feel justified in making application to the T r easury for such foreign exchange for operations which cannot be productive during the course of this war. Furthermore, the supply of foodstuffs and fresh water from India or elsewhere during the war to parties on the Trucial Coast would probably be difficult and precarious. Our Bahrain manager reports that M it would seem that long before any surveys are renewed on the Trucial Coast, the whole situation will require re-examination'. I am not clear what he has in mind and have asked for more information, but I gather from other reports that the influence and control of the Shaikhs outside their headquarter Towns is no better than it was during the season 1938/39. Drilling will be continued at Qatar and the number of rigs may be increased if the second well, now about to be drilled, is as successful as the first. The usual annual payments to the Shaikhs will be made under the terms of the Concessions, and I will arrange for Lermitte to pay them visits to explain why our operations have been temporarily postponed.

It appears from this that during the negotiation period he claimed and actually received a rate of pay for the guards etc. supplied equal to double the rate paid in the other Trucial Coast territories. This had perforce to be paid by us and has no reference to work in territories outside his own. The idea that he would charge us the sane or greater I amounts during the exploration (as distinct from negotiation) period is rather in the nature of a fear than a fact or ^\ definite threat. Lermitte and Packer will explain this to Vfeightman and will be able, I hope, to remove all uncertainties. J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.

The decision to abandon hinterland exploration in the coming winter is most disappointing* As, however, His Majesty’s Governmait have concurred in this decision little object will be served by making any comnent beyond remarking that each single statement in Lopgrigg’s letter No. PC. 28/61 dated the 18th July 1939 can be refuted. 3. In regard to the suggestion in paragraph 4 of the Express letter under reference, it seems to me desirable that there should be some clarification.

Lermltte states verbally and the Shaikh denies that any discussion was held'in regard to geophysical exploration inside the area covered by the Concession.

Dear Mr. Peel, In continuation of my letter PC.28/61 of July 18th, I should like to confirm -what I told you by telephone yesterday: that is, that our Trucial Coast geophysical party will be of double strength, giving a total of almost or quite a dozen Europeans and Americans. We attach much importance to this party - which is, by the way, an extremely expensive one. In this connection, I would refer again to the point which you mentioned in your letter No.4476/39 of July 28th, addressed to me. Unless we meet with a reasonable attitude from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and unless he avoids the sort of impudent and avaricious demand which we have some reason to fear, it will very seriously prejudice the party’s prospects. For example, the geophysical party will be fully mechanised, but, although we are providing cars upon a sufficiently generous scale for all its technical work, supplies, etc., it will be impossible to carry an unlimited number of guards and/or the slaves of the Shaikh and his relations. Do you think it would be possible for a definite understanding to be reached with the Shaikh as to the number of guards and their rate of pay (for which Re.l per day is a full rate accepted everywhere on the coast, as against the Rs.4 per day which he demands) through the kind offices of the P.A. Bahrain or the Residency Agent, Sharjah? Perhaps the latter could accompany Mr. Lermitte to Abu Dhabi for the settlement of this matter, which, though petty in itself, could cause a lot of trouble.2 il. Apart from the geophysical party, a geological party, under Mr. Lester Thompson, also with its own transport, will, we hope, be working up the Batinah Coast from Muscat before the end of the year. I propose to inform the Sultan of this in one of the semi-official letters which we exchange from time to time, with a copy to his P.A. Yours sincerely. R.T. Peel Esq., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.3o ■LEPHONE : NATIONAL 3S82 CODES : » TELEGRAMS : ILAND : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE K-zi*. 4476 ' ■NTLIJY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL COAST) LIMITED Etear Mr Peel, I write in accordance with your wish that I should do so, expressed after a conference between Mr. Walton, yourself and myself yesterday afternoon. The subject is, of course, Trucial Coast and Oman exploration in the forthcoming cold weather. Our full desiderata on the subject have already been given you in my letter number P C.28/ 24 dated -April-12thy After writing that, however, we became aware items 3 and 5- were not likely to be practicable: therefore, putting aside items 6 and 7 as being purely aerial enterprises, we are left with items 1, 2 and 4. The geological survey on the sand- covered areas near the coast will, we hope, be carried out, as I explained yesterday: this is item 2 of my letter 23/24. Similarly, there should be no difficulty about further work along the Oman coast northwest of Muscat, and the Sultan has confirmed this. The difficulties arise over access to the regions mentioned in item 1, and here again they are in two y parts. The first - Jebel Faiyah - involves access to the territory of the Bani Chitab, which we are still hopeful of accomplishing through the help of our friend Shaikh Khalid i of Kalbah: owing to the summer disposition of the tribes, we shall have no certainty about this until the autumn. The main area which occupied us at our conference yesterday was that bounded on the north by Baraimi and on the south by Ibri. Access to this area can 'be obtained by one of two ways. We hoped at first, as you know, to gain our access through the good-offices of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, with the acquiescence of the Sultan of Muscat. From this strategy, however, we seem to be prevented by two considerations: firstly, the DIRECTORS CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON • E.C.2 18th July, 1939. Lord Cadman, G.C.M.G. (Chairman). W. Fraser, C.B.E. C. S. Gulbenkian (formerly Armenian) J. B. A. Kessler (Dutch) PC.28/81 L. M. Lefroy. J. A. Meny (French) H. G. Seidel (U.S.A) R. W. Sellers J. Skliros impudent and unreasonable demands made by Shaikh Shakhbut asa condition for helping us at all (and even so we have no guarantee that his help would be effective,or his further demands kept within bounds): and secondly, the confident claims made by the Sultan of Muscat - claims which the Political Agent, Muscat seems inclined to support - that fully nine-tenths of the area in question owes allegiance to the Sultan and can only legitimately be approached under his auspices. It is thus clear that we must explore the Ibri/Dhank/Hafit area with the Sultan f s help and within limitations upon v/hich he insists, or not at all. Provided that we set out from the Batinah coast, keep within his dominions, are accompanied by the Shaikhs whose loyalty he claims, and confine ourselves to camel transport, he states that he can give us the entree to the desired areas. There are, however, I feel, arguments against accepting this offer this year even while realising the Sultan’s good intentions. Firstly, the country and tribes are wild in the extreme, their actual loyalty to him is known to be highly precarious and shallow-rooted, and their anti-foreign and anti-Christian sentiments highly developed. These factors and the fact that our parties last year were, during a brief and unsatisfactory visit to that area, twice attacked by rifle fire make it difficulty to feel that the party would be safe. Their supplies, ex hypothesis reaching them across the Oman mountains,would be slow and unreliable and their line of retreat, if necessary, through difficult country. Secondly,' I do not believe that Shaikh Shakhbut, who has formulated a programme full of benefits to himself in introducing us to these districts, would care to see us gain access from the opposite direction. I cannot believe but that he would feel it a blow to his prestige as well'as his pocket: it is to be remembered that the Shaikhs of the Na’im and A1 bu Shamis flatter him with expressions of devotion probably as often as they flatter the Sultan of Muscat. (Their flirtations -with Ibn Saud are also common knowledge). I cannot feel convinced that our initiation of separate work in Shaikh Shakhbut’s own country will, as Sir Trenchard Fowle suggests, prevent Shakhbut from any intrigue or interference against us in Hafit area. Thirdly, the Sultan is himself definite that the party must not use motor transport,which suggests two considerations: the one, that so severe a handicap must diminish the valueof the party’s work and %*&amp;*&gt;&amp;&amp;&amp; dispose one less to take risks on behalf of it: the other, that the attitude of tribes which will perhaps permit the presence of Christian foreigners mounted on camels, but not if they ride in cars, does not inspire much confidence in their good-will. The general consideration must be added that the picture painted by the Sultan in remote and civilised Muscat, immediately after a visit of the principal Shaikhs concerned,may well prove to be somewhat optimistic as contrasted with conditions which the party actually encountered on the visit to this area last year. It was in 1938 well understood that the party from the north was to join forces with the party from the south and proceed to a full and leisurely examination of the country. This, however, proved, as you know, quite impossible, and the results of the whole campaign were disappointing. Our representative visiting Muscat recently was assured that the Sultan's influence and prestige were growing rapidly. If this is so, and if a motor road from the Batinah coast south- westwards could be engineered without much difficulty, probably an expedition next year would start with much greater chances of success. A contributory element to such success would be a more reasonable attitude by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, whose childishness is at present a serious nuisance. Would it be possible for the Political Agent, Bahrain to advise the Shaikh in the direction of carrying out the Concession in a real spirit of reasonableness and helpfulness - a test case of which would be his attitude over the question of guides and escorts. I must apologise for the length of this letter. Yours sincerely, P.T. Peel, Esq.

Wei^itman informs me that there is already an unfortunate impression in Bahrain, C&amp;tar and the irucial Coast, an impression Y/hich he himself shares, that Petroleum Concessions Limited having got concessions are not out to work them* invidious comparisons are drav/n between what they do or rather do not do, and what the Americans actually carry out. I myself have received information from an excellent source that the nuwait Oil Company's work at Kuwait is being slowed dov/n by their headquarters in London - the local employees of the Company are keen enou^i and at Qatar the Petroleum Development (Qatar) limited have not done very much. in fact I am rather surprised that the Shaikh of Qatar has not made complaints under this head. (I have referred to three different Companies in name bjit the moving spirit in each is of course the same i.e. the Anglo-Iranian oil Company). - 3, I daresay that the comparisons with the Americans are not altogether fair, and from the strictly commercial point of view of marketing their oil, the letroleum Concessions Limited in present conditions in the oil world may be justified / R*T* Peel, Lsquire, M*C.

With the above in mind it looks to me very much as if Petroleum Concessions Limited are seizing any excuse not to take advantage of the Sultan’s proposals and i think they should be kept up to the mark. iiven if they do not achieve much by their exploration they knew perfectly well when they got the concession that exploration in the interior would be difficult. 5* Information in this letter is not of course for passing on to the company but may perhaps interest the India office. * I am sending.copies of this letter to Metcalfe, Wei pitman and nickinbotham. however, in which they have promised to pursue their workGOVERNMENT OF INDIA..'

I said, as he knew, 1 had come specially back from Gwadur to see him but on my arrival yesterday I discovered that Petroleum Concessions 1 representative was proposing to go to Sober in the hope of meeting him there and as X had no idea that he was proposing to leave Muscat X had now come to ask him if he did intend to go to Sohar or not for if he was not going there it was quite useless Petroleum Concessions 1 representative going there to meet him. The Sultan said that he had no intention of going to Sohar. Sometime ago the Naim and the A1 Bu Shamls Sheikhs had said they would like to come to Muscat to see him and he had put them off and said ”1 will see you when X come to Sober 11 . They had again asked through his Wall at Sohar when he was going to Sohar and he had replied 'after X return from Dhofar'. Further letters had elicited the answer 'after X return from Gwadur'. His Highness said that it had certainly not been his intention to go to Sohar at this, the hottest, time of the year. He did not believe in interviewing people till he was ready to use them as if you gave them time to think they always made difficulties which were hard to overcome. h few days ago his Wall at Sohar had written that the A1 Bu Shamis had arrived and was Muscat on the 8th June 1939 His Highness the Sultan said he was having a really I explained that X had asked for this interview / proposingproposing to corns in and see him in Muscat. He had at once written and told the Wall to dleuede the Sheikh from coming to Muscat and to put him off by saying that he would let him know when he was coming to Sohar. (I think his Highness was thinking of his pocket). The Wall replied that the A1 Bu Shands insisted on coming to Muscat and that the two Naim Sheikhs also had appeared. He, the Sultan, immediately sent a car for them. said, had expressed their loyalty to him and their willingness to follow his directions. I said X thought that if Petroleum Concessions Limited naxn wished to discuss their programme then now was the time and Muscat the place. His Highness agreed but remarked that the Sheikhs were returning tomorrow. X said that this was unfortunate. Hie Highness **** that their presence was not essential to any discussion with Petroleum Concessions Limited all that was necessary was for him to give them such directions as might be necessary after talking mat ten; over with Petroleum Concessions Limited's representative. His Highness added that he had arranged, at their request, a year's trues between the A1 Bu Shamis Sheikh and Sagr bin Sultan of the Naim.

It is now possible to suggest answers to the three questions contained in that letter from new evidence which despatches from Lerraitte contain. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, whose initial attitude seemed so satisfactory, has now changed J / and demands as a condition for any co-operation at all: (l) a present of Rs. 10,000 for himself li.siro (2) 20 guards at Rs. 4 per day with free food and camel hire ( 3 ) entertainment upon a princely scale for any visitors and parties what soever which might visit him during a Royal progress which he proposes to make to Baraimi and during his stay there, with cash presents for every visitor. Lermitte reckons the cost of these items (which do not include a penny for the important Shaikhs of the areas really concerned) at Rs. 25,000. In spite of all arguments he refuses to abate these demands which, you will agree, are quite unacceptable. \2 rs So much for the Abu Dhabi line of approach. The other possibility is the Muscat line. Lermitte is now at Muscat and has thrashed it all out with the Sultan. The latter, of course, claims the territory of the Na f im, A1 bu Shamis, Bani Cha f ab, etc. to be part of his dominions: the Shaikhs are his most loyal and devoted subjects and are in receipt of regular salaries from him: he has recently established peace between them. He is prepared to have a party conducted into their country, but absolutely declines to permit the use of cars. I understand from Lermitte 1 s cable that the Political Agent is inclined to support the Sultan*s claims and to deprecate the use of motor transport in areas where His Highness disapproves of it. Inability to use cars would be a most serious objection to our use of the Muscat line of approach; and apart from that, I cannot feel any confidence that a party thus introduced would fare any better than it did last year, in which they got nothing more than one ride straight through the country concerned on camel-back. Moreover, it is hard to believe that the goodwill now offered by Shaikh Shakhbut, on whatsoever terms, would not be turned into active opposition in the critical areas concerned, if we decide to leave him out of the picture and sail under the Sultan*s colours instead. It must be remembered that in the Baraimi/Hafit area Shakhbut means a great deal more than the Sultan, who has never been seen there and is not directly represented. No doubt the Political Resident is fully informed of these circumstances, which cannot but appear to constitute a strong case against trying to enter that area at all until better times. Have you received any recommendations from him, whether positive or negative? Yours sincerely, J.P.

If, as I suppose, you have had a trying journey to Schar to no purpose, it is regrettable and evidently means that the Sultan changed his plans, or that you were misinformed about them.

I enclose a copy of the telegram received by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. from Mr.Lermitte in which, in view of the presence at Sohar of the Sultan of Muscat and certain haim and A1 bu Shamis Sheikhs, he suggested an immediate visit to Sohar in order to discuss plans with the Sultan. The Company regard this development as offering an opportunity of arranging matters with Sultan which should not be missed and as immediate orders to Lermitte were essential they have with my concurrence (as stated in my telegram) authorised him to visit Sohar. 2. Had time permitted I should have preferred to have consulted you before consenting to Company's suggestion, which is a modification of programme recommended in your letter of 4th May in that access to Hafit and Dhank may now be arranged through Sultan. As however approach to Sultan is being made by same negotiates* after sounding Abu Dhabi and receiving promise of co-operation, I do not imagine that you will see any objections. This procedure should also avoid difficulties indicated in my telegram Ho.945 vis-a-vis the Sultan and may render it unnecessary for Political Agent to approach him if he has not already done so.

Jj 3 iO 7 ^.3 (Xt .vt/rj I send you a copy of a letter we despatched to Mr. Lermitte immediately after my conference with you two days ago. A copy was, of course, sent to Bahrain and will, no doubt, be shown to Weightman. I am sending you also a copy of a D.O. letter from Lermitte, dated from Dubai on the 16th. It contains various items of news. That contained in the first two paragraphs encourages one to think that the Shaikh of Kalbah has recommenced active negotiations with Mohammed bin Ali bin Huwaider: but the penultimate paragraph suggests that our fears of a protest from the Sultan of Muscat are likely to be realised. I do not so much fear that his influence will sway the attitude of the Shaikhs of the A1 bu Shamis and Na’im, if we treat the latter more generously than he is likely to: I am afraid of a deter ioration in the Sultan’s attitude to the Company on other fronts - though it would not be surprising if his annoyance was directed more against Political than against the Company.' R. T. Peel, Esq. M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1. Yours sincerely, —yvM enclosure in air wail letter N o. FUOM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE Ends.j i PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL COAST) LIMITED. PC.28/43 My dear Lermitte, Your letters dated April 30th and the Minutes enclosed with them have been very carefully considered - also the telegrams dated May 8th, May 9th, May 19th and May 23rd which followed them. A reply has been delayed pending consultation with the India Office who have been awaiting the recommendations of the P.R. These recommendations only reached Whitehall yesterday and were the subject of a conference this morning, from which I have just come. The India Office authorities feel very much the same hesitation as myself over treating the areas of Hafit and southward of it as being outside the interest of the Sultan of Muscat, when last year our party visited these areas with his official representative and after they had been 'sweetened' out of his treasury. The further south one goes from Baraimi the more one penetrates into country which we know that the Sultan claims and for this reason it is desirable not to make any approach to the authorities of Dhank unless and until spokesmen of the Na’im there approach you. For the rest, we can argue (a) that last year’s parties were not given a fair chance to see the country, but were merely once hurried through it and forbidden re-entrance. (b) it is administi^bively much easier for us to deal with that country from the north, and we have the necessary contacts for doing so. (c) we are bound to use motor transport, and this cannot possibly be brought up from the south, while the experiment of bringing the party from the south and the motors from the north, was proved last year to give poor results.PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL COAST) LIMITED. - 2 - (d) the fact that we enter certain districts from the north does not prejudge the question of the real sovereignty thereof: if we enter, for instance, the Hafit area by direct arrangement with the local Shaikh, it need not mean that the Sultan of Muscat will not be allowed to make good any claims of overlordship which he can establish. (e) we are acting in direct compliance with Political advice, which we evidently cannot ignore. Whatever indignation the Sultan of Muscat may show - and I regard it as unavoidable that he will protest at a sooner or later stage - the India Office have promised to support us and try to prevent any ill effects. The P.R. apparently wishes the parties to commence operations on October 1st. This, from the climatic point of view, seems very early and October 15th or 31st would appear preferable. Two parties are visualised at present. One, a geophysical party operating in the Dubai, Abu Dhabi coast and hinterland, and two, a detailed mapping party covering Faiyah - Hafit, and Dhank if possible. If it is decided to do further work on the coast northwest of Muscat, that will involve an altogether independent approach to the Sultan, although perhaps the same geologists might be used. The geophysical party would consist probably of five Europeans (possibly Frenchmen), the mapping party probably of two Americans. The first party should present no particular problems as we are assuming all Abu Dhabi to be open and well- disposed. The itinerary of the second party depends upon the degree of security and the areas thrown open. Both parties will be motorised. The decision to post a European manager in Muscat will not be taken until it is more certain that work will be undertaken in territory under the Sultan’s effective control, e.g. in the Batina. This would probably be towards the end of the season. As regards negotiations with Mohammed bin Ali bin Huwaider, you can do little but sit back and hope that Khalid will be more successful than last winter - and if he is, hope to follow up by bringing in the Bani Ka’ab. As regards Shakhbut’s proposed part, it will be very interesting to see how far he is willing to play and whether the Na’im (presumably excluding Saqr, for whom we have no further use) and Al bu Shamis will re-act more favourably than they did in December last. You will be able to promise presents of the order of Rs. 3,000 (or equivalent in M.T. dollars) to people of the calibre of Rashid bin Hamad, Mohammed bin Rahmah, Ahmad al Saif, and Mohammed bin Sultan,PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL COAST) LIMITED. 3 and in the northern area, the heads of the Bani Chitab and Bani Ka f ab, with presumably much smaller amounts for the smaller people. Where you make arrangements to obtain what we want by presents in cash, half of the amount stipulated should be payable on the spot and the other half at the end of the season, unless some other arrangement is unavoidable. If they are not prepared to let us in for presents on this scale, but make absurd demands such as did Ubaid bin Juraa last year, it will mean that we shall not get in at all. What we should be paying for is one season’s uninterrupted access, facilities for mapping, use of cars, etc. Guards and labour hired locally will be paid at generous daily rates. It should be emphasized that there is no question of 'finding oil' this year and therefore nobody need worry about ultimate royalties. If this letter leaves you doubtful upon any point about which you desire assistance, please cable before leaving for Abu Dhabi. Yours sincerely B.H.

The Shaikh of Umm al Quwain left yesterday for Falaj al Ali and also hopes to meet Mohamed. Both the Bani Kitab and the al bu Shamis have recently given presents of camels to Ibn Saud. In each case they only received a few hundred rupees in exchange and the R.A. tells me that they are very disgruntled at this treatment and have stated that they will not pay their respects again. Rashid bin Hamid of the Al bu Sharais and his brother Mohamed went personally to meet Ibn Saud at Qatif. Mohamed bin Ali of the Bani Kitab sent ’Amr bin Metaweh. This man is one of the two very 'anti-nasrani' men we met together in the fort of Sultan bin Salem at Ras al Khaimah. They crossed over to Bahrain with Ibn Saud f s party and remained throughout the visit. The R.A. has also told me that he met some of the officials of the Sultan of Muscat on the B.I. boat. The Sultan has grown a waist length beard and is now always surrounded by religious men. It appears that his intention is toThe R.A. was also told that the Sultan now openly declares that Baraimi Oasis is part of his domains 'except few spots owned by Abu Dhabi'. It remains to be seen what the Al bu Shamis and Na'im will have to say when they hear this. •-jr r-p «• V Yours sincerely (Sgd.) B.H. Lermitte London S.H.

E.C.2 Dear Mr. Peel, I send you herewith copy of minutes of the meeting, or meetings, held between Messrs. Weightman and Lermitte at Bahrain on April 27th to 30th. I have already referred to these in telephone conversation with Mr. G-ibson and expressed to him certain fears which I feel regarding the suggested demarkation between the Trucial Coast area and that of the Sultanate of Muscat. Mr. 7/eightman suggests approaching from the Trucial Coast, and via Trucial Coast Rulers, certain areas and tribes which last year we approached through Liu sc at and which undoubtedly the Sultan of LIuscat would claim as his. May there not be some danger that such action will alienate the Sultan from the Company both in this and in other parts of his territory? It was my suggestion to Mr. Gibson that perhaps after receiving the Political Resident’s comments, you might be willing to let me come and discuss the matter with you together with any other questions which may seem to need discussion before next season’s plans become final.

This embraces detailed mapping of the Faiyah, Rodha, Aqdar, Hafit and Ibri structures located within the above area occupied by the Beni Kaab, Beni kitab, Na f im and A1 bu Shamis tribes. 2. A geophysical survey within the area bounded on the west by the Qatar-Abu Dhabi frontier, on the north by the Persian Gulf, on the south by the Abu Dhabi-Saudi Arabia frontier and on the east by the foothills along the western Oman mountain front. 5. A reconnaissance geological examination on the ground of the area bounded approximately by the lattitude of Dhank-Muscat on the north,2 M parallel 22 degrees north lattitude on the south, the sand-covered area on the west and the Oman mountain front on the east. 4. Additional geological and possibly geophysical surveys along the Gulf of Oman coast, northwest of Muscat. 5. An examination on the ground of the stratigraphy exposed in the large cirque in the Jebel Sham between Ibri and Muscat. 6. Possibly flights over (3) above. 7. Possibly also further flights along the south coast, for which landing grounds at Shuwamiyah and Masirah would be required, and particularly the latter. We shall not be surprised if you tell us that some parts of the areas above specified must still remain out of bounds, but hope very much that this will not apply to the interesting structures mentioned in item (1). It is to be remembered that our not very successful efforts to penetrate that area in November, 193&amp; were made before we had obtained a concession from the Shaikh of Aim Dhabi, whose good offices we shall hope to enjoy this year, instead of his opposition.

Obtaining exploration permits from inland rulers in territory theoretically covered by Trucial Shaikhs might seem to recognise their independence with possible undesirable political results and creation of bad precedent stop You should therefore consult Political Agent Bahrain regarding form of agreement if any to be made with Bani Chittab stop We favour simple present in return for services of guides and escorts during next season and would offer anything between Rs. 5*000 and Rs. 10,000 for this preferably half in arrears stop Please consult and comment.” We expect, therefore, that consultations will take place between our local representatives and Mr. Weightman, of which we shall await information with much interest.JfM &lt; l -i - The Jebel Faiyah territory which, to our cost, we know to be very effectively controlled by Mohammed bin Ali bin Huwaidir, the Shaikh of the Bani Chittab, is not very extensive, but has a certain geological interest. The Shaikh of Sharjah who, as you know, claims suzerainty over it, has been unable to secure access for us ov/ing to the refusal of the Bani Chittab to admit his authority. Faced with this position he is not very willing that we should enter at all, but it is doubtful whether his ill-will will be any more effective than his good-will.ru 'VL.i.m 'V’r TELEPHONE : NATIONAL 3S82 TELEGRAMS INLAND foRe’? : ^ETtONCESS, EINSQUARE, LONDON fcEfGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON \lpH &gt;0 Ho (IU) CODES pj*' P.Z'. 1974 BE BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE ' JUJ T LEY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT ; r LOMBARD PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL (COAST) LIMITED l2o DIRECTORS n r *a n tr G.

It has not yet been ascertained why reconnaissances iurther to the south i.e. from irasirah» Ihor Gharim^uhuwai- miyah and idurbat as originally planned were not carried out. An unconfirmed report received states that tne oheuch of ^asirah refused to allow the Company's aeroplane to use the landing ground on that island and tore up the Sultan* s letter of introduction which had been sent him. xeraonally I do not believe this report to be true. According to the Company's local agents however the real reason for the postponement of the flights to tne south ern portion of the Sultanate was that it i&amp;s found that the motor dhow hired as a tender vessel las unsuitable for the purpose. It is believed that a Tanker will be hired for the Koric in place of the dhow. On December 26th the Company* s aeroplane arrived in aiuseat from Sharjah. On December 27th the Company'a Arabic interpreter than Sahib Hasan bin Saleh J&amp;af&amp;r came to the Agency and aa*cd the assistance of the Treasury Officer in obtaining permission from the sultan's Hepresen- tative for the aeroplane to fly over the Bstinah which, he stated, had been refused. The Treasury Officer accordingly went and interviewed S&amp;iyid Shahab on the matter, who in formed him that he had refused permission not for a flight over tie Batxnah, as stated, but over the Oman. This per mission he declared he could not give, firstly because the Sultan had given him no instructions on the subject and secondly because it would be a dangerous undertaking the responsibility for txie possible consequences of which he, Saiyid Shanab, was not prepared to assume. Meanwhile it seems without waiting to hear the decision of the Sultan's Representative the aeroplane, in which Hr. Thompson, senior geologist and a photographer named Mr. Eden were tne passengers, took off from the landing ground and carried out a flight of some two hours duration into the3- mto the interior, Oman. This no doubt tooic them well over the On December 27th Mr. HotchJciss, geologist, a mechanic from the aeroplane and Khan Sahib Hasan bin Salih lei t for oharjah by the Up Mail steamer and Mr. Thompson the and Mr. Eden followed by aeroplane^/next day. it is understood that the geologists intend to return to Muscat to discuss their future plans with the Sultan on His Highness’s return this month about 13th instant. This report has been compile a from information obtained with some difficulty by the Treasury Officer(during my absence from Muscat from 9th December to 1st January) , partly from the members of the geological party and partly irom other sources. It appears that the Company is not Keeping this Agency or the Muscat Government fully inforned of their plans and proposed movements in the dultanate. That such information should be always given is of course ox real importance and you might perhaps care to remind Xongrigg of his obligations in this respect. Sd. R.P. WATTS.

Mr. Thompson gave me to understand that he had reported his opinion to the Head Office of his Company who were certain to agree with his views and that it could be as Bused that no further aerial surveys would be carried out over the area in question. 3* Should Mr. Thompson* s assumption be corgect and the Company in fact (Signature) S. 44.

The plan now proposed* according to Mr.Thompson was for a thorough aerial survey to be carried out oi Dhofar rrovince using i«urbat as a base. The scheme apparently is to convey stores, supplies and personnel to Murbat from Muscat in a West Bound Tanker which will not remain at that port but proceed to whatever its destination may be. On the comple tion of the survey evacuation of the temporary base to Muscat will be carried out by a Tanker bound for Abadan. The Com- pani|Ji 8 aeroplane will of course fly to Murbat. Actual details of the exploratory work to be carried out are to be discussed by the geologists with the Sultan on the latter’s return to Muscat on 13th of this month• 6 , I can see no objection to that item in the pro posed scheme of exploration of Dhofar whereby no steamer or ship will be used to remain the whole time at Murbat. The Company's party will be in wireless comaunication with the Royal Air yorce Station at Muscat, Dhofar province is peace ful and the inhabitants law-abiding and docile and in the event of a forced landing of the aeroplane in the interior the Sultan has more than once stated to me that he could in that district arrange for a rescue party to be despatched fromlo ^ti)i 11* aomtAd^ -vo^iau 90 XiXir ijca oidLoax lo ^diuoa 4 *kbnl C3(j «mruoX»^ titox dJx^ ^aibuo 99 j&amp; obiir &amp;e ■Hi lytfmTOA xttfcg lo fiS 1 S,qi 90 x 1 * 1 - ••••■ x* a- j - ■.; ‘50 ^.v j b*mrt&amp;*o &gt;igz- x •io-.- •a.- -tisH oJ jiiiV oua Pfo •J9i&gt;n90 iJ 6X5 fcdtliJ vfOiiib lO^Q^ 9a't 10 ii boj’ojjp asjj’sx aa9T'-;xo yx 'ic £ J cdrsil -jui '^n. 1 f rc.-&gt; •&gt;?»:*;&gt;•» m** \c- *0 ioO .?o ; :i Mt* \o faj&amp; 10 i 3.92LeuB? 4 ’lol ^^sjeuite aoc^axoilT♦! -1 ^altnoocis t Jaooo^cnc wraa. n.sia aril .c i.-'l«aic. “to itio l'^ij.%£i' $4 oj x^vims 3 10 'i *m si aci^dos o*.‘:. .oxud* 3 a*: ^oaxvo'i'i !* 0 u&gt;- Moil ^Adwiu ioaiiOa'j 0 ^ ans s^xio^wa c \3v^oo oi J ii f i j 'iosi z aiiS $b i\iii&amp;$''i $ on ili* iioiiiw %&amp;*&amp;#$ bavok j ao'; « ai -9lqaro9 srlf aj .aJ xaffl aoijjeuti^s^ #J 1 ?$?*£»&amp;* oj iieaoo'Xi o J oesd &lt;# i 3 ‘io^aioJ ^#i *3 lo noi^^tosvd xsvxiia »xU lo noil -:£‘0&amp; 90 T •n^vOOA 101 CUtK'ti r XOXiljaT £ V* ^XJO aoxi'l^O :.0 HXtf . .,„»... ttj-f au o! xi^l^ol^xa joJ lo axiaroo IzlJoJ, »&amp; ,J l* 6S&lt;ii$G±o&amp;% x# oB i&amp;metiy otf os on* jro 0»l'n ^0 ax.il lo ill IX ;vj ul ft*tj'#S'X 6 ,# X9 j j X dtil *10 i1'£d iGw • -oaq oitr ax aol x Inxil ol uoiaostdo on 393 a,..o i .0 4 io rauzAsSa on ^cfaioxfw lolonCi lo noil^iolqxo lo c&amp;srioa fcoRoq 1 .- eloilw or&gt;3 ai&amp;siz'i &amp;t »o IIiw qiita oil id iat iit?iifloi.ti« iaHOfe» c?«9l^iiw £il 9ti Xix«r vrio&lt;i 3 , xnxMiieD si ©cxi iv 314 U3xoxi&lt;I .o^Le- ij? a oil *$&amp; ©010^ ii.A »iy «1 iaae oiioo© o$xa ia.nrijnx ©xil jwwr xui '♦oX'l^flX © al -xa-Uv^oaoiS o£ii 10 ^xii n.ii x^oiol a lo ai h£l oik on 3 MS 9ffl 0# 9GXiO tVJO^i a^fi *|f^XiJ6 ©ilt r;© clo*-Sjoojq ©c oj ^ji.s4 ©Goesi 3 10 x ©j^iATid It. i'Uaik 1^1'3t g ■» 3 • from Murtoat or Salalah. 7 .

I pointed out to Mr. Thompson that as he had, quite correctly, sent his Interpreter beforehand to the Sultans representative to as* permission for this flight he should undoubtedly have waited for a reply before actually making it. Such acts, I added, were not con ducive to promote cordial relations between the Company and the Sultan* s Government. Ur. Thompson’s reply to my remarKB were was somewhat evasive. q. On 8 th January, the Company’s aeroplane in which Mr. HotchJciss geologists and Mr. Eden photographer were passengers arrived in Muscat from Sharjah and returned the following day.

He was told that provided the agreement did not in any way interfere with the Shaikhs’ treaties with the British G-overnment he could seek the co-operation of the other Shaikhs who would willingly do so if they saw it was to their advantage without persuasion from us.

Howea has produced an excellent -and interesting report which adds considerably to our knowledge of Baraimi, and which should prove most valuable when Petroleum Concessions Limited make a fresh attempt to explore the interior. In the event of a major war too if enemy agents penetrate to the Truci?il Coast hinterland, and endeavour to stir up the tribes against us on the Trucial Coast (with the object for instance of cuttir our Air Route), and against the Sultan of Muscat (as they did in the Creat 7/ar), any information which we can obtain of the interior is obviously useful. 3. To clear the ground of seme extraneous matter - extran eous ^ha^ is to say to the subject immediately under considera tion - the exploration of Petroleum Concessions Limited. In Paragraph III (d) his report Howes makes a brief mention of lavery in the Baraimi Oasis. That slaves were sold in Baraimi does not come as a surprise, we have had information of this before, but the numbers quoted by Howes &amp; 3 i H probably H one thousand per annum appear to me very large. I have written to /eightman asking for certain further details, and will then R.T.Peel Esquire, M.

Howes* paragraph III (b) mentions that there are a large number of rifles and ammunition in the Oasis. Further enquiries are bd ng made in this direction. 6* To turn to the actual Petroleum Concessions Limited’s exploration. As far as its immediate object of exploration went it has been a failure. The Muscat party sponsored by the Sultan covered a considerable distance before it reached Baraimi, via the Batineh Coast - Ibri - Yanqul and Label Hafit, but as it travelled fairly fast was able to do little real exploration en route. After having met the Trucial Coast party it returned from Baraimi to Muscat via Sohar to carry out its aerial exploration of the Has al Hadd - Murbat area (see correspondence ending with my telegram H o.379 of the 29th November 1938). The Trucial Coast party sponsored by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi went straight, up from that place to Baraimi. Thence they proceeded 'ey motor for about hours south under the auspices of the Wall of sohar (Muscat) when they met the Muscat party. After a day’s work or sc on Lebel Hafit they returned to Baraimi with the Muscat party and after abortive negotiations to proceed south wards lasting for some two weeks returned to Abu Dhabi. Their u / total /-3- total stay the Baralmi area •/as about three weeks* 7 a Teightman and Howes between them give detailed reasons for the failure of the ejcplorat ion# Broadly speaking I think these were as follows# The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi lays claim to a part of Baraimi, and wields considerable influence there# The Sultan of Muscat is in a similar position# But neither of these potentates can wield either full suzerainty, or full influence, over the whole of the Oasis# There was therefore a clash of interests between these two potentates, each sponsoring one of the parties# On the other hand if it had not been for the Sultan being first in the field with hie promise to get his party into Baraimi, I doubt whether the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi would ever have assisted the party to go through his territory# The latter’s attitude on this point until he heard that the Sultan was sponsoring a party was that of obstinate refusal. On hearing this news, however, his natural reaction must have been that if he left the field clear to the Sultan’s party his own claim to Baraimi might, in our view, go by default - at any rate to some extent# I have no doubt whatever therefore that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi gave confidential instructions to his representative, who accompanied the Trucial Coast party, that he was to take them | to Baraimi, but after that to allow them to move about as little as possible. 8# Besides the Sultan of Muscat and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi there are various Shaikhs of local tribes (see Appendix III of Howes’ report)# Some of these acknowledge the influence of the sultan, and some that of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, while others /I II others appear to be independent of both* Some o.l :hese local elements are almost incredibly primitive (vide paragraph III (e) of Howes 1 report), and all are imbued with the innate sus picion and fear which all ttibal elements have of European visits, which they look upon in the light of visitations leading to the loss of their independence, which in point of fact has quite often followed© Such fears and suspicions are generally most in evidence in the early contacts with European visitors, whether official or unofficial, and in the present instance though Petroleum concessions Limited’s geologists had paid a short visit to Baraimi in May 1937 they did not succeed in reaching some of the areas visited by the present parties* Howes is therefore substantially correct in saying (vide para graph III ( e) of his report) that no European has been to Baraimi since Co^’s visit in 1905, and of course no party at all on the scale of the present parties has ever visited Baraimi. The attitude of the local tribes towards these parties is best summed up in the words of some elders quoted by Howes in an earlier report: M We don’t want your oil, we don’t want your money, we don’t like your cars. We’re quite content with our camels, our dates, and our old way of life.” It is possioly inevitable that the old way of life in the hinterland may have to pass, as it has in all Arab lands, but in the meantime the attitude of the local tribes is quite a reasonable one which claims a good deal of one’s sympathy. If I had, in order to account for the failure of the exploration, to pick on one main cause underlying the welter of intrigue, and play of personalities of ghaikhs and others, described by Weightman and Howes, I should choose the psychological factor of this local fear and suspicion. The reasons .for the failureS' -5- of the exploration in the 3eni Kitab country are given in paragraph 4 of '7eightman*3 letter,. 9» Amongst the more specific causes mentioned by ./eightman for the non-success of the exploration is the failure of the Company to distribute adequate monetary presents (see paragraph 3 (ii) of his letter)* On this point Weightman writes* ’•They (the local tribes) therefore made excuses for not conducting the second party through their territories, and the only inducement which might have been effective, namely immediate payments on a large scale, was not forthcoming. I ccnfess that I had originally thought that once the company’s geologists were in touch with the Na’ira and the a! 3u Shamis Shaikhs they would be able to travel without undue difficulty in their territories, but I had anticipated that adequate induce ment would be offered to them.' It is true that the sum of 33*50,000/- asked by the Beni Ka’ab for permission to explore ( paragraph IV of Howes* report) was exorbitant, but the sum that the party had to pay for one day’s work at Jebel Hafit Rs.70/~ (see the same paragraph of Howes* report) though large was not out of all proportion to the end in view. Longrigg has always laid stress on the fact that the Company’s parties, if once we got than into the hinterland, would buy this way from place to place from the local Shaikhs, and he gave us to understand that the actual period which the Party would want to stay in any one place for purpose of a preliminary exploration would not be more than say four or five days* For this period the total, even at Rs.70/- per diem, in any one area would not work out at more than J?is, ^00 - which in /- 6 - in comparison with the iasaea at stake, and the large sums which the Co^pQ-^y are prepared to pay for their concessions, is not excessive# If the party had been prepared to pay out in cash up to say Rs.4000/- - not a large sun - to the minor local Shaikhs it seems to me that they might have been able to do somewhat more exploration# 10* With regard to the presence of a Political Officer with the Trucial Coast party, Weightman in another letter gives the following opinion based on reports from Howes* n The Trucial Coast party might quite well have found themselves unable to move even from Abu Dhabi to Baraimi but for his o.vn presence with them as representative of (Bahrain) the Political Agent^hom the Shaikh had promised to conduct anywhere he chose to go in Abu Dhabi territory. Similarly the party’s stay in Baraimi would probably have been very much shorter. 11 I quite concur, [further, I have no doubt that the presence of a Political Officer with the party was a distinct asset in ensuring that though it met with obstruction at any rate no act of open hostility was displayed against it# A most important consideration. 11. Even though Petroleum Concessions Limited f s venture to Baraimi has been a failure from the point of view of actual exploration I am certainly not of opinion that it has been wasted. Briefly, as in previous cases of opening up of the Trucial Coast, the ice has been broken. There is indeed nothing new or particularly surprising in the opposition at present displayed towards oil exploration. All phases of the opening up of the Trucial Coast which have taken place during the last ten /-7- 7 (iso) iV?- ten years or so have met, in their initial stages, with the same difficulties. Nowadays for example we take the Air Route along the Trucial Coast for granted, but I can remember only some 8 years ago that when this scheme was first mooted the opposition to it amongst the coastal Shaikhs was even stronger than that now shown against oil exploration in the interior, and the welter of local intrigue that went on was even greater, A definite anti-air combine was formed by the Shaikhs by which each bound himself not to grant any facilities in his area f the underlying cause of this opposition being precisely the same as that against oil exploration - a fear by the Shaikhs and their people of encroachments on their territories and their liberties. It took my predecessor - Blscoe - many months of hard and patient negotiations to break down this opposition, and persuade the Shaikh of Sharjah to leave the ccmb-ne and give the facilities required. The Shaikh finally did this only with the utmost reluctance, and with considerable apprehension that in doing so he was risking his 3Lhaikhship and his life - either at the hands of his own people or of the neighbouring Shaikhs. As time passed, however, and the Trucial Coast saw that we made no attempt on the basis of our air facilities to impose a close administration or closer control on Sharjah, local public opinion completely veered round, and before very long the ohaikh Oa Debal, seeing the considerable financial advantages which Sharjah was obtaining in return for facilities which he had given, vvas actually asking us if we could not move our air port from Sharjah to Debai J I have no doubt that in the end we shall get our “oil fac ilit iee’\ i, e, full exploration in the inter?, or,in the same way that we got our air facilities. The fact /fact that two parties of Petroleum Concessions Limited have actually penetrated to Baraimi, have moved about to the limited extent possible, have made contacts with the local Shaikhs .jn^ have been able to withdraw without any hostile demonstration being made against them, is much to the gooi* fe have also acquired valuable information as to local personalities, conditions and the particular difficulties to he overcome. Al - this should assist us materially when the second attempt of Petroleum Concessions Limited for exploring the hinterland is made® 12® Another advantage which we have gained by the present expedition seems to me that it provides a reply to the Ameriaan oil interests in case they should propose exploring the interior* If we had sent no party into the interior they might have argued that we were adopting a dog in the manger attitude, i*e. that while making no effort to explore the interior ourselves we prevented than from doing so* The fact that parties of Petroleum concessions Limited have actually visited the hinterland provides a good answer to any such argument* 13* In regard to when the second attempt at Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration should be made, Weightman in his paragraph 5 says that Longrigg’s present feeling is that all hopes this year of ground exploration must be abandon ed* I am inclined to agree, and to be of the opinion that | we had better let the hinterland settle down after the recent Petroleum concession Limited^ visit and postpone any further exploration until the autumn of this year. This applies t&gt;nly9 -9- irz) t© ground exploration* There i» no reason why the Company, when they have finished their Has al Hadd - Mur bat aerial survey, should not make a similar survey of, at any rate part of, the hinterland. Whether they can do this, and to what extent, will have to be considered later. 14.

I have the honour to forward herewith n copy of an admirable brief report submitted by Captain Howes, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, describing the .loumey he made in company with one of Petroleum Concession* Limited 1 s geolo rical parties, noting on the country and people, and estimating the causes for the failure of the venture, 9. Uy own comments should, I think, be confined to the lost point, namely the reasons why the plans for geological exploration in the hinterland have failed. *hile I am f*ir from questioning the importance of the contributory causes mentioned by Ceptain TIowes in his last paragraph, I think that there have been other predominant factors. It will be well to distinguish between the two substanticlly separate parts of the exploration programme, n mely that in the teraimi- Hafit-Bhahira area, and t*i*t in the Beni Kltab country between BarMmi and dhald. 3. In regard to the former the determining factors h ve(1) clash of interest hstwssn Abu ^hobl «nd I4useat| (11) th* failure of the Company to distribute ad^uate monetwry presents; end (ill) the over-a labor at ion of the Company 1 s plans* It will be rarenabered that the original plan f as described In India Office demi-official letter tfo. P#*. 5736/38 dated the SOth August 1938 f was for a party of geologists to work up from the Muscat side towards 3*raimi f and there to be met by a second motorised unit, the combined party then moving northwards towards the Coast (through the 3eni Kitab country). The »etu»l plan attempted was for one party of geologists to proceed rapidly from the Batineh Co«st via Ibri *md Yanqul to 8 firaimi, where the second party accom panied by Captain Howes had arrived a few days earlier; end it wrs then intended that the second party should proceed in a southerly direction, apparently over much the same route as the first party but conducting more detailed geo logical exploration. Meanwhile the first pfurty was to pro ceed to the Batineh Coast at Sober* hat actually occurred was that the halt&amp;n of r uac^t mrde ©rr-ang^enta for the first party to be con iucted rapidly up to Baralmi; he paid out small sums of money to the Shaikhs through whose terri tories the psrty was to proceed, those sums (as far os I can ascertain) approximating to the normal charge for safe conduct in transit of the 'hare*** of any particular tribe; and in feet that party passed through at the maxisiuia speed of their camels, seeing practically nothing, but exhausting | the good-will for which the 'ult/*n of Puacat had paid. kesnwhUe insufficient time had been allowed for arrangements to be «*de with the eni Kltato for the Mlliamaon-Hawea party to proceed to Beraimi through Beni Kltsb country. (It Is needless to elaborate the »rg\inent that such negotiations take/--3- •3 1*56. take not days or weeks but months). They therefore had to proceed to Usreiml with the aid r*nd protection of the 'Shaikh of Abu Ohebi. tfo payment was made for this service 9 but unfortunately simultaneous negotiations with the 'haikh of ^bu Dhabi for s landing ground near Beraimi broke down owing to the extravagant demands made by the lisikh* Nego- and OMsequently the atmosphere in Abu Dh*bi at the time when the uilli^msorv-Howee party left w*s one of unsatisfied greed and of resentment that a second party wes approaching Bareimi froh the south under Muscat auspices through the territory of tribes which for £iany years have been under the Deni fa’ob? ?heir mental background is well depicted in Ceptain Howes' Conclusions, fhey had performed the ser vice for which they had been paid by the Sultan of Ftaac^t and they saw no fhrthar lerge sums of money coming their weyj to sny hints that it would be better for them to do no more* Th^y therefore made excuses for not conducting the s econd party through their territories f and the only inducement which might h&amp;ve been effective 9 namely Immediate payments originally thought that once the Company's geologists were in touch with the tfa'lia «nd the Al 3hrmis .Sheikhs they would be able to trrvel without undue difficulty in their would be offered to them. 4# I have h^d no final report yet from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, or from Petroleum Concessions Limited's representatives on the Coat recounting for the failure tlatIons for a concession in ~bu Dhabi were still pending, strong Abu ahsbi influence. How then did all these forces react on the Na'im, Al Su :&gt;haais and other tribes such as they were nervous of Abu Dh*bi and only too ready to listen on a large scale, w&amp;s not forthcoming• I confess that I had territories, but I hM anticipated thnt adequate inducemaar* to/to arrange for • perty to p« 8 S through Haai Kitab territory aae to oxplore Jebel ?«iyth f but the reasons rref I think t not very far to seek* Broadly, they can be put as follows:- (a) Insufficient time for negotiations; (b) Intense suspicion on the part of shaikh Mohammad bin All; (c) Intensive intrigue by some of the Truclsl Coast ihaikhg, in particular* Sharjah| See al Khalmah and Abu Ohsbl. On the first point I no ad not rene^it wb&amp;t I have already said. On the second it is to be rerembered th?it Shaikh Vohemroad bln All ©nd the ^eni Kltsb are completely wild f&gt;nd Ignorant* They have herrd s tori as that the object of an ex pedition would be to establish foreign donin-ition In their country and to locate sm aerodrome there* Their fears have been played on by those of the Trucial Corst r haikhs who believe It to be in their interest to prevent exploration in and around Jebel Faiyah; nnl the suspicions that have been put into their a ini a hr/e included doubts of the genuine friendship of 3haikh Khalld, the negotiator* The latter*e influence over ihalkk ^ohomriad bin All has proved to be less than we had anticipated, though I still believe that In the course of time he will be able to brim about th* desired result. At the moment however intrigue, emanating an inly from ohsrjah, has destroyed all sense of proportisn in the ieni Kitfb, and i% will be months before it is possible to overcome the effect which thsit intrigue, combined with natural antipathy towards ’’Christians' * has had on the minds of the Shaikh and his advisers. 5* I shall reserve my reco/snendrtions for the future until I have had an opportunity of meeting Hr.

Reference paragraph 2 of Summary No. 18. On 26th November the Muscat Geological party joined forces at Hafit with the party of geologists belonging to the same Company who had started from Abu Dhabi. On 28th November both parties proceeded to Baraimi in which neighbourhood it is proposed that the party from the Trucial Coast will stay to carry out further examination of the ground before returning to their base while the Muscat party are due to proceed via Sohar to Muscat in the first week of December to commence their operations in the south of the Sultanate. On 8 th November in the Wadi Hawasanah about 30 miles west of Khaburah some shots were fired on the Sheikh of the District who was accompanying the geologists. This incident was however found to be entirely due to a private feud and no hostility was shown to the members of the party itself. The matter has since been satisfactorily settled by the Sultan. Up to the end of the period under review the geologists have met with friendliness in all the districts so far visited.Ou, »x&lt;ra*7 i \ ’ Confidential * ^ ?&gt; o no i p:^: 7829 ffS? 1 1938 14 Cl5(^5S -^Tiie Residency, 1^ Buehire, the 7th November, 1938. 0 &gt;No« 564«»S* Could you please refer to correspondence ending with India Office telegram No*1826, dated the 18th October 1938, on the subject of Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration. 2.

Mohamad bin Ali is the Shaikh of the Bani Kitab through whose territory the Sharjah party propose to pass on their way to Baraimi (though there is a route through Abu Dhabi if the shaikh of that place will assist), and in whose territory one of the sites which Petroleum Concessions Limited wish to explore, Jabal Faiyah, is situated. He is therefore a key man.

Present: Mr. J.C. Walton Sir T. Fowle Mr. A. C. B. Symon Mr. Longrigg ) \ Representing P.C.L. Mr. Williamson ) 1. Mr. Weightman*s letter No. 0.500 of the 3rd September, was used as the basis of the discussion. A copy of the letter was shown to Mr. Longrigg and he was allowed to take notes therefrom. He was informed that we concurred generally with the views expressed by Mr. Weightman. 2. Mr. Longrigg confirmed that there would be two exploration parties, one leaving Muscat for Baraimi about 3rd November and the other leaving Sharjah for the same destination about 7th-10th November. It was anticipated that the Sharjah party (travelling in motor cars) would reach Baraimi a few days ahead of the Muscat party. The party will probably travel from Sharjah via Dhaid, and thence southerly in a more or less straight line to Baraimi, passing east of Jebel Paijah and west of Jebel Shamami. The exact route to be followed will depend to some extent on the physical difficulties to be overcome. 3. It was agreed that Major Watts should accompany the Muscat party as far as Barairai, and that Captain Galloway should accompany the Sharjah party andIt is understood that Major Watts* future plans include a visit to G-wadur on 16th October to try an important case* Sir T* Powle thought that this might have to be postponed* remain with it until the work was completed. It was recognised that this may be a matter of months* The Company’s representatives expressed their agreement in these arrangements and undertook to provide the necessary transport. It was impressed upon the Company*s representatives that the exploration parties must be guided by the advice of the Political Officer concerned as to whether any particular area which they wished to visit could be regarded as safe* Sir Trenchard Powle said that subject to this overriding consideration and to the general guidance of the Political Officers, it seemed unnecessary to place any restrictions on the movements of the parties* Sir Trenchard Powle will, on his return from leave y take such steps as are necessary /to make Captain Galloway available, and will issue the necessary instructions to Major Watts. Sir Trenchard thought it would be preferable if Major Watts returned to Muscat by the 18th October '** in order to be present when Mr. Longrigg arrives*^ - 4* Mr* Longrigg said that he would prefer not to ask any favours from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi before the Sheikh had been again approached in regard to the concession aspect* In any case, the Company’s experts were of the opinion that on this occasion it might be unnecessary to visit any territory controlled by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and they were hopeful that the landing site could be found in an area slightly to the east of Jebel Ha^fit, which is outside Abu Dhabi’s control. The Company preferred to make local contact with the Abu Dhabi people, if such contact was found to be necessary. Sir Trenchard Powle said that, so far asf 3. deferred to in paragraph 7 of Mr. Weightma^s letter. he was concerned, he was prepared to agree to this# 5. As regards the Jebel Faijah area, it was agreed that if the negotiations^ between the Beni Kitab and Sheikh Khalid (acting on behalf of the Sheikh of Sharjah) failed, it should be left to Sheild\Khalid acting directly on behalf of the Company , to try and obtain access to the Jebel Faijah and adjacent territory# If this is done, it will be necessary to decide what steps should be taken with the Sheikh of Sharjah. Two courses appeared to be open, viz.- (a) To tell the Sheikh at once that the Company had invoked Article 10 of the political agreement, and were making other arrangements (with the consent of the Political Resident) to visit the precluded areas, or (b) to say nothing to the Sheikh unless he himself objected at a later stage. L Mr. Longrigg said that the Company were 1 n~ravour—e^-the second course, and Sir a Trenchard Fowle undertook to discuss the matter with Mr. Weightman on his return to the Gulf.j fcfa \&lt;Ap' ^ f'ft. ^ *f)UALUc 1*1* ) Mr. Gitson, P.C.L. Exploration. !• The first point I want to stress in this connection is the importance on Imperial strategic grounds of assisting in every v/ay the efforts of the P.C.L. to find oil in the Trucial Coast and Muscat territory. In the event of a major war the continuous supply of oil from Abadan, in my opinion, is by no means certain, a point I have stressed more than once, and this being so additional and alternative supplies of oil on the other side of the Gulf are of the first importance. 2. To turn to the specific points at the end of Mr. Symon’s note of the 14th September on which my views are re quire d:- (a) I agree with Mr. Weightman that an approach to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi would be useful and I think this should be made by the Company. We have already approached the Sheikh asking for his co-operation in getting the Company into the Baraimi area (Idid it personally on one of my tours) and met with a firm refusal and I do not think it would be good policy for us again to approach the Sheikh - Mr. 'Weightman believes that there would be a fair chance of negotiations with the Shdkh on this point being successful. It is possible that the Sheikh’s attitude is changed ov/ing to the news which he has doubtless received that a party is arriving in the Baraimi area or Muscat and also by reason of the fact that for the present he and his State are deprived of travel facilities in connection v/ith his slave trading activities. The pearl diving comes to an end shortly when Abu Dhabi merchants will want to visit Bahrein and India in connection with/lotrviXS VkCCtWv tU ^r\ flu. •'tt s(a*J\, • “Ua^u*^ . with the sale of* their pearls. We might consider trie restoring of travel facilities in return for his co-opei*ation to assist the Company in their exploration. However* this can he gone into later when the result of the Company s approach to him is known. (b) I agree generally with Mr. Jeightma^s viev/s as given at in paragraph 7 of his letter. I think, however, that we might do it on the lines suggested nrv».&lt;_ previously by him by using Article 10 of the Sharjah Concession with the P.C.L. (c) I think it is essential that a Political Officer should accompany the exploration party and for this purpose an officer who has a good working knowledge of Arabic is essential. Captain Galloway, my present Secretary at Bushire, is being relieved by Major Ryan shortly and is due to go on leave. Captain Galloway knows Arabic well and for a large part of last winter was on duty in the Trucial Coast. He would be an excellent choice for the work in Question and I am sure would not mind postponing his leave in order to take up this important and interesting work. I suggest that a telegram be sent to the Government -f~ affrufvek, of India suggesting that Captain Galloway be put on duty for this purpose. As the two exploration parties from the Muscat and the Trucial Coast side arrive in Baraimi simultaneously, it will of course not be possible for Captain Galloway to accompany both and as the Tpucial Cos&amp; side is the more difficult it is that party that he should accompany. With regard to the Muscat party it would be useful to have a Political Officer with it and the Sultan might be asked if he has any objections to Major Watts accompanying it. Major Watts could return to Muscat from Baraimi. Captain Galloway would stay with the/2-cQ % 3. /V' the combined exploration party until their work was concluded. Sometime ago the Air Officer Commanding Iraq. said that he would be glad to send an R.A.F. Officer 3 with ane^he-r exploration party with a view to getting information likely to be useful to the R.A.F. There is an Air Liaison Officer at Bahrein with a knowledge of Arabic and the possibility of this Officer accompanying /aJiS' the Trucial Coast party might be considered^ 3. It is possible that the Company may not be able to come to any arrangements with Abu Dhabi. If this is the case then if the Company like to continue with their plans and risk the chance of not being able to explore Abu Dhabi territory, I see no objection to their proceeding to Baraimi and trying their luck by the process of local negotiation and paying their way, which Mr. Longrigg has suggested. I would only agree to this, however, if the exploration party were accompanied by a Political Officer and that the Company agreed that their party would be entirely guided by his advice as to their movements. - c. t xri^JZ*, L 17090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 2/0- air Draft Paper. politi cal Department.

If we come to appoint a permanent agent in Muscat we will, of course, give every weight to the Sultan's wishes. If our operations (in so far as concerns Muscat itself, or our relations with the Ruler) assume any importance, we shall no doubt have a European representative, as is indeed encumbent upon us under our Political Agreement with H.M.G. At the moment the chief task is the distribution of aviation petrol and oil to the various landing grounds on the south coast which we expect to use. As Mohammid bin Nassib k Co. are agents for the Ahglo-Iranian Oil Co. (who supply the petrol etc.) and, I believe, for the R.A.F., it is more or less inevitable that they should act for us in this capacity, and are actually doing so under arrangements already made. Certain stores and equipment for the use of our geological party have already been consigned to us at Muscat, c/o Mohammid bin Nassib. That is the extent to which, so far, they have become our agents. The expedition, after once having left Muscat, will be based much more upon Sharjah, and I do not think that any agency of ours in Muscat itself will have any importance. It is certainly a sad blow that you will not be in Muscat on October 18th. I think I must stick to this date as all arrangements have been made on the basis of it. Will there, I wonder, be any chance of contacting with you at Karachi or at Gwadur? I hatePETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QI^Af? KND DHOFAR) LIMITED. to think that by arriving at Muscat in your absence I shall be something of a nuisance, but do not see how it can be avoided and shall be most grateful for any help. Is there anybody (native of Muscat) whom you could recommend as personal clerk, factotum or orderly? I think I will leave over the subject of the Sultan^ house until I arrive. The geologists will have complete camp and kitchen equipment with them andoouM, therefore occupy it, unfurnished. There will be plenty of time for me to have it cleaned up before they arrive. I am leaving Marseilles by the Narkunda on October 1st, arriving Bombay on the IJth. Letters addressed to me there c/o Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.Ltd., 3, Wittet Road, Ballard Estate will find me, and perhaps you will be good enough to let me have a word from you there. I would gladly step off the slow mall at Gwadur for a day or two but for the fear that you will be preoccupied with other matters and probably also there is no accommodation. We shall meet sooner or later and I am much looking forward to this. Tours sincerely. (Sgd.) S. H. LONGRTGG. R.P.

I i Q ^ Dear Longrigg,'^” 1 Your letter No. PC.27/111 of 26 th August has just reached me here having been forwarded on from Muscat. I have written in officially to the Political Resident regarding your Company being authorised to draw money from the Muscat Treasury and trust no difficulties will arise in this arrangement being sanctioned. I now understand from the Sultan that he would prefer you not to appoint Muhammad Nassib as your Agent in Muscat. The chief reason he gives is that he has recently found out that the proprietor one Muhammad Khan (son of Nassib who is dead), who has been absent in India for the last 18 months or so, has no intention of returning to Muscat for the present and therefore it would not be satisfactory, he considers, for your work to be carried out by the Head Clerk who has been left in charge. There are, as a matter of fact a number of other reasons, which I can if you desire tell you about later, why the Sultan really does not wish Muhammad Nassib appointed as your Agents, but I quite agree that the reason given by him is a valid one. The Sultan suggests you appoint a certain MANDLIA &amp; Co. Muscat as your Agents. I consider this an excellent suggestion; I know the Head of the firm personally and have always found him an able and pleasant man to deal with and he would, I feel certain, do you well. One big advantage to you and possibly to the Agency in having Mandlia as your Agents in place of Muhammad Nassib is that the former is a British subject while the latter is a Muscati. Shouldyou by chance in the meantime have made a contract with Muhammad Nassib to act as your A.gents there will be no difficulty under the circumstances in your cancelling it and I think you will find Mandlia^.quite willing tg take over your2 2. 7 o- work I note in your letter you say that you expect to be in Muscat on October l 8 th. I myself 'shall not be returning there until 2Sth October as there is an important case I have to try at Gwadur. Could you arrange to postpone your arrival by a week? Otherwise I am afraid I shall not be able to accommodate you until the 25 th. There are spare rooms at the Agency where you could stay if you arrived on the 18 th but I could not mess you as my cook and servants are with me. I could probably arrange for your food to be sent over from the Royal Air Force Rest House a few yards from the Agency if you cannot change your date but I think if you can do so you would be more comfortable if you arrived the same day as myself i.e. 25 th. I have not myself seen the house which the Sultan says he will rent to you but from enquiries made I hear that it is quite a good one and suitable with a little cleaning up for European occupation. I think you will be well advised to take it over as decent houses for renting are almost impossible to find in Muscat. You could either write yourself to the Sultan about the house or if it would be of any assistance I would be glad to do so on your behalf since I have already spoken to him about it. At the same time it would be advisable to give instructions for the house to be done up and some essential articles of furniture purchased. The latter will have to be obtained from India and if you would let Mandlia (presumably you are going to appoint him) know your requirements he could be getting busy to have the house all ready for occupation by the time your people arrive. I hope to be here until about the 12th October when I shall be leaving for Gwadur where I shall be from l 6 th to 23rd and arrive back in Muscat on 25 th October. If therefore there is any further information you would like from me and especially if you desire me to rent the house from the Sultan for you will you please write me to the- 3 - above address to reach me here before 12th October.

I must admit that I was not a little surprised when Yatts reported that the Sultan had made arrangements for a party to go up from Khabur&amp;h to Baraimi, for, whatever the Sultan’s claims may be, no one in the area marked on Hunter’s map as Jau, and none of the Ha 1 im or Al bu Shamis in Dhahirah would ever acknowledge that the Sultan exercises spy sort of authority over them® It meant, therefore, quite a heavy outlay of money to buy a passage and I doubted if he would put up enough to overcome local prejudices. On the other hand there have been signs recently of a growing eagerness in the back areas to share in the profits which oil, or the smell of oil, seems to bring, and in the summer communications reached me from two important Shaikhs of the Baraimi-Hafit area, offering their services in any way required® It is now apparent from reports received both from 'iYatts and from the Trucial Coast that one of these, namely, Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Al bu Khur&amp;ib&amp;n M Ha* im. Shaikh of the Na’im village of Baraimi, is the man by whose aid the Sultan now expects to get the party up to Baraimi® 3. In the light of this information there is good reason to/ R.T.Peel Esquire, MC*, The India Office, Lon den « mu. Pa. - a SEP 1930(§9&gt; 1^* «2- to expect that the party will arrive at Baraimi without undue difficulty. How much territory it will be able to see en route, particularly in the Hafit area, is another matter; and it would, I think, be well to draw attert ion to a few salient facts, 4, The most important tribes with permanent habitations in the Hafit-Baraimi area are the Na* im, the Al bu Shamis, and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi 1 a Dhuwahir. I should mention here that the Al bu Shamis are by origin a section of the Na’im, while those who are now generally known as the Na’im are actually the Al bu Khuraiban section of the tribe. The two are, however, quite separate from one another now and they are only too often on terms of hostility. Since the Na* im also have Dhank I will start this survey from there. (a) DHAHK* predominant power - the Ha f im, under Shaikh Kuhammad bin Sultan, brother of Shaikh Saqr mentioned above. Saqr and Muhammed are on bad terms and the former is said to be in constant fear of being killed by his brother. Watts does not know if Shaikh Mu hammed has been M sweetened” by the Sultan, but it is highly probable that this is the case. (b) HA]?IT# Holdings in three shares by (1) Al bu Shamis (2) Ha*im (3) shaikh of Abu DhaDi. I do not know the relative size of the holdings but I have heard an Al bu Shamis claim to the major portion of the area. (1) Al bu Shamis under Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahmah bin Salmin, cousin of shaikh Rashid bin Hamad, head Shaikh of the tribe (see below). I have met Shaikh Muhammad bin /bin Habmah, whose headquarters are at Sunain&amp;h village a^cut 30 miles south of Jebel Hafit proper. He corresponds with Ibn Saud and the Amir of Hasa, but undertook in conversation with me to render any assistance possible if I wished to visit his country. • (2) Na* im» Under Shaikh Ahmad as Saif who is related by marriage to Muhammad bin Rahmah of the Al bu Shamis. He and Shaikh Saqr of Baraimi are on bad terms , * 1 2 3 (3) Abu Dhabi . I have not very clear information regarding the Abu Dhabi representation here, but I understand it is probably through the Al bu Felah. (c) BARAIMI OASIS occupied by (1) Abu Dhabi (2) Na*im (3) Al bu Shamis. (1) Abu Dhabi holds by far the greater part through the Dhuwahir tribe with a total of over a thousand houses. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi himself, his uncle and others of Abu Dhabi, own falajs and gardens which th^ visit in the summer. It is note-worthy that even the Sultan of Muscat has now admitted to Watts that Abu Dhabi owns the principle villages of Jimi, Muraijib, Mas’udi and Hili in the Oasis. I am also fairly certain that the only areas suitable for a landing ground will be found in the Abu Dhabi share of the Oasis. (2) Ha* im . Under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan (the Muscat contact),owning Baraimi village proper and a village named Su’arah. Shaikh Saqr recently entered into alliances with Ajman (which will be useful to him) and Sharjah (which will not). It is reported that hitherto he has regarded the231- ( 252) -4- Shaikh of Abu Dhabi as his protector. (3) £L bu Shamis. Under Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad, who ry lives in a village named Hamasah. On excellent terms with Abu Dhabi. It is important to note that hostilities have recently broken out between Shaikh Saqr*s Na* im and the A1 bu shamis of Baraimi, three men being killed on either side* It is significant that the fighting started very soon after Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan returned from Muscat with money and i ammunition. * 5* You will see from the above that Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of Baraimi, on whom the Sultan is relying, is generally unpopular, and he has the reputation locally of being, to use the words of one report, n a first class twister”. It would perhaps be well for Petroleum Concessions Limited to know this. But the most important point to observe is that a Muscat party, relying on the aid of the Na’im Shaikh of Baraimi, may find themselves excluded from A1 bu Shamis territory and will certainly be unable to enter any area under Abu Dhabi control unless direct negotiations are opene with the Shaikh. So far as the Al bu Shamfcs are concerned the party may well expect to overcome difficulties when they arrive in the area by a judicious distribution of presents, and I can give them a letter for Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahmah. But unless Petroleum Concessions Limited are prepared to miss out all Abu Dhabi territory, and to do without a forward landing ground near Baraimi for their aerial reconnaissance, I am convinced that they must negotiate with the Shaikh. I admit the difficulties - the hostile attitude he has adopted so /so fs.r, and his probable dislike of a party arrivi ng in the Na f im village of Baraimi under Muscat auspices? but even so I believe there would be a fair chance of negotiations being successful© I might mention that one of the principle men in Abu Dhabi, Shaikh Ahmad bin Khalaf bin ’Utaibah, told the Residency Agaht a few days ago that he himself could very easily arrange with the Shaikh to take a party to Baraimi, and though this man is one of the biggest scoundrels on the Coast it is quite possible that Petroleum Concessions Limited may be able to use him to arrange for a landing groind and also for a visit to the Abu Dhabi part of the Baraimi-Hafit area. In view of the admission now made by the Sultan of Muscat (cf. paragraph 4 (c) (i) above), the Company need not fear the loss of the Sultan’s goodwill by so doing, and it seems that without Abu Dhabi co-operation neither the ground nor the air survey can be complete© 6© I am afraid I have been a long time coming to the particular matter on which you asked my opinion, namely, the arrangements to be made for the final journey of the combined party from Baraimi to the coast© I notice that Longrigg has made no suggestions on the rather important question how the motorised unit is to proceed from Sharjah to Baraimi, and takes up the matter from the time when the two parties meet at Baraimi and proceed to the coast, visiting interesting territory on the way (obviously including Jebel Faiyah). Presumably the route they would like to follow is roughly along the line between Baraimi and Dhaid (due east of Sharjah, property of Shaikh Khalid. Regent of Kalba) , with a detour to Jebel Faiyah itself. This I think could be arranged //''N 13^ Y- - 6 - arranged in toto , assuming we overcome the difficulty in regard to the Shaikh of Sharjah^ written permission for a visit to Faiyah. There is also a physical difficulty in that a possible motorable track from Baraimi past Jebel Faiyah is blocked by sand dunes abutting on Jebel Sumaini in the Beni Ka f ab area. This, however, is not insuperable since the strong man of the Beni Ka’ab, Shaikh Obaid bin Juma* , has twice verbally undertaken to clear the track through the dunes for Rs^lOO/-. (There will of course have to be other presents for the passage through Beni Ka’ab territory.) 7. Along this route the one important tribe is the Beni Kitab under Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Ali who, as you know, is at li n tl , loggerheads with the Shaikh of Sharjah. 3o strong are the Beni Kitab in the area north of Baraimi, that no party could move at all along this line without the aid and protection of this tribe, and having obtained their aid and protection it would be ridiculous to pass within sight of Jebel Faiyah and not visit it* Thus an immediate solution of the H written permission” problem is essential. It is possible that a solution will come in a few days, for it is reported that Shaikh Khalid of Kalba is expecting to meet Shaikh Muhammad bin • Ali at Kalba and M hopes to arrange a P.C.L. visit with him”. Rather more than two months ago there was a report that the Shaikh of Sharjah had handed over Rs.1500/- to Shaikh Khalid to fix things with the Beni Kitab, so it seems that Shaikh Khalid^ coming negotiations with Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Ali will be, ostensibly at any rate, on behalf of the Shaikh of Sharjah. If these are successful there need be no further difficulty about obtaining the requisite permission. If / w(15?) 23 ^. -7- If 'they fail solely on account of tlie bitter hostility between Sharjah and the Beni Kitab, I still believe that Shaikh Khalid can, acting directly on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Lim ited, quite easily make all arrangements necessary with the Beni Kitab; and I think he should be authorised todoso. It would then be necessary to take a firm line with the Shaikh of Sharjah jand to tell him that arrangements had been made for a party to visit Jebel Faiyah, that they would go there with or without his permission, and that he had better save his face (and such future prospects he may have) by signing his name® I see no other way of 'persuading” the Shaikh of Sharjah, and.'it is necessary now to recognise the inescapable fact that apart from purchasing Beni Kitab forbearance, as we understand he is trying to do through Shaikh Khalid, there is nothing whatsoever he can do to facilitate a visit to Jebel Faiyah either now or in the future® 8® Once matters have been fixed with the Beni Kitab through Shaikh Khalid, the rest is simple, but I hope you will 7\ impress on Longrigg that Beni Kitab co-operation is a sine qua non® I assume, incidentally, that the motorised unit from Sharjah would go out to Baraimi by the same route by which the combined party is to return. 9® In regard to 1h e question of a Pol it ical Of f icer accompanying the exploration party,|T' think we must exclude the possibility so far as the Muscat party is concerned, i® e. from Khaburah up to Baraimi. The Sultan would almost certainly raise objections and sny difficulties en route would be ascribed to the presence of the Political Officer On /23^ - 8 - On the other hand I think it is most desirable to send a Political Officer with the Shar j ah-3araimi party, Jas I have indicated above we are beginning to get into toich with the Na^m and Al bu Shamis of Baraimi and Hafit, and it is extremely desirable that this process should continue. It would also be a very great advantage to establish closer relations with the Beni Kitab, and a good deal of helpful information might be picked up during the journey., For Intelligence purposes I should also like to see a Political Officer included in the sir survey party, and I hope it will be possible to arrange this, I see no object in a Sharjah representative accompanying the motorised unit, nor, I think, need they take any one from Ajman, As things are no?/ likely to turn out the Shaikh of Ajman will not be in the picture (it was never intended to use him as more than a negotiator between Petroleum Concessions Limited snd the Beni Kitab), and his place will be taken by Shaikh Kh&amp;lid, who is a close personal friend of his. 10, I apologise for the length of this letter but I thought you should have a fairly full picture of current politics in the back areas (so far as we know them) for your further discusai ais with Petroleum Concessions Limited. 11.

We have received your letter PC27/82 of the 3rd June, 1958, in the first week of July 1938, when we were in Karachi. We returned to Muscat in the 2nd week of July 1938. Your above letter was delayed in the office of Messrs. Thomas &amp; Cook at Bombay, hence this reply comes to you so late. We thank you for your kind wishes. We are pleased to inform you that we shall be pleased to receive your geological exploration party in the middle of October, 1938, and send an escort with it to explore the places mentioned in your letter including Biraimi which belongs to Oman. The question of the landing ground at or near Biraim of Oman will be settled, and we will give our views on the matter after the geological party has visited Biraimi and its surroundings and chosen a ground for the landing of your aeroplanes. As regards the present landing ground from Salalah2-y^ - 2 - to Has A1 Had and which you desire to use, this question will be settled also in October 1958* I hope you will come to Muscat in the month of October 1938* to enable each of us to discuss the matter from his own point of view. Please inform us if your geologists wish to visit Dhofar. If they wish to explore that part we shall indicate to them the places for such exploration. We would suggest that the geological party should proceed from Muscat to Khaboura (on the Batinah coast by cars) and from there they should ride camels beginning with Wadi Hawasinah, and after visiting all that part of Dhahirah they should then proceed to Biraimi, Jabal Simani and Mahdah down to Sohar. These are the plans for your geological party and we do not think it will be necessary for you to visit Muscat before October 1938, as we hope your geologists will not encounter any difficulty in visiting the above places.

His Highness The Sultan of Muscat and Oman, The Palace, MUSCAT* Your Highness, I write to thank you very much for your letter which I have received today. According to our present arrangements, I myself expect to arrive at Muscat on October 18th, where the Political Agent has kindly suggested that I should be his guest. Our two geologists will arrive two weeks later and will hope to start on their exploration immediately. There will, I hope, be ample opportunities before their arrival to make the necessary arrangements. I shall, of course, ask permission to visit Your Highness as soon as I reach Muscat. As regards Dhofar, it is probable (but not certain) that the geologists will wish, slightly later in the season, to penetrate about 50 mile from the coast. This would be a rapid reconnaissance expedition in order to see the geological features of the area. with your authorisation, arrange this. It is probable that the party, after reaching Baraimi via Khabourah-Haw&amp;sinah-Dhank-Hafit, will wish to move from Baraimi northwards towards the coast, thus leaving Your Highness* territories Instead of returning PC.27/114 29th August, 1958 I am confident that your representative in Dhofar couldtp No. Holborn 3434.

In respect to item 4 - drawal of rupees when required from the Agency Treasury - I am approaching the Political Resident to obtain his concurrence and the necessary authority for this purpose. 3. I have been in touch with the Sultan regarding certain of the points raised in your letter end em now in a position to reply as follows:- Your sub-paragraph (a), Lr IrrxJL^u^jL rjr fa*-**^^ “! The Sultan states he proposes to make Mudhaffar his' chief Representative. As I mentioned to you I know this man and I feel confident he will be the right person for the purpose. The Sultsn at first seemed reluctant to agree to Hassan Mohammad Ja f afar accompanying the party in the capacity of Personal Assistant as he feared, he said, a man of that type might get mixed up in the somewhat delicate politics of the districts you intend to visit. I assured the Sultan that I understood from you that Hassah Mohammad’s role would be strictly confined to organising the party and acting as a general adviser and assistant to the members. His Highness then declared that under these circumstances he would have no objection to the presence of the individual in question. Your sub-paragraph (b) . ^ bivsy* fr* !v ;• The Sultan said that he had no guest house butthat there was an unfurnished house belonging to the State which couldaHHHB |be hired to the Company at a rental of Rs 70/- per mensem. My own accommodation at the Agency is of course limited but I should be glad to put up two members of the party until they are ready to start for the interior. Your sub-paragraph (c). k ^ ^^ The Sultan said that he would be quite agreeable. Your sub-paragraph (d) . ' ^ The Sultan informed me that he would be able to arrange for your geologists to visit the W ADI HAWASINA H, YANqUL and DHANK districts, HAIL, JABAL HAFIT, BARAIMI and the foothill regions north of that place towards the Trucial Coast. As regards the last named place, however, the Sultan said he could not of course commit himself to any definite distance. It would depend how far north of BARAIMI towards the Trucial Coast the foothill regions proposed to be visited, extended. As regards your flying wherever geological interests called the Sultan stated that he had no objection except so far as that he would be unable to guarantee security over certain areas in the event of forced landings. Concerning the use of the existing landing grounds in his territories the Sultan pointed out that these were all for the exclusive use of the Royal Air Force and that if your Company wished to use them he would want some sort of payment. Your sub-paragraph (e) . % &gt; The Suitah states that he is not in a position at present to have a landing ground prepared for you at BARAIMI. Accord ing to the Sultan the position there is that the district is divided up into a number of areas controlled by minor Shaikhs all of whom are on an equal position with one another. Until therefore the actual site of the landing ground is known work on it cannot be put in hand. When your geological party reach BARAIMI and choose their spot the Sultan stated to me that he anticipated no difficulty in having such a ground prepared.In the above connection you may be interested to hear that the Sultan declared that from what he had been recently told there was little likelihood of a suitable place for use as a landing ground being found near BARAIMI, on account of the rugged and broken nature of the country side. The nearest place where sufficiently level ground existed for the purpose was according to the Sultan some distance north of BARAIMI on the flat plain stretching to the Trucial Coast and outside his territories. The information at my disposal of this little known district is not enough to enable me to comment on the Sultan T s latter statement but I should be inclined to take it with a pinch of salt. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) R.P. WATTS.\(o Draft Paper political Department. 2 0 AUG 1938 Hugh Weightman, Esq., I.C.S., C/o Postmaster, Karachi. Dated 16th August / » 117 + V, !» / 17th ' / With reference to my d.o. telegram No.1466 of 17th August, I enclose copies of two letters from Longrigg about exploration. The Company are pushing ahead with their e^qploration plans on the assumption (which is confirmed in Watts* telegram No.106 of the 1st August) that the Sultan will be able to arrange for a Longrigg's letter of the 17th August, the should proceed in cars from Sharjah to Baraimi to meet their colleagues at the latter place during the last week in November. Thereafter it is proposed that the combined party should move auspices (i.e. the Trucial Sheikhs themselves to whom nominally, at any rate, all the territory in question belongs, or the local petty de facto In other words, having once reached Baraimi through the good offices of the Muscat side and as you will see from present idea is that a second party party to visit the Baraimi area from the northward towards the coast seeing, in Longrigg's own words, as much of the interesting territory as possible (this, of course, is meant to include such areas as Jebel Fayah) under whatever friendly to Rulers) may be available from day to day, 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 Sultan/V \ 1 Sultan of Muscat, the party are preparec. to undertake the journey to the coast with or v/ithout the co-operation of the Tracial Sheikhs and if the Company are ever to see the Trucial hinterland, this may well be the best way of attempting the job. There are, however, obvious difficulties in the way of giving the party a free hand to wander at will in this uncivilised area, not the least of which is the question of their safety, and we should accordingly be grateful if you would examine the Company’s proposals and let us have your considered views thereon as soon as possible. In your reply you will no doubt let us know how far you consider it is desirable, for a Political Officer to be associated v/ith the exploration party. A point which must not be overlooked is that the Company are expressly forbidden from entering Jebel Payah and Wadi-al-Hulu without the consent in writing of the Sheikh of Sharjah. So far the Sheikh has not been able to arrange for the Company’s geologists to visit Jebel Payah, and as you will see from his d.o. letter, No.441-S of the 21st July, Powle is of the opinion that if the Company are ever to enter the area probably the only way in which they will be able to do so is to invoke Article 10 of// Draft Paper. Department. of the Political Agreement and to turn to some other Sheikh. We are, however, still a litiriu doubtful v/hether present circumstances justify our going so far as advising the Company to invoke Article 10 (a step which they themselves are reluctant to take), and it may be that, if the Company’s present plans for approaching the area from the south and the objects of the visit are explained to the Sheikh, he be persuaded to ho It-C tr £» Ca.\jU^ •*- grant the necessary permission^and do whatever is in his power to facilitate the visit. In this connection you will note Longrigg’s suggestion that the motorised unit from Sharjah should be accompanied by a representative of the Sheikh of Sharjah and perhaps also of the Sheikh of Ajman, v/ho is apparently prepared to arrange for the geologists u to visit Fayah through his territory A*- v (vide Fowle’s Express Letter C/75 of the 16th February, 1938).

DHOFM) LIMITED HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON • E.C.2 17th August, 1938• My dear Symon, I write, at your suggestion, to confirm two points which emerged from our telephone conversa tion this morning. The first point is that we are handicapped by the absence of replies to the questions which I asked Mr. Watts in my letter of July 8 th (copy to you under my PC.27/91 that date). I was, this morning, on the point of cabling Watts kindly to expedite his replies, but you pointed out that this would be improper. Can you do anything for us in the matter? I had hoped that Watts would be able to reply, either directly or through official channels, very shortly after his return to Muscat. The second point raised by you concerns the movements of our land survey party on its trip northwards from Baraimi. It is at present proposed that a party, distinct from the Muscat-Khaburah- Baraimi party, will proceed in cars from Sharjah to Baraimi to meet their colleagues at the latter place during the last week in November. The object of this is to have motor transport available for the exploration of the country between Baraimi and the coast, with a consequent great saying of time. The meeting place of the two parties atBaraimi will no doubt be the residence of the Sultan’s representative there. It is, from the exploration point of view, a matter of evident indifference to us under whose auspices the parties travel between Baraimi and the coast, and we have visualised them as using whatever friendly contacts they might make en route. If you would like the party proceeding from Sharjah to Baraimi to be accompanied by a representative of the Shaikh of Sharjah, or even of Ajman, or by a representative of the Political, we should, of course, conform. Our one desire is to see as much of the interesting territory as possible under whatever friendly auspices may be available from day to day - a method which is usual and often inevitable in Arabian travel.

The aircraft which the Company proposes to use on the Trucial Coast and on Muscat territory, commencing about December 1st, will be a four- engined Scion Senior, recently purchased for the purpose. (This is the same aircraft that gave good service in our Hadhramaut survey last season). Our proposed flights will be notified to the Sultan*s Government, the P.A.

The civil flying regulations of Muscat territory will be observed, except in so far as departures from the letter of the law may be sanctioned in advance. As regards our exploration programme for those territories in general, you have had copies of my letter No. PC.27/82 dated June 5rd to H.H. the Sultan (copy forwarded to Mr. Symon under our PC. 27/85 of the same date), and of my PC.27/90 of July 8th addressed to Mr. Watts (copy of which was forwarded to Mr. Gibson under our PC. 27 / 9 I, also of July 8 th).

CaxA, Gould you please refer to your letter No.P.2 3549/38, dated the 16th June 1938, on the subject of Jabal Shaikh, who has been given ample time to get the Company into Jabal Faiyah, has failed to do so. The fact that can be deduced from this is that he i s unable to get the Company into that area. If the latter are in fact to enter Jabal Faiyah, then the only way, though this is not an absolute certainty, is to invoke ArticOLe^lO as I have I suggested, and to turn to some other Shaikh. If we are not to pursue this course of action, as far as I can see the Company must remain out of Jabal Faiyah. I Faiyah 2 My opinion is as expressed previously.

We have obtained the views of the geologists and the Political Agent, which can be summarised as under!- At the time of writing the position would appear to be that the Political Agent is optimistic that arrangements will be made for the visit to Jabal Faiyat by some means or other but whether a visit to Baraimi with subsequent explo ration of Jabal Hafit will materialise in the coming sea son is by no means certain. The methods of reaching Barai mi under consideration also might entail different plans altogether from those at present under examination. 2* Assuming however that one or both places will be visited from a Trucial Coast base provisional plans are given in para 3. 3. Provisional plans for visits to Manamah. Jabal Fa ivah and Jabal Harit - Season 1938-1939- BASEx- (a) A suitable base would be either Dubai or Sharjah dependent upon the circumstances and relations with the Hulers etc. at the time the party were prepared to move. There are circumstances which make it inexpedient to attempt to fix definitely one or other of these two places at present. (b) ROUTES : We quote Mr. Williamsons note below verbatim! 'Hout^sn- a. &lt;■ ebel . aiyah . This is easy of access from Dubai, Sharjah or Ajman by a route which passes south of Ajman. This is sandy and rough in parts, but offers no great ob_stacles to light vehicles. From Has al Khaimah it is fairly easy to followthe plain which lies just west of the Oman Range, southwards to Jebel Faiyah. W e have already/-already been within easy reach of the mountain at Dhaid, where we also had the advantage of an excel lent supply of water. Jebel Hafit . I believe it should not be too difficult to reach the Baraimi Oasis and Jebel Hafit from Jebel Faiyah, by driving south along the western foot of the Oman mountains, I understand that there is one bad patch of heavy s and which might be trouble some, but it might be possible to avoid the worst of it. By following this line we should be able to study an area in which we are very intesested, ©s we have „ already seen from a distance evidences of structu 'es I ther^. I should certainly strongly recommend this in preference to makin j the big detour from Abu Dhabi, over geologically uninteresting ground. c. South of Jebel Hafit . 3bcfraxgxfeRyKxAxfck±g x 8 MKjt 2 i±x$:x I have no knowledge of the country beyond this mountain, but have been informed that there are extensive areas of plain, devoid srioi sand by means of which it might be possible to penetrate southwards. This area would best be approached along the east side of Jebel Hafit. (c) PERSONNEL ? The undermentioned numbers include the views of the Geologists and the Political Agent Political Agent 1 P.A’s Interpreter 1 P.A*s Servant 1 Geologists 2 Driv era 2 (x) Geologists* Interpreter 1 Cook and Camp helps 4 Shaikh*s friends and guards 12(y) “24Tz) (x) The geologists would drive vehicles. Native drivers should also be qualified mechanics. (y) Mr. Williamson considers this 12 may exuand to 20. (z) Possibly 30. (d) TRANSPORT ? 1. Mr. Williamson has recommended new Ford transport fitted with 900 x 13 tyres. He recommends 2 station wagons 2 panel vans but considers the 'guards” question may necessi tate a fifth vehicle. He will no doubt discuss this in London on his arrival in early June. iiAII. We would draw attention td the fact that the nature of the programme (referred to in later paragraphs) would not appear to necessitate complete nobil ity of the whole party. It would seem that‘camps at Faiyah and li ter Baraimi etc. could be established and heavy equipment trans ported in advance in batches, and returned in the same way. (e) TENTAGE. RATION. WATER &lt;Sc MISCELLANEOUS ADMINI3T lA - TIVE A RRAN 3SMKNTS . These will be arranged by P.C.L. and presumably the geologists will go into this in detail. (f) SECURITY ARRANWJNTS . The contacts with the Shaikhs and tribal leaders will be arranged by the Political Department, P.C.L. will arrange for payments to Shaikhs* ,, friends ,, t guides and guards. This will be done in consultation with the Political but actual payments will be made by the geolo ists. (g) PROGRAMME &amp; ITINERARY &gt; The P.A. suggests that the visits be split into two parts , preferably of about 7 days each with seven to ten days interval between. During this interval the geologists will be at their coastal base and the P.A. will be free to complete with his routine work either f rom the Trucial Coast or, if necessary, flying back to Bahrain. The P.A. is against any programme or plans which involve the splitting of the party. It would seem that some time in November is suitable. (NOTE*- P.C.L. in letter No. PC.28/608 dated 23rd May, indicate that the date for the Faiys visit must be dependent upon the success of schemes being gone into for exploration of the north and north-west of Muscat, Hafit and Baraimi)• Any communications found necessary will have to be organised at the time and as circums tances direct. (h) DATE OF MOVmGNT (i) COMMUNICATIONS * Regular communications are not envisaged as parties are supposed to be completely tm equipped for the visits. Sgd. E. V.

My d«&amp;r Watts, I writs primarily to thank you for giving us so much of your time and at tantion on Wsdnesday night, and secondly to recapitulate (as ws arranged that I should) the points on ehich we require either confirmation or the views of (or action by) the Sultan.

Xou gave us a quantity of relevant info mat ion and dealt with various queries upon which X need not now enlarge* Matters upon which your views were of particular interest to us werei- (1) that as far as you were concerned, it would probably not be necessary to open a regular office or instal a European official in Mus cat for the purposes of the proposed recon naissance, and we could be satisfied with, and obtain all necessary service from, the local representative of the k.I.O.C*, or of Gray Mackenzie, or perhaps a leading mer chant such as Haji Baqir.

We could then convert to dollars as and when necessary. (5) that you thought that fiaid work In Oman could reasonably commence at the end of October. This would involve our advance representative arriving at Muscat eariiar in the month, and the geologists arriving and forming their party e week or two later. Passing now to mattars upon which we seem to require your help in eliciting views or ection from the Sulten, could you kindly sey (a) whom the Sulten proposes as his Chief Represent ative to accompany the party. fill it be, as you suggested, Mudhaffer? fill he object to the presence of our Aden friend, whose role could be that of Personal Assistant or Clerk? (b) can we expect any accommodation to be provided by the Sultan for our geological party during its faw days in Muscat, a.g, in his guest-house?PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (OMAN AND DHOFAR) LIMITED. - 5 - (c) will th« Sultan consent to our dispensing with a European representative for the tine being, and be willing to accept, as our tea- porary representative, one of the persons indicated above - provided that I or some other nanegerlal spokesman of the Company visits hla at the outset? (d) whether the Sultan*s enquiries after his return hone lead him to confirm that he can obtain access for us to the territories which he indicated to me In London, parti cularly the Wadi Hawaslnah, Xanqul and Dhank districts, Hall, Jabal Hafit, Barela! and the foothill regions north of that towards ^ the frucial Coast? What is actually required from hla is, of course, such intro ductions as will secure us free access and a welcome In these districts. May we assume also that he will have no objection to our flying wherever geological Interest calls, and using all landing-grounds in his dominions? (a) Is the Sultan in a position to prepare for us a landing-ground at or near Baraimi, and can he actually proceed with this? Alter natively, can he arrange that the work of levelling, marking„ etc. can be put in hand by our geological party when It reaches Baralmi by land during Movember? I realise that it is likely to give you a good deal of trouble to keep pressing the Sultan on thasa matters, and regret this; but you kindly undertook to do it and I fear that we can hardly expect results otherwise.

Throughout last winter the Company negotiators were in active touch with the remaining Shaikhs but failed to reach agreement and, on the advice of the Political Resident, the Company have withdrawn their negotiators for the present. The Political Resident has been requested to furnish/\&gt; 2 . i\irnish his views as to what line of policy should ■be followed if^afte^r negotiations are resumed^the Company again fail, through no fault of their own, ■sy* to obtain concessions from the remaining Shaikhs. On the ”Exploration” side progress has also been slow. Sir Trenchard Eowle’s idea that the proposed aerial reconnaissance of the hinterland should be carried out by R.A.F. machines has had to be dropped on the ground of expense and, with the approval of all concerned, the Compemy have since been informed that H.M.G. see no objection to the use of civil aircraft for this purpose. An aerial reconnaissance cannot however be undertaken until arrangements have been made for a suitable ”interior” landing ground — see (C) below. The main areas which the Company wish to explore * ' 1 09 are: - (A) Manama , which is in territory claimed by the Shaikh of Ajman who has stated that he can arrange a visit for the Company’s geologist at any time without difficulty. The Company, however, do not think a visit to Manama alone is worth while, and wish to combine it with a visit to (B) Jebel Faiyah which is in territory claimed by the Shaikh of Sharjah. That Shaikh has, however, been unable to get a geological party into the area and the Political Resident has put forward a proposal, which is still under consideration, that an attempt should be made to get in through the good offices of some other Shaikh.

(1) The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (who could, if he would) has categorically refused to give assistance for a party to visit Baraimi in connection with the proposed landing ground. \ouX. (2) The^Shaikhs of Jebel Hafit have politely refused a written invitation from the Political Resident suggesting that they should go Sharjah for a discussion with the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, and the representatives of the Company. The Political Resident considers that this refusal indicates existence of fairly strong local opposition in Jebel Hafit. Prom the Company’s point of view the present position in regard to exploration is very unsatisfacto^ and as they have failed, through no fault of their ownjto get into the interior from the Trucial coast they now propose to try and get in from Muscat. The Political Resident favours this proposal and, with his approval, conversations between the Sultan and the Company took place during the former’s recent visit to London.

Your Highness, I venture to write, firstly to express the hope that you have enjoyed the remaining part of your travels and are concluding them in good health: and secondly to refer again to the subject which we dis cussed at the last interview which you kindly accorded me at the Dorchester Hotel, London - that is, the proposed geological exploration party which my Company would wish to send to your country in the autumn of the present year. As 1 explained to Your Highness, the regions of your country in which our geologists are most interested (from the point of view of the possibility of discovering oil) are those to the west and south west of the main Hajar rang# of mountains. As a large part of this region is not, we understand, at present available for exploration, the present proposals are limited to the area north of the twenty- third parallel, that ia, the districts of the Wadi Bawaslnah, Yanqul, Dhank, and to the north of these / places up to the limits of your Sultanate, including Jabal Haflt, Baralml, etc. Your Highness will appreciate that within this araa (and to the south and south-west of it, if possible) our representatives would wish to be able to make their reconnaissance as widely and as freely as posslbla.PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (OMAN AND DHOFAR) LIMITED. - 2 - It is proposed, also^ to make use of a four-engined aeroplane, which would permit aerial reconnaissances both of the same area and of areas in the south of Your Highness* territories, where a line of aerodromes exists along the coast from Salalah to Has al Hadd Inclusive, and from the latter place along the coast to the north* In this connection, and with special reference to air exploration of the inland districts, we are most anxious to be able to land at or near Baraimi, and Your Highness Informed me verbally that you hoped to be able to help us in this by directing the levelling of a landing-ground there. We consider this matter to be of great Importance* In connection with Baraimi landing-ground, and in general with help which we may secure from the Shaikhs and headmen of the interior, the Company will, of course, be ready to show its appreciation by suitable presents to the persons concerned* It has been understood that Your Highness is returning to Muscat towards the end of the present month* In that event I venture to hope that it may be possible for you to find time to consider the questions and problems which may arise from our programme as suggested above. If our expedition is to operate during the forthcoming autumn and winter, we are com pelled to make arrangements some months ahead, and these can be made only upon the basis of fairly definite decisions regarding the movements of the party. Does Your Highness consider that it would be of assistance in reaching these decisions if I visited you at Muscat during July (after the return of Major Watts)? If you feel that this would be desirable (as you Indicated, I think, during our conversation in London) I will arrange it. I have the honour to be, Your Highness* obedient servant, (Sgd.) S. H.

Flag A - Lower file (of 17th September, 1937) between the Sheikh of Sharjah and Petroleum Concessions Limited is that ( ”Until the Sheikh permits the Company in writing Clause C of at back of Concession Agreement. Scheduled No.I ’’the Company may not enter for the present nor ’’undertake any work in the two areas named ” A1--Fayah and Wadi Al-Hulu”. The Sheikh of Sharjah has been unable to arrange for the visit of the Company's geologists to visit Al- Fayah and for the reasons given in his letter of 16th proposal is strictly correct since the Political Agreement was never intended to override specific undertakings by the Company to the Sheikh and it is questionable whether it can be held to do so in the present case. May we have your views on the point please? It seems to be clear from the special provision relating to the Al-Fayah area, in Schedule 1 Clause C of the Commercial Agreement, that some reason must have | existed for this special treatment. It may be that the Flag X - this file.

Since, however, the provision is only intended to he 'for the present 1 ' it seems reasonable to suggest that the Sheikh v/as under an obligation to take such steps as were reasonably possible to make the area available, and to remove the obstacles (whatever they were) in the way of allowing the Company to work that particular area. Under Clause 10 of the Political Agreement prior permission of the Sheikh is necessary for working any area, only in the case of Al-Payah it has to be in writing. Clause 10 might be brought into operation in both cases, but since Al-Payah has been specially dealt with by the Clause in the Schedule to the Commercial Agreement, there must, in all likelihood, be special circumstances attaching to that area which, in assenting to that Clause, the Company has recognised no less than the Sheikh. The question of whether it is reasonable to withhold permission, under any clause of this character, is a question of fact which must depend on all the surrounding circumstances. (Sd.) H.

Heference paragraph 4 of the itecord of the Informal Meeting held at the India office on the 12th -April l93\^(copy forwarded under India Office letter No.P.Z. 2909/38, dated 29th April 1938), on the subject of Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration on the True! slI Coast. 2. I have now discussed the matter with Yifelgfrtman and my views are as follows. As you are aware, our efforts to get the Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration parties into the irucial Coast hinterland good time.into this area, and the Company v/ere unwilling to adopt 1938• .nevertheless I think we must now face the fact that it is definitely impossible for the shaikh of Sharjah to get the Company into *Tabal Js’aiyah, and if the latter wish to explore that area they will have to concur in my proposal referred to above. if the company concur, then they could write a letter to the Shaikh that as he has been unable to arrange for a visit to J&amp;bal JJ'aiyah they are applying to the Political Hesident under Article 10 of the Political Agreement. 1 would then inform the Shaikh that /ac-'il expired (vide paragraph 2 of my Express Letter ho.C/75, dated 16th February 1938). Ihat it is therefore open to area in question. I am therefore instructing Weightman. Concessions Limited Local Hepresentative at Bahrain to the above effect. (2) A point of some importance is that in any communication to the Bhaikh there would be no mention of the question of the actual ownership of Jabal Faiyah, since notwithstanding the fact that thftjr eventually explored this area through some other agency than that of the Shaikh, it might suit the Company later to develop it (should oil be found there) under the Sharjah concession. It is impossible to foretell how things will turn out on the Truclal Coast, and both the Company and ourselves should try and keep our hands as free as possible. a proposal i made for using the Shaikh of .ajman for this V purpose, vide my express Letter no.o/i42, dated 4th March the period covered by the words 'for the present 11 has the Company to make their own arrangements to visit the unless he sees objection, to approach the Petroleum (3) fhe Company, in consultation with me, could then approach/JO approach the Shaikh of ^jman as previously proposed, or Shaikh Khalid (the Kalba Regent} or the Shaikh of the heni Kitab, the tribe who inhabit Jabal -b’aiyah. C» Baraimi » Jabal Mafit * (1) Baraimi is a key position, both as an emergency landing ground in connection with the viompacy^s air exploaation and as a base for the ground exploration of Jabal Hafit* The situation here is that the Shaikhs of Jabal Hafit were written to, suggesting that they should come and have a discussion with the Assistant lolitical Agent, Bahrain, and representatives of the Company at Sharjah, but sent a polite refusal* This refusal to discuss was most unusual as, whatever may be the result of a discussion, an Arab Shaikh is generally only too willing to talk* This refusal indicates the existance of fairly strong local opposition in Jabal Hafit* (2) The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, when approached by me with reference to giving assistance for a party to visit Baraimi in connection with the proposed landing ground there, was entirely obdurate, vide paragraph 3 of my Express Up'zh-. Letter Ho*C/137, dated 3rd March 1938* (3) The Company had originally intended to carry out their aerial exploration through the Royal Air Force, but later, on the ground of expense, proposed using private aircraft* What ie required now is (a) a definite statement in writing from the 9 Company that they can provide the private aircraft A which, in my opinion, should be four-engined to I lessenthe risk of forced landings. (b) that even with four-engined aircraft they require the landing ground at Baraimi. (c)(c) that Hie Majesty's Government concur in the aerial exploration. iJ'or my part 1 see no objection. Assuming that the answers to Va), (b) and ^c) above are in the affirmative we have to consider how to approach the Baraimi - Jabal Hafit problem with a view to operations commencing next autumn. (5) It will be seen from paragraph 4 of Kecord referred to above that the Petroleum Concessions Limited, as represented by Mr. Longrigg, now favour an approach to Baraimi and Jabal Hafit through the Sultan of Muscat, and suggest co-operation by His Majesty's Government Y/ith the Sultan to that end. 1 think that this suggestion should be adopted. We have failed through no fault of our own to get the Company in from the frucial Coast side, and if we negative the Company's present proposal, and again try, and fail, from the Trucial Coast side, the Company might have a legitimate grievance. **.t any rate I think we should countenance the Company's proposal to the extent of agreeing to their again approaching the Sultan and trying to get something in the nature of a definite promise from him that he can get them into Baraimi • P’or this purpose they should send a representative to meet the Sultan in Bombay, where he arrives at the beginning of June, and where I understand he will stay some three weeks. &lt;tfhen we learn to what extent the Sultan will bind himself in regard to access to Baraimi we can made up our minds whether to leave it to him to get the Company into that area, or to renew our efforts from the Trucial Coast. (6) As in the case of Jabal T'aiyah ^paragraph 3.B (2) above) we need not commit ourselves to the Sultan in regard to the ownership of Baraimi. On the other hand, since the Sultaiy'Sultan actually claims Baraimi, if he succeeds in getting the Company into that place, hie rights to it will be much strengthened. * I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, Weightman and Watts. 1 T'C XtiJU.v*\ &gt; t — COPY OR 6tr GCH/DIAo 3D 3.(o 1 (61 groups) r\z, | . 3S36 \_ 1958 2198&lt; DSC YPHE.R OF TELEGRA Prom Lieutenant-Colonel Sir ToC.

They would hope to see as much of the slopes and foothills west of the main range (this being the territory of greater geologi cal interest) as cen be made accessible by the Sultan and/or the Trucial chiefs. i The importance of having adequate contacts, and particularly a landing-ground, at Baraimi, is very apparent, since this would permit aerial exploration of a much greater area as well as serving as a base for the party on land. It seems 30IJJO VJGNI 8261AVW2 - 'Hid «W2lat present that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi could, if he would, provide us with what we want at Baraimi; while the Sultan would, if he could. tf Your reference to a possible visit by Sir Trenchard Fowle to Muscat suggests that it might be advantageous if a representative of the Company (probably myself) visited it on the same occasion, in order that plans as definite as possible for the expedition might be agreed by all parties, and at the same time the Company could make some necessary arrangements and enquiries pn the spot, preparatory to the Geologists 1 arrival.

Skliros PC.27.28/64. CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON • E.C.2 19th April, 1938* Dear Mr. Peel, M 0 2 ^ 9^ 31- The question was raised by this Company in March 1937 as to whether aerial survey, carried out by a civilian firm for the exploration of the Trucial Coast hinterland and/or of the Sultanate of Oman, would be permitted. The India Office reply is contained in letter No. P.Z. 2926/37 dated May 18th, I 937 . This reply was, on the whole, discouraging: and since that date the subject of aerial exploration has been pursued upon different lines - those of obtaining the co-operation of the R.A.F. for the work. The latter showed every willingness to co-operate; but the distance of the territory concerned from their base in Iraq, the unexpectedly heavy expense which would fall upon the Company, and the limitations of action necessarily imposed upon service machines, have made it impossible so far to proceed beyond the stage of discussion. It might therefore be reasonable to re-consider the use of civilian aircraft, in the event of the Board of this Company deciding to press on with the explora tion of these difficult territories, as far as this is practicable. The three generaJL conditions laid down in the first paragraph of the India Office letter under v . _ reference can be fulfilled. As, however, the Trucial HCAn ; V' x ; PSi. * ■. | 2 C APR 1938 INDIA OFFICE! • • 4Shaikhs 1 control in areas which they claim is more than doubtful; and as the territory chiefly of interest lies beyond such control, and chiefly beyond such claims: and as our options with three out of the five Shaikhs concerned have expired and have not been renewed: it might be thought more practicable to omit reference to the Shaikhs altogether in the matter. (This would not, of course, apply to the Sultan of Muscat). As regards the type of machine, etc. which would be used, you may be certain that we should act under the best advice, and in no ignorance of the nature of the territory. Before committing ourselves we should certainly seek your views and those of the Political Resident. The purpose of this letter is to verify from you - for the possible information of the Board, if they prove interested - that the objection which you felt to the use of civilian aircraft for exploration in these terri tories may be considered as no longer in force, provided that we act under the general guidance of the Political Resident, obtain permission as necessary from the Sultan of Muscat, and comply with civil aircraft regulations, if any, in the controlled portions of the territories of Dubai and Sharjah, where we hold concessions. You will appreciate that, if it is decided to pursue geological exploration during the next cold weather, a decision as to the use of aircraft will doubt less be necessary and your views on the matters here raised are essential to this. Yours sincerely. R.T. Peel Esq., M.C., India Office Whitehall,COPY OF ?.Z. 2727/38. A S Eecord of an Infomal Meeting held at the India Office on the 12th April, to discuss the activities of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. PRESENT : Mr.R.T. Peel (in the Chair) Sir T.Eowle) Mr.Gibson ) India Office. ) Mr.Svmon ) Mr.Lewisohn)Representing )Petr oleurn Mr.Longrigg)Cone ess ions )Limited . Mr.Longrigg opened the discussion by saying that there were three matters which he wished to raise, viz:- A. The position in regard to the Koweit Neutral Zone; B. The position in regard to the Bahrein Unallotted Area; C. The position on the Trucial Coast, etc. 2. With regard to A (the Koweit Neutral Zone), Mr.Longrigg said that as a result of our refusal to allow Major Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, Major Holmes had severed his connection with Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and the Company were afraid that he might now resume his connection with the California Company. Major Holmes was now at Koweit to consult with the Sheikh regarding the Neutral Zone and owing to his influence with the Sheikh they were apprehensive lest he might persuade the Sheikh to give the concession to American interests before Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a further opportunity of putting forward their proposals. Mr.Longrigg then went on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government might see their way to discourage American interests, or at least to ensure that tne Sheikh did not cede his oil rights in the Neutral Zone until Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a fair opportunity/opportunity of competing. He v/as promised that the Company’s views would receive consideration. 3. With regard to B (the Bahrein Unallotted Area), Mr.Longrigg referred to his previous call on the 31st March, at which he had left a copy of the Company's draft lease relating to parts of the Bahrein Unallotted Area and he said that here again the Company were concerned about the future intentions of Major Holmes, who was fully informed as to their proposals. The Company were satisfied that there was little chance of the Sheikh of Bahrein giving them the whole of the Unallotted Area and that they had been led to believe that the Sheikh intended to give everything except the Hawar Group of islands to the Americans. Bor this reason they had departed from their original intention to compete for the whole of the Unallotted Area; but while they were prepared to leave the main island out of their plans, they wanted rather more than the Hawar Group and he hoped that His Majesty’s Government would feel able to support the Company on the basis of the draft concession. Sir Trenchard Bowie intervened at this stage to point out that the Company's proposed concession area included certain islands (i.e. the Hawar Group and Basht Dibal) whose ownership as between Bahrein and Q,atar had not yet been clearly determined. While on the evidence at present available to His Majesty's Government these islands belonged to Bahrein there was reason to suppose that the Sheikh of Qatar might wish to advance claims to them and he thought that it might be preferable to ask the Sheikh of Bahrein to postpone the resumption of negotiations for a short period (say two or three months) in order that the question of ownership could be finally determined. This suggestion/J' 3rs) k This seems to be the case - In the Qatar c one es s i on (Article 2 ) the State of Qatar is defined as 'the whole of the area over which the Sheikh rules and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attached t o the Agreement. ' A.C.B.S. 19.4.38. 3. suggestion had been put to Lord Cadman in a recent conversation and it was understood that His Lordship was agreeable. Mr»Longrigg said, however, that the Company were opposed to any postponement and he personally thought it would be a pity to put ideas of ownership into the mind of the Sheikh of Qatar. He pointed out, moreover, tha.t if enquiries showed that the islands in question belonged to x the Sheikh of Qatar, they would be included in the concession which the Company had already obtained from that Ruler; and he said that by entering into negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein for them, the Company were merely running the risk of paying twice for the same thing. The Company were prepared to take this chance and would definitely prefer to carry on with the negotiations without any postponement. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that he had not appreciated tne latter point and that in the circumstances he was inclined to withdraw his suggestion for postponing the negotiations. Mr. Peel wound up thi s par t of the d iscussion by s aying that the views put fo rward on,behalf PiL^ACo mpa,ny w ould be carefully considered an d that a decision would be gi ven as_ soon as_posaible. 4. With regard to C (the Trucial Coast, etc.), Mr.Longrigg said that there were two separate points, viz: (1) Concessions; ( 2 ) Exploration. (pty With regard to (l) (Concessions), the present position was that the Company had obtained concessions in respect of Lebai and Sharjah; but so far all efforts to induce the remaining Sheikhs to come into line had proved unavailing. As far as was reasonably possible, the Company had met the various demands put forward by the Sheikhs and he thought that fully adequate terms had been offered; but the Sheikhsseemed to be completely out of hand and appealed to be convinced that eventually they could get whatever terms they liked to ask. A state of deadlock had been reached and the Company felt that unless His Majesty's Government were prepared to intervene, the only alternative open to them was to temporarily withdraw their negotiate S • Jn. sked for his views, Sir Trenchard Powle said he thought that if the Sheikhs v/ere left alone, for say six months, they would probably come round and accept the Company's offers. Mr. Longrigg said, hov/ever, that in oil matters waiting usually resulted in bigger demands and he thought that delay in coming to terms might make it more difficult for the Sheikhs to withdraw from their present position. If, however, the Political Resident advised v/aiting, the Company would of course accept his advice, but they hoped that it would be found possible to do something to hasten matters. Mr. Lewisohn then asked if the Company could regar d their presen t privileged position as watertight and was in formed that for t he present, at any rate , they had no need to v/orry on this score . Mr. Lev/isohn then went on to say that he thought that the Political agreement might have something to do with the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah's refusal to come to terms and he asked whether His Majesty's Government regarded it as essential to obtain the Sheikh's agreement. Mr. Longrigg agreed with his colleague and suggested that the terms of the agreement were sufficiently binding on the Company without bringing in the Sheikhs. Mr. Peel pointed out, hov/ever, that as tw o of the Sheikhs , namely Debai and Sharjah, had rec opyi ised the agr e ements: it might b e difficu lt not to follow t h e same proced ure i n the ca_se o f the others, but he p rom ised t hat the questi on would b ere-ex amino d. Or) As regards exploration the Company’s point of view, , Mr. Longrigg said that the present situation wa from completely/completely unsatisfactory. He said that although much of the territory concerned could probably be written off as valueless ? some parts appeared to have definite interest and they must see it all. Up to the present the Company's efforts to visit certain ,f interesting” areas through the medium of the Trucial Sheikhs, had been unsuccessful and the Company had formed the conclusion that it would probably be best to leave the Trucial Sheikhs alone for the time being and to try and operate through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg mentioned in this connection that he had seen the Sultan during the latter’s recent visit to London and had been told that in addition to certain parts of Muscat territory, the Sultan might be able to arrange for a party to reach Baraimi (which the Sultan claimed belonged to him) through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg said that this suggestion ^emed to offer greater promise of getting something done and he enquired whether it might not be possible for His Majesty’s G-overnment to co-operate with the Sultan. H e was promis ed that the point would be considered . 5. Sir Trenchard Pov/le mentioned that during his recent conversation with Lord Cadrnan he had been asked to suggest the name of a suitable person to act for Petroleum Concessions Limited in connection with the forthcoming negotiations at Bahrein and Koweit, Sir T. Pov/le said that normally he would hesitate to give advice, but as the present circumstances were somewhat peculiar he was prepared to do so. The names which occurred to him were Messrs.Longrigg, Lermitte and Packer and he said that so far as the local Political authorities were concerned, all these gentlemen v/ould be acceptable. He also thought that they would be acceptable to the Rulers concerned. INDIA OFFICE. 12th April 1938. ii. C . B .

(iv) At present the Htuler is so unreasonable that he has not stated any points in the standard draft to which he objects. (b) Has al Khaimah . (i) Lemitte has been asked to c onfira that another half lakh will clinch matters. (ii) If he confirms this it may be paid on conditions: 2. EXPLORATION . (a) Land - Lanamah and Jabal Faivah . (i) P.C.L. hesitate to antagonize the Ruler by taking ac tion to get to Jabal Faiyah independent of his good offices and consider that it might be argued that 5 or 6 months was too short a time after signature. (ii) The visit to Jabal Faiyah alone even if arranged would not justify the geologists visit. * land expedition with all the preparations necessary could be' better jus tified if more than one area has been opened. (iii) Chief advantage of early exploration of Faiyah is the information to be gained on Has al Khaimah prospects. (iv) Summing up - it would suit P.CiL. better tov^it until next season in the hope that more territory will be open perhaps including the N.W. parts of the Sultan of Oman’s dominions. (b) Air Surveys^ (i) A Braimi Landing Ground appears highly desirable whe ther exploration if any is ultimately carried out by R.A.F. or civilian aircraft.

Moreover a visit to Jebel Faiyah alone would not jus tify the geologists’ expedition. Such an expedition with all the preparations necessary would be better justified if more than one area were open.

The Shaikh of Sharjah has been unable to arrange f or the visit of Petroleum Concessions Limited* s geologists to Jebel Fai- yah. In paragraph C of the Schedule to Petroleum Concessions Li mited's Sharjah Concession it is laid down that the Company can not visit Faiyah without the written permission of the Shaikh. In this proviso, however, there occur the words 'for the present'^ ana as the bnaikh has been given some five months to arrange for The visit without result I think that it may reasonably be assumed that this period is longer than is covered by these words. 3. In these circumstances the Company may like to invoke Arti cle 10 of the Political Agreement of the 12th November 1937 bet ween His Majesty's Government and the Company. I could then per haps make other arrangements to facilitate the visit of the Com- .pony's geologists to Faiyah, possibly through the Shaikh of {signature) j Ajman/-- 2 - /r* Ajman v;ho has informed the Political Agent, 'Bahrain, infor- mally that he can do so • 4.

In the above connection please see my express letter C/71 of 16th February 1938. It is true that as explained the Shaikh of Sharjah has not sent the correct letter, but in viev; of his promise to Captain Hickinbotham I am of opi nion that we can assume that he has for all intents and pur poses taken cognisance of the Political Agreement. 6.

As regards a definite undertaking that if the landing-ground is made we will pursue the survey, I have told Mr. Packer to assure the Political Agent that in that event we shall definitely pursue the survey, provided that nothing unforeseen has occurred to stop it, and provided that we can satis factorily arrange the terms and conditions with the R.A.F. - or, just possibly, carry it out by civilian fPECa.

My dear Russell, At the conclusion of our conversation of yester day afternoon regarding the probable cost to P.C.L. of the proposed Trucial Coast Aerial Survey, you very kindly undertook firstly to ask A.O.C. Baghdad for his ideas as to the number of flying hours required to carry out scheme B in its various stages, and secondly to let me have, in writing, ideas as precise as possible regarding the sums which we should be asked to pay on account of the R.A.F. services. ir We have re-discussed the proposed survey this morning in the light of such cost figures as I was given yesterday - for instance, the £25 per plane per flying hour and the additional payments in respect of personnel, various insurances, etc. It appears that the cost to us of the survey is likely to be greater than we had anticipated and we feel that it would be Justified only if it could be expected to throw up new information of real value. 3 Now, as you are aware, the A.O.C. (besides insisting upon aircraft working in pairs) does not wish to push the survey further south from Sharjah than Jab el Hafit until the construction of a usable landing ground at Baraimi. This, therefore, limits the survey, until that time, to areas of which our geologists saw by far the greater part last year: and, at the same time, we are encouraged by the Political Resident to hope for permission to visit the most interesting points in that area by land during the present season. He is in fact trying actively to facilitate this for us. 21st December, 1957*I? C A I 1 ;36. PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL COAST) LIMITED. - 2 - U These appear to be arguments for not proceeding with the survey until the Baraimi landing ground is in existence after which (it was understood from the A.O.C.) a zone of a further 100 miles to the south and southeast could be flown over. S It would certainly seem uneconomic when each flying hour is to cost so considerable a figure, to bring aircraft from Iraq for Stage 1 only and later bring them back for Stage 2. A further advantage in postponing a decision until after the Baraimi landing ground has come into existence is that a more detailed assessment could be made of the probable cost of the enterprise, and our own requirements perhaps modified. We should, however, be still grateful for the information which you kindly undertook to obtain and let us have as materials for such a decision. In particular, if you are making estimates for flying hours, could these be separated under (a) hours spent in getting aircraft to and from Sharjah, (b) hours spent in the Yas-Abu Dhabi-Sharjah area (shown in red on map B), (c) hours spent in stage No.l of the eastern part of the area (lines in green on map B as far south as Hafit). I hope this will not give you additional trouble. This letter in general confirms results of our telephone conversation of this afternoon. I am most grateful for your helpful attitude.

We note that it is proposed to send ground parties, including a Political Officer, to Jebel Hafit and to other inland areas in which Petroleum Concessions Limited are interested. We are glad of this, because, when we first received the copy of Hickinbotham's despatch, which formed the enclosure to India Office letter 7019/37 of 29th October we did - although we could not agree with all he wrote in regard to King Ibn Saud - most heartily agree with his suggestion that the first thing His Majesty's Government should do in regard to the frontier question in this area was to secure more exact knowledge as to the extent inland of the influence of the Trucial Sheikhs (and of the Sultan of3. We are not entirely clear to whom the Sheikhs mentioned in paragraph 4 of the Political Resident’s letter of 10th December as having influence in the Jebel Hafit (and presumably in the adjoining Baraimi oasis, v/hich seems to be the key-point in this part of the world) owe allegiance, but we presume it is to Abu Dhabi. At any rate we hope so, for if they owe allegiance to no one in particular we may find King Ibn Saud inducing them without very much difficulty to admit that they owe allegiance to him. In that case, despite the fact that Baraimi lies north and east of the line we have offered to King Ibn Saud, we should be likely to find it difficult to keep him out of Baraimi for, as we have suggested before, we cannot hold him, or indeed anyone else, back behind a vacuum. 4. Even, therefore, though there may be no need to adhere to the original proposals so far as the needs of Petroleum Concessions Limited are concerned, we hope that the journeys as nownow projected will take place as arranged and that they will result in enabling substantial progress to be made towards determining the limits of the areas effectively controlled by the Trucial Sheikhs or (in that area) the Sultan of Muscat 0 5 0 I am sending copies of this letter to Seal, Saundby and Starling.[N.B.— This is an ORIGINAL message sent by AIR MAIL which provides a means of communieation more expeditious than the ordinary mail and is cheaper than the telegraph.

The Sul tan* s attitude in his discussions with Mr. Long- rigg is what I had expected. The main factor is that until the Sultan can, somehow or other, arrange for the Company to operate in the Onan hinterland, where oil is most likely to be found, hr has no chance of drawing his royalties. This, of course, ia a considerable inducement to the Sultan to make such arrangements, either through the Imam or otherwise. in the meantime te will have to wait until his return to his kingdom in May next.

Dated 8th December 1937 Ho.T/102 X forward herewith a note on the discussions between the Jultan of Muscat and Mr. Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Ltd^/held at Bombay on November 24 at which 1 was present. discussions was mostly a negative one since the Sultan refused to commit himself to stating whether those parts of his dominions in which the Company were most interested i6the western foothills of the Oman a 4 mountain range could be visited by geologists under arrangements to be made by him or not. The reason for the Sultan's attitude is, of course, that as he has no control whatsoever over the Oman he is not in a position at present to say whether he will be able or not to arrange for the Company's employees to prospect there for oil. 3. According to the Sultan in recent conversations I had with him shortly before leaving Muscat the authority of the Imam over the Oman is dwindling and I think that the Sultan has hopes that when he returns from his world tour next year he may be able to get into direct touch with many of the tribes now controlled by the Imam and arrange with them to all^w prospecting parties to explore their territory. (I am submitting a separate report on the situation in the Oman on my return to Muscat.) Whatever may be the outcome of the Sultan's intrigues with the Oman 2 . As will be seen therefrom the result of theL tribes X think there iu no ttoubt that at present none of the Company's employees could visit or prospect in that region without the sanction and good offices of the Xfflfcia himself vide paragraph 2 of my tolegraf) No. 106 dated 18th October 1327. 4. J£r. Longrigg expressed himself as disappointed at the negative result of his discussions with the Sultan but I pointed out that his Company by the insertion in their own Agreement of article 12 were evidently aware of the fact that certain areas of the Sultanate were not under the control of the muscat Government. 5. Prior to our meeting with the Sultan Ur. Longrigg and myself had a short talk in which I gave him a general idea of the Political situation in the &gt;ultan&amp;te« Ur. Longrigg asked me whether I thought it advisable for him to discuss with the Sultan the question of hia meeting the Imam. I said that in view of the Sultan's very strong objections to this proposal (Vide paragraph 1 of ray tolegram No.106 of 18th October 1927) I saw no useful purpose in it being raised. Ur. Lcngrigg agreed ana the question was not mentioned at all during the interviews with the Sultan. 6. Although nothing definite was accomplished at this interview one useful result w&amp;s» I think, brought about in making a Representative of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. realise tne situation prevailing in the Sultanate. It also enabled Hr. Longrigg acting on behalf of hia Company to make personal contact with the Sultan who expressed himself very pleased at making his acqaintance. He was still more pleased when on saying good bye Hr. Longrigg presented him with an expensive camera for use on his world tour which present was particularly gratifying to the (J*l) CJ&lt;dto- 3ultan who is k een photographer.^ „ a. f' 3fc^ Note on discussion at meeting held at Bombay on November 24th between H.3. the Sultan of Muscat and Mr. S.H.Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. at which Major R.P.Watta Political Agent f Muscat was present. Mr. Longrigg first explained to the Sultan what areaiin the Sultanate his Company considered, from information available, were the most likely to be of geological interest. He said that the coastal region lying between the mountains and the sea north of Muscat known as Batinah was of little interest to the Company also the extreme north of the Mussandum Peninsular. The coastal region south of Muscat more especially that between Has al Had upto Ras Phabit Ali might be of somewhat more interest and the Company desired to carry out exploration of those parts. The portion of the Sultanate, however, which the Company considered to be best deserving of exploration was, Mr. Longrigg declared, the western foothills of the main Oman mountain range* 2. Mr. Longrigg asked whether the Sultan could make arrangements for prospecting parties to visit and explore this region whenever the Company desired and provide measures to ensure their safety. The Sultan replied that at the present moment he was quite unable to state in any definite manner whether suitable arrangements could be made or not. He would of course as provided under articlel| 12 of the oil concession use his good offices to provide for the safe conduct of the personnel of the Company visiting any place in his dominions, but owing to the peculiar conditions prevailing in the Oman it would be necessary for him to make careful inquiries into the matter begore he could commit himself to saying whether he could arrange for such a reconnaisance in those districts or not since he would not be returning from his world tour2 until May of next year some time must elapse before he could give a definite answer to this question. Mr. Longrigg said that though the Company did not intend to carry out any active work until the autumn of 1938 they desireJ?to know as clearly as possible, in advance, what programme could be made for their prospecting parties in order that the numrous arrange ments and preparations necessary might be put in hand at an early date. The Sultan said that at this time he was quite unable to commit himself to any sort of definite reply as to what portions of the territory mentioned by Mr. Longrigg as being of interest to the Company could be visited. 3. As regards the south eastern coastal portion of his territory i.e. that between Has al Had and Has Lhabat All the Sultan said that he thought there would be no difficulty after his return to Muscat next year, in arranging for the Company’s employees to travel and prospect from the coast as far as the western limits of the Sultanate i.e. the beginning of the ^jreat £ands and as far as the territory belonging to Ibn Baud. Ehofar, the Sultan declared, was well under his control and the only two important aheikhs of the remaining portion of the coastal range were the Sheikhs of Mahut and Masirah with both of whoip he was well acquainted and who were amenable to his authority. 4. Mr. Longrigg mentioned that his company might s desire to carry out some aerial reconnaisances of the Sultanate and asked whether the Sultan had any objection to their aeroplanes using the existing landing grounds made for the Royal Air ^orce. The Sultan said he had no objection but stressed the importance of ample notice being given in order thatthe Sheikhs and Headmen of the districts to he flown over should he aware of the identity of the visiting Upto &amp;eropl&amp;nes«/X&amp;fclUt the present 9 the Sultan explain*** only Royal Air Force Aeroplanes had visited his Arabian territories and the sudden appearance of another type of aeroplane and of persons not belonging to the Royal Air Force might lead to misunderstandings and perhaps unpleasantness from the local inhabitants* Mr. Longrigg promised that as long warning as possible of all flights projected would be given. Mr* Longrigg asked what would probably happen if one of the £oinpanY's aeroplanes was obliged to make a forced descent in the interior of the country. The Sultan said that though he sincerely hoped that no harm would come to the occupants of the aeroplane 9 apart from the coastal belt where he was able to iiXfiU£X.diK exercise some control over the inhabitants* he was quite unable to say what would happen and certainly could accept no responsibility for the safety of their lives* Mr* Longrigg suggested that it might be desirable to have a representative of the Muscat Government in the aeroplane when engaged on such flights and the Sultan agreed saying for each district visited belonging to the local tribe should be taken* 5* Mr* Longrigg called on the Sultan again on the 25th accompanied by the Political Agent* to say Good bye as he was leaving for the c^ulf that evening. The only official subject spoken about was the question raised by Mr. Longrigg at the prior suggestion of the Political Agent of the degree of responsibility the Sultan accepted for the actual coastal region with particular respect to the safety of the personnel of any air craft belonging to the company which might land there* The Sultan said that so far as responsibility went even in the landing grounds he— CONFIDENTIAL.

After further discussion v/ith Fowle we came to the conclusion that, since at present we are only faced v/ith the question of preliminary exploration, it would be unnecessary for us at this stage to investigate the validity of rights claimed by the Coastal Shaikhs in areas which are not effectively controlled by them, and that it would be sufficient if deps were taken to put the Company in touch v/ith the most likely persons to help them in regard to the particular areas in which they were interested. Fowle * s letter to Longrigg of the 10th December (a copy of which is enclosed herewith) explains what has been done so far in this direction. No doubt we shail have difficulties if as \ \ a result of preliminary surveys the Company^wish to obtain a concession for some area in the hinterland which is not within tne effective control of a coastal Shaikh, bu£ we think Vt will be time enough to deal with such a problem when it arises.3. With regard to Ihe suggestion for an aerial reconnaissance of the areas concerned (see para.7 of Powle’s letter to Longrigg of 10th December), I enclose) ( for your information, a copy of a record of an informal meeting which was held at the Air Ministry on the 20th October together v/ith a copy of a letter dated 25th October from P.C.L. on the subject. We have since heard that the Air Ministry agree in principle and that details are being discussed with the Company. 4. As regards Muscat, you may like to know that Longrigg was to have met the Sultan in Bombay to discuss plans for exploration work in Muscat territory. By arrangement Watts, or some other member of the Indian Political Department, was to have been present at any meetings between Longrigg and the Sultan connected with oil matters and we have asked India to let us have a full report of any discussions which take place. 5.

The Shaikh of Ajm&amp;n informed me that, should your Company wish to wend a party to this area, he could arrange for this to bs done at about a week’s notice. 3. Jabal Falyah . Situated in territory claimed by the Shaikh of Sharjah, about 30 miles from the coast. The Shaikh of Sharjah informed me that he would consider the matter of a geological party risltlng this area, and hoped to be able to arrange for this by nsxt January.

There are four Shaikh* who appear to hare oome eert of authority over JabaX Hafit l*e« 1. Shaikh Hash id bin Hamad of Al bu Shamie (the moat influential). 2. ftaqar bin Sultan of the Naim. 3. Mohammad bin Sultan of the Haim, and 4. Mohammad bin R&amp;haman of the AX bu Shamie. Under my instructions lap tain fallow ay is eriting to Shaikh Has hid informing him that your Company wish to send geologist! to Jabal Hafit ae soon as possible with the object of finding out whether the area is a likely oil bearing one. The party would consist of Uaptain Galloway, the Residency Agent and two or three geologists, ./ould Shaikh Has hid be so good as to come down to Sharjah accompanied by any other important Shaikhs whom he thinks should bs consulted, and discuss arxangsmsnta? He should give some previous notlcs of his coming and details of his party in order that arrange* ments may be made for a Company 1 * representative to be present. I understand that your Company attach special importance to Jabal Unfit, and even if a visit there cannot be arranged in the insaediate future I think that personal contact between Captain Galloway and the representatlveejof the Coup any and Shaikh Rashid should be a useful step towards ultimate success in this direction. 5. You will note that Captain Galloway and the Residency Agent will accompany the geological party to Jabal Hafit. They will also accompany the party to any ether areas in the hinterland, and no visit of course will be made until the Shaikhs in question give adequate guarantees for the safety of the party, and until I am satisfied that tae visit can be made without risk. 6.

I pointed out to the Sultan that it was equally to the advantage of his State as well as to Jhat of tne Irucial shaikhs that the ambiguity con cerning their respective boundaries should be cleared up especially at the present time when an active search for oil was about to be carried out in those regions. X asked the Sultan what he proposed to do if retroieum Concessions Limited, to whom he had sold the right to prospect for oil any where in tne Arabian portion of his dominions, should declare that during the coming autumn they desired to examine ground in the vicinity of the supposed boundary and wished to be informed what exactly were tne limits of the Sultanate. The Sultan replied that in that event he would want to know from the Company the exact places they wished to visit; he would then state whether they were within Muscat territory or not and if so he would send representatives to act as guides for the Company*s employees in their journeys provided the particular urhmmmmwi I |||»H4X.^X^ . rfr-m nnirtfi im places were coxisiaered s&amp;fe for such a purpose. 3.

The Sultan became indignant on hearing this and declared Bairami definitely beloi%'ed to Muscat, one of the chief proofs of which was tnat he paid the Headman a retaining fee 1 On a previous occasion the sultan admitted that he received no payment of taxes from that district and 1 gathered that tney never nad been paid - certainly not/not regularly. 4* A definition of the western land boundaries of Muscat State though no doubt not by any means an easy task., owing to the absence of properly maintained records and above all to the backward condition of the State Administration! is far from being impossible, but 1 tnink that the sultan has not the least intention of carrying it out nor will he willingly co-operate in the work of any investigation under the //v Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, t© the Trueis1 Coast Hinterland next autumn - vide your telegram quoted in paragraph 3 above. 5. In my opinion the Sultan shojla be informed that if he persists in his refusal to co-operate and put forward a statement at least of his claims to Bairami and his boundary in that neighbourhood and other parties interested are able to make out a prima facie case for themselves, His Majesty's dovernment may accept their claims as against the Muscat Government ex parte.

The proposals 7/ill be examined in more detail in regard to the amount of flying effort involved and we will v/rite to you again in the near future. In the meantime I forward two copies of the record of the first meeting which include those minor amendments suggested by you. Jt/l. J.P. Gibson Esq., India Office, LOUDON, S.W.l.RECORD of an Informal Meeting held at the Air Ministry on the 20th October, 1937, to examine the possibility of the Royal Air Force affording assistance to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, in carrying out a preliminary Air Survey in the hinterland of the TRUCIAL Coast and the Sultanate of MUSCAT. Present : O/Capt. R.H.M.3.Saundby, M.C., D.F.C., A.F.C., Deputy Director of 0 erations. Lt.-Col. Sir frenchard Fowlq, K.C.I.L., C.B.E., Resident in Persian Gulf. Wing-Comoander H.B.Russell, D.F.C., A.F.C., Air Ministry. Mr. Longrigg) Mr. Baker ) Petroleum Concessions, Limited. Mr. Lewisohn) Sir Trenchard Fowle opening the discussion, explained that it appeared very desirable to establish whether oil existed in coimaercial quantities in the interior of the Trucial sheikhdoms, in Muscat, and in Oman, especially in view of the fact that the great majority of active producing wells in tie Persian Gulf area are at present situate in foreign territory - Iran. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., who held the necessary concessions (or options) to survey for oil in practically all the territories under discussion had done what they could to examine these areas on the ground on foot and by car, but owing to the physical conditions and local political considerations, they had been unable to penetrate far from the coast. Moreover political difficulties might well delay the carrying out of an adequate ground survey in these regions for a considerable period of time. In consequence Sir Trenchard had himself suggested that it might be possible to enlist the assistance of the Royal Air Force in carrying out a preliminary air survey of this area. It was very unlikely that flights by R.A.F. aircraft over the area would be open to any political objection. 2. Group Captain Saundby said that doubtless such air survey would be of value not only to Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., but also to the political authorities. It was Air Ministry policy, however, not to undertake anything in the nature of an air survey which could equally well be carried out by civil air survey firms, as to do so would be hindering the development of such Companies. Moreover, the time involved in undertaking such work over any large area was usually a great deal more than could be sparedfrom units’ normal duties and training. It might be difficult to secure approval for this suggestion unless it was for some definite defence purpose, although he was not prepared to say that maps of this particular area would not be of value to the R.A.F.3. Sir Trenchard Fowle pointed out that the objections which applied to ground survey would in all probability a^ply with almost equal force to flights over this territory by a civil firm. Such objections would not apply to flights by R.A. F. aircraft and he agreed that a map of this area might well be of value to the R.A.F. as well as to the political authorities. 4. Mr. Longrigg then explained that what was required was not so much an air survey as generally understood by this term, but an air reconnaissance coupled with the taking of a number of oblique photographs of such points as seemed desirable as a result of visual examination by geologists from the air. 5. Mr. Baker, geologist, further explained that the most promising areas lay within some 100 miles of the coast and that,while Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., would like to survey the whole area lying to the east of a line drawn south from approximately Yas Island to its point of intersection with Lat. 220 North, thence eastwards along that iaeridian to the coast, a preliminary reconnaissance coverim the area lying between the Trucial Coast and the Coast of Muscat and a line drawn roughtly from Abu Dhabi to Has ohai-feloh on the Coast of Quasi would suffice. 6. Sir Trenchard Fowle suggested that Sharjah would be a suitable base. 7. Group Captain Saundby stated that at first sight, provided air reconraissance and occasional obliques only were required the Siaaller area mentioned by Mr. Baker should be within the capacity of two or three aircraft, but before the suggestion could be fully considered, it was essential to know more exactly what was required. He emphasised, however, that if R.A.F. assistance were finally agreed upon, it might be necessary to withdraw the aircraft at any time and at short notice if the exigencies of the Service required their presence elsewhere. 8. Mr. Longrigg said that the last point was fully understood. In regard to the first, he would arrange with his Company to forward a statement of the area they wished to survey and such details as might assist in arriving at the amount of flying effort involved in their suggestions. 9. Sir Trenchard Fowle agreed that this would be the best course to adopt but considered that the statement referred to by Mr. Longrigg in para. 8 above should be forwarded through the India Office as the Governmental Authority, and for record purposes. 10. Group Captain S undby promised to examine the proposal when these details had been received by Air Ministry.291) a ^ ^ 'M: i% Trucial Coast Oil Concessions . Sir F. otewart . Please see Sir T. Fowle's note below, in which he suggests a modification of his plan for enabling the Company to do exploratory work in the interior. of preliminary exploration, the result of which in many, or perhaps all, of the areas may be negative, in which case nothing more will presumably be required. Sir T. Fowle f s revised plan, as outlined in para. 7 of his note, has the merit that at this exploratory stage it would be unnecessary for us to express any opinion as to the validity of claims to areas which were not effectively controlled - save to the extent of informing the Coy. to which of the Trucial Sheikhs they should apply for an introduction to the inhabitants of each particular area. In cases where a Trucial Sheikh effectively controls an area, the matter is of course straightforward. difficulty, if exploration shows a need of further examination of any areas, and if any of these areas At present we are only faced with the question Looking ahead, we shall still have aare not effectively controlled by a 'concession” Sheikh, In this event it seems to me that we shall have to assess . the claims of the 'concession' Sheikhs, in order to let the Coy. know where they stand. If we did not, there would apparently be no alternative but to allow the ^oy. to take a new concession from the hinterland authority, which would mean that we would either have to abandon all control of the Coy.'s proceedings in that quarter, or enter into relations with the hinterland Sheikh and thus undertake new commitments. V/e might, of course, have to do this even after assessing the claims of the coastal Sheikhs, if we found that they were not valid; but we ought at any rate first to see what we thought of such claims. This difficulty, however, will only arise on the double hypothesis mentioned above, so that we may perhaps wait before considering it further. Independently of the new plan there is the possibility of an air survey. We will see whether this turns out to be practicable.^T^have told hr. Longrigg that the Coy. is not to attach any importance to the use in the previous d.o. correspondence of the terns 'de jur e' and ' He facto ' (see note of interview on 19th October). JuJMr. Walton . With reference to the conversation v/hich we had with Sir Pindlater Stewart on the subject of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. and the Trucial Coast, you will remember that you thought it might be useful if I wrote a Note generally expressing my views which Sir Pindlater might be interested to see. 2. Briefly, the situation is that P.C.L. have obtained, or are on the point of obtaining, concessions from the Trucial Coast Sheikhs and have carried out some geological surveys along the Coast, the result of v/hich has been to show that this coastal area is not productive from the oil point of view. On the other hand, the Company are of the opinion that the Trucial Coast hinterland on the fringe of the hills , with some other areas short of these hills v/here there are outcrops of a rocky nature, e.g. Jebal Paiyan and Jebal Hafit, might offer better prospects for oil. They tbefore wish to make geological surveys of these areas. 3. A difficulty, however, arises in regard to the surveys as follows. Taking what v/e may call the ’'concession Sheikhs as a whole, between them they probably have de jure rights to all the territory which the Company now v/ish to explore; the remainder of this territory being subject to Muscat, in which State P.C.L. likewise have a concession. But effective control by these Sheikhs in the hinterland is not commensurate with their probable de jure rights. This being so, there are a number of petty Sheikhs in the interior who are, to a greater or less extent, de facto Sheikhs of their local areas, and the ’’concession” Sheikhs probably have not sufficient authority to guarantee the safety of geological parties in these areas unless they come to some arrangement/arrangement with the de facto Sheikhs. 4. It will he seen that in the preceding paragraph I have used the expression 'probable' in connection with the de .jure rights of the Sheikhs in the hinterland. Until oil came into the Trucial Coast picture the barren hinterland was of little interest either to us or to the Sheikhs. The Coast was always the concern of either the Sheikhs or ourselves, and here the limits of the Sheikhs are known, and not in dispute except for a strip between Debai and Abu Dhabi. There was no need to delimit the hinterland limits of the Sheikhdoms and no attempt to do so was made. Until, therefore, P.C.L. a few months ago raised the question of exploring the hinterland, we had practically no information as to what were the extent of the territories of the 'concession' Sheikhs in the interior. Arising out of the P.C.L. exploration proposal, under my instruction a map was prepared by Captain Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrein, shov/ing what territories these Sheikhs claimed in the interior. This map merely records the Sheikh^ own views of their claims, and we are in no way committed to endorsing these. In his accompanying Note, Captain Hickinbotham shows how much of the claimed territory each Sheikh more or less effectively controls. 5. So far as the Company are concerned with the difficulties v/hich may hinder or delay them in exploring the hinterland, they were well aware of these before they obtained their concessions with the various Sheikhs. Their first step was about two years or so ago to obtain options from the Sheikhs under which they could carry out preliminary geological surveys. This they have been doing and have been perfectly aware of local conditions. In this connection ite 400 ) 1 zw. 3 is perhaps important to note that in the various Agreements the Company and the Sheikhs, the term 'territory' has 'been used without any attempt to define it. 6. Hov/ever, even though the Company have 'been aware of the difficulties of hinterland exploration, we naturally want to help them to the best of our ability in this direction. In this connection Sir Pindlater expressed some doubts as to the advisability of our taking up v/hat may be called a de .jure position, at any rate at the present juncture; and to the use of this expression which might be interpreted by quarters outside the Gulf - Geneva, for example - as committing H. M. G. to international obligation in the interior, e. g. in the direction of the suppression of slavery. Sir Pindlater was of the opinion that it might perhaps be better to work rather on the following lines. Supposing Sheikh A is a 'concession' Sheikh and Sheikh X a petty Sheikh in his territory, or at all events under his influence, whose area the Company wish to explore. We would then. Sir Pindlater suggested, inform the Company, without raising the question of Sheikh A’s de jure rights, that our information indicated that Sheikh A was the most likely person to help them in regard to Sheikh X. 7. After reflection, I think that it should be quite possible to work on these lines. The Company would make personal contacts with Sheikh X through Sheikh A, and presumably offer Sheikh X a cash sum down in return for permission to explore his territory. Since it would, of course, be to the immediate advantage of Sheikh X to take the cash present, and to the ultimate advantage of Sheikh A that a likely oil area in his territory (i.e. territory claimed by him or under his influence) should be explored by the Company, I (options and concessions) which have been concluded between dare/dare say that after innumerable cups of coffee had been drunk and many hours had been spent in talk an arrangement would be come to between the Company and Sheikh X. Should Sheikh X raise the question of how his oil rights stood in case oil were found in his area, it would be explained to him that the first thing to do was to find out whether oil is likely to be found there at all. Naturally I would not permit the Company^ party to visit Sheikh X^ area unless the latter gave suitable guarantees for their safety, and unless I was personally satisfied that the visit could be made in safety. The Company’s party would also be accompanied by one of my Political Officers or by myself. 8. The result of the visit of the exploration party to Sheikh X*s area would be to show either that his area had possibilities of oil, or not. If the former, then further steps would have to be considered in due course. If the latter, then Sheikh X and his possible oil rights in relation to Sheikh A would concern us and the Company no longer. The same procedure could be carried out step by step with the other ,, concession ,, and petty Sheikhs concerned. 9. The term '’exploring’ 1 which I have used for the operations of the Company may suggest a more formidable undertaking than it really is. From what Mr. Longrigg (of P. C.L. ) told us, it appears that a geological party (which consists merely of a couple of geologists) can get a negative result, i.e. be in a position to say there are no hopes of oil in any particular area by merely casting their eyes over it, and they can class any area as a possible one for oil by a further exploration of a few days. 10. Before attempting the procedure outlined in paragraph 7 above, it occurred to me that an air survey of the/rr * 1 '' rMm &gt; AVW + '&gt;1* the areas which the Company wish to explore, carried out hy the R. A. F. might he useful, on the lines of a previous air survey carried out hy the R. A. F, at Bahrein. As a tentative proposal, this was approved hy Sir Findlater, and the position is as follows. The first approach, hy an informal conversation, was to the Company to ascertain whether such a survey would he of use to them, and the reply was in the affirmative. The R.A.F. were then approached in an informal conversation at the Air Ministry with Group Captain Saundhy, at which myself, Mr. Longrigg, Mr. Baker and Mr. Lewisohn of P. C. L. were present, and the Company* s representatives stated generally what their desiderata were. Group Captain Saundhy was sympathetic to the proposal hut said that naturally at this stage he could not commit his higher authorities. If, however, the Company would submit in further detail their requirements the project would he further considered. The Company have promised to do this through the India Office, and when «r their communication^ have heen received, I propose, in company with the Company*s representatives, having another informal conversation with Group Captain Saundhy. If, as a result of this conversation, the R.A.F. are prepared to undertake the survey, the proposal can he put up for the formal sanction of the higher authorities concerned: the Air Ministry and India Office. 11. One point which is of some importance is that the Company*s geologists will in any case, whether the air or ground surveys go through or not, he in the Gulf based at Bahrain. There is thus no question of the Company sending out an expensive geological party for the express purpose of exploring the hinterland. When and if required, their geologists will he available on the spot (it is only a few/ W i\ 6 /* % few hours flight from Bahrain to the Trucial Coast) either for the air survey (the geologists will accompany the flights) or for the survey on the ground as opportunity affords. 12. In our discussion with Sir Pindlater it was suggested that on return to the Gulf I might investigate further the de .jure rights of the ’ , concession ,, Sheikhs. In view, however, of the procedure outlined in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, it might be better for the present to let this question drop. The map referred to in paragraph 4 above gives us very useful information as to the territorial claims of the Sheikhs. When v/e know, as a result of the Company’s preliminary geological surveys, what areas, if any, they actually wish to operate in, we can make further investigation into the de .jure question. a.■rm mr A^y^LEPHONE ^AND NATIONAL 3582 TELEGRAMS : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON V i /&gt;.' / J i ^ 193 7 Lf-O*}' &lt;4P5‘ ] CODES : BENTLEY S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED DIRECTORS : Sir John Cadman, G.C.M.G. {Chairman) A.

Baker, our Chief Geologist, together with three copies of three maps which are supplementary to the said note. The note and maps will, we hope, give the authorities at the Air Ministry a sufficient picture of our requirements to enable them to examine, in as much detail as is necessary at this stage, the proposed flights. If there is room for three passengers on the planes which would be used, we should like the seats to be occupied by two geologists, whom we should supply, and one photographer whom we hope the R.A.F. would supply. If there is only room for two passengers then we would like to send up one geologist and one photographer, but if there is room for only one passenger, then the seat should be reserved for one geologist. We shall have two geologists down on the Persian Gulf this winter and they could be made available for these flights at any time, subject to a wefck or two T s notice. The Company would, of course, be prepared to pay any direct expenses incurred on the proposed flights, such as for petrol and oil consumed and for the salary of personnel during the period of the flights.

S.W.lTentative Programme of Aerial Reconnaissance in Oman For consideration by the India Office and the Air Ministry It is tne wish to make geological observations of the areas indicated below, from aeroplane flights, supplementing these observations by- oblique aerial photographs. Reconnaissance is required of two areas a) The western and south-western foothill region of the Oman Mountains b) The hinterland of Abu Dhabi state The following proposals are put forward purely from a geological point of view, without definite knowledge of:- * A “A: I 1. 2 . fir- i Flying possibilities, i.e. the ran^e of the aircraft that may be available and landing grounds and other facilities. The depth of the area from the coast that may be covered without tres passing on Saudi Arabi a. The present status of tne uompany is that we have concessions over the territories of the Sultan of Muscat and the states of Sharjah and Dubai; and options over the states of Abu Dhabi and A1 Ajman. It will be for the India Office and R.A.F. to say how much of the proposed work it is possible to carry out. Two alternative programmes are outlined to show the type of reconnaissance we wish to do. Programme A - To cover the ground thoroughly, if the flights are possible a) The Foothill Region This is the more important area, and we should like to cover it by SW - 15E and NE - SW flights at about 20 mile intervals; and to supplement observations with a series of oblique photographs./ f I ■ 2 - The average width oi* the area to be covered, as shown in Map A, is about 60 miles. The overall length of the Oman arc is about 400 miles. b) Abu Dhabi State It is not desired to do this area in such detail as the above. Three flights, as shown, from Yas Island and Abu Dhabi, and one from Abu Dhabi inland and thence to Sharjah would probably be sufficient for present purposes. The length of these flignts would be 200 - 250 miles each. Programme B - In case Sharjah is the only usable landing ground for the eastern area a) ffoothill Region The area to be covered would depend on the range of flight of the plane. It is suggested that two flights be made from Sharjah, more or less parallel to the mountains, as shown in Map B, the outward and return halves being spaced at about 15 miles interval. The southern part of the area might possibly be covered in a similar manner from the Muscat or other landing ground. b) Abu Dhabi State As before, if possible. It woulc oe desirable to fly at an elevation of about 10,000 feet for photography, but geological observations by eye can be made effectively at lower elevations down to 5,000 feet. On Map C, the areas of relative geological importance are shownDraft Paper 4\o DRA.7T LETTER. ( Wing Cdr. H.B.Rusaell,DFC•,AFC., Air Ministry, Adastral House.

Sytnon, Esq., India Office, S.W.l. i Yours —^ DRAFT. Record of an Informal Meeting held at the Air Ministry on the 20th October, 1937, to examine the possibility of the Royal Air Force affording assistance to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, in carrying out a preliminary Air Survey in the hinterland of the TRUCIAL Coast and the Sultanate of MUSCAT. Present : G/Capt. R.H.M.S. Saundby, M.C., D.F.C., A.F.C., Deputy Director of Operations. Lt.-Col. Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Resident in Persian Gulf. Wing-Commander H.B. Russell, D.F.C., A.F.C., Air Ministry. Mr. Longrigg ) Mr. Baker ) Petroleum Concessions, Limited. Mr. Lewisohn ) Sir Trenchard Fowle opening the discussion, explained that it appeared very desirable to establish whether oil existed in commercial quantities in the interior of the Trucial sheikhdoms in Muscat and in Oman, especially in view of the fact that the great majority of active producing wells in the Persian Gulf area are at present situate in foreign territory - Iran. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., who held the necessary f tr* A &gt; i* /Aa concessions to survey for oil in t&amp;e territories under discussion had done what they could to examine these areas on the ground on foot and by car, but owing to the physical conditions and local political considerations, they had been unable to penetrate far from the coast. Moreover political difficulties might well delay the carrying out of an adequate ground survey in these regions for a considerable period of time. In consequence Sir Trenchard had himseli suggested that it might be possible to enlist the assistance of the Royal Air Force in carrying out a preliminary air survey of this area. It was very unlikely that flights by R.A.F. aircraft over the area would be open to any political objection.2. Group Captain Saundby said that doubtless such air survey would be of value not only to Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., but also to the political authorities. It was Air Ministry policy, however, not to undertake anything in the nature of an air survey which could equally well be carried out by civil air survey firms, as to do so would be hindering the development of such Companies. Moreover, the time involved in undertaking such work over any large area was usually a great deal more than could be spared from units’ normal duties and training. It might be difficult to secure approval for this suggestion unless it was for some definite defence purpose, although he was not prepared to say that maps of this particular area might not be of value to the R.A.P. 3. Sir Trenchard Powle pointed out that the objections which applied to ground survey would in all probability apply with almost equal force to flights over this territory by a civil firm. Such objections would not apply to flights by R.A.P. aircraft and he agreed that a map of this area might well be of value to the R.A.P. as well as to the political authorities. 4. Mr. Longrigg then explained that what was required was not so much an air survey, as generally understood by this term, but an air reconnaissance coupled with the taking of a number of oblique photographs of such points as seemed desirable as a result of visual examination by geologists from the air. 5. Mr. Baker, geologist, further explained that the most promising areas lay within some 100 miles of the coast and that while Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., would like to survey the whole area lying to the east of a line drawn south from approximately Yas Island to its point of intersection with Lat. 22° North, thence eastwards /along» K' 4^ 3 along that meridian to the coast, a preliminary reconnaissance covering the area lying between the Trucial Coast and the Coast of Muscat and a line drawn roughly from Abu Dhabi to Has Shaiblah on the Coast of Oman would sufficed 6. Sir Trenchard Powle suggested that Sharjah would be a suitable base. 7. Group Captain Saundby stated that at first sight, provided air reconnaissance and occasional obliques only were required the smaller area mentioned by Mr. Baker should be within the capacity of two or three aircraft, but before the suggestion could be fully considered, it was essential to know more exactly what was required. He emphasised, however, that if R.A.F. assistance were finally agreed upon, it might be necessary to withdraw the aircraft at any time and at short notice if the exigencies of the Service required their presence elsewhere. 8. Mr. Longrigg said that the last point was fully understood. In regard to the first, he would arrange with his Company to forward a statement of the area they wished to survey and such details as might assist in arriving at the amount of flying effort involved in their suggestions. 9. Sir Trenchard Fowle agreed that this would be the best course to adopt but considered that the statement referred to by Mr. Longrigg in para. 8 above should be forwarded through the India Office as the Governmental Authority, and for record purposes. 10. Group Captain Saundby promised to examine and the proposal when these details had been received in Air Ministry.5lifi7 5000 2.37 Draft Paper f4ie&gt; 7 &lt; T2.

(/w^ i- —4^ / &gt;. oXm/Lc 'VV&lt;^ u -i —, ^ These papers deal with the matter referred to in Mr. Garoe’s telegram of 24th September (flag C). The Company had suggested that in exploring the hinterland of the Trucial Coast they might pay their way with the local tribes and Sheikhs, who may not acknowledge the authority of the coast Sheikhs. Sir T. Fowle has suggested that the better plan (though it involves delay for the Coy.) is to deal only with the coast Sheikhs themselves, from whom the Coy. holds its concessions, and to get them to do what is necessary to ensure that petty authorities inland do not hinder the exploration. This plan involves as a first step determining the areas of jurisdiction which we are prepared to recognise as belonging to each coast Sheikh - in fact, determining their boundaries inter se and vis- a- vis Muscat. The complication of Ibn Saud^ claims does not enter into the matter, as the claim which he himself put forward in the recent negotiations (marked ^ with &amp; red - line in the top map on the file) does not ^ A \ extend to the areas which the Coy. desire to explore. *4 L ^ ^ y/e had a meeting with Mr. Longrigg on 29th ^ ZZZZZ y w ^ L ^ ^ t 1 September/September. Mr. Longrigg wished it not to be supposed that his Coy. are prepared simply to sterilise their concessions without exploring, but agreed that there was no urgency about exploration, and that it would be better to proceed according to Sir T. Fowle f s plan and that the Coy.'s plans for the coming season could be postponed. There are even greater difficulties about exploring some at any rate of the Muscat areas, and the Coy. will proceed cautiously here also, and in the first instance through the Sultan. The Coy. are therefore prepared not-to do any exploration this winter. Since the meeting, however, Sir 7. Fowle has made a suggestion which seems well worth considering, viz ., that it might be possible to arrange for an air survey of the Trucial Coast hinterland with the aid of the R.A.F. If this suggestion proves practicabl it might be possible after all to let the Coy. send its geologists by air over part of the area during the coming season, without having to incur the risks that might be involved in sending a party by land before the questions of jurisdiction, etc., are settled. Perhaps you would like to discuss the question with SirT. Fowle some time. n ^ ^Register No. P. Z. 6341/37 SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.

While negotiations have been proceeding between the Company and the Rulers concerned, exploration work has been carried on. The Company^ geologists have now covered all the accessible areas and they now wish to push ahead with the remaining areas. 4. Preliminary enquiries made by the local Political Authorities indicate that all the territory which the Company now wishes to explore belongs de jure either to one of the Trucial Sheikhs or to the Sultan of Muscat. On the other hand, most of the Trucial hinterland is undeij* the de facto control of petty local Sheikhs, while the major portion of the Muscat hinterland is controlled by In such circumstances the Political Resident fearsfthat if any attempt is made to explore the territory in question before more is known of the de facto position, the Company will (apart from other difficulties) find themselves put to considerable expense since the prospect of oil being discovered might make some of the numerous petty de facto Sheikhs open X their mouths rather v/ide. The Resident thinks, therefore, that as a first step the local Political Authorities should ascertppn from the Rulers concerned what part of the hinterland is claimed by them respectively together with the grounds for their claims. When this has been done a provisional ruling can be given as to the de jure position in any case in v/hich the claims of two Rulers conflict.

He has accordingly suggested that some area to v/hich the Company v/ished to send an exploration party should be chosen for the purpose, and that the Ruler in v/hose territory the selected area is situated should, in his capacity of overlord, address the petty de facto Sheikh concerned to the effect that an exploration party was visiting it. Should the Sheikh raise no objections all would be well, but if difficulties were encountered it would be for the Ruler to bring the Sheikh round. This might be achieved by either offering an inducement to the petty Sheikh concerned in the shape of a substantial present from the money received from the Company or by payment of a percentage of the royalties if oil is subsequently found in the area. 5. The above procedure will of course take time but the Company are fully alive to the difficulties of the sjfcuation, and as a result of the discussions with Sir Trenchard Powle on 29th September Mr. Longrigg, on behalf of P.C.L., has agreed that it might be best for the Company to give up all ideas of exploring in the Trucial hinterland this winter, during which time the local Political Authorities would continue investigations on the lines suggested by the Political Resi dent^ The present idea is that the investigations should be conducted by the Assistant Political Agent vdio v/ould make his headquarters at Sharjah or some other point in the territories concerned, and it is not unlikely that at an early stage he will discover that there are some areas in which it would be perfectly safe/ 4 37 10Psafe for the Company 1 s geologists to undertake exploration v/ork. If this proves to be the case, it may be possible for the Company to make some progress this winter since they are in any case seeding- two geologists who will make their headquarters on -the- Truclal Go^at. The need for a cautious policy is such, however, that at this stage all that seems necessary to tell the (r Company in our view it would be best to adhere •/ to the procedure suggested by the Political Resident. Much will depend on the progress made by the Assistant Political Agent, and Sir Trenchard Fov/le intends to visit the Trucial Coast immediately on his return to the Gulf in order to look into the matter personally. He has tentatively suggested that parts of the hinterland might be surveyed by the Royal Air Force (at the expense of the Company) and this question will be examined separately. 6. If it is necessary to proceed with caution in the case of the hinterland of the Trucial Coast, it is even more necessary to proceed cautiously when dealing with Muscat territory. Mr. Longrigg fully realises this and he is anxious to see the Sultan personally (either at Muscat or in India during the period of the Sultan^ forthcoming visit to the Viceroy) to discuss the problem. He also has an idea that it might be a good thing if he could see the Imam of Liuoca^ in order to discuss ways and means of exploring the hinterland controlled by that Potentate. We have promised to ascertain the Sultan 1 s wishes and to consider his proposal to see the Imam. 7. In the light of the foregoing it is proposed that we should now take the following action:- (a) confirm to P.C.L. that the Company should give up their plans for exploration this winter, during which time investigations will be carried out on the lines suggested by the Political Resia^ntJ t-i/L H A* t* U, 9 tuJC) A -uewc, it ^ A** * ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ *4 * ^ /*&gt;7*sUj£y (b)/■MS Minute Paper.

S.H. Longrigg, Esq., Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., City-Gate House, FinsLury Square, E. C. 2. Copy to:- Admiralty Foreign Office Petroleum Dept. Air Ministry. 12 OCT ,-n i) I promised to v/rite to 3 r ou regarding the discussion on 29th September with you and Sir Trenchard Fowle on the subject of conditions in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and adjacent territories. ' fcj.'The co conclusion was that it would be in the interests of all concerned to adhere generally to the procedure suggested by the Political Resident and outlined in my letter of 31st August, that no atten{t should be made to explore the Trucial hinterland until more is known of the de facto position / and that the de facto tribal authorities i *n the hinterland should be approached through the de jure Rulers from whom the Company has or obtains concessions. Though this procedure involves some delay in conducting further exploration, it seems preferable to proceed gradually. You pointed out that your Company is definitely interested in exploring the possibilities of the areas of its concessions but thought * / that in the circumstances they would be willing to fall in v/ith the proposal to postpone any exploration work for the present. We are therefore instructingthe Acting Political Resident accordingly. The reasons which render it desirable to proceed with caution in the case of the Trucial hinterland apply Ji v/ith equal and perhaps greater force in the case of Muscat territory. The importance irS' recognised of obtaining the Sultan*s written consent before any attempt is made to begin exploratory work (either by land or sea) in any part of the territories controlled by His Highness. We understand that the Company does not propose to commence exploration in Muscat territories for the present but? v/ould like to interview the Sultan (either in India or at Muscat) to discuss oil questions and make preliminary enquiries as to the means of exploring the south-eastern coast, and we are taking steps to ascertain (by telegram) whether an interview with His Highness can be arranged. We are also consulting the local Political authorities on your suggestion that you might sound the Sultan as to the possibility of your meeting the Imam of Onan in regard to the question of exploration in the territories controlled by the Imam. ;h&lt; 1 hope to be able to send you a further communication in regard to these points very shortly. alnoapsfr- J (Btu) J, CL WALTnvPERSIAN GULF OIL . Mr. Longrigg called by appointment on the 29th September to discuss the question of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. exploring in the Trucial Coast hinterland, etc. Mr. V/alton, Sir Trenchard Powle and Mr. Symon were present at the interview. Mr. Longrigg explained that the Company’s geologists had covered most of the accessible parts of the territory concerned and that the Company now wished to push on with the exploration of the remaining areas. The exploration party would consist of Mr. T.P.Williamson and Mr. R.Pomeyrol, both of whom were permanently employed by the Company. The Company did not propose to engage any special staff for the work. Messrs. Williamson and Pomeyrol were proceedin': to the Gulf area forthwith and would be available if work could be found for them in the Trucial hinterland. An important reason for making a complete exploration was that the Company had definitely decided to commence boring operations in Qatar and that the extent of their operations in that area would, to some extent, depend on the reports of their geologists in respect of the other territories in which the Company were interested. ^ Machinery for the Qatar operations had already been ordered but at the moment the Company were reluctant to commence actual operations pending a decision regarding the Bahrein unallotted area^ the) Company feared that if oil v/as discovered in commercial qu ntities in Qatar before a decision was reached regarding the unallotted area they might find themselves obliged to considerably increase their present offer to the Sheikh of Bahrein/ Mr. Longrigg agreed that the proposed exploration was not a matter of vital urgency but, at the same time, he wished to avoid giving/PH 0 ' • '\ '—-s giving the impression that his Company were not interested in developing oil resources in all the territories for v/hich they had obtained, or hope to obtain, concessions. Mr. Lon ;rigg then went on to explain that there v/ere three areas in which his Company wished to pursue further explorations, viz: (a) Jebel Fayah and the country of the south and south-east thereof; country east and south of the Baraimi Oasis with Jebel Hafit, and to the south and south-east thereof; lyv\A^* £ (b) ihe areaj controlled by the Beni Bu Ali tribe; and (c) The south-east coast of Muscat as far as Dhofar. /fa. ibrki /itvtX ti / U c* tU+t+tr* t U++ [ft** t 1 ' /fcw* k u.l*+ The Company were not interested in the north-eastern coastal belt along by Sohar - Muscat - Ras-al-Had. Mr. Longrigg said that it had been the Company’s intention to undertake (a) during the coming v/inter and to deal with (b) and (c) during the winter of 1938-39. After a full discussion, during which the difficulties in the way of undertaking further exploration until more is ^ tt. known of the position were explained, Mr. Longrigg agreed that it might be best for the Company to give up all ideas of exploring in the Trucial hinterland during the coming winter. tZ tt' Hiir Ca**(/■*■*+ *7 H+* jytwiz*.

He asked that this suggestion should be considered* As regards the south-east coast of Muscat, Mr. Longrigg said that what his Company had in mind was to survey this area from the air. They had an idea to charter a steamer on which would be based an aeroplane or flying-boat. Mr. Walton INDIA h# expressed grave doubts as to the advisability of undertaking even an aerial survey unless the Sultan was prepared to guarantee the safety of the party. ^ Mr. Longrigg agreed and stated that thf^watf*. further reasorufor his wishing to discuss matters with the Sultan. OFFICE, 6th October, 1937.TWgM ' Ur. Svmon. Re our conversation. I am not in favour of Mr. Caroe's tentative suggestion that we should establish the A.P.A. and the Coy.'s party with centre at Baraimi for further exploration (vide t Bushire Tel: of 24th Sept; P.Z. 6341). It does not really develop the trial and error courses suggested in my letter to Capt: Hickinbotham No: C/158 of July 25th (para. 3 of Mr. Caroe^ Telegram) as my idea was that the Coy: should not send explaing parties to the Trucial Coast until the way had been prepared by the A.P.A. alone working with the Shaikh. This point is fully covered in Mr. Clauson^ Note of 25th Sept:, and I entirely agree with his views. 2. With regard to Mr. Longrigg's view expressed at A. in Mr. Clauson’s Note. The final result of this would be that we would have to recognise the petty rulers of the hinterland, and so would the Coy., thus involving them in a series of new and expensive concessions. 3. With regard to the Company’s explorations in Muscat territory (B. in Mr. Clauson’s Note) I doubt very much whether the Dhank-izki one would be a practical proposition, but we could find out from P.A. Muscat (through Mr. Caroe). 4. I suggest that following action might be taken by us:- (a) Point out to Mr. Longrigg as in C. of Mr. Clauson’s Note, and also explain A. (b) Ascertain from Mr. Longrigg two or three Trucial Coast hinterland areas which Company want to explore, and inform Mr. Caroe accordingly. Suggest to him that the ’’Concession” Shaikh (or Shaikhs) in whose territory these areas de jure lie should be informed of the Coy.’s intentions, and that the Shaikh (or Shaikhs) should be directed to inform the petty local Shaikh accordingly, and we can then see what the reaction of the local Shaikhs will be.(c) Ascertain which the Coy. wish to explore in Muscat territory, and find out from the Saltan throu^i Mr. Caroe to what extent he can guarantee safety in those areas.

Dated 27th August, 1937. Prom Captain T. Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain at Karachi. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter Ho.c/591- 22/4 dated the 28th July 1937 paragraphs 5 and 6 and to enclose a copy of a report dated August 23rd No. c/750-16/4 dated the 22nd August 1937 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah 2. By clause I of the Protectorate Treaties of 1892 the Trucial Shaikhs are debarred from entering ,l into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British Government”. It now transpires that all the Trucial Shaikhs have an agreement, probably unwritten regarding the apprehension and punishment of offenders from Saudi Arabia and that they have all at one time or another corresponded officially with the Saudi Arabian authorities. Therefore the Trucial Shaikhs have consistently failed to observe the restrictions imposed by their Treaties of 1892. 3o A reference to Bertram Thomas’ map of the Rub A1 Khali will show that the Awamir are well within the proposed limits of Trucial Oman and Oman, as contemplated by the Riyadh line, and that the Daru (Darau) are located in the neighbourhood of Ibri which for practical purposes may be described as 100 miles north east of point ”J n of the Riyadh line. It therefore appears that King Ibn Saud is extending his influence to the eastward, even as far as Baraimi4. We are confronted 'by two problems. That of ibn Saud's extension of his influence eastward and that ox the failure of the Trucial Shaikhs to comply strictly with the provisions of the Treaties of 1892. The first of these two problems I consider to be of the greater importance. 5 0 The fact of peaceful penetration into what has always been considered as Oman territory, I use the word Oman in a geographical rather than a Political sense, is sufficiently disturbing in itself, but when the potential oil developments inthe area in question are considered it becomes particularly significant and alarming. Even during the short period of time that I have been in contact with the oil interests in the Persian Gulf I could not fail to notice that the centre of interest, as far as future development is concerned, is just this very area of country. The drillers of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have, in my presence, spoken of their conviction that they are at present working in the wrong geological structure and that south east the conditions should be ideal. The representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited on the Trucial Coast have made no secret of the fact that they look on the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi and to the south and east as the most likely country. Their geologists have already made a preliminary survey and having done so are anxious to push on beyond Baraimi this year into the area in question. One of the recent Muscat Concessions has been granted for the 'Sultan's Arabian Territories'. A very wide term which would include any territory which it may be decided belongs to the Sultan in this area. These facts in themselves may not be of great significance but collectively they have led me to the conclusion/cj-3* 3 • Azi 3 . conclusion that those best qualified to know, believe that the Abu Dhabi-Baraimi-Ibri areas, and the area to the south west are the most likely to produce oil. I have little doubt that the Saudi Arabian authorities have come to the same conclusion and if they have not will soon be encouraged to do so, by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. This company has not been successful with their drilling up to date. They have entered into heavy financial commitments and so far have had no return vro rth mentioning. Naturally they are desirous of working in the most likely country. The Trucial Coast is closed to them and any prospect of obtaining a concession embracing this area through the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has practically ceased to exist. The grant of the Muscat Concessions to Petroleum Concessions Limited has closed that door to the area. However, although it may not be possible for them to operate in the territories of these Chiefs it is possible for them to operate in Saudi Arabian territory. Therefore if they are to operate in this area it is necessary for Saudi- Arabia to establish a claim. This the Saudi Arabian Government is in the process of doing. The question of the boundary between Oman, Trucial and otherwise, and Saudi Arabia has been pending for years. The Saudi Arabian authorities have not shown any desire to have the question settled expeditiously, in fact they have procrastinated and delayed in every possible way. In the meantime Ibn Saud’s influence has been increasing on the Oman borders. This increase of influence is in my opinion by design and not by accident. The longer we delay a settlement of the boundary question the worse will be our position. Ibn Saud will push his territorial claims north and east, well beyond the limits of the present Riyadh line, and/and in reply to our protests will point out that not only does he claim the area but that the inhabitants ohemselves acknov/ledge him as their overlord. Any investigation that we like to make will only prove the truth of his statement. The longer we delay the stronger will his influence be on the borders of Oman. 6. It is high time that we took a strong line with Ibn Saud and there is no time like the present. His supremacy in Saudi Arabia is said to d epend to a certain extent on his ability to produce funds when required. His financial position I understand is none too strong and he looks to the British Government to assist him. We have been for ever worrying about the effect of our actions on other Muslim peoples and countries. In fact we have become so nervous of causing comment that we have done nothing and the only result that has been achieved is a loss of prestige in the aforesaid countries. A strong and determined policy with regard to Ibn Saud and the boundary question will have repercussions and very desirable repercussions too. Our influence and prestige will rise not only on this side of Arabia but all over Arabia. Publicity will be given to our actions and our intentions will be misconstrued by those to whose advantage it is to misconstrue them, but as anti-British propaganda is being disseminated daily by the less reputable of the vernacular newspapers and wireless broadcasting stations I do not see that our interests will be injured to any greater extent should we decide to take a firm line in Arabia than they are being at present. 7 0 I advocate a policy of firmness in diplomatic relations with Ibn Saud regarding problems affecting the Trucial Shaikhs and in particular the settlement of the boundary/■■■■ 5. boundary question on the basis of the Riyadh line. This question has been pending for years, as I have already said, and every endeavour should be made to arrive at a settlement this winter. I heard a rumour a short time ago to the effect that His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Jedda was proposing that the suggested Q,atar Boundary Commission should not be assembled this year and that the whole question should be postponed. I am opposed to any such suggestion and consider that not only should the Boundary Commission meet but that in addition as much of the frontier between Oman and Saudi Arabia as possible should be determined. If an early start is made and a firm policy adopted it should be possible to settle the whole of this vexed question by the end of the spring. 8. At the same time as we are bringing diplomatic pressure to bear on Ibn Saud with regard to the boundary we must not neglect affairs on the Trucial Coast. We must take measures to increase our knowledge of and influence in the country. I have already written at length on this subject in my letter No.C/539-25/4 dated the 10th July 1937 and will not trouble you by going over the ground again. It is essential that this cold weather we make a determined effort to open up the country and I suggest that as a preliminary we cannot do better than to follow in the footsteps of Sir Percy Cox. I would propose that a Political Officer accompanied by the Air Liaison Officer Bahrain and the Residency Agent should visit Baraimi and from there proceed to Ibri and possibly from there, with the cooperation of the Political Agent, Muscat, continue into Muscat territory. They would get in touch with the people and the leaders of the people. I will not attempt to define in this letter the aims and objects/6 . objects that should control the movements and conduct of the party but I suggest now that the leader of the party should be empowered to discuss potential political agreements with independent tribal leaders. It would be of great advantage if the party was accompanied by an officer skilled in mapping or surveying, and I suggest that the party should be prepared to leave Abu Dhabi by the middle of November. However if my views are favourably considered there will be time enough for the Political Officer who leads the party to go into details of time and space. I am only concerned in this letter with the general principle. 9. The second problem is really part of the first and is the direct result of our neglect of conditions in this part of Arabia. I am not concerned with the reasons for this neglect but with the results and the neutralising of the ill effects. We have two courses open to us and they are: - (a) to call the Shaikhs to account for their breaches of their treaty obligations and warn them that any continuance of the present practices will not be countenanced or (b) to take no direct action but by increasing our influence and supporting the Trucial Shaikhs remove the cause of the trouble which is fear of Saudi Arabia. I do not consider the first course advisable as it will involve us in an infinity of trouble. Should the Trucial Shaikhs in answer to our protests desist from sending Saudi Arabian offenders to Saudi Arabia for punishment, raids are almost certain to take place in addition to protests from Ion Saud. The protests will no doubt be susceptible to diplomatic treatment but the raids will not. The Shaikhs will quite rightly point out that they are being raided because they have, by their acceding to our wishes, annoyed Ibn Saud and we shall thereupon/thereupon he called upon to decide how far we are committed to take action to defend those in treaty relation with us who suffer from outside interference as a direct result of their strict observation, at our request, of their treaty obligations. I have no doubt that we shall lodge a diplomatic protest but more obvious action will be necessary in addition if we are to maintain our prestige with the tribes. I agree with the Residency Agent and have no wish to advocate action likely to precipitate a crisis. Rather I advise, as he has done, the second course of action. Increase of influence by personal contact and the strengthening and supporting of the border states until they are able to stand alone against Saudi Arabia. An increase of our influence here will mean an increase of our influence in Saudi Arabia and a decrease of the Saudi Arabian influence in Oman and the Trucial Coast. A very desirable objective. 10. Lest it be construed that I advocate a general policy of restraint and conciliation in our dealings with the Trucial Shaikhs I wish to make it quite clear that nothing is further from my intention. Too much restraint is misinterpreted by the Shaikhs as fear. Our Policy on the Trucial Coast must be one of firmness, fairness and kindness. The order is intentional. Pirmness is the most important and most understood and appreciated by the leaders and people. Fairness is understood and appreciated but cannot stand alone as firmness can. Kindness is the medium by which friendships are formed between the peoples and the rulers and the political authorities. I have, etc., (Sgd.) T. Hickinbotham. Captain, Political Agent, Bahrain at Karachi.Copy of memorandum No. C/750-16/4 dated 22nd August 1937 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah to the Political Agent, Bahrain at Karachi. Reference your memorandum No.C/595-22/4 dated 29th July 1937. 2. When King Bin Saud became powerful the Trucial Shaikhs started sending him presents and also to the Amir of Hasa with the object of gaining his favour and preventing raids by the Ajman, A1 Murrah, Bani Hajir and Manasir tribes. Since 1930 King Bin Saud extended his influence to Dhafrah (Abu Dhabi) and to Buraimi where the Darau and some of the Awamir tribes became his subjects. As the Trucial Shaikhs were weak and could not prevent outside raids, they were compelled by circumstances to complain to the Saudi Arabian authorities against their subjects and in all cases the punishment was satisfactory and much more than what they would have inflicted against the offenders. In order that they may not offend the Saudi authorities they never punish offenders caught by them on the Trucial Coast but send them to the Amir of Hasa for punishment. Trucial subjects (offenders) do not run away to Saudi Arabia which is not safe for them. If Trucial Coast offender runs away to Saudi Arabia he is punished and not returned. 3. Without the aid of the Amir of Hasa, the Trucial Shaikhs will not be able to stop raids by subjects of Saudi Arabia and, in my opinion, it is more to their advantage that they should be left to continue the present practice until such time as they can stand on their feet without the aid of others To prevent them from dealing or sending offenders for punishment by Saudi Arabia would mean offending Saudi authorities/mam ■■■■■I authorities who will no doubt instigate their subjects and encourage them to raid the Trucial Coast, The Shaikhs would then ask our help against Saudi Arabian subjects and tnus create a very difficult position for us as wevould not be able to check their intrigues. 4. All the Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast complain to Saudi authorities but more cases occur in the Sheikhdoms of Abu Dhabi and Dubai as they are closer and more frequented by Manasir subjects of Saudi Arabia.Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf r\ No. C/277 Camp, Ghiraz, Dated the 29th September, 1937 Will you please refer to your letter No.T/102-22/4, dated 27th August 1937, on the subject of Saudi penetration of Trucial Oman ? 2. You will see that Mr. Caroe has referred to Saudi activities in the hinterland of Oman in paragraph 4 (ii) of his telegram No.T/216, dated the 24th September 1937, and thinks your letter serves as a very useful reminder of the difficulties likely to be encountered in any effort to penetrate to the hinterland of the Trucial Coast. 3. As regards your proposals for boundary delimitation, and generally for taking a stiffen line with Ibn Saud, it must be borne in mind that the friendship and stability of Saudi Arabia is one of the main objects of general policy in the present situation in the Middle East. It is moreover now clear that Ibn Saud is not at this juncture ready to settle his boundaries, and the whole question is consequently in suspense except as regards a special area, (cf. correspondence ending with Foreign Office telegram No. 58, dated the 1st July 1937, to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, copy forwarded to you under Residency Printed Letter No. 512-S, dated 3rd July 1937). On both these grounds, therefore, Mr. Caroe feels that the wider implications of the course advocated in your letter are hardly in the sphere of practical politics. Yours sincerely, Sgd. A.C. Galloway Captain T. Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain.— —P.Z. 6341/37 Mr. Symon . As I understand it Mr. Caroe suggests that it might he possible to consider the establishment of the A.P.A. (Mr. Galloway) this Autumn at Baraimi, which he would make his headquarters for further investigations into the inter-Trucial and Trucial-Muscat boundaries, in company with P.C.L. f s geological party consisting of Mr- T.P. Williamson(a different person from Haji Williamson, who of course is not a geologist) and M. Pomeyrol. The geological party would apparently be used as a stalking horse by the A.P.A., and the presence of the party under official auspices would, in Mr. Caroe^ view, 'bring the question of jurisdiction to a head’* by making the Trucial Sheikhs and the Sultan face up to the fact that they must settle their de jure boundaries and must somehow establish their de facto control up to these de jure boundaries, in order that they may get the best out of their respective oil concessions (whether actual or prospective). The first thing to do, I should think, is to get Sir T. Fowle’s views on this idea - a tentative one, evidently - of Mr. Caroe’s (or Captain Hickinbotham*s or Mr. Galloway’s ?). He may feel that this would be pressing on too fast, and that it is best to stick to the present scheme whereby the A.P.A., on his own, should spend the cold weather in a thorough and unhurried sifting-out of the various boundary problems which have been brought into the open by the preliminary investigations of the Residency Agent (see enclosures to Mr. Caroe’s letter of the 27th August - P. Z.6237/37). In parenthesis - and this is a purely personal hypothesis - I wonder whether Mr. Galloway, being unfamiliar I take it with the Trucial Coast, is not unwilling to have the assistance of people who have more actual experience of the/s /-\ ^in small envelope. ^enclosure toP.Z.6237/ 37 4# 2 . the neighbourhood, and whether this may have something to do with Mr. Caroe’s suggestion. /Of course 3-handed bridge might be possible too^7 If, however. Sir T. Powle thinks the idea is one which should be pursued, the next step, I should say, could be to discuss the whole question with Mr. Longrigg without prejudice , and on the clear understanding that we should have to consult the Foreign Office on the outcome of the discussion, and also our higher authorities who have taken an interest. I should say there was quite a possibility that the Company might not like the idea of sending a party out at all if they were merely to sit at Baraimi (which I gather they have already surveyed last cold weather) and take the chance of getting further. In particular I should say that they (the Company) would want to be sure that they (the party) could get at the Jebel Faiyah before they (the Company) send them (the party) out. Now it seems to me from Captain Hickinbotham*s map* and report^ that there has been no advance whatever, as yet, in respect of the Shargah hinterland. Last year the geological party stuck (as Mr. Longrigg says in his letter of 1st September - P.Z.5803/37) precisely at this point. They got to Baraimi, but on striking north (at least I suppose that is what happened) they found that they could not get to the Jebel Faiyah area, the place where they really expect oil, because the Sheikh of Shargah, in whose territory de .lure the area is, cannot control the local tribes. Captain Hickinbotham says in his report that 'at present his effective control only extends as far as his gardens beyond the aerodrome. He may be capable of bribing those in de facto control to acknowledge his overlordship, but I am a little doubtful. He would not at present be able to go as far as Dhaid without spending a considerable sum in presen ts M « Dhaid/Seven + ^atar 1) Abu Dhabi 2) Dibei 3) Sharjah 4) Ajman t 5) Umm al A Qawain / 6) Ras al Khaimah 7) Kalba 3. (Dhaid is marked on the blue map, it is north of the Jebel Paiyah but about equidistant with it from Shargah - however it looks more accessible, and Captain Hickinbotham 1 s remarks may apply with even greater force to the Jebel Paiyah). It looks therefore on the face of it as if the geological party might find itself kicking its heels at Baraimi while the Sheikh of Shargah was trying to get his de .lure subordinates into de facto complaisance. What they (the Company) would like to do (and what they originally suggested) is to go their own way, disregarding the Sheikh of Shargah, and making contacts with the de facto tribal leaders as they meet them. Mr. Longrigg has expressed the view to me that we are wrong in regarding the Trucial Sheikhs as being only T* in number, and that eventually we shall have to get into direct relations with more petty rulers in the hinterland. If the Company^ geological party goes about buying its way and entering into direct relations with the local tribal leaders, it may well end in our having to do so too. Thus it seems to me that we are faced with a dilemma, assuming the geological party goes out, and assuming it is the Jebel Paiyah area that it particularly wishes to explore. Either they and the A.?.A. will wait for the Sheikh of Shargah to bring his locals up to scratch, in which case they will wait till next summer kicking their heels, or they will pay their own way with the locals, in which case we shall eventually be faced with a new crop of Trucial Sheikhs springing up in the hinterland and subsidized by the Company. It may therefore be best for the party not to go at alii There is, however, a possibility, I think, of compromise. Mr. Longrigg, when last he reminded me of the promised interview/4 I interview with Sir T, Powle on this, said he hoped to extend the discussion to cover the possibility of geological exploration in the other direction, i*e« South-East from Baraimi, in Muscat territory, along the South Western slopes of the mountain range parallel to, and to the South West of, the Gulf of Oman (see the Saudi-Arabian Boundaries map, in long envelope attached), I take it Mr. Longrigg is speaking of the area including e.g. Dhank, f Ibra, Bahlah, Nizv/a, Izki, and on down towards the Beni Bu f Abi territory. He also spoke of the Southern Coast, but I think they will want to do some or most of that with aeroplanes later on. (They are not interested in the North Eastern Coastal belt along by Sohar - Muscat - Ras-al-Hadd). I do not know whether it is practical politics for them to attempt exploration in this area, which of course is Oman proper and under the quasi-independent Imam. Sir T. Fowle will of course be able to advise on this: the question is whether the Sultan, who has given the Company an oil concession covering all this territory, can deliver the goods and authorise them to explore (guaranteeing their safety). There is of course the saving clause in the x Article 17, Concession about certain areas being unsafe at present, and Copy attached. (if the political agreement goes through in its draft form) it is for the Political Resident in the last resort to say whether the areas really are safe or not. But .if it would be possible for the Company’s geological party to explore in the Muscat (Oman) area, then the Jebel Paiyah question could be left over until next year and at the same time the Company’s expensive geological party could be employed. 1 Perhaps the solution to be aimed at with Mr. Longrigg would be to agree that the Trucial Hinterland must be/be left over until next year, so far as the Company is concerned, but that the Sultan might be asked whether they might explore in Oman (on the S.W. slopes of the Hajar Range) - unless Sir T. Powle thinks that that is prima facie an impossible proposition, in which case the geological party would have to be put off altogether. If the party goes out at all in that part of the world, they would of course have to keep very well outside the Red Line of Ibn Saud*s boundary claim (see the map in the long envelope). It will be seen that Baraimi and all the Omani mountain slopes are a long way from the Red Line - i.e. a long way from any territory which Ibn Saud himself claims for himself. So that aspect of the question - viz. the fear of any entanglement with Ibn Saud - may be disregarded, I imagine. As regards the Foreign Office, if the geological party is off, they obviously need only be informed. If there is any idea of exploration being actually carried out, in the Trucial Hinterland or more particularly in the Oman area, they should I suppose be consulted on the basis of the telegrams, the correspondence with P. C.L.,and the note of the forthcoming interview with Mr. Longrigg. I should myself feel it doubtful whether it would be worth asking them to attend the discussion with Mr. Longrigg as I think it is for us to keep in touch with the Company and to give a lead to the other departments. If there were any real question of trouble with Ibn Saud, it might be another matter. Meanwhile you will no doubt circulate Mr. Caroe f s letter of 27th August and his telegram of the 24th September/September to the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. T/125 dated July 27th 1937 and to enclose reports dated the 4th of August and 11th of August together with sundry papers from the Kesidency Agent Sharjah. 2. I have drawn a sketch map of the peninsula and have marked in as far as possible such of the places mentioned by the Kesidency Agent Sharjah as I have been able to identify with the aid of Volume II Geographical of Lorimer f s 'Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf'. While by no means accurate this sketch map is more accurate than 'Arabia and the Persian Gulf' 1916 1 inch = 32 miles and the map attached to Lorimer f s 'Gazetter' 1 inch = 32 miles as I have been careful to copy the Admiralty chart for the coast line and place the villages by cross bearings and distances from the descriptions given in the letter press of Lorimer Volume II. For instance Samaih in Abu Dhabi territory is correctly shown as being south of Has Ghunadhah and not slightly north as is the case in most maps. The hills are very inaccurate and they have been put in merely to indicate high ground and not the formation and / extent ofextent of the jhigh ground. I have coloured the areas claimed by the individual Shaikhs for ease of identification^ 5. I have one or two comments to make on the claims of the various Shaikhs* Has al Khaimah . He is claiming an area which includes territory which he has himself told me belongs to Kalba i.e. he is claiming the whole of the Wadi al Qor the greater part of which he stated in Bahrain belonged to Kalba. I suspect that he has also encroached on the Sultanate of Muscat and the Shaikhdom of Sharjah. The Beni Kitab are the de facto rulers of a considerable fraction of the territory claimed by this Shaikh. Umn al Qai wain . This is an accurate statement of his territory and he controls the whole of it. Ajman . This is an accurate description of this Shaikhs area. He controls the whole area. Sharjah . I am not surprised at the Shaikh refusing to state what area he claims. There is no doubt that a very large area belongs de .jure to this Shaikh but at the same time it is equally certain that he is unable to control one tenth of his area. At present his effective control only extends as far as his gardens beyond the aerodrome. He -/ may be i £may be capable of bribing those in de facto control to acknowledge his overlordship but I am a little doubtful* He would not at present be able to go as iar as Dhaid without spending a considerable sum in presents. Dubai * He is claiming very much more than he is entitled to in a southerly direction. There has been a boundary dispute in progress for some time between Dubai and Abu Dhabi regarding the southern boundary of Dubai and the matter was submitted to arbitration. BinHillal of Buraimi a well known and highly respected Shaikh who was with Sir P.Z. Cox in 1905 on his expedition to Ibri and Buraimi, was appointed arbitrator. In June the arbitrator had succeeded in narrowing the area in dispute to a strip of barren territory, not far south of Jebel Ali. The actual line has not yet been agreed upon as the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was being very obstinate. The arbitrator who is over eighty and who I met in Dubai in June told me he was going to Abu Dhabi to put the Shaikh of Dubai* s case as he was convinced that the Shaikh of Dubai was making a reasonable request. I asked him if he hoped to be able to bring about a settle- ment and he said that he would do all he could tp persuade the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to come to a settlement but he was doubtful of the result. He described the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi as n an obstinate bedu w and said that if he would not listen to reason then as far as he was concerned he could n go to hell 1 *. Shaikh Said bin Maktum can and does control I the area claimed by him. -/ Abu DhabiAbu Dhabi # I have not had the time to check the Hesidency Agent’s report but I will do so and compare the Shaik 1 s present claims with those put forward when Colonel Gordon Loch caeried out his investigations in Qatar-Saudia Arabia boundary question in 1935* The present claims in the north extend into what the Shaikh of Dubai considers as his territory • In my opinion the present northern claim of Abu Dhabi is correct but Jebel Ali should be included in Dubai and not in Abu Dhabi territory. In the west the claim is too ambitious. It now includes the whole of the Buraimi oasis. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has never previously claimed more than seven of the villages of this oasis. The Naim who claim to be independent of Muscat and Abu Dhabi occupy some of the Buraimi villages. 4. I am not in possession of the facts and events on which the Shaikhs base their claims but I am endeavouring to obtain them and will forward them as soon as possible. I have the honour to be.

Here our party found the tribesmen quite un willing to accept the advice or orders of the Shaikh of Sharjah, as the latter was forced to confess. If we wait until the Shaikh of Sharjah ( or other Trucial Ruler) feels disposed to part with money in order to buy the Company a right of entrance into the hinterland, or until such Ruler and a Shaikh of the Interior agree on an oil Convention between themselves, it seems likely that we should wait a long time. Almost all areas in which there are ( in the words of Paragraph 4 of your letter ) neither de jure nor de facto difficulties were visited by cur party last season, and we had hoped to recommence work, from some date late in October, in the areas to which we were then not able to li'lktain acci ENOLOemtE IN WE 36 9rSEP FllCirt §SQR , POLi i&gt;T.

INDIA OFFICE i on which subject we have now received the views of the Political Resident in COPY SENT TO y r* 5973 5000 3.37 2. There appears to be little doubt that, all the territory which your Company now wishes to explore belongs _de jure either to one of the Trucial Sheikhs (from practically all of whom the Company has obtained options or concessions) or to the Sultan of Muscat. We fear, however, that if any attempt is made to explore the territory in question before more is known of the _de facto position, the Company will (apart from other difficulties) find themselves put to considerable expense since the prospect of oil being discovered might make some of the numerous petty de facto Sheikhs open their mouths rather wide. The Political Resident has therefore suggested that as a first step the local Political Authorities/ j:kAuthorities should ascertain from the Rulers concerned what part of the hinterland is claimed hy them respectively, together with the grounds for their claims. This first step should not take long (it is already well advanced) and when this has been done a provisional ruling can be given as to the de jure position in any case in which the claims of two Rulers conflict. 3. The final step would be to discover how much territory the Rulers concerned effectively control, and in the Resident’s view this can best be ascertained by test cases. He has accordingly suggested that some area to which your Company wish to send an exploration party should be chosen for the purpose and that the Ruler in whose territory the selected area is situated should then, in his capacity of overlord, address the petty de facto Sheikh concerned to the effect that an exploration party was visiting it. Should the Sheikh raise no objections all would be well, but if difficulties were encountered it would be for the Ruler to bring the Sheikh round. Prom the Ruler’s point of view, it would be decidedly to his advantage to have the selected area explored, and this object might be achieved byoffering a to the Sheikh in the shape of a substantial present from/Vi Draft Paper. Department. from the money received from the Company or by the promise of a percentage of the royalties if oil is subsequently found in the area. 4. We recognise, of course, that the above procedure wiil involve some alteration in the Company*s Autumn plans, but in the opinion of Sir Trenchard Fowle it is the best in the circumstances. I should add that we see no reason why the Company should not start work in the near future in any areas in which the de jure position is not in dispute and in which no difficulty is likely to arise in regard to the _de facto position. 5. Sir Trenchard .Fowle will be working at the India Office from the 20th September and the opportunity might then be taken of talking the matter over with him. Tours sincerely. fMO J. 0.

As I see it, when Shaikh X, the de facto petty Shaikh of the Y area, is appro* ed by the Company to allow an exploration party to enter his area in return for a cash present, he will think to himself that if he agrees he will thereby surrender his rights to oil in the Y area. Before giving permission therefore he will, I imagine, want a separate concession from the Company. As there are presumably many such petty Shaikhs in the hinterland, this will involve the Company in a series of expensive concessions, and their position would become impossible. 2. There is, I think, however, little doubt that all the territory which the Company wish to explore belongs de .jure either to some Trucial Shaikh or to the Muscat State, with % both of which parties the Company has concessions. The oil rights of the petty de facto Shaikhs would therefore not arise. Doubtless some of the claims of the Trucial Shaikhs will clash -/will clash Captain T. Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain.will clash as between themselves and as between one or more of them and Muscat, Baraimi, to which the Sultan lays claim, but they need not be gone^ into for the moment* % It seems to me therefore that the first step is for you and Watts to work out respectively from the Trucial Cftast Shaikhs, and from the Sultan, what part of the hinter- land is claimed by them respectiveXy, Y/itj!i the grounds for their claims* This first step ought not to take very long as it is merely a case of the parties concerned putting up their claims, and does not involve any inspection of the areas nor, at this stage, of reconciling rival claims* 4 * Ike next step would be to test how much area the Trucial Coast Shaikhs effectively control. It seems to me that no amount of examination can clear up this point, which can only be ascertained by test cases. I think therefore that some are$, Y, to which the Company wish to send an exploration party should be chosen. The Trucial Shaikh in whose territory Y was situated would in his capacity of overlord address the pet uy Shaikh, X, to the effect that an exploration party was visiting it* Should X make no difficulties well and good* If not, it would be up to the Trucial Coast Shaikh either by force, bribery, or diplomacy, or all combined, to bring X round* From the Shaikh's point of view it would be decidedly to his advantage to have Y area explored, and he could bribe Shaikh X by offering him either a substantial present from the money lie had received from the Company, or by promising him a percentage j of the royalties if oil were subsequently found in Y area* 5* The above procedure may seem somewhat tortuous, and wi. X ofcourse take time, but I think it is the best in the circumstances, and until we know how things from the de facto -/ de facto■MM -5- de facto point of view stand in the hinterland it would be better for the Company not to send their parties out to the Trucial Coast, where they would be simply held up, wasting theifc time.

CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON • E.C.2 11th June, 1937- Dear Mr. Walton, V As agreed between us yesterday afternoon- the 10th instant, I am sending you a short note con taining such information as we have on conditions in the hinterland south and south-east of the Trucial Coast. It would appear from this that certain areas which might possibly contain conditions favourable for oil are outside the effective control of the Trucial Coast rulers, with whom we are already in touch and from whom we hope to obtain concessions. The question which therefore arises - that is, with whom we ought to deal in such cases, and with whom you are willing that we should deal - is one which we cannot long delay facing, and this for two reasons: firstly the extent of their effectively controlled hinterland eventually affects the value of concessions which the Trucial shaikhs may grant us: and secondly, our field programme in that area for next cold weather must depend upon the extent to which we can hope for access to the inlying areas. Enel. Yours sincerely, /jf^C—- J.C. Walton Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1. P.S. x I am sending a copy of this letter and note to Mr. Rendel of the Foreign Office.(2? NOTE ON CONDITIONS IN THE HINTERLAND SOUTH AND SOUTH-EAST OF THE TRUCIAL COAST L P.C.L. Geologists who worked on the Trucial Uoast, generally based on Dubai, during the cold weather of 1936 / 37 ., report that not the least interesting area is likely to lie immediately to the west of the Oman mountain range, running south-east to north-west and south to north. The area concerned thus includes presumably the inlying portions of the territory under the real or nominal con trol of the Trucial Coast rulers. The Company is, however, without information as to the distance inland covered by the effective authority of these rulers, as well as their boundaries inter se and the extent to which nomadic or shepherd tribes in the interior are to be regarded as their subjects. In respect of the area under particular reference - that is, the crescent west of the Oman ranges - there appear to be other possible claimants to power. These are, firstly, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman himself, doubtful as it may be how far his authority extends westwards of the mountains: secondly, the Imam of Oman (understood to be in some sort of relations with Ibn Saud) whose statusappears to be quite independent of the Sultan of Muscat: thirdly, the inlying tribes themselves, and in particular the Beni Chittib (who seem to control the Jebel Faiyah area and to owe no real allegiance to the Shaikh of Sharjah, who claims them), the Beni Cha T ab (possibly controlled to some extent by Ras-al-Khaimah), the Na T um (who occupy Baraimi&amp; Jebel al Aouha), the Abu Shems (occupying Jebel Hafit and part of the Baraimi Oasis.J The Company ! s position is that it is anxious to send its Geologists to explore this country and, in fact, as much of the Trucial and Oman hinterland as possible. The Company*s Geologists believe that there are no insuperable physical difficulties in the way of such exploration, which they would probably be able to carry out with the help of good guides and perhaps fairly generous presents to the de facto rulers It is clear, however, that such movements would require the concurrence of the Political Resident in the Persian Gialf. From the Company’s point of view the step most desired would be a comprehensive definition of boundaries and authorities in the area concerned: or, failing this, per mission to make its own arrangements for further exploration.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000195_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3837</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000195</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3837</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/110(3) 'Trucial Coast Oil Concessions: Hinterland Exploration and Survey.
