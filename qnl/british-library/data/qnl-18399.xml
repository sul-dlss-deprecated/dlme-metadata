In the letter, John Patterson Porter forwards an extract, dated 24 August 1850, from Lieutenant Frederick Erskine Manners's report of his trip to Katiff [Al-Qaṭīf] and his efforts to recover stolen items from the Sheik there. Porter reports that Manners did not receive the copy of Samuel Hennell's letter of 19 August 1850 and suggests that Manners should return to Katiff to carry out the instructions contained in that letter. Porter estimates that the
                           Tigriswith her boats will have sufficient force to recover even more than the equivalent to the articles lost, adding that Manners has informed him that he managed to get his vessel within gun shot range of the fort. The extract follows the letter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711592.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
