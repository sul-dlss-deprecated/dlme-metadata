Memorandum C.219. The Seistan Mission 1872, (Mem. C.28 Major-General Sir F. Goldamid, on being appointed p.51) Arbitrator, left England on the 10th November 1871, with instructions to ascertain the status quo of Seietan; to meet • the Persian and Afghan Comraissioners at some pre-arranged point to acquire all the local information in his power; and after hearing the respective claims of the Commissioners to proceed to Tehran with a view to the discussion of the question and the delivery of an arbitral opinion. General Goldsmid met the Persian Commissioner at Banu on 7th January 1872. The Afghan Commissioner arrived in Seistan on the 8th May 1872, but all attempts to bring the Persian and Afghan Commissioners together proved fruitless. On March 11th 1872, the Mission left for Mashed and Tehran, arriving at the latter place on 4th June. Here the Persian statement of claim was received, on 10th July,four months after that of the Afghan Commissioner. General Goldsmid brought the Commissioners together at Tehran on three different occasions, on the last of which - 19th August 1872 - he delivered his arbitral opinion, and defined the boundary line, from Koh Siah on the north-west to Koh Malek Siah on the south of Seistan. The Persian Commissioner protested formally against the award, and the Afghan Commissioner stated that he could not accept the decision. The Persian Commissioner added that jtersia reserved her rights over the whole of Seistan. General Goldsmid understood that the word ’’proteat” meant an appeal to the English Foreign Office. At/t V From Foreign Office 30th. Sept. 1872. From Foreign Office 2nd Dec. 1872. Telegram from Viceroy 25th Nov. 1872. H.C.Vol.72 p.821. At a subsequent interview with the Persian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, General Goldsmid furnished explanations in consequence of which he formed the opinion that they were really inclined to accept the arbitration. On the 25th September, however, the Persian Minister, in a letter to Earl Granville, stated his Governments intention to leave the decision of the Seistan boundary question to His Majesty*s Government, and he requested that meanwhile the status quo might be observed. A long despatch dated 29th September from the Persian Government was transmitted to the Foreign Office by the Persian Minister on 27th November. It was contended that the pax*tition of Seistan was contrary to the rights of Persia, and was practically impossible. The portion transferred to Afghanistan was inhabited by semi-barbarous Baluchis, who would prove a permanent cause of trouble, as the .Afghanswould do nothing to control them. A rectification of the frontier was demanded, Persia claiming the Naizar and the country south of the Helmund as far as Rudbar. The Foreign Office in transmitting these papers to the India Office, requested the opinion of the Secretary of State as to the answer to be returned. Meanwhile the formal appeal of the Afghan Commissioner was received by the Viceroy, who requested that a final decision should be suspended till it had been considered. The views of the Government of India on the Arbitration award were communicated to the Foreign Office on 19th February 1873, and at the same time the Secretai'y of State expressed his opinion that the Goldsmid line was consistent with the existing circumstances, and would be just to both parties. He suggested that Earl Granville might give his final decision as arbitrator in accordance with these views. On/Fronr Foreign Office 4th March 1873. From Foreign Office 5th March 1873. From Foreign Office 16th July 1873. On 28th February Earl Granville spoke to the Persian Minister on the subject, and indicated the intention of His Majesty's Government to uphold the Goldsmid award. The Minister expressed great regret and surprise, and suggested that his Government would not accept the decision and n would probably try some other arbitration”. The reply to the Persian Minister was sent on 4th March. It stated that Lord Granville, having carefully examined the award and fully considered the observet ions of the Persian Government, and having communicated with the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, and with his colleagues, had come to the conclusion that the Goldsmid award was fair and just to both parties and could not be set aside. The Persian Government having appealed to His Majesty's Government, it was his duty to say that His Majesty's Government accepted that award in its entirety. On visiting England in the spring of 1873, the Shah endeavoured to induce His Majesty's Government to modify the above decision, but without success. The award was formally and fully accepted on behalf of the Shah by a note from the Sadr Azam of 16th July 1873.—</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001bf_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C219</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001bf</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C219</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'The Seistan Mission 1872.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1872/1872</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-06-08T22:51:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (6 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 6; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists of one handwritten and one typescript copy of a memorandum written in the India Office Political Department, in which the author describes the resolution, through British arbitration, of a dispute between the Governments of Persia and Afghanistan relating to the allocation of the Perso-Afghan boundary in Seistan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arbitration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001bf#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
