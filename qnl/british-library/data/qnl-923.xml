Kemball describes his meeting with Mubarak, and the conservation they had regarding Sheikh Muhammed's response to Kemball's offer to mediate between him and his exiled relatives (ff 32-34). Kemball also reports on a meeting between Sheikh Mubarak and Yusuf ben Ibraheem [Yusuf bin Ibrahim], the émigré Bahraini merchant residing in Bushire. There is an enclosure with Kemball's letter, the translated substance of a letter (f 43) sent to Kemball by the British agent in Bahrain, Hajee Jassim, dated 6 June 1852. In the letter, Jassim writes that after the consultation between Sheikh Muhammed bin Khalifa and his brother Sheikh Ali, Sheikh Mubarak bin Khalifa was appointed to travel to Bushire to hold talks with the Resident. Jassim states that the Sheikh Mubarak has no power, and his despatch to Bushire is merely to 'save appearances' with the British authorities.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
