Mr. Montagu notes that the sum of Krs. 200,604. 25 forms part of a sum in regard to which a claim has been lodged with thepersian Government, but he is of opinion that, in view of the extreme unlikeliness of this claim ever being met by that Government, there is no practical objection to the sum in question being regarded as at the disposal of His Majesty’s Government.

At the time of making application to His Majesty’s Government for these later advances Glr Percy Cox was careful to point out that they would have to be considered for the most part as a subsidy rather than as recoverable advances. The statement submitted shows that a sum of Brans 263,425 might now bo aided to the claim already lodged with the Persian Government of Brans 3,930,472, 50 but as Barman Forma refuses to produce vouchers for these new items, it is probable that the Persian Government will refuse to acknowledge liability for them. Moreover it is to be noted that the claim lodged with the Persian Govern ent for Brans 3,930 ,472.50 included an item of hr ana 1,500,000, advances for Gendarmerie purposes for which Colonel Gough had not been able to obtain accounts from the Gouth Persia Hifles. K0 SO &lt; I 1aecotnits have lot jt t an made out by Rifles, but it g'opears that there is en unexpended balance of brans 200,604, 25 in the hands of ’T. 1.^’s Consul at Shiraz, which will have to be deducted from the claim. f \s the details of this claim of Kran s 3,C50 ,4-cp, 50 have not jet been called for by the Persian C-overrment, T do not propose at present either to intimate to them the additional claim for brans 263,425, nor the reduction due to them of Krans 800,604, 25, but to leave these ooints in abeyance for consideration when tho whol^ quasi ion comes up for settlement.

The advances to the Governor-General of Fars, Ts. 243,047:2:50 consist of expenditure sanctioned by the Persian Government or accepted by Prince Parman Farrna as expenditure which the Persian Government ought to sanction. The receipts taken by the Governor-General 1 s administration for these payments are attached to the statement received from Colonel Gou$u Copies of the notes which passed between oir Charles marling and the I ersian Government, establishing the condi tions of repayaient of advances I. md 11 f were sent to you in Despatches No. 86 of July 18, 1916, and Ho. 125 of October 10, 1916. Advance No. IV, on the same conditions, was intimated to the Persian Government in bir Charles marling* s Note to Vossoughed Dov/leh dated Pay 27th, 1917, of which I now enclose a copy. No specific intimation was given in regard to subsequent advances, on account of the dubious attitude of the Governments then in office towards our policy in Fars. The question of how far these claims can be pressed on the i ersian Government is referred to in ulv Charles Larling* s uimarling* s telegrams i.o. 401 of June 19, 1916, No. 335 of October 9tii, 1917, and 40 of January 15, 1918. As the oifficultles therein foreseen may not arise v/ith the present Cabinet under the leadership of Vossough ed Dowleh, who was ali&gt;G Premier at the time the earlier advances were sanction* ed by the Persian Government, I propose to present now to the Persian Government the claim of Ts. 393,047:2:50 and to point out that it is legitimately dischargeable out of the current monthly advances * not in the expectation that the Government will agree to allocate part of these latter for that purpose, but that it will agree to certify the claim and relegate it to the position of an admitted item for ^ ultimate settlement along with the current advances. The payments to Prince Farraan Farma of Ts. 221,657:0:65 are the part of the advances appropriated by him for purpose* approved by Colonel Gough but not sanctioned by the Persian Government for such as the irince considerd he can be re quired by us to put forward for sanction by Hie Persian Government. They consist of the Farman Parma 1 s special allowance of Ts. 8,000 a month, supplementary charges for hii personal escort and Government troops, and other administra tive expenditure in excess of the established Government scale. These irrecoverable payments amount to about Ts. 11,000 a month, as mentioned in air Charles Par ling 1 s telegram No* 40 of January 15th, 1918, and No. 336 of April 22nd, 1918, and the subsidies granted since September 21st, 1918, are, for the most part, of this nature.

On 16th December, Sir C. Marling informed the Foreign Offiqe that he was instructing the Imperial Bank to hold Tomans 100,000 a month at the disposal of the Officer Commanding, Cossack Division until funds were available from Russia (telegram 445, P.4990). Correspondence ensued on the subject of providing the necessary currency for the Bank’s purposes, but no further reference to the monthly advances was made till February^when Sir C. Marling authorised payment of the amount due on the 22nd of that month (P.|6Q6), considering it essential to avoid embarrassing the Officer Commanding. The 'certain payments' sanctioned by Council in March, 1918, were in respect of the cost of moving the Meshed detachment nearer to Teheran. The initial extra cost was 9,000 tomans, and the recurring monthly cost 4,000 - 5,000 tomans. The approval of the Secretary of State in Council was conveyed in India Office letter of 21st March, 1918. On 30th March, the Foreign Office informed Sir«*== C, Marling (telegram 174) that His Majesty’s Grovemment 'Iwars prepared ’for the present* to continue to finance the Cossack Division. (P.1320). (P.1041). In April, Sir C. Marling reported (telegram 351 April 24th) that the expenditure in that month would amount to Tomans 150,000. The Director of Milit ar y Intelligence was not satisfied that the money on the Division was well spent (letters 3rd and 20th May) ; but on 14th May Sir 0. Marling (P.2102) applied for‘authority to spend up to Tomans 200,000 from May to July, and thereafter at Tomans 120,000 monthly. The matter came before the Eastern Committee on 21st May, when it was held that there was no alternative to the course proposed (P.2279). Sanction was given bj&gt; the Foreign Office in a telegram of 22nd May (P.2156), and was coupled with instructions to keep expenditure as low as possible. The telegrams were submitted by this Department foi information. In August, Sir C. Marling reported (telegram 729, 22nd August , P.S815) that he was drawing on Foreign Office for Tomans 120,000.

The various payments included in the claim have oeen sanctioned oy Council, with the exception of two items:- (1) A moiety of £5,263. 3. 2, expended on relief measures at Shiras. Relief in money, and in kind, has been given to Shiraz since the end of 1916, and in March 1916, with the approval,of Council, a refund on account of expenditure incurred under this head was made to the Foreign Office. s ^ (2) A moiety of £517,185. 0. 3. expended on the maintenance of the Persian Cossack Division. This is a Persian force which His Majesty’s Government, in December 1917, decided to finance, with the object of preventing the spread of anarchy to Persia. Certain payments in connexion with the Cossack Division were approved by Council in March 1918. It was pointed out at the time in the Departmental Minute that this was the only force left in N. Persia to cope with the situation, which was a very serious one ior India, since if effective measures were not taken the road would be open for enemy penetration into Afghanistan.

No. 222235/17, of November 24th, 1917, will give you the particulars required.Persia : Division of Charges. J. In August 1916 the Secretary of State laid before Council a note (P. 3839/16) prepared m the Political i)ep_artinent, giving information as to existing relations between the Government of India and the Home Government in relation to Persia Persian policy and Persian expenditure. The note described the general position as In 1S9J the Government of India described Anglo-Indian interests in Persia as commercial, political, strategical and telegraphic. Much of the British trade, particularly in the south and east, is with British India, while the north and west avenues of entry are devoted in the main to commercial connections with the British Isles. The political interests of Great Britain in Persia, which, at their revival a century ago, were mainly Indian in inception, are still largely Indian in character. The strategical interests arise from conditions with which India is most intimately concerned, and in lecent ^ yeais I eisia (and especially Southern Persia) has assumed a strategical importance in relation to British India which tends to increase rather than diminish. The telegraphic interests may be said to be equally divided between the mother-country and India. The Consular officers in Southern Persia (and at Meshed) are, by agreement with the Foreign Office, _ members of the Indian Political Department, and in their political capacity report to the Government of India.” 2. In paragiaph 242 of the Report of the Indian Expenditure Commission (1900), better known as ^ the “ Welby Commission,” the following opinion was expressed : The two Governments are not agreed as to the extent of their “ respective interests in Persia. It is, in our opinion, desirable to adopt a general principle of division which will put an end to these discussions. Both countries have “ admittedly a large interest in Persia, and we think that the charges of the Mission “ and Consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries.” The reason why this principle was applied to diplomatic and consular expenditure only was presumably because there was at first no other charge necessitating a division. From 1890 to 1900 India had contributed a moiety of the Karim subsidy (2,0001 per annum), but,- on the recommendation of the Welby Commission (Report, para graph 246), the whole subsidy was, after 1900, defrayed Rom Imperial revenues as a set off to the Baghdad-Basra mail subsidy paid by India. 3. Since 1900 the principle of equal division has repeatedly been put into practice. Apart from interest-bearing loans to a very considerable amount, in all of which we took our share, we have frequently contributed towards expenditure forming no part of the “charges of the Mission and Consulates,” c.r/., (1) we paid half the expenses of the British section of thq Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, and even shared in the compensation paid to the Secretary to the British Commissioners (a Foreign Office officer) for injuries sustained while on duty; (2) we have shared the monthly advances made to the Persian Government under the so-called “Moratorium ” scheme, and also (3) certain payments made to the British Minister at Tehran for secret service purposes ; and (4) we have contributed to various subsidies paid to different individuals and tribes in Persia, both before and during the present war. 4. The question of the incidence of Persian charges was carefully re-examined in 1917 in connection with the cost of the South Persia Rifles and of the Seistan Levy Corps. It w r as exhaustively discussed in a Memorandum prepared by the Financial Department of the India Office (dated the 15th September 1917), of which a copy is annexed to this Note. The conclusion reached avus that, while the cost'of the levies raised in Seistan Avas properly chargeable to Imperial revenues, as forming part of expenditure on military operations in Persia, 1 the cost of the South Persia Rifles, of subsidies and loans during, the Avar, and of secret sendee expenditure, so 1 Under the terms of the Parliamentary Resolutions of November 1914, Imperial revenues bear all the ' extraordinary ” charges of Indian troops employed on military operations out of India.far as not required for purely military purposes, should be equally divided. This view was accepted by the Secretary of State in Council, and the Foreign Office were informed accordingly on the 7th November 1917. 5. Certain other cases not directly covered by the above decisions have since come up for consideration, c.g .:— (1) Relief measures at Shiraz, Meshed, 1 eh ran, and llamadan. In each case the Secretary of State in Council has agreed to bear half the cost. (2) The construction of the Bunder A bbas-Kerman road and telegraph line. The Secretary of State in Council has proposed to the Foreign Office that an outlay of-60,0001. on the former, and of 50,000L on the latter, should be equally shared between the British and Indian Exchequers. 6. On the question of principle, the following note was recorded by the late Secretary of State (Mr. Chamberlain) on the 22nd June 1916 ‘ I have no doubt that they [he., the Welby Commission^ intended future Persian charges to be settled on the half-and-half principle, though some existing charges were balanced against one another .... This war and our recent experiences have demonstrated more clearly than ever before that nothing which touches Persia is alien to India .... ‘ The true and the only ground for such subsidies, and one which is quite conclusive in the present case, is that it is of primary importance to India that Persia should be sufficiently well governed to prevent her from becoming a danger to India through Afghanistan. “ Anyone who reads the draft Mesopotamian Blue Book or who has followed the constant pre-occupation of the Indian Government as to the repercussion of Persian events on Indian security will, I feel sure, admit the force of this argument. Its force is especially manifest in times like the present; but if India be so deeply concerned in Persian politics in a crisis, it cannot wash its hands of Persian charges the moment the crisis passes. Were it not for India, we should not to-day have a man in Persia or up the Gulf, and India is fortunate in her bargain. “ I would therefore accept half charges.” Political Department. India Office, 9th October 1918. m h To Ut lllX-Sec Con line Sea Ooi gThe Foreign Office have presented us with a bill for £99,336. 16. 7 being the Indian share (one half) of certain expenditure incurred in Persia in the years 1916-17 and 1917-18. The various payments included have already been sanctioned by Council with the exception of two items, (1) a moiety of an advance of 30,000 tomans (*£7894. 14. 9) made to the Persian Government in July, 1916^ owing to the danger of the military situationj (2) a moiety of a sum of 25,500 tomans, part of an advance of 214,000 tomans to the Kawam-ul-Mulk, in February, 1917. For the remainder of the advance Council sanction has already been obtained. All the payments are in the nature of war expenditure. The conditions produced by the war have made it necessary for us, in the interests of the security of India, to take an active interest in the maintenance of settled Government in South Persia, and particularly in the province of Fars, the Capital of which (Shiraz) is the head-quarters of the South Persia Rifles. WithWith this object we have from time to time pecuniary rendered/assistance to the pro-British G-overnor-General of Bars (Barman Barma) and to the Chiefs of the two great tribal groups of the Province (Soulet ed Dowleh and Kawam ul hulk), besides grants in money and grain for the relief of local distress, etc., All such expenditure is divisible in equal proportions between the British and Indian exchequers. frt, 7 . tc h 3% !q/&lt;gIn any further communication on the Shbject, please quote No. 43599/w/^ and address— - The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, \ London. ...A' &gt;*|i] ■ {■ i i L ! 91 8 Foreign Office $9) M' if, mu March 20th, 1918. ~ v 2 bir: - I am directed dy -ir.

Besides those-to which I have alluded there is of course other heavy expenditure in Persia, e. g., Indian troops in Pars levied in Seistan India, but tnis is controlled by Indian or Chief Political Officer in Mesopotamia, and I have no direct concern or accurate knowledge of ito -'il 4iRobinson, OA nP • This file was marked by you to Mr .Young, bulf as M dealt vdth oonsular and diplomatic expenditure he brought it to me on the'-.ground that it seemed to be more my side of the Department than 'his. As there seemed to be some force in this contention I hdve taken it over. The accounts given by Colonels Gough and Trevor are not easy to understand, and took me some time to master, -but the following suggested reply will, I hope, make things clear.-? 1. I do not think much stress need be laid on the difference of T^.30,000 for the Bahar£u Expedition in the respective estimates made by the Government of India and Sir C. Marling. Obviously the former telegraphed to the latter that 50,000 would be required in addition to the Ts.30,000 already sanctioned, but the Government of India understood -feew to mean Tf.50,000 including the sanctioned amount. 2. Colonel Gough's account is far from clear, but I have numbered the items contained in it and those in Colonel Trevor’^ statement of the 19th February, and the following comparison between the two will, I think, make matters intelligible:- Col.G o ugh’s Statement . Col .Trevor’s Statement ^ Item No.l y ' 2 corresponds with / &gt; v/ ” y ” 3 4 5 6 7 Item No. 1. ft 12. ” 3. 2. 4. 5 . 9.3. With reference to Item No.5 (left-hand column) corresponding with Item No.4 (left-hand column), it should he explained that it is Colonel Gough's Kr.205,000 that represents Colonel Trevor’s Hs.75,000. Of the |(s.205,'X)0 only Krs.5,000 went to the K^awanv and the residue to Fatel Nulk for payment to the gendarmerie, vide telegram from His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, to Government of India dated 26th November 191S, also telegram from Sir C. Marling to the Foreign Office dated 8th February 1917, para.l. Colonel Trevor being out of pocket to the full £50,000 has included this in his statement, whereas Colonel Gough has included only Kr.5,0C0, the remainder being credited in a different account. Allowing for this it vail be seen that the first 7 items of ( Colonel Gough’s statement, represent £45,000 of the £50,000 that was origi.^l^y sanctioned. ' The remaining 5,000, i.e. Rs.75,000 ptee^Rs.6,392-15-2, being the excess t. shown by Colonel Trevor (^Rb .83,392-13-^r), is accounted for as follows;- Included in Colonel Gough’s item No.8, Excess on Rs.75,000. being first item in Colonel Trevor’s statement, Rs .41,730. ” 1,282. Cost of advance of £10,000 made in February 1916, Item No.12 in Colonel'Trevor’s account, Cost of Arms A Ammunition etc. paid for by Colonel Trevor, Items 6, 7, 8 &amp; II, Excess over Rs.225,000, Items No.2 &amp; 3 in Colonel Trevor’s account, 30,398- 1-11 9,974-15- 3 7-12- 0 TOTAL: Rs.83,392-13- 2. The excess of Rs.1,282 above referred to apparently is due to cost of remittance and the cost of the advance paid in February, amounting to Rs .30,398-1-11, will be found fully explained in Colonel Trevor’s letter.isL 3. From a perusal of the right-hand side of ,Colonel Gough’s account it is quite clear that his 8th item &gt;U' jncTudes, besides the balance of Rs.41,730, the whole of the Kr.800,000 for the Bahar^u Expedition. Apparently it also comprises Kr.42,900 paid through the /an\ to Nazim el Bulk and £4,000 to Sou^et A Dowleh. The latter is presumably part of the £6,285 referred to in the telegram from Sir C. Marling to the Foreign Office dated 23rd October 1917, par a. 3. The gratuity to the Sowars etc. may also form part of this item, but perhaps it will be as well to await Colonel Gough’s separate account before taking any action, p* h'-suggestthat a telegram might be despatched about this should it not arrive within a reasonable time. 1 Thdrs- irtr-dbdrke4^Mpcr''tl'i r, QW more bight on 'the m ILer ~th.an—the e tu u ref er- -lu in i untie Ww s.eiK I'i .On. ij. ^ h / 7Copy. e From To The Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf. ^3SY 3 The Poreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla.

His Majesty’s Consul at Bhiraz found both these items necessary, the former as an inducement to abstain from customary peculation of a Governor General which inducement has, I think, been effective and the latter to supplement inadequate sum sanctioned by Persian Government when the first advances were agreed on, before Parman N rma’s departure j.rom xeheran.

After full discussion with Colonel Gough'! think it will be impossible to recover advance of tomans 80,000 made to Kawain for Baharlu expedition and that it must be looked on as definite expenditure neces sitated by local political situation . Results of expedition enabled Kawam to re-establish his authority in districts bordering Kerman province matter of great importance for security of Couthern Persia Rifles convoys and to pay substantial arrears of taxes to Pars Treasury thereby reducing demands on us from Governor General for advances for purposes of ad ministration. I think we ought also to take into consideration immense losses incurred by Kawam 1 s father through his espousal of our cause during reign of gendarmerie at Shiraz£hnve never been made up to his son and family and that in the circumstances he has some kind of claim on us which would make it very difficult for us to insist on treating tomans 80,000 as an advance to him.. Russian Government would decline liability for expenditure on which they were not even consulted.[This_ Document is the Pr operty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done wi th unless required for official nse.l ' ‘ VTTiKS foNLY.

He now informs me Goulet's attitude is not very satisfactory and asks for permission to pay him an extra 5000 a month for 3 months to induce him to keep to his agreement. In view of altered conditions here which are hound to react unfavourably on Goulet I have authorized Consul who is seeing Goulet today to do as he proposes if absolutely necessary but I think no further payment should bo made to Goulet until he has proved his loyalty to us and earned what he has already had.

It will be observed that the par equivalent of the amount of the loan, Rs750,000/- has been exceeded by its 8,392-13-2* This amount is slightly less than the cost of rifles and ammunition purchased at Muscat ( Fa8,152-5-2) plus the amount paid for freight and landing charges of arms and ammunition from India ( Hs500/-), and on first looking throigh the i ile and acco&amp;nts, and especially niy telegram No* 1665 dated 12th August 1916, in which no men tlQn i&amp; luudQ of tlle *nd a^iunition from Muscat I i -** thoughtthought tlicut the exceed wae due to the omission of this item and put it down to this cause in iny telegram No*253 abovernentioned. Hie sum of Es500/- for’ freight on urm&amp; etc^, front India is in excess any howtos no bill was re ceived until after the account closed* I may here mention that I tliink the item of remittance charges on Krons 94,727 (vide my telegram No* 255 dated 10th February 1917), which has since been paid by His Majesty’s Minister (vide my telegram No* 327 dated 18th February 1917) should be in cluded in this account, as the sum remitted was the final instalment M this advance* These charges would probably be about 9 per cent and amount to some Krans 8,500/- , or probably over la4,500/- at the Tehran rate of exchange. c&gt;* On going into the question of excess further however I find that though the amount of excess is approximately that of the items mentioned, the cost of the rifles etc. at Muscat was not the cause of the excess, which was due to the following:—- Then the Quwam was here in February it was arranged to give him an udvwioa of Kruno 600,000/- in cash, and it was of course neoesaary to get this sura at once. The * T » * imperial Bank of Persia however apparently did not want Rupees or rupee drafts, and refused to give the money(3) v •« n i I .V li 6C T i oi si except for ti draft on London at 46 Krane to the pound a ter ling. At the same time however the Manager said he would he willing to let the Residency have the amount on loan at 7 per cent interest. As the Bank’s selling rate was fluctuating between Kruns 564 &amp;nd 60 per pound sterling, I took the amount on loan. At the rate offered by the Bank the cost of Krans 600,000/- would have been Rs 195^652-2-9, and in spite of the subsequent continous and heavy fall/ in exchange I have been able to adjust the Bank loan at a cost of Rs 180,398-1-11, The Qawam thus benefited by the transaction to the extent of the Kran equivalent of Bs 15,254-0-10, but owing to the continued fall in exchange it was impossible to adjust the account within the necessary limit and the total amount of the sanctioned loan has been exceeded by Rs8, 392-13-2* 4, In view of the fact that before the final instalment of this loan was remitted to Shiraz, additional loans to the Qawam had already commenced and a further sum of 300,GG0Krans had been paid from here not to mention other large sums by His Majesty’s Minister, and having regard to the actual gain in Krans purchased for the Qawam, I trust that the G-overnment of India will be pleased to condone the exceeding for the sanctioned loan.
