Ministry of Economic Warfare, October 3, 1939, Rationing of Neutral Countries. Sir, I TRANSMIT to you herewith a copy of a memorandum which has been prepared in this Department on the subject of the rationing of neutral countries and, more particularly, of the four Scandinavian countries, with which negotiations on this subject have already opened. 2. The memorandum emphasises the importance in this connexion of the War Trade Reporting Organisation both in overseas neutral countries and in adjacent neutral countries; and I shall be glad if you Consular Officers, under your superintendence, as a guide to them in the operation of the reporting system. Additional copies of the memorandum are enclosed for this purpose. w ill transmit ^copies of the memorandum by safe hand to Category I, I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, R. H. CROSS. His Majesty’s Representative at 10604 20070—20 Secret. [ I. 2534 ] Enclosure to Circular E.W. 01. THE MEANING OF “ RATIONING.” AS the word cc rationing ” and the process to which it refers are constantly being mentioned in various documents circulating in this Ministry, it seems possible that it may be useful for various departments of the Ministry to set out the main methods by which the process is possible. This paper does not purport to deal with the minutiae of office machinery involved in the process. 2. One use of the word “rationing” is to describe any procedure whereby, by the exercise of our domestic rights, on the one hand, or our belligerent rights, on the other, we limit the amount of goods permitted to pass through our controls to a neutral destination to a given quantity. In the case of voluntary rationing this is fixed by agreement: in the case of forcible rationing by our own estimate of the neutral country’s bona fide requirements for home consumption. Note that the stress here is on the word “ permitted.” Having limited the number of permits which we give in one way or the other, the process is, in this sense of the word, completed. 3. But the other and more technical meaning of the word “ rationing ” is this : Not only is the function set out in the immediately preceding paragraph followed, but, by means of the arrangements described below, we see to it that we have a check, which ought to be 100 per cent, complete, regarding all current consignments of at least “ key ” commodities reaching neutral countries during a specified period. This complete statistical control is only possible if a definite procedure is followed, both inside the Ministry of Economic Warfare and by War Trade reporting officers and staff abroad. 4. The mechanism is this : The normal bona fide requirements of the four maritime northern neutral countries have already been worked out. In order to compare current monthly imports with these figures, and to produce this statistical comparison not more than, say, a week after the month to which it purports to relate, the following steps are necessary :— (a) To secure a complete list of all ships reaching the four northern Ministry having proper particulars of their cargo. (c) Even when the absence of particulars is due to these vessels having eluded our patrols, it is possible for Statistical Section to insert in their ledgers the cargoes of these vessels, provided that the reporting officers at the port of origin have sent home at the 10604 a 20070—2 a neutral maritime countries daily. {b) To ascertain what vessels have reached those countries without theearliest opportunity a copy of the ship’s manifest (showing gross and net weights). Failing this, telegraphic or other summaries are used, but! for statistical purposes, they cannot compare with a copy of the ship’s manifest. 5 For statistical purposes, it is essential that all particulars of current imports should, as far fs possible, be taken from one category of source and thiT category is the ship’s documents or summaries thereof. Vague references in censorship telegrams, &amp;c., or information from banks about a few consignments really only confuse the issue, though they may sometimes give a hint of what to look for. 6. The result of these steps should be that at the end or within a week of the expiry of a given month a simple statement of figures should be available for the more important commodities, showing— (a) What a neutral country normally imports; and (b) What it has imported in the current month. If -in the course of negotiation for an agreed ration, the neutral country concerned challenges the accuracy of our figures, we can then substantiate our claims ship by ship, and item by item of the cargo. Moreover, the only imports which escape this net are those which do not pass through our controls. It therefore follows that we are in a conespondingly stionger position in arguing about the size of agreed rations because, in cases in which discrepancies do exist between our own figures recorded undei the system described above and the official figures of the neutral country, it is inevitable that the official figures of the neutral country shall be larger. In that case it is reasonable for us to argue— comes from which quarters for which we hyyothesi not affected That the difference responsible; and controls; (b) That it is, therefore, unreasonable for the neutral country to ask us to allow to pass through our cordon of control a greater quantity than, in fact, they have been taking through it./ _ , CALIFORNIA ARABIAN STANDARD OIL COMPANY 'i H'U Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia Janucrylu # 1940 cur^His -Britanic luajesty* s Politicai Agent' rce, ^ I-iugli m ightman,1.0.3.

For your confidential information immediate object is to control exports to Tenyriefe. 3. As regards shipments from Ras Tanura, His Majesty’s Government have of course no legal power to control this traffic at point of shipment and there can be no question of making regulations applicable to it. Nor is there at present any occasion for providing facilities for oil ship ments for European destinations (though question of intro ducing navicert system for oil shipments from Afabia is under consideration). Company may therefore be informed accordingly. Shipments to other than British destinations should however be r§port©d to me by Political Agent by tele graph for information.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent at Bahrain (Hugh Weightman) and the Chief Local Representative of BAPCO (Dr Roger Anthony Kennedy).Following the implementation of an oil export licensing system for Bahrain oil exports, covered by Regulation No. 1 of 1940 of the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council 1939 (ff 46-51, f 63, ff 68-69, f 75, f 254), BAPCO were required to seek approval for all shipments of oil exported out of Bahrain from the Political Agent, who in turn telegraphed the India Office in London for approval. For approved shipments, the Political Agent issued BAPCO with an export licence. The majority of the file is comprised of papers governed by this process: 1) BAPCO export licence applications, signed by Kennedy; 2) telegrams from the Political Agent to the India Office, requesting approval to grant the licence; 3) approval from the India Office; 4) copies of the export licence granted by the Political Agent; 5) copies of the shipment notice, issued by BAPCO.Also included in the file: an undated memorandum outlining the specific details of oil shipments from Bahrain that should be sent to the Secretary of State for India, Government of India and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, including: name of ship, date of sailing, tonnage of oil product; destination; and name of consignee (f 5); a Government circular from the Ministry of Economic Warfare, dated 3 October 1939, concerning the rationing of neutral countries, with particular reference to the Scandinavian countries (f 18); correspondence between the Political Agent and CASOC, relating to the issue of Bills of Lading for oil shipments from Saudi Arabia (ff 18-32); a circular from the British Legation in Tehran, May 1940, relating to the supply of instructions for the
