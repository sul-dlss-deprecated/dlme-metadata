INDIA OFFICE/ From / s ' The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affaire Department, To His Britannic iviajesoy 1 s jclnvoy extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Tehran. Dated Simla, the Subjects- Iranian railways. May 1940. • ' 'T~ 1 IriTSe CT* 1 2559 Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 133, dated the loth May 194 j, I am directed to state that it appears from the information available ».ith the Government of India that the position with regard to the Iranian railways is as follows. The Trans-Iranian railway from Bandar Shahpur to Bandar Shall has been completed and the Iranian Governnent are nov/ busy constructing lines autwain.3 from Tcliran to the east towards Meshed and to the west towards Tabriz, which is already connected by rail with the 'dussiaaa frontier at Julfa. Another line branching off from the Trans- Iranian railway at Quat is being constructed towards the centre of the country at Yezd. It also appears from your telegram under reference that it is the intention of the Iranian Government to link up their railway system with that of Turkey, posoibl/ via Sharif Khansh, to which a lime from Tabriz is understood to exist. 2. This ralJLray system as already in existence an d as contemplated would seem tc encourage trade with the north i.s. with Russia and Germany rather than trade with India. • •..India or overseas via the Persian Uuli\ The railways converge on Tehran which is ranch nearer the Caspian Jea than the Persian Gulf, and Bandar Shahpur is reported to be a miserable port and very unpopular with shippers. The Tabriz diaries show, vide paragraphs 1 and B of the diaries for January and February 1940, respectively, that Iranian goods are being exported via Jjjlfa to Germany, dven though the linking up of Tabriz with the Turkish railway system may be desirable from the political point of view, it would seem doubtful whether it would divert Iranian trade from dussia and Germany, as Turkey pre sumably produces much the same raw materials as Iran. 3. In the light of the above, it would appear that there is little chance of serving British and Indian interests unless the Iranian Government can be persuaded (a) to reopen the railway from hok Kundi to -.ahidan and (b) to link up their railway system with India by lines from Meshed and Yezd to Zahidan if the physical features of the country permit. 4. The above deductions are based on limited inf or ation Mft may be entirely ill- founded, but I am to say that the Government of India are somewhat concerned over possible developments said would be very grateful for an appreciation from you with particular reference to the suggestion for urging a liii-a with India and to the utilisation of the railvvay material which it is proposed that India should supply to Iran. 5 # a copy of this letter is being forwarded to the India Office.

My fjord^ Tehran, December 16, 1938. to b-'W IN paragraph 13 of my despatch No. 296, of the 30th August, regarding the opening of the Trans-Iranian Railway, I had the honour to report that engineers were engaged on a survey of the Tehran—Tabriz section of the piopose east-west line. . , , 2. Early in November it was announced in the press that the experts attached to the Ministry of Roads and Communications were preparing plans for this east-west line, that it would run from Semnan to Meshed and from Tehran to Tabriz, and that work on certain sections of the line would be put in hand in the near future. About the same time the commercial secretary to His Majesty’s Legation was informed that the Consortium Kampsax hoped shortly to sign a contract for a network of railways which would include lines from Tehran to Tabriz, Tehran to Yezd and Kerman, and possibly Tehran to Meshed. , , XT . . , ., ,, 3. Negotiations continued during the month of November, but it recently became apparent that they had broken down. M. Saxild had intended to return to Denmark for a few weeks, but has now decided to remain m lehran until a new Minister of Roads and Communications is appointed to succeed M. Majid Ahy, whose dismissal was reported in my despatch No. 390 cd the 13th December, and who is now definitely understood to be in prison. That M. Saxild is not unduly optimistic can be judged by the fact that he recently told Mr. Bland (a special representative of Messrs. Lindsay, Parkinson and Company) that he would be well advised to return to London, as it was unlikely that any decision would be reached for at least six months. 4. The proposed network of new railways would probably cost between £30 and £40 million, and it is highly probable that the negotations for their construction have broken down over the question of finance. In any case, it is unlikely that the work, except in the sections presenting little or no difficulty, will be entrusted to local contractors, since Mr. Saxild stated recently that the survey undertaken by Iranian engineers was useless and would ha\e to be ( one again by competent surveyors. ^ , .. 5.

AS I had the honour to report in my telegra m No. 99 o f the 24th August, the official opening of the Transiranian Railway was fixed lor the 27th Angus . On that day I addressed a note of congratulations to the Iranian Government, an I enclose a copy herein, together with a copy of the reply which I have now received^ 1 ) Satisfactory publicity was given to my message m the press. Similar messages were sent by a number of other Governments, those fioin Trance, Germany and Denmark taking the form of telegrams to the Shah from the heads of those States. , n 2. On the 16th August, His Imperial Majesty, accompanied by the Grown Prince and a large suite, proceeded by train to Araq (Sultanabad) and thence to Safid Chashmeh, where the ceremony of fastening the last bolt took place and the junction of the north and south sectors of the railway line linking up the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf was officially established. In the presence of the Shah, the first train from Bandar Shapur steamed past on its way to the capital. 3. The Royal train was timed to reach Tehran station at 5 o clock m the afternoon of the'27th August. Invitations to witness the arrival of the first tram and to receive the Shah had been sent to the Diplomatic Corps, Go\ernment officials, the leading foreign residents, and to 1,000 or more Iranians from I ehran and the provinces. I was present at the station with the membeis of my stan. 4. Though the Royal train was not scheduled to arrive until 5 p.m., it actuallv drew in at the’station, which was elaborately decorated, at 4- 40 p.m. The Shah alighted looking very pleased and no doubt conscious that if this great work had been completed it was due entirely to his determination and proud of the fact that he had not had recourse to a foreign loan or foreign capital for this costly enterprise. . , , i i 5. Shortly after the arrival of the Royal train and the customary addiesses, the first passenger train from the south steamed past, followed by a goods train. His Imperial Majesty then left the station, shaking hands with the heads of the foreign missions as he passed. . 6. The same evening a reception was given by the Minister of Communi cations in the station buildings, which was attended by nearly 3,000 people. 7. The 26th August marks a great day in the reign of the present Shah and the completion of a great work which was started eleven years ago and which has cost close on £30 million sterling. It was in 1927 that work on the railway was first started, when an American-Polish group was entrusted with the drawing up of plans and shortly after started on the construction of the line from Bandar Shapur on the Persian Gulf. The work, however, presented great difficulties, laro-e sums of money were being expended, and the results weie unsatisfactoiy, the Government decided, therefore, to cancel the concession and to continue the work themselves. The results of this change-over proved to be no more satisfactory. It was not until 1931 that the Government, having fully realised that they had neither fully qualified railroad constructing engineers nor the necessary experience, decided to entrust the work to a foreign group. The contract for the completion of the whole of the north-south line was entrusted to the Consortium Kampsax. representing the well-known Danish construction engineers, Kamp- mann, KierulfT and Saxild, and Saabye and Lerche, and the Swedish firm of locomotive builders, Nvdovist and Holm. , , , 8 Kampsax divided the work into “ lots,” and subcontracted the work on these lots to different firms. Among the firms selected for this work were two United Kingdom firms, Messrs. Richard Costain (Limited) and Messrs. Nuttall, (pNot printed. [414 q—1]2 Mowlem, Sons and Co., who undertook the tunnelling on Lots 6 and 7, claimed to be the most difficult piece of work on the whole line. 1 heir work, which was carried out under quite abnormal conditions, deserves the highest praise. 9. The total length of the line from Bandar Shapur on the Persian Gulf to Bandar Shah on the Caspian Sea is 1,394-160 kilom. (or just over 870 miles), with over 4,700 bridges and 224 tunnels. . . 10. In order to form an idea of the magnitude of this undertaking, it will suffice to say that from 40,000 to 50,000 men were employed by Kampsax when the work was at its height. Of these 95 per cent, were recruited locally, the remainder being made up of Greeks, Italians, Swiss, &amp;c. About 10,000 tons of cement and over 100,000 kilog. of explosives were consumed monthly. One hundred and thirteen thousand tons of iron rails have been laid down and over 2,100,000 sleepers 11. Much attention has been devoted to the types of locomotives likely to be most suitable in a country where they are expected to ascend to 2,173 metres. Up to the present sixty-seven locomotives have been imported, eight from Messrs. Beyer-Peacock and Co., of Manchester, twelve from the Swedish firm, Nahab, and the remainder from Ferrostahl in Germany. One thousand one hundred and sixty-seven passenger coaches and goods trucks are at present in the country, and 1,130 are on order in Germany, but have so far not been delivered. 12. From north to south there are ninety stations with up-to-date buildings, and, linking up the Caspian to the Gulf, the railway passes through the following more important towns : Shahi, Tehran, Qum, Araq, Andimeshk and Ahwaz. 13. After eleven years the Shah’s most ambitious project has been realised, but, in replying to the Prime Minister’s address at Safid Chashmeh, he let it be understood that this was only the first part of the programme completed, and that he expected further sacrifices from the country in order to complete in time a whole network of railways which would open out the whole country. Actually engineers are engaged on a survey of the Tehran-Tabriz road, and work on this section is expected to start early m 1939. Also, according to the Persian press, the survey of the Qum—Anarek extension has been made from Qum to a point 60 kilom. south of Kashan. at which town the site for the station has also been selected. 14.

W 0 3 5/J'* WITH reference to Mr. Seymour's despatch No. 312 of the 14th August, 1937. I have the honour to inform you that it is reported that the Iranian Government have definitely placed with various German firms a large order for locomotives and rolling-stock required for the Trans-Iranian Railway. The order is understood to provide for 1,103 goods wagons, twenty-seven passenger coaches and postal vans, and sixty-five locomotives. It is possible that the sixty-five locomotives include the twenty second-hand locomotives said to have been purchased in Vienna in 1937, since these engines are not known to have arrived. The total value of the order is probably in the neighbourhood of £2 million. 2. It is understood that there are at present twenty-five engines on each section of the railway, so that a total of 115 will be available when the German order is delivered. It is certain that many more engines will be required, as will large numbers of oil-tankers for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. It is under stood that the company are themselves arranging for the purchase of oil-tankers, also in Germany. As you are aware, the company are now planning to base their distribution in Central, Northern and North-Eastern Iran on the railway, big depots being built at Azna (near Sultanabad) and Firuzkuh. It is also said that the company will pump oil from Abadan to Ahwaz by pipe-line, for loading- on the railway there. Unless the service on the railway shows a very great improvement, the company may encounter serious difficulties in their new distribution system. A recent and well-informed visitor to the southern section of the railway stated that the engine-drivers' pay was so miserably small that they had stripped their engines of everything detachable that they could sell. And if another report is to be believed, conditions on the northern line are so bad that when the Shah recently travelled by railway to Mazanderan, there was only one single engine in working order on the whole section, so that if that engine had broken down, no relief engine could have been sent. If a better service cannot soon be obtained, the railway seems likely to prove an expensive luxury. 3.

I HAVE the honour to report that it has been announced that work has been started on a branch line to connect Semnan with the Trans-Iranian Railway at Qishlaq, 114-5 kilom. from Tehran. The new line will be of about 114 kilom. and is intended for the transport to the foundry under construction at Aminabad of the Semnan iron deposits. I understand that no great engineering difficulties are involved in this scheme. 2. Work on the southern section of the railway is being hastened, and it would appear that the whole line might be completed by the end of this year. 3. I understand that a stock of 50,000 tons of cement is held at the factory near Tehran for use on the Tehran-Tabriz Railway, which will presumably be commenced on the completion of the Trans-Iranian. The proposed alignment will apparently follow the Tehran-Tabriz road up to Zendjan, when it will turn to the west in order to avoid the mountainous districts, and will probably go near Saoudjbulagh and through Maragha to Tabriz. From Tabriz to Qotur on the Turkish frontier the branch line of the Djulfa Railway, from Sofian to Sharafkhaneh on the northern shore of Lake Urmia, may be used, or possibly a new branch line may be laid from Morand through Khoi to Qotur. ^ Though the detour from Zendjan will lengthen the distance from Tehran to Tabriz, it is expected to save expenditure, as apparently very little tunnelling will be necessary. 4.

J a wrF:u£ 14THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOYERNM I HAVE the honour to inform you that on the afternoon of Friday, the 19th February, the Shah, accompanied by the Valiahd and other Royal princes, performed the ceremony of inaugurating the northern sector of the Trans- Iranian Railway at the still unfinished station in Tehran. I enclose a copy of the issue of the Journal de Teheran of the 21st February, containing an account of the proceedings and the speech of the Minister of Communications,(') which summarises what has and what remains to be accomplished. It will be seen that it is hoped to complete the southern sector next year. 2. The ceremony seems to have been a success. The day was a Moslem Sunday; Tehran and the neighbouring villages were befiagged by order, and large crowds streamed on foot, by motor-bus or other vehicle down the handsome new boulevard which leads to the station on the south-western outskirt of the city. The station is a fine, if extravagant, building; it stands high, and future travellers emerging from it will enjoy a wide and magnificent panorama of the Alborz range with Demavend dominating the north-east. 3. Only eight Europeans are said to have been invited to the ceremony, among them the three principal directors of the Kampsax Consortium. The chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran was, I believe, the only British subject to be invited. It was explained to the Diplomatic Corps that their turn would come when the whole railway was finished, but some resentment was felt at their exclusion by the representatives of the Scandinavian countries in particular. M. Engell, Minister of Denmark, who resides normally in Moscow, had made a special visit to Tehran for the occasion and to present decorations to the Shah as well as to the principal Kampsax officials. He can hardly have anticipated that he would not be invited to attend the ceremony. 4. Passenger trains will not run the full northern sector for another three months at least. The Shah is believed to be about to visit the south, and great efforts are certainly being made to speed up the completion of the southern sector. The newspapers, I need hardly say, have used the occasion to renew their tributes to the Shah's energy and vision, and to the confidence created by his personality, without which foreign capital on the large scale required would not have been forthcoming. 5. I enclose also some photographs from other issues of the Journal de Teheran which give an idea of the station at Tehran and of the scale of the railway. ( 2 ) 6.

IN my despatch No. 71 of the 26th February last I had the honour to report the official inauguration of the northern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway. A regular daily service between Tehran and Bander Shah started on the 5th June last. 2. From a reliable source I now hear that the daily passenger service has been discontinued owing to the shortage of workable engines, only about four now being available. Careless handling and lack of essential spare parts, coupled with inefficient repair shops, are responsible for the present situation, and have reduced the regular service to an occasional train mainly for the transport of rails for the section between Tehran and Qum. 3. From the same source I understand that twenty second-hand engines were recently purchased in Vienna for immediate and urgent despatch to the northern section. The Soviet Union having refused transit through the Caucasus, the engines have to be taken to pieces and shipped to Bander Shapour on the Persian Gulf, and thence transported to Bander Shah for assembly. By the time they arrive and are ready for work, service on that section is likely to be in a chaotic state. 4. It was further reported that the arrangement for the supply by Ferrostahl of sixty locomotives and 1,000 waggons has fallen through owing to the Germans now demanding higher payments. The Danes hope to obtain an order for some thirty out of the 1,000 waggons, and it is thought that the balance of the requirements may be supplied by Skoda and another German group. 5.

Trans-Persian Railway The report of the National Bank of Persian for the financial year ending 20th March 1934, gives some details regarding the progress of H.I.M’s greatest development scheme. 34. On the southern section, the railway was declared open to Salahabad in January 1933, but regular traffic still does not pass this point although another 30 miles were reported to be under construction. 35. On the northern section, regular traffic reached Shahi in August 1933, but though in the last few months this section has received most of the expenditure on railway construction, only another 20 miles of line have been completed, while a further 27 miles are in hand. (R.A.P. Intelligence Report). 36. An unconfirmed report from Bushire says that there have recently been several ’’wash-outs' 1 on the southern section of the line, which have caused considerable damage. 37. Ullen Construction Corporation . The American Company, who completed the first part of the southern section of the railway a few years ago were violently denounced in all the Tehran newspapers in the middle of the month. They were accused of bad v/orkmanship, lavish waste of money on an unnecessary number of unskilled engineers, and bad planning. The newspapers estimate that the Company should pay damages to the extent of about £800,000. 38. As it is stated in the nev/spapers that parts of the line laid down by the Company have had to be re-laid since, it may possibly be due to the ’’wash-outs' reported in para.36 above.

Of the five lots awarded on the northern section since the beginning of the current Persian year, four were obtained by Persian firms, and the fifth (lot 16) by a Graeco-Persian firm. Only one additional lot (No. 11) has been awarded on the southern section, and this was obtained by a Belgian firm, Societe coloniale de Constructions. The British firm of Edmund Nuttal, Sons and Co. and John Mowlem and Co. (Joint) (Limited) competed for this lot, but their tender, which offered a discount of 20 15 per cent, on the set price, was 0 45 per cent, (or about £4,500) higher than that of the successful Belgian group. I understand that the British firm, whose representatives are now leaving Persia, may possibly compete again at a later date for one or other of the remaining lots on the southern section. 3. It will be observed that considerable progress is being made on the northern section, which in all probability will be completed within two years. The southern section, however, will take longer than was previously anticipated, lot 11 alone being scheduled to take three years. It is doubtful if the southern section will be completed in much less than six years. 4. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T.

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received May 24.) (No. 237.) „ e Tehran, May 5, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No._134 of the 21st March last, I have the honour to report that it is persistently rumoured here that, owing to inadequate funds, the Persian Government are unable to proceed with the construction ot the north-south railway at the rate previously anticipated, and that it is not proposed to allot any further construction lots on the southern section for one year or possibly two years. It is further said that differences have arisen between the Government and the Kampsax Consortium, that funds which are due to the latter on account of construction on parts of the southern section are being withheld, and that, in consequence, work has been stopped on some of the lots, particularly that of the Etea-Rahan Syndicate. Kampsax are said to be claiming compensation from the Persian Government, as a stoppage of work in the south will make it impossible for them to complete the railway within the time stipulated in their contract. 2. It is difficult to confirm these rumours, but colour is lent to them by the visit to the commercial secretariat a few days ago of an Italian engineer, Signor Luis Andreane, who had come to Persia with a view to railway construction. Signor Andreane had heard that no further lots were to be awarded for another year, and therefore wished to know whether there was any possibility of his obtaining work on railway construction in India. He had been informed that lot 5 in the south, valued at 40 million rials and scheduled for completion in three years, would now be delayed for another year, as only o million rials was available for it this year. Signor Andreane was of the opinion that the time limit for construction of the southern section would be extended to seven years, but he thought that the northern section would also be affected by the delay. 3. His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz recently reported that the firm of Boudaghian et Associes, who are engaged on one of the construction lots on the southern section, recently offered to cut their losses by paying 1 million rials to the Government in order to be relieved from their contract. 4. An interesting rumour, emanating from a German source in Tehran, is to the effect that the holding up of construction on the southern section only would lead to diplomatic intervention by His Majesty’s Government, who are believed to be insisting that construction on both sections of the railway must be carried forward at the same rate. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B.) 70), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 34). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. P S.—Since the above was written, a Mr. D. S.'Georgopoulqs, manager of an important Greek engineering firm, has called on the commercial secretary, and his information approximately tallies with the foregoing. He had been told that owing to lack of funds, all work on the southern section was being suspended for one and a half years, and that in the meantime all efforts will be concentrated on completing the northern section. Before work could be resumed in the south the Persian Government would either have to raise a loan or receive a proposition for the construction of an 80 kilom. stretch in three years at a cost of 400 million rials (approximately £5 million) against payment in five years, the first payment to be made after eighteen months. -n tt tr [115 aa—2]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST^S ^JHSfttJJ^ENT ’ PERSIA.

WITH reference to my despatch No . 17 of the 12th January, respecting the Trans-Persian Railway, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a memorandum by Mr. Gray showing the progress made in the allocation of sub-contracts by the Kampsax Consortium at beginning the Persian year 1313, which begins to-day. 2. The only foreign firms who have shown much interest in these sub-contracts have been Italian, but, as Mr. Gray explains, the number of miles for which the Italian firms have secured contracts is not very large. A list of firms who tendered for some recent railway contracts was contained in Mr. Simmonds’s despatch No. O.T. (B) 19 of the 19th February, and illustrates the cosmopolitan character of the interests centring around the construction of the railway. Some firms, for instance Julius Berger, regularly submit tenders, but decline to accept the conditions of the standard contract offered by the consortium on behalf of the Persian Government (see Mr. Simmonds’s despatch No. O.T. (B) 138 of the 14th July, 1933). One British firm, Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Co., has shown an intermittent interest in the subject, but they are not represented locally and have not so far obtained any contracts. An Italian subject, whose name, I think, is Baducci, arrived in Tehran in February as the representative of a Belgian railway constructional firm, and will presumably submit tenders on behalf of his firm in connexion with any lots which may be adjudicated in the near future. 3. Mr. Gray’s memorandum also deals with the alignment of the railway between Burujird and Tehran, which has been changed several times. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 45), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s consul at Ahwez (No. 27). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Railway Construction. I WENT and saw Christensen, secretary to Kampsax, recently, to try and obtain up-to-date news as to the position. I have also seen Hocklin, one of the non-Kampsax Swedes employed in the Railway Department. Christensen kindly gave me a recent map, dated the 26th December, 1933, showing the whole alignment from Bander Shah to Bander Shahpur. Both the northern and southern sections show changes since details were last furnished. 2. The distance from Bander Shah to Tehran is now shown as being 487 kilom. instead of 458, but the real distance is, nevertheless, still about 460 kilom. This is because the kilometrage has been taken from the previous measurements by the German consortium; the Germans, however, were working on a maximum gradient of 20 per 1,000, whereas Kampsax are working on a maximum of 28 per 1,000. Hence, the alignment has been shortened by 27 kilom.; but, for convenience, the kilometrage over large sections has been left unaltered, at any rate for the present, the missing 27 kilom. being cut out at kilometre 261, where the stone has 261 on one side and 288 on the other. On the map of the 26th December, 1933, however, the missing kilometres are shown as cut out between kilometres 249 and 276, that is, between lots 11 and 12 [90 1—2]2 3. The distance between Bander Shahpur and Tehran is shown on the map at just under 1,000 kilom. The alignment after Burujird has again been changed, and now goes north to Malayer, and down, east by south, to Sultanabad, instead of more directly to Sultanabad. This was decided upon in order to avoid very heavy work, which would have been necessary by the more direct alignment. The survey of the stretch between Burujird and Tehran has, however, not yet been seriously attempted, and the indicated alignment should not be taken as definitely the final correct one. 4. The attached table shows how the lots have so far been allotted^ 1 ) 5. Lot 5 in the southern section was put up for tender, to be awarded by limited adjudication, only eight or nine firms being allowed to participate. I gathered that this did not mean discrimination, but only the elimination of small concerns not considered suitable. The tenders were examined on the 13th March, and, though the contract was not expected to be signed till after the new year, it seems fairly certain that a Russian engineer, Kozakovsky, backed by Armenian capital, will secure the contract. His tender was apparently 6 per cent, better than the next best, submitted by Etca-Rahan, the Eranco- Persian group. 6. Lots 6 to 11 in the southern section will most likely be awarded during the coming Persian year (1313). 7. It will be noticed that Italian firms, far from having secured 400 miles, as reported in the Near East of the 11th January, have obtained five lots (6 to 10) in the north totalling 45 kilom., and one lot (No. 3) in the south of 11 kilom. The total Italian lots therefore come to 56 kilom., or 35 miles, only, but they may, of course, anticipate further orders. 8. Christensen said the contractors had had a bad time this winter with snow and floods, especially in the north. It was difficult to victual the workers; this had to be done from different centres, communication with which had been interrupted. 9. Saxild has now returned, and Wright has gone on leave for a few months. F. A. G. GRAY.

Herr Horst’s suggestion as to the reason for placing a substantial order for trucks, &amp;c., with a British firm is interesting, though wide of the mark. It is pertinent to add that Mr. Jacks, resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Tehran, has informed me that he thinks it probable that the whole order for these requirements might go to the United Kingdom. 2. Herr Horst’s comparison of the probable development of Japanese trade in cheap articles with Germany’s trade before the war is illuminating and probably reasonably accurate. 3. A copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (h) 2). I have, &amp;c. P TT TTO A T? P Enclosure in No. 1. Rolling-Stock for the Persian State Railway. HERR HORSCHITZ-HORST told me that, so far as he was aware, over forty offers had been received from foreign firms in connexion with the call for tenders for wagons, &amp;c., for the Persian Railway. He asked me whether British firms had tendered, and I said I did not know as any offers would go direct to the Ministry of Communications and I would not necessarily be informed. With regard to the reported order for sixty wagons ordered from Metro-Vic- Cammell, he was under the impression that it was for tank wagons. I said I did not think this was the case, but that it was for ordinary covered wagons for the State Railway. He then suggested that this was a form of ‘ ‘ douceur on the part of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the recent agreement. I professed ignorance on this point, as I do not yet know the full conditions under which the order was placed. So far as I know, the offer was secured by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with the double object of encouraging British trade and assisting the Persian Government by eliminating agents’ fees and other tortuous negotiations. Herr Horschitz-Horst thought that British firms stood little chance of getting any other orders in connexion with this call for tenders, since German specifications as to type were required, but no specific details as to quality were insisted on. He thought that German firms could make the truck of matchwood at rock-bottom prices which would defy competition. Herr Horschitz-Horst was rather interesting on the subject of Japanese competition. He said that before the war Germany captured a large part of the British and other foreign markets by exporting “cheap and nasty” articles, which were comparatively worthless, but which sold readily. The obligation to mark these “Made in Germany” did them no harm once the market was obtained, as the quality of the goods was subsequently steadily improved. [15 gg—l]2 Similarly, Japan was now flooding the Persian and other markets with goods whose only merit was their cheapness, but he was convinced that, when the markets were dominated and competitors ousted, the Japanese would letam e markets by supplying goods of a better quality. They had both the intelligence and the ability to do this. . The comparison is interesting, especially coming from a trerman. SIDNEY SIMMONDS.

Railway .—The Dano-Swedish Syndicate, who have secured the contract for the further construction of the Trans-Persian Railway, have now assumed charge of both northern and southern sections. M. Black, a Dane, and M. Widin, a Swede, are in charge of the southern section, and it is understood that M. Lindhal, a Swede, will continue to supervise work on the northern part of the line. The Government will pay to the syndicate a sum equivalent to 5,000 dollars for each kilometre constructed, this amount to be payable in equal proportions of rials and foreign currency.Vt- Mtf 4. Commercial. (i) The contract with Messrs. Nordquist and Holm, of Sweden, for the completion of the Trans-Persian Railway is about to be signed. They will be paid by the Government on a kilometric basis, out of which they will have to defray all their organisation and surveying expenses. It is understood that Danish interests are represented in the company. The contractors are apparently prepared to undertake the completion of the northern section in four years and the southern section in six years, both sections presumably to be constructed simultaneously. (ii) Under pressure from the U.S.S.R. a contract for the supply of rails for the further construction of 600 kilom. has been placed with that country. Although it seems doubtful if the Soviets themselves are able to supply all the material required, they made it quite clear that, unless they received the order for the requirements of both sections, they would not allow the transit of rails from any other country to Bander Shah, and raised the transport rate from Batum to 26 dollars per ton. As the Shah insists that construction in the north must continue apace, the Persians had no alternative but to place the entire contract in the U.S.S.R. (iii) Trade representatives from the various provinces are now in Tehran endeavouring to persuade the Government to abrogate the existing commercial treaty with Russia and to conclude a new treaty, the conditions of which will be more advantageous to Persia. (iv) It is announced in the press that arrangements are practically complete for the granting to an American company (presumably Mr. Friedlieb) of the monopoly of tobacco for a period of fifteen years. Four million tomans is to be paid fo/the first year of the monopoly, this sum to be progressively increased by 200,000 tomans each subsequent year. 1 The project will be submitted for ratification by the Majlis as soon as it has been approved by the Council of Ministers.coi y.

Ts. 500 £1000 My Lord Marquess, The Commercial Secretary to this Legation, in a memorandum forwarded to Your Lordship^ predecessor under cover of Sir Robert Olivet despatch No.223 of May 5th last, outlines the terms on which the German railway consortium had expressed their willingness to complete the Bander- Shah-Tehran section of the North to South railway. As anticipated by Mr. Thomas Brown, this offer was turned down by the Persian Government who still appear determined to construct the line themselves, both in the North and South. About the same time the Belgian engineer who had been put in charge in the North asked to be relieved of his duties on being credited with five hundred tomans instead of the one thousand pounds sterling he had asked for to repair the locomotives that had been damaged by the Persian boys, fresh from their one to two years training in a German technical school, whom the authorities had insisted must be quite competent to drive such simple things as railway engines. Monsieur van der Hulst was succeeded by the Japanese engineer in Persian employ. 2. On August 18th the Mejlis authorised the Government to engage sixty seven foreign engineers, assistants and technicians 'for the completion of the railroad between the port of Shahpur and Lizful, as well as for the survey and the The Most Honourable The Marquess of Reading G.C.B., etc., etc., etc. The Foreign Office.the construction ol* the line from Dizful northwards and from Aliabad southwards, apart from the organization of a central ^ technical administration and the exploitation of the northern and southern sections,” The annual credit to cover their salaries and travel expenses is not to exceed four hundred Ts.440,000 and forty thousand tomans and the contracts are to he made out for two years, 3, Much to the astonishment of the deputies, the nationality of these experts was not mentioned, the question being left to the decision of the Council of Ministers. 3o far only a Swede has he; n engaged to take over from the Japanese engineer in the North, the latter’s ignorance of any language other than his own having presumably proved too serious a handicap. Two other Swedish engineers have been surveying the northern section, perhaps in connection with the supply of railway material in virtue of the contract recently placed with a Swedish syndicate, and it is more than likely that as many owedes will be employed as possible. 4.

Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received May 16.) (No. 223. Confidential.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a memorandum by the commercial secretary, dated the 5th May,, 1931. on the subject of a journey to Mazanderan. Tehran, May 6, 1931. PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL 9 31 Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Lincjeman on his Journey to Mazanderan. (Confidential.) ON hearing that the Germans were handing over the northern section of the railway to the Persian Government, I thought it would be interesting to see how matters stood, in order to have some basis for comparison in case I had further opportunity of seeing the line after it had been in Persian hands for some time. 2. My wife and I left Tehran by car on the morning of the 11th and camped that same night at Kharkhun, a delightful little spot with a great hump-backed bridge a few miles out of Aliabad, where there is a Government forestry station under an Austrian. M. van der Hulst, the Belgian engineer in charge of the line, had just left Aliabad when we arrived there next morning, so that we followed him to Sari, which seems to be the administrative headquarters. The weekly train did not leave until the 15th, so that we continued to Meshed-i-Sar, after booking our seats on the train for the Wednesday and arranging for our return from Bandar Shah in a trolley the next day. 3. In Meshed-i-Sar the Director of Customs confirmed the fact that trade was at a standstill, although it was perhaps more than chance that the Russians had closed their frontier to Persian imports as soon as they had cleared the last shipment of Nishapur cotton. No Russian imports were coming in either. 4. Frantic preparations were being made for the present journey of the Shah to Gilan and Mazanderan. A trestle bridge was being constructed across the Babul Rud at Meshed-i-Sar itself, to obviate the use of a ferry, which we found positively dangerous owing to the low level of the river. We heard that the coastal road was being improved, especially where the bridges were concerned, but we found the sandy track to Feri Kenar anything but encouraging. 5. On our way through Barfurush we visited the palace that is being built for the Shah in a big garden with some fine trees just outside the town. The palace is quite unpretentious as to size. Perhaps the elaborateness of the stucco work adorning the facade, hopelessly out of place in so simple a setting, is intended to make one overlook the fact, while the cupids hanging in festoons on the Nottingham lace curtains gave the note to the interior decoration. 6. I asked what impression the building of this palace was making on the local inhabitant, and was told two things, which are undoubtedly symptomatic of the popularity of the Shah in his native province : (1) that all the water available was being commandeered for the needs of the palace garden (without payment, of course), so that the small cultivators of the neighbourhood were being ruined; and (2) that the Mazanderani could not forget that the Shah had drunk out of the “ jub,' or, in other words, out of the gutter, like every good Persian. 7. Primarily owing to the severe economic depression, but also owing to conscription, which had only been introduced some ten days before (thus accounting for the files of young men one saw on the roads wending their way [146 q—3]2 , towards the capital, where there was a good chance of their escaping detection), there seemed to be a very strong but latent feeling of discontent. In fact, the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Barfurush went so far as to say that, in his opinion, a match would set the province alight. 8. Regarding the syndicate of merchants that had been formed to trade with the Russians on a basis of equality,” I was told that the chief merchant of the town had flatly refused to contribute towards the share capital. He had consequently been clapped into gaol for forty-eight hours, at the end of which he promised 20,000 tomans. The smaller merchants followed suit with more modest sums, which they apparently never expect to see again. The whole proceedings are looked upon as a novel form of extortion and nothing else. 9. Other signs of His Majesty's rapacity were not lacking : In Sari, the garden near the station, with its lovely cypresses, which he forced the owner to sell for a song; in Aliabad, the hotel which he is building as a speculative venture, and the spinning mill in course of erection, which Persians say will be His Majesty's if it is a success and the National Bank's if it proves a failure. 10. Colonel Dodd wrote a very comprehensive report on the technical aspect of the railway in October last, which he forwarded to the War Office at the time. I need, therefore, do no more than record my personal impressions of what I saw. 11. The line is obviously very well laid, no expense having been spared in its construction. Even the Belgian engineers—there are two and a Frenchman — admitted this. Although it took us something like five hours to travel 128 kilom. in a very comfortable carriage, at an average speed, therefore, of sixteen miles an hour, they said there was no reason why the train should not be driven at 100 kilom. an hour. The absence of freight and the slowness of the journey were explained by the fact that the trains were essentially “ trains de service,” which took building materials from one point to another; but it is difficult to imagine what freight there could possibly be, except for cotton and rice, from one station to another nearer a port of shipment. 12. It is curious to see the very German, but not unattractive, and solidly built stations dotting the Persian country-side. They remind one that the German contractors are far from being entirely to blame for the comparatively high cost of construction, taking the line as a whole. They are the first to admit, for instance, that the station at Sari, with its 10,000 or so inhabitants, would normally suffice for a town ten times as large. They also say that they built in the end only half the number of stations, complete with waiting rooms and concrete lavatories for the two sexes, which the Persians asked for. 13. One is naturally inclined to look upon this railway as a mere toy—an inclination which is heightened by the excitement of the populace at the stations, where the lavatories of the first-class carriage seem to offer an irresistible form of attraction for the bolder spirits—but I at least found myself a little carried away by the grandeur of the scenery. The terminal at Bandar Shah also seemed quite impressive in the twilight and most business-like, particularly the engine-shed, with its studio-like windows, its five gigantic locomotives and luxuriously fitted workshop. One feels quite at the end of the world in this corner of the Turkoman plain, and the battle being waged against swamp and sea seems born of quite a noble conception until one remembers with a start how useless it all is, and how very pathetic. 14. There were already enough mosquitoes about—great, big, black brutes —to make one realise how malaria-ridden and intolerable the whole place must be in the summer. Yet plans are being gaily laid for the construction of a large town at Bandar Shah! As the Persian engineers who took us round remarked, millions of tomans would first have to be spent on the reclaiming of the swamps that stretch right up to the station in winter. 15. To travel to the end of the jetty in a slow-moving trolley is quite an excursion, there being 1,050 metres of mud embankment and 1,440 metres of wooden structure. There was not a single ship in sight. 16. The Belgian engineers are apparently being entrusted with the extension of the line to Surkh Kulah (marked Sorkala in some maps), 30 kilom. south of Aliabad, along the river bed. Two small tunnels will probably have to be built. They hope to be allowed to continue the line as far as Tehran, their policy being obviously to make out that they can build it much cheaper than the Germans, and flatter Persian sentiment by making use of as many Persian3 engineers as possible. M. van der Hulst wears a Pahlavi cap, which says a great deal for his methods. He boasted to me that he could construct the mountain section at one-third of the German estimate by steepening the gradient trom '2 to 4^ per cent., and narrowing the curves from 300 to 200 metres. What was the use, he said, of building a perfect railway, designed to carry an enormous amount of traffic at the most economic rates, when that traffic did not exist. They only needed to cater for 300 tons a day. I suspected at the time that he had simply adopted, with slight modifications, the plans for an alternative and more economical trace which had been submitted by the syndicate only to be turned down by the Government as not being good enough. (The syndicate, it will be remembered, always maintained that they could show a saving of £10 million on the total estimated cost of £35 million for the whole north to south line by putting in sharper curves and steeper gradients.) 17. This suspicion has now been confirmed by Mr. Thomas Brown, who told me something about the revised estimates which the Germans were just about to put in. He said that they were ready to contract for the completion of the line from Aliabad to Tehran in five years for a fixed sum of 14 million dollars and 20 million tomans, representing an economy of almost two-thirds on the estimates which had originally been accepted by the Government in principle. The maximum gradient was 4J per cent, and the minimum curve 220 metres. They would guarantee that this line would carry fifty trains a day if need be! Realising the difficulty for the Persian Government of finding foreign exchange under existing conditions, they had prepared an ascending scale of payments for the dollar portion, the first instalment to be paid in the second year only and the last in the eighth or ninth. They were not asking the Government to pledge any given security, but would be content with clean trade bills. I suggested to Mr. Brown that he had already arranged for the discounting of these bills. He smiled, and said that Persia's financial credit was still surprisingly good in Europe. It was perhaps in this connexion that a director of the Deutsche Orient Bank recently appeared in Tehran on a short visit. 18. Mr. Brown admitted that he was very much afraid that these proposals would be turned down by the Persian Government, as the latter seemed intent at the moment on extending the line at both ends themselves. He thought, however, that van der Hulst, who was no construction engineer, would get himself into an awful mess in two or three months. The Germans could afford to play a waiting game. He was also in favour of allowing Mr. Carroll in the south enough rope to hang himself. With luck they (whoever “ they ” may be) would also secure the southern contract within a year. “If only,” he added piously, “we could get a good British firm to take over the task of construction.'
