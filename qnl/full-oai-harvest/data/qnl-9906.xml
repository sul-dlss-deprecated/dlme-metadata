Most of the file consists of copies of telegrams between the following British officers: the Political Resident, Bushire (also serving as British Consul-General); the British Consul, Kerman; the British Minister, Tehran. Other correspondents in the file include the following: the Political Agent, Kuwait; the British Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr; the Ruler of Kuwait, Sheikh Ahmad al Jabir as Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]; the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs.The majority of the file is concerned with a case involving a Kuwaiti sailing craft that was reportedly seized by an Iranian warship (an Imperial Iranian Navy ship referred to as HIMS
                           Babr) near Henjam [Henjān] on suspicion of smuggling, and towed to Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh]. Much of the correspondence between British officials is concerned with confirming whether or not the boat was outside Iranian territorial waters when it was seized.Another case relates to a Kuwaiti boat that was apparently seized by Iranian customs officials at Qusbeh (also referred to as Gusbah) [Qoşbeh-ye Manī‘āt, Khuzestan, Iran], on the Iranian side of the Shatt al Arab. The third and final case concerns a Kuwaiti dhow that was reportedly seized at Khorramshahr.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Kerman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qusbeh</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Detention</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
