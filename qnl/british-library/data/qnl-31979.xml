Fifteen months have since elapsed and 1 now find myself required to repatriate from Basra, number of oHicials, some of them highly-educated men who have been living in our midst and have become intimately acquainted with whole of our administrative and military system. am, therefore, strongly opposed to their despatch on military grounds In view of recent captures by Sherif, there must, 1 think, lie a considerable number of individuals suitable for this exchange, and I beg that the expedient ol substituting from amongst them the number of individuals namely, six that were required from here to make up the complement mav be admitted. r From Viceroy, 5th October 1916.

Reason is that Cairo secret service particularly wishes to interview certain individuals en route. Can you therefore please ensure that party goes that way.

I advocate despatch of party earliest possible date, and I do not consider it necessary to hold out for the mutual exchange to be con tern ooraueous.

As he himself understood that it was only the exchange of ladies for civil officials that was contemplated, he thinks there is some misunderstanding. If there is any misunderstanding the reference to the Residency guard has perhaps been the cause of it. In that case I suggest that the proposal be renewed omitting Residency guard thus limiting the exchange to ladies and civil officials.

Reference Secretary of State’s telegram of October 12th§. Sudden change §SermiNo. 19 . of attitude of Ottoman Government just as we are approaching Baghdad can only be regarded as suspicious as they must be well aware that over 100 Amara officials are now in India. Turks probably hope that arrangements regarding details of exchange ?(delayed) owing to Amara officials not being here on the spot and that our advance may be delayed thereby pending arrival of reinforce ments ; while they will repudiate responsibility for safety of ladies if we refuse to delay advance. Of course their offer might conceivably be prompted by simple fact that they are unable to get ladies away and think that we shall take them over ourselves in a few days now that we are approaching Baghdad and so while exchange is still open they are anxious to get their officials handed over. But this explanation seems the less likely of the two. In reply I') A would suggest that the offer of the Turkish Government be acknowledged in suitable terms and that they should be asked to direct the commander of Turkish forces in Mesopotamia, to hand over the British women and children who are detained in Baghdad, to the commander of the British troops which are now in contact with the Ottoman forces on the Tigris as soon as possible ; and that the Turkish Government should be requested to inform us where 25 Turkish Amara officials who are now in India should be repatriated. j The transaction cannot for military reasons be regarded as in any way fettering or suspending the action of the British forces in Mesopotamia as this exchange is a secondary consideration and this fact should be made clear to the Porte.
