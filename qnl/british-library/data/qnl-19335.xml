Enclosed with Anderson’s letter is letter no. 9 of 1855 from Major Atkins Hamerton, Her Majesty’s Consul and the Honourable Company’s Agent in the dominions of His Highness the Imam of Muscat, addressed to Anderson, dated 19 March 1855. In his letter Hamerton writes that he doubts remonstrances made to Shaikh Mahommed bin Ali [Muḥammad bin ‘Alī] of Jaalan will make any difference, as those tribes under his nomimal control are Wahabees [Wahhābī] and believe they have a right to plunder any vessels in distress along the coast.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x00002e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
