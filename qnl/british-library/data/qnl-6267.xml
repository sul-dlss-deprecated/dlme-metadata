(received under hr Consul crow's endorsement No 1 dated 11th January 1913}British Consulate, //^ Basrah^January 1913. With reference to previous correspondence on the subject of the refusal of the Authorities at Basra to permit the registration of land and house property in the names of Sfteikh Mubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah I have the honour to report as follows:* A telegram has been received from Constantinople by the Vilayat to the effect that the services of Sheikh Khazal and Sheikh Mubarak are highly esteemed by the Govern ment and that the Sultan is pleased with them* The acting Wali, Ali Reza Pasha, on receipt of this telegram sent Ahmed Nais Bey to Fail!eh to inform the Sheikhs but, as they were absent, he has decided to communi cate the message to them by letter. As regards the question of Sheikh Khazal it will be re membered that, in the time of Suleiman Nazif Bey, the tapoo office were instructed by Constantinople not to register any property in Sheikh Khazal # s name. More recent instruc tions have been received by this Department, allowing the Sheikh to acquire property in houses and shops and I hear that Sheikh Khazal has now begun to purchase hocuses. I am informed that after Hassan Reza Bey, former Wali, left Basra, Sheikh MubaraK wrote to the Vilayat asking why his land purchases were not allowed to be registered in his His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir G.A.Lowther, G.C.MG.,C.B., etc etc*name. He stated that he had rendered feood service to the Ottoman Government in the time of Midhat Pasha, former 7/ali of Baghdad, by going to Hasa and driving Bin Baud out of that district and that he had always paid his taxes and given pecun iary assistance to the Government. He urged that the author ities should not suppose that he bought the land for other people as they could do so themselves and it was unreason able to Imagine that they wanted his assistance. He ashed for a clear statement of the objections to his purchases. I am informed that Sheikh Khazal also wrote to the Vilayat in similar terms, seating that he preserved good relations with the local authorities and often captured run away criminals and returned them to Basra. He asked for the reasons of their refusal to the registration of his land. Both Sheikhs requested that instructions might be issued permitting the registration of property in their respective names. The administrative council discussed the matter and decided to support the requests of both Sheikhs informing the Minister of the Interior that there was no objection to regis ter the lands acquired by Sheikhs Mubarak and Khazal in their respective names and pointing out that Sheikh Mubarak had given £T 500 towards the relief of the sufferers in the fire at Con stantinople and £T3000 to the war fund during the Turco-Italian war, and that Sheikh Khazal had given £T 400 to the Turco-It- alian war^and £T 300 during the present war. Ali Heza Pasha the present acting Wall wired on his arrival here to the Min ister of the interior and confirmed the reports of his pre decessors, requesting that instructions might be sent as soon as possible to permit the registration of the lands of both Sheikhs• The matter was finally arranged satisfactorily through the medium of Seyyed Talib Bey.

Sir, I have Lhe honour to attach a oopy f oi‘ a letter re- -oeived from Husain Beg the Mudir at Fao, and to explain the matter with which it is connected. 2. The status of the cultivators and tenants stationed in the date groves of the Shaikh of Kuwait at Fao and other places seen 3 to be of two Kinds. There are those who have title deeds which entitle them to rights and privileges as set forth in those deeds, and there are those who are merely servants engagec •oemporarily on mhe understanding that their services can be dis- -penced with according to agreement. Of the latter class, ac- -cording to the informaoion which I have here, is one Jasim bin Munamuad Swwailih witn whom the Shaikh now desires to dispense. It appears that Jasim has enlistee the Mudir in his defence, anc that the latter is threatening the Snaixm's agent at Fao with 'severe punishment' in the event of his aeal^ng with Jasim “con- -trary to the rules and approval of Government', b. The ShaiKh objects to retain Jasim in his service on two grounds. Firstly that he is a aischief maKer who has given trouble on several occasions, and secondly because he refuses to give up one of His Excellency's horses which was committed to his charge during last Bummer according to custom. Mullahj&gt; ^Lfb @&gt; Mullah Salih the Chief Seoretary one of whose principal objeots is invariably to please us was ten years at Pao and knows Jasia to be a .aisohievous person. He assures .ne that there is every reason to get rid of him. 4. In regard to Lhe enolosea it is only neoessaxv to point; out that a oopy of Jasim'o title deeds oould have been sent without getting any other person into trouble with the Jvhaixth, and that I had asked the Mudir to send Jasim to .ae not to hand him over to the Shaikh’s agents. 5. Since the aoove was written Mullah Salih has come to me with a letter fx^om Mullah Muhammad describing how the Mudir came to him asking for countersignature to a copy of a document signify- -ing that Shaikh Jarrah had given to Muhammad Suwailih 100 date trees, and how he declined to sign remarking that tne copy had no original and amounted to a forgeyy. Mullah Salih assures me that this view is correct. 6. I strongly recommend the removal of this man from Pao with- -out any delay. I have the honour to be, Sir, four most obedient rervant, 7/,.

In order to reassure the EhaLih by dealing with this very serious matter without delay I left Kuwait the same evening by sailing toads vessel no steam ship being available, vie were some what delayed by contrary winds and only reached the telegraph station at Fao on the afternoon of the 15th. I then founn that Muha.amad Ataiji had left for Basrah on a summons from you, anu that the Mudir had likewise received orders to follow him but tha1 he had broxen his leg ana was confined to his bed. In these oir- -cumstancee there did not appear to be need for action by me, so after despatching certain important messages to you I returned to Kuwait. 4.

The Hon'ble the Political Reeident in the Persian Gulx &amp; Chief Political Officer, ^asreth. Sir, In continuation of .ay letter No. Cll dated lath inst. I have the honour, in support of His Excellency Shaikh Jabir, to naKe some further observations in connection with your re- -quest for the supply of labour aL Kuu-al- Farangi. 2. The first intimation of this asiistance being required froa us appears to have been conveyed in a memorandum to Abdur Itehim the Shaikh's representative at Fao dated 12th ^eoember last and signed by yourself, which Aodur kahim naturally referred to hie master for his orders. The dhahdi replied to him at onje, in a communication a co^y of which is before me, directing that the men should go, ana no time was lost in mustering them; but in a letter dated 19th December, a translation of which is attached, Abdur .3ahim describes how the Mudir delayed their departure. No such reply as that spoken of by the Mudir seems subsequently to have been received by him. 3. Ehaikh Jabir trusts that no idea of his having hesitated promptly to carry out the wishes of Government will be enter- -tained. His sole reason for desiring that I should matte this representation is to assure you that he has neither on tliii occasion, nor will he ever, fail to ao all that is required of tTranslax-ion oi a letter dated j5rd f^arar 1334 - 19th Lteoember 1915 from Abdur Rahim to ShaiKh Jabir. I had arranged lo send some men with Ibrahim ana Mulla Yaitub. some men fro a the southern i/ortLon ana some fx^om the ^tntral and .^aid to them go to Ataiji’e plaoe when your part^ will be oorapleted; and I ordered 'ohe ien of the northern por- -tion also (to go tnere) that their pa^'ty miglit be jompleted and all were to ga start from thenoe. In the morning the Mudir sent for me and I went to him in the Bungalow. He said 'Your northern portion men Hufarrij, Ali Safar, Dushman, and Yasin bin Muhammad a . Suwailih have begged me to interoede for them say- -ing that they are po^r men and not fit for this worK at this cold time; they beg that Government will exouse them, and if it is absolutely neoesmiy they will pay (instead) ana Government may provide other men instead of them” This is what the Mudir said and added that he interceded for mhem. This is how the matter stands; and the Muuir saiu that he has. informed basrau regarding his intercession for them, ana in^hallah Lhey will be excused by Government. Ana he said' the party which you have oruered to go should waiw now until an answer comes to my re- -ferenoe of intercession'. I replied that I am under Govern- -ment's orders, and will send or delay the men according to their wishes and I have no desire except to carry ouu mhe orders of Government and I ordered Ibrahim and dulla Yaicub mo wait, now all are in their places and we aw^it the Mudir's oraers. I inform y u of this. i^ I No. 3 POLITICAL OFFICE, BASRAH March 20th, 1916. To The Political Agent, Koweit. Memorandum Your No. C/13 dated 25th February© Since receiving it I have discussed the general question of the position of the Shaikh of Koweit f s cultivators at Fao with you: I think it well however to place on record, with reference to para 2 of your letter under reply that whilst in practice every endeavour will be made to maintain touch with Shaikh Jabir in regard to the affairs of his estates in the occupied territories, it must be remembered that the Shaikh is merely in the position of an absentee landlord and that so long as we do not treat his tenants differently to others, we are within our rights in declining to place him, as a landlord, or his property, on a different plane to others In any case it is incumbent upon the Shaikh’s agents on his’lands’ to give prompt effect to orders received from competent authority in the occupied territories without hesitating or referring to Koweit for orders. The somewhat unfortunate selection of the Fao Mudir has been a source of some difficulty which would otherwise have been avoided but thafstumbling block will shortly be removed and I hope we shall have no further trouble. Chief Political Officer.© ' l U -1 ' No. 'Z.-z.pg' Political Office, Basra, 20th March 1916 # To The Political Agent, Koweit• Memorandum, Please see your letter C-ll of 18th February. When deputing Major Mosse, Assistant Political Officer, Basra District, to visit the riverain villages between here and Fao, I instructed him to enquire into the quarrel between the Mudir and Mulla Mohamed, and I attach, for your information, a copy of his report on the subject* The Mudir has since been removed* It is evident, however, that Mulla Mahomed was also culpable^wv he took the law into his own hands and placed fyOL man under restraint without any authority* He will be addressed a warn ing accordingly. With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter under reply in which you speak of contemplating dealing with the matter yourself and subsequently^ of finding that there did not appear to be need for action by you, I think this decision must have been based on the same misapprehension of the position as that I am well aware that you went to Fao on this occasion solely in the interests of the service which it is the object of both of us to safeguard, but as Political Agent, Koweit, you have no status 7 in the absence of special delegation from me,to take action or deal with any matter arising ; in the Occupied Territories. In the event therefore of your finding it urgent in the interests of the Shaikh to proceed to Fao, please report your arrival there by telegraph immediately you land and take no action on shore pending receipt of authority from me. Chief Political Officer.Re. the Mudir of Fao &amp; Mulla Mahomed. C. P. 0. # 1. The first letter from the Mudir to Mulla Mahomed of which Col. Grey sent a copy referred to the case of one Hachim. When at Fao I sent for this man and interrogated him in the presence of the Mudir and Mulla Mahomed. He said that the latter had taken from him a piece of land for which he wanted R? 100/- but had paid him only 50/-. The Mudir had written to Mulla Mohamed to return the land to Hachim if he would not pay the full price. Mulla Mahomed said that Hachim had accepted the 50/- in payment. So far as Hachim was con cerned I settled the matter by making him return the 50/-, Mulla Mahomed agreeing to return the land. It was the tone of the Mudir’s letter to which Mulla Mahomed objected. 2. As regards his arrest of Mulla Mahomed the Mudir stated that the latter had imprisoned in his house a man who had given evidence against Mulla Mahomed in a land dispute, his relations came and complained to the Mudir who went to Mulla Mahomed’s house and found the prisoner, just released. He arrested Mulla Mahomed. I had up the alleged prisoner in t Mulla Mahomed’s presence, and he said that the latter had called him to his house, cursed him for opposing him, and kept him under restraint for two or three hours when he let him out on hearing the Mudir was coming. At Mulla Mahomed’s instance he swore to this on the Koran. Mulla Mahomed said they had had a dispute, but denied having detained the man by force; but from inquiries I made there is no doubt he did so. It is clear that the Mudir exaggerated the seriousness of what had occurred, and that he had no business to act as he did. I told hiajso and that if he had any cause of complaint against the Sheikh’s agent his duty was to report it for orders. I gathered that the Mudir and Mulla had been good friends until recently when for some reason they appear to have quarrelled, sincesince when each accuses the other of oppression and corruption* I had no time to make detailed inquiries, besides being v/ithout an • Interpreter until Naum arrived the day before I left Fao, and as I wanted to get them to work together to produce coolies, I made the Mudir and Mahomed shake hands and embrace. From what I could learn it seems to be a fact that Mulla Mahomed is given to 'Zulm', but I doubt the Mudir f s straightness, though he seems a man of ability and energy.• It is only to be expected that if the Sheikh’s agent is inclined to oppress people, he will complain against a Mudir who tries to interfere; but the Mudir of Fao under present conditions is subject to too little control and we want a man there whom we can trust, apart from the objections an ex- Turkish official in such a position. The Mudir should easily be able to travel by next mail, and might be ordered up here then. Sd. A.H.M., 11-3-16. I see from the file that the Mudir reported Mulla ^ahomed as having fired when he approached his house - he said nothing of this to me.^7^ Basrah, March 21st, 1916&lt; Mullah Mahomed, Fao.

In continuation of previous letter intimating the out-break of war between the British Government and Turkey, I am ordered by the British Government to convey to Your Excellency gratitiae for your loyalty and your offer of assistance, end to request you to attack Umm C^asr, Gafwan and Bubiyan and to occupy them. You should endeavour, afterwards, in co-operation with shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, Amir Abdul Aziz bin Baud and other reliable shaikhs to liberate Basrah from Turkish possession, ohould this prove to be beyond your ability, you should make arrangements, if possible, to prevent Turkish reinforcements from reaching Basrah or even Qurnah, until the arrival of the British troops whom we shall send, please God, as soon as possible. I also hope that two of our men-of war will reach Basrah before the arrival of your troops there. And though it should be your highest aim, in this connection, to liberate Basrah and its people from Turkish rule, still we request that you should use your utmost endeavour in preventing troops and others from plundering the merchandise belonging to British merchants in Basrah nun its dependencies, to protect the European residents of Basrah and to safeguard them from loss and oppression. In return for your valuable assistance in this important matter, I am ordered by the Britidi Government to promise to Your Excellency that if we succeed therein - and we shall succeed therein, please God, - we will not return Basrah to the Turkish Government and we will not surrender it back to them at all. FurthermoreFurthermore I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally viz.:- (1) that your gardens which are now in your possession, viz*, the date gardens situate between Fao and fyirnah shall remain in your possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes. (2) that if you attack Safwan, Umm C^asr and Bubiyan and occupy them the British Government will protect you from any consequences arising from that action* (3) that the British Government does recognise and admit that the Sheikhdom of Kuwait is an independent Governmaat under British protection* I certify that the above is the true copy of an extract from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf’s letter dated ard November 1914 to fahaikh ilubarak as Subah, Ruler of Kuwait.

From J. H. Bill, F.sq., I.C S., First Assistant Resident, In charge cu rent duties, To — Sir Louis Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, 451, dated 20th August i 9 o 7 . a C °W of the letter noted in the margin, with enclosure on the subject of Sheikh Mubarak’s latest grievance against the Turks, in connection with his recent purchase of a date garden. The reference to this purchase contained in Political Agent, Koweit s No. 375, dated 14th July 1907, a paraphrase of which was com municated to Government by the Political Resident in his telegram No. 6, Shiraz, dated 29th July 1907, was purely incidental and identical with the entry in the Koweit Diary quoted by Major Knox, which in turn will be found as paragraph 1489 of the Political Diary of this Residency. 2. There can be little doubt, I imagine, that this incident has weighed with the Sheikh in the negociations at present pending on the subject of Bunder Shweikh to a degree scarcely justified by its intrinsic importance ; and I would venture, with great respect, to suggest that its effect may be expected to be, in some degree at least, transient, and that the present moment is therefore pecu liarly advantageous for the conclusion of the negociations in question. 3. Enquiries will be made by the earliest opportunity from His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, on the subject of the incident now reported, and the prospect of Sheikh Mubarek’s obtaining redress in any form. No. 451, dated Koweit, the 20th August 1907 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, I.a., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. C I have the honour to forward, herewith, the true copy and translation of a letter received by me from Sheikh Mubarak, in which he states that he has been prevented from purchasing the land in the Wilayat of Basrah, referred to in my Diary No. 29 for the week ending 17th July 1907, and again in paragraph 5 of my confidential letter No. 375, dated the 14th July 1907, to the First Assistant to the Resident, Bushire, 2. The Sheikh’s letter is studiously moderate in tone, far more moderate than the terms in which he informed me of the event when he alluded to that “ deceitful rotten Turkish Government.” He said that when he asked for his money back, he was told that the earnest money had gone to Sheikh Sadun-ul- Muntafich, but that the Turkish authorities would write and ask him for it. This, the Sheikh seemed to regard, as adding insult to injury. He showed me a letter from His Excellency that arrived with the news of the incident under report, in which the Turkish authorities asked for a further payment of revenue for the Fao lands in advance. 3. However undesirable it may be for the Sheikh to give hostages to fortune by making large purchases of immoveable property in Turkish territory, I believe that there is a Turkish regulation authorising the free sale and purchase of landed property subject to registration, and it is difficult to see how His Excellency the Wali of Basrah can justify his action in refusing to sanction the sale. 4. Moreover, it would appear that the incident might be made use of as showing a tendency on the part of the local Turkish authorities to regard Sheikh Mubarak as an undesirable alien ; Sheikh Mubarak looks to us for support in this matter on which he feels very strongly, and it would seem doubtful whether the supreme authority at Constantinople would approve of the very impoliticaction of their Fasrah subordinate in alienating and unjustifiably alienating stil further the sympathies of an influential personage like Sheikh Mubarak. Per sonally, I am inclined to regard His Excellency’s action as playing into my hands, but, if he could be compelled to sanction the sale, ostensibly owing to British recommendation but really from the Sublime Porte’s desire to stand well with the local Chiefs, it would add to our prestige and influence in this part of the country.

Dear Mr. Bill, ,v&gt; \ In reply to your enquiries ot August 27th, beptemoer 17th and September 26th, regarding the purchase by bheiidi Muoarek cl land at Umm—el—Garb, I have to state as follows:- The Vali assures me that the registration of the sale wks stopped not on account of Sheikh Mubarek but of ^adun Pasha. His Sxcellency informed Sheikh Mubarek of this at the time through Abdul T.'ahab el Kartas, and the Sheikh wrote to the '• aj.1 thanking him for his explanation and stating enat he. nad v/itnarawn from the purchase. The Vali says no fees were paid by Mubarek. The plot of ground Umm-el-Garb is below *ain. It seerns boat the earnest money has been returned to Mubarek. The Vali knew nothing about the sale at the time. The Memcur ol one Tapoo took the application for registration to the Vali, who reported the matter to Constantinople for permis sion to complete the transaction. Permission mas refused, as the authorities do not want to strengthen Sadun Pasha's nands by allowing him to increase his revenue, and sc ■one transfer was brought to a standstill.

Yours sincerely, (sd) P. /t Cox.Basra January 24th 1^03. I/Iy dear Cox, ^ t\ \ four telegrarn January 12 and letter January 14 about Hubaret’s land at Vali says to oblige us he will do his best to smooth over difficulties provided no ham is done to the fort but he states liubareh is reclaiming new ground and not merely repairing old seddas as represented. He has recovered this year from the river 53,000 square dras (that means a patch of about 150 yards, the land dra being 13 inches) on the ITorth side of the fort, and opened a channel besides near tne fort itself. Before land is reclaimed from a river in Turhey it is usual to obtain permission from Grovernment and pay something for it. This has not been done. The matter is engag- -ing the attention of the Palace and they are in cor respondence with the Vali on the subject. The Vali has replied to the Palace telegrams' that ne is mating the necessary enquiries. The whole question has been re ferred by the Vali to the administrative council and he proposes to send a member of the Council to rao to survey the £&gt;lace. The Vali will let me hear further when the matter has been gone into. I suggested privately that Vali should tell me how much royalty tne Turkish Government wanted as I might then be able to facilitate matters and Mubareh would do well to consult tne Vali direct as to permis sion and payment. His statement to us seems disingen uous. I am a little embarrassed by liubareh himself, who during the feast (January 14 to 13) began his wort again in spite of orders not to and would pay no atten -tion to what the Turkish Government said. Your teleg ram to me was dated January 12, so Jiubareh toos the law intointo his o^vn hands two days at out after your reference to me. He is' really an 'impossitle client'! that is the Arabic of your translation '600 metres clear space'. I fancy there may be some error. Our surface measure here is the 'dra' which is l n inches. There is a lineal dra of 36 inches but used for cloth only. The metre is not used locally for land measure, though, if measured by the military people, the 600 ? in the perimeter of the fort may well be.the metre as we tnow it. I will do what I can.lut you see it isn’t easy under existing conditions. Tours Sincerely, (sd) *.l].

With reference to the first reason,Sheikh Mobara^ claims tnat tne limits of \he ^oi't were laid down long ago in writing in his possession and that ne has no iuiov^ledge wh these lii.ji.t 3 have been enlarged and that he has been given no opportunity of representing his- the proprietor's- views and It would appear tnat tne lands on which tailsreceived no corapena.-vtion for tihis clearance 0 vfhich v/onli render desolaoe -x l^ive portion of his land* 4.

As regards the third reason* it vtould be in teresting to learn when Sheikh I lobar an received clear official instructions that he was not to build the exabanktaents and even If he did do so contrary to orders,he may* ulead that it is impossible to obey such orders, as he ccannot stand by and see his property f r o to nin for want of proter rev tir.H/is constant complaint to ae is that the Purks vrill not allow him to exercise the right that each and every one /r the meanest proprietor on the river- has viz: to protect his property against the devastation not only of the river as in the case of more fortun ute proprietors higher up river but also of the sea. o # it is perhaps worth noticing that tne haim Itokam of ^ao,thu higae 3t local civil .authority , is apparently on Sheikh Hobarakfs side in this affair.7.

The Sheikh maintains that he has all the subordinate officials on his side and that his onl^ obstacle is His Excellency who wishes to extort none' from him. 4. The Sheikh* s proposals appear#on the surface f eminently reasonable.He states nhat all he requires is an enquiry by a representative com mission of Basra notables at which be suggests that His Excellency#himself an t the Basra Consul should be present,either in person or by deputy.He states that he is quite ready to abide by the finding of that commission but that even if it decrees that the land is#as it is called,i^ash, i.e.reclaimed land# he claims the right enjoyed by all riparian owners to pay a fixed sum for the privilege of re clamation and to be permitted thereafter to enjoy it in peace.Bheikh I'obaruc, even goes further and say's that# while utterly* deny ing the reclamation, at least within the past 14 years, he will# for the 3axe of peace and quietness admit,without enquiry that the land is l^ash and pay the fees claimedtBut he asixs that trds should be done speedily to avoid further injury to the land#This last was in ansv/er to my suggestion that it v/ould be as well to av/ait the reply of the British Government to the repre sentations already made by him and forwarded by yourself. 5. Considering the grave importance that the Sheikh attaches to this question# and his evi dent determination to pub this difficutlty forward as a stop to all our negotiations with him# I have the honour to propose a visit by my self accompanied by some representative of the Sheikh to Pao to ex amine the condition of the broken embankments com plained of anithe amouxit of injury likely to be caused thereby.This would,in the natural course#befollowed a visit* ‘bo Basra*where I could, ohrough H.M f 8 Gonsul at Basra#place t*he iaabber be .'ore His Excellency and endeavour t*o effect* some sort* of settlement, even if only a temporary 7 one#pending the reconsideration of the question or, at least, obtain from His Excellency some definite statement of tiie reasons or regulations,owing ’co which H,E # has for^- bidden the repair of chase embankments, d.

He says that it rims in a continuation - in terrupted however by a cre^u- - and to the north ofthe fort embankment ; and that , when the fort was built , he and the fort authorities combined amicably to embank or repair embankments together . xie sa„ s that , since that date , ££ ^ears ago he has carried out ^earl^ smd even more frecuent repairs , as occ- * as ion demanded , to the embankment and his men have never been interfered with until now . Tn support of this contention , he has proauced (£&gt; copies of certain correspondence which took place in the earl w part of the „ear between his hxcellenc., the T ali of i^asra and the haim-mokam of jao • It must be said that these do not appear to be official copies , but the., were probably furnished b^ the .waim-mokam of x*'ao to the Sheikh . Sheikh Mobarak explains that certificated copies of Turkish records are not pro curable • In that correspondence , the .xaim-mokam corroborates the destructiorjb^ night of the embank ment b^ Turkish soldiers - in itself a sufficiently lawless and high-handed proceeding , for which it would too much to demand the punishment of the officer commanding the fort -and the bheikh^s state ment that the embankment is an old one • The letters of the .^aim-mokam also indicate that the the cultivation to the fort is the reason why the embankment was destroyed • A Turkish Oommision 9 composed of the following members , The commander of the Turkish corvette The Aaim-mokam of Tao A Yus-bashi from j^asra sat on the cuestion . Y 0 howeit representative was present , according toSheikh Mobarak . The embankment had not been repaired after t^e damage done to them by the Turkish soldiers and have not been repaired yeC The oomm^sion expressed the opinion that there wa~ no necessity to interfere with the embankments , but that they obstructed the view from the fort and that'7 i i crA, ‘ “ J° /r future repairs should not be executed 2^ ( vide^Political Agent’s letter no:*^ dated f/f/ 08 to the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf ) • was surprised at the time Sheikh Mobarak informed me of the decision that he made no attempt to have this order cuestioned , but it would seem that the Goramision were not unanimous and that the views of the military member on the purely militar^ cuestion carried the da^ against his two colleagues who were not disposed to agree with him • fhe Sheikh was apparently awaiting the end of his correspondence with His LxcellenCy the T ali of uasra • The ambiguous letter from His -LxcellenCy already referred to above dated 51st i.iarch (copy and transla tion forwarded with m^ letter no: 181 dated l')th April) seems to have roused Sheikh Mobarak to further exertions and he wrote asking the Political Resident to protect him in the enjOy ment of his rights under date 8th April 1908 , forwarded with niy no: 181 dated 15th April 1^03 . ^ The Sheikh now seeks to upset the finding of that Com mission and to that end recuires the appointment of a fresh Commission of .uasra notables .

Inwaihi Lish- -uan lei us a little way inland and we made our ?fay over three or four separate blocks of date gardens ^each divided from the other by a creek. We worked down the last creeiL to the river again and at the point where creeic and river mot found oitrselves in a rough open enclosure where there v;ere perhaps a lozen retainers of Bhelkh Ilo'jibarajs: all fully armed.I asked for the headman and tvro men presented themselves.One was Badar bin v Huhawaad ash Bhatfa^L who had just been relieved of his charge and the relief was Brahia bin Abdul Jabbi^K who said tiiat no was at the head of 30 men. 6. I was informed that the quarrel arose over a small piece of land at the outlet of the &gt;©(^176 0PiilL,fhis 0VMi» looiiod a3 if it, htd baan abraighfe- -ened out, and had ourled southwards but auch 1 md as had beon ancloaad hi thia pro cess was of verf maall extent Find was unculti- vated#i3ven if pTOP^rly reclaikiad and fenced in, it could not have contained a dozen date trees* Frcua thence, I crossed the ere eh into the Ha* aiitir pronert# to see if v/e could find art of the &amp;a f - -amir cnxltivators to see v/hat thet would saj' on the subject*There were no indications on their side of an armed detachment and we only saw three unarmed men, two of whom vrere on the oppo site side of the next creek and positively dis claimed all knowledge of the dispute*The third man who came up at the moment we persuaded to accompany us to the spot previously indicated but he Uso absolutely refused to coimit himself to Kxy any statement of the causes of quarrel, much less to ills view of the Fao Ka*amir bound- -aiy .Cur stay at tills spot could not have ex ceeded ten minutes and I embarked again vfonder- ing why so very’ small and worthless a piece of ground should have occasioned such blttWW q i ,reli ving.! was informed that the %nmm creek on which the 'letachment was posted was called Nahor- -i&gt;Moosa bin Karauk al Ab'Jadi. 6. It ms not long that I was permitted to remain in this state of doubt*In the course of my .stay at Fao, I was assured by the local gossip that it was an open secret that the creek on which trie detachment was posted was not trie ••Nalvxr i I'oosa' but the 'Nahar i Ghath-ban' and that Sheikh Hobaru; has taken from the Ha , aimir property and added to liis own a large oloox of % ' date garden probably 1CX) yards olde and stretch ing from the river on the east side to the mar shes on the west.Which version is tho true one• *it is difficult to but there is no doubt &gt; l f j that a large tract of extremely valuable and well cultivated land is in dispute and it ./ill be necessary to move with extreme caution before we lend our support to what may quite likely be a piece of serious lav/less aggression* 7* I next proceeded dovm river and landed at the Telegraph buildings and delivered a letter from the Quarani ine officer at Basra to the quarantine officer at ^ao«As I had no motive for concealment, I expressed a v/ieh to see the Kaim Hokam but it was midday and he was taking his siesta. 8. I again embarked and we want down stream to the house of Abdur liahim bin Haji iiashid who is Sheikh 1 lobar ik 1 u principal Pao absent cuid an inhabitant of this part of the country .Here we v/ere met by the news that Abdur iiahlm vraa out and would not be bacn till sunset, so I despatched my chuprassi Hamad with a local man to go by land to the Has an Nabt,the extreme southern end of the T^ao properties,v/here Abdur riahlza was stated to be,while we proceeded thither by sea, so that we could catch him on his return .journey whether by see or 1 uid. 9. I was now accompanied by the Telegraph naivhoda one Yasin but we failed to find Abdur Hahim who had left a little be Tore Yasin in the dinghy reached his objective. 10. Yfe then returned a short way upriver and proceeded to a house N.of the Turkish fort v/hich was said to overlook the land in dispute between Sheikh ilobarah and the military authorities of the Tao fort.This house belonged to Ahmed bin Bisq^of ./horn mention has already been made in the correspondence relating to Harba island^ and here I ,ms^;rith the usual Arab ho suit lity^ piomut^ymade welcome • As we ‘proceeded wout/wards up the little craei; bounded on either ,iide roeclSf muihoda Yaein pointed out to me the bi'ol.on bund and, informed me that it had been constructed in C (X ~m VA hours by 1000 laen of *&gt;rhOH 500 aesao frou the t Persian side of the rlver»while the soldiers were afraid to interfere. 11. Tae Arabs-and there were a matter of a do 3 on or so at Ahmed bin iiizq^ house-informed me that#in their positionjthey were between tho devil and the deep aea and were at their wits * ends to iuaovr what to to .If they carried out Bheikh llobarah’s orders,they incurred the liouti lity of the -'‘ort soldiers and, if they did not, tuey ntd Sheith Hobart punishir.’ -m.A garden, overlapping Altmed bin hiisq’s date garien and house to the north^was enclosed anti pi uxted, so X ascert-vined »atnin the last six years according to one account and v/ithin t3i6 last tnree y ears according to another*fhe significance of this will appear later* 12. We had been sitting in Ahmed bin Hisq f s date garden a matter of 20 minutes when Sheikh Motoanfc 1 * agent, Abdur liahim. arrived, we ins- -pected the ground enclosed by the offending embankment*Abdur Rahim infonne d mo that t.ne foundations of the old embankment were laid fourteen years ago but that nothing had been done subsequently until last autumn when txie whole amb-ouaaent was oonstnxoted in one day'*it was destroyed in the winter and had not been repaired* 13* The ground enclosed to the east of Ahmed bin Risers house has never been cultivated and thouffn it Mould no toubt, be sactr—alg valu4ble» ^ A an inspaot^ioii of tha ipo% 1* quitre sufricient tx&gt; A3at»i3fjr ar$ reasonable person notching of greater value bh'^n reeda lia s been 'oaken out# of it# up to date.I an* as a nilit#ary loan* ant#irely in aympaW with the local uilitai^ authorities in forbidding its cultivation.No soldier viould per mit it for a noraent.That, at the saue time* the fort also is entirely valueless either for att-aon; or defence is perhaps beside the quest ion. It appears to me extremely doubtful whether the embrinkiaenb was t-ver erected before last aTitunn and Ab iur fiahin 1 s statement is valuable as showing that Sheilih llobarak has not stead! 1^ ? been repairing the embankment tnree or four times per annum for the last fourteen years* The embankuent stretching from Ahmed bin ^iizq’s house to the ^trt# craei^ which does protect a dvt#e garden is sound and in good repair and no one ever attempted to maintain that the Turkish soldiers touched it. 14. The inspection of the ground also dis proves another wild statement of Sheikh Hobarak*s viz:that if the ‘^ort garrison fired northwards they would be firing into the Telegraph build ings and inhabited villages .The Poid# fire is masked on the west and on the v/est only.Ho rifle bullet could carry to cultivated or inhabited gi'ound either north, east or south.Within rifle range trie re is nothing except liax dreary swamp Icuid from whio^ )iowevor y tne rivur is race ling and which will be potentially valuable for date cultivation purposes after no very' gi’eat lapse of time. 15. I was lust getting up to leave when the Yusbashi from the '^ort came up to Almied bin i” ftisq 1 b house and we sat and talked through an interpreter for a quarter of an hour.;jy the B --MMcourt#©sy of thia gen*tlaBaaii# X was permitted lo proceed along ‘tde bund of AjiLiod bin xiinq. bo btia Porb ci^ek 'tbougli he woul d rsob give iuio pe mi salon bo enbar t#he ''orb which indeed 1 had nob for.He explained bo iue vfhab blie quarrel had been at a mb and 'raid b itb ; vhile bhey ti :l nob oo- jocb bo bh© aobual enclosure if ib was bhoughb lr n a ivia Xie bo enclose bids uioce u^rel^ a -1 jx A additional pro ovation agadnab flood water* bhey could nob permit its oulbivabion in ruiy shape or form.We returned bo the xi.I.i ..S.

To suxu tiPf’ohe position is briefly thus. It is quite a question v/hether HheilJi I lob iVjjl has or has not comultted a serious a^cgression involving valuable rrorert; to the north of his estates. In this a voter v/e have no * osaible juris diction or ■oretext for Interference and the matter appears one entirely for the Turkish courts to settle. 18. To the south,no real damage has been done at all.Sheikh Mobarak has erected a bund round vrhat Is at present vrorthless marsh 1 and and tne Turkish soldiers have destroyed it and for a very good reason too. The question of right is at best obscure and it is certainly ' ossible to ar.me that Turkish law all that 1 uid belongs to tne Ottoiaan irovanuient ,Tldoh permits or refuses to permit re cl ovation., as it thiniis fit. From, the Sheikh’s letters one would imagine that his estates were into gradually passing over/fcb^i the hands of the Turks.This is not so, it is a question of fresh acquisitions which the Turks refuse to permit him to acquire.In many directions,notably a strip of land to the north of the Telegraph buildings and the gardens to the north of Ahmed bin Rinq’s house they appear to have been very generours to him and to have foregone reclamation taxes which they might# in all l awfulness have claimed. Owing to the constant silting up of the river at the month,the Fao estates are sure to be a fruitful source of quarrels in the future and it seems hardly IDiely that r any v wveruiaent, v-Tith any” pretentions to law or civilisation# will accept#witnout liiait ation,3heilJi iiobarak* a claim that his boundary is the river and that#£ as it receds.hia 03tat©3 follow it without io wq a | y. aBiwed of an^'' body# j Tbo counsel of perfection, would be to have ihe whole estate carefully’ surveyed &lt;Jid a record of rights rre^ared md clear lec-1 opinion ob tained a 3 to what the law in tne QtXiOn n doiai- nions really is on u/J.s subject of alluvial lands Throughout 103 ex.i-iuination of the case,! have been greatly iiaprested with the extreme courtesy shewn me by all the Ottojuan officials 1 have iwet an 1 the general conclusion I have 001.18 to is that at the uouth of the Shatt el Arab# the T^ir— Lish (lovetTuuent stands in Quite as luiioh need of protection against SheiLh Hobarsui# as Blieikh Mobarah does against Turkish aggression* 19.

Politic al Agent #i-Oowreit#Sir, British Consulate’ Basra July 25,1908 In compliance with your request, I have tne nonour to report tnat on tne 17th instant, I interviewed Tahir Pasha, Commandant of Basra, on the subject of Shaikh Mubaiifc :’s claims at Pao. He entirely confirmea the Vail’s assertion that this was l»y a military question. He maintained that the Government had a perfect right not only to mace good their present claim out also to expropriate a consideraoiy larger portion of Moi?a- -rak’s property, of wnicn he possessed no title deeds. The land in the proximity of the Port is said oy the’.Turks to have oeen originally suomerged and unfit for cultivation and when the water retires all such land is claimed as Government property. He suggested that if the Sheikh proven recalcitrant in the matter the claims of the Government might oe very largly increased. With regard to the destruction of the ” ound” the Commandant informed me that only two sides had oeen overthrown. These had Major 3.C.Knox political AgentDtsan nd^ly arreted and mterferrad Arith the efficiency of tne iA. fort, oeing well within the circle ^ith a radios of 250 motres^ which nad oeen deemed necessary for tne maintenance of the position. In spite of this the Military Autnorities had at present.no in- -tention of asserting any claim to the lands oenind the Fort, although they lay within this zone. Tanir Pasha considers that it is quite impossible for the Government to reduce their demanoi ? wnich ne believes are eAtremoly moderate and reasonable. He also % says that very little injury has been inflicted on tne Sheikh’s lands, the partial destruction of the new bund only affecting the enclosure of a barren uncultivated strip, to tne ownership of wnich Mubarak //as never entitled.

Put nord horley agrees with the Government of India as to the desirability, on political grounds, that a Committee should be appointed, in accordance with the Sheikh’s desire, for the final settlement of the matter in dispute; and he would suggest for Sir E. Grey’s consideration that the Forte should be approached accordingly. As regards the constitution of the proposed Conn ittee, Lord 2orley is of opinion that the presence of a British Cfficer would be advai tageous, and he desires to support the Government of India’s sug estion that the British Co, sul at Basra should be nominated for the purpose. I am also to forward copies of correspondence received by mail from I ndia on t he 28t h ultimo as to the attitude of the Sheikh. 3 have etc, (sd) Colin G. Campbell.

Section l). j closing correspondence on the subject of a dispute which has arisen between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Turkish authorities in regard to his property at Fao. Pre vious correspondence on the subject has been forwarded to His Majesty’s Embassy in the confidential print. A somewhat analogous case to the present arose in 1902 in con nection with a lawsuit respecting this property. On the occasion in question the Sheikh appealed for British protection and represent ations were made at Constantinople which resulted in the issue by the Ottoman Government of instructions to the Wali of Bussorah to propose arbitration, which, on the intervention of the British Resi dent, the Sheikh accepted. Thereupon the Wali was notified that the arbitration would be conducted under the supervision of His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, who would be consulted at all stages of the pro ceedings, and attend the sittings of the Court. Mr. Grow was able to report in September 1903 that an amicable compromise had been effect ed, in virtue of which Sheikh Mubarek was recognised as the sole owner of the property at Fao. I have to request that your Excellency will propose a similar procedure to the Ottoman Government in the present instance, unless you should see any objection. Your Excellency should, however, use your discretion in the selection of a suitable moment for making this suggestion. I am etc. (sd) E.

To With reference to your letter No.54, dated the 1st February 1909, regarding the rebuilding of Sheikh Mobarak's embankment at Fao, I have the honour to request that you will, if possible, ascertain how Sheikh Mobarak was enabled to re build the embankment under such auspicious cir cumstances, and that you will inform me if his dispute with the Turks on this subject can now be considered settled or merely in abeyance. 2. As you are aware, H. M* s Ambassador at Constantinople has been directed to urge 'the Tur kish authorities, at a suitable moment, to settle this matter by arbitration. It is therefore of great importance that he should have early and accurate information as to any developments that may occur. 3. It would seem best for Sheikh Mobarak’s interests that he should give us his complete confidence in the matter. Unless he does so, it is extremely difficult for us to act effectively for him. Perhaps you will be able to persuade him to see the matter in this light. I have the honour to be Sir Captain, First Assistant Resident.

I do not find myself quite sharing the apprehensions ex pressed in paragraph 3 of your letter. Sheikh Mubarek specifical ly requested us to assist his interests by endeavouring to have a Commission (to be attended by a British Officer) appointed for the investigation and equitable settlement of the Embankment question. I see no sufficient reason why we should hesitate to remind him of that fact in a friendly way and add that he will no doubt realise the importance of keeping us accurately posted in regard to any developments that may be taking place, in order that His Majesty’s Ambassador may be informed and thus enabled to shape his representations accordingly. I feel sure that Sheikh Mubarek has sufficient common sense to appreciate that aspect of the question. In any case we are entitled to presume that he has without in-r discretion. But I opine that if adroitly approached he will readily respond, and I request you, if one has not already oc curred, to take an early opportunity of mentioning the matter.

In continuation of the correspondence ending with my letter No. 288, dated 30th January 1910, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of the marginally noted letters on the subject of Shaikh Mubarak’s Fao properties, and of Shaikh Mubarak’s recent meet- (1) Letter No. C.-ll, dated 6th (received 15th) March 1910, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian A Gulf. (2) Letter No. 14, dated 9th (received 15th) March 1910, from His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti- nople. ing with the Wali of Basrah in connection therewith. 2. The account of his trip given by Shaikh Mubarak to Captain Shakespear is very different from that given in Mr. Crow’s report. I have furnished Captain Shakespear with a copy of Mr. Crow’s report and asked him to make further enquiries about the matter. It is, however, sufficiently evident that the Shaikh’s emphatic statement that “ not one word had been broached on the subject of his properties ” is not in accordance with fact. No doubt, however, the Shaikh does not for a moment think that we believe such assurances. 3. It is evident from Mr. Crow’s report that the new Wali of Basrah is trying to ingratiate himself with Shaikhs Kbazal and Mubarak. It does not seem desir able from our point of view that the two chiefs should become too friendly with His Excellency, and I have asked His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah to be so good as to let me know if anything further transpires. It is very possible that Shaikh Khazal finding himself in opposition to the Bakhtiari (and most powerful) element in the Persian Government, may desire to make friends with the Turks, but it hardly seems likely that Shaikh Mubarak being on such friendly terms with Bin Saud could seriously contemplate any arrangement with the Turks. In fact, it seems possible that Shaikh Mubarak is merely trying to throw dust in the eyes of the Wali. 4. It appears that nothing was actually settled regarding the registration of the Fadaghia property, and in fact that no immediate settlement is likely. Any further information received will at once be reported to Government. ill No. C.-ll, dated Kuwait, the 6th March 1910. From—C aptain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To The First Assistant in charge of Residency, Bushire. / I have the honour to report the following further particulars witt reference to the correspondence ending with my letter, No. C.-7, dated the 18th January 1910, and my diary entries for February regarding Shaikh Mubarak s recent visit to Fao and Basrah. 2. In conversation the Shaikh mentioned his visit to Fao, said that he had met the Wali there, and had then gone on to Basrah in his yacht, stayed a few days at Shaikh Khazal’s palace in Basrah and returned. On my enquiry whether anything bad passed during the meeting as to the registration of his properties, he informed me with unusual emphasis that not a word had been broached on the subject, which was still in the position already reported in my letter referred to above. He added that the Wali had come down the river on tour and as he visited bis estates at Fao he felt bound to be present. 3. The above gives the Shaikh’s version, but I heard on excellent authority what I believe to be more in consonance with the real facts, from an intimate friend of the Shaikh. The Wali, intending to visit Fao, summoned Shaikh Mubarak, and the latter left Kuwait in haste in the middle of his preparations for his cam- naien against the Ajman tribe. Calls were exchanged between the Shaikh and the Wali on board their respective vessels, and the Shaikh was also entertained at adinner by the Wali. What passed between them exactly I am not aware, but the subject of the registration of bis properties certainly came up and was settled sum marily by the Wali refusing even to discuss the question until Mubarak should first take out a Turkish nationality certificate. Subsequently the Shaikh went up to Basrah, and I am unable to say whether calls were again exchanged there, but I believe not, as I am informed that Shaikh Mubarak did not land at the serai (Government House) at Basrah. 4. It is significant that the Shaikh’s secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim, has been in Basrah some time now, though on what business I have no information, and that the Shaikh undoubtedly sought to deceive me as to what passed between him and the Wali. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to ask if he can furnish any further light on the subject. (Copy.) No. 14. Basrah ; March §th 1910. Sir, I have the honour to report that last month the Wali and the Commodore pro ceeded in the “ Marmaris ” to Fao and met Shaikh Mubarak and Shaikh Khazal at the house of Abdul Wahab el Kartass at Saraji a few miles from Basrah. The company were entertained at a banquet at which the proceedings were enlivened by the Turkish band. After the meal Abdul Wahab, the host, made a speech which has been reproduced in a local Arabic newspaper the “ Izhar-ul-Hakk.” The speaker after congratulating the Ottoman nation on acquiring freedom and a constitution, said no people had ever done so without gradually progressing to the attainment of the highest happiness, glory and prosperity, and he was convinced Turkey would do the same. He then declared that certain dishonest officials in the past, in order to serve their own ends, had succeeded in estranging Shaikh Mubarak Pasha, Kaimmakam of Kuwait, from his country and bis Government and went on to eulogise the Shaikh in the following terms “ Who is Shaikh Mubarak Pasha as Sabah ? He is the free, faithful and zealous Ottoman now among us. Excellencies, we all know him well, and I need not detain you with an account of the Shaikh or his family, whose generous qualities have gained notoriety from the books of Midhat Pasha, the founder of our freedom, while more recently the Shaikh himself has become famous for the lavish manner in which he has contributed both money and assistance, as is attested by the official records of the Government.” The speaker concluded bis address “ by attesting to the fact that throughout the course of past events and vicissitudes, the Shaikh has never wavered or changed in his allegiance and fidelity to the Ottoman Government and nation,” and ended by saying “ Long life to Shaikh Mubarak and our beloved neighbour, Sardar Arfa Khazal Khan, who, although a Persian by nationality, conducts himself like an Ottoman in his acts .and contributes both efforts and money to the establishment of peace and good order in our dear native land and that more specially in the time of the present Wali. ” The party were then photographed, the Wali in the middle with Khazal on his right and Mubarak on his left, while the speaker, Kartass, stood in the foreground with bis back to the camera. I called a few days ago on the author of the speech, ’Abdul Wahab al Kartass who quite admitted that he had his tongue in his cheek when he delivered it. Mr. Lyle of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., who visited the Shaikh at Kuwait shortly after his trip to Basrah, informed me that Mubarak had told him that theA\ali still refused to allow the registration of the transfer of the land he had pur chased at Fadaghia unless he took out a certificate of Ottoman nationality. Abdul W ahab Pasha, however, gave me a somewhat different account of the matter. According to him, strict orders have been received from Constantinople not to per mit the registration of the transfer to Mubarak'at all. The reason for this oppo sition to what is really a very ordinary transaction is, so Abdul Wahab informs me, that a misconception exists at Constantinople regarding the situation of the land to be transferred, and that the Ministers believe it to occupy an important strategic position commanding Basrah, moreover, they do not think Mubarak is buying the land himself, but that the British Government are financing him in the matter. Abdul W ahab says the Wali had sent in very favourable reports, explaining how erroneous all this is, but he has not succeeded in overcoming the opposition of the Ministers. As regards the question of the nufus teskere, Abdul Wahab told me this matter could easily be got over by the Shaikh putting the land in the name of his blind son and taking out a certificate of Ottoman nationality for him in order to satisfy Turkish susceptibilities. I informed your Excellency in a previous despatch that Shaikh Mubarak proposed adopting this course when Major Knox and I discussed the matter with him last year at Kuwait. I do not myself think the Wali is as obligingly disposed to settle the question in the wuy the Shaikh suggests, as Abdul Wahab Pasha would have me believe.! As the deputy Ahmed Pasha asZobeir, the seller of the land, is at Constantinople, he could, no doubt, satisfy the Ministers as to the position of Fadaghia. I think they do not want to let Shaikh Mubarak acquire more ground here for purely political reasons, and the Wali, I think, is not likely to endeavour to induce them to change their minds as he fully appreciates the anomaly of the Shaikh’s position and loses no opportunity of having a dig at me about the Kuwait question. Your Excellency may have seen a statement in the Frankfurter Zeitung that Ahmed Pasha Zobeir had sold large tracts of land at Basrah to the British Government. An indignant denial of this was published by Zobeir’s brother, Abd-el-Mohsin, President of the Municipality, in the Basrah newspaper “Izhar-ul-Hakk,” but the statement, no doubt, refers to the present transaction and cannot but tend to increase Turkish suspicions. The Wali, how r ever, practises the Turkish maxim about being affable to one’s friends and dissimulating with one’s enemies, and I hear Shaikh Mubarak has promised to assist him to get the stone required for his new road by using Kuwait boats to bring the material from Maskat, no charge being made for freight, but the W T ali paying the cost of the labour employed. WTiether the Kuwait fisher men will approve of this onerous arrangement is another question. In any case the W 7 ali is cultivating good relations with his neighbours to some purpose and, as long as he continues on good terms with the powerful Shaikh of Muhammerah, it is unlikely there will be any armed disturbance in the Vilayet. There have been none of importance this winter. Early last month Falih es Seyhood, wffo is practically an outlaw, and who seems to have enlisted the good offices of Shaikh Khazal in order to effect a reconciliation with the Vali, came from Muhammerah where he has been staying to Basrah, and asked for pardon, saying he was ready to pay arrears of taxes due and to give up the rifles of his Arabs to the Turkish Government, to which he expressed his loyalty. The V ali com municated his application to the Minister of the Interior, but I have not heard with wffiat result. Falih returned to Muhammerah, the Wali having given him to understand that he would be arrested if he remained here longer than tw r enty-four hours. Shaikh Khazal has on his side reciprocated by maintaining a conciliatory attitude tbwards the Wali since his arrival and has not opposed the partial des truction of his house property on the Ashar creek road, which is included in the municipal scheme now being carried out by the W ali of widening the road and laying down a tramway to Basrah. Shaikh Khazal’s agent, Mirza Hamza, called on me and made some enquiries as to my own attitude in regard to the properties of the Bohra and Khoja communities on the road which were being partly pulled down. I told Mirza Hamza that I had been in correspondence with Constantinople on the subject, and His Majesty’s Embassy saw no reason to interfere with the execution of the Wali’s project, and that I had received instructions as to the4 limits within which the authorities could claim compliance with their designs without payment and the nature of the compensation which could be demanded under the regulations. The Shaikh’s agent took note of the date of the Building law, and I noticed that work was begun on his houses on the following day. s I have, etc., (Sd.) F. E. CROW.

(ii) The question of the embankment on the Sheikh’s Fao property. Assistant’s endorsement No. 725, dated the 20th March 1910. 2. It will be remembered I last reported the Sheikh as informing me that nothing had passed on the subject of the registration of his properties when he met the Wali of Basrah during his visit up-river in February. I have since received a copy of Mr. Consul Crow’s despatch No. 14 . dated the 9th March 1910, to His Majesty’s Ambassador which gives a vastly different account of what passed at the same meeting. After receiving it I took an opportunity of leading the Sheikh back to the subject, when the Sheikh surprised me by giving me an account much the same as Mr. Crow’s, apparently completely oblivious of its contradiction with what he had already tojd me. J rallied the Sheikh on Abdul Wahab-al-Kirtas’ speech at the banquet, and the Sheikh laughingly replied that such sentiments were the usual accompaniment of similar entertainments and were “ words.” They were useful as keeping the Turkish authorities pleased without being committal. 3. At a subsequent interview, when the Sheikh came to see me immediately after his return from Failiyeh, on the &amp;th April, he was full of a second meeting he had just had with the Wali at an entertainment given by Abdul Wahab-al- Kirtas at Seraiji. The Sheikh gave the conversation as follows:—the Wali had condoled with him regarding the reverse suffered at Sheikh Sadun s hands and had then gone on to flatter and compliment him, after which the Wali had explained that the Ministry of the Interior at Constantinople had asked him the following questions :— (1) Had Mubarak bought the Fadhagiya property really himself from Ahmed Pasha Zohair and had he paid the purchase-money ? (2) What was its area and the price paid for it? (3) Whether there were any claims by the State on any of the land ? The Wali said that he had replied to these queries both to the Ministry and to the Grand Vizier as follows :— (1) That Mubarak had paid the price at the time of purchase and had had possession ever since. (2) That the area was 480 “jaribs” and the price paid ^'T 48,000. (3) That the property was unencumbered and that the State had no lien That Mubarak already held property in the Basrah Vilayet of an estimated value of some four million pounds Turkish.

Shakespear, LA , Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bup v,, ’ r ^ I have the honour to refer to the correspondence em^iflg with Second on it.Having told him so much the Wall had then said that theTapu Office would register the transfers in the Sheikh’s name and that of his sons as he desired. The Sheikh told me that the Wali did not explain that he acted on any orders from Constantinople, and, though he expected the usual condition to follow, (that of Mubarak’s registration as a Turkish subject), no such demand was made by the Wali on this occasion. He therefore metely thanked the Wali and wondered what had brought about the change in his formerly hostile attitude. 4. If the above account is true, and, from the fact that the Sheikh announced in his “ Majlis” on his return that the Wali had said his properties should be duly registered, I am inclined to think it is, it would seem either that the Ottoman Government has waived its objection of its own motion or that the Wali has really convinced it of Mobarak’s bona fides in the purchase; whichever may be the case, the situation seems to have improved considerably. 5. On my enquiring from the Sheikh whether he had asked Abdul Wahab-aU Kirtas to approach the Tapu Office again before the Wali’s benevolent attitude should change, he informed me that he had already told him to carry through the transfers, that he would on no account register himself as a Turkish subject though if the difficulty could be got over by registering the names of Nasir (his blind son) and some of his women-folk as Turkish subjects, he would have no objection. I pointed out that in view of the Wali’s new attitude this would be unnecessary, and I was almost sure would be regarded by Government as most undesirable. I added I was giving my own view in order that, if he agreed with it himself, he might instruct Abdul Wahab-al-Kirtas not to delay, but that, if he preferred, I could write and obtain your opinion. As the Sheikh expressed himself willing to hear my opinion I went on to point out that the course was undesirable for the following reasons :—(a) none of the Sheikh’s other property was registered as belonging to a Turkish subject (i.e., in the name of a person holding a Turkish nationality certificate) with the exception of his Mutawiya gardens as explained in paragraph 10 of my letter No. C.-7, dated the i8ih January 1910, (b) that, by taking out a certificate of Turkish nationality for any of his own family, he would create a precedent which had hitherto never existed, (c) that having done so would furnish the Turkish author 4 ties with-a strong argument—that as the pro perty is registered in the name of the Sheikh’s son and family, and they are Turkish subjects, obviously the^Sheikh recognizes himself and his property as entirely subjects to the Turkish Government, {d) that, after his death, the division of his property would present enormous difficulties and probably raise most undesirable questions if portions were found registered in the name of a son holding a Turkish nationality certificate, (&lt;?) that such a course might make it exceedingly difficult in the future for the British Government to render him that measure of assistance which they would like and which he might possibly find himself in a position to require. I said that to my mind by far the best course now was for him to ask Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas to make in writing to the Tapu Office formal application (which is his duty under the terms of the sale-deeds) for registration of the transfer as soon as possible. If the registration is effected, well and good, while, if refused, the Sheikh would be in a much better position to know how the case stands either at Constantinople or with the Wali or both, and in any case could be no worse off than at present. 6. The Sheikh appeared to agree with my view but whether he will act as I suggested I do not yet know. I shall take an opportunity of asking him in a few days and will then again report. I was at pains to explain that I was giving my own opinion only and to the best of my ability in the Sheikh’s own interests, and trust that the suggestion in the circumstances will meet with your approval. &amp; \X No. C.-18, dated Koweit, the 13th April 1910.

When visiting me after his return from a trip up-river at which he had met the Wali of Basrah, the Sheikh informed me that he thought the case of this embankment had at last reached a conclusion. He said that the Wali and the Officer Commanding the troops at Basrah had both been to Fao, had told him that he was at liberty to repair the embankment whenever it should become necessary and had also given the Commandant of the Fao Fort strict injunctions that he should not again interfere with similar works on Sheikh Mubarak’s properties when they required repairs. 3. There is a rumour also to the effect that the Turkish authorities do not consider the fort of any military value and that the Wali has an idea that it would be of more use if demolished and converted into a school! . 4- Sheikh Mubarak said that during the year the soldiers had been annoying his men at Fao in petty ways, which he had not reported to us as they were of a trifling nature, but he now hoped that he would have no further trouble from the fort. &gt; No. 979, dated Bushire, the 24th April 1910.

When I said 'Turkish nationality' I meant the sentence to apply only to Hubar&gt;aj&amp; and Koweitis for of course otxier nationalities such as r'inglish, French, etc are accepted, but in the case of howeitis, the Turkish officials will not accept 'Koweit' but insist on 'Turkish' nationality. 3. With reference to your letteV No. 1650, /f/O dated 19th June /to the Government of India and espe- oially to paragraph 3 at thereof I would venture to siibmit the following observations resulting from a thorough discussion of the whole subject with His lia- -jesty's Consul at Basra. In your letter you foresee the possible alternative of advising Sheikh Uobarak to resell the property and of having to indemnify him for any loss thereon. With all deference I would venture to deprecate any such course and for tne Ifollowing roaaons:- (a) .Tiie Sheikli is certainly alarmed about* “this pro perty but at the same time I am inclined to think novr he is not improbably exaggerating that alaim for our special benefit as a means of forcing our hand^ to free him from Turkish attentions• (b) .Mr Consul Crow considers that the possibility of the sale being repudiated is an extremely remote one seeing tnat the sale deeds bear the signatures of most of the notables of Basra as well as the cachet of the British Consulate. (c) .The property is so large that a buyer would be difficult to find who would purchase it as a single lot, and there is besides the grave objection in the advice of a resale of an appearance of weakness on our part in sustain ing the Shaikh's claim. 4. In my humble opinion it would be far more ad vantageous to maintain tne position of our special interests in Koweit, the Sbftlkfe 1 M long - continued in dependent status, whilst pressing upon the Porte tnat the recognition of Koweit as a nationality should suffice for the M Tapu f * office. The Porte is I aimit not likely to agree but as there seems no immedi ite risic of the Sheikh losing his property, it would seam worth while to state the above as defining to some ex tent what is the actual status quo in Koweit. 5 # The question of the status of Koweit must come up before many years and it seems fairly obvious that the Turkish officials have realized the powerful lever they possess for raising that issue in the re gistration question, which goes directly to tne root of the matter on the point of nationality. The re gistration of any of Mobarax’ s family, whether the /t women or sons, would seem undesirable as likely to ad mit the principle ax xgprimst that Koweit nationalityis unrecognisable as against Turkish. For the same reason the taking out of Turkish 'tesKerehs** by Kowait subjects is uo be deprecated and though uhe Sheikh denies iu I hear from other sources that many Kowaitis with business or land in Basra have already done this* Under uhe new order of things this practice is likely to grow and in a few jears hence it seems to me tnere will be far greater difficulty in insisting on the independence of no wait than is the case at present# and it is for that reason that I would urge that the question should not be avoided* I have the honour to be.

Captain shakespear's present conmninication seems to me to confuse two hypothestfs^or aspects of the question, which need to be distinguished, and to introduce a third which is new to me# (i). The first of these is that the Wali of Busreh is tech nically and legally correct in his attitude towards the transfer question (as Captain Ghakeopear suggests in paragraph 6 of his letter Wo.35 of 8 th June) and is merely interpreting against the public, including Sheikh Mubarek, the provisions of/a law of general application in the Busreh Vilayet, - a dead letter under the old *v \ yk regimeregime but strictly enforced under the new, - wbdoh permits of no transfer of landed property in the said Vilayet except on the condition that the acquirer declares himself to be of Turkish nationality* (ii). The second hypothesis is that the ^ali , s attitude is not based on any such law of general applica tion in the Vilayet, but is merely an arbitrary departure from ordinary usage devised in the hope that by throwing Sheikh Mubarak into a state of apprehension lest his bargain should otherwise be upset and himself possibly put to great loss* they will drive him to declare himself or Ills sons to be of Turkish nationality* (ill)* The third and to mo new aspect of the question is indicated in paragraph 2 of Gaptain Ghakespear f s present report, namely, that the iiusreh authorities do not primarily and positively contend that Sheikh ihibarek must necessarily declare Turkish nationality he might declare French, .nglish or any other nation ality if he enjoyed it, but that '.uowaiti* is no nationality and that for dheikh kubarek Turkish nationality alone is indicated* 3* If the position with which we now have to deal wore that indicated in |iii), then it would seem that it might bve possible for us to induce the Porte in a friendly way to accopt Uie def- * inition 'howeiti' as a nationality for purposes of registxration 4 in the case of land-transfers, in order to avoid the raising of . awkward issues* A recent report, however, from Moharamerah seei-s 1 to indicate that hypothesis (iii) must be eliminated. Lieutenant » Wilson writes that the Gheikh £f kohammerah informs him that the * lands in Turkish limits which he purchased last year, known as Umm-el-Tuwailah (an Island above Failiyoh) have not yet been registered, the present Vali haying refused to permit it and that the Gheikh has decided to wait on events and lot the re gistration remain in abeyance until he sees what action we are going' ■ going to take to soe SiioikJa Mubarak through hie present dirfioulty• It .vould appear, thererore, that it is either contingency (i) or (ii) with which we have to reckon* In the former case, it we make enquiries from the Porte they will probably reply that their ./ali’o action is not directed against oheikh Mu- bar ok but is merely the interpretation of existing land-laws applicable to the Busreh Vilayet; that Ihoikh LIubarek is under , no obligation to buy property in the Buaroh Vilayet, but that ... ii he does, he must fulfil the same preliminaries and condi tions as other persons; and that unless he complies the trans fer cannot be recognised by the Turkish Courts and so the property must bo considered as still belonging to the persona in whose name it has hitherto stood* We should then be con fronted with the issue indicated in the concluding paragraph of my letter of 19th June* 4. If on the other hand the position indicated in (ii) is the one with which v/e have to deal, the issue is simpler and we seem to have good reasons for objecting on the ground that the . invidious treatment of dheikh Mubarak and the departure from k past usage involved constitutes an infringement of the status . quo in regard to ^oweit affairs fhich the Porto has undertaken . to observe. The Mohammorah report above mentioned, however, seems to point to hypothesis (i) the correct one* 5. It goes without saying that I entirely endorse the Politi cal Agent’s view tliat if the main question of the status of howeit is involved we have everything to lose by delaying to face the issue, and that the longer we do so, the more diffi— Quit will it become to got it settled in the way we desire*CONFIDENTIAL.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. C.-40 of the 30th June 1910, regarding Shaikh Mubarak’s Fadaghia property, and to forward herewith a letter with enclosures to your address from the Shaikh. \ 2. Yesterday evening, the Shaikh requested that I would come and see him as he had received some important news. On arrival, he had read to me a letter from his Basrah Agent as well as some other secret news to the same effect, one F tter being from a man whom l know to be one of the most influential men in Basrah and whose name he begged me to keep absolutely secret. 3. As will be apparent from the Shaikh’s letter and enclosures, there is reason to believe that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair (who has just returned from Constantinople) is likely to question the sale of the Fadaghia property either on account of inaccurate measurement or inadequate price. Whatever pretext may be used, it seems fairly certain that some method of re-opening the question of the original sale is to be employed, and Shaikh Mubarak will then find himself in the position, already foreseen, of being unable to appear in a Turkish Court of law to uphold his just rights, while the courts or the “ Tapu ” office have the legal power to declare Ahmad Pasha as owner and to give him possession. 4. The Shaikh himself thinks that the course, which Ahmad Pasha is re ported to be contemplating, must undoubtedly have the support of the Vali, if it was not actually suggested by him, in order to force Mubarak into accepting Turkish nationality. Abdul Wahab el Kertas was Ahmad Pasha’s attorney in the sale to Mubarak and the latter then forgave him a debt of ^T.2,500 in return for his good offices as broker, but Abdul Wahab still owes the Shaikh a consider able sum. The Shaikh considers he is no longer to be trusted and that he is quite capable of posing as the friend in need of either party, being governed in his choice solely by the amount he is likely to receive for his services. Ahmad Pasha, if he lias the covert support of the Vali, is hardly likely to resist the temptation of bleeding Mubarak, or, if he objects to that process, of prosecuting a claim for the property, worth it must be remembered some ^5 0 &gt; 000 * preposterous nature of his reported proposal to consider the sale void and to return to Mubarak the purchase price in to years gives an idea of what is con templated when it is noted that Mubarak has already long since paid over the full price, been in possession a year and a half, and spent considerable sums in improvements, drainage, buildings, planting, etc., on the property. 5. From other secret letters the Shaikh showed me, it appears that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair, Yusuf al Mandil and Say id Taltb (son of the Nakib) have realized that by misrepresenting matters to the Vali so as to damage Mubarak they have a very good opportunity of keeping themselves in funds at Mubarak’s expense. These are three of the most influential men in Basrah, two being Parliamentary representatives^ and as the Shaikh truly said, the Vali,2 who is already inclined to credit Mubarak with intriguing with the English, is almost certain to accept the dicta of such prominent men, however impro bable the story may be. The enclosures to the Shaikh’s letter contain evidence that these three men may be acting in concert, both in the matter of delaying or preventing registration of his property, and also in poisoning the acting Vali’s (Saad Bey’s) mind over the Zobeir incident referred to my in my letter No. C-43, of the 12th July 1910. The Shaikh is justified in his fear, and I think His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah wdll confirm my opinion that, should these three prominent men support any improbable story with their collective influence, there is no doubt that the Turkish officials would accept their view, almost without question. 6. The Shaikh was particularly frank with me, because I think he is now more thoroughly alarmed than he has hitherto been. He has held out against all the Vali’s persuasion to register his children as Turkish subjects ; the Vali, therefore, though outwardly friendly, is undoubtedly chagrined at his failure: consequently, an atmosphere particularly favourable to the usual methods of Turkish intrigue now exists. 7. I did my best to reassure the Shaikh, enjoining him to be especially careful in his dealings with the Vali so as on no account to rouse active hosti lity. He assured me he would not register either himself or his children as Turkish subjects without the consent of the British Government but he looked to us to assist him in this present difficulty. 8. He asked my advice as to what course he should pursue in the event of Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair actually sending men to resume possession of the Fadaghia property whether accompanied by Turkish officials or without them. I replied 1 could hardly advice him without reference to the Resident, but I was sure it would be as well to warn his fellahin and agent on the estate (Shaikh Saleh bin Brahim living at Dora) that on no account should there be any show of force or active hostility. Should an attempt be made to resume possession, his agent might endeavour to gain time by treating the intruders hospitably, explaining that he had no orders from his master and that without them he could not leave his charge, whilst requesting them to address the Shaikh direct in the matter. The Shaikh had a letter drafted to this effect at once, and I trust that in the circumstances my action will meet with approval. In view of the Shaikh’s extreme anxiety, I would solicit the favour of ins- structions, for the Shaikh certainly anticipates some such move very shortly. P. S .—Since the above was drafted, the Shaikh has sent me a copy of the last communication from the Vali on the subject of this property, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy with the Shaikh’s own letter. It will be seen that the Vali’s offer of assistance differs materially from that described in Mr. Consul Crow’s letter No. 20, dated the 6th June 1910, to your address. The Shaikh has sent no reply to this letter. Dated 6th Rajah 1328, 13th July 1910. From— Shaikh Mubarak-es-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, To— COLONEE Cox, British Resident and Consul-General, Bushire. After Compliments .—I represented to you descriptively on the 26th Jemadi I 1328 about the dangers which threatened to overtake my property el Fada ghia and forwarded to you a copy of the letter from the Agent of the seller, Abdul Wahab Pasha el Kertas in which he warned me of the evils of delay, and 1 (stated that I) saw dangers surrounding my property but that my confidence was in your sense of honour and protection. I did not care for all their vain intrigues especially when I received a reply from you dated the 28th Jemadi I 1328 corresponding with the 7th June 1910 in which you stated that the facts of the case have been represented by telegraph to the Government by you and that you hoped that they will be able to devise a proper scheme for the solution of this difficulty in a satisfactory manner. I was much pleased and remained waiting during this period, and the present Vali of Basrah used to evince to meall sorts 0 f courtesy for political ends. Firstly, he asked me to beg for the extension 0 f telegraph wire and I excused myself with suitable excuses and explained t 0 disagreement of my subjects (to such a course) and diverted his mind. j-jj s on |y hope depended on the second matter, viz, the obtaining of orders fo r the settlement of my property, the el Fadaghia, so that he may con vince m e to register it in the names ot my elder sons, Jaber, Salem, Naser and Hamad anc i take out Turkish papers of nationality; but I asked that it (the property) should be (registered) in the names of my son Naser and his seven sisters who are minors and that he (Naser) should be appointed as their ie S a l guardian because he is nearly pious and possesses the noble knowledge (iheology), and it was my intention to leave him with his sisters in an isolated property. My elder sons possess the property at Fao which is a large one, and which will be sufficient for them. I tried much to convince him but he could not be convinced. Now there has occurred the intrigue which I feared would take piece in the affair, viz., that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair has arrived from Constantinople and learned about my disagreement with the objects of the Vali and the Vali’s annoyance against me for my failure to comply with his objects ; and he has begun to meddle with the affair and to bring about causes, basing his action on the Government Tapu which he has in his possession The local Government also renders him assistance on the strength of the official Government Tapu. My papers being of the ordinary from, are not to be considered as reliable. All these actions are taken by the Vali with the o &gt;ject of frightening me to yield to his demands. 1 however do not care for their vain action by the good graces of the High Government, and I depend on righteousness and hold reliable docu ments from them and have shown them copies thereof, and they contain the testimonials of all the leading men of Basrah and the British Consul, Mr. Crow. Under these circumstances I believe that 1 myself, my sons, my town, my subjects, the inhabitants of Kuwait and my properties are under the protection of the British Government; but, as I saw their interference and the intrigues used by them according to reliable information which I have received from my Agent at Basrah and from certain merchants of Basrah who are on friendly terms with me, I send you herewith, the copies of those informations. Inshallah, they will be perused by you and you will endeavour to solve this question a dav sooner (i.e., at an early date). I will not absolutely proceed beyond your opinion, idea and consent, and shall not agree with the Vali in his object as regards the taking of Turkish papers of nationality. In the same way that I am obedient to your orders and consent in refusing to take Turkish papers of nationality, you may safeguard my rights and my property on which I have spent a large sum of money, for making watercoures and burrowing, and also protect me from the dodges. I have described all the facts to you, hoping to receive the assistance of the British Government at the earliest time. Please defend me against vain intrigues and afford me your kind regards. May you ever be preserved. (Translation of Enclosure No. i.) Copy of a letter received from a Basrah merchant who is a friend of mine. .Sir, The circumstances and proceedings of the people of Basrah are not hidden from you. Not a single man exists amongst them who may possess nobleness, i his story is too long and I pray God to improve their condition, because all their proceedings are directed by worldly covetousness. A few days ago Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair came to our side and met with Sayid Tahb and V usuf el Mandi and they convinced him to refuse absolutely the settlement of (the affair) of the el Fadaghia, to nullify the purchase and to refund the money he had received by instalments within fifteen years. In my opinion this is an intrigue of Yusuf and Talib in these days You may write to Talib to use his endeavours and speak with Ahmad and also to use his influence with the Vali to effect a4 settlement of the el Fadaghia and I do not deem it advisable that the settlement should be delayed any further, because delay has evils. The doings of the house of Zuhair are well known to. all the world and to yourself. Talib and Yusuf have been trying for some time past to bring about annoyance between you and the Vali, and it appears that they have found a course to do this in connection with the matter which occurred in the vicinity of Zobeir, vis., the plunder which took place 2 days prior to the Vali’s arrival at our side. Talib, Ahmad and Yusuf convinced Saadat Bey that all these plunders have been committed by order of Shaikh Mubarak and he even wrote you a letter from Mohawwalah on this question. The Vali summoned Saadat Bey yesterday and he made the Vali to understand that this plunder had been done by your order, and the Vali has sent you a strong telegram because he has a changeable mind and he has not firmness of mind. The clique are determined to create annoyance between you and the Vali and you should know how to reply to him. He believes that the Zobeir question is a fabrication and the cause which has greatly contributed to his annoyance is that you wrote previously that you wished the el Fadaghia to be settled in the names of your elder sons and he wrote to the Porte and obtained a reply, but you stated afterwards that you wished the settlement to be made in the name of Naser and your daughters. This is what has disturbed him. (Enclosure No. 2.) 4th Jemadi 1 1328, 12th June igio. 7 o His Excellency Mubarah-es m Subah Pasha, Kaimmakam {Deputy of Kuwait. Governor) Sir, I have duly received your esteemed letter dated 27th Jemadi I 1328 and I understood what you have stated. I cannot say that it is hidden from you as to what troubles I took to untie the knot formed by His Excellency Mahram Effendi. My hand nails are still feeling the pain, and as a result 1 obtained an irade from the Sublime Porte that the el Fadaghia should be placed in the name of your four sons and you had also requestsd for this. Now, in this your letter you have abandoned what you had asked for and requested that the bargain should be made in the names of your son, Naser Bey and his sisters only. This I cannot represent to the Sublime Porte because it is different from your request, and it becomes necessary for them to draw their attention to what had been written by Mahram Effendi, and if you desire that a reference should be made to the Sublime Porte you may in that case bring forward an argument against that point. It is to be regretted that I cannot say anything against my previous statement, according to which I obtained an order from the Sublime Porte. You have large properties in these parts and it is possible for you to give orders that those properties should be registered in the names of your son, Naser Bey, and let the Fadaghia bargain to be made as arranged and thus put an end to this question. This is what has crossed my mind, and you will naturally know what is advisable for you. Salaams. (Sd.) SULEIMAN NAZIF, Vali of the Province of Basrah. (Enclosure No. 3.) It is stated that the Vali is annoyed against Shaikh Mubarak because he (the Shaikh) wrote to him (Vali) that he wished to register el Fadaghia in the names of his elder sons and the Vali accordingly wrote to Constantinople and received a reply, and that Shaikh Mubarak has then written to the Vali that he wishes to register it in the names of Naser and certain ladies. Another cause which has contributed to his annoyance is that he has • been told that the Bedouins who had plundered the people of Zobeir are the Arabs of the Shaikh5 and that the latter had sent them to do so in consequence of certain proceedings taken by the people ot Zobeir against Shaikh Mubarak. For these reasons the Vali is greatly annoyed. May God improve the situation. It is said that the Vali’s annoyance has been brought about by Ahmad Pasha After Compliments. —I hope that you will always be in good health. Jj keg to inform you that I have learned from persons whom I consider reliable that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair has been convinced by certain parties to abandon the execution of the settlement on the presumption that the value (paid) is less than what is the worth of the land and that the “ Tash ” (river frontage) has not been included in the measurement and such nonsense. He has made up his mind to send surveyors to take measurements, and, if the surveyors are prevented from doing this, they will then turn out the farmers through the Government because he holds Government papers, and the Govern ment makes the land over to the party holding Government papers without making a reference to the Courts. A certain friend of his has given him advices —and I think it must have been Abdul Wahab-el-Kertas—(stating that) the matter will result in litigation and it is advisable that he should wait, and he will of course receive a letter from Shaikh Mubarak to effect a settlement and that he should write that he has been deceived in the valuation, and the land is more than the measurement and the “ Tash ” has not been included in the measure ment, and that either he should make a second measurement with an addition of so much money on every jarib, or, if he did not agree to this course, the land should be restored to him (Ahmad) and the value to be refunded by instalments in the course of io years. This is what his friend has told him. Ahmad Pasha has kept quiet accordingly. The object of these devilish temptations is that Abdul Wahab-el-Kertas should intervence in the matter and be benefited through his intervention by (the forsaking of) the claim which you have against him, in the same way that he was benefited from the 2,500 Turkish pounds which was due to you by him, and which he took in lieu of brokerage when you purchased the lands. And Ahmad Pasha will probably not agree even if you pay him a larger amount than the value of the property, and the truth or falseness of this news^will become evident to you whenever you wish to record his statement in the Government Office for the purpose of taking out documents. This is what was necessary to be stated to you. az-Zuhair who repudiates the sale and wishes to use certain means which he has in view. (Translation of enclosure No. 4.)

It will be convenient to separate what the Turkish officials are legal1* entitled to insist upon from what appears to be their present practice:- (1) Hy potheses (1) and (11) in „ our letter under reference are both partially correct for the acquirer of land must declare his nationality at the time of registering the transfer of the property. For example^ an Englislman acquiring land in Basra would declare his English nationality and the same would be duly entered in the 'Tapu' office registers when the transfer to his name was applied for. In any subsequent suit re- —gar ding his land the fact of registration in the 'Tapu' office books would give the9^ Englishman tho right and. opportunity to de fend or enforce nis rights appearance in the proper Turkish Court. He woula how- -ever sup or be sued in a manner exactly [9 . . ^ _ similar^any Turkish subject, his Consul not haying the right to assist him in an^ way r nor could he plead any rights under the Capitulations. Thus with the transfer re- corded he becomes for all matters concern- ina that land practically a Turkish subject, though enjoying his own nationality. I', he neglects to have the transfer to his own narae recoraed, he has no right to appear as- a party at all in any Turkish Court, T..e courts- will only recognize ana hear those foreitogers in whose names the land actually stands in the 'Tapu' office books, while Turks of course always have the tught to appear by virtue of their nationality. Tnir example will show what is the legal pjsrtijn of a foreigner acquiring land in Basra. (11). The authorities in Basra, however, go be„onci this legal position ana insist on Turkish nationality certificate^ being pro duced by ■ all and sundry , under threat of refusing registration of transfer. TnOy rely on the natural ignorance ana .ear of legal technicalities prevailing among me Arab a and Persians who wish to acquire land in the Basra Vilayet as well as their appre hension of losing property already paid for, without a possibility of legal remedy. This belief is sedulously fostered by the autho rities amongst the ignorant, but no such preposterous demand is made urom an i,ngli.-.'i, French or other subject who is certain toM b 0 make enquiries and ascertain t,he le^al posi tion. ho successful has the misrepresent- -ation been that several wealthy anci well- educated men connected with Basra* with whom I 'nave discussed the matter, refused to be lieve that I could personally acquire land in Basra and have the transfer registered in tne 'Tapu” office in my own name without first becoming a Turkish subject myself. 3. In addition to the above the authorities refuse to admit that Koweitis or indeed an^ Arabs at all have any separate nationality - they claim that all Arabs, ipso facto, are the Sultan's subjects ana therefore Turks in nationality . Consequently in pur suance of the new regime's efforts to consolidate the Turkish empire, the opportunity is- apparently ^eing utilized in the case of the landed classes ( at all events in these outlying provinces), to force an outward and visible sign of Turkish nationality upon Arabs who hitherto have regarded themselves as more or less independent, though owning religious alle giance to tne Sultan as the Khalif of Islam. 4. The matter is an intricate one which the gt-n.ej.al ignorance of even well educated Arabs combined with the Sheikh's tortuous methods makes none the easier to elucidate but I trust that I have given its bear ings sufficiently clearly above to show that recog nition b^ the Turkish authorities of 'Koweitf' as a distinct nationality would go far towards a permanent settlement of the present as well as the larger quest ion of the whole status ox Koweit.

From—Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. ^ ' With reference to my telegram No. 997, dated 27th October 1910, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy Koweit, No. C.-64, dated 25th October 1910. t ^ ie 1 marginally noted letter, since received from the Political Agent, Koweit, regarding the attachment by the Turks of the date crop on the Eadaghia property belonging to Sheikh Mubarak and the measures taken by the latter to secure the removal of the attachment, already briefly reported in my telegram above-mentioned. 2. The attitude of the Basrah authorities towards this question is another of the factors which combine to bring me to the opinion expressed in my V V 1Q in telegram that the present position is No. 1029, dated 2nd November 1910. «i m p 0SS ibi e », and Captain Shakespear’s views as expressed in this present communication have my entire concurrence. r'h r VlT / &gt; r' No. C - 61 , Confidential, dated Koweit. the 25 th October 1910 , From—Captain W. H. I. Shakespeae, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence regarding Sheikh Mubarak’s Eadaghia property ending with/your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 2793, dated the 19th October 1910. 2. As you met the Sheikh at Mohammerah in person no answer is required to the query addressed to me in Captain Crosthwaite’s endorsement No. 2659, dated the 4th October 1910, to which I have not been able to reply earlier 's/ owing to the Sheikh’s absence from Koweit. 3. Since his return, however, I have discussed the subject with the Sheikh, and it appears that subsequent to his meeting with you and after the despatch * of your telegram of the 14th October to the Secretary of State, attachment of the date crop at Eadaghia was actually carried out, a number of Turkish soldiers being posted in the gardens and all shipments stopped. The Sheikh tells me that he then again sent his Secretary to the new Vali pointing out the injustice of the procedure in view of the facts known to all that the property really belonged to Sheikh Mubarak, that he was ready to pay the revenue due, and indeed that though prepared to do so for a long time, the offer had been declined by the Turkish authorities. Einally, the Sheikh informs me the revenue was actually accepted and a receipt passed for the amount citing that the “ revenue for the Eadaghia property standing in the name of Ayesha Khanum had been received from the hand of Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr.” The Sheikh seemed pleased with this subterfuge and said that the attachment was then immediately removed by order of the Vali. 4. It was of very urgent importance that the attachment should be raised as early as possible and the Sheikh may have cause for self-congratulation in having effected it by his own unaided efforts; but it is impossible to avoid the reflection that as a solution of a very important question involving ultimately the whole status of Koweit, it is an exceedingly poor substitute for the recog nition of “ Koweiti ” as a distinct nationality, distinct that is to say from Turkish. The difficulty has been tided over for the present, but the Sheikh is still left exposed to the machinations of the Turkish officials at Basrah, and is still unrecognised officially as the rightful owner of the property. 5. In submitting this report, I have the honour to solicit your utmost support in recommending to His Majesty’s Government that no really perma nent solution of the difficulty is possible until at least the recognition of “ Koweiti ” as a distinct and separate nationality has been obtained from the Turkish Government. The Sheikh again expressed his faith and reliance on British support, but, considering his age and the extent to which his patience has already been tried in this far-reaching matter and one which at present also so closely affects his pocket, it is, in my humble opinion, one deserving of the most urgent consideration, if His Majesty’s Government still attaches importance to the maintenance of our special position in Koweit and to the possibilities of the port, both commercially and strategically in the near future.*io. 1)2!}!? of i9io British Residency and Consulate-General iiusiiire From Lieutenant-Colonel P.Z.

Letter Jo,7* To The* Superintendent of Registration, uuereh. The date grove which the ..aimraaitani of .uoweit, iiubareit es subah, Pasha, wishes to pui’chaee from the notables of iiusreh (vizj the nl-Zoheir necessitated an enquiry. ^An en quiry was made by the Ministry of Interior and a reply was received from the succeeding /ali; and the telegrams and memorandum received from the Ministry of War contained cer tain remarks which spoke for themselves. The telegram stated that the date grove which hubare*. es Jubah, Pasha, wishes to purchase xk and which he wishes to register in the name of his four sons, comprises seven thousand seven hundred and twenty four Donums and its value is forty eight thousand odd Turkish Liras; that the greater part of the value has been paid and the aforesaid Mubarak Pasha wishes to register his four sons in t2ie Roll of registered individuals and wishes, after taking out Turkish Passports, to settle the registra tion in their favour, before the formalities for the enlist ment of his two sons in the Army are observed. For this reason, it is not desirable to delay th© regis tration and in view of the reports received the postponement and dexuy ox the registration are inadvisable, and compliance with the request of Mubarak es Lubah will lead to enhance his sincerity and friendliness. This is what we understand, and the tone of the communications received is favourable to this (course) and it is desirable yhat compliance should be made in due time. If the said parties are registered in the uoll of registered individuals and took out Turkish Passports and il two of them underwent enlistment, you should execute therjgi^tration of the data grove in the names of hia sons. ^n authority haa been given by the iiniutry of interior according to their communication ai-d to the procetidings of the special committee of deputies (.vhioh was formed) in connection with this, and the Vaii and the Office of he- gietration have been advised as per i-emorandum to do the needful and to report the result.
