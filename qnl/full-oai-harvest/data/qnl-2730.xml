The correspondence is principally between the Residency Agent at Sharjah, the Political Officer of the Trucial Coast, also at Sharjah, the Political Resident at Bahrain [Persian Gulf Political Residency], the Political Agent at Bahrain, representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited and Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, the Foreign Office, the rulers of Sharjah and Dubai, as well as the leaders of a number of more minor tribes.The correspondence covers the arrangements for, and the progress of, survey work carried out by the company during the winters of 1947/48 and 1948/49, in the territories of Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Ras al Khaimah [Ra's al-Khaymah], and in particular within the vicinity of Buraimi [Al-Buraymī].Matters of a political nature were referred by the company to the Residency Agent or the Political Officer. The following issues are covered within the file:numerous incidents of resistance from local Bedouin inhabitants, usually triggered by transgression of tribal boundaries, particularly from the Beni Qitab, Manasir, and Naim [Āl Na‘īm] tribes;tribal and territorial allegiances that impacted on the work of the surveyors, and the efforts to secure access to survey areas for the company from the interested parties.Folios 69-73 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Beni Qitab (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Buraimi</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geological surveying</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Dubai</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000131#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000131#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000131#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
