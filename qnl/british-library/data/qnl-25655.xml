The Foreign Office ask, as a first Instalment, for our concurrence in the draft note on the Ottoman Bank question (the document immediately below Sir W. Lang^/’s letter). The draft note seems quite suitable, and follows generally on the lines advocated by this Office; see our letters of 30th November, 1916, and 22nd Feoruary, 1917 (flagged). It does not prejudice the case, which has been urged both by this office and by the Government of India, for the eventual establishment of a wholly British bank in the Hejaz, to the exclusion of French interests. The wider questions raised in the Foreign , Office letter will be taken up as soon as the present submission has been disposed of. The issues involved are obviously of the very highest importance^ as the French note has brought to a head the whole question of British and French interests in 'independent' Arabia. Simultaneously, the Italian Government has presented a formal claim to a position of complete equality with Great Britain and France. In view of the far-reaching effects of any decisions that may be arrived at, there might be advantage in referring the whole question to a strong inter-departmental Committee in the first instance.In any further communication on the subject, please quote . no.

He would therefore suggest that the v/hole question should he carefully examined hy the competent Departments of His Majesty T s Government and he would he glad in the first instance- t to he favoured with the views of Mr. Chamberlain as to the line on which a reply to the French Notes should he conceived in order that no misunderstanding may*he allowed to subsist as to the position and intentions of His Majesty’s Government in the Arabian peninsula. In view, however, of the fact that Monsieur )« y Cherchali has been instructed to associate His Majesty’s Government in a representation he will address to King Hussein regarding the closing of the branch of the Ottoman Bank at Jeddah^and that he is reported hy Sir H. ./ingate to have already arrived in Egypt, Lord Robert Cecil considers that an interim reply should he returned to Monsieur Gambon at once in regard to these representations, and that early consideration should then he given to the question whether His Majesty’s Government should now lay down the principle that the only Bank at Jeddah is to he a British Bank, and whether or not immediate steps should he taken to cause such a Bank to he established. ^ I am accordingly to enclose herein a draft Note to Monsieur Carnbon in v/hich the French Government are informed that His Majesty’s Government cannot associate themselves with the representations to he made to King HusseinHussein on this subject, and I am to request that you will in the first instance submit this Draft to Mr. Chamberlain for his concurrence.

French Government have cormunicated to ug substance of instructions given to Mustapha Cherchali. Main object of Mission is stated to be settlement of questions affecting Moslem French Pilgrims, but certain general political instructions have been added for the guidance of the Mission. Cherchali will act as official agent of French Government but will not have diplomatic status. As regards purely pilgrimage question he is instructed to complete purchase of pilgrims hostel, and to place tiie building in the charge of the Habou Administration since French Government cminot themselves own property in Mecca. He is at the same time to prepare for and supervise forthcoming French pilgrimage and to examine questions oi dues, fees, exchange etc. General instructions issued to Mission are, however, of much greater importance and raise whole question of Franco-British relations in Arabia. ..hey are as follows. M. Cherchali is instructed not to initiate political discussion but he is furnished with follow ing resume of the position in case Haschernite Govern- mentGovernment enquire his views, As regards Syria he is to remove the impression which has grown up in Arabia that France has disinterested herself or that she is on the other hand opposed to the de signs of the Sherif for expansion in these re gions, and he is to intimate the general tenour of ohe Asia Minor z\greernent without actually divulging its terms, if he is asked as to the eventual policy of France towards Syria he is to refer to his Government for instructions before replying. Text of instructions bearing on this point contains passage of which following is literal trannlation:- 'France, in agreement with England, desires only to maintain on the one hand the independence 01 the bherir, and on the other hand the integrity oi his possessions. We feel as do our Allies, that no European Power should exercise a dominant or even a preponderating influence in the Holy Places of Islam and we are resolved not to intervene in politi cal questions affecting the Arabian Peninsula. We feel moreover, in full accord with our .lilies, that no European Government should acquire a new foothold (Stablissement) in Arabia. While feeling that no Power should obtain either new territory or political prestige in Arabia, the French Government recognise that the proximity of Egypt and the Persian Gulf creates a situation in favour of the commercial interests of our English Allies which you should bear in mind. I feel there fore that it would be desirable that whenever question of this nature are raised, you should reserve your opinionopinion pending the receipt of instructions for which you should aslc, either from the .juul d'Orauy or from our Minister at Cairo, and which will be concerted with the British Government' Instructions then proceed to deal with .‘Syria in general sense noted above, and mention inci dentally that it is the intention of the Pencil Government to encourage the nomination of lir.irs at Aleppo, Damascus losul etc, and themselves to appoin tecnnical Advisers to these Emirs, and to provide capital j.or exploitation of the country. Instruction continue. 'On the sea coast, where the population is more mixed, it will be essential to establish a special regime which will be accorded under the direct aegis o± the ityench Government. Ao regards Jerusalem and Palestine a modus vivendi will he discussed having as its object the respect of allreligions and the Giierif will bn ad mitted to this discussion'. f Instructions then proceed to examine question of establishment of a Pranco-British Bank at Jeddah, and the Gherif is to he informed of the 'painful impression' which his refusal to permit the reopening of a Branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank has made on the 'Pencil and British Governments', and lie is to he urged to revoke this decision which must he due to 'a misunderstanding'. Pull text of these Notes will follow by hag, hut it is clear that Prench now desire to limit their recognition of our special position in Arabia to an admission of our preponderant commercial interests. I consider that a very explicit reply should he returneddh» returned to taese ]&gt;Iotes and I should be (;lad to receive your observations as to the line which such a reply should follow. I am consulting the India Office in the same sense, Meanwhile I am informing French Ambassador that we will send a full reply in due course to the general issues raised in his Notes, but that as regards the Ottoman Bank we are still of opinion that the opening of a Bank in the Hedjas would for the present be undesirable and that King Hussim’s attitude has been perfectly justifiable that we cannot therefore allow ourselves to be associated with Gherchali l s representations in the matter, and that in any case we would be unwilling to support the claim of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, in what ever form that Bank were constituted, to trade in the Hedjas. You should inform Colonel Wilson how matters stand and thus enable him to prevent Cherchali erecting misconceptions in King Hussim’s mind about the Ottoman Bank.SECRET. B. 247. BRITISH INTERESTS IN ARABIA. It is understood that a memorandum is desired, explaining why the exclusion of Italy from Western and Southern Arabia and the Red Sea littoral is important in British interests. 1. 1 he importance of Arabia from its geographical position, lying along two of the main approaches to India, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, is a commonplace. iNio part of the country can he completely indifferent to (Ireat Britain, who is the only Power that at present has a foothold in the country. Our hold is limited to a narrow fringe along the coast, from Aden to Koweit; its security depends ultimately upon the tranquillity of the interior. Since w r e are unable to intervene in, or control, the interior, it is essential to exclude all possible seeds of disturbance. 2. Arabia is not a State in any effective sense, but a fortuitous concourse of tribes—more or less settled in the fertile regions near the coast, elsewhere wandering—under Chiefs, the limits of whose sway are determined, not by frontiers, but by the tribes w T hich they for the time being control. Their politics are closely interwoven, and a quarrel may run right across the continent. With the tribes and Chiefs along the coast mentioned v'e have treaty relations. 3. In addition to this we occupy at Aden an area of 75 square miles with a considerable hinterland, the frontier of which, with the Yemen, has been demarcated. The Chiefs within this frontier are -under our protec torate. 4. The strategical importance of Aden need not be emphasised. 1 he ortress of Aden is almost impregnable against tribal forces. In circum- Tances as they existed before the war we could hold it with a very small 'orce, and control the protectorate by means of prestige and subsidies. 5 The Vden-Yemen frontier is a frontier quoad the Turks, not quoad ;he Arabs, who do not greatly respect it. Its demarcation was necessitated aro-elv by the intrigues of our semi-independent neighbour the Imam of Sanaa whom the Turks encouraged when it served their purpose, but could lever effectively control whei he chose to defy them. But we had recognised Turkish authority, and whenever some petty local indent owirred t ie only remedy was representations at Constantinople. Ihe Imam has pretty ^tensive claims on our side of the frontier—indeed, they extend to he Hadramaut tribes on the coast the other side of the protectorate To the i i anat whprc the frontier has not been demarcated, vt arc aorth and ^ast^e^^ltom ^ ^ ^ and by our treaty 3i l7Y w tl hie SuHan of Shehr and Mokalla, which, however, suffice ord? so long as the tribes of the Hadramaut hinterland are not tampered A Q Aden is the gateway of a considerable 0. In addition to hci 0 }‘’f ove t \ ie wa r about 300,000h per annum), land trade with the \emen (\ Adell t0 Taiz— desirable for political sa. - **■ - - trade it already possesses. _ • , p i rh» i - v T+olIon omhitions are mainly nxecl. ine 7. It is the A emeu on ^ . ^ g c elf and w p en the Turk is ejected from Yemen is as little a unity as, _ j t qq ie Jdrisi, we know, will claim Arabia it will fall to no one Arab master.down to and including tlie Imam of Sanaa will claim the greater part of the remainder, and there are certain Sheikhs (like Mavia) on our border whom'it will be to our interest to maintain independent. We have by treaty guaranteed the independence of the Idrisi in his own domain (undefined), and undertaken to arbitrate between him and the Imam where their claims clash. The Idrisi and the Imam are possibly irreconcilable adversaries, though the removal of the Turk may bring them closer together. 8. The Italo-Turkish war made Italy the most unpopular of the Christian Powers in the Moslem world. 'Phis unpopularity is enhanced by Italian methods of colonial administration, and by national characteristics— in particular by Italian treatment of the women of subject races, a point on which Moslem opinion is very sensitive. Moreover, the Iman has an especial ground for detestation in that Italy blockaded his coast, and supported the Idrisi with arms and money during the war. 9. From the preceding description of the general political conditions it must be clear that the- appearance of Italy in the Yemen would create in Western and Southern Arabia a ferment which would not be limited to that region, and from which we, as the limitrophe Power, would be the chief sufferers. Our consent to it would be resented by the Grand Shereef and by the Arabs as a breach of faith towards the so-called Arab State, and it is probable that this resentment would be shared by the whole Moslem world (including India) who would consider that, after having betrayed the Turk, we were now betraying the Arab. This would react unfavourably on our position at Aden, and our reputation as a Power friendly to Islam. The Arabs have made use of our support against the Turks, but they do not like us any the more ; and when the Turkish danger is removed it is by no means certain that the brunt of their dislike will not in any case fall on us, and with redoubled force if it is thought that we have released them from the Turk (who is at least a Moslem) only to hand them over to the most hated of Christian nations. If the Idrisi, in virtue of his former connection, welcomes the Italians, it is certain that the Imam will oppose them. That will mean hostilities on our border, ending at the best in a precarious peace, seeing that the Italians will be far too exhausted to undertake decisive operations in the hills. With our experience of Italian relations with the Senussi in Cyrenaica, and of the resultant friction with Egypt, we may know what to look for in Aden, and we may expect before very long to be ourselves involved in hostilities on, if not within, our own border. If, on the other hand, the Imam accepts Italian domination, it must be expected that part of the price he will ask will Be the support (at least tacit) • of his claims where they will not conflict with Italy’s, i.e., in our protectorate and in the Hadramaut; and against his intrigues we shall have no redress but appeals to Rome, which are likely to be even less fruitful than were appeals to Constantinople. If these anticipations are well founded, it is clear that our position in Aden will have to be put on an entirely different footing'. Instead of keeping a handful of troops in the fortress and exercising a weak control over the tribes by subsidies, we shall have to hold the Protectorate in force—and this is surely not a piospect which His Majesty s Government can regard with equanimity. 10. The present war has shown the use that may be made against us of Islam. Arabia is of great importance in the Islamic world, not only as the cradle of Islam and the seat of the Holy Places, but also because its geographical position interposes it as a wedge between the Islam of Africa and that of India and the surrounding countries. 11. I he ultimate success of the policy of Ills Majesty’s Government in the Middle East depends to a large extent on the transfer of the Caliphate from 1 uikey to Aiabia. -This in turn depends upon the possibility ofmaking the ruler of the Hejaz sufficiently strong to he able to pose as an independent sovereign. 1 his again depends upon keeping the Christian I o\\ ers at a sufficient distance. But an Italian occupation of the Yemen would from the relations in which the two regions stand to one another— make Italy the mistress of the Hejaz. “ If Al Yemen goes, Islam is gone,” an Arab Saiyid said to Colonel Jacob as long ago as 1912. 1 hose are some oi the reasons for which we took the precaution of providing in the Anglo-French Convention that “ the British and French Governments agree that they will not themselves acquire and will not “ consent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian peninsula. For the present purpose a sphere of influence is equivalent to territorial possession. 20th January 1917. A. H.[8^247] Sir Edward Grey to M. Gambon. (Secret.) Your Excellency, Foreign Office, May 15, 1910. I SHALL have the honour to reply fully in a further note to your Excellency’s note of the 9th instant, relative to the creation of an Arab State, but I should meanwhile be grateful if your Excellency could assure me that in those regions which, under the conditions recorded in that communication, become entirely French, or in which French interests are recognised as predominant, any existing British concessions, rights of navigation or development, and the rights and privileges of any British religious, scholastic, or medical institutions will be maintained. His Majesty’s Government are, of course, ready to give a reciprocal assurance in regard to the British area. I have, &amp;c. E. GREY.[87247] (becret.) Your Excellency, Sir Edward Grey to M. Cambon Foreign Office, May 16, 1916. 1 HAY E the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s note of the 9th instant, stating that the French Government accept the limits of a future Arab State, or C onfederation of States, and of those parts of Syria where French interests predominate, together with certain conditions attached thereto, such as they result interests, but, since His Majesty’s Government recognise the advantage to the general cause of the Allies entailed in producing a more favourable internal political situation in Turkey, they are ready !o accept the arrangement now arrived at, provided that the obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus, and Aleppo. It is accordingly understood between the French and British Governments— 1. That France and Great Britain are prepared to recognise and uphold an independent Arab State or a Confederation of Arab States in the areas (a) and (b) marked on the annexed map, under the suzerainty of an Arab chief. That in area (a) France, and in area (b) Great Britain, shall have priority of right of enterprise and local loans. That in area (a) France, and in area (b) Great Britain, shall alone supply advisers or foreign functionaries at the request of the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States. 2 . That in the blue area France, and in the red area Great Britain, shall be allowed to establish such direct or indirect administration or control as they desire and as they may think fit to arrange with the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States. 3. That in the brown area there shall be established an international administration, the form of which is to be decided upon after consultation with Russia, and subsequently in consultation with the other Allies, and the representatives of the Shereef of Mecca. 4. That Great Britain be accorded (1) the ports of Haifa and Acre, (2) guarantee of a given supply of water from the Tigris and Euphrates in area (a) for area ( 6 ). His Majesty’s Government, on their part, undertake that they will at no time enter into negotiations for the cession of Cyprus to any third Power without the previous consent of the French Government. /&gt;. That Alexandretta shall be a free port as regards the trade of the British TT,mr&gt;irP and that there shall be no discrimination in port charges or facilities as from recent discussions in London and Petrograd on the subject. I have the honour to inform your Excellency in reply that the acceptance of the whole project, as it now stands, will involve the abdication of considerable British co-operation of the Arabs is secured, and that the Arabs fulfil the conditions andbrown area only make the project unfeasible, that the French Government shall be prepared to consider that the line in question may also traverse the polygon Banias- Keis Marib-Salkhad Tell Otsda-Mesmie before reaching area (b). 8 . For a period of twenty years the existing Turkish customs tariff shall remain in force throughout the whole of the blue ano red areas, as well as in aieas (u) and (b), and no increase m the rates of duty or conversion from cicl vclIoictyi to specific iat^ shall be made except by agreement between the two Powers. There shall be no interior customs barriers between any of the above-mentioned areas. The customs duties leviable on goods destined for the interior shall be collected at the port of entry and handed over to the administration of the aiea of destination. 9. It shall be* agreed that the French Government will at no time enter into any negotiations for the cession of their rights and will not cede such rights in the blue area to any third Power, except the Arab State or (Confederation of Arab States, without the previous agreement of His Majesty’s Government, who, on their part, will give a similar undertaking to the French Government regarding the red area. 10. The British and French Governments shall agree that they will not themselves acquire and will not consent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian peninsula, nor consent to a third Power constructing a naval base on the islands of the east coast of the Red Sea. This, however, shall not prevent such adjustment of the Aden frontier as may be necessary in consequence of recent Turkish aggression. 11. The negotiations with the Arabs as to the boundaries of the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States shall be continued through the same channel as heretofore on behalf of the two Powers. 12. It is agreed that measures to control the importation of arms into the Arab territories will be considered by the two Governments. I have further the honour to state that, in order to make the agreement complete, His Majesty’s Government are proposing to the Russian Government to exchange notes analogous to those exchanged by the latter and your Excellency’s Government on 26th April last. Copies of these notes will be communicated to your Excellency as soon as exchanged. 1 would also venture to remind your Excellency that the conclusion of the present agreement raises, for practical consideration, the question of the claims of Italy to a share in any partition or rearrangement of Turkey in Asia, as formulated in article 9 of the agreement of 26th April, 1915, between Italy and the Allies. His Majesty’s Government further consider that the Japanese Government should be informed of the arrangements now concluded. I have, &amp;c. E.

In so far, then, as these arrangements directly affect the relations of Russia and Great Britain, I have the honour to invite the acquiescence of your Excellency’s Government in an agreement on the following terms :— 1 . That Russia shall annex the regions of Erzeroum, Trebizond, Van, and Bitlis, up to a point subsequently to be determined on the littoral of the Black Sea to the west of Trebizond. 2. That the region of Kurdistan to the south of Van and of Bitlis between Mush, Sert. the course of the Tigris, Jezireh-ben-Omar, the crest-line of the mountains which dominate Amadia, and the region of Merga Var, shall he ceded to Russia ; and that starting from the region of Merga Var, the frontier of the Arab State shall follow the crest-line of the mountains which at present divide the Ottoman and Persian Dominions. These boundaries are indicated in a general manner and are subject to modifications of detail to be proposed later by the Delimitation Commission which shall meet on the spot. . _ , ^ 3. That the Russian Government undertake that, m all parts ot the Ottoman territories thus ceded to Russia, any concessions accorded to British subjects by the Ottoman Government shall be maintained. If the Russian Government express the desire that such concessions should later be modified in order to bring them into harmony with the laws of the Russian Empire, this modification shall only take place in agreement with the British Government. # . 4 . That in all parts of the Ottoman territories thus ceded to Russia, existing British rights of navigation and development, and the rights and privileges of any British religious, scholastic, or medical institutions shall be maintained. His Majesty s Government, on their part, undertake that similar Russian rights and privileges shall be maintained in those regions which, under the conditions of this agreement, become entirely British, or in which British interests are recognised as predominant. 5. The two Governments admit in principie that every State which annexes any part of the Ottoman Empire is called upon to participate in the service oi the Ottoman Debt. j &amp;c&gt; E.

MEMORANDUM ON IT l E SUPPLEMENTARY CONCLUDED WITH THE IDRISI SAIYID ON 1917. ENGAGEMENT 22xd JANUARY In this engagement with the Idrisi it may appear at first sight that we have given more than the occasion demanded. The truth is that the Idrisi refused jioint blank to admit the really essential paragraph III. without his counter-proposals being added. It is necessary to understand his attitude. T he Idrisi does not know how the war will end. Last year he was certain the Allies would win. He is less hopeful now. Then, he feared we might patch up a peace which left the lurks in situ as his implacable foes: to-daij, he looks round and sees(249 lieni \erj much to the fore in Arabia and holding their own. He cites Halioj, [vunhda and the lailure there; the slow progress of the Sherif of Mecca, and iinally Mesopotamia, and he doubts our ability to dislodge them His fears to-day are two-fold. He believes that— 0) his refusal to treat with any other Power, and his promise uot to dispose of harasau Islands and rights therein, will draw upon him 1 urkish animosity. 'I he Turks up to now have watched his coquetry with us but believe they can win him back to the fold hereafter. Let them once come to know of his closer “nexus ' with us as regards the Islands and they will regard him as completely ostracised. Ihere is no arguing with a fanatic of such preconceived notions ; (-) this engagement will deprive him of future assistance in arms and ammunition from Djibouti and Massowa, both of which places ha\e lot main yenis very considerably assisted in the arms traffic. Cut off from these two sources of supply to whom, he asks, should he apply for the necessary sinews of war, and whom should he approach hereafter except the British Government ? The Government must therefore take the place of these two Powers. The sole Power the Jdrisi fears now, and after the war, is Turkey aided by Germany, and the reason given for securing not only our promise of assistance in arms, but of advice in the development of his country, an asylum —should a crisis in the country compel his temporary withdrawal— coupled with the assurance of a continuation of these terms after the war to himself and successors —is this one inordinate fear of a prospectively irate Turkey. From this obsession he could not be dissuaded. At first it was our flag that would incense the Turks, and on the second visit it would be the engagement to refrain from a cession of the Islands that was bound to arouse Turkish resentment. At one time in the proceedings the Idrisi had insisted on the despatch of British troops inland, if he were attacked by the Turks, but I reminded him that cur earlier treaty was confined to his sea-board and to protection by sea power. 1 may say that although this engagement in its inception was peculiar to the Farasan lslands, yet the Idrisi was loud in predicting for the whole of his territories the ill-forebodings he had conjured up as the likely result of his agreeing to paragraph HI. It was therefore not possible—given the desideratum of securing his adhesion to this paragraph—to exclude from the agreement this extended area of his entire sea-board. His Minister (Bu Sabi) declared (and we cannot refute it) that the Farasan Islands were the Idrisi’s before the 30th April 1915, 1 Dateo hist tieau an( ] that, though not specifically men tioned, the Farasan became at once a part and parcel of his sea-board and within the purview of that treaty. One result of the present agreement, will be the exclusion ot Italian inlluence in the Idrisi’s domains. His Minister told me that the Italians were very desirous of concluding some agreement with the Idrisi to secure a (iuid pro quo of their long established connection qua the arms trade, and tint even now the Italians sent him ammunition. At the same time the Idrisi scouted the idea of dealing with any Power save Great Britain, and to our Government he looked for every form of assistance. \s regards j aragraph V. I found it impolitic to insist on an\ fixed uber of his retainers on the Island. I had insisted on a number not less than one hundred men,” Imt this was met by the argument that many more might lie required and the exact number had best be left to time and om-mrsnuice. The Minister who was deputed on board said that the Kansan ‘islanders were a very stout body of men who would give a account of .hen, selves if necessary. I waived the point of ,.umbers for I was Teaiing With a peculiar east of man, and was guided also by the principle that especially with Asiatics, is enforce nor supervise without causing friction, engaged to ensure his il effective occupation. mini4 Atom-first meeting the Idnsi could not ullde ” ta ^ 1 ^oi 0 ^ 1 ' we feared.

I am not aware of any future cut-and-dried division of the several interests in the Red Sea, but it had occurred to me that to hoist our flag and to land our troops would saron of British occupation and place these islands facto within the categoiy of matters to lie adiusted aftei the war. in i We are already assisting the Idrisi with the sinews of war^aml the only foe after the war against whom he asks protection is the 1 m v i &lt; is left in the’Asir province.

Letter to Eis Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Treaty c ioncluded with the Idrisi Saiyid.My Lord Marquess, With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 17th Febru ary ]915, we have the honour to forward, for the consideration of His Majesty’s • No c. 343 , d*ted the nt May 1915 . Government, a copy of a letter* from °ur Political llesident at Aden, with which he submits a Treaty signed by himself and by the representatives of the Idrisi Saiyid, for the ratification of the Government of India. 2 . T his Treaty does not appear to have been very conciselv or verv clearly drafted, but the terms generally coincide with what You/Lordship approved in your telegram of the 28th December 1911. The Idrisi, on his side, undertakes to make a pact of friendship between himself and the British Government, to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen and to extend his territories at their expense, and at the same time to abstain from any hostile or provocative action against the Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. The British Government, on their side, undertake to protect his territories from attack on the seaboard, to guarantee his independence in his own domain, and at the conclusion of the war to use diplomatic means to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi and the Imam. Further, they have no desire to enlarge their territories on Arabian soil but wish merely to see that the various Arab rulers live peaceably and amicably together, each in his own sphere. As a mark of appreciation of the work to be performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government have aided him with funds and munitions and undertake to give him further assistance in the prosecution of his campaign against the Turks, in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities. Finally, the British Government agree as heretofore to give the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scone to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden. 3 . The only point that appears to require definite qualification is the expression “Arabian soil” in Article 6 , as this scarcely falls in with our position in Mesopotamia. If the words “ Western Arabia ” were substituted for “ Arabian soil,” this objection would be removed and our intentions would be sufficiently defined in the Treaty. 4 . It might also perhaps be urged that by allowing the Idrisi under Article 3 to extend his territories and at the same time under Article 5 guaranteeing his independence hereafter, we may beposition vis-a-vis other Arab Chiefs, hut our position in this matter is safe guarded by the condition that the extension of the Idrisi’s territories should be at the expense of the Turks, and should he hereafter involve himself in a collision with other Arab Chiefs by an aggressive policy, we could point to this condition and disavow his action. 5. Further, it might have been desirable to insert a clause giving British and British Indian traders free access to the Idrisi’s ports, but this might legitimately be held to be a corollary of the pact of friendship which it is the object of the Treaty to consolidate. 6 . As any further assistance in funds or munitions to the Idrisi is explicitly to be in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities, our responsibilities in this matter would appear to be sufficiently safeguarded. 7. We think, therefore, that, although the Treaty as drafted is open to objection on the ground that it is neither very clear nor very concise, it will, if the small amendment suggested in paragraph 3 above be effected, adequately meet the requirements of the situation. We would ask, therefore, for authority to ratify it as it stands subject to this qualification. To return it for extensive revision to our Political Resident would be to endanger the ultimate success of the negotiations, and would, at any rate, involve undesirable delay. If Your Lordship agrees, we should be glad of orders by telegraph. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) HARDINGE of PENSHURST. „ BEAUCHAMP DUFF. „ R. W. CARLYLE. „ S. A. IMAM. „ W. H. CLARK. „ R. H.

Shaw, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- In sending you by this mail three copies of the Treaty signed by me and ie Idi isi Saiyid tor the ratification of the Government of India, I have the honour to state that the Idrisi representatives will leave to-morrow for their country. Ihey appear to mean business. 2. 1 here is little left to be said. Paragraph 5 is the most important one, and is m accord with the cipher instructions received from you. 3. Paragraph 7. The precise details of assistance in funds and munition is expressly omitted at the request of Saiyid Mustafa and is done to avoid wounding Arab susceptibilities. A receipt in full for assistance given has however been obtained. The concluding portion of this paragraph is very essential. Having begun a good work with so important a Chief, and one so inimical to everything Turkish, it will be necessary to prosecute the matter a outrance, but I was careful to insert the last nine words of the paragraph as showing the quid pro quo for which the Idrisi is responsible. 4. I would request that two ratified copies of the Treaty may he returned to me, one to be given to the Idrisi and the other for this office records. This Treaty of Friendship and Goodwill is signed by Major-General D. G. L. Shaw, the Political Resident, Aden, on behalf of the British Government and by Saiyid Mustafa bin Saiyid Abdu’l ’Ali on the part of His Eminence Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris the Idrisi Saiyid and Amir of Sabia and its environments. 2 . Its main objects are to war against the Turks and to consolidate a pact of friendship between the British Government and the Idrisi Sajyid, abovementioned, and his Tribesmen. 3 . The Idrisi Saiyid agrees to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen and to the best of his power to harass the Turkish troops in the direction of the Yemen and to extend his territories at the expense of the Turks. 4 . The Saiyid’s prime objective will be against the Turks only, and he will abstain from any hostile or provocative action against Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. 5 . The British Government undertakes to safeguard the Idrisi Saiyid’s territories from all attack on the seaboard from any enemy who may molest him ; to guarantee his independence in his own domain and at the conclusion of the war to use every diplomatic means in its power to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya or any other rival. 6 . The British Government has no desire to enlarge its borders on Arabian soil but wishes solely to see the various Arab rulers living peacefully and amicably together each in his own sphere, and all iu friendship with the British Government. 7 . As a mark of its appreciation of the work to he performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government has aided him with both funds and munitions and will continue to assist him in the prosecution of the war so long as it lasts in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi s activities. 8 Finally, while maintaining a strict blockade on all Turkish ports in the Red Sea the British Government has for some months past been gn in the Hnsi SaVd full and free scope to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden, and this concession the British Government, in token of the inenclsh [ existing, will continue uninterruptedly to maintain.9. This Treaty will be held to he valid after its ratification by the Government of India.

M a Picot went out under the impression that he was to participate in Palestinian administra tion. There is much confusion on this as ANNEX A will show. Anyway M. Picot found himself in an im possible position and did his best to maintain his dignity without provoking a real rupture. The French feel that we have made good politically in Palestine by setting up an all-British administration. They now fear we may extend this all-British provisional administration in Syria if the fortune of war carried us there. ITALIAN POSITIO N, In considering the Italian attitude we have to take into account the following facts:- (a) no ideas about the modern outlook at all. They only think of annexations, stragetic frontiers, etc,; (b) They stick to the idea of equal shares, irrespec tive of effort, expenditure, participation, or pre vious events; (c) // ~ v “ “ vu ii -oney took it.

I suggest this were best don: y agreeing to appoint an Italian adviser on Italian n erests in Palestine and a French adviser on French -aterests in Palestine to the G.O.C. E.E.F. M. Plcot s prepared to support this idea, if it be accepted here is a complete end to inequality, and the ad visers' duties can be defined, ihe Italians win not think be difficult in matters of definition and liml. a ion so long as it is clear that there Is no dif ference in status between the two advisers. We must also conciliate the French This w* i^encn. This we can do by coming to an understanding as to the position of the French High Commissioner in Syria in the event of our occu- Pttng any part of Syria. I am aware that this is • difficult, and military objections will be raised, hut the matter is one of importance, and r regard U as essential to disabuse the French of any idea of our having ulterior motives in Syria, regard this suspicion on the part of the French as dangerous to ‘■'he Entente as a whole, and any arrangement we may make in regard to Palestine must be such as to lead to its removal. ( 2 ) /(2) In ardeT i&gt;o -XieveXop^dha- AJ^abnmv’am/irrt - V v U; i / &lt;V f l,l„|IH H' J » I submit that the following steps should be taken:- , (A) That we and the French should submit the (n) suggested Joint declaration to the King of Hejaz (ANNEX C), and get the main lines published and. known to all Arab-speaking peoples we can get into touch wlth 0 It may be that there is an objection to the no-annexation clause s but if we are to counter the Turk propaganda we must be clear onhhhis point* we may reserve the right to make ourselves temporarily responsible for order and defence in certain areas 9 and if it is thought fit, we could introduce words to that effect, but we must make it clear that we do not intend to seise and make part of our empires any portion of the Arabic-speaking world, (B) This done, we could then start : (I) A general propaganda among the various Syrian countries in Egypt and America, both North and South* (II) Promote conferences amongst the varS^s Arab chiefs of the Peninsula: (HI) Make our Mesopotamian policy plain to the public by the press accounts of the measures we are taking; (IV) Propagandise the Arabic-speaking peoples as a whole with the one idea of getting rid of the Turk; (V) Give the King of Hejaz all the moral support we could as premier Arab and initiator of the Arab movement, but carefully abstaining from forwarding his claim t© actual Kingship over Arabs who do not desire his rule;/CN V picot-s position in Palestine ( 11 In the course of my discussions with M. Picot, he re ferred as I expected he would, to the position he had held m Palestine,, Me told me he had had a very bad time indeed his government expected that he would have a share in the ad- mn^strauon, which indeed was promised in the War Cabinet decision of 1917 Jan: and though his Paris chiefs would not move in the matter:,! they blamed him for not managing to get what they would not press London to give him. However he was good humoured ..abfaut it, but pointed out that his position ought to be made clear before he returns. In this I agree and I submit, that it would be a proper and graceful act on our part if we were to inf^ the French that m all matters concerning political relations between the E.E.F. and inhabitants of the areas of special interest to France that we should use the French mission as out medium, and that the C.I.C Egypt Force would regard the French Commissioner as his political adviser on iulitary-Political questions which directly concerned 'these regions, • I am fiurther of opinion that we should assure the French Government that in event of our occupying any part of these areas of special interest to Franee that we should re^ on the French Mission to organise and control (with due regard to military decisibn) any temporary administration which it might be neces- sary to set up. ; 11118 Ministration it should be made plain would be subject to the -C.I.C. but the personel should be French. At present I think MV Picot has to combat the idea that we intend toto take advantage of the Military situation to set up anBritish civil administration in Syria if v/e get there and call it a military administration. From an Entente point of vie:;* this is an idea which should be dispelled,particularly as there is no immediate prospect of the case arising. We are not laying any fresh difficulties in the path of the' military, but anticipating, what, might if left to drift, prove a course of unnecessary friction. (Signed) MARK SYKES. July 6th 1916.(E) 1. In the opinion of the Governments of Great Britain and France there can be no prospect of a permanent and lasting peace in the kiddle East ao long as non-Ottoman nationalities, now sub ject to Ottoman rule, or, inhabiting areas hitherto subject to Ottoman rule now occupied by the Allied forces, have no adequate guarantee of social, material, and political security. 2. That the only guarantee of permanent improvement is to be found in the securing of self government to the inhabitants of such areas., 3. That in view of the condition of those areas arising from mis-government, devastation, and massacre, it is theopinion of the two Powers, that a period of tutelage must supervene before the in habitants of these areas are capable of complete self government, and in a position to maintain their indopenhance. 4. That the Powers exercising such tutelage should exercise it on the sanction of the free nations of the world, and with the consent of the inhabitants of the areas concerned.ANNEX- ' C„ DECLARATION TO THE KING OP HEJAZ ' © The Goverments of Great Britain and France desire jointly to inform the Government of Hejaz that their policy in x’egard to the Arabic speaking peoples of Araoia, Syria, Jazirah, and Irak is as follows:- sucn areas adhere free before the v/ar the Governments recognise and re-affirm the exist- . i:ns T^eedom and independence of the inhabitants. In such areas as have been liberated since the war by the efforts of the inhabitants, the two Governments recognise the complete and sovereign . independence of the inhabitants of those regions. Wikn- regard to such areas as are now occupied by the Allied forces it is the intention and desire of the two Governments that these areas should be permanently delivered from the oppression under which they formerly suffered, and that their future Government should be based upon the prin ciple of the consent of the governed c 4 0 With regard to areas still subject to Ottoman oppression it is the desire of the two Governments that the inhabitants of these areas should be de livered from the oppression to which they are now suojected, and that the inhabitants should bo pub in a position to decide upon forms of Government which appear most suitable for the various regionswith due regard to the maintenance of security and order. The two Governments desire to make it clear to the Government of Hejas and to the Arabic speak- mg peoples above mentioned s that on the part of neither Government has there ever been any inten tion of aimexing these areas nor of disposing of them, nor allowing them to be disposed of by any other party, in any way other than is desired by the populations thereof. The two Governments further wish to make it clear that they desire to facilitate to the utmost co-operation, alliance, and unity of purpose, among the various elements of the Arabic speaking peoples in the regions mentioned in the first paragraph, with a view to *che ultimate restoration of the liberty and prosperity which these areas formerly[•' t ' i ^ ^ ^j^u.

Monsieur Picot gave it as his opinion that the Agreement could not be abolished, as such an act would raise violent opposition and ill feeling among the Colonials in France, and would give great strength to ohe financial pro-Turkish elements both of -which would be most fatal developments, and helpful to the enemy. In this I agree and consider that to resuscitate anti British feeling and pave the way for Pro-Turkistan would be a double mistake. However I pressed tipcam Mens. Picot that there were three aspects Prom which the Agreement could be re garded as doing positive harm. I. That the Agreement was regarded by the Demo cratic forces of the Entente as an instru ment of Capitalistic exploitation and Imperialistic agression. II. That the Agreement had had a very unsettling effect on the Arab speaking peoples, giving ohejj/» l III t»hen on 'that v/c wero intoii't annexation. That the agreement could he construed in o s^nse Quite contrary to President Wilson’s policy, 10 znls ^^3ieur Picot agreed and alter some dis cussion ana car etui examination, v/e jointly drew o; the two enclosed papers. The paper A. is suggested as a method of dealing directly with the Arab difficulty, i submit it for careful consideration, it is susceptible of amendment but I uhinlc mat if in substance it is presented to the King oi Hejaz and the main lines of it indicated when and where occasion required, our position vis-a-vis the arabic speaking peoples will be improved, and we shall be rid of a constantly recurring difficulty. I do not believe we are sacrificing anything by making such a declaration, and it is in fact only dig: ■ ly different from one which His Majesty's Government made to the Arab memorialists. II we come out with such a declaration the way would be open to begin to pull the Arabic-speaking peoples together for common action and would dispell lor good and all the idea that we are endeavouring t- secure Syria, as a French Colony. further such a declaration puts an end to the possibility of any further capital being made by the enemy on the lines oi r JBmal. Pasha’s speech. At the same time it will be seen that we in no way commit our selves to any idea of a Pan-Arab Empire which is so detestable to {Syrians and others and makes the King of HO jaz’s cause less popular than it would otherwise be. The/q-p thp nt+ :,Ua To the oppressed people, ’ ^ such an exchange ox v 5 were made, we ahn,,^ -u &gt; ^nould ohen have a lorical hnoic. ■? future policy tm~ ^ 1 basis lo - ov - -V.

If the two Governments exchange views in the sense ojT pRepy r t ^ iper B. i bexieve that they will find them selves in accord with the views of the mass of the people, i further submit that if the existing Agreement '’is subipri' +&gt;10 ouoject to the principles enunciated in Pa9e1 ’ B ‘ 11 is no lon S er objectionable m a Democratic sense. It would be acceptable certainly to the popbk most intimately concerned viz: the oppressed peoples themselves, who,desire liberation and assistance, ucC* absorption and loss of nationality. ^ ^ If these two papers are agreed to in substance ; t unink that the original Agreement is robbed of most C f its objections: cur statesmen would have a very free hand in speech and action in regard to Turkish Armenian and Arab affairs.

That the only guarantee of permanent imorove- mcnt is to be found in the securing of self govern- jment to the inhabitants of such areas.

I. 1. Before dealing with lesser Psues 1 shouJd like to state the position -is 1 understand ,t to be at present, to make sure that I start from the r,&gt;ht premise'. fi - In the proclamation which we issued on our arrival at Baghdad we announced and''not “as C *'cr' r' ' e t0 tbe '' ol ; 111 at lar * e . ihat we came as friends and not as conquerors, to emancipate the inhabitants of the country from the oppressive rule of the Turks, and to assist then, to work out their destiny on more auspicious lines. Incidentally we invited them to come lorwaid and take part in the administration (ii) In the announcement of policy made by His Majesty’s Government in the teleginm of-.)th March I!Hi, from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceioy, it was stated that, whereas it was contemplated that the Basrah \ilayet (as then defined) should “remain permanently under British administration and annexation was definitely indicated, the Bao-hdad \ dayet on the other hand, was to he formed into an Arab State or Province under British protection, in everything hut name. _. Du l ing the year that has since elapsed the general situation lias undergone considerable development, an important feature of which has been the entry of Amei ica into the war, and in the latter connection certain fundamental principles have been enunciated for which America in particular and the other Allies in general aie tonsideied to be fighting. Of these principles the one which particularly com ei ns us at the moment requires that the peoples of the countries interested or alle&lt; ted should be allowed to determine their own form of Government. Recently the Prime Minister has publicly stated that the, destinies of Palestine, Mesopotamia, &amp;c., will be decided at the Peace Conference. d. I gather that it is now proposed to deliberate as to what particular steps or line ol action are advisable in order to square our working policy with the above principle and announcements, in case we should have to adhere to them in spite of the fact that Germany has not respected them in dealing with conquered territory in Russia. I. 1 assume that, if at the end of the war we find ourselves in a sufficiently strong- position, and in effective administrative control, we should still hope to annex the Basrah Vilayet and exercise a veiled protectorate over the Baghdad Vilayet; hut it is recognised that the question of annexation lias become exceedingly difficult vis-a-vis the P resident of the United’ States, who will presumably exercise the most potent influence at the Peace Conference. Our original proposals must consequently he regarded as a counsel of perfection, and we must he prepared to accept something less. At any rate, however, we have the strongest grounds, in view of our assurances to the inhabitants and the millions of money we have sunk in making the Port, for standing out for the annexatio n of Bas rah a nd from thence to the s ea, with a small block of territory necessaTy'lo round oil the enclaveT As regards the rest of the \occupied territories, the essential aim must he to effect the complete elimination of Turkish suzerainty, and it is assumed that we shall leave no stone unturned to achieve that end, only tolerating its retention in the last resort. 5. In any case we must set our faces against the admission of the slightest T urkisli element or participation in the administration. In this connection, I should mention that when 1 was in Cairo it was suggested that, as events were shaping, we S 12 40 4 IS Atvyr ^ hS 1 • 1 . cnmP pomtu-omise with Turkey at any moment; might be obliged or a ^ u,e . r , ° H P t !';i- s secre t overtures to the Turks ; anti when asked I also learnt there of ^eui ‘ • * ^ t we Avere compelled to come m y opinion I..h.t ,l,e p.i.uiioo ..[ .oooi,,,! c.cs'ofsSS.^S^ £ - least control or interterence j} v • pei . t i Iie nt one of Koweit.

There must be no Turkish Commissioner and no I urkish flag. ensure future special Hag must be devised A 0. Alluding for a moment to the question of relative status, as between the Basrah and Baghdad Vilayets respectively, it is my very definite opinion that a homogeneous administration in ali practical aspects is not m any way incompatible with a technical difference of political status, and that it is essential in the interests of the country that the administration of both Vilayets should lie uniform, that of the Basrah Vilayet heiii 0- brought into line with Baghdad in due course. 7. In considering the precise form of the administration there are several alterna tives to he weighed in the balance, and attached to each alternative are subsidiary difficulties which need consideration. For the moment we will consider the Baghdad Vilayet only, on the hypothesis that Basrah Vilayet can be made to conform to it at a convenient juncture. 8. The question of the “ Arab facade M offers no insurmountable difficulties to my mind. The essential problem is the determination of status to he assigned to the province of Iraq. It is agreed that the administration should he under British guidance, and the more complete the British control can he, the better for the country. In fact, unless it is assured the country has no future, for it would be impossible to get money for its development unless investors are satisfied that their interests are fully safeguarded, a condition which cannot he assured except under protective British supervision. How is that supervision to be achieved ? The most satisfactory solution would seem to he government by a High ('ommissioner assisted by a Council, formed partly of the Heads of the most important Departments of State, and partly of representative non-official members from among the inhabitants. Hut the foreign relations of such a government must obviously lie in British hands, and it would thus be practically a British protectorate. P. If such an arrangement could he achieved and recognised by the Powers, well ami good; hut if not, then the existence of a titular native ruler would become a necessity. I do not think it v T ould be impossible to find one, but the difficulty is that if the admimstiatioii w'ere given such a form it might be difficult for it to avoid being h.mipeied hv capitulations, and the right to consular representation bv Foreign Powers; the former contingency being one which we should obviouslv do our utmost to escape. H*. if it is. decided that w’e should have a nominal headpiece to the administration to conduct his own foreign affairs under British guidance, I think, as I have said above, that it would be possible to find a local candidate, and 1 cannot see the least3(o I 'I lire of I nn] wil.h r|,e Slierif, as one of t)n, nTiia'i'a i' * ll ' i ' M 1 ® ,llsca es'an of ibe ovor pennitled.

Until we can create this element, enlisting as far as we are able the assistance of the Egyptian and bond an Administrations, we must rely mainly on young British officers. I may mention here that whereas I have done my utmost to employ experimentally any inhabitants of the country at all likely to be suitable, this laudable endeavour finds no favour with the local inhabitants concerned.

We have taken over the structure of the Turkish administrative system as we fend it, substituting British officers for Mutessarifs, Qahnaqams, &amp;c., but for the present designating them Political Officers and Assistant Political Officers, while in the posts which, under the Turks, would have been filled by an. official of the status of Mudir, we have been able to employ natives of the counrry subject to the exception that wherever Pritish garrisons or troops are located it is essential, owing to the difficulty of the language question, and the fact that the local product cannot be left to deal with our troops, to use British officers, and we thus require more of them now than will be necessary in the permanent administration, after the troops have left. But apart from that, as I have explained above, until we can produce the necessary type of superior Arab official more extensive and close supervision by British officers will continue to he necessary. 16. In my opinion, with the unavoidable exception of the military regime of the Military Governors in the large towns, the administration as carried on now in Basrah and Baghdad Vilayets is that to which the people, both urban and rural, have been accustomed, except that the element of corruption is greatly reduced. 17. The branches of the administration in which we are necessarily most backward, and in regard to which our hands are in a great measure tied during the military occupation by military considerations and exigencies, are the Civil Judicial and Civil Medical. 18 As regards the former, Mr. Bonham Carter, the Judicial Officer who was lately appointed from Kgypt, has only been with me a short time, but is now getting into the saddle. 1 have submitted to the India Office a copy of proposals for a temporary — • » » X. v-' vv V.' j X. | / I v / | / \ / | 1 I J JL\.y x X V M.

The direction* in which ice can most usefully direct our energies with a tiew to ■populinsiug our Administration are Irrigation, Education, and Civil Medical In all these departments we are alive to the importance of speedy progress and are doing our utmost compatible with existing conditions and with the material at our disposal. \ re most nee d to encourage are: Firstly, -the Jewish com munity m Haglidad. In this connection I recommend that Dr. Weizman be induced if possible, to pay a visit or send a reliable representative to Baghdad to influence the Jewish community in favour of the British connection. Secondly, the Arab notables and nobility among the townspeople of Baghdad and Basrah. They are a somewhat impecunious and backward element, but one which it is very necessary to encourage and take into our counsels as far as possible. Thirdly, the wealthy landlord element, both Arab and Jew, and the important Shaikhs of the settled tribes. If it becomes a question of obtaining public expression of feeling in favour of British control, it can lie done; but 1 think the subject would have to lie handled cautiously. The intelligent inhabitants of Iraq at the back of their minds are possessed by the apprehension that Mesopotamia may conceivably he restored to the Turks at the Peace Conference, and as Jong as this nightmare is present with them we should merely emphasise it by asking them which Government they would prefer. Bv so doing we should be clearly putting them in a very unfair position because they know veil that if they elect for British control and if nevertheless the Turks were ultimately to return, all those who had declared for us would receive short shrift. It will be understood that the rural population of Iraq as a whole is quite inarticulate and can hardly be consulted. As regards the elements who do count, c.g., the Jews and other denominational communities in the large towns, they could without doubt be squared in some form to give expression to the sentiments that we desire. But Ave must consider and decide what is to be regarded as constituting the representative public opinion which we have to consult. -T Steps to he taken to consolidate Commercial Influence in Mesopotamia. The great initial difficulty here is the absence of commercial transport and general scarcity of tonnage and accommodation, and last, but not least, the uncertainty of the-2-C_ future It is difficult to encourage private enterprise when accommodation for agencies is not available. Sites and land cannot be sold, and machinery cannot he ^W'e are most anxious to encourage trade generally, but to announce that trade to Baghdad is open is to suggest that commercial tonnage both by sea and by river is available and not liable to be requisitioned. Another difficulty is that, owing to the importance of preventing supplies reaching the enemy from the markets of Iraq, we have not only to maintain an external blockade cordon, out have also to limit exports inland from Basrah to the minimum requirements of the towns and communities inside occupied territory. This in itself interferes greatly with the natural flow of trade, yet we can only relax our safeguards with great caution. As a mattei of fact, there has quite recently been some easing ol the blockade. London, 22nd April 1918. Z. Cox, Major-(General, Civil Commissioner, Baghdad.B. 281 . FUTURE OF MESOPOTAMIA. ^NoU‘ l&gt;\ I oliticnl IH'paitmcnt, Judin OHice, on jjoints for discussion with Sir [\ Cox. I. 1. Policy of His Majesty's Government—Certain conclusions regarding the future administration of Mesopotamia were formulated by His Majesty’s Government in March 1917 after the occupation of Baghdad. The main conclusions were : (1) that the circumstances of the Basra Vilayet were such as to require the permanent retention ol British administration ; but (2) that the Baghdad Vilayet should be organised, with British assistance and support, as an Arab State under indigenous administration. 2. Pledges to King of Hejaz.—Certain pledges affecting Mesopotamia were given by Sir ll. Mac Mahon to the Sherif of Mecca in 1915, during the negotiations preceding the Arab revolt of the following year. In a letter dated the 24th October 1915, Sir II. MacMahon pledged the British Govern ment “to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs ” within a specified area, which included both the Basra and Baghdad Vilayets, and he added an undertaking that “ when the situation permits, Great Britain will “ give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may “ appear to be the most suitable forms of government in these various “ territories.’’ This declaration was accompanied (i) by the general proviso that “it is “ understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance “ of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as “ may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration “will be Britishand tn) by the following special caveat in regard to Mesopotamia :— “ With regard to the Vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain will necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and to safeguard our mutual economic interests.’’ The Sherif replied (5th November 1915) that the provinces of Irak were “parts of the pure Arab Kingdom,” that they were “greatly valued by Arabs far and near,” and that “ we cannot satisfy the Arab nations or make them submit to gi'e up such a title to nobility. At the same time he agreed “to leave under the British Administration for a short time those “ districts now occupied by the British troops, without the rights of either “ partv being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab nation, which “ interests are to it economic and vital), and against a suitable sum paid as “ compensation to the Arab Kingdom for the penod ol occupation. J.he Sherifs proposal was never formally accepted, fen II. MacMahon merely replying that the matter required “ a much fuller and more detailed consideration ” than the circumstances of the time allowed. lie ignoitd the question of compensation. The Sherif, however, in closing the correspon dence (1st January 1910) was careful to keep this question alive ; and he reverted to it later in the year (25th August 1910) in acknowledging the grant to him of a monthly subsidy of 125,000/. by His Majesty’s Government. In this latter communication he spoke of his Government being ^ undei Great Britain’s guardianship and protection during her occupation of Basra cind Ivak ^ Quite recently (4th February 1918) Sir B. Wingate has been authorised to give renewed assurances to King Hussain in the following teim* . “IBs Majesty’s Government along with their Allies stand for the cause of the liberation of the oppressed nations, and are determined to stainl, v the -\rah peoples in their strnggle tor the recons.nn-tion of an Arah world in whieh law shall once agarn replace Otton.an violence, and unitv the artilicial rivalries promoted by l urkmh ( *eials. hs Maiestifl Government reaffirm iheir /ormer pMje, to in regard to the freeing of the Aral,peoples.

It may be adde d h tc that in November 1H14 we gave a public undertaking that Basra u ill nmer a train be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. In regard to Baghdad our declarations have been less definite, but General Maudes proclaniatioii of the 19th March 1917, in the course of which he invited the Baghdad Arabs to join their kinsmen “ in realising the aspirations of your race, ’ pointed clearly in the same direction. II. d. It is not suggested that the policy of II is Majesty’s Government, as laid down in March 1917, should be modified in essence. It is scarcely thinkable that we should suffer the results already achieved to be entirely thrown away ; or that we should allow a country of such historic associations and future economic possibilities to revert to the blighting conditions under which it lias stagnated for centuries past, and from which it has at length been rescued at so heavy a cost in British blood and treasure. In particular, local conditions being what they are, it seems essential that Basra should remain to all intents and purposes a British port (whether formally annexed to the British Crown or not), and that the surrounding district should be under effective British control. But, though our aims may remain sub stantially the same, it may not he possible, in view of the great change that has taken place in the general political situation during the past year, to realise them in full or in the manner originally contemplated. An early reconsideration and readjustment of the policy to be pursued in the occupied territory during the continuance of the war seems therefore necessary. 5. The main new factors in the situation may be classified broadly under two heads, viz. :—(i) the general trend of the war in Kurope; and (ii) the general change of outlook in regard to questions of imperial policy which the war has brought about, and, in particular, the spread of the doctrine of “self-determination” under the powerful advocacy of the President of the United States. b. i\s regards (1), the issue of the conflict still remains in doubt. But the possibility must at least be contemplated that complete victory, followed by a peace dictated to the conquered enemy, may prove to be unattainable ; and that the Allies may have to content themselves with a peace by negotiation based on some principle such as that of “ no annexations, which is gaining so many adherents in all belligerent countries, and particularly among those classes which, in the last resort, have the power to make their will effective. Of the Allies, Great Britain alone is in occupation of enemy territory. If the Central Powers should oiler to treat on the basis of mutual relinquishment of conquests, a claim on om pait to retain control over Lower Mesopotamia, even if urged on humanitarian grounds, might meet with but little support; and our case at tae 1 eace Conference will be rendered none the stronger bv the fact that three of our adversaries (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria) will be ! &gt;in the position, which we alone ^Inll ✓w., ^ . i enemy territory to bargain with It must 1 a-. ain0n ? , t , ie 4 llle l 3 ' ° r ^ ; -»vin^ peace by negotiation, Mesopotamia will have to takeTt- l' 1 **’ the , event o£ a settlement.

With regard to factor No. (i) it may be quite true that Mesopotamia by reason of tts loca coud.ttons, diversity of population, Ac., is ill °a ed fo the exercise ol “ sell-determ,nation.' But it does not follow that an attempt rw' not have to be made to put the principle into operation. The lime Mimstei, speaking on British war aims on the 5th January 1918 included Mesopotamta among the parts of the present Ottoman 'Empire entith.il to a recognition of their separate national conditions”; and I resident \\ il.mn has also spoken of the rights of these districts to security ami autonomy Autonomy and “ separate national conditions ” do not seem compatible ruth annexation (as was contemplated bv His Maiestv’s lovernment in the case of Basra) in any form; while it'is not easv'to reconcile thejn even with British suzerainty or a British Protectorate, unless the people concerned, or the local chiefs or leaders on their behalf, can he induced to accept our assistance and supervision of their own accord! 8 The conclusions that seem to follow are (i) that if our claim to control the destinies of Mesopotamia after the war is to be established, it will haver to be based on oilier grounds than mere right of conquest, and (iij that the nature of British supervision^will have to be less direct and overt than was contemplated in March 1 ( JI7. Ibis being the position, our policy during the period of military occupation should, Avhile avoiding the creation of a British administrative system of a permanent character, aim at placing British interests and influence in the country (already very favourably established) on so secure a basis as to guarantee their maintenance under any administrative system that may ultimately be introduced. I he question arises: Is the policy now being pursued a right one, both in its positive and negative aspects? and, if not, what modification’s are desirable? It should be made quite clear that, in raising this point, it is not intended to i effect in the smallest degree on the invaluable services rendered by Sir Percy Cox and his able staff of political officers in the occupied territory. On the^ contrary, the excellence of the work already accomplished, and the magnitude of the results achieved, are appreciated to the full. The attitude displayed by the people of Basra on the occasion of the Civil Commissioner’s recent visit bears striking testimony to the popularity of the British connection among one section at least of the inhabitants of the occupied districts. It affords proof, if proof were needed, that the. material results of British control are bearing fruit in the increasing prosperity, contentment, and goodwill of the native population. But it is felt that local political action would be placed under a handicap, and might be prevented from attaining its maximum of utility, if the Civil Commissioner were not furnished at this critical juncture with full and authoritative infor mation as to the general trend of affairs in Europe, with their inevitable reaction upon the Mesopotamian situation, or if he were allowed to retain the impression (as he might well do, unless otherwise advised) that the premises on which the policy of March 1917 were based can he assumed4 with equal confidence at Cox has been summoned Government. the present time.

River Navigation.—Commercial and industrial development affords an important and (provided everything in the nature of exploitation of the country in outside interests is rigorously avoided; perfectly legitimate means of consolidating British influence in Mesopotamia. One question calling for special consideration is that of River Navigation. The Trade Commissioners (Messrs. Holland and Wilson) who visited Mesopotamia in the early part of 11)17, expressed the view (paragraph 58 of their Report) that “in the first instance “ and for a considerable time to come, the main business of transport, both of passengers and goods, on the Tigris should be carried on by one Company, to be exclusively British in constitution ” ; and they recommended that this Company should be ‘‘constituted on the lines proposed in 1913, 1 with the “ omission of the lurkish and German elements, Lord Inchcape being Concessionnaire, and Messrs. Lynch receiving an appropriate share. A similar proposal was made by Lord Inchcape himself, in a letter to Lord llarclmge, dated the JOtli October 1917, in which be expressed the willing ness of his firm to start business, when the time arrived, “ as arranged before the \\ai, and sought permission to establish a house at Baghdad forthwith, bn 1.

Montagu sent up to no, with the following remarks:- (1) Mtisly_Lpf ^ft I fully agree with Sir R. Graham's alternative No. (4) and his remarks thereon. I would suggest omitting the article altogether, as we are debarred from claiming special privileges in the matter of concessions, the less we tie ourselves to the French the better. At present we have all the •good-will'. Under Article 2 we should be required to share this with the French, without, as far as I can see, getting any adequate return. Moreover no agreement beivee ourselves and the French would affect tie subjects of 3rd Powers, who would have the advantage over us of having their hands free. (2) Article- 5 . If we pledge ourselves to the policy of the 'open door* for French trade and navigation, we shall presumably have to extendextend the ease facilities to other -iilisd Powers. Probably :this will be necessary in any case; but we may find it/inconvenient to b« d«pri?ed in adTanco of any weapon with which to corobet Japanese cowpeti ^ior; in the Persian Gulf, I presume that Basra, which is in Zvns (B) is not to be considered as part of the 'Arabian peninsula for the purposes of Article 5. (3) Article 5 . It would certainly be wore satisfactory if we could obtain a formal undertaking from the French to suppress the arms traffic at Jibuti. But I venture to think that any agreement with France - however academic in character - aiming at the control of the traffic in the kiddle East would have a value for us at the present juncture. When the question is taken up after the war the boni fide co-operation of the French will be essential to us, and it will be all the easier to eecure this co-operation if the French Government are committed in principle beforehand, (see paragraph 6 of Report of lirms Traffic Sub Committee of the C.I.D., dated loth March, 1917. (4) The area of the Hejas, as marked on the map attachedattached to the draft agreement, calls for no criticim on our part. It does not, I think, anywhere infringe on territory claimed, either by Bin Baud or the Idrisi.I agree that the French note forms a suitaole basis for an agreement and concur in the suggestion that Sir Mark Sykes should be deputed to Paris* With reference to Lord Curzon’s points nos (1) and (3)^ I observe that the British Note of the 29th August disclaimed all intention Ho interfere with the complete internal independence of King HuseinH I think that it should be made clear, in drafting the proposed agreement, that our d£sint£ressement is confined to the Hej az (which will have to be defined), and that onr claim to special political influence extends to the whole of the Arabian peninsula outside that area* As regards Maskat, we gained our main point in February 1914 when the French Government agreed^© waive their treaty rights (under their treaty with Maskat of 1844) in so far as they might conflict with measures taken by the Sultan of Maskat to control the arms traffic. There would be some advantage in obtaining The cancellation of the 'Declaration' of 1862, in which Great Britain and France jointly guaranteed the Sultan ? s 'independence', and which thus gives the French (on paper) a claim to equality of interest with ourselves. But this is not a matter of urgency, and unless a very favourable opportunity occurs I would perhaps hesitate to complicate the negotiations by its introduction* g s.

COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE. Report of Sub-Committee on Anns Traffic. 1. We have been directed “ to consider the general question of the Traffic in Arms after the W ar with special reference to Native Races.” 2. W e start with the assumption that, whatever the military results of the war, its conclusion will leave all the belligerent countries in the possession of vast quantities of arms, ammunition, and war material of every description, for the greater part of which the Governments concerned will presumably have no further use. ihe world’s total stocks of destructive weapons will in fact be infinitely greater than at any previous period in history ; and the difficulty of preventing these weapons from reaching undesirable hands will be proportionately increased. Every belligerent Government will be faced with the temptation to recoup itself in some small degree for its heavy war expenditure by selling its surplus arms to private dealers; and, in some cases at all events, there will be no counteracting motive of self-interest to serve as a deterrent. Germany, for example, if she emerges from the war shorn of her Colonies, will have no interest in preventing the influx of arms into Africa. On the contrary, she will have every incentive to promote a traffic likely to cause embarrassment to one or other of her present enemies. It is not to be supposed that she will neglect so obvious a weapon, or that she will be deterred by any considerations of humanity, or of her general obligations as a civilised Power, from striking at her enemies, and particularly at Great Britain, by any means at her disposal. Of all the Powers, Great Britain, with her extensive Asiatic and African dependencies, offers by far the most vulnerable front to this line of attack. 3. We regard the whole position as one of considerable gravity. There are two distinct categories of persons from, whom danger is to be appre hended, viz. :—(1) the savage or semi-civilised tribesman in outlying parts of the British Empire, whose main demand is for rifles and ammunition; and (2) the anarchist or “ intellectual ” malcontent of the great cities, whose weapons are the bomb and the automatic pistol. • There is some force in the view put to us by Sir Mark Sykes that the latter will in future prove the more dangerous of the two. At any rate his activities will call for unceasing vigilance, and very special precautions will be necessary to control the trade in automatic pistols, which, apart from their extreme deadliness, are, by reason of their size and shape, more easily smuggled than any other type of weapon. As regards the tribesman, he already possesses rifles in abundance, and, desirable as it is to prevent him from adding to their number, it is, in our opinion, of still greater importance to check his supplies of ammunition, without which his weapons are useless to him. 4. Our conclusion is that the regulation of the arms traffic after the wal ls a matter of vital importance to the future of the British Empire, and one on which Ills Majesty’s Government would be well advised to frame a definite and considered policy with the least possible delay. \\ e submit below (paragraphs 5—8) a series of recommendations indicating the hues on which such a policy should, in our opinion, proceed. These recommendations deal with the question not only from the general point of view, but also with its local asoects as affecting particular zones and localities where the traffic are in a position to speak with expert knowledge on one oi olLei Inane li ot the subject. The attitude of France, which was the main obstacle before the war to concerted action by the Bowers on effective. lines, has occupied our special attention. Our detailed views and conclusions have been recorded in the separate Minutes of our proceedings which are attached as Appendices 1 to 4 to this Report, and which should be read in conjunctionJHI m,m jh u—: -■ iarjaa: ivith the Report itself. Our inain recommendations are summarised in the following paragraphs. RECOMMENDATIONS. o. General Agreement between Belligereni Powers. We eonsitler that^the 'whole^question of the future control of the arms traffic should be raised by His Majesty’s Government at the Peace Conference as a high moral issue of the utmost consequence to civilisation in general. It is to be assumed that one object common to all the belligerents, viz., the prevention of future wars, will figure prominently in the discussions of the Conference. Among the methods of attaining this object, the necessity ol restricting the indiscriminate distribution of modern arms and ammunition may well be placed in the forefront. The Peace Conference will afford an opportunity, which cannot be expected to recur, of securing the adoption of a policy of permanent international co-operation in the matter, which, if faith!ally adhered to, should go far towards ensuring the world against future incidents calculated to imperil the general peace. We recommend that the following undertakings should, it possible, be obtained from all the Powers represented at the Conference, including the British Self-governing Dominions : — (i) not to sell or otherwise alienate, in any circumstances whatever, the surplus stocks of arms and ammunition remaining in their possession at the end of the war ; (ii) to regulate the manufacture and sale of (a) automatic pistols and (b) ammunition of every kind under a system of strict State control; and to prohibit the export of these articles to any destination, except under Government licence ; (iii) to negotiate without delay an international Convention on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 of this Report, and to give effect to its provisions in their several Colonies, Protectorates or Dependencies within the proposed zone of prohibition. As regards (ii), it will probably be necessary also to secure the adhesion of other Powers than those represented at the Conference. G. Separate Understanding with France. —We further recommend that a separate understanding should lie arrived at with the French Government, preferably before the Beace Conference assembles, with a view to securing the honn ftde co-operation of France in any restrictive measures introduced by international agreement. Her attitude in the past has been the reverse of helpful. It was only after prolonged negotiation, and by the payment of over 60,000Z. in cash, that we obtained her consent to the regulation of the traffic at Maskat, for many years the principal arms depot of the Middle East. At Jibuti, her own East African (Somaliland) port, the trade (though tem porarily suspended during the war) has continued to flourish, not only unchecked, but under the active patronage of the local French administration, to whom it represents an important source of income. France has a strong interest in maintaining the traffic at Jibuti ; and so long as she retains the port, it is perhaps idle to expect any measures of restriction that will be permanently effective, unless it can be brought home to her that self-interest demands a more enlightened policy on her part. The local circumstances, it must be remembered, are such that the Jibuti traffic, while it is a standing menace to the peace of the adjoining British and Italian Colonies, does not affect the security of the French themselves who have no territorial interests in the hinterland to be endangered (see Appendix J). On the other hand, the French are known to be apprehensive of the effects of the influx of arms into their West African possessions (see Appendix o), and have recently invited us to co-operate in checking the traffic in those regions. The question is also likelv to piove acute in the new spheres of influence ' to be allotted to Fiance aftei the vai m Asia Minor and Syria, where French schemes of development must largely depend upon the acquiescence of the local population, and might be seriously hampered if the armament, and conse quently the powers of resistance, of the latter were increased to a formidable‘&gt; o ♦ extent. 1 he French may tind themselves, both in West Africa and Syria, under the urgent necessity of controlling the traffic ; and as British co-opera tion would appear to be indispensable in either case to the attainment of this object, His Majesty s Government will hold a strong counter for bargaining elsewhere. On the whole, we are of opinion that the materials exist for a reciprocal understanding between Great Britain and France, based upon genuine community of interest and the need for a combined policy in dealing with the question of the supply of arms to native races. Such an under standing, if it is to be effective, must, in our opinion, provide either— (i) for the cession of French Somaliland to Great Britain ; or (ii) it this is not iound practicable, for the total suppression of the arms traffic at Jibuti, or at any rate for its strict regulation on the lines of the proposed International Convention which forms the subject of paragraph 7 of this Keport. As regards (i), we iully recognise that French consent to the cession could only be purchased at a very high price, which would almost certainly take the form of territorial compensation elsewhere. The difficulties of effecting a solution on these lines, which we by no means underrate, are discussed in Appendix 2 (paragraph 4). The question of a suitable quid pro quo to France scarcely falls within our province ; but, having regard to the vital issues at stake, we consider that His Majesty’s Government would be justified in making heavy sacrilices to obtain the desired result. The question of the traffic in the French Settlements in India may also require special consideration. We understand that the Government of India are being asked to report on this subject. 7. International Convention regarding Africa, &amp;c. —Special measures arc necessary to regulate the traffic in what may be described as the “ danger zone,” i.c., those parts of Asia and Africa in which it is of special importance to prevent modern arms and ammunition from reaching the hands of the indigenous races. A “ zone ” of this description was estab lished by the Brussels u General Act ” of 1890, which prohibited imports, except under specilied restrictions, into the whole section of the African Continent lying between Lat. 20° N. and 22' S. An attempt was made at the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908 to enlarge the area of prohibition and to increase the stringency of the restrictions ; but, owing to the opposition of France, 1 no agreement was reached, although the draft of an ‘‘ Additional Act,” embodying the proposed changes, was accepted in principle by all the other Powers represented at the Conference. We consider that, following upon the conclusion of a general agreement between the belligerent Powers and of a separate understanding between Great Britain and France, an endeavour should be made to negotiate forthwith an international Convention on the lines of the draft “ Additional Act ” of 1908, with such additions and amendments as the altered circumstances require. A draft embodying the main provisions which such a Convention should, in our opinion, include, is printed as an Annexure to Appendix 4; a summary of the dralt “ Additional Act ” is printed as Appendix 5. The points in which the terms of the proposed Convention differ from those of the draft Additional Act are discussed in Appendix 4. We attach special importance to bringing under effective control (1) the import of arms, &amp;c., into all parts of the 1 The ch-aft “ Additional Act,” as first laid before the Brussels Conference of 1908 by the Italian delegate, covered the whole of Arabia, including Maskat and the Persian Gulf littoral, as well as an enlarged zone in Africa. The British delegates demurred to the inclusion of Maskat, on the ground that its peculiar conditions rendered it unsuitable for regula tion by international agreement, and that the better course would he^ for the Powers in treaty relations with the Sultan (viz., Great Britain, France, the Lmted States ana Holland) to authorise him to take his own steps to {control the traffic, this involved inter alia, surrender by France, so far as concerned arms and ammunition, of the rights of unrestricted freedom of trade with Maskat, acquired under her treaty with the Sultan of 1844. The French delegates refused to discuss the proposal at the Conference ; and though separate negotiations were instituted between the British and French Governments, no agreement could be reached. Pending a settlement of the Maskat question the French dec ined to proceed with the consideration of the draft “ Additional Act, which was accordingly never signed or brought into operation. See Appendix .&gt;. Xote S 349 ' ^ 2 ■0 of all consideration.

We desire to offer the following further observations m regard to certain particular localities . (a) Mask at. The history of the arras traffic at Maskat, the capital ot the Aral. Sultanate of Oman is suratnarised in Appendix 1. The situation in regard o the rathe, since the hitrodnction of the Sultan’s restrictive measures m 0)12 and their acceptance by France in 19 i 4, may be. regarded as generally satisfactory. But we still depend, for the continued regulation of the Maskat traffic, on onr power of keeping the Sultan up to his engagements; and our locus si and i lot effective intervention, in the event of failure on Ins part, is st, 1 qualified to some extent by the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, by winch the two Powers undertook reciprocally to respect the independence of the i ulei of Maskat and which, if we ever found it necessary to take drastic measures with the Sultan, might afford the French Government plausible grounds for objection.. The position is also complicated by the revolt which broke out m in 13 largely as a consecpience ol: the Sultan s arms traffic policy, and stdl remains Tmsuppressed in the interior of Oman. In all the circumstances, we think it desirable that steps should be taken to place the contiol of the Maskat arms traffic on a more permanent basis, and to strengthen the hands ot ; the Sultan in preserving order and maintaining Ins executive authority. W r e accordingly recommend : (i) that the French Government should be asked to agree to the removal of all restrictions upon our freedom of action imposed by the Declaration of 1802 ; . (ii) that the Sultan should be invited to place a British official in charge of his Customs and arms warehouse ; and (iii) that some permanent armed force, under British control, should be maintained in Maskat in the Sultan’s service. With regard to (i), we would remark that, while an arrangement on the lines proposed appears to us dcsivablc, we do not regard it as essential, from the point of view of the arms traffic, and would not press the point if the French Government demanded a high price for their consent. For the reasons given in Appendix 4 (paragraph 5) we are opposed to the inclusion, if it can be by any means avoided, of Maskat or any part of Persia or of the Persian Gulf littoral within the scope of the proposed international Convention. (b) Persian Gulf. (1) The Pirate Coast. —W'e consider it desirable, with a view to the more effective control of the arms traffic on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, that a British officer should be stationed permanently at some point on the so-called “ Pirate Coast,” preferably at or in the neighbourhood of Debai, to ensure the due enforcement of the arms regulations by the local chiefs. We recommend that this suggestion, which has been considered in the past on more than one occasion, should again be brought to the notice of the Government of India. (2) The Naval Patrol.—We consider that the post-bellum conditions will not be such as to admit of any considerable relaxation of the naval supervision of the Gulf waters, as exercised before the war; and we recommend that, as soon as circumstances permit, tin' patrol be re-established, temporarily atall events, until such time as the eilioacv of the gauged. new Agreements can be fully l.c; I'EKSIA. ^\ e consider that, whatever nrmnrrmvnui+a . t the Persian Gulf, it will still he of vital import-uice tirit'eT 6 *“ 3 | Iuskat - 0r watch Should he kept upon llte routes in Sou[h;riSa t e ^ l “ ntlm, °'1 ammunition have m the past re-irliorl Wnl • .

J ’ They may lie summarised as follows :— t) the Abyssinian Government must apply direct through the Legations to the Government interested, in the case of all future tenders for arms or ammunition ; (ii) when a tender has been accepted, the Abyssinian Government must place tlie business in the hands of the Bank of Abyssinia for completion ; (iii) private traders to be absolutely prohibited from dealing in arms and ammunition ; (iv) before delivery of any new consignment, the Abyssinian Govern ment must band over to the Legation concerned an equal number of old idles to be destroyed or disposed of in such manner as may be agreed upon ; and (v) the cartridges supplied to the Abyssinian Government to he limited to a fixed number for every rifle purchased. We would supplement No. (v) by the further condition that the annual supply of ammunition for rifles already in the country should be strictly limited. We would also add the general proviso that all applications on behalf of the Abyssinian Government must be made personally by the Head of the State, who will be held directly responsible for the due fulfilment of the above conditions. (See Appendix 4, paragraph 9.) (e) China and the Far East. We have been in consultation with Sir John Jordan, British Minister at Peking, on this branch of the question. We apprehend that nations such as the Chinese and Japanese do not fall within the category of “native races” as contemplated in our terms of reference, and that there can be no question of interfering in the internal affairs of organised Asiatic States enjoying full international sovereignty. Japan, as a bell igerent, would be a party to the undertakings suggested in paragraph 5. The same applies to China if, as we understand is not 1 1 We do not, of course, overlook the fact that Jibuti will itself fall within the area of prohibition under the new Convention. But it also fell within the zone defined bv the Brussels Act of 1890, and this fact lias not prevented the French, by a strained interpretation of one of the clauses of the Act, from permitting the traffic to proceed unchecked. It is of course to he hoped that the French will in future co-operate in the spirit, as well as the letter, of the new Convention; hut it is the barest prudence, in the light of past experience, to neglect no possible safeguard against evasion of its terms.i flip Allies.

Examples of the futihty ot a scrap o Papei, when it conflicts with the determination of an indy.dual State to act as it. interests or necessities dictate, are not far to seek, i he most that can ne expected of such agreements as we have recommendeil is that they prove reasonably effective for a certain number of yeais alter the 'ai, amt hat the principle of international co-operation, once firmly established, n a\ afford a valuable basis for such further joint action as future deielopnients may render desirable. But even this modest anticipation may prove undulj optimistic, unless real community of interest can be established between the contracting parties, or-failing that-unless His Majesty s Government, as the Power mainly interested in the Conventions, is m a position to enfoice the due fulfilment of their terms. In any case it is essential that the regu lations already in force in various parts of the British Empire (c-j., United Kingdom, India, Egypt, &amp;c.) for controlling the supply of firearms should in no circumstances be relaxed. On the contrary, there wdl e\er\ where he a need for greater vigilance, and for more stringent sateguar s against illicit distribution. 10. In submitting our Report we desire to place on record our great indebtedness to the skilled assistance which we have received from our Secretary, Mr. J. E. Shuckburgh, of the India Office, whose services throughout have been of the highest value. Islington. A. Henry McMahon. Edmond J. W. Slade. W. Tyrrell. H. J. Read. Lancelot Storr. S. S. W.

I rk ms oi' Reference. “ io consider the general question of the Traffic m Arms after the War with special reference to Native Races.” First meeting held at the India Office on Monday the 8th January 1917. Present: Lord Islington (Chairman). \ ice-Admiral Sir E. Slade (Admiralty). Sir William Tyrrell (Coreirjn Office). Major S. S. W. Paddon (War Office). Mr. H. d. Read (Colonial Office). Mr. J. E. Shuckblrgii (India Office) (tiecretarij). E I he question was discussed in its general aspect. The view was taken that, assuming Germany does not regain her African Colonies after the war, the only European Power whose interest in the arms traffic is likely to be antagonistic to our own is France. Mr. Read drew attention to the Draft Convention drawn up at the Brussels Arms Traffic of 1908-09, which contained the material for a satisfactory solution of the whole question, so far as Africa is concerned, but which was never signed owing to the opposition of France, although accepted in principle by all the other Powers represented at the Conference. The Sub-Committee was unanimously of opinion that an understanding with the French Government on the arms question should form part of the general settlement at the end of the war. 2. The question was then considered with reference to three areas mainly affected, viz.: — (1) Maskat and the Persian Gulf; (2) Jibuti and the East African littoral ; and (3) West Africa. MASKAT AND PERSIAN GULF. 3. As regards Maskat, which for many years served as the main distributing centre of arms, &amp;c., for the whole Middle East, the situation has been governed in the past by the fact that the local Sultan has commercial treaties with the United States (1833) and France (1844) providing for the unrestricted import and export to and from his territories of all kinds of merchandise, as well as a i: Commercial Declaration concluded with Holland in 1877, providing for reciprocal “ most-favoured-nation ” treatment between the two countries. The Sultan’s international position is further regulated by the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, by which Great Britain and France undertook reciprocally to respect the independence of the ruler of Maskat. Neither Holland nor the United States have shown any disposition to embarrass us by an assertion of their treaty rights ; indeed, both Powers agreed at the Brussels Conference to forego their rights in so far as the arms traffic was concerned, provided the two other treaty Lowers (Great Britain and France) did the same. Germany h not in treaty relations with Maskat. The great difficulty has been with 4 ranee, who up to 1914, declined to give up her rights under the Treaty of 1844, or to alhnv the Sultan a free hand to control the traffic, except on conditions which His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to accept. France, it should be S 337 75—3/17observed, had no very considerable share m tlie import trade m arms am ammunition into the Sultan's dominions; the chief importers 'ere Great Britain and Belgium, reinforced in recent years bv Germany. But the distributing trade at Maskat itself was largely m the hands of branch dealers, the most important of whom (M. Gpguyer, wdio .lied ... 1!)W) is believed to have had powerful interests at his back, which made it dill,cult for the French Government to interfere with him. 4 As far back as 1898 the Sultan agreed, at our instance, to prohibit the export of arms, &amp;e., from Maskat to India and Persia (where the import of arms was illegal) and empowered British warships to act on Ins behalf in enforcing his prohibition. But, owing to the attitude oi l'ranee, no restriction could he placed upon (1) the import ol arms into Maskat, or (- ) their export, except to the two specified countries. 1 he icsiilt was that arms and ammunition poured into Maskat from Europe, and were then smuggled across in Arab sailing vessels to the Persian coast, and^ ultimately found their way in large quantities to Afghanistan and the isorth-West Frontier of India, where' they fetched prices high enough to make the trade exceedingly profitable to all concerned, difficulties ol transport notwith standing. The Persian Government, though it had prohibited the import of arms, Ac., into Persia by a decree of 1881 (re-affirmed by a law of 1900), proved utterly incapable of checking the traffic in Persian territory. I he trade continued to flourish, and the arming of the North-West Frontier with modern weapons proceeded apace, until a situation aiose, as the t io\ eminent of India reported in 1909, “which has upset the balance of power, and constitutes a serious menace to the maintenance of peace. Mattels had, in fact, grown so alarming that, on the breakdown of the Brussels Conference in December 1909 (owing to French opposition), it was felt that drastic action could no longer safely be postponed; and, accordingly, at the beginning of 1910, a rigid blockade was instituted in the Persian Gulf by the British Naval authorities, with the object of intercepting arnis-bearing dhows on their way from Maskat and other ports on the Arabian Httoral to the Persian coast. * The naval blockade was continued without intermission until the outbreak of the war in August 1914 made it necessary to divert the vessels employed to other services. It was from the first markedly successful, and apart from the quantities of arms and ammunition actually captured, reduced the dealers’ profits to such an extent that all die European firms at Maskat save one (that of Goguyer, whose heirs carried on his business) were compelled to close their doors. But, regarded as a means of preventing the infiltration of arms from the Arabian to the Persian littoral, a naval blockade is admittedly a cumbrous and very costly expedient; for the purposes of the permanent control of the traffic after the war, some more direct and less wasteful machinery is clearly required. 5. A further important step was taken in June 1912, when the Sultan, acting on British advice, agreed to establish an arms “warehouse” at Maskat, under a special superintendent, and to issue regulations requiring all arms, Ac., imported into the country in future to be taken direct from the steamer to the warehouse, from which they might only be released under special licence for sale to approved purchasers. The “ warehouse ” system came into force on the 1st September 1912, and applied to all stocks remaining in the hands of local dealers on that date as well as to subsequent imports. The Sultan refused to entertain the suggestion, even as a temporary expedient, that he should place the supervision of a British official; but he stand that the continuance of the enhanced his arms warehouse under was given clearly to under subsidy, which was granted to him by the British Government in compensation for loss of revenue from the arms traffic, would depend on his abiding by his engagements : and that the official appointed by him to supervise the warehouse would be liable to dismissal if he proved inefficient or corrupt. A further condition was that suitable provision would be made for the bond fide needs of the Sultan s administration and subjects in regard to arms and ammunition.G. I liese measures, coupled with the success achieved by the naval blockade, seem to have brought the French Government to a more reason able frame of mind. At any rate, after some rather protracted negotiations, an agreement was eventually reached and embodied in Notes interchanged between bn E. Grey and the hrench Ambassador on the 4th February 1914 hy which, ill return for the British Government buying up the French dealers stocks lying in the Maskat warehouse, France “ renounced the right „ ol . voking, on behalf of French citizens and protected persons, the ll nv ' leges &lt;-onlewed on these persons by the Treaty of 1814, between hranoo and Maskat, m so far as such privileges and immunities are opposed to the regulations and laws for the prevention of the contraband t,a ' je 1,1 arm * an(l ammunition in the dominions of the Sultan of Maskat.” &lt;. I li&lt; position at Maskat is t hus that the difficulty caused bv the French tiea1\ ol 1 &lt;S41 has been got rid of ; that the hrench arms dealers have been bought out , and that the Sultan has heen induced to regulate the traffic on satisfactory lines. But it must be borne in mind that we still depend, for t|ie continued restriction of the Maskat traffic, on our power of keeping the Multan up to his engagements : and that our locus sLundi for effective inter vention, in the event of failure on the Sultan s part, is still qualified by the Anglo-hlench Declaration ol. IS(i2, which affords the brench Government plausible grounds for objecting to any action savouring of an infringement of the ” independence ” of Maskat. 8. 1 he Sultans present position is one of great difficulty. Ilis action in restricting the arms traffic was bitterly resented by a large number of his own subjects, and was unquestionably one of the main contributory causes of the rebellion which broke out in Oman in 1913, and which still remains unsuppressed. Sultan Turki, who was personally responsible for the warehouse policy, died in October 1913, soon after the rebellion had assumed serious dimensions; but his successor, Sultan Taimur, in spite of several attempts at negotiation with the rebel leaders, has not succeeded in re-establishing his position, and his authority at the present moment is virtually restricted to the coastal area in which his capital is situated. In the interior the rebels are masters of the situation. British Indian troops were sent to the Sultan’s assistance in July 1913, and have subsequently been reinforced more than once. But their role has always been confined to the defence of the capital and coast towns : and though, in January 1915, they repulsed with severe loss a rebel attack on the capital, they have never been permitted to follow the enemy into the interior. At the present time the British garrison in Maskat and the neighbourhood amounts to just over 1,000 Indian infantry, including 1^ British officers. 9. In the course of the discussion Admiral Slade urged that, with a view to securing permanent and effective control over the arms traffic at Maskat, the question of placing a British official in charge of the Sultan’s customs should be revived. This question lias frequently been discussed in the past; but the Sultan’s amour propre stood in the way, and for various reasons it lias never been thought advisable to press the proposal on bis acceptance. Its desirability, however, has been generally recognised. At present the Sultan farms out his customs, and there can be little doubt that the revenue derived from them would be substantially increased if they were placed under proper management. Admiral Slade pointed out that control o\ei the Sultan s customs - his one important source of revenue would carry with it an influence upon the general administration ol. Maskat, falling little shoit of a British protectorate over the country. The first step, in the opinion of the Sub-Committee, would be to obtain from the fiench Goa eminent the removal of all restrictions upon our freedom of action imposed by the Declaration of 1862 (see paragraph 7); this obtained, they considered that, given the conditions existing in Maskat, it would be iiecessai\, if the arrangement contemplated was to be (ffectrve, to maintain m the country sonic permanent armed force, under British control, in order to preserve order and to support the Sultan’s executive authority.

Admiral Slade further urged the desirability o! extending effective British influence over the “ Pirate Coast,” the strip of Araman coast Ivino- north-west of the Sultan of Maskat’s territory and forming the western shoulder of the Oman promontory. 'I Ins is the region occupied by the so called “ Trucial ” Chiefs (Debai, Shargah, 1 m-el-Kavvain, Ac.,, all of whom are in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and have undertaken to enter into no agreement or correspondence with any othei Power than Great Britain. All these chiefs formally prohibited the import •uid export ot arms and ammunition to and from their territories in . - , hut, there is reason to think that the prohibition has not always been effective, and that arms from Alaska! have Irom time to time been smuggled ;,.frx Pore In tlirniioli tliPir DOl’tS. JIBUTI AND WEST AFRICA. J J. The question of Jibuti was only cursorily coiishiered, the main dis cussion on this point being deferred till the following meeting. It was agreed that in proportion as the traffic is more effectually suppressed at Mask at, the more likely is it to increase at Jibuti, where the French Government (though they have agreed to prohibit imports during the continuance o[ the war) have never regarded it with an unfriendly eye. In fact, as Sir W . I yrrcll pointed out. the arms traffic is the main source from which the local French adminis tration derive their income, and the disappearance of the trade would involve an increased burden upon the French taxpayer, for the maintenance of the Colony, which would naturally he unwelcome to the Government at Paris. The ideal solution would be the transfer of French Somaliland to Great Britain, but the Foreign Office representative held out little hope that the French Government would entertain such a proposition, except on a basis of territorial compensation ; and in any case the Sub-Committee was in favour of keeping, if possible, the arms traffic negotiations separate from the question of territorial exchanges, in regard to which, it was held, we eoiild ill afford to sacrifice a single card in our hand. 12. Fortunately circumstances have arisen which hold out some promise of a satisfactory bargain with the French Government. The latter have quite recently (3rd November 191G) requested llis Majesty’s Government to take measures to prevent the traffic in arms between British and French territory in West Africa. Lord Grey replied (8th December 1916) that '‘His Majesty’s Government would be prepared 1o take action with a&lt; view to the prohibition of the arms traffic in West Africa, provided that „ 16 ^° vermnei i t would^take similar action as regards Jibuti and . f n f ti eSS1011 ! ln ml,a ; an(1 suggested that “advantage might &lt;( J ,e i k f , thls 0 PP 0 yt u mty to negotiate a general settlement of the arms tiaffic question on these lines.” As was pointed out at the Meeting, there is some reason to anticipate that the general redistribution of territory after the war will lead to a substantial increase of the French possessions m \\est Africa. In that event, the question of the arms traffic in those regions is likely to acquire an enhanced interest in the eyes of the French Government, who may in consequence show a more accommodating spirit in regard to the traffic in other parts of the world. 13. The discussion was adjourned to Mondav, the 15th January 1917 when it was decided to invite Sir Henry McMahon “to be present. 14. Major Paddon undertook to prepare a memorandum on the measures required to control the arms traffic on the Perso-Baluch frontier. {I hese Minutes were approved bij the Sub-Committee on the loth January 1917.) 15th January 1917.

Reverting to the subject of Maskat, Sir If. McMahon agreed that there would be advantage in getting rid of French rights under the Declaration of 1862, and thus removing all restrictions upon our freedom of action at Maskat; but he considered our position there to be strong enough already for all practical purposes. Me would welcome a “ free hand ” if it could be purchased cheaply, but was against paying a high price for it. Inter aha, a “free hand ” would enable us to develop the Maskat coal-fields, believed to be of some value. Sir H. McMahon also touched on the question of the “Trucial” chiefs raised by Admiral Slade at the last meeting (paragraph 10 of Minutes). This question has been raised in the past, but effective action has always been postponed. Sir H. McMahon thought it desirable that a British officer should be stationed at or near Debai to ensure the due enforcement of the arms prohibition. (There is already a Native Agent of the Bushire Residency at Shargah.) Sir E. Slade agreed. It was decided to include in any proposals submitted by the Sub committee a recommendation that this matter should again be brought to the notice of the Government of India. JIBUTI. 3. Jibuti (lat. 11° 35' N., long. 43° 9' E.) is the chief port of French Somaliland, a strip of territory about 40,000 square miles in extent on the north-east coast of Africa, nearly opposite the point of junction between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The French Colony is flanked on the north-west by the Italian possession of Eritrea and on the south-east by British Somaliland. On the land side it is coterminous with the kingdom of Abyssinia. Though barren in itself, the district is of importance as commanding the only possible direct railway route from the sea to Adis Ababa, the Abyssinian capital, from whence road and rail extensions with a radius of 150 miles would tap the three richest provinces of Abyssinia (Gojjam, Kaft’a and Sidamo), all of which fall within the British sphere of influence, as adjoining, respectively, the Soudan, Uganda and British East Africa. The French have built a railway from Jibuti to Adis Ababa (about 320 miles as the crow Hies), with a branch to llarrar. As regards the general S 337—2 75 3/17 A-r'l •„ to the arms traffic, the following extracts may b^quoted from a memorandum by the Untish Minister at Adm Ababa hm in Smnaliiancl and on the southern and Soudan frontiers, ho lone as it is held by the French, who have no territorial interests in heMiinterland to be affected, it will be used mainly as an arms depot from which to flood the interior with rdles and ammunition. The French have acted, and will, I thrnK, continue to act, loyally towards us in prohibiting the import of arms into Abyssinia during but the moment peace is declared, the existing prohibition will be raised, and the trade in arms will recommence on a scale such as we have never known before, and we shall be as nowerless to stop it in the future as we were m the past. . . . I he trade interest in France and the Jibuti merchants, who have been starved out during the period of the war, not to speak of the French Somaliland authorities, whose revenues depend for their surplus entirely on this traffic, will clamour to be allowed to makeup for the bad times they have gone through, and the French Government will, as before, be unable to resist this joint influence. Experience has shown that the French Legation [at Adis Ababa] always resoi . to a deal in rifles when in any difficulty. . . • e must thereloie anticipate in the near future an enormous influx of rifles and ammunition into Abyssinia, the effects of which will be elt on all our borders. The seriousness of this prospect cannot be disguised. The suspension of permits to import arms offers the only means of bringing pressure to bear upon Abyssinia, and this instillment is in the sole hands of France, who, although she has frequently used it for her own ends, will never surrender or utilise it for the common good, and, indeed,'could not do so for any length of tune without seriously damaging her commercial interests in dibuti, winch depend on this traffic, and her railway returns, which profit largely thereby ; and it must not be forgotten that it is on the combined prosperity of hese two institutions that her policy in Abyssinia is based .... France .... is not exposed to the same risk [as Italy and Great Britain], as 1 honestly believe that if any serious incident arose which touched her solely, an incident, that is, of such gravity that if Ureat Britain or Italy were concerned they would be forced to send an ultimatum, she could, and would, enforce reparation by the simple expedient of (dosing Jibuti to the import of arms unt il satislaction were granted. It is therefore evident that, while this tiaffic in aims is a serious impediment to any hope of reform in this country Vbyssinia], as well as a grave danger, not only to the neigh bouring British and Italian territories, but also to Abyssinia hersell, it is and will always remain for France, not only a source of immense profit, but a safe insurance policy against many possible contingencies. We can therefore, I consider, neither hope to accomplish any amelio ration in the condition of Abyssinia, or succeed in arresting the progress of illicit dealing in arms until French influence is eliminated in this country, and this can only be accomplished by exchanging French Somaliland for territory elsewhere . . . The Sub-Committee adhered to the view that the ideal solution would be the cession of French Somaliland to Great Britain. They fully appreciated the difficulty of reconciling the French Government to an arrangement which— (1) would involve not only the surrender of French territory, but also the sacrifice of French interests in the Harrar district and in Abyssinia generally (2) would deprive them of an important coaling station ; and (3) would cause the virtual disappearance of French influence from the Bed Sea.r vr&gt; nn -l Vml nf Fr l’ W l?SC unwilhu S ness &gt; in any circumstances,' to give up a }an] of riench soil is notorious, would certainly demand a very lug i price &lt;;r lese saenhees ; and there is small reason to hope that their consent could be purchased by concessions in respect of the arms traffic in othei parts of the uoild, or that they would be satisfied with anything short o. territorial compensation on a substantial scale. Nevertheless, how ever formidable.the difficulties, the complete and final cessation of the arms trallic at Jibuti is an object of such vital importance to British interests that, in the opinion of tae Sub-Committee, a strenuous endeavour should be made to achieve it by the only method likely to prove permanent, viz -—the outire elirmnatioii of French influence from Somaliland. The Sub-Com- mittee did not think it witliin Ifteir province to make suggestions as to the &lt;iuul pro quo to r ranee. But they considered that, having regard to the issues at stake, His Majesty s ( rovernment would be justified in paying a heavy price to obtain the desired result. ~). An alternative course (in the event of failure to secure the cession of the colony) would be to induce the french Government to close down the arms depot at Jibuti, or, failing that, to bring it under a system of restriction and control such as was contemplated in the draft Additional Act laid before the Brussels Conference in 1908. Such an arrangement, however, would involve the French authorities in heavy financial loss. Even with the revenues derived from the arms traffic, the colony does not pay its way ; and if this source of income were removed, its maintenance would impose a still heavier burden on the exhausted finances of France. At Maskat a settlement was eventually reached on the basis of a heavy cash payment (64,COOL) by Great Britain. It is possible that an agreement might be reached on similar lines in regard to Jibuti, though the sum payable would doubtless be much larger. But there is this material difference between the two cases, that at Maskat we are in a position (through the Sultan) to enforce the necessary restrictive measures, whereas at Jibuti we should have to depend on the good faith of the French Government in carrying out any engagement entered into. Sir \Y. Tyrrell emphasised the view, which was shared by the Sub committee generally, that we ought to be very cautious about paying compensation, in cash or otherwise, until we are quite satisfied that we are getting our money’s worth. A mere written agreement, if we are not in a position to secure its practical enforcement, may prove as valueless ns many another international “scrap of paper.” It would be desirable, in the Sub- Committee’s opinion, to say nothing in the first instance about compensation or buying out existing interests, but merely to press for the effective suppression of the traffic. Admiral Slade laid stress on the imporiance of stopping the coasting trade, and pressed for the insertion in the agree ment of a clause making it illegal for steamers to carry arms, Ac., from one port to another within certain specified areas, except under special licence. The over-sea traffic is less dangerous, as being easier to control. Speaking generally, the Sub-Committee realised that an international Convention, however skilfully framed, cannot be regarded as a permanent safeguard against the arms traffic. But it will be something gained, and may be expected to prove reasonably effective for a certain number of years after the war. It will also furnish a useful starting point for diplomatic action in the event of open violation of its terms by the l 1 rench authorities. It is essential, however, that, once an agreement lias been concluded, we should give convincing proof of our determination to enforce its prowsions. 6. Reference was also made to the position of the Italian Government, who are not less interested than ourselves in checking the arms traffic at Jibuti They took a prominent part at the Brussels Conlerence m advocating restrictive measures, and may be relied upon to support proposals for an international agreement on the subject. 7. Admiral Slade pointed out that conditions at the end of the war 'onld iffer materially from those prevailing at the time ol the Brussels Conle'ence 'he creation of an Arab State has introduced an unknown factoi, which S 837—2 A 2X micht in default of a previous understand,ng between the Powers nRested n T e new State upset anv international arrangements for the control of the arms traffic S.’r 11. McMahon explained confidentially the nature of the agreements concluded by the Entente Powers definmg them future spheres of nl nonce in Arabia and Asiatic Turkey Stated briefly, bnt.sh ,n luence will predominate on the Red Sea coast, and wd contmue, as heretofore, to be paramount in the Gulf of Aden, and on the Maskat. and Persian Gn f Uoral. In the interior we shall be in a position to deal with the Arab Ohio fa of the whole peninsula south of Palestine. French interests will predominate in Syria on the Mediterranean coast. 8 The arms traffic question is bound to engage the attention of 1‘ ranee in her new sphere. She is likely, for example to entertain projects of commercial development which may well excite the opposition of the loca Arabs—an opposition which will be formidable in proportion to the growth o tribal armament. In any case she cannot wish to see herself surrounded bv lanm numbers of semi-civilised tribesmen, armed with modern rifles and furnished with unlimited supplies of ammunition It will clearly be to her interest, to check the trade. This appears to afford the basis of a reciprocal understanding with the French Government, bir II. McMahon even su^ested that, if France continued obdurate on the Jibuti question, it would beTadvisable to connive at the establishment of arms depots by our own traders, say, one in Fgypt and another on the ^Vest African coast, from which we could threaten, or appear to threaten, those regions from which the French are particularly anxious to exclude the traffic, lie considered that a threat of this kind would be more likely than anything else to bring the French Government to reason. We should be in a position t0 S ay to them “ Close your depots and we will close ours. We are both “ faced with a common danger, which can only be averted by uniform action « b as ed upon a common policy.” The Sub-Committee agreed generally, with the exception of the Colonial Office representative who thought that, in West Africa, at any rate, the establishment of an arms depot of the kind suggested was out of the question. The view that the question of French interests in Syria had introduced a new and important counter into the game, of which effective use might be made, was accepted. 9. It is to he observed, however, that the Syrian question has an interest for Great Britain as well as for France, and that we ourselves are seriously concerned in preventing the influx into Syria ol large quantities of arms and ammunition, which might find their way through Arabia into Persia and Afghanistan. Communications in Arabia are already beginning to open out, and it is understood that Medina is at the present time being provisioned to some extent from Koweit and the Shat-el-Arab, via Nejd. Reports also indicate that the Euphrates route is being regularly used by the Turks for the conveyance of troops and arms. As has already been remarked, mere difficulties of transport and communications, however serious, are not sufficient to check a trade in which the profits are so enormous as are those of gim-running. 10. Turning to the more general aspects of the question, the Sub-Committee considered that an endeavour should be made at the Peace Conference to obtain an undertaking from all the belligerent Governments (including that of Germany and the other enemy countries) not to dispose by sale, in any circumstances whatever, of the surplus stocks of arms and ammunition remaining in their possession at the close of the war. In making this proposal llis Majesty’s Government might emphasise its importance as an indispensable step towards the attainment of an object common to all the belligerents, viz., the prevention of future wars. It is to be assumed that this object will figure prominently in the discussions at the Conference ; and it appears desirable to place in the forefront, among the methods of securing its attainment, the vital necessity of restricting the free distribution of modern arms and ammunition. The policy of permanent international co operation in this matter, if once firmly established, should go far towards securing the world against the recurrence of incidents fraught f iter r nank r i , T,,e as a high moral issim oT tL uZ^ be / aiSed at tlie 1W Conference The remarks made in para graph 5 as p 1&lt;( '.

The Sub-Committee then proceeded to consider Major Paddon’s Memorandum of the 14th January 1917 regarding the control of the arms traiiic on the 1 erso-Balucli frontier. Major Paddon considered it essential that the present force of levies (or some similar organisation) should be maintained in the Sarhad district after the war, or, alternatively that the sphere of activity of the recently-formed South Persia Rifles should be extended to this district; he also recommended the permanent retention of a half battalion of regular infantry (or two squadrons of cavalry) in the neighbourhood of Robat, ie., at the point of junction of British, Afghan and Persian territory. Sir II. McMahon, who agreed, pointed out that we must depend in the future on the South Persia Rifles to prevent the conveyance of arms along the South Persian trade routes into Afghanistan ; the northern routes will present no danger so long as it remains the policy of Russia, as in the past, to prevent arms, &amp;c., from reaching her own Muham madan subjects. The Sub-Committee endorsed the view that the prevention of gun-running in Persia will depend in future on the strength and organisation of the South Persia Rifles, whose sphere of action should, in their opinion, be extended so as to link up with British Baluchistan.

Sir Mark Sykes adhered to the statement made in his memorandum liat, art('i the war h ranee and Italy would still have 20(),000-:J00 000 black- pmv.ler, single-load,ng, ri fles at their disposal. They possessed a million apiece of such weapons before their troops were re-armed with magazine rifles! and these stocks have never been unloaded. Old-fashioned brass cartridges, chained with ordinary black powder, can be used over and over a^ain bv the simple process of re-capping. A single cartridge case can be made to serve tor 0-10 roulids. A modern magazine rilie with 300 rounds of ammunition is only worth oOO sliots ; but a Martini rifle with tlie same number of rounds lias a potential value of 0,000 shots. The main thing is to restrict the sale ol ammunition. This is perhaps easier than in the case of rifles. The latter can be smuggled about in separate parts which can be put together again without difficulty. The business is within the reach of numberless small traders. Ammunition, on the other hand, can be manufactured only by linns doing business on a considerable scale. What is required is an international agreement to control the manufacture and sale of ammunition under a strict system of Government licences. Sir Al. Sykes held that the vast increase and improvement of our warlike appliances (aeroplanes, armoured cars, machine guns, Ac.,) brought about by the war would enable us in future to deal with tribal risings, Ac., without -difficulty. The tribesman may be better armed than before the war; but his relative inferiority to disciplined troops will be much greater, thanks to the modern Aveapons which the latter will possess, and ivliich the former will not be able to obtain in any considerable quantity. Aeroplanes and armoured cars are not suitable objects for illicit trade ; machine guns doubtless can be smuggled, but their consumption of ammunition is so great that, if the supply of cartridges is cut off, they will he of little value to their possessors. As an example of the use to be made of superior armament, Sir AI. Sykes mentioned the desirability of maintaining after the war a systematic patrol by aeroplane of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf littorals. Sir M. Sykes considered that the most dangerous weapons are automatic pistols. He gave it as his opinion that, with the spread of railways and civilisation, the savage or semi-savage tribesman will tend to disappear, and the intellectual anarchist and revolutionary increase. Every endeavour should be made to control by international agreement the manufacture and sale of automatic pistols. S 337— a 75—3/17o SIR HUGH CLIFFORD. 3 Sir H Clifford stated that there are no modern rifles m the Gold Coast a „d Asdlanti; but there are some 160,000 converted flint-locks. These gims are regarded as aims ol preci ; .ioi 01 ?hrpurposes of the Brussels Act of 1890. The cap-gun is superior to the flintdock in that it can be relied upon not to miss the shoulder and admits of reasonably accurate aim. Ihere is no Uilhcufty in obtoining caps. Officially, only about four boxes of caps have entered British ports during the last 12 years ; actually, they aie freely smugs ei m, and can be readily obtained in the Colony. . . . , , r n , It would be very difficult to smuggle rifles of precision into the Gold Coast There are nine ports of entry (besides one, Lome, in logoland), but none are easy to approach owing to the very heavy surf. Lntry by night is impracticable, while in the daytime the presence of an European olhcei.m charge of the Customs is a guarantee against smuggling. No laigc consignment of rifles could tind its way in . The cap-guns cause no embarrassment to the authorities m Ihitish territory. It would not he fair to deprive the natives of these weapons, which m-e often needed, especially on up-country farms on the edge of the jungle, for defence against wild animals. It would be very difficult to call in the guns; and any attempt to do so would be sure to cause trouble. Increased import, duties would have little effect, 1 he cocoa industry has brought so much wealth to the Gold Coast that money has little value there. There would he no objection, however, to increasing import duties on arms, &amp;c., if only for purposes of revenue. (Sec note below.) But the present situation gives no cause for anxiety, so far as British tei ritoi } is conceined. It is true that a certain number of riots—one of them serious —occuired m 1914—15', but these were entirely inter-tribal in character and in no sense directed against the British Government. Sir II. Clifford expiessed the a eiy strong opinion, however, that a complete register of all guns in the Colony should be kept, and kept up to date, and that the supply should be efficiently regulated—preferably by making the Chiefs the only source of supply to the people. Wholly different conditions prevail in the adjoining french districts- (Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Dahomey). The French have to administer a large and unwieldy area, and in many places are not on good terms with the inhabitants. During the war they have had the utmost difficulty in enforcing military conscription upon the native population, and have only succeeded in doing so by very arbitrary methods, which have caused acute resentment. A very critical situation has arisen in some localities, and the French authorities are anxious to reduce by every possible means the power of the natives to- resist their administrative measures. For this reason they are unwilling to see their subjects armed with even the most primitive weapons, while the restriction of the supply of cap-guns has become a matter of such serious concern to them that they are likely to press very strongly for our co-operation in controlling the traffic. Arms for the most part enter the French colonies via British territory; few are landed at French West African ports where the provisions of the Brussels General Act are rigorously enforced.

'I'he Sh}j-(' ommitteerecorded tlie following;conclusions oil theeviilence of Sir M. Sykes and Sir H. Clifford : — (1) that it is of even greater importance to control the sale and manu facture of ammunition than of arms ; (2) that it is desirable to secure, by international agreement, a general prohibition of the export of ammunition, except under Government licence ; (3) that special precautions should be taken to regulate the sale, Ac., of automatic pistols ; and (4) that the interest of the French Government in stopping the arms traffic in West Africa is stronger than had previously been undersiood, and is correspondingly more valuable to us for purposes of bargaining. ABYSSINIA. &gt;. Some further discussion followed. Mr. Read read to the Sub committee the following summary of proposals recently submitted by the British Minister at Adis Ababa (Mr. Thesiger) for the control of the arms traffic in Abyssinia :— (1) the Abyssinian Government to apply directly through the Legations to the Government interested for tenders for all arms needed in future; (2) when a tender has been accepted, ihe Abyssinian Government to to place the business in the hands of the Bank of Abyssinia for completion ; (3) absolute prohibition to all traders to deal in arms ; (4) before delivery of any new consignment, the Abyssinian Government to hand over to the Legations an equal number of old rides to be destroyed or dealt with in a manner to be agreed upon; and (5) the establishment of a tixed number of cartridges to every rifle bought by the Abyssinian Government. These proposals would require the consent of France and Italy, as well as of Abyssinia herself. 6. The circumstances in which arms and ammunition are imported into Abyssinia ma J ibuti have Irequently formed the subject of official reports. The Brussels “ General Act ” of 1890, to which both France and Abyssinia were parties, imposed certain restrictions on the import of arms, Ac., into the portion of the African continent lying between Lat. 20 N. and Lat. 22 S. Within this zone (which includes Irench Somaliland and Abyssinia) any Signatory Power having occasion to authorise the traffic m its own teintoiies is required to establish a public warehouse under the control of its local administration, in which all imported arms must be depositee, and liom which they may only be withdrawn by special licence. 1 he Act, ho\\evei, contains an article authorising the transit of arms, Ac., thiough the terntoiy of a Signatory Power in occupation of the coast into that of anothei Signatory (or adherent) Power occupying inland territory without direct access to the sea, provided the goods are certified by the Government of the inland state to be required for Government purposes, and not destined for sale. In permitting the import of arms from Jibuti into Abyssinia, I ranee has ahvays claimed to be acting in accordance with the provisions of this Article. ut the Government of Abyssinia being what it is, the arms though nomina y imported for Government use, have in practice been available to purchasers of all kinds.4 7. An attempt was made at the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908 to stiffen up the regulations by substituting (in the (halt Additional Act laid before the Conference by the Italian delegate) the “ Head of the State ” for the “ Government ” as the authority m the inland state whose certificate is required before arms are allowed to pass. The object of this amendment, which was aimed specially at Abyssinia, was to fix personal responsibility on the then ruler of the country (King Menelek), to the exclusion of the numerous officials, Ac., who might be held (and were held by the Trench) to answer the description of the Gov eminent. the Conference of 1908 broke up without reaching any agreement, French opposition preventing the acceptance of the dmft Additional Act, to which all the other Powers represented at the Conference Were prepared to agree in principle. Subsidiary proposals for dealing with the situation in Abyssinia were also under consideration in 1907 - 08 . 4 hese proposals, known from their author (Count Colli, Italian Charge d’Affaires at Adis Ababa) as the “ Colli Scheme,” contemplated the absolute prohibition of the import into Abyssinia of all arms and ammunition other than those consigned to King Menelek himself, and covered by a personal certificate from him. private dealers were to be entirely eliminated. The scheme was never brought into operation. 8 . The position, therefore, is still governed by the “ General Act of 1890, which experience lias proved to be a wholly inadequate instrument for the suppression of the arms traffic. France has undertaken, for the 'period of the tear, to prohibit the import of arms, Ac., into Abyssinia via Jibuti, but in violation of the arrangement arrived at between the British, French and Italian representatives at Adis Ababa, a considerable consignment of arms and ammunition was recently sent from Jibuti to the Abyssinian Government. Both the French Minister at Adis Ababa and the French authorities at Jibuti profess ignorance of the matter ; but it is difficult to believe that the consign ment could have gone through without their knowledge. Directly the war is over, as Mr. Thesiger pointed out in a memorandum written in March 1916, “ the existing prohibition will be raised, and the trade m arms will “ recommence on a scale such as we have never known before', and we shall “ be powerless to stop it m the future as we were in the past.’ The results are likely to be most prejudicial, not only to the internal situation in Abyssinia itself, but to the tranquillity of the adjoining British territory (Soudan, British Somaliland, Ac.), and of the Italian Colony of Eritrea. 'There is also the danger that Jibuti will replace Maskat (where we have stopped the traffic) as the distributing centre from which arms and ammuni tion will find their way by sailing craft to the Arabian and Persian Gulf littorals, thus neutralising the effect of our settlement of the Maskat question with France (which cost us 64,000L in hard cash) and obliging us to maintain indefinitely after the war the very expensive arrangements intro duced in 1910 for patrolling the Gulf waters. 9. Mr. Thesiger’s present proposals are on much the same lines as the “Colli scheme ’ of 1907. They are only in the nature of a palliative. What is required, if permanent results are to be achieved, is a comprehensive agreement with the French Government for the control of the traffic. Brussels Draft Additional Act. 10 . 1 he Sub-Committee decided to examine the question whether the terms of the Draft Additional Act, in their present form, afford adequate machinery for the control of the arms traffic after the war ; and if not, in what direction i lie Act requires amendment. 1 Admiral Slade undertook to prepare a memorandum on this subject.

I he Sub-Commit tee considered Admiral Slade’s memorandum on the amendments required to render the Brussels Draft Additional Act of 1908 an adequate instrument for the control of the arms traffic after the war. . “• Mic Sub-Committee accepted Admiral Slade’s two main proposals viz. (1) that the prohibited area, as defined in Article 1 of the draft Act,' of Arabia (for reasons explained in paragraphs 5 and 6 , it is not thought desirable to include Maskat, Persia, or the Persian Gulf littoral); and (J) that the export ol arms from all signatory States to the prohibited area [u] tiiat tne export ol arms from all signatory States to the prohibited area, for other than Government purposes, should be made illegal. Asia Minor, Syria, &amp;e.—The case of Asia Minor, which will include the remnants of the Ottoman Empire, after the expulsion of the Turks from Europe, as well as the “ zones ” or “ spheres of influence” to be allotted to Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia, presents considerable difficulty. It will be necessary to bring into the agreement all the States concerned, whether holding territory in full sovereignty (as in the case of Turkey in the districts which she is allowed to retain) or exercising in varying degrees the rights of suzerainty, protection, Ac., as in the case of the other Powers mentioned, within the spheres allotted to them. Responsibility must be fixed in each case upon the supervisory Power, whatever the precise nature of the authority or supervision exercised. It may here be remarked that it ivill apparently be necessary, after the war, to recognise at least three distinct degrees of supervisory authority, other than full sovereignty, exercisable by Great Britain and other European Powers towards various Asiatic States and rulers, viz., ( 1 ) Suzerainty ; (2) Protection, as already exercised in the case of the Aden States, the Trucial Chiefs, Ac. ; and (3) that of Advisory or Supporting Power, as in the case of various Arab potentates who before the war owned a nominal allegiance to the Sultan of Turkey. No. (3) will vary in degree in different cases, and may need to be further sub-divided for purposes of accurate classification. To revert to the arms traffic, little opposition need be anticipated from Russia, whose policy has always been to prevent the supply of arms to her Asiatic subjects ; and there should be no great difficulty in establishing an identity of interest between Great Britain, Iranee, and Italy, all of whom will be faced with the problem of developing their interests in new areas, * Present at the fifth meeting only. A S 337—4 75—3 17N and among potentially hostile populations, whose power of giving trouble will largely depend on the extent to which they are effectively armed. As regards Turkey, it must be assumed that she will be in no position, after the war, to resist the united pressure of the hntente I owers. It is necessary to emphasise two points, both in regard to Arabia and to Asia Minor, tVc., viz.: — (1) that the interested Powers will be dealing with territories, e.g., their several “spheres of influence” in Asia Minor, cVx., in relation to which their authority will fall very far short of full sovereignty, and in some cases may be of a very vague and ill-defined character; and ( 2 ) that an international agreement in regard to^ these areas will be of little practical value unless it can be established that there is real community of interest between the contracting parties. For these reasons the best prospect of successfully controlling the traffic lies in cutting off the supply at the source by prohibiting all export of arms and ammunition to the territories in question. 4. Arabia. —The situation in Arabia is complicated by the new political conditions—of which the proposed international agreement must obviously take account—arising out of the emancipation of the Arabs from Turkish control. Responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the agreement within the various areas affected by the new conditions must rest in each case with the European Power exercising supervisory authority, in whatever legree, towards the particular area. 5. Maskat and the Persian Gulf. —The Government of India have in the past raised strong objection to the introduction into these regions, in which British influence has been paramount for many years past, of anything in the nature of international control. It was on this ground that Maskat was excluded, at the instance of the British delegates at Ifrussels, from the scope of the draft Additional Act of 1908. The principle is of equal application at the present day, though the circumstances are not quite the same. We have, since 1908, induced the Sultan of Maskat to establish, under our auspices, a system of control over the arms traffic similar to that contem plated in the draft Additional Act; and we have purchased the acquiescence of the French Government in the arrangements made. Provided it were clearly understood that no interference would be tolerated with the measures taken by the Sultan to control the traffic, and that responsibility for their due enforcement, vis-d-vis other Powers, rests solely with the British Govern ment, there might be no great objection to bringing Maskat within the scope of the proposed international Convention, particularly as the only Inter national body contemplated by the Convention, viz., the Central Bureau at Brussels set up by the Brussels Act of 3890 (the International Bureaux m the prohibited area, proposed in the draft Additional Act, may be dispensed with), is to be merely an agency for collecting and co-ordinating information, and to excicise no executive powers of anv kind. Nevertheless the balance of advantage appears to lie in maintaining the status quo at Maskat, undei \\ Inch the control ol the arms traffic is the exclusive concern of the local authonties and the British Government, and affords no pretext lor inteifeience bj any othei .1 ower m any circumstances whatever. . Similar considerations apply to the whole of the Persian Gulf, including both the Persian and Arabian littorals. There can be no question of abating in the smallest degree the claims of His Majesty’s Government, as formally asserted by Lord Lansdowne in 1903 and reiterated by n . ’'dwaid jrey in 1907, to the possession of special interests in this regmn. So far as the control of the arms traffic is concerned, sole and absolute authority throughout the Guff must rest with the British Govern ment. „ [n al f q® circumstances, it seems desirable tliat Maskat, Persia, and the iersian Gulf should, if possible, be wholly excluded from the scope of the international Convention. Hut it is essential that Great Britain should rke lull responsibility for controlliasr the triffle i„ h other Powers should be &lt;ri ven , l^ r * u m ‘''i 88 r «g' libition of to !“der S tand that w, undertake full that the tho prohibition of exports as'applying no “'an to the covered by the Convention. 0 Ule ions, and e regard territories Africa.-- As regards Afr prohibited area two regions in'the^tortLaXT'l ‘ 0 iuclud 1 e ' vi ? ii ' 1 tlje &lt;lraft Additional Act, viz., Morocco and the SpaniXooldT'.iast by - lhe difficulty is anticipated in either case. 3ast ‘ seiJ0,,s 8 . r n ie Iquestion was discussed of making the sale of arms &amp;c a &lt;,ocernmcnt monopoly conhned to the administrations of the smnatorv Powers, within the prohibited area Mr. Read pointed out that a suction on these lines had been made in 1898 in connection with the liquo%affic but had been abandoned as impracticable. A similar proposal, in remtrd to arms and ammunition, was submitted by the German delegate to the [Irussels Arms Conference in 1908, but was not incorporated fn the draft Additional Act. I tie proposal was criticised by the British delegates, in a despatch to the foreign Office, on the following grounds ( 1 ) that it constituted a totally new departure and might be difficult to reconcile with the general principles of commercial policy laid down by His Majesty s Government; (2) that Chambers of Commerce might hnd reason to complain that while the sale of arms was being restricted in British territories, other Governments were selling more freely, and that British merchants were Thus being placed at a disadvantage ; and ('B a complicated machinery, throwing an undue burden on district officers, would be required to give eifect to the proposal. Much has happened id the last nine years to modify public opinion in regard to State control over industry, and the objections raised in 1908 would not necessarily be of equal force at the present day. But there are other practical objections to the establishment of a system of Government monopolies in the prohibited areas, arising, e.g., out of the weakness of such states as Liberia, the special conditions prevailing in some of the British West African Colonies, Ac. In all the circumstances there seems no necessity to revive this proposal, as the object in view can be adequately secured by a system of effective State control on the lines of the draft Additional Act with the necessary amend ments, provided it is strictly administered and the responsibilities of the signatory Powers are honestly discharged. 9. It is not proposed to alter the provision in Article 1 of the draft Additional Act which authorises the transit of arms, Ac., through the territory of a signatory Power in occupation of the coast into that of another signatory (or adherent) Power occupying inland territory without direct access to the sea, provided the goods are certified bj’ the Head of the State in the inland country to be required for (iovernment purposes, and not destined for sale. The bearing of this clause on the Abyssinian question is discussed in paragraphs 0 and 7 of the Minutes of the third meeting. The substitution of the “ Head of the State ” for the vaguer 4t Government ” of the Brussels Act of 1890—fixing as it does individual responsibility on the ruler of Abyssinia—is undoubtedly a step towards more ellective control. Sir H. Ale Mahon instanced the case 'of Afghanistan where the Amir’s personal certificate is required for the importation of arms, Ac., from India, and has in practice proved hitherto an adequate safeguard against improper demands. But the circumstances of the two countries difler in material points ; and it seems clear that, in addition to the proposed international Convention, some special arrangements affecting Abyssinia, such as those recently formulated by Mr. Thesiger (see paragraph 5 of the Minutes of the third meeting), will be necessary in order to cope with the alaiming situation created by the wholesale influx of arms and ammunition into the country.

The control exercised is ta.rly eftective and there is the further safeguard that the amounts impelled are checked iiv the Chinese Maritime Customs Department, the personnel ot which is mainly British. From the Indian point of view, any large accumulation o arms in the border provinces of Yunnan and Szechuan might prove very inconvenient, and it would he advantageous if means could be devised of o-uardiug against such a contingency. In raising the question with t e Chinese Government, we could perhaps rely on the support of h ussia and France who, by reason of their interests in Mongolia and Indo-China respectively are 'not less concerned than ourselves in preventing the arms traffic in outlying provinces of China.

The experience ot' all nations who have relations with Africa and Western Asia having demonstrated the evil consequences resulting from the distribution of modern arms and ammunition among the Native Races of those regions, both as affecting the security and preservation oi such Races themselves, and the general interests of peace and civilisation ; and experience having further shown that the restrictions imposed by Articles VIII.-XIV. of the Brussels General Act of 1890 upon the import of arms and ammunition into certain parts of Africa have in practice proved inadequate for the proper regulation of the traffic ; now therefore the Powers, Xc., Ac., have decided that it is necessary further to restrict the trade in firearms and especially in rifled arms of precision, as also in powder, bullets, and cartridges, within the following areas, viz.:—( 1 ) the whole of the Continent of Africa, exclusive of Algeria, Tunis, and the territories of the South African Union ; (2) the whole of Arabia, excluding Alaskat and the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf ; (3) the whole of Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine ; and (4) all islands adjacent to these regions to a distance of 100 nautical miles from the coast.Article '1.

Apart from the Government’s own requirements, no arms, Ac., may be deposited in, or taken out of, the warehouses without previous authority from the Administration, which shall not be granted, either for deposit or removal, in the case of arms of precision, such as rifled firearms, magazine or breech-loading rifles, whether complete or in parts, or their corresponding ammunition. Special exceptions are permissible in the case of bond tide travellers, Ac., and of settlers who require arms for self-defence; but in all such cases the arms must be registered and can only be held under special permits granted for a limited period. No arms of the above descriptions may be placed in the hands of natives save in exceptional cases. Article 5. The sale of all arms and ammunition in every part of the areas specified in Article 1 will be brought under strict Government control. The Government of the Power responsible for the enforcement of the Convention in each Colony, Protectorate, or State within the specified areas— whether it holds the particular tract in full sovereignty or stands towards it in the position of Suzerain, or of protecting, advising, or supporting Power— shall determine the yearly quantity of arms and ammunition to be allowed in the said Colony, Protectorate, or State for the use of private persons.

(1) The Brussels General Act, 1890. -The draft Additional Brussels Arms Conference of 1908 was “additional” in the sense of being supplementary to the “ General Act” signed at Brussels on the 2nd July 1890. 1 he parties to the latter were Great Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, the Congo, the United States, France, Italy, Holland, Persia, Portugal. Russia, Norway and Sweden, Turkey and Zanzibar. Abyssinia, Liberia, and the Orange Free State subsequently adhered. Franco attached important reservations to her acceptance of the General Act, declining, inter alia, to ratify the Articles providing for the detention of suspected vessels and for their examination and trial. The Act ot 1890 dealt primarily with the Ma\e Frade ; but it also contained certain Articles (8-140, which were ratified by France, regulating the traffic in arms and ammunition in Africa within a specified area, viz., the territories comprised “ between lat. 20° N. and lat. 22° S M and extending westward to the Atlantic Ocean, and east- “ ward to the Indian Ocean and its dependencies, comprising the islands adjacent to the coast as “ far as 100 nautical miles from the shore (Article 8). ^ ithin this area, the Act icquires any signatory Power having occasion to authorise the traffic in its own territories to estab isb public warehouse under tbe control of its local administration, in which all imported arms ™iist be deposited, and from which they must not be withdrawn without special authority.

Pending a settlement of the Maskat question the Hrench delegates at Brussels umler orders from their Government, refused to proceed with the consideration of the draft Additional Act, which had been placed before the Conference by the Italian delegate, as re present in &lt;&gt;■ tl.e amended proposals of his Government; and the Conference, uhich uas adjourned on the 20th Julv 1908 and did not reassemble until the Hth December 1909, was linallv dissolved on the 31st December 1909, without reaching any agreement. I he Additional \ c t though nullified by French opposition, was accepted m principle by the dclegateh of all tlie other Powers reprasented at the Conference, viz.Great Britain Germany, Belgium Spain, the Congo, the United States, Italy, Holland Persia, Portugal Bussia, Sweden and Turkey, subject to certain reservations in the case of Germany, Holland, Spam and I mkey . With regard to the question of the transit of arms, &amp;c., through the territory ot a 1 ower in occupation of the coast into that of an inland State, Article 4 ot the Additional Act reproduces the terms of Article 10 of the General Act (see Note (1) above), but substitutes t he “ Head of the State ” (Chef tie Vfitat) for the “ Government of the Power (Courernement ,/e la Puissance) as the authority in the inland State whose certificate is required be lore the arms are allowed to pass. The object of this change, which was aimed specially at Abyssinia, was to fix personal responsibility for the import of all arms upon the then ruler of that country (Emperor Alenelek), to the exclusion of the numerous officials. Ac., who might be held (and were held by the French) to answer the description of “the Government. ll was hoped to impose a further check upon the traffic in Abyssinia by means of a separate agree ment to lie concluded between the Emperor Alenelek, Great Britain, France and Italy on the lines of the so-called ' Colli scheme,' particulars of which are given in Note (3). (3) &lt;4 The Colli Scheme,” —The main feature of this scheme, which was drawn up in 1907 by Count Colli, Italian Charge d’Affaires at Adis Ababa, was the absolute prohibition of the import into Abyssinia of all arms and ammunition other than those consigned to the Emperor Menelek himself, and covered by a personal certificate from him. To give effect to this arrangement, the Emperor was to issue an Edict prohibiting the traffic forthwith, and to take various steps to enforce the prohibition, to deal with arms already in the country, and so forth. The scheme was never brought into operation. J. E.

These instructions relate indeed only to one aspect of this question - that which is concerned with the Hedjaz - and on this Monsieur Cherchali has been informed that France, in full agreement with Great Britain, desires to maintain the independence of the Sherif and the integrity of his dominions, and further that the French Government hold that no European Power should exercise a dominant or even a preponderating influence in the Holy Places of Islam. His Majesty’s Government are in entire sympathy with the spirit which animates this declaration. They have, indeed, no wish to interfere v/ith the complete internal independence of King Hussein and their desires in regard to the Holy Places are confined to securing the un interrupted continuance and the safe conduct of the Pilgrimage. The general position in the Arabian Peninsula has been on more than one occasion fully recognised by Your Excellency’s Government. I would refer Your Excellency in this connexion to the assurance contained in the letter which •is Excellency Monsieur Gambon, &amp;c., &amp;c., n ■ &amp;c.v/Mch Monsieur Jules Gambon addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris on the 8th of December last, in which it is expressly stated that ’’the French Government consider, as in the past, that it is for the British Government, whose interest in the affairs of Arabia is preponderant, to furnish the necessary contingents &amp;c. ,f More recently also, in the Note communicated by Your Excellency’s Government to Lord Bertie on the 22nd May, relative to the withdrawal of the French Military Mission from Mecca, it is stated that 'the Government of the Republic are ready to admit that the proximity of Hfeypt and the Persian Gulf create in Arabia a peculiar situation in favour of Great Britain', and that 'France is detemined to abstain from any intervention in the internal affairs of the Arabian Peninsula'. The reason for these declarations is to be found in / the geographical, historical, and political position of Arabia in relation to the British Snpire, which is quite different from that of any other Pov/er. The Arabian Peninsula is bounded on all sides by British possessions or British spheres of influence. For more than 100 years Great Britain has been established upon the Arabian Peninsula, with responsibilities that extend along the coast from the Bed Sea to Koweit; and she is bound by Treaties with Native Rulers in Southern Arabia which impose upon her responsi bilities from which she could not, even if she would, divest herself; while the complicated network of tribal politics makes it impossible for her to ignore the trend of political events in other parts of the Peninsula. His Majesty’s Government have no desire to extend their sphere of political influence in Arabia, still less to assume a Protectorate over that country* Their wish is to diminish, not to increase, their responsibilities* But I need not point out to Your ExcellencyExcellency that there exists no more fruitful source of trouble in these semi-civilised countries than a condition of things in which tribal combinations can entertain the hope of enlisting one European Power against another« Nothing has produced a happier effect in the past than a strict delimitation of the spheres in which such Powers can legitimately exercise their influence; and His Majesty’s Government are convinced that the avoidance of internal strife in Arabia can only be secured through the retention by Great Britain of the influence which this country has for so long held throughout the Peninsula as the European Power most closely concerned with the internal peace and external politics of Arabia. I trust that the French Government will realise equally with His Majesty’s Government the dangers which would be entailed by any attempt to internationalize Arabian politics and that they will agree that the above solution is the only one which offers any certain prospect of order and tranquillity within the Peninsula. I feel sure also that they will welcome a clear statement of our views, as we appreciate the friendly frankness with which they have communicated to us their instructions to Monsieur Cherchali.

It may be added that the whole military and financial burden of the Rising has been borne oy His Majesty’^ Governments Though it is probably in the military and political interests of the Allied Powers that this exceptional condition of things should continue during the war, there is no reason known to His Majesty's;Government why it should continue when the war is over. When that event occurs, it is the intention of His Majesty's Government that the 'statusof the Hejaz should revert to the condition of complete internal independence referred to in the earlier part of this comnmica- tionr The position in the Arabian Peninsula outside the Hejaz is, however, of a differ ent character, as Your Excellency’s Gov ernment have on more than one occasion fully recognisedc I would refer Your Excellency in this connexion to the assurance contain ed in the letter which Monsieur Jules Gambon addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris on the 8thr of December last, in which it is expressly stated that ’’the French Government consider, as in the past, that it is for the British Government, whose in terest in the affairs of Arabia is prepon derant, to furnish the necessary contin gents, etc/' More recently also, in the Note com municated by Your Excellency’s Government to Lord Bertie on the 22nd r May, relative to the withdrawal of the French Military Mission from Mecca, it is stated that ’’the Government of the Republic are ready to ad mit that the proximity of Egypt and the Persian Gulf create in Arabia a peculiar situation in favour of Great Britain', and Jrtiatthat '’France is determined to abstain from, any intervention in the internal affairs of the Arabian Peninsula”* The justification for these declara tions is to be found in the geographical, historical, and political position of Arabia in relation to the British Empire, which is quite different from that of any other Powerr The Arabian Peninsula is bounded on all sides by British possessions or British spheres of influence,- For many years, Great Britain has been established upon the Arabian Peninsula, with responsi bilities that extend along the coast from the Fed Sea to Koweit; and she is bound by Treaties with Native Rulers in Southern Arabia which impose upon her responsibilities from which she could not, even if she would, divest herself; while the complicated net work of tribal politics makes it impossible for her to ignore the trend of political events in other parts of the Peninsula*!

V. 2.$ /f 2_ k JLkk }Jlij B. 247. BRITISH INTERESTS IN ARABIA. It is understood that a memorandum, is desired, explaining why the exclusion of Italy from Western and Southern Arabia and the Red Sea littoral is important in British interests. 1. The importance of Arabia from its geographical position, lying along two of the main approaches to India, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, is a commonplace. ISio part of the country can be completely indifferent to Great Britain, who is the only Power that at present has a foothold in the country. Our hold is limited to a narrow fringe along the coast, from Aden to Koweit; its security depends ultimately upon the tranquillity of the interior. Since we are unable to intervene in, or control, the interior, it is essential to exclude all possible seeds of disturbance. 2. Arabia is not a State in any effective sense, but a fortuitous concourse of tribes—more or less settled in the fertile regions near the coast, elsewhere wandering—under Chiefs, the limits of whose sway are determined, not by frontiers, but by the tribes which they for the time being control. Their politics are closely interwoven, and a quarrel may run right across the continent. With the tribes and Chiefs along the coast mentioned we have treaty relations. 3. In addition to this we occupy at Aden an area of 75 square miles with a considerable hinterland, the frontier of which, with the Yemen, has been demarcated. The Chiefs within this frontier are under our protec torate. 4. The strategical importance of Aden need not be emphasised. I he fortress of Aden is almost impregnable against tribal forces. In circum stances as they existed before the war we could hold it with a very small force, and control the protectorate by means of prestige and subsidies. 5. The Aden-Yemen frontier is a frontier quoad the lurks, not quoad the Arabs, who do not greatly respect it. Its demarcation was necessitated largely by the intrigues of our semi-independent neighbour the Imam of Sanaa, whom the Turks encouraged when it served their purpose, but could never effectively control when he chose to defy them. But we had recognised Turkish authority, and whenever some petty local incident occurred the only remedy was representations at Constantinople. Ihe Imam has pietty extensive claims on our side of the frontier indeed, they extend to the Hadramaut tribes on the coast the other side of the piotectorate. lo the north and north-east, where the frontier has not been demaicated, we are safeguarded by the great desert, the Ruba al Khali, and by oui treaty relations with the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, which, however, su ice only so long as the tribes of the Hadramaut hinterland are not tampeie with. 6. In addition to being a fortress, Aden is the gateway of a considerable land trade with the Yemen (worth before the war about o00,0U0L per annum). The construction of a railway from Aden to Taiz—desirable for political reasons as well—would make Aden the main outlet for tie la e o ic Yemen. If another Power is master of the Yemen, it will build a line from Hodeida to Sanaa ; Hodeida will become the outlet, and a c en wi ose e trade it already possesses. 7. It is the Yemen on which Italian ambitions are mainly fixed. The Yemen is as little a unity as Arabia itself, and when t ie nr ' is ejec ec rom Arabia it will fall to no one Arab master. 1 he Idnsi, we know, will c S 3589 •n i • i down to and including W#doid«, the Imam of Sanaa will clann the greater pan of the remainder, and there are certain Sheikhs (like Mavia) on our border whom it will be to our interest to maintain independent. \\ e have by treaty guaranteed the independence of the Idnsi in his own domain (undefined^ and undertaken to arbitrate between him and he Imam where hair claims clash. The Idrisi and the Imam are possibly irreconcilable adversaries, though the removal of the Turk may bring (hem closer together. 8. The Italo-Turkish war made Italy the most unpopular of the Christian Powers in the Moslem world, this unpopularity is enhanced by Italian methods of colonial administration, and by national characteristics— in particular by Italian treatment of the women of subject races, a point on which Moslem opinion is very sensitive. Moreover, the Iman has an especial ground for detestation in that Italy blockaded his coast, and supported the Trivial’ yv'iili nrms and nionev durinii the uai. 9. From the preceding description of the general political conditions it must be clear that the appearance of Italy in the \ emeu would create in Western and Southern Arabia a ferment which would not be limited to that region, and from which we, as the limitrophe Power, would be the chief sunsrsrs * Our consent to it would he resented by the (1 rand Shereef and by the Arabs as a breach of faith towards the so-called Arab State, and it is probable that this resentment would be shared by the whole Moslem world (including India) who would consider that, after having betrayed the Turk, we were now betraying the Arab. This would react unfavourably on our position at Aden, and our reputation as a louci fnendl\ to Islam. I ho Arabs have made use of our support against the Turks, but the}' do not like us any the more ; and when the I urkish danger is ienio\ed it is by no means certain that the brunt of their dislike will not in any case fall on us, and with redoubled force if it is thought that we have released them from the Turk (who is at least a Moslem) only to hand them over to the most hated of Christian nations. If the Idrisi, in virtue of his former connection, welcomes the Italians, it is certain that the Imam will oppose them. That will mean hostilities on our border, ending at the best in a precarious peace, seeing that the Italians will be far too exhausted to undertake decisive operations in the hills. With our experience of Italian relations with the Senussi in Cyrenaica, and of the resultant friction with Egypt, we may know wdiat to look for in Aden, and we may expect before very long to be ourselves involved in hostilities on, if not within, our own border. If, on the other hand, the Imam accepts Italian domination, it must be expected that part of the price he will ask will be the support (at least tacit) of his claims where they will not conflict with Italy’s, i.e., in our protectorate and in the Hadramaut; and against his intrigues we shall have no redress hut appeals to Rome, which are likely to be even less fruitful than were appeals to Constantinople. If these anticipations are well founded, it is clear that our position in Aden will have to be put on an entirely different footing. Instead of keeping a handful of troops in the fortress and exercising a weak control over the tribes by subsidies, we shall have to hold the Protectorate in force—and this is surely not a prospect which His Majesty’s Government can regard with equanimity. 10. The present war has shown the use that may be made against us of Islam. Arabia is of great importance in the Islamic world, not only as the cradle of Islam and the seat of the Holy Places, but also because its geographical position interposes it as a wedge between the Islam of Africa and that of India and the surrounding countries. 11. The ultimate success of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Middle East depends to a large extent on the transfer of the Caliphate from lurkey to Arabia. This in turn depends upon the possibility ofmaking the ruler of the Hejaz sufficiently strong to be able to pose as an 'independent sovereign. This again depends upon keeping the Christian powers at a sufficient distance. But an Italian occupation of the Yemen ou j ( j from the relations in which the two regions stand to one another— make Italy the mistress of the Hejaz. “ If A1 Yemen goes, Islam is gone,” an \rab Saiyid said to Colonel Jacob as long ago as 1912. These are some of the reasons for which we took the precaution of roviding in the Anglo-French Convention that “ the British and French “ Governments agree that they will not themselves acquire and will not “ consent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian “ peninsula.” For the present purpose a sphere of influence is equivalent to territorial possession.

Political. (1) to fdve a civilized and syrapothetic governnient to the Arab* and other non-Turkish races now living under the ottoman dominion* (2) to safefnmrd the nationalist aspirations and legitimate rights of the Arab people , B*sfcratagig« (1) to secure the trunk lino of communication through the Had bea from our Western to our Eastern Ijrapire* (2) to eecure the hues Canal and Egypt t*™ an y attack from the i^ast (3) to oafe-inaard our interests in the Persian Gulf and to open up Mesopotamia to our commercial ontcrprisa# (1) to discredit Uttoman political and religious influences outside Turkey* and (2) to reconcile the Moslem world to the future political decadence of Turkey and the decline of the The Hight Honourable Arthur James Balfour, G.M*, U*i\ etc., etc., f^tc.L @ l£ th» Ottoman Cali&gt;hate* 3. To the above (toiiideratq amat be added the necessity as far as posiible of eliminating causes of friction, now ana in the near future, between us and our present Allies, whether French, Italians, Russians or Arabians* It is evident that the realization of these aims will be dependent an the disruption, as a consequence of the war, of the Turkish Kapirs and the relegation of Turkey as the uoiainant Islamic Ltate* The retention of even a shadowy Turkish suzerainty over other than purely Turkish populations would, I am confident, prove not only a source of grave embarrassment to the future government of those populations by us and our Allies but would destroy the very foundations of the Arabian ideal* 1 feel there is no certainty that after the war German intrif^ue will cease to permeate Ottoman action, political and religious* It is also evident that if we are faith- fully to practise the principles of our Alliance against the Central Powers, and to submit proposals that will contaend theiasolves to the Allied Councils, the consent of the populations must be obtained to t,he form of government we shall prescribe for them* This desideratum presents less difficulties of achievement in the Arabian Peninsula, with the majority of the Chiefs in which we have already concluded agreements, and in Mesopotamia, where the majorities appear willing to accept the logic of events, than in byria* It is amongst the sophisticated but incoherent population of byrin, *ith its welter of interests, political, religious and economic, that the most acute conflict of opinion may be expected* ^ by agreement with France we have surrendered to th^ latterlatter the solution of the Syrian question but we are bound, 'like by the terms of this a^eemcnt and by our responsibilities, voluntarily assumed, towards the Arab peoples, to assist in arriving at a solution satisfactory both to the future administrators of the country ( i.e. the French) and to its inhabitants. In view of this responsibility I welcome the assurance given oy M.Pioot go King Hussein, at their recent meeting at Jeddah, that the French position in the Syrian littoral will be analogous to the British position at Baghdad. If, as I understand is the present intention, our Government at the latter place will possess an Arab facade, this assurance will go far to reconcile native opinion to a situation which does not definitely exclude the possibility at some future date of closer union between the various Asiatic Arabic states and populations. 7 At the same time it is very necessary to make a clear distinction between practical politics and propaganda or ideals: and I consider that, at the present juncture, schemes of unification or federation must be regrided as amongst the latter, and, as such, hardly worthy oi mention in international agreements or documents of to-day. I am of opinion, having regard to the diversity of the loe d. conditions, that the utmost we should attempt in this direction is a general agreeraent as to the administrative control to be exercised in our respective spheres and the grant of educational and other facilities for the development of the districts on progressive Nationalist (Arab) lines. An attempt at uniformity in matters of law, currency or education appears to me fore doomed to failure. £ The Anglo-French (Bykes-Picot) agreement is unsatisfac tory and inadequate in one, to n iy ;nind, all-important point ofof strategy. As pointed out in my telegrams I hold it to be absolutely essential, once the uominance of Turkey ( a weak Natal Power) is removed, that ee should deny to any other l uropean Power the possibility of acquiring political control or influence on the Kastern littoral of the Red bea. Uur position here must be unassailable or we run the risk of creating a •Baghdad (ailway* question in the led bea, the development of which i may gravely impair our relations with France and Italy and even menace the security of our Imperial system. Q. I fully appreciate the necessity of avoiding any action that would impair in Moslem eyes the hwnunity of the Hedjas and the independence of its King. But in view of tho fact that we have created, directed and finan^ ced the Arab revolt 1 see no difficulty in obtaining from tho letter by treaty, &lt;11 the termr of whicn need not be made public, such guarantees of preferential treatment as will prevent other European Powers, under guise of their } ilgrias 1 interests, from acquiring concessions to Uay land, create banks, build n railway etc., in the 1 edjas. 1 To this and it is obvious that ai^y claims by Prance or other l ower to most favoured nation treatment by the Bherifial Government must be strenuously ana ; mjcceasfully rtteiiind. /Oy The achievement of our 'moral' deaiuerftta is contingent, but by no raenne entirely no, on the strenpth ol the Allies' position nt the future fence Conference. It is also intimatsly linked up with the question of the future of the Caliphate front which, as a religious natter, we have rightly elected to stand apart: although we shall be well advised neither to ignore this question nor to underrate its vital bearing on all future political ii rr .ni a units.arr&amp;n&amp;mants* &lt; e should b« undor no illusion that # in pursuRiico of our scalar anti military policy, wo have eacaped reoponaibility, before our Moslem subjects and fcoslerao in general, for a new schism in the tunni world that has already taken away the custody of the Holy Places from the Government of the Ottoman Caliph ana must injure, if it Joes not wholly destroy, the latter 1 » authority* jl/ihe bulk of » oslem opinion which is neither friendly nor openly hostile to the action of the bherif of 1 eeea has cautiously reserved its judgraot, or the public expression of it, until the results of the Ohorif^ action can be more accurately f^uged* In thi» connection we shall do well to rertriraber tlmt an Arab Caliph or Imam buried away in the sands of the Arabian desert will appeal to i oslems nowhere* Unless stability is given to his position and torn to his dominion, and unless he is free, in appearance, from foreign ana Christian control, political or economic, he will be regarded by oslams aw* at most, a vain figure-head of merely ritualistic significance, and, at the least, a living emblem of the decay of Islamic ideals* In our private dealings with the King, and with his consent, we may conclude agreements differing little from those we have made with the Trucial Chiefs; but we must be careful to create ana preserve, for as long as may be necessary, the facade of an inde cadent Arab Empire and grant to its titular ruler the appanage of an Imperial btate, if we are to assuage oslera pride and reconcile x^oslem sentiment to the overthrow of the Ottoman Jflpire* /2 To s\x&amp; up ny recorusendations for irnmediate action (1) A vigorous and sustained offensive against the Turks in Palestine and byria that will forestala Turkish counter-offensive and finally prevent the' ^3' contingency of their pinning our troops on the Gaza front whilst reinforceraents are being pushed up to fcedina for the re-capture of Mecca.

Sykes's two memoranda separately submitted (P.2527-8), and I have kept it for a f~w ucij-s as I understood that he was writing a reply to Sir H. Wingate's criticisms. This has now been received. Undoubtedly the ideal thing would be that the He ^ aZ ' Jid ' fVilcle cf the Arabian peninsula should be under our sole political influence, as Sir R. Wingate and Captain George Lloyd desire. But as far as the Hejaz is concerned t,-is is impossible. The essence of our policy is that the .Ling is to be an independent sovereign, and the French are quicK to draw the logical conclusion (jjpage We cannot deny to him the right to have direct relations with any foreign power - and if we have to admit one, the more we admit the better - and we must rely on our own diplomatic skill to maintain our own political interests. That these are in fact paramount cannot be denied. They are presumably two-j.old. (1) If the King of the Hejaz becomes Caliph we shall have a situation which has never yet arisen and which we have always striven to prevent - the Caliph in direct relations with Indian Moslems. If Panislamism survives the war (and there is no reason to suppose that it will not), Mecca will be its focus, and a steady stream of influence will oe crought to bear on Indian and African Moslems through the haj. We shall have to be constantly on the watch to see that the Caliph does not fall under the influence of a Power capable of utilising Panislamism against us, a danger which will be somewhat reduced by the fact that Panislamism is apt to be a two-edged weapon, and that the interests of France Italy and Russi-e. - though on a smaller scale - are identical with^ith our o^n. |^It ^iould be interesting to speculate whether, with the growth of Indien self-government, the Indian Loslems will less easy to control. Presumably the Hindu eleriient ixl alw^yg be quick to take alarm at any sign of Moslem agitation, but it may become less easy to apply coercion - less easy, at all events, than (2) If the Arab State becomes a reality, Mecca will become of some importance as its Capitalj and though the constituent states will doubtless for many years be very loosely federated, it may be possible to carry on a certain amount of political intrigue from the centre which would damage us more than any other Power. This we shall have to exert ourselves to counteract. Cur political interests in the Hejaz thus appear to be mainly negative. There is in fact a certain analogy between the Hejaz and Tibet. We should like to see both 'sterilized 1 ’, but in neither case is it really practicable to play the dog in the manger. I think therefore that we must frankly admit in principle the right of France and Italy and any other Power that chooses to claim it (the U.S.A. had an agent at Jeddah before the war) to a political footing in the Hejaz, and limit ourselves to obtaining their recognition that our commercial and financial interests are predominant. If we use rightly the influence which these interests give us we shall get all we want in the political sphere^but competition will be inevitable, and we must make up our minds to it from tne first. The case as regards the rest of tne Arabian peninsula is not very different. Whether or not it was ever possible, it is certainly not possible now for this country to claim to exercise sole political control over it. It might^(since it will be many years before foreign relations are conducted through the King of the Hejaz) aLae be argued, by an-ebjoctor'-that the constituent parts of the Arab State are at present as much entitled as the Hejaz to enter into direct relations with foreign Powers. Some of them, it is true, have contracted out, but tneir agreements with become more or less responsive to external influences ana met e 01 us( / ~7 (^ ) t 1. ii iii iv, /t fo A/Q h^&gt; Cvri^ ^ (t&gt;Mj &lt;(j' (sC.

Yet our interests are very real m Asir, to secure control of Farsan and its oil, in the Yemen, as our neighbour, and as the richest region in Western Arabia, in the Hadramaut, as our neighbour, in iMejd, not only because it has now extended to the Persian Gulf, but also because of the pressure Bin Saud can put on Koneit and the Trucial Chiefs, in Hail, because on Bin Rashid's relations with Bin Saud depends the peace of Central Arabia, by which the peace of Mesopotamia^ Koweit and tne Trucial Chiefs may oe powerfully in^utfnood in the peninsula as a whole, because of its v. How are uu ue securear un the one hand the drench claims are limited to the Hejaz; and though they have expressed the view that no Power should obtain new territory or 'prestige politique' in Arabia (instructions to M. Cherchali p. 3), they have (1) recognised that its geographical position creates a situation in favour of our cornmercial interests of which account must be taken (ib). (2) recognised that its geographical position creates in Arabia M une situation particuliere en faveur de la Gde 'Bretagne”, (note of 22nd May, p.5). (3) declared that they are 'r^solus a n&amp; point intervenifc dans les questions 'Eolitiaues de la peninsula, Arabique' (instructions to M. Cherchali p. 2), and 'a s’abstenir de toute intervention dans 'les affaires interieurej de la peninsula Arabique' (note of 22nd May, p.5). On the other hand# ; the Italians (1) claim as betweenbetween Italy, France, and Gt. Britain, the maintenance • / / of w une situation de parfaite egalite politique et / / 'economique vis a vis de I’Etat ott des Btats Araoes . from this claim 'les droits acquiie de 1'Angleterre / 'a Aden et sur le Golie Persigpe' (Memo, of 11th May, para 10). The French admissions seem to give us all that we can reasonably want, and if we could get them consolidated in a single agreement we could be satisfied with them. The Italian claim was presumably made in ignorance f of the French attitude, since the French themselves do not literally claim perfect equality with us. In practice what the Italians want is free access to Asir, the Yemen, and possibly the Hadramaut. As to Asir, our agreements with the Idtisi are l- sufficiently satisfactory'to enable us to regard the Italians with a certain amount of equanimity. But the idrisi has extensive claims in the Yemen, and if he were to establish these with Italian backing he might become a nuisance to us in the Aden Protectorate, The case with regard to the Imam is different. Owing to his recalcitrance we have been able to make no agreements with him, and he is still at the disposal of the highest bidder, but, even if the idrisi establishes himself in the Tehama, the Imam will always be our neighbour in the highlands, and we shall be dependent on his good-will for the peace of the Aden border. We cannot surely allow any foreign Power to acquire predominant political influence in the neighbouring province, and must maintain our right to that as the limitrophe Power, The same considerations apply to the Hadramaut, where our treaties with the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla perhaps afford us sufficient protection. If these views are sound, the conclusions would seem to be: U) It Cu/ dy\ (z/r .&amp;:■ 1^4^- ywir^' ^ (h^iirm* &lt;fr\ tl(J\J, l. '■'y (111 U) that we should lormally recognise the French and Italian claim to equality of political footing in the Hejaz in return for a formal statement from tnem on the lines 01 the French admissions quoted above regarding our position both in the Hejaz and in Arabia as a whole, 12) tnat we should communicate to the Italians our agreements with the Idrisi, and inform them that we claim a special political and economic position in the Yemen and tne Hadramaut as limitrophe Power. Subject to their recognition of these, we would sign an Agreement on the lines of the Memo, of 11th May. At tne same time it would be advisable to correct a misprint in Art. 10 of the Sykes-Picot Agreement which may have dangerous consequences (it is reproduced in the same art. of the Italian Memo.). The word 'ou' has fallen out between 'lies' and 'sur', i.e. it should read 'dans les lies 'on sur la cote est'. As the art. stands any Power may It is perhaps worth mentioning that the French appear not to have made the correction in Art. 1. which was arranged oy exchange of notes, i.e. the substitution of 'soutenir' for 'proteger', for they quote it with 'prot/ger' on p. 5. huj tniurS hnj, J CmOusv /i/. tAcfi-.

Rightly or wrongly it was believed that the French were bound, under the agreements, to preserve the same policy of complete political and economic disinterestedness towards the Hedjaz as was expected, on the other hand, from H/M.G. in regard to Syria. It was eonsider- -e&amp; that the granting of independence to the Hedjaz was an action taken by H.l.G. in regard to one portion of the area in which they had acquired sole interest, but that such action did not open the door to interference on the part of those who had signed the treaties, or weaken the effect of the self-ddnying pledges undertaken in the original agree- -meats. In conformity with this belief we have in the last few months attempted to resist, and felt fully justified in resisting, any attempts at economic or political interfer- -ence by other powers in the Hedjaz. Not only was it in Cairo that this view obtained, for in conversations which I had recently with Er.Balfour in London and others at the Foreign Office, contentions which I have put forward, in regard for instance to banking questions in Jeddah, based on this view of the status of the Hedjaz, have been supported and action taken in amanner which proves clearly that the Hedjaz was considered to he a sphere under the sole influence of Great Britain. Conversations, however, which I have recently had with Sir Mark Sykes and M. Picot have led me to understand that the assumption that H.M.G. had acquired prior and exclusive rights in the Eedjaz under the agreements is an erroneous one. It now appears that the Hedjaz is not included in that sphere in which British interests have sole claim,. The Hedjaz is treated separately and as out- -side the Briti^i area on the score of its independence, and it would seem to he only too clear that nothing in the actual wording of the agreements in any way forbids the French from exercising equal influence and from seeking for equal political and economic advantages with ourselves. All that is claimed in palliation of this position is that toy virtue of a letter appended to the agreeaents - a kind of oodioil - it is laid down that negotiations with the Sherif shall toe carried on through the sane channels as heretofore, namely through British channels. (It should here toe noticed that the codioil here referred to has no value of any kind in practise unless it means that the parties to the agreement other than HJi.G. are to have no representatives in the Kedjaz. If they are to twve representatives it is clear that their only raison d’etre would toe to negotiate with the Government to which they are accredited; on the other hand, It seems impossible that there should he no foreign representatives at the Court of an Independent Sovereign)• If the rendering of the position of the Ked^az in the agreements is substantially correct I submit that the situation thereby caused is a highly unfortunate one, of3 so^ne political danger and one that demands close investiga- -tion and revision. It is superfluous at this stage to re state the great importance to us, 'both from a strategical and political point of view, of isolating the Hedjaz as far as possible from interference at the hands of Powers other than ^reat Britain. It is ridiculous to suppose that H. I.G. would have spent the largo monthly sums of money and incurred large other military expenditure in the creation of the new state there for so questionable a result as has so far been obtained under the agreements. Equally certain is it that we should not havo been justified in incurring the very serious political risks vis a vis the Moslem world which we faced successfully during the last few months had it not been fully understood that our action was to result I in our acquisition of an unique and privileged position in that country. There has so far been every evidence that the French have interpreted the agreements as permitting them to exer- -eise what influence they can, both politically and economi- -cally, and it is equally clear that this French policy has been authorised from Paris. Their attempts to introduce new French Banking, or to consolidate old facilities; their suggestions for the building of a railway and, more recently, their inclusion of the Hedjaz in the area of General Bailloud T s inspectorate, long after the question of French military assis- -tanee to the Sherifian cause has been ruled out by events, all demonstrate this fact plainly. This is a situation which, in my judgment, goes far to vitiate the ^hole value of the agreements from a British point of view. The Southern area without the Hedjaz consists mainly of valueless desert, while the 'A” zone acquired by the French4 1 ' not onl ' 7 ver y large tut eonelsts of valuable harbours such as Beyrout and Alexandretta - territories capable of great economic development and peopled by races of economic ability and enterprise. It is pertinent to remember that 10 years ago Lord Cromer,with the full support of H.M.H. , was prepared to face a war rather than permit a situation to arise which would allow a great European Power to acquire a foothold in i.he Gulf of Akaba and the maritime immunity of the Ked Fea and Indian Ocean from hostile craft is largely attributable to his policy. Today, by the establishment of an independent area on the Bed } ea littoral unbalanced by any privileged position for Great Britain we shall have much weakened our position in this respect, without gaining any corresponding advantages and we shall further have paid for the privilege of so doing ourselves. It is urged that it would have been impossible to limit the Sherif to sole negotiations with Great Britain in a manner similar to that imposed by us upon our trucial chiefs in the Persian Gulf - That this would have weakened his position as an independent Moslem leader and have caused him to be regarded as a mere puppet, There is much strength in this contention, although it falls to the ground if the codicil has any force; nor is there anyone who counts in the Islamic world who ignores that the Fherif derives his support from the money and the arms of Great Britain. But admitting the force of the contention the same objective could have been attained by other means, that is to say by obtaining pledges that other Powers would not enter into any negotia tions with the Sherif on any economic or political matters unconnected with the normal routine of pilgrimage and that5 in all other matters they recognised the Hedjaz as a sphere of solely British influence. It appears to me that it is not too late to effect this - and I am fortified in my belief by a conversation which I had recently with M, Picot. M. Picot informed me that he was very anxious to know whether I was satisfied personally with the agreements and whether I considered that they would work well in practise. I replied that I could only speak for myself, though I was confident that the views I held represented pretty faithfully the attitude of others more responsible .than I was. If he wished for my views I should give them very frankly and say all that was in my mind, for I considered that some of the / minor difficulties which we had recently experienced were probably due to lack of complete understanding of one another*s point of view. I viewed the acquisition by Prance of Pyria and Alexandretta with complacency under certain conditions. I 4 could not disguise from myself that they had obtained an area of iianense strategical importance, which not only introduced a new and powerful Baval factor into the Eastern Mediterranean, but went far to nullify the value of Cyprus to us. It was equally clear to me, from such studies as I had made of the economic position in these areas, that Prance might be able to shift the watershed of Mediterranean as against Indian trade from Diahekir to the doors of Baghdad and possibly to the detriment of our economic position. But as Indian strategic questions were the main decisive factors that influenced us in the politics of these areas, and as I understood that these agreements virtually • defined all areas south of a line drawn from Hebron to Khoi SanjakA I,,r ” lir 1 oonelflerad a fair quid pro quo. “* ?iCOt interVened t0 rerrlar k that the wording of the agreements did not coincide with what X had Just said, and I replied that I was surprised to hear this, hut that in any case this was certainly the spirit of the agreements and I was convinced ay self that this was an understanding of them. in the other hand, recent happenings in the HedJaZ f0r instanco had rae uneasy as to whether the spirit of these agreements was really going to be kept. M * Pieot said that he would candidly agree that , whilst the wording was less generous than that which I had considered it^he did agree as to my rendering of the spirit of the agreement. I replied that I was glad to hear him say so - for myself, I should he very hostile to the agree- -ments if this were not the case. If we were left in sole and complete political and economic influence in the Hedjaz and in all that area south of the Hebron-Khoi Sanjak line I considered that it uould be our duty, not only to refrain from any interest of any kind in theM' area but to do . more - to do all we could to assist the French in that area. But this would involve a similar attitude on their part and would mean a complete withdrawal on the part of the French from our area and the cessation of any attampts to obtain an economic foothold. l,i. Picot then mentioned the question of the Bank in the Hedjaz and said that he had heard that I had been anxious in regard to it. He said that he did not understand this in view of the fact that the Ottoman Bank was an Anglo-French undertaking already existing in the Hedjaz. I replied that it was bath the method as well as the existence of the Bankr - *which had caused m anxiety. The claims of the Bank had been put forward somewhat unfortunately and, further, I considered, speaking frankly, that the Ottoman Bank w a s in effect a purely French concern in these areas; officially this might not be so, but actually it was so and I was lonfident th^t he would agree with me. M. Picot said he was in substantial agreement with me as to this but he had no idea that we viewed it in this light. He himself agreed with me as to my rendering of the general spirit of the agreement and now that he understood our view he would take steps to secure the complete elimination of French influence and competition in the Hedjaz. This ended the conversation. I repeat, therefore, that I consider that it is not too / late to remedy the defects of the agreements in a manner which would clear up the vshole situation. I think the moment is opportune and that the presence in Cairo of Sir lark Sykes • and '1. Picot would be of material assistance in aiding the * High Commissioner in achieving the desired results. In any case our position in regard to the area in general and the Hedjaz in particular seems far too indefinite to be satisfactory or safe. Experience shows too clearly that ambiguous situations are exactly those which are pro- -ductive rather than destructive of friction and in an area \ such as this in which Islam is so deeply concerned it is of the highest importance that the future should be secured in a clear and definite manner.
