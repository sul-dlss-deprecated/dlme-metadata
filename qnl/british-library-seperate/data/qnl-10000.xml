One of the slain Iraqis was a member of the Sa'dun tribe of Iraq and so his killing sparked a lengthy disagreement between members of this tribe and the al-Sabah. This disagreement and British attempts to mediate are discussed at length in the file.In addition to correspondence, the file contains a document prepared by the Political Agency in Kuwait titled 'A Note on the Activities of Shaikh Subah Al Nasir Al Subah' (folios 6-7).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d5#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
