The issue arose in 1942 following representations to the British Government by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) concerning the company's employees and property. The papers indicate that BAPCO's concerns about war damage may have subsided by January 1943 (folio 107).The papers include: circulars concerning the British Government's official 'Scorched Earth Policy', 1942; correspondence from BAPCO, the Government of India; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent, Bahrain, and HM Treasury; India Office minutes and correspondence; copies of relevant Government of India legislation (including
                           The War Injuries Ordinance, 1941, the War Injuries Scheme, 1942, and the War Injuries Regulations, 1942, folios 183-204, and the
                           War Injuries Compensation Insurance: Act, Scheme and Rules, 1943, folios 5-21); discussion of the question of what assurances should be given to BAPCO and the rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait, 1943; correspondence concerning the level of compensation payable by BAPCO to their British Indian employees, 1943; and correspondence concerning the protection of civilian property, 1945.There is no correspondence dated 1944.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Insurance</topic></subject><subject><topic>War compensation</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000206#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000206#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
