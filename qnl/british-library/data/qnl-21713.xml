Sultan bin bac^i* ? rfiiiler of Sharjall,when he called on board K^M.SFOwey, if he had received any reply from Shaikh sa'id bin namad of Kalba# Shaikh Sultan replied that he had recently redeived a reply from the Shaikh of Kalba in which he refused to allow a land ing ground at j^alba on the ground that he was afraid to allow one at i^alba lest others might create trouble for hinu The P.R. asked the uhaikh of oharjah why the ohaikh of Kalba was afraid. The Shaikh replied that he vms always on bad terms with the Sharqiyin and that it was possible that when there is a landing ground at i^alba they, in order to put him into trouble, would do some mischief for which he would be held responsible. j.he Shaikh said that he had tried his best to induce the ohaikh of j^alba but was not successful ihe said to the shaikh of Sharjah that as he claimed Kalba to be under him, could he not make the Shaikh of Kalba obey his orders# Hie Shaikh of Sharjah replied that Shaikh Sa r id bin xiamad of Kalba was an old man and that he respected him like his father and,therefore, did not like to hurt his feelings, xhe Shaikh added that even if he intended t o take action against Shaikh Sa r id bin namad of Kalba, he had to use force which he could not do for want of men and money and because of the difficulty of finding his way to Kalba which is surriunded by mountains, which made access to r^alba very difficult. But that supposing he could collect force to fight against the Shaikh of Kalba such force would have to pass through 5/adi al Ghuar, which is under the onaikh of /^as al xvhaimah. Xhe F » k . said to the ohaikh €€ Sharjah that supposing he was sent on a sloop, would /-2- fa would he then be able to make the Shaikh of ^alha listen to him* xhe Shaikh made some evasive and ambiguous replies and finally said that he would advise the Shaikh of ^alba and that if he did not listen to hiai advice, the &gt;ok)vernment could then take whatever action they considered fit for the purpose of achieving their ends. Ihe said to the ohaikh that if he could not arrange this matter he had to find some other person, and asked the ohaikh if the Shaikh of i^alba would listen to the shaikh of xias al Khaimah. ihe shaikh of oharjah replied that he was not certain, but said that the Shaikh of xias al ^haimah was on better terms than himself with the ohaikh of j^alba. nusain said to the r # K» that before his death Shaikh oultan bin ^aqr, the grandfather of the present Shaikh of Sharjah divided his country among his sons in accordance with the genealogical table attached, and that the Shaikh of oharjah since then ceased to exercise any authority over j^alba. ihat the Shaikh of Sharjah did not want to admit this fact sdaicKk in order that he may not show any weakness on his part, ne added that the ohaikh of ^alba had an intimate friend by name Ahmad bin Hasan who is resident of sharjah and asked the if he could send him to sound the Shaikh of Kalba. ihe P.H. agreed that Khan oahib wasain should send Ahmad bin iiasan to salba, provided he did so in his private capacity and not as a messenger from the Government* After the ^haikh of Sharjah had landed, ishan oahib 12.3.1936SECRET• Ref.

In addition to normal maintenance at the Rest House and aerodrome certain major services will probably be carried out during the approaching financial year. These are as follows (1) Wireless. It is proposed to install a new transmitting station, the exact position has not as yet been settled but it is believed that it will be placed 900 yards to the North-west of the fort and worked from the fort by remote control. A new D/P station on the Adcock system is also contemplated. The siting of this station will be approximately 900 yards North-east. A Marconi Engineer and one from Imperial Airways will assist in settling the exact sites sometime ^during April. (2) Meteorological. Quarters for the staff of a complete meteorological station will have to be built. Plans are not yet available but a proposal has been put to the Air Ministry to extend the area of the fort. (5) Nev/ Condensinp; Piant. It is proposed to install a new condensing plant and this will be housed in the existing fort. (4) The proposed additions are designed so that the end wall can be removed and further additions added. It is probable that accommodation for a further 12 passengers will be required. ^ 0 (5) Slight alterations will be required in the alignment of the barbed wire fence. Yours sincerely, Col.

That, fortunately for the Shaikh^they (the Royal Air Force) now want a small facility at Halul i.e. a beacon for guiding aircraft which is self-tending (i # e. requires no men in attendance and only requires inspection about 3 or 4 times a year}. That 22 years ago the ^Lawrence 1 * erected a cairn on the Island, and that the proposed beacon, besides being of assistance to aircraft will be found more useful than the cairn for the Abu Bhabi dhows.

You cannot also say the amount of money and the number of guards required by you in the absence of Haji Ahmad bin Hasan. I understood that you have another thing which you mentioned to me verbally.

With regard to our conversation^of yesterday in connection with the Government object to construct for the aeroplanes as necessity arises namely:- landing Ground, Godown for petrol. House for passengers when alighted from the aeroplane, a beacon for aeroplanes guidance at night, moorings- one or two through which no damage is sustained by us. There is no objection. I would agree if you agree to the terms whicn I require from the Government. That p. certain charge/should be paid for each thing. As r for money and arms this will be agreed upon later. That Government should leave us in our liberty and independence and not to interfere in our country^affairs. That all constructed on our ground would be our property and under our control. This will be governed by other terms which will be mentioned in the presence of our friend Haji Ahmad bin Hasan because he was the man who entered into negotiation with me in this connection. He should be present also you and JChan Sahib Husain bin Husain Amad. If the terms are granted then the matter will be settled in your presence and those mentioned above after three weeks from this date. Usual Ending.Telegram. From Political Agent, Bahrain.

Hickinbotham, Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain, the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Landin£ Ground at Kalba, Sir, I have the honour to report the result of my visit to the Shaikh of Kalba# A brief report together with a copy of my Ijtter of the SOth May to the Shaikh and his answer thereto form enclosures to this com- mnication. After the usual exchange of calls I explained the requirements of His Ifeijesty's Government tdjthe Shaikli. He asked if I was informing him of the whole of the requirements because he said when negotiations were first considered a petrol store and landing ground were the only requirements and the beacon and moorings etcetera were additional. I assured him that as far aj I knew I was giving him a con^lete list of the facilities that His Majesty 1 s Government hoped to obtain* The Bhaikh then stated that there was no objection to these facilities being granted# *5# I endeavoured to obtain the terms on which he was prepared to grant the facilities, but at first he would not discuss the matter at all in the absence of Haji Ahmad bin Hasan of Rams# it appears that Haji Ahmad has been his friend for years and the Shaikh places/'1 s . places great faith in his advice. It is desirable to mention that the Shaikh is an old man who has not been into the world* He has performed the pilgrimage which has been his only excursion outside his own area as far as I could ascertain. He was very nervous and obviously afraid of committing himself in any way. He was shy and most unwilling to discuss any point or give any answer without consultation with his friend Haji Ahmad. Unfortunately Khan Sahib Husain has only visited Kalba once before and that was in 1325 at the time of the bombardment of Fujairah. Our negotiations would have been easier if the acting Residency Agent had had the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the Shaikh since he would have been able to reassure him with regard to our honest intentions. 4. It would be tedious to describe the course of the arguments but after prolonged conversations he gave his terms as stated in his letter. In addition to his vritten request he made several verbal requests which I have noted below. The Shaikh's written requests are forj- (a) Guarantee for non-interference in his domestic affairs and the government of his country, (b) Constructions to be his property (he has introduced this on the analogy of the Sharjah agree ment) . (c) Rent for ground and moorings. (d) A charge for buildings. In addition to the written terms noted above the Shaikh mentioned the following conditions verballyj- (a)z. ' (a) Recognition of independence and a gun salute. (b) Guards. (c) Assistance in the event of a serious attack. He is particularly desirous of being recognised and having a salute fired when he visits a warship. I gathered that he ^as afraid of being absorbed by Muscat. I am not in a position to coraent on this request for recognition of independence because I have not the records with me which I would like to examine before making any recommendation. If you desire my views I will forward them after X have considered the problem in relation to Sharjah and Muscat. In regard to the guards# I do not think that a large demand will be made because things are fairly quiet now, but at the same time- although the Shaikh is not afraid of a definite attack he is afraid of pilfering of Government property for which he would probably be held responsible. The Sharqiyin are not actively aggressive and the Shaikh is averse to taking any definite action against them for minor misdeeds. He would rather pay thep to leave him in peace. 5. I consider that it is desirable to have the details of the air faciJJfcies required as soon as possible i.e. the position of the beacon / type of accommodation for passengers, size of petrol store, and the number and position of seaplane moorings. The/\v\ 4. The seaplane Baoorings may be difficult to arrange as fishing rights will have to be considered# Severe winds blow, the coast is quite open, and there is often a heavy swell which may make moorings impracticable. The advice of an officer of the Royal Air Force is essential as it will be a waste of valuable time to negotiate for facilities which for practical reasons will be useless. I left with the understanding that I would return in three weeks' time, possibly with an officer of the Royal Air Force, and that the terms- would be finally settled. In the meantime the Shaikh will consult Haji Ahmad and in order to facilitate the consultation I have instructed Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan Amad to send him to Kalba. I have also told Khan Sahib Husain to point out to the Haji that the Shaikh 1 s demands Mist be reasons able and that the more reasonable they are the more likely are they to be acceded to* In conclusion I wish to mention how very helpful Commander C.F.B. Bowlby of His Majesty's Ship Deptford has been in assisting the negotiation in every way possible. Medical facilities were provided and several serious cases were treated by Surgeon Lieutenant Cooke and drugs and medical supplies were gliven to the Shaikh. I have the honour to be.

After Compliments* With reference to your telegram Ho.68 dated the 15th June 1936, x beg to state that Flight-Lieutenant Iterant arrived on Wednesday evening the 17th June 1936 accompanied by two officers of the Royal Air i ^'orce and a Marconi Engineer. On their arrival I met them at the aerodrome and called on them in the morning of the following day. On Thursday the 18th June 1936 they inspected the grounds surrounding the aerodrome. They selected the grounds situated in the triangle about 700 yards north east of the aerodrome. Their intention is to erect there four pillars in a quadrangle the length of each side would be 300 feet. I enclose a sketch of the site and the direction selected. There Cp Mo ' are no buildings nor plants at all on this side. 2. Flight-Lieu tenant Mckoletts and Squadron Leader J. T. Paine asked me to arrange for their Journey to Has ul Khaimah and also to accompany them as they wanted to discuss Y/ith the Shaikh (a) about his request for the shifting of the boat from its present place to a place situated to the east of his (Shaikh's) house and (b) about permission to place maiks on the ground on which the Royal Air Farce aeroplanes alight when they visit Has ul Khaimah. I arranged with them to go by launch on Friday / morning the 19th dune 1936 and ?/ired you to this effect. As promised they came on ii-iday morning to proceed to Has ul iQiq-iTn ah and informed me that they wished to go to Has ul Khaimah by motor car instead of by launch in order to save time. informed them that though there was no danger the road was not safe and I had no authority from you to proceed by land, xhey said that they will undertake the responsibility. I at once arranged for two motor cars for them also three guards and I left with them forHgS Khamah at 6.30 a.m. &gt;Ve reached there at 10 a.m. As the road ws.s bad one of the cars stack in the sand and we continued our journey in one car. We found the Shaikh waiting for us because I sent him a message on Thursday. The Shaikh received us with quite a cheerful welcome. After coffee was served •flight-Lieutenant xjickoletts spoke about the Shaikh's request for the shifting of the boat from its present place enquiring from him (a) whether the place which the Shaikh wants to place the boat in is good and what is the depth (of water). He (the Shaikh) said that the water is 2-3 fathoms deep at ebb-tide, that it is better than the present place because it is far from the plying of dhows and is safe thereof. Plight-Lieutenant Mickoletts permitted the Shaikh to shift the boat and the guards 1 quarter to the place suggested by him and that this should be done in the presence of the Agent, xhe liesopotamia Iran Corporation Limited and (b) he to id the Shaikh that the aeroplanes camot recognise the ground on which they land at Sas ul Jihaimah and asked for permission to put marks on the ground for their guidance, xhe Shaikh said there happened what had happened in the past that is that he does not get anything on account of the alighting of flying boats in his countiy. Shat he gets is Hs .lOO/- for payment to the ^ards out of which nothing goes to his pocket. As regards the aeroplanes, xhis is an act of courtesy on his part to allow their informally and that if they want to put marks or take other measures they should arrange for an agreement between him and the Government in this connection. As Flight-Lieutenant Mickoletts was not authorised to have a long discussion in the matter he confined himself to this extent, ^e Shaikh also &lt;li&lt;i not say anything further. W e returned from Has ul K h aimah at 3 o'clock and arrived by the two cars at 7 p .m. I did not info™ the Shaikh of Sharjah about the inspection ^ the Said 0mcers llor about the site selected by thembecause the site is near and they inspected it without the Shaikh's knowledge. As I was not sure whether you wished me to inform the Shaikh about it and as the officers wanted to keep the matter secret pending submission of a report to their headquarters i request you kindly to let me know if you wish the Shaikh to be informed about what had happened or not. usual i&amp;iding*I?' 61/42 Telegram XK From His Majesty*s Secretary of atat@ for India, London# To Political Resident at Kuwait, Copy by air mil to Govermnent of India, Foreign and Political Department.

As for his claim to Ealba. On general principles if a Shaikh has for many years ceased to exercice any control over, or to acept any responsibility for, an area under the de facto rule of another ihaikh, I am of opinion that the formesr loses any claim he say once have had to the area in question. Kalba moreover as will be seen from the map is on the other side of the Peninsula and is not contiguous to *marJah territory, in these circumstances i think we may safely conclude that Shaikh of Sharjah*s claim to Kalba ia extinct.

It will be observed that the Sheikh of Kalba is now more favourably disposed towards granting the air facilities desired by the Air Ministry, and that the Political Resident is accordingly pursuing negotiations with the Sheikh with a view to concluding an Agreement in the near future. It is understood that Mr.Hickinbotham and a Royal Air Force officer are visiting Kalba to confirm the facilities required and discuss with the Sheikh the question of payment in respect of rental and guards. I am to enquire whether the Secretary of State for Air agrees that the Sheikh may be informed as proposed in paragraph 2 of the Political Resident's telegram of 6th June in regard to the ultimate disposal of buildings^ 3. Subject to the concurrence of the Air Ministry and Foreign Office, the Secretary of State would propose to deal as follows with the remaining questions raised in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Political Resident's express letter of 22nd May and in his telegram of 6th June. There would seem to be no objection to authorising the Resident to/ The Secretary, Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2.ull In o r i 2. to address a letter to the SheiKh. dealing in the manner suggested with the points mentioned in paragraph 6 of that express letter, so far as they have 'been raised or may be raised 'by the Sheikh. His Lordship further sees no objection to making a gift of rifles to the Sheikh, should they be asked for; and he agrees with the Political Resident as to the attitude to be taken towards the Sheikh's request for a gun salute. Lord Zetland also suggests that recognition of the independence of the Sheikh might be conveyed to him either orally or in the letter suggested above. It has been ascertained that, in view of the fact that the Sheikh of Sharjah has for many years had no control over Kalba, Colonel Fowle is satisfied tha,t there is no objection to this course* as the assurance given to the Sheikh of Sharjah regarding his lands in paragraph 2 of Colonel Dickson's letter of f ft&gt; £ 22nd July, 1932, could not be held to apply. Another * point, however, which seems deserving of consideration is whether recognition of the independence of Kalba should not be made conditional on the Sheikh accepting in terms all the treaty obligations at present binding the Sheikh of Sharjah, for instance, the Exclusive Agreement of 1892, and, \if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agrees, the Resident will be consulted on this suggestion. // /^/ 4.

Your proposals dealing with request for rifles and gun salute are approved. 5. Financial terms should be the most favourable obtainable on similar lines to Sharjah agreement providing for rent for landing ground inclusive of site of buildings etcetera tank etcetera, and for setting off of rent for cost j of construction until final vacation. Buildings would then become property of Shaikh but not buoys or moorings.

After Compliments, With reference to correspondence ending with iny telegram No.485 dated the 27th July 1956. 2. I proceeded to Abu Dhabi on Wednesday 22nd July 1956 and stayed there for 2 conplete days during which time I made acquaintances with Shaikh Shakhbut, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, his brothers and the headmen of his relatives. On the third day I informed ^haikh Shakhbut that I had a little work and I liked to talk to him about it. He asked all present to go out, but his brothers Haza, Khalid and 2aid and his cousin Muhammad bin Khalifah and his adviser and Minister Ahmad bin Kahalf bin Itaibah. I spoke to him about the erection of a beacon at Halul Island. He replied that his uncle was away at Braimi and as he is in place of his father it was impossible for him to decide such matters in his absence. I replied saying that the matter is simple and that it is not an important one which may be kept pending Shaikh Khalifah 1 s advice. I told him that I am sure that Shaikh Khalifah is one of these who would render great help to Government in this matter and would have nothing contrary to the Shaikh's opinion if he decided to grant the Government this facility. The Shaikh insisted on keeping the matter pending the arrival of Shaikh Khalifah. Thereupon I suggested to the Shaikh to go through the case till the evening when we shall discuss again. All present there were in my favour. The Shaikh went out on the understanding that we woulc meet in the evening. As the Shaikh acts according to the advice of Ahmad bin Khalaf bin Ataibah whose advice is by the Shaikh in all matters I asked him to have his lunch with us. After the lunch was served I spoke to him and asked him to advise the2-1# - 2 - advise the Shaikh to grant this facility. He went to the Shaikh and in the presence of his brothers and mother discussed the matter with him advising him to the effect that on account of such facilities the friendly relations, between him and the High British Government to whose kindness he is indebted, would be increased. When I visited the Shaikh in the evening Ahmad bin Ataibah hinted to me that the Shaikh had agreed to grant this facility and that he would let me know in the morning when he visits me as usual. On Sunday 26th July the ^haikh visited me and said that he was sorry that he was unable to accede to Government's request in respect of this facility and his contention was that he is afraid that by so doing he may get some injury. The the discussion took about four hours and at last he agreed to/ erection of a beacon. I asked him to write a letter on this subject to the Honourable the Political Resident. I at once dictated the letter to him and asked him to sign it lest that he may change his mind and then I wished him and left. 5. Though I did not get his concurrence at first when I spoke to him I did not mention to him the contents of (j~o paragraph 2 of your letter No.C/B40-7/2 dated 14th May 19S6 lest that it may displease him and make him nervous when he may not agree .to permit the erection of the beacon. 4. As Shaikh Shakhbut permitted this facility freely I suggest, subject to your approval, the Honourable the Political Resident may send him a reply thanking him for the assistance rendered by him to the High Government in this connection. Ahmad bin Ataibah who assisted very much in making the Shaikh agree to this, also deserves thanks. Usual Ending.Translation of a letter dated 7th.

I beg to inform you that Khan Sahib Saiyid Abdur Razzaq, Eesidency Agent Trucial Oman Coast, arrived here and discussed with me the question of His Britannic Majesty's Government desire to erect at Halul Island a beacon for the guidance of aircrafts and that this beacon would tend by itself and requires no attendants except that it may be inspected three or four times in a year. As I am desirous to assist the High Government and facilitate their works I accede to the High Governments request and permit them to erect without any remuneration a beacon for the guidance of aircrafts in my Island Halul.

The principal correspondents in the volume are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle, the Political Agent at Bahrain, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, and his deputy, Captain Tom Hickinbotham, Husain bin Hasan ‘Amad, in charge of the duties of the Residency Agent at Sharjah until May 1936, and his successor as Residency Agent, Sayid ‘Abd al-Razzaq.The volume’s correspondence deals with a number of proposals for facilities (including landing strips, wireless stations, accommodation, petrol stores, beacons), in particular an aerodrome at Kalba, but also extended aerodrome facilities at Sharjah, a renewal of the lease for the petrol storage facility at Ra’s al Khaymah, a seaplane anchorage for Imperial Airways in the lagoon at Umm al-Qaywayn, and a seaplane anchorage at Dubai creek. The correspondence chiefly concerns the negotiations between the Residency Agent and the various shaikhs of the region, on permission for the British to install facilities along the coast as part of the improved air route to India. Correspondence also documents arrangements for the survey of potential sites, and the construction of facilities. The proposal for a landing strip at Kalba occupies the largest proportion of the file; a result of the shaikh of Kalba’s initial resistance to the proposal, and questions over the extent of his independence from the authority of the shaikh of Sharjah, and British recognition of this independence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00000f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
