A Few Noteff- : The Abu Dhabi Petrol aim Company Ltd., welcomes you as its guest and hopes that you will have a pleasant and memorable trip today. You are now about to leave f®r the Trucial Coast where the A.D.P*C. Ltd,, an associated company of the Iraq Petroleum Company Ltd., is ©perating in the State of Abu Dhabi onshore, A 0 D,P,C. Ltd., should consequently not be mixed up with A.D.M,A B Ltd (Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd) which company is owned by B ,P,/C ,F,P, and operates in the waters of the Gulf , ite, off shore. The capital of Abu Dhabi is named Abu Dhabi and is situated on an island on the N.B. part of the Coast and which is oonnected to the mainland by a causeway along which the coastal roads enter this island. The State is ruled by the Ruler of Abu Dhabi - SheiJda Shakhbut ~ who has his residence in Abu Dhabi town. The total population of Abu Dhabi State is given as 15,000 in 1964, The topography of the State introduces a great number of difficulties with respect to moving about. The shelf area is very shallow with numerous islands lying offshore surrounded by more; or less deep channels - coral and mud flats making access from the sea very difficult., The mainland has a more or less wide coastal belt of sabkha 1 s (salt flats) separating the sea from the done covered interior. These dunes often the shape of belts increase in' height further inland until they tower some 600 - 700 feet above ground level in the South and South-East in the so-called Liwa- area. The Liwa is recognised by a series of settlements the population of which comes and goes depending an the time cf the year when the dates have to be pollinated and eventually harvested. The Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company has carried on the search for oil in the Sheikhdom in first instance under the name of Petroleum Development Trucial Coast which was changed to its present name when Murban field was taken into production. Geological and Geophysical field surveys have been carried out for some number of years and especially geophysical progress has often been difficult due to) the severe terrain conditions, Geophysical, exploration is still being carried out by two; seismic Parties contracted from General Geophysical (Bahamas) Ltd.. although the surveys are now more in a phase of detail, the regional coverage having been completed recently. The two crews are presentXy operating in the neighbourhood of Tarii 1 and may possibly be seen from the air. The search for ©il proved to be successful after the completion of Murban 2 during the first half of 1959, when oil and gas were found to be present in the upper part of the Lower Cretaceous Thamama formation. The field was drilled up from the compsuy 1 s'.'base camp at Tarif and Santa Pe 1 being the drilling contractor. 24 producing wells were completed allowing an off-take at a rate of 6 million tons a year (6 m^t a a e ) , Contc/,..•- 2 - Piro duotian faoxli.'fcl.eg ax'o one aremo'te sepaxa'tor ai: Shanes to which 7 wells of the northern part of the field are hooked into. The partially degassed oil is then transported 'by a 16' line to the main degassing and sweetening plant at Habshan, For easy reference two sketch drawings are; included in the hand-out which in a way are self-explanatory. After processing the oil in Habshan, it is then transported to the Company 1 s terminal in Jebel Dhanna through a 70 mile long 24' pipeline. Oebel Dhanna itself is a salt dome which is very well noticeable on the surface and advantage was taken of its topographical elevation by building 6 tanks each of 250,000 barrels on top of it. All tanks are filled and emptied at the same time and &amp;ie to the elevation advantage gravity feed into the tanker is possible. From the tank farm 2 X 4B : ' land lines transport the crude oil through the two P J), meter banks from where the oil flows again through 2 X 48' lines into 2 X 3b !f sealines terminating at the headers at the two offshore births* Not shown on your map is the. Bu Hasa station which has now been recently completed. This station is intended to degas the oil of the Bu Hasa dome which will then flow through a 24' line consteating with the 24 n mainline some 21 miles north of the station. Testing of the station is still in progress* Roughly speaking i ton = 7 barrels. For your 'benefit we advise you that the Iraq.
