(62/1/44). Sir With the Cempliment* of the Under Secretary of SUM for Foreign Affaire Sj 36J, BEITISH LEGATfLON, 3rd| MS N 1944 .944 ^ v 7/&lt; I have the honour to inform you that Dr. Benesh, President of the Czechoslovak kepublic, who arrived in Tehran from Russia on December 28th for a stay of two days, was the guest of His Majesty the Shah and the object of a display of official regard which suggested that the Persians wished those connected with the Tehran Conference to see that Persia knows how to treat official visitors when she is allowed a free hand. Dr. Benesh was met anu seen off at the aeroarome by the Shah, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Shah's suite, ana a few other officials not including the Prime Minister. The palace of the ^ueen-Mother was placea at his disposal, and he there received, besides nis own community and the press, the Persian cabinet and the heads of the fox’eign missions. Dr. Benesh gave a private interview to my polish colleague who seems to have gained some slight consolation from his talk. 1 also had the pleasure of being received by Dr. Benesh in private. What he said about his conversations in kussia was a repetition of the information given to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires in Moscow (paragraph 1 of Intel No.254 of December 19th). I was able to congratulate the President on the growth of unity among the Czech community in Tehran since the aays three years ago when a small Czech committee used to meet secretly in His Majesty's Legation and concert measures to counteract the pressure exercised by the German Legation in order to induce Czechs to take out Protectorate passports. 2. Dr. Benesh received an honorary degree from the University of Tehran, ana he was given at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a dinner at which the Shah and the Queen were present. Among the guests were all ehe heaas of missions in Tehran, except the Swiss Charge d'Affaires, whose government still has no relations with the Czechoslovakian Government. The Shah and the President made speeches copies of which, as reported in the Journal de Tehran are enclosed. 5. In the interview which he gave to the press the President referred to his appointment as arbitrator by the League of Nations in the Anglo-persian dispute about the Anglo-lranian Oil Company. He praised the Shan, the architecture of Iran and the ked Army, and he spoke with confidence of a speedy Allied victory. 4. The visit, which was remarkably well managed, must be considered to have been a great success ana it gave the Shah, the Government and the Persian people great satisfaction. Messrs. Skoda, who have a large branch in Persia, hope to nave a large share in any works to be executed in this country after the war and their chances have probably been increased by the visit of their president, who made an excellent impression. I am sending copies of this despatch together with the enclosure to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Moscow and Baguau, the Minister of State at Cairo ana to the Government of India. I have, etc., (Signed) k.v».
