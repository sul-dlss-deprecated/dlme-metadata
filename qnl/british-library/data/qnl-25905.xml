O.T.P.r Under Secretary/of State Secretary of fftate ^ta / ia\] ^ ,r &gt;. 12 ' V/ 7 TT We recently heard from H*M* Ambassador Istanbul (via the - Foreign Office) that General Giles the Gomnanding General of the U.S« Forces in the Mediterranean, with a £ number of American Officers, had invited a party of Turkish Military ~ Officers, including the Deputy Chief of Staff,.to visit India, China and Bimna by air. On receiving this information it seemed hwwlffio us that the Americans should take it upon themselves to invite a party of Turkish Officers to visit British territory without apparently bothering to consult any British authority beforehand. We accordingly asked the . Foreign Office to request H.M. Ambassador Istanbul to warn the Turkish Government that- the party would need Indian visas before entering India apd we, at the same time, consulted India by telegramf Simultaneously the Foreign Office sent a telegram to the Political Adviser, S.E.A.C., asking for * SAG SEA* s views. Our telegram to India wps crossed py one from them (flag M A') stating that they had been approached by the U.S. Commissioner in India asking them to agree to the visit of the party which was stated to consist not only of the Americans and the Turks, but also of Prince Peter of Greece. The telegram stated that the party were due to leave Cairo on the 21st July and to spend a few days in Ceylon en route via India to Chungking and to sp%nd a day or two in Delhi on the Way back to Cairo. It seems probable that the U.S. Conmissioner was asked by General Giles to make this approach to the Government of India as a result of seme hint dropped to him by H.M. Ambassador Istanbul and it is a pity that the application was not made earlier in order to give reasonable time for its consideration, thief After consultation with the Whitehall Departments concerned, we replied to the Government of India as in the/ ! ■the telegram flagged 'B' and have now repeated to them (flag 'C') the infoimation that the Governor of Ceylon has been asked by the Colonial Office to extend the usual courtesies to the party r but that no special attentions need, bp accorded to Prince Peter as royalty. I have since \ieard from the Foreign Office that S.ST.A.C. have now replied to the effect, that while they are prepared to receive the party they regard the whole business as an unmitigated nuisance at the present* 4^°frare* not least because Lord Motto.tbatten happens to be at General MacArthur' s Headquarters at the moment® 3 ixrodfrw d&amp;JL&amp;JrjSL In view of the further telegram from the Government of India (below) it looks as though S®E®A®C#*s wish that the party could be abandoned will be fulfilled, at, least in part, but the Foreign Office tell me that only thefcl^sident Minister yj! at Cairo will be in. a position to verify this inforaaticn 0 There is, therefore, no need for us to take any further action® 6 • o* - *- xival •/ ^7 I •it- - nni^ir*riftr 6 K/.' f t 1m- 9 ^ fi i^sqeyj 1 '■ vno EXT 3536 C.

Dear Sidebotham, With reference to our telephone conversation, I have near sent you a copy of the Government of India*s telegram about the proposed visit to India, Ceylon and Chungking by a party of l\irks and Prince Peter of Greece, at the invitation of General Giles of the U#3* Am$r. So far as the proposed visit to India is concerned, it is qtiite possible that the intention is merely to visit ‘the headquarters and various establishments of the .American India Burma Comaand in India* If this is so, it ■would not appear to be Sit£)roper for the party to travel as guests of the Americans, though ele-rly the Government of India*s agreement is required, if only because the party will need Indian visas* If, however, the j reposed visit goes outside these limits, it seems to us that the Government of India should act as host and should send a separate invitation to the Turks and to Prince peter* Tou will see from the Government of India*s telegram that the party also propose to visit Ce Ion, and here it seems clear that tiie agreement of S.E.A.C. and Government of Ceylon will have to be obtained, and that possibly one or other should issue the invitation to visit the country. No doubt you will take thio Lieutenant-Colonel C. J* C. blon^y.

I added that the Foreign Office had consulted Mr. Dening as to the views of bACSEA and that they had instructed H.M. Ambassador, Istanbul to tell the Turks that Indian visas TK&gt;uld be necessary and that the Government of India were being consulted on this. I said that our comnents would follow. I think that our further comments should be on the lines of the attached draft telegram which I have referred to the Foreign Office, Air Ministry and Ministry of Civil Aviation for their concurrence. I would be glad of your observations. If either of you think that the War Office should also be consulted I would be grateful if you would say with whom I should get into touch.there would be your guests and who could subsequently proceed to Burma as guests of British military authorities and then if they wish to China under American auspices.
