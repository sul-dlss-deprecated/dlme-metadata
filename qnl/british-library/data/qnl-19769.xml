Foreign.5-1^* Telegram p To Foreign No 1223 dated 23.12.10. Abu Musa Island. Foreign Departnent Endorsement No 2434 E.A. dated 17.11.10. In January last when I suggested settlement by corapro- -mise ,1 did so in the belief that if the suggestion were adopted the offer would be made at once as a rerdy to the German communication of December 4th, with a view to avoiding further suspension of the oxide industry; and that in case the German Government refused compromise, then only would counter evidence from our side be utilised. After this lapse of time we can hardly make the offer without conveying the premature and probably unnecessary impression that the last German rejoinder has erabarassed us and I should fear that in consequence the German Government might assume an unreasonable attitude. Therefore it would seem worth cohsiderihg whether'it Would not be better to wait a little longer until we can estimate the strength of our counter case , and if it is sufficiently good , present it simultaneously with the offer of compromise. If however the atoove apprehension is not shared by the Government of India and if they prefer to make an offer of compromise forthwith then I venture to suggest that we should preface our offer with a frank explanation that the abnormal conditions prevailing in the Gulf , namely disturbances in the Shatt-el- Arab and at Lingah, and plague at Bushire, have made it impossible for the British Representative to place himself out of telegraphic communication in order to complete examination of points raised in the German communication, and that the offer of compx-omise is now made in order to save further delay and suspension of the industry. With regard to the terms of the compromise. An offer on the lines suggested would I think meet requirements, but I would draw attention to the following points:-7^ 1 (l) The Sheikh will not be content when giving the new concession with the rent hiterto paid to him of ■£ per annum. It might be left to me to try to arrange better terms for him on a basis of a royalty on the oxide exported of so much per ton. (2) It was not our agent Abdul Latif who figured as a partner in the old concession, but his son Esa: -i-cCr however in the new concession it would be better that the father's name should appear as we should have more hold over him as a pensioner and holder of a title from Government. (?) June 1st 1910 would ordinarily have been the date of the expiry of Hassan's contract with the German firm. I would a new contract be executed in which advise that if nossible/the passages conveying a monopoly should be omitted . If this is not possible, I would suggest that the monopoly clauses in the old contract be considered , operative for a further period equal to the period of suspensior of the contract , and that after that a fresh contract , in innocuous terms , be drawn up. It is beyond my province to offer observations regard- -ing the allocation of cost between the Government of India and His Majesty's Government, but a respectfully submit for fc the consideration of the Government of India , that under i normal conditions in the Gulf the German rejoinder took 18 i Ll4 months to produce , and the fact that there some delay A in the presentation of reply to this rejoinder cannot fairly be brought into the Question. The delay has been due to cauacs beyond the control of the Government of India or their representative and which concern the interests of His Majesty's Government no less thaii the interests of the Government of India. It will be necessary for me to be absent in the Lawrence between Lingah and the Trucial Coast , out of telegraphic communication for about three weeks in order to prepare the reply to the German rejoinder for submission to Government. Lawrence has been in dock for the last four months and has not been at my. disposal, but at the end of the year she will' - whh will revert to duty with me , and subject to His Majesty's Minister's concurrence , I had arranged to proceed in her on the above duty as soon as the Admiral leaves the northern end of the Gulf. Unless 1 receive instructions to the contns- -ry I shall adhere to these plans. u Pi J l||r: ti air. |.«PP i iiiwteX (Confidential). so. / LLz E - A - BUSHIRE RESIDENCY. Reo.

Should His^a^eety's Government, however, consider it desirable to offer terms without waiting for our counter case, we support Colonel Cox's detailed proposals. We submit that question of allocation of damages, which may be awarded to Wonckhaue, should be determined not by consideration of responsibility for original interruption of contract or for the delay in preparing the counter case, but solely with reference to the interests involved. Our Agent's action was taken with a view to maintaining British political predominance in the Gulf, in which policy His majesty's Government are at least as greatly interested as the Government of lnd:;a.

In the spring you may remember that German Consulate or Hassan Samaiyeh pointed out - Iihuh 'mm that the hangars on Abu Musa Island required to be put in repair and asked that Hassan Samaiyeh might do it. I replied that the work would be done by the Shaikh of Shargah. Later on, on 28th April,in your letter No, 146 you wrote 'Hasaati Ahmed, an employe of the Chief of Shargah, arrived at Abu Musa on 22nd April 1910 and stated on seeing me, that he has been ordered by the Chief to repair the two delapidated godowns'„ I thought that the work had been carried out, but now Dr. Listemann the German Consul, complains that nothing has been done. Pleaaa let me icnow the facts, and if it is true that the repairs have not been done, send some men over from Lingah and have them put in hand at once, and let me know how it has happened that the work has not been carried out before. If you yourself take the repairs in hand as above, it will be advisable that you should write and inform the Shaikh that it had to be done urgently and that I had asked you to eet it dose Jbn his behalf.

ABU MUSA CASE. Appendix to Notes. (Major Cox's personal views.)* I-f tlie Vari0US f^ 68 of this dis P ute as ttey present themselves to my ^ op ,V p ?1 u / 0me ge i ieral ob ? er ^tions on the German communication just SSf difficult for me to enter into much detail in the short time at disposal and without reference to original documents, and persons, on the spot. The German Re joinder reads well if taken by itself, but a great deal of the argument use is answered by what has gone before on the record and is simply repetition; while the fresh evidence adduced which is mostly impugnable, does not appear to me to affect the main issues to anj serious extent. It is clear throughout their present communication that the desire of the German Govern- ment is to bring the controversy on to political ground with an ultimate appeal to the Hague if they do not get what they want from us. s This was anticipated by His Majesty's Government. In fact we appear to have arrived precisely m the position contemplated in despatch No. 40897 of 28th December 1907, from the r oreign Umce to the India Ofiice^ the paragraph commencing— 'If the German Government argue that the legality of the Shaikh's action would be a very suitable matter to refer to arbitration * etc. _I beg reference to that despatch and presume that were the dispute to be pursued on existing lines we should adopt one of the alternative courses of action adumbrated in the paragraphs following the passage above quoted, and that we should ultimately agree to erant Wonckhaus some compensation, either from Hassan Samaiyeh, or the Concessionaires as a whole, or from the Shaikh, as we might feel called upon. ., The ob ie ct of the Shaikh and ourselvesj was, not to prevent Wonckhaus from trading in Abu Musa Oxide, but to prevent his getting a monopoly and a footing on the island : and to gam this object it was foreseen that we might have to pay him compensation, and no doubt we shall, but our purpose will have been attained. It is clear that we can under no circumstances admit that Wonckhaus, on the strength of a colourable transfer effected after cancellation of the concession, has any locus standi as a partner in that concession. I venture to urge however that if we are to pursue this controversy on the lines hitherto adopted and furnish a detailed reply to the German Rejoinder^ the preparation of it. having regard to the difficulty of communication with Sargah and Lingah, must occupy many weeks if not several months, while, if the case is ultimately referred to the Hague, it will possibly be years before it is settled. Meanwhile the Oxide industry at Abu Musa would be in a state of complete suspension and the Shaikh of Shargah^s income from it in abeyance. We have clearly everything to lose while Germany has everything to gain by the protraction of the dispute. On the one hand the attitude of Shaikh Sagar and his uncle Salim will become discontented. On the other it is known that Wonckhaus can really do little or no business in the Abu Musa Oxide at present and will be much better served by paper claims for hand some damages for the loss of contract which he will claim to have been unable to fulfil. In all the circumstances does not the case admit of discussion with the German Embassy on the following lines with a view to settlement by friendly compromise ? After a re-iteration of the view that primarily the case is purely a commercial one, it would be pointed out that there has never been any desire to prevent Wonckhaus from trading in Abu Musa Oxide, and that if the settlement of the dispute is sought on the deliberate methods hitherto employed, months if not years must elapse before it is laid to rest; meanwhile discu^skm^ 1106 iQforiliation * W f II^likely be slightly amended by the time I am asked to appear for 3034 F. D. ^ Z ' C0Xy 4-2-1910.[ 2 ] the pecuniary Interests of all concerned will suffer and a chronic element of friction mil continue to exist. His Majesty's Government are most anxious to obviate this, as, no doubt, the German Government are also, and they suggest that a friendly settlement of the case might be arrived at on the following basis His Maiesty^s Government agree that whether or not Hassan Samaiyeh had the power to enter into such a transaction, and although the secretive tactics employed by the German firm naturally^ laid them under suspicion, Messrs. Wonckhaus could not be blamed for obtaining such a contract as that executed on 1st June 1906, and would be entitled to receive relief in the shape of compensation from some source, for any lond fide loss which he can prove to have suffered by the non-fulfilment of the said contract. All the parties who might conceivably be blamed, alternatively, to be liable to pay such compensation to Messrs. Wonckhaus are under British protection, and his Majesty^s Government will be prepared to recover such amounts as the German firm may prove to the satisfaction of both Governments in consulta tion, to be fairly due. With a view to the resumption of the oxide industry and to enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to engage in the trade as he may desire. His Majesty^s Govern ment are prepared to advise the Shaikh of Shargah to appoint forthwith a suitable and trustworthy Agent to undertake on his behalf (Shaikh Salim-'s interests being safeguarded) the mining and sale of the mineral: and further, they would be prepared to advise the Shaikh to direct the supply to M^essrs® Wonckhaus of such quantities of Abu Musa Oxide as he may require, up to the amounts and at the prices stipulated in the contract of 1st June 1906, and for such additional period after 1st June 1910 as will compensate for the time during which the German Firm can show that they were prevented from taking shipments by the failure of the Contractors to fulfil their obligations. After the expiry of that period Messrs. Wonekhaus would continue to be at liberty to compete with other merchants for the purchase of the mineral. The Oxide now lying at Messrs. Wonckhaus^s disposal at the mouth of the mine at present in use would naturally be expended first in satisfying his requirements. I have recorded the above suggestions in detail with much diffidence, for what they are worth; but on the subject of settlement by compromise, it may be^ of interest to note that when I was at Tehran in November, Count Quadt, the German Minister, was excessively gracious to me and showed me a good deal of hospitality. He alluded to this Abu Musa controversy, and I told him then that there never had been any desire, as my German colleague at Bushire seemed persuaded, to prevent Wonckhaus from trading in Oxide and that my own view was that it would be quite possible to settle the case by friendly compromise and hoped that that course would be attempted. He said he was surprised and glad to know that I did hold that view and much hoped that the case would be settled in that way. Count Quadt is understood not to be quite so amicably inclined in practice as he professes to be always in conversation, and the fact that the German reply is dated two months later and makes no suggestion of compromise make it probable that they will not meet us half-way, but I have thought it as well to mention the above conversation. One difficulty, which they would have in accepting our proposals, would be the fear that we might make things hot for Hassan Samaiyeh, pecuniarily or otherwise; and it might be advisable to reassure them verbally on that point. Beyond seeing that he had no further concern in any Concession, we presumably do not contemplate any particular action against him. It is even conceivable that we might be drawn to consider the possibilites of letting him participate again under suitable restrictions and supervision. P. z. COX, The 2*1111 January 1910, Phase I. Sketch of the Abu Musa Case from its commencement up to January 1910, The evenfcs and grounds which underlay the action of the Shaikh of Shargah in withdrawing the Concession. In the summer of 1906 the intention of the Hamburg-Amerika line to enter into compe tition for the carrying trade to the Persian Gulf at an early date became known.[ 3 ] 'V'l* (''' ' Brifeh ne '?M ,er with the Porte for thp Wp J r^T 7 \ i ^ that German 7 was negotiating idea of placing a coaJing^lepSt there^ W,, ^ 0f H ' 1001 ^ Pe ~ ^ '&gt;« cnrio»w°^fh^^ol t ^tf» le r itlnigltllave s&lt;&gt;,, ' i it was remaitod that Turkevpmilrlfnrt^- Ki \ n i y01 J e , amo ?^ tIienumeroUsislets of the Gulf to which the island was the coast of Kaftn- 00 0Ur f^ f ^ aim ' ^ rom f act that the mainland nearest to Governmenr^?^ any ® uch ?r T tliat su ?g ested was denied by the German Press or possibleTntrigne^in^heTud, P ^ given to the matter had the effect of nipping any SamatyerwithtL^f tlie ab . ove . incident ?ews was received of the intrigue of Hassan oamaiyeJi with the German Firm in connection with the Abu Musa Oxide Concession.

As a matter of fact, the contingency of Germany acquiring a coaling station in the Gulf and her right to do so if she wished have been frankly alluded to in the German press in 1907) dispute— {vide Berlin Embassy Despatch No. 559, dated 27th December I would emphasise the fact that there was never any desire to prevent the German firm p e Oxide at all, in competition with others. All that was objected to was the acquisition by W onckhaus of a monopoly and of rights in the mines themselves. It was with the idea of preventing these two possible contingencies that the Shaikh of pnargah on learning the state of the case decided to cancel the Concession. He was the more inclined to do this by the fact that he had already nearly lost the island on a previous occasion through the action of the Belgian Director of Persian Customs at Bushire, who had endea voured to install a flag and a Customs Post there on behalf of the Persian Government. The grounds which the Shaikh put forward in intimating to Hassan the cancellation of the lease were that the nature of the contract given to Wonckhaus^ seeing that it involved a monopoly, was such that he had no right to give it without first consulting himself (the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah) and the third partner, Esa; that the said partner did not agree, and that he himself objected to the nature of contract. Phase II. The original German Statement of claim, (Dated 3]st December 1907.) It is to be noted that before presenting their claim to us on behalf of 'Wonckhaus the German Government apparently attempted to get the Persian Government to claim severe- ignty over the Island of Abu Musa, The salient issues raised in their claim were :— Issue (^)r—That the mines were owned by Shaikh Salim personally and had been leased by him in his own right. Issue [h) ~-That the Concession had been approved by the Euling Shaikh of Shargah and that the terms of it were such that the latter had no power to cancel it. (c) —That the subsidiary Contract of 1st June 1906, for the sale of Oxide, passed by Hassan to Wonckhaus did not require the Shaikhs approval. Issue (^)—That the said Contract had the approval of the third partner, Esa. Issue (6)—That the Shaikh's illegal action had injured Wonckhaus not only as buyer of oxide, but as partner in the Mining Concession, they having purchased a share in it. In the latter capacity the German Eirm claimed compensation, not from the Concessionaires, but as one of the Concessionaires from the Shaikh of Shargah.[ 4. ] Phase III. British Reply to German Claim. (Dated 10th July 1908.) In reply to the German claim we contended Issue [a) —That the mines were not the private property of Salim^ nor had he leased them in his own right of private owner but in his capacity as Regent. Issue (i)—We agreed that the Concession of Permit was approved by the Ruling Shaikh^ but maintained that it was terminable by either side, and that Shaikh Sagar, as Ruling Shaikh of Shargah, was, in such a matter, a law unto himself, and was within his rights in putting an end to the Concession. Issue (c)—-As to the subsidiary Contract of sale given to Wonckhaus we contended that Hassan's authority did not cover the grant of such an instrument and that as the primary ground for ^Tonckhaus's claim was the failure of Hassan to fulfil his engagements the obvious remedy of the German firm was an action at law against the vendors. Issue (^)—We produced evidence to show that Esa, when he knew the whole terms of the subsidiary contract granted to Hassan (and found that it gave a monopoly), did not approve of it, and was justified in the course he took. Issue {e) —We refused to admit Wonckhaus^s locus standi as a partner in the original Concession, as he had no share in it at the time of its cancellation and the colourable acquisition of one afterwards for the purposes of this case could not be recognised. It is to be noted that in framing our reply on the above lines we did not make use of the ie monopoly ' argument as Esa and the Shaikh had. I did not understand our reason for dropping this argument at the time, but I now see that to adopt that argument was held to be inconsistent with our contemporaneous endeavour to obtain a monopoly of the Hormuz Oxide for a British Eirm. In this connection I venture to hope that the position will be reconsidered. Can the fact that the ' civilised' Government of Persia happen to deal in monopolies and that British and other foreign subjects benefit by the fact, be fairly adduced as a reason for precluding the semi-barbarous Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast from safeguard ing their interests, under the advice of the protecting power, from granting monopolies ? These ignorant Arab Shaikhs would get themselves into hopeless difficulties if not looked after in such matters. Phase IV. German Bejoinder, (Dated 3rd January 1910.) Referring to the same main issues the German Government now make rejoinder on the following lines Issue {a) —They produce evidence which they consider supports the contention that Salim granted the original Concession in his own absolute right as formal owner, not only of the mines and other property in the island, but of the island itself. As an alternative they claim that even if it be possible to doubt Salim's formal ownership of the Island, he is proved to have exercised the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner, both with and against the consent of the Ruling Shaikh. Issue (5)—That the original Concession was approved by the Ruling Shaikh we have always conceded. What we contend is that he was justified in cancelling it. The German reply presses the argument that the Ruling Shaikh (or the owner of the Island, whoever he may be) had no power either according to the terms of the lease, or according to religious or commercial law, to revoke the mining rights of the concessionaires: that they were in fact irrevocable. From the administrative point of view they contend that the Shaikh's action had no justification. Issue (c)—As regards the subsidiary contract they argue that there is no valid reason for any action at law by Wonckhaus against the vendors, for no action of theirs has been harmful to Messrs. Wonckhaus; it is simply Shaikh Sagar^s action which has injured them. They claim that the Memorandum of association drawn up gave Hassan full authority for all he did.t s ] I ''' to mma circLSS. U,a ' ■' '« » P«e of defensive tactic, jueUfic/by tto Jwe (/)—They introduce the fresh and interesting contention that the Shaikh of Linsrah 'n ,^ 0 J^ n s(liction over the Concessionaires inter se, as they reside in Consulate-General and ii intht of . *:'? ****** 0n Mtfitm, of fresh in except' on S , re ^ der can be ^ly dealt with in detail. following preliminary general observations ire oSXi- ^ ^ reference ' but the 0f evidence - Educed to prove Salim's private {i) The exercise by Salim of the right to jetsam and flotsam.

This may equallv well have been rejected because Salim found that he could not make 3 such pretensions and thought it better to modify them. g [Hi, Receipt of revenue from Mother-of-pearl and 'canary-seed.' (Canary-seed ' ' A a + mistran S lation of some unfamiliar Arabic word, probably Zinni, the giant Oyster, as distinct from the ordinary pearl-oyster.) By the same analogy as that drawn in the case of jetsam and flotsam-ae this payment was an item of Revenue from the island which Salim enjoyed under his understanding with his nephew, it was quite in order that in his commercial capacity as a member of the Mining Concession, Sagar should share the payment made by his partners to Salim on this or any other account which could be^ regarded as income of the island. Thus Salim does not exercise the right to usufruct adversely to the Ruling Shaikh, but adversely t o Sagar^ a member of the Mining Concession. (iv) Lease'by Salim of ' Mica 'deposits on 26th December 1898. 'Mica' should Land There is no marketable Mica, if any at all, on the This again is compatible with the position that Sagar relinquished to Salim any income derivable from the island but is the most inconvenient piece of evidence which they have produced. The fact probably is that the Ruling Shaikh would probably give Sahm a free hand so long as the latter's management of the island did not prejudice his sovereign rights or obligations to the British Government. The alternative German claim that even if Salinas formal ownership be doubted his practical enjoyment of the usufruct is proved will I think have to be conceded in fact has been conceded, but with the reservation that such enjoyment is with the consent and permission of the Kuling Shaikh. The instance they quote as tending to prove that Salim exercised the privilege adversely to the Kulino: Shaikh is not in point. The personal relation of the one Shaikh to the other must be remembered. Salim must be 30 years older than his nephew Shaikh Sagar, and was himself Ruling Shaikh for 18 years. The swing of the tribal pendulum placed the yountr nephew in the Shaikhship. He is naturally in a very delicate position towards his aged relative and predecessor, and as long as the latter remains loyal and inoffensive, he is ^content ^to let him enjoy any income, so long as it remains inconsiderable as it has hitherto, from Abu Musa. The moment the income becomes in his opinion unreasonably great for Shaikh Salim, or Salim becomes troublesome, he is in a position to alter the arrangement arbitrarily in any way he pleases, short of oppression, in which case we should give Salim our friendly offices in obtaining reasonable consideration. The most obvious evidence of the character of Salinas tenure or tenancy of the island are: Firstly; the fact that if he were private owner of the island or mines in his 3034 F. D[ ft 1 own right he must have acquired them from somewhere and would have the ordinary deeds in support o^^^t^ know or think that he has, why discovery of ^-^^ahm owned in his own right he could will the property away but I am sure he wo not claim to do so, nor would his nephew tolerate such a claim for a mom n . The Bahrein Principality recently furnished a case which bears on this ques ion.. Shaikh Ali, nephew of the Ruling Shaikh, was deported in 1904 ^ unruly con net. He was at the time in the enjoyment of certam State property^ Un hus deportation the Ruling Shaikh resumed the pr o perty, and the ne ^T return could not claim it back, he was simply dependent on his uncle s kind consideration. These petty potentates have to e ^XLToyally most convenient way of doing so is to give them, as long, as. they behave loyally, the enjoyment of state property. Secondly; our action in rescuing Abu Musa from Persian an f taken long before this dispute was ever dreamed of. It was taken at the instance of the Ruling Shaikh, not of Shaikh Salim. Salim made no attemp to pose to us as owner of the island, ^ ImeW _We do not dispute the fact that the Ruling Shaikh approved the ^ Concession. In support of their contention that the latter had no power to revoke the rights^ of the ^ «Mining Company' certain recorded opinions are now adduced and it is V argued that the Concession is unterminable by the grantor either by religious or commercial law- They also contend as before that Shaikh Sagar s action if viewed from the administrative standpoint was unjustmablei Evidence such as that produced by them can be bought to, any extent Brown and Doctor Listemann have simply gone out getting hold of certain ' leading, merchants' and others who,.as far as I recognise their identity, are known to have specific animus against us or our Agent at Lmgah. The arguments brought forward under the head of this Issue^seem all based on the idea that our object was to stop Wonckhaus trading m Oxide altogether, which was not the case. j ssue I q)—The Memorandum of Association gave Hassan the authority to conduct sales but not to grant monopolies which was contray to the Shaikh sown, principles j much less to alienate: to a foreigner or any one else, a share in the ^ Concession itself. J ssu e Id) —They produce no fresh element. We are- agreed that Esa knew of the sales to the Germans. 'What he objected to was the grant of the monopoly which he did not know of, and subsequently^ to the sale of a share in the- Company to Brown. j s . m e (el—The transfer of the share to Brown, and by Brown to Wbnckhaus is simply instified as an act of legitimate self defence ; and, on the assumption that the- cancellation was void and illegal^ it is argued that the transfer was m time and in order. Jssue if) —This issue is adroitly raised in order, if possible^ to withdraw the dispute^from the sphere of the Residency of the Government of India to that of the Legation at Tehran.- Of course we are in-a much stronger position to lay down what tha Shaikh of Shargah can or cannot do as long as we deal with the matter was within the jurisdiction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. Abu Musa having nothing to do with Persia and the Shaikh / pf Shargah being under the jurisdiction of the Govern- ment of India and not of His Majesty's Legation, the argument can no doubt; t be easily resisted and should be;. g, G.

He was the more inclined to do this by the fact that he had already nearly lost the island on a previous occasion through the action of the Belgian Director of Persian Customs at Bushire, who had endea voured to install a nag and a Customs Post there on behalf of the Persian Government. The grounds which the Shaikh put forward in intimating to Hassan the cancellation of the lease were that the nature of the contract given to Wonckhaus^ seeing that it involved a monopoly, was such that he had no right to give it without first consulting himself (the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah) and the third partner, Esa; that the said partner did not agree and that he himself objected to the nature of contract. Phase II. Tke original German Statement of claim. (Dated 31st December 1907.) It is to be noted that before presenting their claim to us on behalf of Wonckhaus the German Government apparently attempted to get the Persian Government to claim sovere- ignty over the Island of Abu Musa. The salient issues raised in their claim were :— Issue [a) —That the mines were owned by Shaikh Salim personally and had been leased by him in his own right. Issue {i) ^-That the Concession had been approved by the Euling Shaikh of Shargah and that the terms of it were such that the latter had no power to cancel it. Issue (^)—-That the subsidiary Contract of 1st June 1906, for the sale of Oxide &gt; passed by Hassan to Wonckhaus did not require the Shaikhs approval. Issue (^)—That the said Contract had the approval of the third partner, Esa. Issue [e) —That the Shaikh's illegal action had injured Wonckhaus not only as buyer of oxide, but as partner in the Mining Concession, they having purchased a share in it. In the latter capacity the German Eirm claimed compensation, not from the Concessionaires, but as one of the Concessionaires from the Shaikh of Shargah.[ 4 ] Phasb III. British Reply to (Dated lOtli July 1908.) In reply to the Gorman claim we contended Issue (a)—That the mines were not the private property of Salim, nor had he leased them in his own. right of private owner but in his capacity as Regent. Ume (b) —We agreed that the Concession of Permit was approved by the Ruling Shaikh; but 'maintained that it was terminable by either side, and that Shaikh Sagar, as Ruling Shaikh of Shargah, was, in such a matter, a law unto himself, and was within his rights in putting an end to the Concession. Issue (c)^-As to the Subsidiary Contract of sal6 given to Wonckhaus we contended that Hassan's authority did not cover the grant of such an instrument and that as the primary ground for W^onckhaus's claim was the failure of Hassan to fulfil his engagements the obvious remedy of the German firm was an action at law against the vendors. Issue (d)~We produced evidence to «how that Esa, when h§ knew the whole teiifts of the subsidiary contract granted to Hassan (and found that it gave^tfiOnopOly), did not approve of it, and was justified in the course he took. Issue (e) —We refused to admit Wonckhans's locus standi as a partner in the Original Concession, as he had no share in it at the time of its cancellation and tho colourable acquisition of one afterwards for the purposes of this case could not be recognised. It is to be noted that in framing our reply on the above lines we did not make use of the &lt;c monopoly ' argument as Esa and the Shaikh had. I did not .understand our reason for dropping this argument at the time, but I now see that to adopt that argument was held to be inconsistent with our -contemporaneous endeavour to obtain a monopoly of the Hornruz Oxide for a British Firm. In this connection I venture to hope that the position will be reconsidered. Can the fact that the ' civilised' Government of Persia happen to deal in monopolies and that British and other foreign subjects benefit by the fact, be fairly adduced as a reason for precluding the semi-barbarous Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast from safeguard ing their interests, under the advice of the protecting power, from granting monopolies ? These ignorant Arab Shaikhs would get themselves into hopeless difficulties if not looked after in such matters. Phase IV. German Rejoinder, (Dated 3rd January 1910.) Referring to the same main issues the German Government now make rejoinder on the following lines :— Issue [a) —They produce evidence which they consider supports the contention that Salim granted the original Concession in Ms own absolute right as formal owner, not only of the mines and other property in the island, but of the island itself. As an alternative they claim that even if it be possible to doubt Salim's formal ownership of the Island, he is proved to have exercised the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner, both with and against the ^consent of the Ruling Shaikh. Issue [h) —That the original Concession was approved l)y the Ruling Shaikh we have always conceded. What we contend is that he 'was justified in cancelling it. The German reply presses the argument that ttie Ruling Shaikh (or the owner of the Island, whoever he may be) had no power either according to the terms of the lease, or according to religious or comtmercial law, to revoke the mining rights of the concessionaires: that they were in fact irrevocable. From the administrative point of view they contend that the Shaikh's action had no justification. Issue (e)—As regards the subsidiary contract they argue that there is no valid reason for any action at law by Wonckhaus against the vendors, for no action of theirs has been harmful to Messrs. Wonckhaus j it is simply Shaikh Sagar^s action which has injured them. They claim that the Memorandum of association drawn up gave Hassan full authority for all he did. J[ 6 1 ^ at 0 ' ' lte partner IttMt («)—A&lt; to the colourable tmiuter of « share in the original concession W B.... to Brom, and Bro^ to Wonekhane and Com^y Zy^TX ST cir JmsSJs. C it was a piece of defensive tactics justified by t^ Isme (/)—They introduce the fresh and interesting contention that the Shaikh of Shargah has no jurisdiction over the Concessionaires as they reside in ?Cf\r ^ jurisdiction of the British Consulate-General and not in that of the Kesident m the Persian Gulf. Brief comment on chief items of fresh evidence in German Rejoinder. It is impossible that the German rejoinder can be fully dealt with in detail* except on the spot and with vernacular documents at hand for reference, but the following preliminary general observations are offered Issue [a) Certain new items of evidence are adduced to prove Salim's private ownership of the island. (i) The exercise by Salim of t\e right to jetsam and flotsam. These Arab Shaikhs have no^ clear ideas on such subjects and the exercise of this right by Salim is quite compatible with an arrangement or understanding between uncle and nephew under which Sagar allows Salim to enjoy what income there may be from the Island. We have not stated anything to the contrary, and this position is compatible with what is stated in my note on the history of Abu Musa (Appendix 6 of our Case). {ii) The first and rejected draft, dated 6th April 1898, of the Oxide Concession, in which Salim uses expressions suggesting formal ownership. This may equally well have been rejected because Salim found that he could not make good such pretensions and thought it better to modify them. (w; Receipt of revenue from Mother-of-pearl and 'canary-seed.'' (Canary-seed must I think be a mistranslation of some unfamiliar Arabic word, probably ' Zinni/' the giant Oyster, as distinct from the ordinary pearl-oyster.) By the same analogy as that drawn in the case of Jetsam and flotsam—as this payment was an item of Revenue from the island which Salim enjoyed under his understanding with his nephew, it was quite in order that in his commercial capacity as a member of the Mining Concession, Sagar should share the payment made by his partners to Salim on this or any other account which could be regarded as income of the island. Thus Salim does not exercise the right to usufruct adversely to the Ruling Shaikh, but adversely to Sagar, a member of the Mining Concession. (iv) Lease by Salim of ' Mica deposits on 26th December 1898. ' Mica J ' should I think read ' Gypsum.'' There is no marketable Mica, if any at all, on the island. This again is compatible with the position that Sagar relinquished to Salim any income derivable from the island but is the most inconvenient piece of evidence which they have produced. The fact probably is that the Ruling Shaikh would probably give Salim a free hand so long as the latter^ management of the island did not prejudice his sovereign rights or obligations to the British Government. The alternative German claim that even if Salinas formal ownership be doubted his practical enjoyment of the usufruct is proved will I think have to be conceded, in fact has been conceded, but with the reservation that such enjoyment is with the consent and permission of the Ruling Shaikh. The instance they quote as tending to prove that Salim exercised the privilege adversely to the Ruling Shaikh is not in point. The personal relation of the one Shaikh to the other must be remembered. Salim must be SO years older than his nephew Shaikh Sagar, and was himself Ruling Shaikh for 18 years. The swing of the tribal pendulum placed the young nephew in the Shaikhship. He is naturally in a very delicate position towards his aged relative and predecessor, and as long as the latter remains loyal and inoffensive, he is content to let him enjoy any income, so long as it remains inconsiderable as it has hitherto, from Abu Musa. The moment the income becomes in his opinion unreasonably great for Shaikh Salim, or Salim becomes troublesome, he is in a position to alter the arrangement arbitrarily in any way he pleases, short of oppression, in which case we should give Salim our friendly offices in obtaining reasonable consideration. The most obvious evidence of the character of Salinas tenure or tenancy of the island are: Firstly; the fact that if he were private owner of the island or mines in his m4F. D»[ 6 ] own right lie must have acquired them from somewhere and would have the ordinary deeds in support of his title. But he says he basnothmgofthe sort and maL no such claim. If the Germans know or think that he has, why do they not allude to such or ask for discovery of them. Again if Salim owned in his own right he could will the property away but I am sure he would not claim to do so, nor would his nephew tolerate such a claim for a moment. The Bahrein Principality recently furnished a ease which bears on this question. Shaikh Ali, nephew of the Ruling Shaikh, was deported in 1904 for unruly ^duct. He was at the time in the enjoyment of certain State property. On his deportation the B ,uling Shaikh resumed the property, and the nephew on his return could not claim it back, he was simply dependent on his uncle s kind consideration. These petty potentates have to support their relations and the most convenient way of doing so is to give them, as long as they behave loyally, the enjoyment of state property. Secondly; our action in rescuing Abu Musa from Persian annexation in 1904 was taken long before this dispute was ever dreamed of. It was taken at the instance of the Ruling Shaikh, not of Shaikh Salim. Salim made no attempt to pose to us as owner of the island. j sme (£)_We do not dispute the fact that the Ruling Shaikh approved the Concession. In support of their contention that the latter had no power to revoke the rights, of the- ' Mining Company 93 certain recorded opinions are now adduced and^ it is. argued that the Concession is unterminable by tha grantor either by religious or commercial law. They also contend as before that _ Shaikh Sagar s action if viewed from the administrative standpoint was unjustifiable. Evidence such as that produced by them can be bought to any extent. Brown and Doctor Listemann have simply gone out getting hold of certain leading, merchants' and others who, as far as I recognise their identity, are known to have specific animus against us or our Agent at Lingah. The arguments brought forward under the head of this Issue seem all based on the idea that our object was to stop Wonckhaus trading in Oxide altogether, which was not the case. j ssue —The Memorandum of Association gave Hassan the authority to conduct sales, but not to grant monopolies which was contray to the Shaikh's own principles ; much less to alienate to a foreigner or any one else, a share in the. Concession itself. Issue (J)—They produce no fresh element. We are agreed that Esa knew of the sales to the Germans. What he objected to was the grant of the monopoly which he did not know of, and subsequently, to the sale of a share in the^ Company to Brown. Issue (&lt;?)—The transfer of the share to Brown, and by Brown to Wonckhaus is simply justified as an act of legitimate self defence ; and, on the assumption that the- cancellation was void and illegal, it is argued that the transfer was in time and in order. Issue [f) —This issue is adroitly raised in order, if possible, to withdraw the dispute from the sphere of the Residency of the Government of India to that of the Legation at Tehran. Of course we are in a much stronger position to lay down what the Shaikh of Shargah can or cannot do as long as we deal with the matter was within the jurisdiction, of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. Abu Musa having nothing to do with Persia and the Shaikh of Shargah being under the jurisdiction of the Govern ment of India and not of His Majesty's Legation, the argument can no doubt be easily resisted and should be. S. G. P. I.— 3034 F. D. 2-3.10.—If.FOREIGN DEPARTMENT NOTES. ABU MUSA CASE. Appendix to Notes- (Major Cox's personal views.)* • / a PP e . n ^ a su _ i n mar y of the various stages of this dispute as thej present themselves to my mmd, and have added to it some general observations on the German communication iust received. It is difficult for me to enter into much detail in the short time at disposal and without reference to original documents, and persons, on the spot. The German Rejoinder reads well if taken by itself, but a great deal of the argument used is answered by what has gone before on the record and is simply repetition} while the fresh evidence adduced, which is mostly impugnable, does not appear to me to affect the main issues to any serious extent. It is clear throughout their present communieation that the desire of the German Govern ment is to bring the controversy on to political ground with an ultimate appeal to the Hague if they do not get what they want from us. This was anticipated hj His Majesty^s Government. In fact we appear to have arrived precisely in the position contemplated in despatch No. 40897 of 28th December 1907, from the Foreign Office to the India Office; the paragraph commencing-— ' If the German Government argue that the legality of the Shaikh's action would be a very suitable matter to refer to arbitration * * ' etc. I beg^ reference to that despatch and presume that were the dispute to be pursued on existing lines we should adopt one of the alternative courses of action adumbrated in the paragraphs following the passage above quoted, and that we should ultimately agree to grant Wonckhaus some compensation, either from Hassan Samaiyeh, or the Concessionaires as a whole, or from the Shaikh, as we might feel called upon. The object of the Shaikh and ourselvesj was, not to prevent Wonckhaus from trading in Abu Musa Oxide, but to prevent his getting a monopoly and a footing on the island ; and to gain this object it was foreseen that we might have to pay him compensation, and no doubt we shall, but our purpose will have been attained. It is clear that we can under no circumstances admit that Wonckhaus, on the strength of a colourable transfer effected after cancellation of the concession, has any locus standi as a partner in that concession. I venture to urge however that if we are to pursue this controversy on the lines hitherto adopted and furnish a detailed reply to the German Eejoinder, the preparation of it, having regard to the difficulty of communication with Sargah and Lingah, must occupy many weeks if not several months, while, if the case is ultimately referred to the Hague, it will possibly be years before it is settled. Meanwhile the Oxide industry at Abu Musa would be in a state of complete suspension and the Shaikh of Shargah's income from it in abeyance. We have clearly everything to lose while Germany has everything to gain by the 'protraction of the dispute. On the one hand the attitude of Shaikh Sagar and his uncle Salim will become discontented. On the other it is known that Wonckhaus can really do little or no business in the Abu Musa Oxide at present and will be much better served by paper claims for hand some damages for the loss of contract which he will claim to have been unable to fulfil. In all the circumstances does not the case admit of discussion with the German Embassy on the following lines with a view to settlement by friendly compromise ? After a re-iteration of the view that primarily the case is purely a commercial one, it would be pointed out that there has never been any desire to prevent Wonckhaus from trading in Abu Musa Oxide, and that if the settlement of the dispute is sought on the deliberate methods hitherto employed, months if not years must elapse before it is laid to rest; meanwhile * Advance draft for information. Well may likely be slightly amended by the time I am asked to appear for discussion. P. Z. Cox,-4-2-1910. 3034 F. D.[ 2 ] the peeuniary interests of all concerned will suffer and a chronic element of friction will continue to exist. His Majesty's Government are most anxious to obviate this, as, no doubt, the German Government are also, and they suggest that a friendly settlement of the case might be arrived at on the following basis His Maiesty's Government agree that whether or not Hassan Samaiyeh had the power to enter into such a transaction, and although the secretive tactics employed by the German firm naturally laid them under suspicion, Messrs. 'Wonckhaus could not be blamed for obtaining such a contract as that executed on 1st June 1906, and would be entitled to receive relief in the shape of compensation from some source, for any loud fide loss which he can prove to have suffered by the non-fulfilment of the said contract. All the parties who might conceivably be blamed, alternatively, to be liable to pay such compensation to Messrs. Wonckhaus are under British protection, and his Majesty's Government will be prepared to recover such amounts as the German firm may prove to the satisfaction of both Governments in consulta tion, to be fairly due. With a view to the resumption of the oxide industry and to enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to engage in the trade as he may desire. His Majesty's Govern ment are prepared to advise the Shaikh of Shargah to appoint forthwith a suitable and trustworthy Agent to undertake on his behalf (Shaikh Salim's interests being safeguarded) the mining and sale of the mineral: and further, they would be prepared to advise the Shaikh to direct the supply to Messrs,, Wonckhaus of such quantities of Abu Musa Oxide as he may require, up to the amounts and at the prices stipulated in the contract of 1st June 1906, and for such additional period after 1st June 1910 as will compensate for the time during which the German Firm can show that they were prevented from taking shipments by the failure of the Contractors to fulfil their obligations. After the expiry of that period Messrs. Wonckhaus would continue to be at liberty to compete with other merchants for the purchase of the mineral. The Oxide now lying at Messrs. Wonckhaus's disposal at the mouth of the mine at present in use would naturally be expended first in satisfying his requirements, I have recorded the above suggestions in detail with much diffidence, for what they are worth; but on the subject of settlement by compromise, it may be of interest to note that when I was at Tehran in November, Count Quadt, the German Minister, was excessively gracious to me and showed me a good deal of hospitality. He alluded to this Abu Musa controversy, and I told him then that there never had been any desire, as my German colleague at Bushire seemed persuaded, to prevent Wonckhaus from trading in Oxide and that my own view was that it would be quite possible to settle the case by friendly compromise and hoped that that course would be attempted. He said he was surprised and glad to know that I did hold that view and much hoped that the case would be settled in that way. Count Quadt is understood not to be quite so amicably inclined in practice as he professes to be always in conversation, and the fact that the German reply is dated two months later and makes no suggestion of compromise make it probable that they will not meet us half-way, but I have thought it as well to mention the above conversation. One difficulty, which they would have in accepting our proposals, would be the fear that we might make things hot for Hassan Samaiyeh, pecuniarily or otherwise; and it might be advisable to reassure them verbally on that point. Beyond seeing that he had no further concern in any Concession, we presumably do not contemplate any particular action against him. It is even conceivable that we might be drawn to consider the possibilites of letting him participate again under suitable restrictions and supervision. P. Z. COX. The 2^1 th January 1910. Phase I. Sketch of the A6u Musa Case from its commencement up to January 1910, The events and grounds whicli underlay the action of the Shaikh of Shargah in withdrawing the Concession.

T o co ™^ um&lt; r atln g the facts as far as they were then known to the Government of India x expressed the view that the grant of a monopoly without limit of time gave the Shaikh of argah reasonable grounds for withdrawing the Concession, and that although the Abu nro f + +1. 6 mi f? n , prove to be of great commercial value it was politically important to mfght prove 0 !^ 11 German y of vested interests in the Gulf, such as this oxide monopoly J' 1 ® Government of India were of the same opinion and apart from the commercial aspect of the question took count of the fact that where Oxide could be conveniently stored and snipped, there coal could be handled with equal facility. As a, matter of fact, the contingency of Germany acquiring a coaling station in the Gulf and her right to do so if she wished have been frankly alluded to in the German press in 1907) n dispute— {vide Berlin Embassy Despatch No. 559, dated 27th December . J would emphasise the fact that there was never any desire to prevent the German firm getting Oxide at all, in competition with others. All that was objected to was the acquisition by Wonckhaus of a monopoly and of rights in the mines themselves. It was with the idea of preventing these two possible contingencies that the Shaikh of pnargah on learning the state of the case decided to cancel the Concession.. He was the more melmed to do this by the fact that he had already nearly lost the island on a previous occasion through the action of the Belgian Director of Persian Customs at Bushire, who had endea voured to install a flag and a Customs Post there on behalf of the Persian Government. The grounds which the Shaikh put forward in intimating to Hassan tha cancellation of the lease were that the nature of the contract given to Wonckhaus, seeing that it involved a monopoly, was such that he had no right to give it without first consulting himself (the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah) and the third partner, Esa; that the said partner did not agree, and that he himself objected to the nature of contract. Phase II. The original German Statement of claim, (Dated 31st December 1907.) It is to be noted that before presenting their claim to us on behalf of Wonckhaus the German Government apparently attempted to get the Persian Government to claim sovere ignty over the Island of Abu Musa. The salient issues raised in their claim were Issue (^)—That the mines were owned by Shaikh Salim personally and had been leased by him in his own right. Issue [h) ^-That the Concession had been approved by the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah and that the terms of it were such that the latter had no power to cancel it. (c) —That the subsidiary Contract of 1st June 1906, for the sale of Oxide, passed by Hassan to Wonckhaus did not require the Shaikh^s approval. Issue (^)—That the said Contract had the approval of the third partner, Esa. Issue (€)—-That the Shaikh's illegal action had injured Wonckhaus not only as buyer of oxide, but as partner in the Mining Concession, they having purchased a share in it. In the latter capacity the German Eirm claimed compensation, not from the Concessionaires, but as one of the Concessionaires from the Shaikh of Shargah.,r [ 4 ] Phase III. British Reply to German Claim. (Dated 10th July 1908.) In reply to the German claim we contended Issue (a) —That the mines were not the private property of Salim, nor had he leased them in his own right of private owner but in his capacity as Regent. Issue {h) —We agreed that the Concession of Permit was approved by the Ruling Shaikh^ but maintained that it was terminable by either side, and that Shaikh Sagar, as Ruling Shaikh of Shargah, was ; in such a matter, a law uiito himself, and was within his rights in putting an end to the Concession. Issue (c)—As to the subsidiary Contract of sale given to Wonckhaus we contended that Hassan^s authority did not cover the grant of such an instrument and that as the primary ground for Wonckhaus^s claim was the failure of Hassan to fulfil his engagements the obvious remedy of .the German firm was an action at law against the vendors. Issue (d) —We produced evidence to show that Esa, ;when he knew the whole terms of the subsidiary contract granted to Hassan (and found that it gave a monopoly), did not approve of it, and was justified in the course he took. Issue (tf)—We refused to admit Wonckhaus^s locus standi as a partner in the original Concession, as he had no share in it at the time of its icancellation and the colourable acquisition of one afterwards for the purposes of this case could not be recognised. It is to be noted that in framing our reply on the above lines we did not make use of the monopoly ' argument as Esa and the Shaikh had. I did not understand our reason for dropping this argument at the time, but I now see that to adopt that argument was held to be inconsistent with our contemporaneous endeavour to obtain a monopoly of the Hormuz Oxide for a British Firm. In this connection I venture to hope that the position will be reconsidered. Can the fact that the ' civilised' Government of Persia happen to deal in monopolies and that British and other foreign subjects benefit by the fact, be fairly adduced as a reason for precluding the semi-barbarous Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast from safeguard ing their interests, under the advice of the protecting power, from granting monopolies ? These ignorant Arab Shaikhs would get themselves into hopeless difficulties if not looked after in such matters. Phase IV. German Rejoinder. (Dated 3rd January 1910.) Referring to the same main issues the German Government now make rejoinder on the following lines • Issue [a) —-They produce evidence which they consider supports the contention that Salim granted the original Concession in his own absolute right as formal owner, not only of the mines and other property in the island, but of the island itself. As an alternative they claim that even if it be possible to doubt Salim's formal ownership of the Island, he is proved to have exercised the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner, both with and against the consent of the Ruling Shaikh. Issue 5) That the original Concession was approved by the Ruling Shaikh we have always conceded. What we contend is that he was justified in cancelling it. The German reply presses the argument that .the Ruling Shaikh (or the owner of the Island, whoever he may be) had no power either according to the terms of the lease, or according to religious or commercial law, to revoke the mmmg rights of the concessionaires: that they were in fact irrevocable. Jbrom the administrative point of view they contend that the Shaikh's action had no justification. hsue W—As regards the subsidiary contract they argue that there is no valid reason for any Action at law by Wonckhan, agaiart tie vendors, for no ac&amp;Trf action wJLlSS ' i8 SWd.

These Arab Shaikhs have no clear ideas on such subjects and the exercise of this nght by balim is quite compatible with an arrangement or understanding between uncle and nephew under which Sagar allows Salim to enioy what income there may be from the Island. We have not stated anything to the contrary, and this position is compatible with what is stated in my note on the history of Abu Musa (Appendix 6 of our Case). ( m ') The first and rejected draft, dated 6th April 1898, of the Oxide Concession, in which oalim uses expressions suggesting formal ownership. This may equally well have been rejected because Salim found that he could not make good such pretensions and thought it better to modify them. {in, Receipt of revenue from Mother-of-pearl and 'canary-seed/' (Canary-seed niust I think bo a mistranslation of somo unfamiliar Arabic word ; probably ' Zinni^ the giant Oyster^ as distinct from the ordinary pearl-oyster.) By the same analogy as that drawn in the case of jetsam and flotsam—as this payment was an item of Revenue from the island which Salim enjoyed under his understanding with his nephew, it was quite in order that in his commercial capacity as a member of the Mining Concession, Sagar should share the payment made by his partners to Salim on this or any other account which could be regarded as income of the island. Thus Salim does not exercise the right to usufruct adversely to the Ruling Shaikh, but adversely to Sagar ; a member of the Mining Concession. (iv) Lease by Salim of ' Mica ' deposits on 26th December 1898. ' Mica ' should I think read ' Gypsum.'' There is no marketable Mica, if any at all, on the island. This again is compatible with the position that Sagar relinquished to Salim any income derivable from the island but is the most inconvenient piece of evidence which they have produced. The fact probably is that the Ruling Shaikh would probably give Salim a free hand so long as the latter's management of the island did not prejudice his sovereign rights or obligations to the British Government. The alternative German claim that even if Salinas formal ownership be doubted his practical enjoyment of the usufruct is proved will I think have to be conceded, in fact has been conceded, but with the reservation that such enjoyment is with the consent and permission of the Ruling Shaikh. The instance they quote as tending to prove that Salim exercised the privilege adversely to the Ruling Shaikh is not in point. The personal relation of the one Shaikh to the other must be remembered. Salim must be 30 years older than his nephew Shaikh Sagar, and was himself Ruling Shaikh for 18 years. The swing of the tribal pendulum placed the young nephew in the Shaikhship. He is naturally in a very delicate position towards his aged relative and predecessor, and as long as the latter remains loyal and inoffensive, he is content to let him enjoy any income, so long as it remains inconsiderable as it has hitherto, from Abu Musa. The moment the income becomes in his opinion unreasonably great for Shaikh Salim, or Salim becomes troublesome, he is in a position to alter the arrangement arbitrarily in any way he pleases, short of oppression, in which case we should give Salim our friendly offices in obtaining reasonable consideration. The most obvious evidence of the character of Salim's tenure or tenancy of the island are : Firstly j the fact that if he were private owner of the island or mines in his 3034. F. D.[ ^ ] own right lie must have acquired them from somewhere and would have the^ ordinary deeds in support of his title. But he says he has nothing of the sort and makes no such claim. If the Germans know or think that he has, why do they not allude to such or ask for discovery of them. Again if Salim owned in his own right he could will the property away but I am sure he would not claim to do so, nor would his nephew tolerate such a claim for a moment. The Bahrein Principality recently furnished a case which bears on this question» Shaikh Ali, nephew of the Ruling Shaikh, was deported in 1&amp;04 for unruly conduct. He was at the time in the enjoyment of certain State property. On his deportation the Ruling Shaikh resumed the property, and the nephew on his return could not claim it back, he was simply dependent on his uncle^s kind consideration. These petty potentates, have to support their relations and the most convenient way of doing so is to give them, as long as they behave loyally, the enjoyment of state property. Secondly; our action in rescuing Abu Musa from Persian annexation in 1904 was taken long before this dispute was ever dreamed of. It was taken at the instance of the Ruling Shaikh, not of Shaikh Salim. Salim made no attempt to pose to us as owner of the island. Issue {b) —We do not dispute the fact that the Ruling Shaikh approved the Concession. In support of their contention that the latter had no power to revoke the rights of the- 'Mining Company ^ certain recorded opinions are now adduced and it is argued that the Concession is unterminable by the grantor either by religious or commercial law. They also contend as before that Shaikh Sagar's action if viewed from the administrative standpoint was unjustifiable. Evidence such as that produced by them can be bought to any extent. Brown and Doctor Listemann have simply gone out getting hold of certain ' leading merchants.' and others who, as far as I recognise their identity, are known to have specific animus against us or our Agent at Lingah. The arguments brought forward under the head of this Issue seem all based on the idea that our object was to stop Wonckhaus trading in Oxide altogether, which was not the case. Issue [c) —The Memorandum of Association gave Hassan the authority to conduct sales, but not to grant monopolies which was contray to the Shaikh's owm principles ; much less to alienate to a foreigner or any one else, a share in the Concession itself. Issue {d) —They produce no fresh element. We are agreed that Esa knew of the- sales to the Germans. What he objected to was the grant of the monopoly which he did not know of, and subsequently,, to the sale of a share in the Company to Brown. Issue (*?)—The transfer of the share to Brown, and by Brown to Wonckhaus is simply justified jis an act of legitimate self defence; and, on the assumption that the cancellation was void and illegal, it is argued that the transfer was in time and in order. Issue (/)—This issue is adroitly raised in order, if possible, to withdraw the dispute from the sphere of the Residency of the Government of India to that of the Legation at Tehran. Of course we are in a much stronger position, to lay down what the Shaikh of Shargah. can or cannot do as long as we deal with the matter was within the jurisdiction, of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. Abu Musa having nothing to do with Persia and the Shaikh of Shargah being under the jurisdiction of the 1 Govern ment of India and not of His Majesty's Legation, the argument can no doubt be easily resisted and should, be;. 4 S. a P.

Foreign Department telegram No S 101. At the time that the above mentioned telegram arrived the Cierman Vice Consul was absent from Bushire on a few days shooting trip. He returned about the 23rd. I have waited in order to deliver the message personally. Aga Badr telegraphed to me this morning stating that he had been informed by Hassan Bamaih that Wonckhaus wish to send coolies within four days to get oxide ready for the steamer Naseri on her return journey, the steamer is at present at Basrah. On receiving this telegram I called on the German Consul and communicated to him the message from H.M's Govt as indicated in your telegram 101. In reply he said he wished to have the matter communicated officially as time would be necessary for him to frame his reply. I then told him that I had heard that the Naseri was going to take a shioment of oxide and asked him whether he was going to send me a notification . In reply he said he knew nothing of Wonckhaus's intention. I told him that I could not agree to Messrs Wonckhaus sending their own men and that theold procedure ought to continue,viz; that Hassan should make a all arrangements. With a view to arriving at an arrangemeibt satisfactory to both parties a long discussion followed but no result was arrived at. I elicited the following facts in the course of the discussion , first , that this shipment is one of those to India which Hassan is allowed 2ndly, that Messrs W intend to send the workmen in charge of Hassan's brother Hamid. Wassmuss could only make the ^ suggestion that * Wonckhaus should send coolies in the name of Hassan' I said that I thought we should raise no objection if Hassan accepted the conditions and sent coolies in his contract with W and no + +Vi ' a i =&gt; + + ■='■' '+ oilcoolies in charge of Hamid . These being the circumstance I have replied to the following effect to Aga Badr:- He should inform Hassan that I cannot agree to coolies being sent by Messrs Wonckhaus for the following reasons 1st. Government sees no reason why fhe procedure followed hitherto i.e. that Hassan himself should arrange shipments under the necessary conditions, should be changed . 2nd. If Messrs W send coolies they will do so at their own risk since no previous notification has been given to me by the German Consulate as to the date of shipment and name of the ship etc. He should take an early opportunity to give Messrs W the information verbally himself and also tell Hassan to inform them. Perhaps the second reason above can be waived if Hassan will agree to the conditions and send coolies in charge of Hamid. I have asked the Consul at Basrah to ascertain if the S.S.Naseri has been chartered . If Government decide li that the shipment should not be made by Wonckhaus's coolies we could arrange to take the coolies off the Island if they are aant or prohibit the Kaseri from going to Abu Musa. Trevor. Telegram P To Foreign No 183 dated 26.2.10 My immediately proceeding telegram . As stated in the telegram referred to this shipment of 400 tons is apparently made by Hassan bin Samaih. I presume that as we only agreed to le^' Wonckhaus export the oxide to enable them to fulfil alleged forward contracts the facilities granted to Wonckhaus should not be extended to Hassan ? I understood yesterday from the German Consul that he intended to show by his letter of 19th August (forwarded with Resident's letter ^o 2036 of 22 August 1909)that Messrs Wonckhaus were not making the shipment.39 shiprnent,but Colonel Cox did not ( I think^understand this, and certainly I did not. We thought that like the shipment of 1908 this shipment was for W and Co^ I may mention that I hear that 400 tons of the 1908 shipment is still unsold. I am informing the German Consul that without further reference to my Government I unable to agree to Hassan making a shipment on his own account. 4 Trevor.

In continuation, of the correspondence ending witli my telegram No. 186 , of to-day on the subject of the proposed ^ mo.'' 0 '~' Shipment of oxide from Abu Mw, I hare (2) Letter No. 550, dated 26th February 1910, to the honour to forward herewith, for the German vice-Consui. information of the Government of India, copies of two letters which I have addressed to the Acting German Vice-Consul on the subject. 2. As already reported by telegram, I intended to call as soon as possible after Monsieur Wassmuss' return from a short shooting trip, to communicate to him the views of His Majesty's Government on the subject of Messrs. Wonckbaus s proposal to send their own coolies, as set forth in Foreign Department telegram No. S.-101, dated 21st February 1910. On Friday morning last I received a telegram from Henjam from the Eesidency Agent, Lingah (a copy of which I annex), informing me that Hassan bin Samaiyeh had informed him that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. intend to send coolies to Abu Musa within four days to arrange a shipment by Bombay-Persian S.S. I thereupon called on Mr. Wassmuss and explained the views of His Majesty's Government to him, and asked him about the proposed shipment by the S.S. Naseri. I have informed the Government of India by telegram (No. 182 dated 25th February) of the result of this interview. In accordance with Mr.' Wassmuss' request I have sent him a semi-official letter giving him the gist of the views of His Majesty's Government. 3. It appears to me that the fact that the shipment is to be made by Hassan bin Samaiyeh completely alters the position. So far as I am aware we have only agreed to allow Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co to ship oxide to fulfil their alleged forward contracts. It appears to _ me that as, from our point of view, the concession has been cancelled, there is no lore reason that Hassan bin Samaiyeh should ship oxide than that Isa bin Abdul Latif, Messrs. A. an T. J. Malcolm or any other of the partners should do so I have therefore ventured to suggest that this shipment should not be allowed at all. 4 Mr. Wassmuss informed me that he had « all along said that the ship ment was to be made by Messrs. Wonckhaus on behalf of the ' Compagme mMerl' (or words to this effect), and now I see that his letter of August the 19th 1909, is compatible with this. But when this letter was received I did not understand—and I do not think Colonel Cox did fther-that Mr. Wassmuss rntended to inform us that Messrs. Wonckhaus intended to effect a shipment on behalf of Hassan Samaiyeh under the terms of their contract with him which allowed some 400 tons annually to be shipped to India by Hassan. I think Colonel Cox thought, as I did, that Mr. Wassmuss only indulged in the expression « Compagnie miniere' to show that he considered that Messrs. Wonektous &amp; Co. had a share m the eoneem and that the slupment was actually intended for Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. 1 ,, , 5.

You should tell Hassan to inform Wonckhaus of this and also inform them verbally yourself, adding that if they send coolies they will do so at their own risk and that it may be necessary to prevent them going. Could local arrangements be made to prevent coolies ?

The master replied that he would comply with my request, and the ship left for Bahrein on the afternoon of the 2nd March. I venture to call attention to the point that Hassan bin Samaiyeh informed the Captain of the Naseri that he would require his ship to go to Abu Musa when the was at Lingah on the I7th February. It would have been easy for Hassan to have informed Khan Bahadur Agha Bedr of the proposed shipment in time for him to communi cate with me by the Naseri, which arrived here on her upward voyage on the 22nd February; similarly Messrs. 'Wonckhaus &amp; Co. could have communi- cated with their Consul by the same ship. But neither Hassan nor Messrs. Wonckhaus made any communication. Mr. Wassmuss alludes to this in the fourth paragraph of his letter J. No. 97, but passes the matter by lightly. In view of the frequent assurances that we should receive warning of the date of the steamer's arrival, and of the fact that on this occasion a change of procedure, i.e., coolies being sent by Messrs. Wonckhaus instead of by Hassan, was con templated, the failure of either Hassan or Messrs. Wonckhaus to give intima tion of the proposed _ visit of the Naseri until three days before she is due at Lingah must, I think, be regarded as an intentional lapse on their part. 3. As the Sheikh of Shargah has never agreed to Hassan making ship ments, and as in view of the fact that the cancellation of the concession was due to Hassan's fraudulent behaviour, it seemed to me that the Sheikh might very well object to Hassan making shipments. Further, it had become a matter of talk in Lingah that this shipment was for Hassan, and anybody going over to Shargah might bring this fact to the notice of the Sheikh. I therefore thought it might be advisable with a view to preventing all chance of a fracas on the island, to remove any coolies who might have gone there. With this object in view I sent my wire No. 191 of 1st March to the Com mander-in-Chief, but submitted a copy to the Foreign Department in case the Government of India might not approve of my suggestion. Foreign Depart ment Telegram S. 133 was received by me on the 3rd March in time for the Senior Naval Officer to stop any vessel going to Abu Musa without instruc tions from His Majesty's Government. The Commander of H. M. S. Philomel, who called at Lingah on his way to Bushire on the 3rd instant, was able to inform me that no coolies had left, so that as it turned out it would not have been necessary to send a ship to Abu Musa in any case. I attribute the sudden activity of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. at Lingah and of Hassan bin Samaiyeh to the influence of Mr. Brown, who returned from leave by the S. S. Sparta and arrived at Lingah on the 11th February ; further, I am inclined to think that if Mr. Brown had remained at Lingah instead of going on to Bahrein on the 24th February, Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. would have sent the coolies to Abu Musa. 4. I beg to invite a reference to Mr. Wassmuss's letter J. No. 97, and to my letter No. 582 with regard to the question of this particular ship ment, which, it now appears, is for Hassan bin Samaiyeh. In his letterMr. Wassmuss states that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. had fulfilled their forward contracts by the shipment by the Louise I am not aware^ ot the exact terms in which His Majesty's Government granted permission to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. to ship the oxide already mined and piled up, but to the best of my belief the permission was given with a view to prevent Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. incurring great loss through failure to com ply with forward contracts. As they fulfilled these contracts by a shipment nearly two years ago, and indeed have not since attempted to get any more oxide for themselves at all, it appears to me that from a commercial point of view they have no more (if as much) right to the oxide already mined than have the original partners in the concession. I may add that I am credibly informed by Messrs. Strick &amp; Co's. agent that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have still 400 tons of the oxide shipped by the S. S. in April 1908 lying on their hands at Hamburg unsold. 5. Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co's. present tactics seem to be to keep their footing on the island by acting as agents for Hassan bin Samaiyeh and shipping oxide on his behalf, as they do not want any themselves. It seems to me a very topsy-turvey state of affairs that Mr. Wassmuss should seriously ask us to allow Messrs. Wonchkhaus &amp; Co. to send coolies and act on behalf of Hassan. The more so when it is remembered that the alleged reason for Hassan's inability to make the shipment on behalf of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. was that his son Abdullah's presence was considered indispen sable, whereas when Messrs. Wonckhaus propose to send coolies to make a shipment for Hassan, they propose to send coolies in charge of Hassan's brother Hamad. This individual has always done the greater portion of the superin tending work and was in charge of the work in October 1907, when the coolies were removed from the island. 6. -A s Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. fulfilled their forward contracts nearly two years ago and apparently do not desire any more oxide for themselves, it seems to me that the permission to remove oxide from the island should be withdrawn from all alike until the case is settled; and Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. should be called upon to reduce their claim to a cash basis and file a suit against Hassan bin Samaiyeh or, if they prefer, against Hassan and the Sheikh as co-defendant. Arrangements could then be made through Messrs. Malcolm &amp; Co. or in some other manner to sell the mined oxide in the best market, and place the sum realised in deposit against any damages which might be awarded to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. 7. In view of the fact that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have not sugges ted a shipment for nearly two years (out of the four years for which their original contract with Hassan bin Samaiyeh was to last) and of the fact that in two years' time (notwithstanding the alleged forward contracts) they have not been able to dispose of the whole of the 1,800 tons or so shipped by the S.S. Louise, I would not think the damages could be placed at a very high figure, unless they are claimed on ' moral or intellectual' grounds. 8. It would appear to me undesirable that Hassan should be allowed to ship oxide unless we intend subsequently to claim that Malcolm (or any of the other share-holders of the original concession) have an equal right to ship. In any case, I think that the suggestion that Messrs. Wonckhaus have the right to allow Hassan (or any one else) to ship mined oxide, should be resisted, and that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. should be informed that we can neither accept their claim to act on behalf of Hassan nor permit them to send their own coolies to the island to make a shipment either on their own or Hassan's behalf.

Dear Mr. Mallet The following is en extract of a letter I wrote to Colonel Cox a few days ago with reference to the difficulty which the Germans are experiencing in selling the parcel of Abu Musa oxide which they imported into Hamburg about two years ago:- 'So far as I have been able to gather, after a lapse of two years there is still a stock of some 700 tons now lying at Hamburg which Messrs. Trauen, Sturken, and Company, the agents for Messrs. Wonckhaus, find considerable difficulty in selling, even in very small quantities, owing to the quality being in every way inferior to the trial shipment above referred to, being much darker in colour and only having about 60 per cent of its staining power. They are now offer ing this stock at about 48s.,f.o.b. Hamburg, without finding buyers.' WhatI x Hot enclosed What I then wrote has since been confirmed by the fact that Messrs.

Wonckhaus and Company. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose copy of 2 further telegrams 'from the Government of India on the subject. The information now received throws new light on the situation inasmuch as the German Consul has explained that ■ the shipment in question is not on Messrs. Wonckhaus' own ■ account, but 'is one of the shipments to Indie which Hassan is allowed in his contract with Wonckhaus'. As to this it may be observed that the original agreement of 10 April 1898, between Sheikh Salim and Hassan, with the other concessionaires having been cancelled by Sheikh Sagar, His Majesty's Government are in no wsy bound to afford facilities to the British subject Hassan to ship oxide to India from Abu Musa. It is difficult to divine any motive for the intervention of Messrs. Wonckheus end Company in connection with a shipment on Hassan's account except a desire to push their clains as co-psrtners with Hsssan inA- &lt;5 /- K / in view of their purch8se of a share in the concession on the 16th October 1907, His Majesty's Government have already disputed their claims to such co-partnership in the memorandum addressed to the German Government on the 10th July 1908 (para. 3). Viscount Morley is disposed to think that the proposed shipment should not he allowed to taie place unless Messrs. Wonckheus will give en undertaking that it is for the needs of their own firm. He would also suggest that, if Secretary Sir E. Grey sees no ohjection, it should 'be pointed out to the German Government that shipment of oxide on Hassan's account would he inconsistent with the agreement for the non removal of oxide from the island arrived at last year between the two Governments (see Sir 3, Grey's notes of 28 July, 21 September end 13 lovember 1909, and that of the' German Charge d'Affaires dated ,14 August 1909).

Wonckhaus had entered into before the cancellation of the lease having admittedly been satisfied with and by the 'Louise's' shipment of April 1908, we are under no obligation to agree to any further shipments' by them as long as the dispute remains unsettled. 3.

Hardinge on March 30th last, yon stated that recently the British Acting Consiil General at Bnshire had forbidden a British ship, which was to transport ffowAbn Musa to India a consignment of red oxide lying ready for shipment in accordance with the agreement arrived at 'between His Majesty's and the German Governments, to touch at the island with the result that the mineral wan still there. f You stated that you had received instructions to ash His Majesty's Government to direct Major Trevor not to inter fere with the shipment, which would take place in accordance with previous agreement. Sir C. Hardinge replied that no time would be lost in causing enquiries to he made into the matter. This has now 'been done and I have the honour to inform you of the result; In a conversation on August 9th 1909, the German Vice Consul at Bushire informed His Majesty's Consul General that Messrs. 7 /onckhaus wished to remove some more of the oxide accumulated at Ahu Musa, in accordance with the agreement above referred to, and subsequently, in a letter dated August uAugust 19th, explained that 'C'est la oompagnie niniore do Hajji Hassan 'bin Ali .Soraeyye ot Cie. qui veut expedier oes •m 400-500 tonnes d'oxyde et c'ost pour oette compagnie quo la mi son de Wonckhaus s'est adress^e a go Vlco Consulat demandant son assistance Major Oox understood this passage merely to incli cate Ilerr Wassrauss* wish to enphasise the view that a raining company- &gt; existed in which Messrs. Wonckhaus had a sliare; and he therefore found nothing in Herr Wassnruss' remark to modify his previous belief that the proposed shipment was actually intended for the German firm. It was on this assumption that I addressed to Count Metternich my note of ITovember 13th last, informing His Excellency that the shipment might take place. It was not till late in February last that Major Trevor then in charge of His Majesty's Consulate General at Bushire realised that the proposed shipment was to he made on 'behalf, not of Messrs. Wonckhaus, hut of Hassan Samaiye which he con- .M sidered to he a departure from the agreement above referred to whereby Messrs. Wonckhaus alone are entitled to remove the island oxide already rained to enable them to fulfil commercial obligations already assumed. Moreover, in spite of assurances given to His Majesty's Consulate General that the date of the arrival of the steamer by which the oxide was to be shipped would be notified in order to allow time for the necessary Arrangements to be made- . ■ ■ &lt;IW no sufficient notification was received, and a practical obs tacle was then placed in the way of the shipment. In these circumstances, Ilajor Trevor felt obliged to request the master of the steamer not to touch at Abu Ilusa, and this request was complied with. Permission has however now been given for the shipment of the oxide by the same steamer (the Steamship 'ITaseri') altnough, strictly speaking, as it is made on behaLrf of Hassan and not to enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to fulfil their contracts it constitutes a departure from the agreement between the two Governments for the non removal of the mineral from the island. The British authorities, in according this permission, have been influenced by consideration of the misunderstanding which had arisen locally, and by a desire to eliminate a side issue from the main question, but the attitude which they have assumed in this matter must not be construed as indicating that His Hajesty's Government recognise any right on Hassan's part to ship oxide to India on his own account or as prejudicing - their case in respect of the general question under discussion between the two Governments. I have, etc., Sd. E. Grey.IW India Office, 15t]i April 1910- Sir, I an directed by viscount Morley to address you in continua tion of the letter of this Cffioe, dated the 11th instant, en closing copy of correspondence received from India on the 9th idem and of a telegram from the Government of India of the same date, regarding the removal from Ahu Husa of a consignment of 400 tons of oxide. Copy of a subsequent telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 14th April 1910, is also enclosed, reporting that permission to ship this oxide has been already given. On further examination of the matter, Lord Morley is now disposed to think that, notwithstanding what was said in my letter of the 4th ultimo, it was expedient for the reasons given in the telegrams of the Government of India, to allow this shipment to take place, and, subject to Sir E.Grey's concurrence, he would propose to confirm the action taken by the Political Resident. With regard to the reply to 'be made to the enquiry of the German Government of the 30th liar oh, Lord Ilorley would suggest that, if Secretary Sir S.Grey sees no objection, this might be to the effect that the S.S. 'Uaseri' was led to avoid the island of Abu Ilusa, partly in view of the insu- icxent notice of the intention to ship the oxide by that particular steamer■ - I I ■ 1 —(Qf^ steamer, but mainly because the British Acting Consul General had then for the first time come to understand that the shipment of oxide was on account of Hassan, and not for the firm of Messrs. Wonckhaus, to enable them to fulfil their contracts entered into before the cancellation of the lease. It might be added that the British Hote of the 13th November last was written on the assumption that the oxide was intended for the latter purpose, and that, strictly speaking, a shipment of oxide on account of Hassan would, as pointed out in ray earlier letter, be inconsistent with the agreement between the tv/o Governments for the non-removal of oxide from the island. The I Sote might conclude by explaining that Permission has no?; been given for the shipment of the oxide by the S.S.'JIaseri' but that the British authorities in according it have been influenc ed by consideration of the misunderstanding that had occurred, and by a desire to eliminate a side issue, and that they must not be understood as recognising any right on Hassan's part to ship oxide to India on his own account, or in any way orejudicing His liajesty's (rovernment' s case in respect of the general question under discussion between the two Governments. Lord Horley would also call Sir K.Grey's separate atten tion to the statement of the German Vice-Consul that Messrs. Wonckhaus had discharged their forward contracts by their shipment by the 'Louise' in April 190/. The bearing of this may143 may be important if a claim for the firm's damages is preferred hereafter.

I am to inform you in reply that, by the agreement concluded by His Majesty's Government with the German Government for the temporary regulation of the question of the working of the oxide mines on Abu Musa, pending the final settlement of the dispute which has arisen on the subject, all shipments of the mineral are forbidden except to Messrs. Wonckhaus, who are allowed to remove a limited quantity to enable them to fulfil commercial engagements previously contracted. Pei-mission was given for the small shipment, referred to in your letter, under the impression that it was to take place on behalf of that firm, but when it was discovered that this impression was erroneous it was thought better not to withdraw the authorization already accorded, even though it was the result of a misunderstanding,, and the work was therefore allowed to proceed. No further shipments of the kind will, however, be permitted, and, indeed, His.

Foreign Office, 10th January 1908. Sir B. Grey has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the note from the German Charge d'Affaires, dated the 31st December 1907, on the subject of the contract between Messrs. Woncichaus andanative British subject for the purchase of red oxide from the island of Abu liusa. His Majesty's Government fully appreciate the courtesy of the German Government in communicating without reserve the documents in their possession, and the examination Of the German case is being actively pursued. The facts set out in these papers differ materially from those which had been reported to Sir S. Grey / and it will be necessary for His Majesty's Government to apply to the parties concerned for further Information. Sir E. Grey observes that Messrs. Woncichaus claim that they are now partners in the Concession originally granted in 1898, but inasmuch as this concession had been cancelled by the sheikh of Shargah some months before any shareshare therein was transferred to Messrs. Vonckhaus, he cannot admit that they are entitled to assume any such p osition. At the present juncture His Majesty's Government do not think that it would be desirable that the Sheikh of ■ Shargah should permit the Company to resume work at the mines - any attempt to do so might not improbably result in further confusion. His Majesty's Government, however, see no objection to Robert Wonckhaus removing the red oxide, which has already been mined and is now ready for shipment from the island. If this proposal as to the removal of the red oxide in question meets with the concurrence of the Geman Government His Majesty's Government would advise the Sheikh accordingly ' and would arrange for the Indian Government to take whatever step seemed desirable to ijsure that all proper facilities are placed at the disposal of Mr. Wonckhaus for the removal of the oxide, and to prevent any local friction or conflict between Mr. Wonckhaus and the men of the Sheikh of Shargah.m ^■ 0 P■'» ' or isi na l received under P.D.

Major Cox reported early in May that he understood from Hassan Samaiyeh , who had been in consultation with Mr Brown , tht Messrs Wonckhaus had no intention to make any further shipments for the next few months; and he added that, owing to the season of the year , no serious transport operations on the Island were possible for two or three months. There remain on the beacfe some 400 tons of oxide and according to the estimate of Hassan Samaiyeh , about 5000 tons of saleable quality near the mine . These amounts are at the disposal of Messrs Wonckhaus , and Sir Edward Grey is disposed to think that it might be advisable for the local Agent of the firm to give the British Resident timely notice of any further shipments in order that arrangements may be concerted with the Sheikh of Shargah for preventing distur- -bances on the spot .

Last month I visited both Salim and Sagar intending to take up the matter in question but found that existing relations between uncle and nephew made it impracticable and inexpedient to discuss the Abu Musa case on that occasion. The two Sheikhs were resentful and distrustful of each other and neither dared leave his headquarters as it was the height of the pearling season and most of'their dependants were at the pearl banks. I told Sheikh Sagar that I would be ready to give ray good offices,td bring Salim back to the fold,at the end of the pearling season, now nearly over. It is of considerable importance in connection with the Abu Musa case that the previous position and accord between the two should be resto- -red, and I will do my best to bring it about, but I had rather honed that in the meantime matters would have been simplified by adoption of the course suggested last February.

WONCKHAUS and Co ., of Lingali, propose to ship a further 400 to 500 tons of the oxide already ordered (' gefordert ') by them from the Island of Abu Musa. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, the British consul-general at Bushire, has, however, refused to allow the oxide to be shipped, and the efforts of the German vice-consul to obtain a modification of this decision have remained without effect. In their memorandum of the 10th January, 1908, the British Government gave the assurance that all oxide already ordered by the firm of Wonckhaus could be shipped by them, and they confirmed this assurance in their notes of the 4th and 23rd Julv, 1908. In April 1908 Messrs. Wonckhaus shipped a large quantity of the oxide lying on the beach on board the steam-ship u Louise,' but some 400 tons was still left lying on the shore, while about 3,000 tons was lying near the second mine in the interior of the island. In your Excellency's note verbale of the 4th July, 1908, it is expressly mentioned that these two quantities would be at Messrs. Wonckhaus's disposal. Although the firm have repeatedly intended to make further shipments, only one has so far been undertaken in the spring of this year to the extent of about 300 tons, while a request was made for permission to ship 400 to 500 tons. In this case also the British resident raised diffioulties, which were only overcome after a protest had been made by the German Goverment. There can therefore be no doubt that the firm has the right, in view of the existing agreements with the British Government, to dispose of the oxide which is still lying there, and which must amount to more than 3,000 tons. I am therefore instructed to make a protest against Lieutenant-Colonel Cox's action in again raising difficulties in regard to this matter, and in failing to observe the earlier engagements entered into by the British Government. The German Government feel assured that the British Government will without delay address the necessary instructions to their representative at Bushire, in order that he may abandon his opposition to the proposed shipment, and that he may in future act in accordance with the assurances given by hfs Government in regard to this matter. Awaiting your Excellency's reply, I have, &amp;c. P. METTERNICH. [2817 dd—1] E kj This^ DQGuigent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] 1 ^ | ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARAB IA. CONFIDENTIAL. [August 2.] Section 3. w [27196] Sir, No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office. WTrrvrr ^ ■. Foreign Office, August 2, 1910. i\/r - d i r ™ rence your letter of the 20th iiltiino relative to the desire of iessrs. Kobert Wonckhaus and Co. to make a further shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith translation of a note from the German Ambassador at this court, # complaining of the opposition offered to the request of the firm by His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire, and asking that he may be furnished with instructions to abandon it. Sir E. Grey understands that Lieutenant-Colonel Coxs attitude in this matter is based on the view that the contracts into which the German firm had entered before the cancellation of the lease having admittedly been satisfied by the shipment of April 1908 made on board the steam-ship ' Louise,' His Majesty's Government are under no obligation to agree to any further shipments on their behalf so long as the dispute remains unsettled, since to permit such shipments would be to place Messrs. Wonckhaus in a position of unfair advantage in relation to their British competitors, who are precluded from removing any of the mineral from the island at all. Sir E. Grey is far from disputing these facts, and he in no way calls in question the logical soundness of the attitude assumed by Colonel Cox, the more so as it appears to be certain that Messrs. Wonckhaus have even been unable to dispose of a portion of the oxide shipped by them on board the 44 Louise,' and he considers that the following passage which occurs in the note addressed by him to Count Metternich on the 10th July, 1908, ^ can properly be adduced in support of the contention advanced: &lt;c They (i .e., His Majesty's Government) are prepared .... cancellation of the lease.' It must not, however, be forgotten that, on the 10th January of the same year. Sir E. Grey, in a memorandum addressed to the German charge d'afEairs, wrote : ' His Majesty's Government, however, see no objection to Robert Wonckhaus removing the red oxide which has been already mined and is now ready for shipment from the island.'' Again, on the 4th July, writing to Count Metternich of the 400 tons of oxide remaining on the beach and of the quantity lying near the mine, estimated at about 3,000 tons of saleable quality, he said : ' These amounts are at the disposal of Messrs. Wonckhaus.' Finally, on the 23rd July, he informed his Excellency that His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire had informed the German consul on the 8th June preceding u that all the red oxide mined mmht be exported from Abu Musa.' I am to state that, in view of these declarations. Sir E. Grey cannot see his way to support Colonel Cox in his opposition to the proposed shipment, and is disposed, subject to the concurrence of Viscount Morley, to instruct him to allow it to take place without further delay, and to inform Count Metternich of his action. As regards the other point mentioned by Colonel Cox in his letter to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, copy of which was enclosed in your communication above referred to, viz., t^§Jntervention of Messrs. Wonckhaus and of the German consulate at Bushire on behalf of the British subject, Hassan Samaiye, wl'icET'is not raised in pount Metternich's note. Sir E. Grey does not propose to allude toTKe subject' in re^in^ to^is Excellencj. the tlurd le sun 'As'l third sentence in the third paragraph of the Ambassador's communication, I am to state that Sir E.

Ee would accordingly suggest that Count Metternich's attention should be called to the fact, and that it should be pointed out to him that the attitude of His Majesty's consulate-general on that occasion was completely justified by the facts of the case.

'Xo Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, Keaidenoy Agent, L 1 n g a h. a. c. 1 have to inform you that whftle the British Government concur that in view of the fact that Messrs Wonokhaus* forward contracts were oo^pleted by the shipment ta'-en by S.S.'Louise' in April 1908, it can be stated logically that the German firm are not strictly en titled to take any more of the Cx^de yet for fif^dly reasons they do not wi&amp;h to take their stand upon that ar gument and have therefore decided to consent to permission being given to .'.essrs 'onckhaus to make the further shipment from the accumulated oxide which they now desire to prepare, and I am directed to arrange for the same facilities for then as before. In this connection the German Gonsul informs me that Messrs Honckhaus deoire that Hassan Gamaiyeh should be allowed to send about 20 coolies to the island at the end of Ramazan or thereabouts to carry out the work of transporting the stuff to the shore and cleaning it and states that the operation is estimated to take from ■ 6 weeks to two months to complete.I request therefore that you will inform Hasaan Samalyeh that he I ' per mitted in connultatlon with you and on the former oonditiona, 'o send the coolies to the island in charge of Hamad bin Samaiyeh, Abdullah bin Hassan may be allowed to visit the island with a representative of yours if necessary, to point out the stuff to be taken and then return, but he will not be allowed to remain on the island. You will understand that in view of the instructions received by me as above it. has seemed to me unnecessary for Hassan Samaiyeh to be called upon to remove his gear to Lingah tetil this shipment also had been taken. I am writing a letter to Gheikh Suggar to explain the present position of the matter to him and send you a copy of my letter and request that you will write any details tha' may be necessary to Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, as to the duties required from Sheikh Buggar's representative on the island. It will, I fear, be necessary for you as before to ^eep a representative of your own on the island while Hassan's men are there, at all events to begin with; later on it may be sufficient if you visit the island frequently to see that all is well.

Since my return, however, I have re ceived a communication fror Government in which they inform me that the arguments in the case are still going on but will not be concluded for some time yet, and that meanwhile they think the German firm should be allowed to remove the old oxide which is lying there so that the friendly arguments on themerits of the case may not be embittered. They therefore desire me to explain the position to you and ask you to agree to allow Hassan Samaiyeh to send 20 co&lt;blies to the island to bring the oxide to the shore.

ON the 25th instant the German Ambassador reminded His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that his Government had as yet received no reply to the statement of their case respecting the dispute in connection with the 'jmk wor king of the red oxide mines on Abu Musa Island, which was enclosed in his Excellency's note of the 4th December last. Sir E. Grey has the honour to inform Count Metternich, with reference to the conversation above referred to, that the statement of the German case, which was a reply to a communication from His Majesty's Government, dated the 10th July, 1908, was of a nature to require reference to the India Office, to the Government of India, and to His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire, with a view to permit further investigations to be made on the spot, and to obtain additional opinions. Sir E. Grey hastens, however, to assure his Excellency that there will be no unnecessary delay in the preparation of the reply of His Majesty's Government to the= statement in question.

COFPIDENTIAL. [August 22.] Section 2. [30356] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Your Excellency, _ 1910. , ^ t ! le lio^our to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 26th ultimo, relative to the demand of Messrs. Robert Wdnckhaus and Co. to he allowed to ship a lurtiier consignment of red oxide from Abu Musa. + , , I venture to remind your Excellency that in paragraph 28 of the 'complaint' of that nrm against the Sheikh of Sharga, which was communicated to His Maiesty's + . 0V f n T^ ln 1 - r 1011 ® tumm ' s note the 31st December, 1907, it was implied that the nrm had commitments to the extent of at least 2,000 tons of oxide, and that it was o enable them to meet the liability which was thus understood to exist that His ajes y s overiiuieut, in a memorandum dated the 10th January, 1908, consented to the removal from the island of the oxide already mined and ready for shipment. t was equally with, this object in view that similar language was employed in the communications of the 4th and 23rd July. ' That the real intention of His Majesty's Government was to allow Messrs. Wonck- haus, pending the settlement of the dispute, to remove only so much oxide as would enaple them to_ fulfil obligations previously contracted, and not to place them in a position oi unfair advantage over British subjects who were not to be permitted to ship any of the mineral at all, is proved by the authoritative statement of the British attitude contained in the memorandum of the 10th July, 1908, which forms the reasoned reply to _ Herr von Stumm's note above referred to. This statement is as follows : Ihey (i.e., His Majesty's Government) are prepared to use their good offices m order that temporary arrangements may be made whereby Messrs. Wonckhaus will be enabled to procure a limited amount of red oxide to place them in a position to fulfil such contracts as they may have entered into before the cancellation of the lease.' That the firm long ago attained their object is proved by a statement made by the German acting consul at Bushire to the British acting consul-general in an official letter dated the 1st March, 1910, to the effect that they had discharged the obligations which they had contracted by means of the oxide shipped on board the steam-ship Louise (in April 1908), and by the fact, known to His Majesty's Govern ment, that so recently as the spring of this year they still had 400 tons of the mineral belonging to that consignment lying unsold at Hamburg. In these circumstances, I_ cannot but consider that the demand of Messrs. Wonck haus constitutes a clear violation of the spirit of the agreement arrived at by the two Governments, and that the attitude of His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire in opposing that demand was not based on a desire to create mere wanton obstruction, but rather on a determination to carry out the intention of His Majesty's Government as expressed in the memorandum of the 10th July, 1908. His Majesty's Government might therefore fairly have claimed to adhere to the terms of that communication as expressing their real intention, and to interpret in the light of it everything which they have elsewhere written on the subject. In view, however, of the fact that language has been used in notes to you which can be interpreted as an expression of their willingness to allow the removal of all the oxide already mined and lying ready for shipment without reference to the specific requirements of Messrs. Wonckhaus in connection with obligations previously contracted, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that the desired shipment will be permitted, and that Lieutenant-Colonel Cox will be furnished with instructions in this sense. I venture, however, to express the hope that, in view of the explanations now given, the German Government will abstain from supporting any further requests of this nature which Messrs. Wonckhaus may make. I presume that the shipment referred to in the penultimate paragraph of your Excellency's note as having been the object of obstructive action on the part of [2853 2/-2J t .FOHE'lcm OFFIGE TO INDIA (SOS56/10) Sir, I am air&amp;oted hySecret ary aohnowl&amp;age the raoeipt of y.our relative to th&amp; d&amp;mand of IMssWonoHhaus further shipment of red oxide I am to inform you 01. oonours in the view of Visoount should h® made to the note ab German Ambassador to the effect \ trust that, in view of the ex German Govannmant will abstain requests of this nature whioh a paragraph to this eff&amp;ot ioi muni oation» I am, eto, , (Signed) Louis * COPY.no, A5 I,of 1910. -v IT.

Sir — -r o With, reference to your Uo. 299 of the 50th September 1910, to Khan Bahadur Agha Bahadur, re garding the property supposed to have been stolen from the Island of Abu Kusa, I have the honour to inform you that toda3r I summoned Hassan bin Ali Sumaya, who was accompanied by his son Abdulla, and asked them many questions as to when the items contained in the list taken to the Island, and by whom they are supposed to have been stolen. 2_. Both Hassan and Abdulla refused to answer any questions, saying their case was in the hands of their appointed Agents Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Company;/ They however acknowledged the following points:- (1) That all the items contained in the list were the property of Hassan bin Ali Sumaya. (2) That the items contained in the list were taken to the Island at various times, covering a period of about 14 j'-ears; i. e., from the time they commenced removing the oxide, Questioned as to how they presumed that precisely this amount of property contained in theirtheir list, which they acknowledge to have submit ted through Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Company, was stolen, they say the list represents the amount of property which was left on the Island when they were turned out. Further that when AMulla visited the Island with Agha Bader in April last, he noticed that the roof of the godown had fallen in, and that their property had 'been removed. AlDdulla alleges too, that he made .nwW.s frc th. ah.lkh.s A^nt.oa. the Island who told him ohat the property ziad .^eeu carried off by Arah sailors who came there from time to time. Agha Bader says this is false, and it seems highly improhaTole that the Sheikh's Agent could make such a statement considering his business there was to guard the property. 4.. Agha Bader is writing fully in respect to each item contained in the list. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. H. B.

If it meets with your ap proval. I think that before replying to the German Consul he might be asked the following three questions:- (1). as to when i.e.Twhioh dates and year, the things chat Hasan bin Sumaya &amp; Co. allege,have been stolen away from -ohe Abu Musa Island, were taken there; (2). as to what was their quantity or number as the case may be; to what extent they had been consumed or used up; and what remained; (3) . as to by which boat they were carried to the wha^d'' ^ r0m PiaCe 0r POrt the y shipped, and on whao daces. In fact, everything that they have sent to the is- land, was shipped either f rom - 0 iJln agh or other Persian Por.s. ^ this being the oase&gt; ^ a mee oul, ue slllppea w . thout a ^ ^ ^ ohe German Consul replied that •■■ha-' • v 1 ea onao uha ^ ohey were shipped rom iimgah or other ports, Hasan bin Sumaya should be , e ' UPOn U0 proauoe the 'Jawazes'. Prom these ques tions many * useful points would be gained e .g.. tllat ebculd they possess the Customs the latter mus u undoubtedly be in the naane of Hasan bin .Umaya and ln 0116 name 0f ^ 'wonckhaus &amp; Co., as also willMP will ohe dates become known. Then will it, be sufficient ly Proved that nothing having amr concern with the German firm lay on the island: also it would be evident what had been taken to the island and what was used up. But if we shall not proceed like above, I fear it would be cumbrous and the desired end would be diffi cult of attainment. On the 13th of October, Hasan bin Sumaya and Abdullah presented themselves before Mr. New in the mat ter of these alleged missing things, and they were ques tioned by him to state what they knew about them. They replied that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Go. should be questioned on the point, as that Company was their 'Vakil'. Mr. New Gold ohem chat the things that were on the island belong ed go bhem /bo which they said / that the things theirs / but Ghat as Messrs. konckhaus &amp; Co were their agents, the matter concerned that Company. x asked the above three questions in presence of Mr. Hew from Hasan and Abdullah, but they replied in the same way, viz that Messrs, konckhaus &amp; Co should be asked on this subject, I beg to state that Messrs, Vonckhaus &amp; Co had purchased oxide from Hasan bin Sumaya &amp; Co to be deliver ed alongside ship, and nothing else. Consequently there cannou be anyohing oelonging to Vonckhaus &amp; Co on the island. I had rirst thought that the cart which had been brought from Hamburg and is at present lying on the island, oelonged to Messrs. wonckhaus &amp; Go, but it appears now that it belongs to Hasan bin Sumaya &amp; Go. All materi al that is on the island is the property of Hasan bin Sumaya &amp; Co. I beg to enclose the translation of the list furnished by the German Consul with such remarks against each item as I have considered suitable. r.T-i 7 &gt; 0 &gt;u l/l 1 1 p-roCoffee 2 mds Bamboos 70 No.' Oxen 4 No. ' Rs 8 42 70 krs.

I uhmk that most of the things Hasan bin Sumaya had first taken to the island were worn out by use, and now he alleges that they were stolen. If he had in the beginning made over the things in the charge of some one, his present complaint would have had some foundation, but as the fact stands he never gave the things in charge of any one. As regards Sootli and twine that he claims, he should pro duce the 'Jawaz', because I know that most of the oxide that was shipped by 'Lewis' and 'ITaseri' was filled in gunny bags sewn with the very Sootli and twine now alleged to have been stolen away.

The correspondence mainly relates to the claim preferred by the German Consulate at the instance of Messrs. Wonckliaus &amp; Co. for gear said to have been los|} from thf 1 huts on the Island, ,, I not think I need trouble Government, at all events at this stage, with the details of my correspondence with Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, Residency Agent at Lmgah, in connection with the examination of Dr. Listemann's communication ; suffice it to say that the claim appears on enquiry to be almost entirely fictitious-—the Residency Agent believing that the only articles removed were 30 rafters (chandals) which are still probably forthcoming on the island. 3. It Will be seen from Mr. New's letter of 13th October (enclosure No. 6) that Hassan and Abduila were obstructive as usual, refusing to appear until summoned and then declining to answer questions on the ground that they had appointed Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. their Agent. But they said enough to make the extravagant nature of their claim apparent. In reply to Dr. Distemann it seemed to me to be unnecessary for me to touch upon the details or merits of the claim, his title to discuss it with me at all being disputed. I have, however, seen him since the date of my letter and informed him unofficially that though I was not prepared to admit Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. as Hassan's Agents, I should be quite willing, if Hassan Samiyeh lodged his claim as a British subject in the ordinary way, to show him (Dr. Listemann) informally the proceedings in the suit, and suggested that, if he wanted to get the case quickly disposed of as I did, he could co-operate by advising Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. not to encourage Hassan in his objectionable attitude towards His Majesty's Vice-Consulate at Lingah. I now await Dr. Listemann's reply. J. No. 353. Bouchire, le 6 Aout 1910.

They however acknowledged the following points:— (1) That all the items contained in the list were the property of Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh, (2) That the items contained in the list were taken to the Island at various times, covering a period of about 14 years, from the time they commenced removing the oxide. 3. Questioned as to how they presumed that precisely this amount of property contained in their list, which they acknowledged to have submitted through Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. was stolen, they say the list represents the amount of property which was left on the Island when they were turned out. Further, that when Abdulla visited the Island with Agha Badr in April last, he noticed that the roof of the godown had fallen in, and that their property had been removed. Abdulla alleges too that he made enquiries from the Shaikh's Agent on the Island who told him that the property had been carried off by Arab sailors who came there from time to time. Agha Badr says this is false, and it seems highly improbable that the Shaikh's Agent could make such a statement considering his business there was to guard the property. 4. Agha Badr is writing fully in respect to each item contained in the list. Dated 15th Shawal 1328, the 19th October 1910. From— Shaikh Sugo.vr bin Khalid , Chief of Shargah, To— Khan Bahaduk Abdul Latif. After compliments.—1 have duly received the letter from the Eesident, Colonel Cox, and understood its contents. As regards the oxide remaining at Abu Musa island and excavated from the mine by Hassan-bin-Samaiyeh, a discussion took place on this subject before and I expressed my willingness to permit its shipment. Now that the British Agent, Badr, comes there to superintend the shipment, it does not matter, and I have nothing to say against the reply I gave to the Resident. I sent Shaikh Khalid previously to look after the mines on the island and he found that apart from the oxide taken by the Bin Samaiyeh, there remained a heap of oxide from which the Government took a sample. So the Bin Samaiyeh should not meddle with it as it is my property and neither the Bin Samaiyeh nor anyone else has any right thereon. Shaikh Khalid will visit the island and arrange for the people who will have to superintend the shipment. I hope there will remain no further interest for Bin Samaiyeh which may cause trouble for all. I shall write an answer to the Resident's reply, but I address you this for the time being.Mo * 2)0 &amp; I J buahira, / ^ * november 1910.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant relative to the proposal to approach the German Government with a view to effect a compromise in the matter of the concession to work the mines of red oxide on the island of Abn Musa. I am to state that Sir E. Grey agrees with the Earl of Crewe in concurring* m the view of the Government of India, that it would be preferable not to piopose a compromise till the last note of the German Government can be answered in detail, since to adopt the contrary course might make it appear that His Majesty s Government were disposed to offer terms only because they were unable to find an answer to the German arguments, and might in consequence indispose the German Government to adopt a conciliatory attitude. If, on the other hand, the compromise is offered when the reply of His Majesty's Government is presented the friendly intention by which the offer is dictated will be clear, since it will be seen that it is made in spite of the fact that good arguments have been found to rebut the German contentions.^ Sir E. Grev further agrees that it would be well that the precise terms of the proposed compromise should be settled forthwith by consultation between this Office and vour department, and he would suggest that a small interdepartmental confexence between one or two members of each department should take place heie at some time in the near future convenient to the representatives of your Office, at which these details could be arranged. The suggestions of the Government of India on the results of these deliberations could then be invited, and, as proposed in your letter, a settlement arrived at of the question whether or not the German Government should be approached before those suggestions are received. . l l . . . Sir E. Grey shares Lord Crewe's opinion that the new concession should, in justice to the Sheikh of Sharga, contain a provision for the payment to him of a royalty on the oxide mined, and has no objection to offer to the designation of the High Court ol Bombay as the tribunal which should be approached with a view to the deputation ol a judge to assess the damages to be awarded to Messrs. Wonckhaus. . The question whether the clause in the contract between the concessionnaires and Messrs. Wonckhaus, whereby a monopoly of the output of the oxide deposits on Abu Musa is assured to the latter, ought to be eliminated, and that of the source from which the sum required to compensate the German firm should be derived, might also be settled at the proposed interdepartmental conference.

Copy of the present le Government of India. Yours H.B.il. Consul-General &amp; B U S H I B E.■&gt; (11687/11). Foreign Office, gi r) 31st Marcli 1911. With reference to your letter of the 6th instant relative to the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in connection with the shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith draft of a note, which, subject to any modifications which 'Viscount Morley may suggest after consultation with the Government of India, he would propose to address to the German Ambassador, offering to compro mise the matter on the lines laid down at the Inter-departmental Conference which met on 18tb March. The note referred to in the first paragraph of this draft is that in which will be forwarded to Count Metternich the reply of His Majesty's Government to His Excellency's communication of 4th December 1909. This reply cannot, of course, be drawn up till the results of the further enquiry recently made by His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire have been received from the Government of India. i . i As regards the first condition of the compromise proposed m the note. Lord Morley will observe that, in conformity with the recommendation of the conference, allusion is made to Sir E. Grey's note of 22nd August last, in which it was pointed out to Count Metternich that, by the^ admission of the German Vice-Consul at Bushire, the quantity of oxide shipped in April 1908, on board the Steamship 'Louise' was sufficient to enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to discharge all the obligations which they had contracted previous to the cancellation of the concession by the Sheikh of Sharga, and in which it was further stated that some of the mineral belonging to that shipment was then still lying unsold at Hamburg. This reference is included in order to forestall any possible claim for compensation put forward by the firm in connection with alleged inability to fulfil forward contracts by reason of the interruption of their shipments. As regards the second condition, it would seem that, if, as therein pro posed, the unexpired portion of the interrupted contract is allowed to run out from a given date, a claim on account of losses incurred by the inter ruption, in-so-far as the capital sum is concerned, may be avoided, and payment be confined to the interest on that sum which could be fixed at a reasonable rate. t i • - ^ It is recognised, liowever, that Messrs. Wonckliaus, by their contract with Hassan Samaiya, have the option of renewing it on its expiration and that they may therefore be unwilling to accept the view indicated in the preceding paragraph on the ground that it is only tenable in the case of a non-renew able contract definitely terminable on a given date. It has therefore been thought desirable to insert in this second condition a clause which, by annulling Messrs. Wonckhaus' right to renew the contract, makes it possible 'at once to rebut a claim for the payment of a capital sum on account of the period of interruption and to ensure the elimination from any future agreement of the objectionable characteristic of a monopoly. The third condition has been inserted in view of the paramount impor tance of maintaining the view consistently held and expressed by His Majesty's Government since the beginning of this controversy, that the Sheikh of Sharga acted within his rights as the absolute sovereign of his dominions in cancelling the concession, thus insisting on his and then- freedom from liability in the matter and indicating Hassan Samaiya as the only person against whom Messrs. Wonckhaus claim can lie. The question whether the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus should be verified, and the amount of the compensation which His Majesty's Government are willing to pay fixed by a judicial tribunal as proposed in your letter of the 9th ultimo, or merely by the Departments interested, which is one of some difficulty, was not definitely decided by the Conference. The former course, though no doubt it would assure a more thorough examination, offers objections from the point of view of expense and delay ; while, on the other hand, claims fixed by the latter method have perhaps, in some 'cases, been left at an unduly high figure. s. 63.I am accordingly to suggest that the solution of this question should be deferred till the sum claimed by Messrs. Wonckhaus is known, and that, if manifestly moderate, it should be paid after verification by the Departments, and, if excessive, examined and reduced by a Judge deputed by the High Court of Bombay. The point, however, is not, in Sir E. Grey's opinion, one which need be alluded to in correspondence with the German Government, at any rate at the present stage of the discussion. As for the persons to whom the new concession mentioned above in the second condition should be granted by the Sheikh, Sir E. Grey adheres to the views expressed in the letter from this Office of 8th November last, and considers that the matter is one with which, as a transaction between the Sheikh and certain British subjects, the German Government have no concern. He would also abstain from alluding in the note to the proposal to include in the new concession a clause guaranteeing to the Sheikh the payment of a royalty on the oxide mined since, though the profits of the concessionaires would thereby be reduced, the terms of their contract with Messrs. Wonckhaus and the profits of the latter would remain unaffected. As regards the source from which the claim should be met, a point left undecided by the Conference, a further communication will be addressed to you in due course. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State (Sd.) Louis M allet. for India.D raft N ote to the G erman A mbassador. Foreign Office, Your Excellency, March 1911. I have the honour to refer yon to my note of forwarding a memorandum advancing arguments in reply to your communi cation of 4th December 1909 on the subject of the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in connection with the shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa. I am confident that the German Government will not fail to appreciate the cogency of the considerations urged in this memorandum in sup port of the attitude assumed by His Majesty's Government throughout the discussion of this question. That attitude is, in their opinion, com pletely justified by the facts elicited in the course of the further investigations which have been carried out since the receipt of Your Excellency's communication above referred to. They have, however, no desire to protract a discussion which has already lasted more than three years and thus still further to prolong the interruption which an important commercial enterprise has already suffered. His Majesty's Government have been animated from the first by a desire to approach this subject in the friendliest manner, and it is in conformity with the spirit which they have wished to display throughout that they desire to suggest to the German Government that a compromise should be reached on the following lines :— 1. His Majesty's Government, recognising the desire of Messrs. Worickhaus for some compen sation on account of the interruption of their business as the result of the inability of Hassan Samaiya to carry out his contract with them, are willing to facilitate the attainment of that object. They would accordingly suggest that the firm should be asked to submit through the German Government a statement of their claim under this head. As to the amount of the losses so incurred. His Majesty's Government have so far received no precise information, though some light is thrown on the subject by the facts mentioned in para graph 5 of my note of 22nd August 1910. 2. Recognising further the desire of the firm to be restored as far as possible to the commercial position which they occupied at the moment when their operations were interrupted, His Majesty's Government will use their influence with the Sheikh of Sharga to procure from him the grant of a new concession to suitable persons to continue the working of the mines, and will endeavour to arrange that the contract of 1st June 1906 should be allowed to run for a further period equal to that during which it was interrupted. That period was from 10th October 1907 to 1st June 1910. The contract might, for example, run from 1st Mayjiext to 31st December 1913. / In spite of any clause contained in the present contract, the parties shall not be bound after its expiration, to conclude any new agreement. 3. Maintaining in the fullest manner the point of view which they have already expressed that the Sheikh of Sharga, as an absolute sovereign, acted within his rights in cancelling the concession, His Majesty's Government must insist on the principle that neither they themselves nor the Sheikh can be considered to have incurred any liability for the losses suffered by Messrs. Wonckhaus, whose claim lies solely against Hassan Samaiya. His Majesty's Government undertake, however, to use their best endeavours to ensure that the firm should receive such sum in compensation as may finally be fixed. His Majesty's Government have every confi dence that the good intentions which have prompted this offer will be appreciated by the German Go vernment, and that they will see their way to co-operate in the satisfactory settlement of this protracted controversy by recommending to the firm concerned the acceptance of the proposed compromise.

As regards the first condition of the compromise proposed m the note, Lord Morley will observe that, in conformity with the recommendation of the conference, allusion is made to Sir E. Grey's note of 22nd August last, in which it was pointed out to Count Metternich that, by the admission of the German Vice-Consul at Bushire, the quantity of oxide shipped in April 1908, on board the Steamship 'Louise' was sufficient to enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to discharge all the obligations which they had contracted previous to the cancellation of the concession by the Sheikh of Sharga, and in which it was further stated that some of the mineral belonging to that shipment was then still lying unsold at Hamburg. This reference is included in order to forestall any possible claim for compensation put forward by the firm in connection with alleged inability to fulfil forward contiacts by leason of the interruption of their shipments. As regards the second condition, it would seem that, if, as therein pio- posed, the unexpired portion of the interrupted contract is allowed to run out from a given date, a claim on account of losses incurred by the inter ruption, in-so-far as the capital sum is concerned, may be avoided, and payment be confined to the interest on that sum which could be fixed at a reasonable rate. 1 . . x . It is recognised, liowever, thcit Messrs. AVoncklitius, by then contiQct v^itn Hassan Samaiya, have the option of renewing it on its expiration and that they may therefore be unwilling to accept the view indicated in the preceding paragraph on the ground that it is only tenable in the case of a non-renew able contract definitely terminable on a given date. It has therefore been thought desirable to insert in this second condition a clause which, by annulling Messrs. Wonckhaus' right to renew the contract, makes it possible at once to rebut a claim for the payment of a capital sum on account of the period of interruption and to ensure the elimination from any future agreement of the objectionable characteristic of a monopoly. The third condition has been inserted in view of the paramount impor tance of maintaining the view consistently held and expressed by His Majesty's Government since the beginning of this controversy, that the Sheikh of Sharga acted within his rights as the absolute sovereign of his dominions in cancelling the concession, thus insisting on his and then- freedom from liability in the matter and indicating Hassan Samaiya as the only person against whom Messrs. Wonckhaus' claim can lie. The question whether the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus should be verified, and the amount of the compensation which His Majesty's Government are willing to pav fixed by a judicial tribunal as proposed in your letter of the 9th ultimo, or merely'by the Departments interested, which is one of some difficulty, was not definitely decided by the Conference. The former course, though no doubt it would assure a more thorough examination, offers objections from the point of view of expense and delay ; while, on the other hand, claims fixed by the latter method have perhaps, m some cases, been left at an unduly high figure. s. 63.I am accordingly to suggest that the solution of this question should be deferred till the sum claimed by Messrs. Wonckhaus is known, and that, if manifestly moderate, it should be paid after verification by the Departments, and, if excessive, examined and reduced by a Judge deputed by the High Court of Bombay. The point, however, is not, in Sir E. Grey's opinion, one which need be alluded to in correspondence with the German Government, at any rate at the present stage of the discussion. As for the persons to whom the new concession mentioned above in the second condition should be granted by the Sheikh, Sir E, Grey adheres to the views expressed in the letter from this Office of 8th November last, and considers that the matter is one with which, as a transaction between the Sheikh and certain British subjects, the German Government have no concern. He would also abstain from alluding in the note to the proposal to include in the new concession a clause guaranteeing to the Sheikh the payment of a royalty on the oxide mined since, though the profits of the concessionaires would thereby be reduced, the terms of their contract with Messrs. Wonckhaus and the profits of the latter would remain unaffected. As regards the source from which the claim should be met, a point left undecided by the Conference, a further communication will be addressed to you in due course. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State (Sd.) Eouis Mallet. for India.-0 ENCLOSURE. Draft Notk to the German Ambassador. Foreign Office, Your Excellency, March 1911. I have the honour to refer you to my note of forwarding a memorandum advancing arguments in reply to your communi cation of 4th December 1909 on the subject of the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in connection with the shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa. I am confident that the German Government will not fail to appreciate the cogency of the considerations urged in this memorandum in sup port of the attitude assumed by His Majesty's Government throughout the discussion of this question. That attitude is, in their opinion, com pletely justified by the facts elicited in the course of the further investigations which have been carried out since the receipt of Your Excellency's communication above referred to. They have, however, no desire to protract a discussion which has already lasted more than three years and thus still further to prolong the interruption which an important commercial .enterprise has already suffered. His Majesty's Government have been animated from the first by a desire to approach this subject in the friendliest manner, and it is in conformity with the spirit which they have wished to display throughout that they desire to suggest to the German Government that a compromise should be reached on the following lines :— 1. His Majesty's Government, recognising the desire of Messrs. Wonckhaus for some compen sation on account of the interruption of their business as the result of the inability of Hassan Samaiya to carry out his contract with them, are willing to facilitate the attainment of that object. They would accordingly suggest that the firm should be asked to submit through the German Government a statement of their claim under this head. As to the amount of the losses so incurred, His Majesty's Government have so far received no precise information, though some light is thrown on the subject by the facts mentioned in para graph 5 of my note of 22nd August 1910. 2. Recognising further the desire of the firm to be restored as far as possible to the commercial position which they occupied at the moment when their operations were interrupted. His Majesty's Government will use their influence with the Sheikh of Sharga to procure from him the grant of a new concession to suitable persons to continue the working of the mines, and will endeavour to arrange that the contract of 1st June 1906 should be allowed to run for a further period equal to that during which it was interrupted. That period was from 10th October 1907 to 1st June 1910. The contract might, for example, run from 1st Mayo next to 31st December 1913. In spite of any clause contained in the present contract, the parties shall not be bound after its expiration, to conclude any new agreement. 3. Maintaining in the fullest manner the point of view which they have already expressed that the Sheikh of Sharga, as an absolute sovereign, acted within his rights in cancelling the concession, His Majesty's Government must insist on the principle that neither they themselves nor the Sheikh can be considered to have incurred any liability for the losses suffered by Messrs. Wonckhaus, whose claim lies solely against Hassan Samaiya. His Majesty's Government undertake, however, to use their best endeavours to ensure that the firm should receive such sum in compensation as may finally be fixed. His Majesty's Government have every confi dence that the good intentions which have prompted this offer will be appreciated by the German Go vernment, and that they will see their way to co-operate in the satisfactory settlement of this protracted controversy by recommending to the firm concerned the acceptance of the proposed compromise. in Dimi-Official dated 7th April ' Addition proposed letter to Ifoje* Cox, 1911 [If Messrs.

You are aware that in the friendly negotiations between the British Government and the German Government, it was de cided that pending the production by the parties of their evi dence and arguments and the adjustment of the dispute the former concessionaires should be allowed to fulfil their engage ments and remove the oxide which had already been mined b^ them. Unfortunately the arguments have taken a long tirae, but His Majesty's Government are doing all they can to bring the matter to an early conclusion and it is hoped that this will not be long delayed. Meanwhile if Government decide that iiassan Samaiyeh, in order to avoid subsidiary disputes must be allowed to take portions of what is mined, Sheikh Sagar's ultimate interests will not suffer thereby and he must trust to me and to Government to safegurd them. It follows that if Hassan Samaiyoh's people or Agha Bedr's proceed to the island, I am responsible. Sheikh Sagar need not be alarmed. What is necessary for him is that persons remaining on the island from his side should be his own loyal servants and no one else.

As a matter of fact, I never intended that they should be sent here; I ordered Hassan to produce them and warned him that I could not proceed with the case until he did, and all I really wanted was that Agha Badr should let me know when they were forthcoming. The case will have to be continued on the spot as soon as 1 can arrange. 1 expect to have to come down Gulf soon and will call for the purpose. Will you kindly explain to Agha Badr. I do not want you as V.G. to have anything to do with the Abu Musa case, or with the Samaiyehs in that connection, so please do not take any action at Agha Badr's suggestion without reference to me. The reason is that we do not want to do anything to give a handle to the Germans to bring the case into Persia and try and work through Legation.

It is followed by 1B, and then by folio number 2. After folio number 3 the sequence jumps straight to number 5 – there is no number 4. The sequence then runs through to 120. Number 121 has been missed out, so folio number 120 is followed by number 122. The sequence then continues through to 381, which is the inside of the back cover of the volume. It should be noted that letters have been used to number folios at two other points in the sequence: 229 is followed by 229A; and 329 is followed by 329A.
