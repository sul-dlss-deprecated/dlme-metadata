This work presents a collection of difficult words and expressions found in classical Arabic literary texts. For each word or expression, the author offers a number of synonyms and paraphrases intended to guide the reader to a better understanding of the lexical, grammatical, and syntactical peculiarities of the language used by authors writing in classical Arabic. There are no explicit references to the literary works where these expressions are found; they are all introduced by the phrase “it is said.” Qur'anic verses are mentioned as well, when the features discussed in the chapters have parallels in the Qur'ān. An index to all the expressions analyzed in the book and a word index conclude the work.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Grammar</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Beirut</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Lebanon</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabic language</topic></subject><subject><topic>Koran -- Commentary</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/12939#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
