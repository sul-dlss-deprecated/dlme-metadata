An attempt at chronological order has been made, with the majority of correspondence running from the earliest piece at the beginning of the volume to the last piece at the back. However, there are numerous exceptions to this rule, possibly as a result of Agency staff trying to collate correspondence by topic rather than by order of receipt or despatch.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation system begins at the front cover and runs through to the last page of text in the volume. Six blank pages at the end of the file, as well as the inside back cover, are unfoliated. The foliation system is written in circled pencil in the top-right corner of the recto side of each folio. A second foliation system runs from ff 1g-28; this sequence is written in blue crayon and circled. Foliation anomalies: 1A, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f and 1g; 93a and 93b.A number of folios have fold-outs.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains correspondence on a range of issues related to the running and organisation of the Bahrain customs house.
