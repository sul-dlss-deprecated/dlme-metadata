The file includes enquiries from The Cement Marketing Company Ltd, London, about the amount of cement imported into Bahrain for each of the years 1929-1933, to which the Agency provided statistics in response. The enquiries were then discussed in correspondence, dated 1935, between the Political Agent (Percy Gordon Loch) and the Political Resident (Trenchard Craven William Fowle), and the Agent was instructed in future to forward such enquiries to the Department of Overseas Trade. The papers also cover the importation of 'poor quality' Japanese cement, starting in 1934; correspondence with the Office of the Indian Government Trade Commssioner on imports of cement to Bahrain, dated 1940-1941; and related papers.
