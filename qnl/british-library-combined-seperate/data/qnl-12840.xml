Also reported on are matters relating to Bushire itself including outbreaks of Fever and Cholera, and the need for a British India Steam Navigation Company representative in Bushire to assist with the sending of mail and packages to and from Bombay and Tehran.Edwards also provides reports for Pelly on matters in the Gulf which are primarily focused on the ongoing dispute between the Wahabis and the Sultan of Muscat, but later focus on the situation in Muscat following the death of Sultan Thuwaini bin Said in 1865, his son Salim II bin Thuwaini becoming Sultan and the opposition to this from his uncle Turki bin Said who eventually takes control and becomes Sultan in 1868.Also reported on frequently are matters in Persia, relating to internal politics, the Telegraph system and a territorial dispute with Afghanistan over Seistan; and the movements of various vessels around the Gulf including the
