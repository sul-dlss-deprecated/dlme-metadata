Wright Cyclone engines. These aircraft are said to he identical with the existing equipment of the fighter squadrons of the United States Army Air Corps, and my informant is surprised at the willingness of the American authorities to allow their export. They have been furnished through a local firm of agents of Siamese nationality, Messrs. Suphan Panich. 2. My informant adds that twenty-four of the aircraft in question have been ordered, but he does not know exactly when the remaining twelve are due to arrive. He describes the machines as being exceptionally formidable and the best of the kind which can be supplied from the United States. They are designed for offensive use against ground troops and for defensive use against hostile aircraft, and the possession of twenty-four of them should have for result the doubling of the effective interceptor strength of the Siamese Air Force.

This letter was communicated by Mr. Leatherbarrow to His Majesty’s Minister at Bangkok, who is at present on leave in this country. 2. Mr. Eden is not aware whether the machines which the Siamese wish to buy can be sold abroad. If* however, there is no difficulty as regards this, he hopes that it will be found possible to enable the manufacturers to quote for the small numbers for which the Siamese Government are at present asking and to guarantee delivery within a reasonable period, since it appears to him likely that in the event of a foothold being secured in the Siamese market larger orders would be forthcoming at a later date. 3.

Dear Mr. LeatherLarrow, There appears to have been trouble of some sort or another at the R.A.D, in regard to American machines. What it is I do not know, but we were privately advised yesterday that a conference of all executive officers was being held at Don Muang to discuss the matter and this morning we were requested to ascertain whetlier certain British aircraft could be purchased, so that it looks as if our information is correct. As regards British Aircraft, the R.A.D. do not consider the possibilities of their being able to get any very good, in which generally speaking they are undoubtedly correct, but in view of the possibility - if not the apparent probability - of there having been a rift in the pro-American complex, I am wondering whether you can, with the help and assistance of everyone you know and those who can help whom you may not know, do something to enable us and British Aircraft to get back into the field here. Sir Josiah Crosby has been v/orking like a Trojan to get better facilities in the British Air Force and has succeeded up to a point and in addition to others I suggest he/ H. Leatherbarrow, Esq., London.he would he a most valuable person to enlist To be able to put forward offers - with complete details as to performance, and a promise of delivery - I imagine very special permission from the Air Ministry will be necessary, but this is what we want you to move Heaven and Earth to do for us. Single seater fighters is the type in question and amongst others those on which offers are required are:- Gloster Gladiator (Bristol Mercury VI engine) Vickers Venom (Bristol Aquila. ) The above are the only two I know of fitted as standard with air cooled engines, which is the only class of engine the R.A.D. will consider. In addition the following would be of interest if Air cooled engines could be fitted:- Vickers Spitfire Hav/ker Hurricane Hawker High Speed Fury Fairey Firefly II Will you please see what can be done. I cannot too strongly emphasise both the urgency and the importance of this matter. We have a chance of getting in again if the Air Ministry v/ill back us up. Quotations, if particulars and delivery can be granted, are required for 3, 6, 9 and 12 machines though I believe that if any one type were adopted, orders for even more than 12 machines would be forthcoming over a reasonably short period. It/It will 1)6 appreciated that the Gloster Gladiator and Vickers Venom, being already fitted with Air cooled engines, are the most likely and should therefore in the first instance be concentrated upon and in this connection would mention the agency for Bristol engines, with which these planes are fitted. If we can get offers of machines then I think it very important we should try again for the engine agency. Prance and Italy are also likely to be approached we ourselves are writing to Ducrocq - so we must be quick. I feel I have not sufficiently indicated how very important I consider this matter to be, but I believe you will appreciate it and do all you can. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A.A. GENTRY. P.S.

CONFIDENTIAL. 3rd July, 1937 BANGKOK, Sir, In my despatch No. 204 (20D/29/37) of the 26th May I had the honour to report the arrival of the first Martin bomber for the Siamese Air Force adding that the order would be completed by two more machines. I am now given to understand that the order is for six machines also that an American pilot is soon arriving from China to give instruction in flying twin-engined airplanes, for hitherto the Siamese have only possessed single-engined machines. 2. In this connexion Mr. Gentry, the energetic managing d.irector of Messrs. Barrow, Brov/n and Company Limited, agents here of the Vickers group, tells me that he believes that something has happened to set the Siamese against American aircraft. Precisely what it is he does not know, but he appears firm in his belief. He finds confirmation in an enquiry made to him by the Director of the Air Force Workshops, who wished to know v/hether Mr. Gentry’s firm could supply British single-seater fighters. The Director especially mentioned Vickers-Venom and Gloucester Gladiator machines j and. Mr. Gentry is anxious that, if Mr. Leatherbarrow, the representative in England of Messrs. Barrow Brown, should apply for them, permission may/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, P.c., M.C., M.P.,3 I *'46 may 'be given to manufacturers to supply specifications and performance figures and eventually the machines themselves, of which twelve was the figure mentioned as a probable requirement, Mr, Gentry asked me to v/rite to you in his support, I told him that I would v/rite at once by air mail, but did not say that I would support him, 3, Mr. Gentry is, naturally enough, enthusiastic, arguing that, if we supply machines now to the Siamese Air Force, v/e shall gain an unshakable footing in that Force for our aircraft. It is a weighty argument deserving of careful consideration, but I would not go so far as to say, on the information so far supplied by Mr. Gentry, that it is so v/eighty as to justify our giving away what I presume are confidential designs and figures. If the designs and figures are no longer confidential, or unlikely to be so much longer, I would urge that Mr. Gentry's wishes be met if it is at all possible to meet them. But if they are confidential and likely to remain so for some little time I desire to do no more than submit Mr. Gentry’s case for consideration. 4.

Aerodrome to have fighters of modern type only and he second to none * With reference to the statement made by Colonel Luang Pibul Songgram, State Councillor for Defence, at the christening ceremony at Don Muang at the 'beginning of the year, announcing that this country had purchased construction licences for Hawk machines of the latest type, we now learn that the Don Muang authorities wish snortly to station there exclusively modern fighting machines, in order to render the aerodrome second to none in the Par East. There are at present 36 Hawk machines at Don Muang, a number which will be increased in the near future. The Air Department at Don Muang has transferred many old type fighters both to the aerodrome at Kokethiem and to that at Prachuab Kirikhand, in order to replace machines beyond repair and unsuitable for training work. As a matter of fact, so our representative was informed by Commander Luang Yuddhasastra Kosol, R. N., Secretary to the State Councillor for Defence, there is nothing new or unusual in the wish to staff Don Muang exclusively with modern type Hawk machines and send old types away to tne aerodromes at Prachuab Kirikhand and Kokethiem, for aeroplanes are like warships: when mucu used they must be withdrawn and others must be built to replace them. The old maCiiines which the Air authorities at Don Muang are putting out of use may be said to be out-of-date because their speed is much less than that of the Hawks; and it is therefore necessary as a matter of routine to replace the old type machines, if sufficient funds are available, by purchasing Hawks, as we have already explained.CO &gt;Y •' W I ' i y )' y (F 7848/1610/40) No. 390 (17/3**, 35). CONFIDENTIAL. BRITISH LiiXlATION, BANGKOK, NovcmLcr 14th, 1935. Sir, In Mr. Bailey’s despatch No. 179 of May 28th last it is stated that the Siamese Government would probably order six Curtis twin-engined bombing machines for their Air Force. I am now informed on gooa authority that it is not likely that this order will be pltsceu but that, on the other hand, some (if not all) of the twelve Curtis Hawk single-seater fighters, to which Mr. Bailey also referred as having been already ordered, have actually arrived here. Acceptance tests are in process of being made on these machines, which are guaranteed to attain a speed of 245 miles per hour at sea-level; the first machine to be tested achieved 248 miles. 2. My informant likewise tells me that an aeronautical engineer from the Curtis Aright factory is now in Bangkok, where he is expected to remain for at least six months. nis mission is to train the Siamese Air Force in builaing further aircraft themselves, the Siamese Government having purcnasea from the Curtis Aright Company the local construction rights in their products. In practice, I understand that these rights «ill only be exercised as regards the building of the air—frame a, the engines being imported as before. I understand further that a start is actually about to be made here with the construction of the first batch of home-made single-seaters, though my informant thinks that a considerable time will elapse oeiore they are finally turned out. He adds that the Giamese are making enquiries with a view to the purchase of two twin-engined medium range communications aircraft.&amp;J 3* An idea of the present strength of the Siamese Air Force may he gained from the circumstance that, on the recent visit of the 'Augusta', the flagship of the Admiral Commanuing the United States naval forces in the Far .aiat, 104 Siamese mac nines flew over that vessel by squadrons, to the no small surprise of the visitors. ky informant states that the number of competent Siamese pilots now amounts to aoout 150, none of whom, however, have haa any proper training in navigation.

You were so kind as to add that in the event of the invitation being accepted, a cordial welcome will be given to the Siamese airmen I and that every assistance in arranging the details of the visit and in carrying it out will be given by your Legation and all other British authorities concerned. I have duly transmitted the contents of your letter to His Highness the Minister of War who* warmly appreciates the friendly spirit which prompts the Government of India to issue the above invitation as well as the promise of welcome and assistance to the Siamese airmen, I have now the honour to I inform you that, deeply sensible of this mark of friendship. His Majesty's Government has much pleasure in accepting the invitation so cordially extended to them. Accordingly they would propose to send the Paribatra Squadron consisting of three military aeroplanes under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Luang Neramit Baijayont with the following pilots and mechanics: Captain Chang Nitinandana ) ) Captain Krishna Purnasumriddhi) pilots ) Lieutenant King Balanusonti ) SergeantSergeant Sinuan Makbanij ) ) mechanics Lance Corporal Chuen Mekapayom ) on a visit to India arriving at Delhi on the 1st January next. In order to relieve the airmen from any undue strain upon their machines. His Highness the Minister of War expresses the wish that the flight should be undertaken by short stages and proposes the following itinerary: Donmuang - Rangoon - Akyab - Calcutta - Allahabad - Delhi. The exact date of depart ure from Donmuang and of arrival at each stopping place will be communicated to me as soon as fixed. In this connection it is also proposed to send Captain Luang Takol Napakas, with necessary spare parts and accessories, to see to ground arrangeraents and to act as liaison officer at the various stopping places in advance. This Officer will leave Bangkok by train on the 4th December for Penang, whence he will travel to Rangoon, Akyab, Calcutta, Allahabad and Delhi, arriving at the latter place on about the 25th December. I need hardly add that any facility and assistance which the Government of India may extend to this officer in the performance of his mission will be gratefully appreciated. His Highness the Minister of War further expresses the wish to receive copies of plans of the landing grounds, meteoro logical reports of the season, rules or regulations or any other informations which the airmen should be acquainted with concerning the various aerodromes or landing grounds along the above itinerary. I shall therefore be much obliged if through your good offices the same may be supplied to the Siamese airmen concerned before their departure. His Highness also requests me to convey to you and through you, to the Government of India, the sincere thanks and appreciationappreciation of His Majesty 1 s Government and those of his own for this kind invitation as well as for the ready offer of assis tance of your Legation and the British officials concerned.

In this connection the Air Council think it may be of interest to the Secretary of State for India to know that there is good reason for thinking that the re equipment of the Siamese Air Force on a large scale will be necessary in the near future, and that the chief interest of the Siamese in visiting India will probably lie in the study of equipment and the performance of aircraft.

'•'•w Bangkok, (6/14/29) 24tia September, 1929. 0 * My dear George, Prince bovaradej, the Minister of War, spoke to me to-day at the hoyal liolf Ulub on the subject of a possible visit by Siamese aeroplanes to India. He said that last March Major U.L.W. jjarwin, who Is a friend of his, had been visiting Hengkok and had told him that Air vIce- Marshal sir W.ii. Salmond, Officer commanding the noyal Air Porce In India, would be very pleased If Siamese aviators would pay a visit to India. His Serene Highness was not sure how far this was a mere polite phrase, or whether It was really meant; but, If a visit would be welcome, he was all In favour of the Siamese Army keeping in touch with the forces of Siam's neighbours. Siamese aeroplanes were to visit Hanoi and Cochin China in December; and he would gladly arrange for a visit to India afterwards, if the time was convenient. He must, however, have an official invitation; as there had been contretemps in the past due to their having accepted invitations conveyed by unauthorised persons, and he wanted to avoid any misunderstanding. He was therefore thinking of writing to i.Iajor Darwin to ascertain how the land lay and to say that. If an invitation were sent through the proper channel, he would gladly accept it. fihat did I think about the matter? I said 1 thought he was very wise. 1 felt no doubt that the Indian aviation authorities would be delighted to have a visit from their Siamese colleagues; and Major Darwin could let it be known that an invitation through the proper channels would be welcome. 1 thought that that would G.A. Mounsey, Hsq. , C.M.C. , O.H.ji., be / etc., etc., etc.be through His -iajesty's Legation, and that the foreign Office would have to be consulted; and I was quite ready to write and inform the jroreign Office what had transpired, so that there should be no unnecessary delay, if they were approached by the Indian authorities. 1 need not tell you that I think it would be an excellent idea that Siamese aviators should be encouraged to visit India, where they can doubtless be inspired with a desire to acquire much material from ureat Britain. 1 hope therefore that, if the Air Ministry or the India Office consult you about this plan, you will give it your blessing. Please see in this connection my despatch No. 127 of July 27th and previous correspondence respecting aviation in this country. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Charles Wingfield.- i 155 / 38 / 29 . K0.127.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. fj ~ t-l O / •\^1925/157/40] No. 1. Mr. Waterlow to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received April 24.) (No. 50.) Sir, Bangkok, March 19, 1928. I HAVE the honour to submit the following account of the recent visit of H.M.S. “Hermes” (Captain Geoffrey Hopwood, C.B.E., R.N.) in amplification of the telegram No. 10 of the 14th instant, in which I reported that the visit had been a great success. 2. The “ Hermes ” having arrived off the bar of the Menam River at 7 a.m. on the 9th instant, Captain Hopwood and a number of officers, accompanied by Mr. Vice- Consul Bird, whom I had sent on board to meet them, reached the Legation in time for luncheon. Captain Hopwood, Commander R. Ramsbottom, R.N., and Wing-Com mander H. J. F. Hunter, R.A.F., were my guests during the visit. On the evening of the 9th I gave a dinner party in their honour at which His Royal Highness the Prince of Nagor Svarga (the Minister of War, who is also at the moment Acting Minister of Marine) was present, as well as Rear-Admiral Phya Rajawangsan (who had been instructed by the Minister to co-operate with me in the arrangements for the visit, and to act as liaison officer during its course), Major-General Chaloem Akas (Director- General of the Air Force) and a number of other Siamese officers. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was prevented from coming by a death in his family. Other officers of the “ Hermes,” some thirty in all, arrived the next day and were the guests of various members of the British community. 3. Unfortunately the main features of the programme originally arranged for Saturday, the 10th March, had to be abandoned. The demonstration of aircraft which the Air Ministry had suggested might be held at Don Muang, the aerodrome an hour’s train journey north of Bangkok (see , 70111 - telegram No. 3 of the 1st January last), proved to be impracticable. 1 was also obliged to cancel the ball at the Legation which I had arranged for that evening. 4. It was not possible for the aircraft to fly to Don Muang and remain on view there because they were fitted with floats and therefore could not land. It was therefore proposed that they should fly over Bangkok instead and return to the ship. But this also turned out to be impossible owing to strong southerly winds, which raised a moderate swell off the bar, making departure from the stationary ship dangerous. In these circumstances it was thought best to substitute the arrangements described in paragraph 7 below. 5. The cancellation at the last moment of the ball at the Legation, for which all preparations had been made, was regrettable, as it would have given an opportunity for practically all the Siamese princes and high officials, the diplomatic and consular bodies, and the British and other foreign communities to meet the officers of the “ Hermes ” in suitable surroundings. As reported in my despatch No. 46 of the 15th instant, the death of the French Minister on the morning of the 9th instant, followed by the funeral on that of Sunday, the 11 th, made this impossible. 6 . There is no doubt nevertheless that the visit was, as 1 have said, a great success. It deeply impressed the Siamese, and it was warmly welcomed by the British community. Sports fixtures (football and hockey) were arranged for the men, and were greatly appreciated ; also, thanks to the generosity of British residents, luncheons for the men on the 10 th, 11 th and 12 th. The naval ratings were taken sightseeing by their Siamese opposite numbers and given tea on each day. The naval vessels put at our disposal by the Siamese Government enabled half the ship’s company and more than thirty officers to visit Bangkok, the journey being made by water to Paknam at the mouth of the River Menam, and thence by electric train. On the evening of the 11 th the Prince of Nagor Svarga entertained eleven of the officers at dinner, when Mrs. Waterlow and myself and Mr. Consul-General Johns and Mrs. Johns were present. But the outstanding events of the visit were the proceedings of the two following days. [440 aa—3]2 7. On the night of the 11th the officers returned to the ship, which then moved away some 20 miles to a smooth anchorage near the Island of Kohsichang. The object of this was two-fold : to allow visitors from Bangkok to board the “ Hermes ” without danger and inconvenience, and to make sure of smooth water for flying demonstrations. On the morning of the 12th a party of some sixty persons proceeded to the ship in a Siamese naval vessel, the “ Chao Phya” ; it included two of the cflr 1 Royal Princes—Prince Bhanurangsi and the Prince of Nagor Svarga—with a daughter apiece, Mrs. Waterlow and myself, the Chief of the General Staff, the head of the Siamese air service, the rear-admiral in charge of the arrangements on the Siamese side, and a number of leading British residents with their ladies. On arrival the “ Chao Phya ” was received with a royal salute, and their Royal Highnesses, going on board the “ Hermes ” with Mrs. Waterlow and myself, were received with musical and military honours and inspected the guard. The rest of the party then came on board and luncheon was served. A most impressive demonstration by the aircraft followed, in perfect weather and without mishap. The party left for Bangkok at 4 p.m. 8 . I remained on board for the night as the guest of Captain Hopwood, and was thus able to be present when their Majesties the King and Queen arrived in the royal yacht at 10 a.m. next day. The procedure observed was similar to that of the day before. After Captain Hopwood had called on the rear-admiral commanding the royal yacht their Majesties came on board, accompanied by three aides-de-camp and two ladies-in-waiting, and the King inspected the guard. The royal party then partook of light refreshments, and a display of flying was given, after which His Majesty went over the ship and ascended the superstructure to the crow’s-nest. At noon I accompanied their Majesties back to the yacht, where the King held me in conversation for some time, expressing the utmost enthusiasm for all that he had seen. His eager excitement w r as remarkable, and I have no doubt that the impression made on him and on the princes and other high Siamese personages is one that will not quickly fade. 9. When I had returned to the “ Hermes ” for luncheon the royal yacht weighed anchor and proceeded to Bangkok in the evening. At 2 p.m. I returned in the “ Chao Phya,” which had been put at my disposal, and the “ Hermes ” left for Hong Kong. I enclose the texts of the telegrams exchanged . 0 10. All the arrangements had been carefully worked out in advance by my staff in co-operation with the Siamese naval authorities, who were most helpful in every way and spared no pains to make the visit a success. The result was that no hitch of any kind marred the atmosphere of genuine cordiality and friendliness that prevailed. I am reporting in a separate despatch on the possible results of the visit. 11 . This visit and that of the Governor of the Straits Settlements which preceded it at a short interval, greatly appreciated though they were, have imposed a considerable strain on my staff, which, as you are aware, is below its proper strength. But for the untiring labours of all concerned, and especially of Mr. Consul-General Johns and of Mr. Vice-Consul Bird, who both displayed remarkable organising ability, there would certainly have been breakdown and confusion. I count myself fortunate in having been able to rely at this juncture on two such painstaking and capable officers. 12. Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Governor of the Straits Settle ments and to the Commander-in-Chief, China Station. I have, &amp;e. S. P.

Waterlow to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received April 24.) (No. 51. Confidential.) Sir tta/tt? n u • , , Bangkok, March 19, 1928. I IMF will be required to show whether the visit of H.M.S. £ ‘ Hermes,” reported 1I1 , &lt; es j?^ c .^ 0 • ^ fo-day s date, is likely to produce tangible results. Mean- v nile the lollowmg observations may be of interest: 2 . I he aircraf t demonstrations were extremely effective and admirably staged fi £ reSenC i the personages whom it was most desirable to impress, not only Ar KlI ! g Princes ’ one of whom (Prince Paribatra of Nagor Svarga, the Minister of War) is the paramount force in this country, but of all the principal technically competent officers, several of whom were taken up as passengers. Of the impression made there can be no question. For instance, during the demonstration on e th March the Minister of War turned to the head of the air force, after three machines had swooped down on the ship with their wings apparently almost touching, and said to him : In future you have got to fly like that.’’ General Chalerm Akas^s lace tell, and one wonders whether, if an attempt is made to carrv out this Roval command, any aircraft will be left in Siam. 3. This impression, again, was made at the right psychological moment, since, as you are aware, Siamese air policy is now in the melting-pot. But, even assuming that the Siamese Government have, as everything indicates, made up their mind to leoigamse and re-equip their air arm as a thoroughly modern fighting force, and that they recognise (as I believe they do) that British engines and methods are the best m j e w • . ’ cloes not follow that they will now turn to us for engines, material ^ framing. All that can be said is that the spectacle provided by i. l.S. Hermes a spectacle which I took care to impress upon the King had been granted to no other foreign Power—will probably influence them strongly in the desired direction. I doubt whether the question of price will be a serious stumbling- block. Hie Prince of Nagor Svarga went out of his way while on board to say that our engines were too expensive for him, but this mav be bluff. There is plenty of money m the Treasury, and every prospect that the necessary appropriations for an ambitious reorganisation can be made in the course of the next few years without the slightest difficulty and without opposition from the Financial Adviser, while the scale of the appropriations would be such that the difference in price between British material and that of any other country would presumably not be of great importance, here is thus reason to hope that, if and when the present floating schemes crystallise, the Siamese authorities will turn away from the French to ourselves a result to which if it materialises, the visit of H.M.S. “Hermes” will have materially contributed. J 4. But, in any case, the process will take time. It might be facilitated if without any attempt to compete with the United States, where tuition is given free of charge, arrangements could be made for the training of a certain number of Siamese air cadets in England at strictly cost price. Perhaps this suggestion is worth the attention of the Air Ministry. If any offer of the kind is practicable, it should I consider, be made before the impression'of the visit of the “ Hermes ” has begun to fade. 5. As regards the form that the new Siamese air policy is likely to take, it must be remembered that the Government are thinking at least as much about civil as about military aviation. They are very much alive to the possibilities of aviation for passenger, commercial and postal purposes. And in this sphere their ambitions are by no means purely domestic; they look forward to the day when there will be air-mail connexion between Europe and Bangkok and thence to Indo-China. A recent article in the “ Bangkok Times ” (copies enclosed) is significant in this con nexion, as is the fact that the Director-General of the Air Force left for the west coast of Siam immediately after the visit of H.M.S. “Hermes,” obviously in order to inspect landing grounds. I conjecture that any decision that may be taken as to the re-equipment of the air force will involve the gradual turning over of the existing [440 aa—4]fighting machines to civilian purposes as new and up-to-date military machines are - acqumed^ gatigfaotory {eature of t h e visit, apart from its general effect in enhancing British prestige, was the unusual and expansive geniality displayed by the Prince of Nagor Svarga. This powerful and accomplished prince, for whose character and ability I have an increasing respect, has always been courteous and friendly but a certain stiffness of manner, due partly to shyness, partly to hi^ Prussian education, had made social relations with him uneasy. His reserve seemter to me to be thawing when the Governor of the Straits Settlements was here; it has now been replaced by a perceptible warmth. I mention this because there could be no more reliable indication of our real position in this country. 7. Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Governor of the Straits Settle ments and the Commander-in-chief, China Station. I have, &amp;c. « P XV A TP P I nw Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Bangkok Times’ of 1 hursday, March 15, 1928. In the Future. THERE exists in Indo-China a company whose business is to make a sur\e) of the possibilities of aviation for commercial and postal purposes in this part of the wor d —the Societe d’Etudes d’Aviation commerciale et postale en Indo-Chine et Extreme- Orient. It is a long name, but this country has every reason to wish it success. It the company’s proposals come to anything, Siam will share in the benefits, while it any practical outcome remains entirely in the air and never touches land, then there is no harm done. The company has submitted two projects to the Government o Indo-China, and very possibly to the Governments of Siam and Southern China too. Its main air line would connect Bangkok with Canton, by way of Korat, Thakhek, Vinh, Haiphong and Kwang Chow-wan. The secondary line would use planes ot lesser tonnage to connect Bangkok with Saigon by way of Battambong anc Pnompenh. After due study of these proposals, the Government of Indo-China has Granted the company a subsidy to enable it to work out the projects in the necessary detail. What the company really has in view is the time when there will be an air postal service between Bangkok and Europe, and there is complete confidence m Indo-China that the Siam posts and Siam’s national air service will secure that at the earliest practical moment. When Bangkok does secure an air connexion with Europe for its mails, the purely subsidiary lines proposed by the company with the long name will become a necessity. Meantime the company has sent to the Chambers of Commerce in Indo-China'a questionnaire and some details of its proposals. It suggests a service twice a week, Canton to Europe, in eight days, a surtax of 1 dollar on letters, and passage money, 1,000 dollars, with 40 kilog. of luggage free- pro posals which strike one as being somewhat still in the air. For the local service the passage rates would be 230 dollars from Bangkok to Canton, 150 dollars from Bangkok to Haiphong, and 100 dollars from Bangkok to Saigon, with 20 kilog. of luggage free, and a surtax of 10 cents on letters. In reply to the questionnaire, the Hanoi Chamber found the above tariff acceptable, but shrewdly asked what subsidy the company required in addition. As to the latter point, one French paper asks why the Indo-Chinese budget should be burdened to enable the British and Chinese to get a better postal service. The Chambers of Commerce are also being asked if, in the absence of any connexion with Europe, the proposed local lines are likely to give any adequate return. Very prudently, the Hanoi Chamber did not reply to that question, and it may be left here. The local lines are hardly a sound commercial proposition yet.In iny further communication on this subject, please quote ^o.

April 19'1. Dear Seymour:- I hrve been carefully coneldering your official letter of tne 12th. J&amp;nunry end your privrtc letter to me of uie 20th. January on the subject of the possibility of establishing an Aerial 'Aail Service between Siam and Penang or Singapore. I should of course be only too glad to give xh'j suppox*t to any proposal that vould improve ooTamuniCBtions between Sir.n rni Europe as regards the HangkoV and Penang part of the journey, or to any undert/king which would improve 9 trade relations between Siam and this country. Generally speaking 1 rm also most anxious to further the feeling of friendliness end co-operation that sc happily exists at present between Siam and British Velaya. It would, however, rpoeer to be open to doubt whether the present need for an Aerial Hail Service between Bangkok and Penang or Bangkok and Singapore would justify the establishment of a regulf r service; this doubt ia strengthened by consideration of the existing Railway hril Service between Bangkok and Penang. Thio Service runs only three times a week and there are no night trains, with the result that the journey takes three days and two nights which have to be spent by passengers at rrilwcy rest houses. I think it may rightly be assumed that when e better railway service is demanded by the public this journey will be reduced to one of 3b hours, and that until suen k fsst mail service by r* il is required by the public and esteblijhed, a demand for the service of an Aerial Kail Cfnnot be vrert.I Yipyb no doubt thf t in the course of time reri&amp;l development on the lines suggested by you must t ke plnce; at present, however, in view of whet 1 hnve seid above as to the probable present demand for such a service and also becrus* our present financial situation could not possibly Justify us in voting money for a political rather than a practical need, I think you will rgree with me that I could not possibly esk the Government of the Straits Settlements or Federated Malay States to take action on the lines suggested by you, I think that my view cm be more easily set out in p private letter to you, and 1 do not therefore propose to send rn official reply to your official letter of Jfnuaiy the Ihth.

COES’IDBH2I.AI. 4 ’•'7 i |j , | i B iV II G E 0 K, i r-, o f v 11th January, 1921 My lord:- I have the honour to report that Prinoe Devawongse informed me yesterday that the Chief of the Army Staff Prince Hakawn Sawan had recently been approached by the Prench Military Attache Major Desgruelles vdth a proposal for the establishment of a regular mail service by aeroplane between Bangkok and Saigon. As a result of the conversations which had taken place it had been decided in principle that such a service should be established and that Siamese machines should perform the requisite flights between Bangkok and Battambong 'while the service between the latter town and Saigon should be carried out by French aeroplanes. Phe French had originally suggested through flights between Saigon and Bangkok but the Siamese had demurred to this on the score of the inadequacy of their Aviation Service for the perfor mance of such prolonged journeys. It had not yet been decided when the Service would be inaugurated but it would probably in the first instance at all events be restricted to a weekly exchange of mails. put forward some similar proposals for the establishment of an exchange of mails by air between Bangkok and Rangoon or Bangkok and Singapore. He could assure me that any such Prince Devawongse said he was informing me of what * had been arranged as he thought it possible we might wish to proposals/ Phe Right Honourable, Earl Gurzon of Zedleston, X.G-. , G.C.S.I., etc. , etc. , etc. ,proposals would be examined by the Siamese Government with the utmost care and goodwill. In thanking His Hoyal Highness for his courtesy in making this communication I assured him that I should lose no time in reporting his words to Your Lordship and also to the | Governments of Burma and Singapore, so that I might be in a position to inform him whether, on our side, the estaolish- ment of aerial communication between Siam and adjacent British territory was considered possible and, if so, in what manner it could in our opinion best be effected. If, as the result of these enquiries it became possible to put forv/ard any specific proposals I Knew that the good-will and effective cooperation of the Siamese Government could be relied upon with a view to securing their realization. As very little business is transacted between Bangkok and Saigon it may be assumed that the new air mail service will not supply any real want and that its regular maintenance is likely to prove a considerable burden both to the Siamese Government and the French Colonial Authorities. Its inception arises from the French policy of seeking to improve the communications between Indo-China and Siam as a means of propaganda and without regard to the real commercial and economic requirements of the two countries. In my opinion the v/isdom of this policy is doubtful as from past experience the Siamese are prone to become easily suspicious of the political motives which may underlie any suggestions coming from their Eastern neighbours for bringing the two countries into closer touch with one another. However this may be, I venture to point out that, if it is considered desirable and feasible to aim at the establishment/establishment of aerial communication between Bangkok on the one hand and Rangoon and Singapore on the other, the moment for taking the question up with the Siamese Government is favourable. If the establishment of a service of this nature is not considered practicable I would suggest that the Govern ments of Burma and Singapore may wish to make proposals for the improvement of existing communications as a set-off against the inauguration of an aerial mail service between Bangkok and Saigon. Copies of this Despatch are being forv/arded to the I Governments of India, Burma and Singapore. I have the honour, etc., (Signed. ) Richard Seymour.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000216_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1996</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000216</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1996</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/42 Aviation in Siam</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1921/1940</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T23:32:15</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (153 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 154; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence regarding the development of civil and military aviation in Siam [Thailand]. This includes intelligence on purchases of aircraft and weaponry from the United States for the Siamese Air Force (Siamese Royal Air Force from 1937); the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence surrounding proposals to supply Siam with British aircraft. The correspondence also documents a visit by HMS
                           Hermesto Bangkok in 1929, and a visit by Siamese pilots to India in January 1930. The documentation for the latter visit also includes a report on the forced landing of one of the planes, and the fatality of Lieutenant Colonel Luang Neramitr Baijayont. The correspondence is almost entirely from either HM Minister or HM Chargé d'affairs at Bangkok and addressed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. This correspondence is then forwarded by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Under-Secretary of State for India; very little correspondence in the file is directly addressed to the India Office.The file also contains details of aerodrome, landing grounds, and aircraft radio stations in Siam, compiled 12 July 1937 by the British Legation in Bagkok: see folios 21-38. Extracts from a number of local publications, and a limited amount of correspondence with representatives of the Siamese Foreign Ministery, have been included as enclosures to the correspondence.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Thai Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Thailand</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Thailand</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Siam</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000216#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
