Kajor Hickinbotham’s letter of 21st Larch, 1945, T/hich \vill be fdftnd below contains some interesting remarks aid criticisms of the Bahrein State budget. Bahrein, of course, depends very largely for its revenue on oil royalties. (They account for 27 lakhs out of the total estimated receipts of 2+8 lakhs for 1945. ) It is clear that Bahrein financial policy recently has been much too cautious and conservative at the expense of the proper development of the Islands. It has been based on calculations made in 1937 on an estimate that the oilfields would only have a life of 15 years. I do not know whether this was in fact anything more than a guess and there have been no indications of which we are aware that the oilfields are reachirg the end of their life- Oil has recently been produced at the rate of a little less than a million tons a year, and this figure, of course, depends primarily on the drilling and refining facilities that axe in existence at Bahrein.

I regret tnat my other preoccupations prevent me from giving tne attention to Banrain affairs ttxat T snould wish, but it nas'become clear to me tnat tne attitude of tne Financial Adviser, . r.

Ke is still f to my mind, guided by nis recollection of his early years in Banrain wnen tne most rigid economy was essential and ne has failed to adapt himself to tne era of abounding prosperity in wnicn ne now finds himself* I was surprised to find, for example, tnat wnen tne last heavy ra^ns occurred in Banrain all tne roads of the Capital became impassable, and still more surprised to see in nis own annual report that per sons nan died of starvation in a State with nearly a half a million pounds in the bank* T recommend, therefore, tnat tne Political Agent's recommend at * ons snould be accepted in principle, ana tnat ne should be requested to initiate a more forv»ai*d policy in tne Banrain State. Since the ■ actual details will depend to some extent upon the materials avai lable and tne presence otherwise in Banrain of the Financial ' Aavieer and the Director of Customs a considerable degree of j flexibility will be necessary* I nave tne honour to be.

Hickinbotham, GTE.,uBN., Political Agent, Banrain to tne Hon'ble the Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf, Busnire* I nave tne honour to enclose a copy of tne Banrain State Budget for tne year 1354 A.H. which corresponds to 1945 A.D. and a brief note on tne aforesaid budget by tne Adviser to tne Banrain Government. It would seem tnat trie Auviser nas budgeted simply ana solelv to save a certain sum of money and nas made his estimates accord ugly Witnout due regard to tne urgent needs of the State and the J necessity for forward planning to meet post war conditions. The budget is an uninspiring document* Tne •note'’ wnich is correctly describee as orief throws but little light on the reasons for tne reduction in tne estimates and for tne increase/ ”increases forecast in tne expenditure* ./nat stands out above every- tning else is tne extra-ordinary fact tnat tne State has succeeaed in savi.iK tio less tnan Ks. 15,92,000 during tne otn year of tne/worl&lt; war and tnis in spite of very considerable increases in expenditure iU-tnost as astounding is tne Adviser's forecast for a saving of Es.10,00,000 on tne working of the present year* with tne sum vshich nas become available for transfer to tne reserve Fund as a result of last year’s credit balance tne amount now to tne credit of the Bahrain Government in British and Indian Government stock has reached tne satisfactory figure of Rs*1,01,18,947* T feel strongly tnat tne policy of saving at tne expense of tne well- bcinp of tne population and tne material progress of the .State which nas been followed in tne last tnree Banrain Government budgets is neitner reasonable hor correct* It is true that owing to war condi tions materials for building and otner purposes have not been avai lable, but unfortunately it is equally true tnat there is a tendency to cloak inertia with tne excuse tnat progress is impossible owing to war conditi oils* Not only can progress be made at tne present time but plans can be tnought out for post-war expansion and estimates can be worked out for improvements wnicn will be profitable to tne people and financially advantageous to tne State. Unfortunatdy T see no sign of any aesire on tne part of tne Banrain Government to imprcve- living a y id working condions~in tne country ratner tney incline more and more to tne unhealthy accumulati on of a large' reserve. Ch the 'Receipt' side of tne Budget the principal item is of course tne 'rtoyalty' from oil exported by the Banrain^Petroleum Company and T am in agreement with tne Atmser that tnere is no reason to suppose tnat tnere will be any diminution .in revenue froin tnis source i’ne Ndviser has budgeted for a decrease in customs receipts amounting to approximately h.4,80,000 on the grounds that it is probable that the price of commodities will fall during the present year with a corresponding reduction in tne amount of tax recoverable, and because certain payments were received in lo6b for goods wrich were in fact imported in 1362* Although it is not possible to judge the effect of tnis last item, as tne figures nave'’not been disclosed, ^ it is probable tnat tnere will be a falling off in revenue during the present year and tne Adviser is probably correctly cautious. I cannot agree tnat a reducti on of R3.23 .od 0 in tne receipts from 'Land Revenue* is reasohable. T should have been .inclined myself to nave estimated for at^least as much as was received in 1363 especially in view of tne Air developments which a^e known to the iidviser and to myself. The small reduction in tne 'Educati onal' receipts not in the least justified for with an increase in educ&amp;t’onai facilities in Bahrain^ in particular on tne female s^'oe, tne Adviser should expect to receive an increased return for trie outlay and the budget estimate for 1364 should be greater tnan the actuals for 1363. • I # consider the large reduction in tne estimate for thas year compared) with tne actuals for last year under 'Vehicle Taxes and Driving ' jj Licences' is not justified for the indications are that tne acti v^'t of tne Oil Company will be continued and tnat as seen as tne construction work of the refinery has ceased tne export of some 50,000 tons of surplus coke will be embarked upon and thus all available transport- will be employed* Nor is tnere any reason to suppose that new Bahrain passports will not be issued during tne present year with e consequent decrease in tne income from “Passport Receipts * 'Judicial Rweeipts' have been reduced by a considerable amount without, in my opinion, adequate reason, for it is impossible to forecast what civil suits will be instituted and estimates should normally be based on averages for previous years nor is it wise to indulge in tne annual wish that every body'will be better behaved in the new year and therefore the magistrates will not have to inflict suen neavy fines as tney d^d in tne old year. There would xxe be more chance of triis dream coming true if tne' judiciary would inflict larger and more adequate fines tnan is their present practice* I It/ .r i 5 It is trus that but even if the tne question of cige foils' proposal for a fixed monthly contribution put A Si ain lovert merit le re &lt;t ^14 6s.

Pages 22 to 26. however, contain a somewhat critical note by the Political Agent, Bahrein, dated 24th November 1943 on the Budget for 1362 (1943-44). The Budget for the year 1363 (1944-45) is on pages 7-8 and an explanatory note on it by the Adviser to the Bahrein Government on pages 9-15, together with separate Budgets for Public Health, Electrical Supply, Public Works and Education, pages 16 - 21. Revenue for the year I 363 is estimated at Rs.40 lakhs as against actual revenue during the previous year of Rs. 47 lakhs, and expenditure at Rs. 35&gt;30,000 as against Rs.33»29&gt;000, giving a balance of Rs. 4&gt;70,000 for investment in the Reserve Fund. The three chief sources of revenue are oil royalties (Rs. 262 f lakhs), customs (Rs. 8 ^ lakhs) — the increase in customs revenue being due to the rise in the price of imported goods and to revenue from food supplies and transit through Bahrein to other places in the Gulf - and income from the Reserve Fund (Rs.2^ lakhs). The estimate for expenditure is the highest recorded in the history of the State and over one-third of it will go in allowances to the Ruling Family! Mr. Belgrave points out, however, that salaries paid to Bahreinis living in Bahrein constitutes the chief item of expenditure and no large suns will leave the State for purchases from abroad. /The 29b 1000 5.31The comments of Major Hickinbotham, Political Agent to Bahrein, will be found on pages 2-6* He considers that the Budget is too. conservative, under estimating the revenue, over-estimating expenditure and making provision for several projects which are unlikely to be carried out during the period. He does not believe that customs and judicial receipts will fall while the present high price of imported goods continues, and makes the point that the Special Police who are employed solely on protective duties at the refinery and oilfields, might be regarded as a cantribution from the Bahrein G-overnment to His Majesty* s Government for the prosecution of the war. The Political Resident in his covering letter, page 1, agrees with Major Hickinbotham*s summing up, that the Budget though too conservative is, in fact, a very satisfactory one. The Government of India in acknowledging the Political Resident's letter (page 27) suggest that the Political Agent's comments on the Budgets for both 1362 and 1363 should be brought to the notice of the Bahrein Government.No.0/525• Politicsi Agency f Bahrain, the 23rd March 1944# From \ ■* f £ . /f j l Major T.

During the present financial year the Adviser has budgeted to receive Rs. 8,60,000, apparently anticipating a decrease on last year's actuals of Rs.5,36,500. As the import duty is levied on the value of the goods imported and not| on the quantity and as no reasonable person can expect any substantial decrease in prices during the coming twelve months, in fact everything indicates a further rise in prices, and as at the same time the quantity of imports has already decreased to what must be considered as the barest minimum it is reasonable to suppose that last year's actuals will be maintained. Therefore to budget for a 38% fall in revenue is unnecessarily cautious. (b) The budget caters for a reduction in the judicial revenue amounting to Rs.34,500 and the Adviser has stated in his explanatory note that this reduction will be due to a decrease in fines because he assumes that there will be a decrease in smuggling activities t.r o 10' and food control offences. I regret I cannot find myself in agreement with the Adviser on this point for in my opinion the greater the scarcity of material and the higher the prices in surrounding countries where price control has not been as successful as in Bahrain the more probable it is that smuggling will increase. Human nature being what it is and prices being what they are I do not for one moment believe that offences against food control regu lations will be any less in 1363 th^n they were in 1362. At the same time it is reasonable to assume that the efficiency of the police in bringing smugglers and profiteers to trial will not /deteriorateh 20. A * % ff deteriorate daring the coming year and that the judges will thus have the opportunity to maintain their high standard of fines, (c) School fees, item 6 (b) of the budget, are shown as being only Rs.4,300 during the year *hile the expenditure on education is Rs.2,64,000. These school fees are the only contribution towards non-teciinioal education paid by the people of Bahrain. 4. Expenditure There is of course a general rise in exDenditure which the Adviser has in my opinion rightly ascribed to increases in war allowances and other causes brought about by the unsettled state of the world in general. I find little to criticise outside the State Engineer's Department but I think it right to draw attention to the amount which the Bahrain Government c.$ p ft* i s paying for the Special Police. The role of the Special \ Police has been described in the Adviser's note which forms an enclosure to this letter but he has in no way stressed the fact that they should be considered at least in part as a contribution towards the cost of the war by the Government of Bahrain. It is true that they are employed in safeguarding the principal scarce of the State's revenue. It is equally true that oil is of vital importance and that if His Highness | had taken the line that he was in no way responsible for the war and that the liability for the guarding of the Refinery and Oil Field should therefore devolve on His Majesty's Government wo should have been faced with the unpleasant duty of either forcing the Shaikh to this expenditure or meeting it ourselves. I think it fair to consider at least half of this expenditure as a contribution from the Bahrain Government to His Majesty's Government for the prosecution of the war. 5* State Engineer's Department . C( (a) I still do not understand why the Shaikh Hamad Bridge /whichwhich appears to me to a public work and is in fact the principal public work in the Islands should be administered by the State Kngineer and not by the P*w.D« and I have been unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation of thle phenomenon. It would be surprising if it were in any other department to see that h e no depreciation has been charged cn the structure for the oast two from the Adviser why the Telephones Service, and the Air Conditioner! Service are consistently run at a loss. To budget for a loss when it is unnecessary is bad finance especially when the deficit can be expunged perfectly simply by increasing the charges to balance the expenditure* As it is at the moment people who are not sufficiently fortunate to own a telephone or an air conditioning unit subscribe to provide their more fortunate brethren with tele phones and the employees of the Bahrain Government, with air conditioners* 6* In conclusion I think a reasonable comment on the budget for 1363 is that the Adviser, although too conservative in outlook, a has prepared/satisfactory budget which is expected not only to cover expenditure but to produce what for the fifth year of the war must be considered as a very satisfactory surplus* (b) 1 have been unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation I have the honour to be, Dir, Your most obedient servant t me a tfijfco Political Agent, Bahrain*40 {Jo. - d~ I of ISM Office of the Adviser to the Ckyvermient t Bahrain Dated, Moharram 24 , 1363 January 20, 1944, From Co Dalrymplo Balgrare, Squire, C.BoK., Adriser to the Gorernment of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf* His 3ritannic Majesty’s political Agent, Bahrein* Sir, I have the honour to encloae, for your Infopaation, copies of the Budget of the &amp;tat* for the year 1363, together with a C?ua«aary of receipts and expenditure for 1362 and a note explaining the various items in the Budget* I n order to facilitate a comparison of actuals and estimates X have shown the revenue and expenditure figures for 1362 on the same sheet as the estimates for 1363.

Estimated expenditure for 1363 is Rs. 15,000/- which includes cost of a supply of new dry cells for which Rs.2000/- is included. An additional Rs. 1,000/- has been added to running expenses to cover higher cost of materials and extra repairs to old materi now in use. These have shown a loss during the last three years. As they form a part of the whole electric concern the loss can be set against the profit which is made from sale of energy. The account of A.C. Units was shown separately on the recommendatio; of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Committee which advised the Bahrein Government on the method of accounting in the Electric concern.

The actual expenditure was over Rs. 2 lakhs less than was estimated, and revenue about Rs. 4 lakhs more. This, however, includes two non-recurring receiptssSfepayment made by the Bail rain Petroleum Company on the signing of the new oil concession, and the sale of rice bought in 1358 as a war measure. t! Excluding these items, there was a drop. I of Rs. 2,39,238 (the figure of Rs. 3 .*22,734 given in paragraph 2 of the Political Agent 1 s letter seems to be a misreading of paragraph 2 of the Adviser’s note). This was due to a reduction in customs receipts and oil royalties. A sum of over Rs. l6|- lakhs was added to the reserve at the end of thnvear. A suggestion b„ the Sheikh thaTygfhis should be devoted to the relieving of 'want” among thenEmbers of the ruling family was quashed, and they are to receive Rs. 2 lakhs less during the current year than in the year 1338* Approximately half of the total expenditure for 1339 v;as paid^ to. the ruling family, o0;“*o y* j.' oil 'JJpne^h ird of the oil revenue. The cost of the administration was approximately /Rs.Rs. 7 laichs. Over Rs, 3 Isl&amp;is was spent on special public works, the chief of which wase the 1-anamahhullarraq. Bridge, nov/ completed, the Hospital, the reconditioning of the Lianamah-ft Port, and the building of the new 'Technical School workshop. •The estimates for 1360 are drawn up on the assumption that oil royalties will be further reduced owing to war conditions and lack of tanker transport, and that the reduction of the Oil Company’s activities will in turn affect the volume of import trade. Expenditure on public health and public protection is likely to be higher, and non-recurrent expenditure on such public works as the Hospital, the Technical School, and the proposed conversion of the buildings now housing the Customs clerks, is also included. The Political Agent suggests that the arrival of the Agricultural Expert from Egypt will necessitate increased expenditure on agriculture, and the new Principal of the Technical College may mean more money for education. The Reserve Fund, which now stands at Rs. 66-J- lakhs, is being built up to compensate for future diminutions in the oil royalties, and further assured income of Rs. lakhs ,c,1 before it can look forward to permanent financial security and the ability to carry on the administration on tile present scale when oil revenue begins to fail 1 '. the Adviser calculates that the State needs a H .

It will be seen from the Adviser’s letter No. 619-21 of .l 360, dated the 17th April 1941, that His Highness Shaikh Hamad had contemplated making further raids ofV tne public funds in order to relieve ,, want ,, amongst the al Khalifah. This difficulty nas been met and overcome and the al Khalifah will content tnemselves for tne coming year with the sums provided for in the bud_,et. I have considered at various times whether the amounts allotted to this Family should not be still further reduced but have come to the conclusion that it is not pScticable at present. At the time the present Ruler agreed to gi ve up two-thirds of tne oil Royal ities and retain only one- ihird for nimself it was considered tnat he was being extremely generous, and public opinion would not support us in any further attacks on the Privy purse* I have sown the seeds for an eventual reduction of the one-third to one-fifth, but the idea has made little headway so far and since the State has all the funds it requires the matter is not being pressed. 3. The electrically worked swing bridge connecting Manama with Muharraq will be opened to the public in four to five months time, and this striking public work will bring about a great improvement in communications. Substantial improvements in medical and educational facilities are being provided and the State is taking its full share in defence arrangements. * I CONFIDENTIAL .

Revenue in 1359 exceeded that of 1358 by Rs. 3.22.734/“• The 1359 receipts however included two abnormal items amounting to Rs. 5,61,972/- being the payment made by the Bahrain petroleum Company on singing tne oil concession over the additional area and tne price obtained by the government from the sale of rice which had been bought m 1358 as a special war measure. If tnese two items of abnormal revenue are not taken into consideration the revenue in 1359 was Rs. 43,39,527/- whicn is Rs.2,39,238/- less than the revenue during the previous year. Customs revenue was approximately lilakhs lower, oil royalty was approximately Rs. 83,000/- less and there was a decrease of approximately Rs. 48,000/- in land revenue.

P.T.0.P.T.0. The chief expenditure on special new works during the year was on tne Manamah-MuharraQ bridge and the government hospital. The bridge was expected to have been finished during the year but owing to the war it is not yet complete. The entire superstructure and machinery for opening the bridge was ready for shipment from England many months before the end of the year but owing to transport difficulties it failed to arrive. Three piers and the reinforced concrete dolphin were completed and much of the reinfor#eced concrete extension was built. The piles and about 30% of the deck of the dolphin were finished during the year. It is estimated that it will take about five months from the date of arrival of the material to complete the whole work. Local labour was .used in the construction work under the supervision of British foremen. Arab divers were s specially useful in fixing the central subrnarine.cassion. The women’s hospital was completed and opened on May 25, 1940 (Rabi althany 18, 1359) and the men's hospital was brought into use some months later. The ground* floor walls of the administrative building were built and the hospital, kitchen, male nurses’ quarters, walls, gates and # mess room were completed during the year. The administrative building will contain two operating theatres, X-Ray rooms, at stores, laboratory and offices. The two hospitals have a combined capacity of 100 beds but in case of emergency a considerably larger number of patients could be accommodated# The expenditure during the year on the women’s hospital was Rs 15,600/- find on the^ men’s hospital Rs 49,000/-. The expenditure on the administrative building, staff quarters, kitchens etc. was Ks 32,800/-. The total cost of the men’a hospital including electrict. water and sanitary installationa amounted to approximately Rs 1,32.000/-. The nurses’ quarters and the Lady Ifedical Officer’s flat and Matron’s flat cost approximately Rs 86,000/-. Approximately Rsl6,500/- was spent on the Manamah Fort. All the outer walls and tne four corner/^wards have now been rebuilt. The north east tower contains a large office on the first floor and a store on the g-ound flaor, this and the eastern will and the north eastern tower were built during the year. Additional latrines were made and the inside garden was fenced. Work was commenced, but not completed, on the new Technical School workshop. The building, which is 120’ x 40’ is adjacent to the existing Technical School and its dimensions are according to tne recommendations of Mr. GrJ£. Hutchings, Principal of the Baghdad Technical School, who visited Bahrain in order to advise the Government on technical education. The roof is carried on reinforced concrete beams supported by reinforced concrete pillars. Owing to the price of steel beams and the difficulty of obtaining them this method of construction ms adopted for the first time in Bahrain# The old building to ether with the new workshop will provide accommodation for about 100 boys. The amount spent on this building was Rs jl3, 000/-. Some improvements were made to the customs premises during the year including an office at the entrance to the pier and trolley lines and lighting on the pier extension. The cost of this was approximately Rs 10,000/-.BUDGJST - 1360 Publid lorka Deu T t » Hoapitale:- Sur^ery Block. 50,000 2.500 1.500 1,000 1,000 3,000 Incinerator. 500 Isolation Hospital (Septic Tank). 1.000 rgery Mortuary Kitchen.

Bahrain. Dated, R/Awal 21 t 1360 April 17, 1941. From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty 1 *! Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, . . . .(X P.T.0. 1 Si r I have t,he honour to forward for your information a copy of the budget for tne Bainrain State for the year 1360. It was not sent before because it has only now been approved and sijied by His His^ aeSB Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah ^ in a covering letter has stipulated that an adjustment in Surplus, which it was proposed to add to the Reserve Fund, to the^Civfl List in order to xclieve the want caused by the genera) rise in the cost of living among members or the ruling family. 2. Revenue has been estimated on a conservative basis. The estimated revenue is 10 lakhs less than tne amount estimated in the 1359 budget and 13 lakhs less tlian the actual revenue of that year. In 1359 there were two abnormal receipts. 4 lakhs was paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on the hew oil concession and Rs. 1.69.000/- vas ifceivea from the price of rice which was sold by uhe state to local merchants. Oil royalty is estimated at 25t lakhs. This payment is made twice yearly, the amount due for t»ne first payment is known and tne second instalment has been estimated at le^s than the first instalment. I consider that it would be unwise to assume a larger revenue from oil awing to the unsettled conditions and the lack of tanker transport. Customs revenue has been estimated at approximately Z lakhs less than in 1359. This is a conservative es lima to but the reduction of the activities of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, increased import trade through Kuwait and the amount of un- employment-in Bahrain affect the volume of tne import trade in Bahrain. Other sources of revenue do not differ greatly from last year. 3 # On tne expenditure side the Civil List and one third of the oil royalty which is paid to the Ruler amount to Rs. 12,90,000/-. “This figure is liable to vary according to the amount of the oil royalty. The cost of administration is approximately the same as in last year’s budget. 4. Expenditure on public health is higher than last year. It includes special anti-malaria work, quarantine services and provision for tne hospitals working at lull capacity throughout the year. In 1359 the hospitals were only in use during part of the year. 5 . Public ^protection includes the State police at full strength, the natur force and the new Special Police force which did not exist in 1359. The Special Police are provided with uniform and rations. _ ?ben the defence scheme was inaugurated the duties now carried out by the Special Police were undertaken by naturs who were not given rations or uniform. ? ni.c-i*/vu*vtr , —, . , 6 . Other recruitment expenditure on Education, Municipalities etc. does not differ to any extent from last year. A surplus of Rs . 6,09,000/- is anticipated which will be added to the Reserve Fund together with part of the surplus balance from 1359. Most of the non-recurrent expenditure on public works consists of completion of works already in hand such as surgery building m the hospital, tbe Manatnah-Iiuharraq bridge and' the new Technical School. Provision hai* been made for new married police quarters at the Fort and for making permanent the new drain from south east of Manamah to the sea. The building occupied by the customs clerks, behind the post office is in a dilapidated condition and it is proposed that tne ^-ound floor should be converted into shops and quarters b built on the first floor. At present the bulk of the state’s revenue is from the 6 *(C£&gt; oil royalty wJiich is likely io decrease uxid eventually cease/ It will be seen from tioe budet tioat revenue from oil is estimated 25i lakhs and otner revenue at,apurosamateiy 10 l^khs # Since the oil royalty be&amp;gn to coira in it has be*- 1 !! tlie object, of the state to ouild up a reserve which *ill provide an income in the future that ill compensate for the future dimini anting oil royalty. In this year's haiget the normal recurrent expenditure, deducting the third of the oil revenue,the contribution to the Reserve Rind, special public works and allowing 2 lakhs only for pub3.ic protection which might be considered adequate under normal peace time conditions, amounts to approximately 15£ lakhs.. The expenditure has been estimated on a liberal basis. Accordingly it would aooear that the state needs a further assured income of 5 ^ lakhs before it can look forward to permanent financial security and the ability to carry on the admin is tratics on the present scale when oil revenue begins to fail.

Abnormal receipts under Land Revenue ere explained in the Adviser’s letter. On the Expenditure aide the main items calling for comment are the following t- (a) Public Health The excess here of roughly Rs.llfOOO was largely due to anti-malarial measures taken in the second half of the year. The excess was foreseen in my letter referred to above and would have been greater but for the departure of the State t edical Officer before the close of the year. #b) Education There was a saving of rather more than Rs.l5 f 000. During the year Mr* Vallance visited the State to examine educational methods and necessities in Bahrain, and develop ment was wisely delayed pending the receipt and examination of his report. An unsatisfactory Inspector of Education was discharged and not replaced. The teinporary halt in expenditure and progress is however fully compensated during the current year. (c) Puhita ^rp.^Moa The great excess over the Budget figures here (roughly Rs.41,000) was mainly due to special defence measures taken on the outbreak of war and to the purchase of essential equiT*nent to put then into operation. This special equip ment was in addition to the rifles and ammunition for which Budget provision of Rs.30,750 had been made under the head Non-recurrent Expenditure - State Protection - Armaments. (d) King Ibn 3aud’e visit The expenditure of Rs. 28,000 on King Xbn Saud’s visit requires /-• 3 - (A requires no coniment except to note with some satisfaction that this visit involved the State f as apart from His Highness personally, in so little expenditure* (e) Coat, of Rice Hs. 1,36,000 was an item of unforeseen expenditure incurred at the outbreak of war when there was doubt whether foodstuffs would continue to reach Bahrain in normal volume* The State has however been able to sell this rice during the current year* (?) EuhUc, r.Qrt.B The variations between budget figures and actuals under the head Public &lt;*orks are, with one exception, fully explained in the Adviser’s notes* This exception relates to the cost of the Manaxnah Customs Pier Extension, which exceeded the estimate by close on Hs*34 f 000/-, due mainly to excessive subsidence and the need for providing a greater vAarf area than originally contemplated. The State Public Works Department has now gained seme experience in framing estimates and these should in future be rather more accu- 2 *ate. The main items on which expenditure was incurred but which had not been contemplated at the time of the budget were (a) the construction of a now rifle range, which was rendered necessary by the purchase of machine guns and (b) a Police ost, Jail and Tower on Jedda Island to provide for the better guarding of long term prisoners and for certain defence measures* 3* In commenting on the budget figures for the current year one must necessarily allow for the fact that budgeting \ in wartime may be rendered entirely nugatory by circumstan ces beyond local control* In the Bevenue Budget for in stance one would expeetthe Oil Royalty and Customs receipt figures to be exceeded if the war goes well, but it must be /- 4*.. 4 - P.Z. ’ 3586 be recognised that tanker shortage mo; p gravely affec k the former. Koughly 75 % of the oi3 oxp&lt; Nin .'U • '~Vv TU S' w^mX* 'j/ O &lt;^***' i ly^rw has hitherto been carried in Norwegian and Oanlah tanker8 f and at the moment the future of the tanker fleets of these two nations is obscure. Similarly an extension of hosti lities might gravely affect shipping In the Oulf and there by render the estimates under Customs totally illusory. y one may however express the oious hone that the item 'New Oil Concession - R3.4 f 00 f 000 w will nature this year. 4. On the 'Expenditure side, I make the following remarks on the assumption that there will bo no major interference with the normal administrative life of Bahrain. II. Administrative :-ewicen . The provision made here is likely to be in excess of requirements. Fcr instance if thi Air finistry perchance reach a decision on the suggestion to employ Captain Byard as Defence Officer the post of Assistant to the Adviser will become vacant and need not be refilled during the \wr$ it nay v/ell be unnecessary to fill certain vacant posts in the Custonn Deportment; while the provision under (c) 'Judicial, ’‘akfs and Mnors Departments' includes aseun of Rs.lOjOOO for recunerjition to a legal expert to covlify law in Bahrain, rnd this sues will, I believe, be found exc essi.ve * in. the provision here grertly exc44ds last year’s bucket partly because it allows for the staff required for the new hospital and partly on acco^jint of increased pro vision for anti-malarial measures. T think it is unlikely that the former will be required in full and I fear it will involve considerable effort to ensure that the latter is fully expended. IV. /-iv. In providing Hs.50 f 000 for special deforce meaeuree l.e. for a special police force to guard ths Oil Field and Refinery, the Adviser has not taken into account the reduction in strength which might will be naSe in the normal State Police and Katur strength. I have drawn hes attention to this and fry personal belief is that expenditure under this head should not exceed Ra. 3 lakhs, even allowing for the increased cost of rations in wartime* v. Education Sub-head (a) includes the Bahrain Government’s share of Mr. Vallance's pay and sub-head (b) provides for a very desirable expansion of the Technical School. I shall be reporting separately and more fully on the pro gress of education in Bahrain shortly. vi. PuaUiLj.^r.ka I have no oarticular remarks to make on the schediAle of public works though I feel bound to say that T shall be surprised if the full amount provided for hospital buildings is expended during the year. 5. It will be seen that the Budget allows for a surplus for investment of roughly Rs. 13 lakhs, which ordinarily 1 should describe as an inadequate investment, particularly in view of the expected receipt of Hs. 4 lakhs due on the completion of the Lease for the Unallotted Area and of the investment of only Hs* 10 lakhs last year. As will be seen from the remarks in fcy letter No.0/456 dated the 26th July 1939 under the head 'Investment in Reserve T? und rt I anticipated that a total of Rs. 18 lakhs might be invested last year* The expected receipt of Ra. 4 lakhs for t he Unallotted Area did not however accrue and the war coat Bahrain in one way or another roughly Ra. 53 lakhs. Consequently /-P.Z. 3536 Conaoquentily lact year* 9 invostnent df jsQ ^Qlokhlj was v— :- r ' a most proiseyrorthy addition to the Reserve• Th£&amp; year t provided oil shipments are maintained and orovided t&gt;!ere is no interference with customs receipts as the result of the war, I should anticipate the hevenue to be close on 4 lakho more than has been anticipated while Expenditure may well be from dc m 1 lakh to 3 lakhs less than the Budget figures* It is conceivable therefore that there may be Ka* IB or 10 lakhs for investment this year and this possibility will be borne in mind for discussion with the Adviser later in the year* I have the honour to be f Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. Weightman. Political Agent, Bahrain.iistiaated expenditure for 130b *&amp;s fis 31,41,000/-, actual expenditure was Es 36,75,000/-. ihe difference between actual and estimated expenditure is mainly owing to the following reasons. His Highness Shaikh Sir hamad gave h 4,00,000/- to the British Government towards the cost of the war. The Bahrain Government purchased a large supply of rice, half of which was sold auring the year. The value of the remainder at the end of the year was Rs 1,36,000/-. Although this sum is included in expenditure for 1358 it may be regarded as an item of revenue for 1359 and has been shown in the estimated revenue for that year. The expenditure on public protection was appro ximately 41,000/- more than the estimated cost. The oil royalty amounted to more than the anticipated sum and therefore the one third which was paid to iiis Highness*s Privy Purse s oore than was provided in the 1358 budget. In spite of heavy unexpected expenditure the deserve lund ms increased by Rs 10,00,000/-. allowances to the ituling Paaily. Rs 15,16,662. One third of the oil revenue paid direct to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad amounted to h 10,78,427/-, the remaining R* 4,38,235/- represents Civil List pay ments to the Huling Family.

Annual Report for the Arabic year 1357 (March 1938 - February 193S) Copy to The Bahrein Government’s Annual Report for the Arabic year 1357 at P.Z.4693/39 should be read in conjunction with the Political Agent’s letter to the Political Resident below. The Political Agent's letter and Mr. Belgrave's general review on page 1 of the Report give sufficiently detailed comments on the state of Bahrein's finances. It will be seen that these finances are most satisfactory. The total income for the year ±357 was Rs.48,11,605 compared with Rs.43,36,000 for the previous year. Oil royalties amounted to Rs.35,44,383 compared to Rs.31,65,235 for the previous year. The outw*fc for the future should not give cau:»e * for anxiety but at the same time attention is drawn to paragraph 5 of Political Agent's letter/ 29b 1000 5.31T r letter in which he states that the development of new industries is hecoming an urgent necessity. In view of Mr. Adrianas recent proposal for the establishment of a Gulf Unive-ge j ty in Bahrein the section on education in Bahrein is worth reading and especially that part which deals with the school (page 26) . The section on Political Unrest and Press Propaganda (page 29) may also he read in this context since it shows the part played by H Semi-educated Rulerg 1 * dissatisfied with labour conditions in creating ■unrest and the way in v/hich this unrest is fomented from abroad.

The provision of Re# 11 lakhs fo: this purpose la inadequate, particularly in a year when a Special/Special Receipt of T;e,4 f 00 t 000 /• Is expected as the result of Oil Concession Negotiations. Its Inadequacy Is partly due to l&amp;e heavy coat of the Budget to complete the Manama-itoherraq Causeway ( the Adviser* a figure for this le an underestimate) and partly to e^er-eoneervative estimation of Revenue. It Is true there is a balattce of Rs.3 lakhs fr&lt;Ma 1367 for Investment in the current yo r t v'hich brings the total anti cipated invectaa^nt to l a* 14 Irkha but, quite apart from thia t I an coi*v?cncM th«t the can nnd should invest Rs.16 lakhs I £t least during 136b.

From Political Aganoy f To H # Vieightman, Ksqulro f I*C«3 99 Political Agent, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political ^aidant in the Peraian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, 1 have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter Vo. 557*21 dated the 15th May 1938 received from the Adviaer to the Bahrain Government, together with a copy of the Bahrain State Budget for the year 1357. 2. In the absence of the report on last year's B^venue and Expenditure and the note on the activities of the various departments it is a little difficult to criticise the Budget in detail, but X make the following preliminary remarks, which will be subject to revision on receipt of the Adviser's annual report. 3. In the first place it will be observed that the Budget heada have been changed somewhat, and I think it la undoubt* edly a change for the better, since they serve to aet forth more clearly the different sources of income and the services and objects on which the income is expended. The totals on both sides of the Budget are almost fantastically in excess of previous figures due to the greet increase in receipts under Oil royalties, and to the consequent expansion of the public services. 4. So far as the main heads of the H*venue Budget are concerned, I have not much to say. I consider that the figure taken for Oil Royalty is quite considerably under estimated, since actual receipts from the last two half yearly/*yearly royalty payments hove ag gregated au 34 f 34 t 000A t and X should be surprised If the next payments showed a de cline • revenue under head II. Custo??* Receipts is estimated, some Is. 3,40*000 more than 1 b at year, but judging by the monthly average actuals for the first nine months of 1366 the eetimate of s* 10,00,000 is more than fully Justified. I venture to suggest that the figure taken under the heed Custom© Duty should be of particular interest to the Govern ment of India as indicating the existence of on expanding market in Bahrain, of which India might well take fuller advantage than it has done hitherto. dm The jbcoenditure Budget is obviously an expansion bud* get* V;ith the single exception of the figure under head Kb) Alloworxe to the (uling Family — Civil List, where there is an unexplained Increase of &amp;• 36,000 I see no cause to cri ticise any of the figures taken on the ground that they are too high. My only fear ia that the Public forks programme may not be completed within the 12 months, and were it not for tJr t apprehension I should have felt it my duty to ad vise the Bahrain Government to increase their budget allot ment under the head M C - HOADS - L'etalling of Hoads in Mans- mah*’ in the Schedule of Public H orka. I do not, however, exclude the possibility that in the course of the year pert of tiie Habile Works funds under the Schedule head 'A - NEW WCHKS - MAJOR' may be diverted to this particular sub-heed. The increased provision under major head II Admlnla- trativs Services reflects the increased activities of the Bahrain Government end is not in my opinion excessive for present requirements, though in duo course I anticipate that it should be possible to e ffeet some reduction under this head/-head when new services and departments reach equilibrium. similarly the figure under major head III Public Health includes s considerable sum for equipping the new hospital and consequently does not represent the true cost of the i/edical Deportment* 1 should anticipate that the ultimate recurring cost of this department will b e in the neighbourhood of Rs# 1,00,000, this being on the assumption that the anti-malarial measures now in prospect are suffi ciently successfbl to justify comparatively small future expenditure under this heed to maintain permanently the stand* ard of irununity which it is hoped will result from these mea sures. Tfnder major head VI Education there is a very large increase in the funds provided. I find it difficult at this stage to make any forecast of nomrJ. expenditure in future and I must content myself with observin' thrt Improvements in Education ars being financed on a generous scale. In regard to the provision under major head VIII Pub lic torks I need only say that the list of %orks detailed in the Schedule contains no single itsm which is not urgently ne cessary. This remark applies even to the first item of lie. 1,30,000 for a new Palace. As you are aware His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad has never been enamoured of the udhaibiyah Palace and there can be no doubt that very adequate use can be made of that building by the State if another palace is built more to the liking of the Shaikh. The programme of work listed for the current year is, I think, within the capa city of the existing Bahrain Government organisation, though there can be little doubt that in the near future it will be necessary to call in outside advice and assistance in dealing with the closely inter-related problems which must necessarily arise/- ■!*■'- 3 ' . „ ». .-^&gt;..--.1 ■ I I ru. —mmmm In regard to Irrigation (!•«• production of water) 9 control of water so used (i.e. anti-malarial measures) 9 and drainage both In urban and rural areas* The investigations so for mode by the Malarial and Agricultural Experts lent by the Government of India hove convinced me that the en gineering work to be done must be taken as a unified pro ject if the maximum advantages are to b e derived, and such a project would be beyond the resources of the Bahrain State Services* 6* In examining the Budget now presented in the light of «y Hole of the 22nd November 1937 in regard to the forma tion of a He serve Ihnd, J find that the programme postulated for that F*ind has been fully provided for* as is shown in the final paragraph of the Adviser's letter there is every reason to hope that the minimum mm of 'a* 14,00 f 000 to be placed to Reserve will be exceeded f and there is the more reason for this expectation in that 1 believe that the re ceipts anticipated in the Budget f*om Oil Royalties are much under-estimated* &lt;^n the other hand a sum In excess of the amount I had anticipated has been taken from Oil Hoyalty re ceipts for expenditure during the year* In considering the true State Budget for the year we should exclude on the Tie- venue side the followingi- (e) Oil Royalty ••* He. 30 f 00,000 (b) Oil Gauging Payments ••• He* 45,500 thus reducing the Revenue proper to Ha* 11,66,600.

In actual fact during the first month of 1357 the sum of Es 11,00,000/- was added to the Reserve Fund, increasing it to h 29,00,000/- and it can be reasonably assumed that before the end of the year the total contribution to the Reserve Fund will amount to considerably more than the &amp; 14,00,0d0/- which is anticipated in the Budget.

Besides tne humanitarian point or view or bettering tne lot of the people of Bahrain there is also tne political aspect.

This is more difficult, less spectacular, and slower in producing results, tn&amp;n would oe tne opposite policy oi administering, or partially administering, tne State ourselves, but in tne long run it will nave a more enduring effect* In otner words, as you will see, my personal predilec tions are strongly for ‘indirect* ratner tnan ‘direct* rule.

To come down to details, Stewart will doubtless lixe to icnow in brief wnat steps are being taxen in tne direction I indicated in our conversation* Administration* In tne first place in order to relieve Belgrave of a pletnora of petty details, and leave nim free /I2S “1 - 2 - free for •planning 1 , 3 subordinates nave been procured from India: First, a Factor, as ne would be called in Scotland, or Bailiff, to looic after tne SnaUcn’s private property and accounts wnlcn up to now Belgrade nas nad to deal witn« Second, a Treasury Officer, witn tne local title oi Accounts Ofi icer, to looF after tne details of finance, fnird, a Engineer* Belgrade tells me tnat tnese 3 subordinates nave already taken mucn detail off nis snoulders. While on tne subject of administration it is wortny of note tnat tne Banrain (iovernment nave, at Belgrave*s suggestion, in tne last few years adopted tne excellent practice of getting a Cnartered Accountant from Bagdad (wnere tnere is a good firm of Cnartered Accountants), to visit Bahrain to audit tneir f annual accounts. So far, somewnat to everyone^ surprise, no financial scandal nas been discovered, even in tne Municipalities, in wnicn institution all tne world over peculation and graft often flourisn. It is to be noped tnat tnie desirable state of affairs will continue, but in any case tne mere fact tnat all concerned know tnat sin annual audit will be made doubtless nas an excellent effect. Police . Law and order is of course a most important directly side of tne administrationtand tnougn we are not^esponsible for it nevertneless we nave to see tnat it is preserved. As you are aware tnere is a force of some 150 armed police in Banrain wno originally were mostly recruited from India but are now practically an Arabs. Some of tne jx.c.os. nave been sent to India for training and one or two Indian ^.C.Os. nave come to Banrain for tne purposes of training tne Corps. i'ne Police are quite a good body of men but tney need a Police Officer /\?]0 /p-v^ Jt /r**'/vJ+ J t h, lj* h h u *~ ^c^viv, -4- Qfficer to train tnem. At present Belgrade supervises tnan in addition to nis many otner duties. We nave arranged lor a Police Officer to be deputed from India to command tne Porce wiio will probably oe followed tjy an Indian Sub-Inspector. In addition to being Officer Commanding, Police, tne Officer will also ex-officio act as Assistant to Belgrave in wnatever # direction tne latter chooses© 6. At first signt it may appear tnat tne introduction of tne officials mentioned in tne preceding two paragrapns goes against what I nave said above as to tne advantages of tne •indirect* rule and of allowing tne Banrainis to manage tneir But own affairs. Rowing to tne increasing complexity of affairs in Banrain (tnere are already for instance traffic problems, witn a number of motor accidents a weeic i), it nas been necess ary to import tne officials in question since tnere are at present no Banrainis witn sufficient tecnnical Jmowledge to undertake tneir duties. I nave, nowever, in my conversations witn Weigntman and Belgrave empnasised tne fact tnat tne officials we bring in are so far as possible to act, not only as Executives (to use an American term), but also as Instructors. V~&gt; In particular tne police Ofl icer and nis Sub-Inspector will form a small police School for trainirg purposes. I hope tnat in time a certain young Snaikn of tne Ruling Pamily, wno nas already gone to India to be trained in a police Scnool, will be able to tape over tne command of tne Police Porce. law Courts . In connection witn tne administration of tne law tnere nave already been some changes in tne direction of appointing additional judges (on tne tneory tnat it is more difficult /173 5 difficult to bribe two Baarainijudges tJran one) f and of prepar ing a simple Criminal code# In otner directions tne following steps nave been ta£en# i r Public Mealtn # Some years ago before tne artesian wells, wnicn now exist in large numbers in Banrain, were made Banrain was fairly free from malaria# I’nere is now a good water supply, but witn tne water unfortunately nas come an increase of malaria, to cnecic tnis a vigorous anti-malaria campaign is essential and for tnis purpose tne Government of India nave been asiced to arrange that a malaria expert should pay a short visit to tne State# There, in consultation witn tne local authorities, ne will draw up a plan of campaign wnicn will then be put into force by tne Banrain Government# Tne Snaiicn is very anxious to start a hospital of nis cwn (there is already tne Agency hospital and Dispensary in charge of our Assistant Surgeon wnicn naturally cannot ,however, deal witn tne wnole of tne Bahrain population), and to nave a Medical Officer of nis own# This is an excellent idea and Rooney, our Residency Surgeon - naa assisted Belgrave in giving him nis expert advice# iiveigntman is also in correspondence witn a lively quarter in regard to tne Medical Officer, and tne Bahrain Government are intending to advertise for appli cants.

[INDIA OF^jOSFormbtion of a Reserve Funa for Bahrain I • Data» * The indications (a; Excluding the possibility, of new oil deposits at present are f• irly hopeful. being found at greater deptns than the present produc ing wells and of other aeposits in the Unallottea Area, we must first make a guess at the possible yield from the existing Bapco Field. Bapco people are v^ry chary of offering any estimate, but we have the following (i) A Ref inti ^. J.s already working, capable of dealing with roughly one million tons of oil per annum, ana it seems to be the general impression tnat it will be working for fully lo years. Actually the inaication are that more than one million tons of crude oil will pass through tne gdages tnis year, and consequently a million tons a year is probably a minimum figure. It is beleived that the Company has sunk £4 millions, and they would not have done that if they feared any possibility of an early ary-up. Thus allowing for a minimum yield of one million tons for Id years, royalty on Id million tons (allowing for deductions for local use) can be put at Hs 440 lakhs. (ii) In January 1937 Colonel Loch was told by Mr. Herron, President of Bapco, that the estimatea amount of oil available was 100,000,000 barrels. Incidentally he hinself estimated tne life of the field at Id to £0 years, confirming tne assumption made in (1) above. Again allowing for local use, we -/ might/ t * - 2 - might convert Mr. Herron*s figure into 1££ million tons paying royalty. Tnis again gives a rough total of 440 lakhs of rupees in royalty. U) (i) In the worst year I can find, Bahrain State income from all sources excluding oil amounted to Hs 0,71,000. We should, therefore, be safe in taking is lakhs as the worst probable income when oil closes down. (ii) Excluding special items of new expenditure (non-recurringj and His Highness* share of oil royalties, the current year : s expenditure oudget is roughly iis 10 lakhs. This budget was framec in the comfortable knowledge tnat there would be no snortage of money and is therefore not a **pinchea** budget. But expansion of Public Health, Agriculture and Education Departments - and probably Public V.orks (recurring) is inevitable and a normal expenditure budget should not be anticipated at less tnan &amp;1££ lakhs. This will allow for sometning to come and go on, but seems to me a fair figure. II. Deduction s&gt; (a) It follows from (b)(i) and (ii) above that Bahrain, to be on the safe side, requires an additional permanent income of a 6 lakhs per annum. (b) If Government stocks or otner guiit-eaged (trust) securities can be purcnased to yield 5% on capital, tne sum to be invested in order to produce an income of fis b lakhs is rougnly to 200 lakhs. Existing -/ investments-3- + Adviser confirms tnis figure. * fc Si lakhs on Adviser* s computation. investments xotal roughly its 13 lakhs leaving te lav 1-hchs to go. (c) The expected minimum total royalty is ito 440 lakhs, of which J goes to His Highness the Shaikh, leaving roughly Rs &amp;d3 lakhs for the State. Ill* Ouieii Uonsiuvratlins. A. It Is clear from tne aoov- that giv&lt; n freedom from war, premature failure of the oil field or other major calamity, the future of hahrain can be coafortaoly assured. But wo have not yet considered that portion of the royalties is requiied for current expenditure whii^ the Hes-rvo is being ouilt up. Though we might accept the figure in I (D)(li) aoove for normal recurr ing expenditure during this period - i.e. &amp; lakhs, we can safely take a better figure than that in l(h)(i) for Income. During the period now under consideration oil will be flowing and money will be easy In Bahrain. Consequently Customs receipts will be high, in fact pretty well whattuey are at present. I should estimate $ normal income from all sources excep t oil to average not + less than fo lakhs ( more probably fo 9 lakhs) per annum during this period. Thus, to meet the average expenditure budget of k 1££ lakhs, Bahrain must divert * &amp; 4 lc.khs annually from oil royalties. This is, as suggested above, probably more taantls actually necessary but could be regarded as an outside figure. B. It is clear enough tat heavy non-recurring expenditure must be contemplated in the next few years. -/ There isAlternatively &amp; oi l~khs and fc 3 lakhs* i.e. excluding His Higtmess* share. There is much to ao in improviiig Public Health (Sanitation Hospitals etc) Agriculture, Communications and Education. Not only is it right to spend freely on such services, but circumstances will drive the Bahrain Government to do so. There will be pressure both from outside ana from within, and th€safe course, which no doubt coincides with inclination, is to forestall criticism or agitation. It may take some time to work out programmes, but to begin with it would be as well to contemplate an annual expenditure for several years of &amp; lakhs on new schemes. Actually the figure may vary greatly from year to year, but I suggest this as a working figure. C. It follows then tafct while the Reserve is being created over a period of - say - Id years, the State will * * probably be charging an average of 3s 4 lakhs pxus fe 2£ lakhs against (i) oil royalties and (ii) interest on invested royalties (tae latter Deing an annually increas ing sum) . IV. stionft. I suggest tnerefore tnat, for the purpose of framing a programme, the following assumptions be drawn:- * 1. Total State receipt from Royalties over probable period of lb years ....... b 293 lakhs 2. Total sum required for investment h 187 lakhs 3. Total sum required to balance bhdget during 'building' period of Id years. fis 97$ lakhs( 133 ) 4. Total sum available from Royalties for expenditure during period in which Reserve is being created !to 10b lakhs b. Expected total interest in same period on investments (not including sum sum invested to end of last financial year as this is already taken into account in curi ent budget) - not less than Ii 40 lakhs 6. Balance (4 plus o minus 3) for unforeseen liabilities ana deficiencies - roughly fe 49 lakhs V. Final Remarks . It is unlikely that the flow of receipts from oil royalties will be a steady figure every year and the length of life of the field, apart from the guess work involved, clearly depends on the volume of oil extracted annually which in turn d- pends upon markets ana numerous other factors* Thus some adjustment will be necessary every year in the amount to be invested, but it seems clear that the figure to be aimed at are:«*- 1. Diversion of a maximum of &amp; b£ lakhs annually from royalties for^ current expenditure, until increas ing receipts from investments make it possible to effect a progressive reauction in tnis figure. 2. Investm nt of &amp; 14 lakhs annually as a minimum average figurer It may be difficult to reach this figure in the first year or two, but it should be exceeded by a progressively increasing sum thereafter as tneflo-w of interest accelerates* At this average the requisite reserve figure will be reached in just -/ over - — X * —over 13 yeara, tnus providing an aauitional factor of safety, 3. At a fairly early stage it might he considered whether say fe £0 lakhs or the surplus of &amp; 49 lakhs assumed in IV(dj above should not be anticipated and invested in agriculture (improvement and conservation of l«nd and water) in the definite expectation of - say a return. This might involve some small postpone ment of 'security investments' but not necessarily if oil production exceeds average in the early years, as appears probable. Even so,there should be a balance of h 29 lakhs which can be used for useful purposes such as macadamising all roads in Towns, and possibly all through the tv,o Islands. The above can, I think, be reasonably regarded as the most pessimistic possible forecast. The present oil field may v.ell be 100% more productive than assumed, ana deeper boring may also double production. But more optimistic forecasts should await events and for the time being there is as much money in sight as can oe comfortably handled. Sd. H. Weightman.

This can best be done by giving employment to Bahrein subjects on public works, such as road making, new buildings and schemes such as the ManamahJfctuharraq Hoad.

This is the twelfth Budget which I have had the honour of presenting. int, revenue. The income from the oil royalty has now super seded customs receipts as the chief source of revenue. In taking into account the revenue from oil 1 have included only the actual royalty due to the State from shipments already made until the end of 1355. The revenue from this source will undoubtedly be very much greater than the sum I have estimated. I have anticipated one lac more revenue from customs receipts than the amount which I expected inthe Budget for year 1^55 but thie figure is more than two lacs lees than the realised customs revenue for It can be assmied that the customs departaeut will more than fulfill ay expectations. I eoiae now to other sources of revenue . which together only total 60 f 0Q0/- in the Budget, actually last year over 1$ 30,000/- was collected from these sources but without increasing any of these taxes waich consist mostly of fees and licenses, it is unlikely that there will be any considerable change under these headings, except from the interest on the Reserve whicn I hope to be able to increase. I am confident that if it was necessary more revenue could be obtained from several of the earning depert inents such as the Land, inssport and Judicial depart ments where the fees and cuarges now levied are very low in comparison to similar institutions elsewhere, but though the country is much more prosperous than it was a year or two ago I do not think it would be reasonable to increase any fora of taxation. The total estimated revenue is • 22,lG,0Qu/- this is about eight lacs sore than the most prosperous year in the history of Bahraini finances when the pearl industry was flourishing before the years of depression. 3. Mpenaitufe. The expenditure is divided into two parts, recurrent expenditure, which is the cost of adminis tering and protecting the country and maintaining the Ruling Family and special rrojeots which includes uhe new -—-3- tke new kospit&amp;l, the proposed new palace and tarious projects soiae of wkiah k&amp;ve already been comaenoed. The largest itea of expenditure is h 9,20,000/- wnich is the Civil List and the one third of the total oil revenue which is paid to the Privy Purse of the rtular* The last item varies according to the aaount of royalty ana as I have stated the royalty will certainly be auch aore than the amount I have estimated. The expenditure on Government Oepartnents, Protection, Medical, Public Works etc. has been assessed at slightly more than in the last Budget in order to cover expansion in certain directions and certain proposed increases in the Government staff. The total recurrent expenditure, includ ing the Civil List but not inducing l/3r&amp; royalty is only half a lac more than tne actual revenue in 1255 from all sources other than oil revenue. Assuming that the non oil revenue for lo56 is not less than during 1355 it is evident that the State could be administered, as it is now, without the oil revenue. I can count upon there being s surplus of three and a half lacs at the end of the year and I am confident that this surplus will be greatly in excess of my expectation. 4. deserve Tuna. At the end of year 1355 the Reserve iund was increased from two lacs to four lacs. At tne beginning of 1356 the State had a balance of &amp;(/st) -4- of ^ 4 f 79 t Q00/- in addition to tke four lacs lie serve Ituid# Out of tais balance 4 f ll t 752/* (^30,000/-) kas been invested in 3ftBritish &lt;ar Ix)an which increases the Reserve iUnd to approxi mately ^ 8 t l£,000/-. 5. IjQtes on UjO revenue . Customs x*evenue was % &gt; 1,83,000/- more than daring previous year* ?he satisfactory increase reflects the improved condition of trade in Bahrain which is mainly due to the oil industry* During part of the year as many as 5,000 labourers were in the employment of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and most of their earnings were spent in the Bahrain bazaars* The influx of Europeans and highly paid Asiatics has stimulated the import of highly priced luxury articles such as photographic material etc* etc* The revenue from liquor alone during the year amounted to h 14,841/-. The oil royalty was over a lac more than dur ing the previous year* The remaining sources of revenue show no noticeable change except a large increase under motor taxes which is due to the number of vehicles and drivers employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The actual revenue during 1355 exceeded the estimate in the Budget by seven lacs, this was because the customs receipts and oil royalty consioerably exceeded my expectations* Dotes on 1335 expenditure * The normal recurrent expenditure during 1355 which is the cost of administering and protecting the country and providing the Civil List was appro-approximately ^ 9,22,000/- sligiitly less tJaan tke sum allowed for this purpose in the Bucket for 1^55. In addition to this ^ 58,000/- was spent on the visit of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad to England, this expenditure was not provided for in tne jud^ei as when the budget was made the visit had not been definitely decided upon. The expenditure of : r 1,54,000/- was pro vided for in the Sup pie sent ary Budget for 1355, but actually h 2,33,000/- was spent. The pro bability of this further expenditure under this heading was envisaged in my report on the Budget for 1355, page 5, paragraph one. Of this amount ^ 56,000/- was spent on the new customs house and enlarging the pier space, ^ 88, 00/- was spent on completing the anameh - Maharaq road upto the channel including a certain amowu of filling in trio channel, s 15,000/- was spent on road construction including tfte new Hanaaah - Budeya road, and 49,000/- was spent on building shops on government land in the bazaar, on two new dispensaries, a barrack room at the Fort, a wall round Maraaah Palace, reclamation of the sewer in liedd and various smaller buildings, repairs and extensions. The cost of the Public lorks Depart ment establish lent was P; 12,900/-. Filling pits at the back of ianaoah, which during part of the year collect stagnant water and breed mcuquitoes cost Rs 7,000/-. 6. almost all the none/ expended during the year with the exception of the visit to ungland has been spent locally and undoubtedly nost of it has —Tii - 6 - kas been circulated by tke earners in the baraar benefiting shopkeepers and merchants and stimulating trade. This is especially true in the case of money spent on the Manamh £uharraq road which is the cost of stones purchased from the owners of smell boats. This work provided employment for numbers of men, during the months when there was no diving, who would otherwise have been unemployed. 7. In ay opinion it is incumbent on the State to share the money which it is getting from oil with the people of the country, this can beat be done by giving employment to Bahrain subjects on public works such as road making, new buildings and schemes such as the isanaraah - Muharraq road. I think this is a more satisfactory and direct method of benefiting the public, especially the people of the country, than by reducing taxation. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Cloveronent.p. ^ LtJi 'X N0.F.434-N/36.

Dated, K/Awal, 2, 1355 May 22, 1936 To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. I have the honour to forward for your information the Budget for the State of Bahrain for the year 1355 and a report on the revenue and expenditure during 1354. This is the eleventh Budget which I have had the honour to present. The annual report on the adminis tration of Bahrain which normally accompanies the Budget is not yet complete. It will be forwarded at a later date. The Administration Report is written almost entirely by myself and I ovdng to pressure of work I have not been able to finish it. ] 2. The Budget . The expenditure shown in the Bud^t represents the recurrent expendi ture necessary for the normal protection, From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain Bahrain. Sir administration —■ H - 2 - administration and running of the State. The expenditure for 1255 is estimated at Bs 42,000/- more than the corresponding expenditure during 1354 owing to the restoration of outs and increased expenditure in certain services. The anticipated revenue from all sources other than oil royalty is not at present sufficient to cover the normal annual expenditure, fa 280,000/- oil royalty, is included in the Budget. In addi tion to the usual Budget a supplementary Budget has been made providing for the expenditure of fa 1,64,000/- from the surplus at the close of the year 1354 after transferring fa 2,OC|P0O/- (two lacs) to the Reserve Fund. Revenue . Customs receipts, s 6,00,000/-. idthough in the past financial year there has undoubtedly been an improvement in trade, yet the revenue from customs duties, boat and pearling licenses is estimated during the new year at not more than fa 6 , 00 , 000 /- which is fa 20 , 000 /- more than the amount shown under this heading in the 1354 Budget, and Bs 91,000/- less than the actual amount collected in 1354. Owing to the reduction in the B«i* duty and ths continued depression in the pearl traae which affects the yield from boat and pearl taxes, I have not con sidered it wise to assume that more than six lacs will be collected. Royalty on oil , fa 2,80,000/-. This sum represents the royalty due to the State on oil which has been shipped since the last payment of royalty by the Bahrain Petroleum Company until the end of the year 1354. It represents revenuerevenue froia oil for three months. Undoubtedly the royalty on oil will be greatly in excess of this figure. Only one payment will be joade by the company to the btate during the year 1355, the next payment is due in September and the following payment is due at the end of Inrch, probably after the end of the Arabic year 1355. The resnaining items of revenue which amount to Is 57,000/- do not call for any special comment, I have estimated the total revenue from these sources at a slightly higher figure than in the 1354 Budget. Payments to the Ruling Family. *in increase of ^ 44,000/- in the Civil List is owing to the restoration of the 12 i$ cut which was made in 1350. One third of the oil royalty is paid into the privy purse of the iiuler. The sum which will be received by him will be very much larger than the amount shown in the Budget. jtate iTotectioii . 1,40,000/-. This item includes the cost of maintaining the State Police Force, which has been increased during the last year and which is likely to be further increased during 1335, the naturs, prison adminis tration and the salaries of Amirs. The amount allocated to htate Protection is 15,000/- more than was budgeted last year. Government departments . Rs 1,58,000/-. This item is increased by approximately h 15,000/- more than was budgeted in 1354 owing to the restoration of the IG/w cut on the salaries4- of all Goyemment employees, provision for several additional magistrates and Kadis and a slight increase in the clerical staff. Liunicipalities. 's 50,000/-. The two municipal councils, l.anamah and Liuharraq, used each to receive a monthly subsidy of Rs 2,000/- from the Government. In 1350, owing to the need for urgent economy, these subsidies were reduced by r 50&gt;« Now that State finances have improved the subsidies have been restored to the original amount and in addition h 2,400/- has been provided for work in the town of Hedd. This money will be spent by the lluharraq Municipal Council in Hedd. Medical Services, ^ducatior;. Oontinrencies and public works . The allocation under these headings is approximately the same as in the last Budget. Medical services includes the State’s contributions to the pay of the Quarantine Medical Officer, the upkeep of the Muharraq dis pensary and the pay of the Indian doctor. Public works consists of upkeep and repairs to existing government buildings but it does not include any major new works. 3. i’he supplementary Butkei . ijiti Malarial measures . On completion of the financial year the Ltate had a surplus balance of Rs 4,75,000/- and a Reserve Fund of Fs 2,00,000/-. From the surplus balance Rs 2 , 00 , 000 /- was transferred to the Reserve Fund bringing it up to four lacs. From the remainder it is proposed to spend —5- Si l f 64 # 000/- on special projects and the remain ing % 1 , 11 , 000 /- will be set aside for unibr- seen expenditure or to be expended later in the year by another Supplementary Budget, The anti-malarial measures provided for in the Budget consist of draining and filling in areas containing stagnant mosquitoe breeding water* These measures are in addition to the spraying with oil which is now being carried out by the Police and Municipal authorities. The sewer at Head is a long filthy drain running throu^ the centre of the town which is probably the cause of much of the fever in that place. The channel, which is wide, will be filled in and made into a muon needed road. The two ponds, one north west of the Fort, the other near the Juma mosque at Jedhafs contain stagnant water which increases and diminishes according to the amount of rain. Last year the Manamah municipality, though very short of funds, spent 4,000/- in filling in some of the water pits south of the town. This year the Government can afford to assist the municipality in continuing* this useful work. The money spent on these schemes will all be spent locally on labour and stone. The muni cipalities will be asked by the Government to undertake most of this work. hedical . Until now the Government of Bahrain has spent comparatively little on medical work the bulk of which has been carried out by1 the American Medical Missionaries and the quarantine Medical Officer. There is a very strong feeling among the Arabs that the Bahrain Government should have its own hospital and medical staff. The question is under consi deration and when funds are available doubtless a Goveraiuent hospital will be started. In the meantime the Government proposes to open dis Govarnaeiit dispensary in L;uharraq f in various places in Bahrain. A dispensary for women and children is to be opened on the western quarter of Manaaah, on the edge of the town which it is hoped will be used not only by the people of Manamah but by the people from the near villages such as ..eni, Minj, etc. An Iraqi woman who has worked as a nurse in the Basrah hospital will be put in charge of this dispensary. A dispensary will be opened in hedd in a building which was acquired by the Government medical experience who has worked for the Govern- mont on previous occasions will be employed as a dispenser. A similar dispensary is to be opened at Bilad- al-Qjwlia, which is a fairly central position. The Government is advertising in India for a suitable man to carry out this work. It is proposed that he shall be provided with a oar to enable him to visit the neighbouring villages on certain days of the week. All the dispensaries and the medical pensaries, which will be run on the lines of the some years ago. A local Arab with considerable workers —7 workers will be under the supervision of the v u uarantine Medioal Officer. education . Two siaall country schools are to be opened, one at uitrail uM one at Burri. These sdiools will satisfy the deiaands of the hhias wno coniplain, with some justification, that while governaent schools have been estab lished in the towns which are mostly Sunni the educational needs of the Shia community have not been provided for. Only read in* writing and ei simple arithmetic will be tau^hVfin the country schools. Efforts are being mde to introduce technical instruction in the I anamah and Muharraq boys’ schools. There is today in Bahrain a great demand for carpenters and mechanics and if boys could ie&amp;rn work of this kind at the schools it would be of more practical use to them than the type of education which they are getting now. Provision has been made for the possibility of sending six more boys from the Government schools to Beyrout University. Public lorks . A new custom house including a flat for the customs Director is to be built on the shore opposite the open space facing the north end of the Barrett road. The present building is in a dangerous state of disrepair. Originally it was badly built on reclaimed ground and evi dently the foundations were not carried down to the bed rook. It has constantly been repaired with no permanent success. The offices are dark- 8 - and inconyenient and the buHdin^ is oversha dowed by the high new buildings which have sprun^^ up around it. The accomodation in the new build! nr for the public and the staff will be aliuost double that available in the old office. Barrack room . A second barrack room similar to the one which was made two years ago is to be built in the Fort. These two rooms vdll accomodate ail the men who are normally quartered there. The old rooms now occupied by the Police are in a bad state of repair. The main wall of the Fort, which is made of mud and stones frequently collapses and needs immediate attention. Palace wall . A wall is to be built in front of the Palace enclosing a large square on the north of the building, ornamental trees vdll be planted at the south west and south east comers flanking the building and there will be gates at the corners of the wall. By these means the approach to the palace will be improved and it will no longer present an appearance of isolated ugliness. Bhoc and office . A shop and an office are to be built on the corner of Prior road and Barrett road behind the present customs house. .•.anamuL dubarrau roaq . It is proposed that within the first half of the year this road will be completed as far as the deep channel. The amount allowed for completion of this work is more than will be required, the balance will be used in the beginning to fill in the channel, one of the advantagesadvantages of tkis scheme is that all the money is spent locally. 4. The revenue of Bahrain in 1354 has onoe again reached the level which it was ten years ago and not for a long time has the otate completed a year with sucn a satisfactory surplus. I thinK it can now be reasonably assumed that the lean years have passed and that a period of financial prosperity is beginning. Neither now nor at any time durin the anxious period of financial depression has this State incurred financial liabilities such as loans. In the time of prosperity a Reserve Fund was started and when in spite of all efforts and drastic economies the revenue was insufficient to cover the expendi ture the Reserve Fund was drawn upon in order to carry on the normal administration of the country. 5. The new prosperity is from the royalty on oil, without this royalty it would still be impossible to balance the Budget and to pay for the administration of the country. Oil is an uncertain factor and its production depends not only on the available supply but on the world markets. I consider that it is more essential now than it has ever been before to build up a really large reserve which besides providing a steady income will be available if for any reason the production of oil is restricted and the revenue from oil dwindles to the minimum royalty which is all- 10 - /“N is all that the Bahrain Petroleum Company are obliged under ail circumstances to pay to tne oiate• I have the honour to be, oir, Your most obeuiemi servanl, Adviser to the Government. hnclos:-Kotos on revenue 1354.

It is satisfactory that it has been possible to restore the cuts imposed in Bahrein as elsewhere during the world crisis, and it will no doubt be for consideration before long whether the Government of Bahrein should not be encouraged to expend some of their future profits on the improvement of social services in the Islands. It would, however, probably be rash to build too high hopes on the basis of the recent production of the Oil Company. If and when the Hasa Concession is producing commercial quantities of/ 3330 1000 12.34of oil, and if and when marketing arrangements have 'been made with the other oil Rings, it may well be that Bahrein will be restricted to an annual figure. At present they are probably producing up to the limit and hoping for the best. l a? v pOUTtCAL COMM'T-rW 18 Fib 1936iiritlea am ^onsulatt uen«raX 9 O . „ Jtiushlre, the 20th Jeoembe r .

Its finances have been administered with great skill and care for some years past by Mr. Eelgrave, the Financial Adviser to the Sheikh, and their present condition, especially when the long slump in the pearl trade is borne in mind, reflects.great credit on him. On points of detail arising out of the Political Agents covering letter or the Report itself, the following comments are offered: (a)/ 2730 1000 4.34has (a) Reduction of the Civil List . The reasons against pressing for a reduction at this stage given by the Political Agent are conclusive. (b) Appointment of an assistant to the Financial Adviser . Arrangements for this are well in train. Mr. Belgrave has recommended the appointment of a Mr. Luard at present employed by the A.P.O.C. at Tehran. The Government of India are understood to have given their approval, subject to a satisfactory report on Mr. Luard, and Colonel Loch who has received good v/ritten reports has taken advantage of his present visit to Tehran to interview Mr. Luard. The burden on the Adviser has for some time past been very heavy and the development of the oil field has added to it. The case for some relief is thus a strong one, and the financial condition of the State is sufficiently improved to make it possible to finance the addition. (c) Page 2, last paragraph . The Bahrein Petroleum Company have made one shipment of some 25,000 barrels of oil, but they show signs of going slow,for the moment, as regards further shipments. We have, however, negotiated an srrapg®aa±with them which, if confirmed by San Francisco, will result in a substantial increase in the minimum royalty figure payable and this will go some way towards safeguarding the financial condition of the State.

I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter No. 425, dated the 22nd April 1934, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, enclosing the budget estimates of the Bahrain State for the Arabic year 1353. 2. It was eventually found possible to balance the budget for the previous year. Moreover, a large sum of money has been realised from the sale of State land to His Majesty’s Government, from which the sum of Rs. 50,000 withdrawn last year from the State Reserve Fund is being replaced. In addition further revenue is expected from oil royalties. The financial position of the State is therefore satisfactory. 3. For this reason and for those mentioned in paragraph 6 of Colonel Loch’s letter I do not consider it judicious to press the Shaikh at present for a reduction in the Civil List. As the total revenue of the State increases the proportion absorb ed by the Civil List will automatically fall. Letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Honourable the Politi cal Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 425-8/9, dated the 22nd April 1934. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No. 20/S.F., dated the 4th Muharram 1353 (the 18th April 1934) from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government forwarding the Budget Estimates of the Bahrain Government for the year 1353 and the Administration Report for the year 1352. 2. The expenditure of the various Departments of the Administration has been reduced to the lowest possible level consistent with their continuing their activities. 3. No credit has been shown for the royalties on oil (which should become payable at some time between the 1st January and the 31st March 1935) or for the sums which have been received from the sale of Bahrain Government land to the British Government. These sums represent a large amount of money, but it was considered wise to omit them from the budget estimates lest they should give rise to attempts to incur new and unnecessary expenditure in the absence of the Adviser. The effect of the receipt of these sums will be :— («) to wipe out the deficit for which provision has been made, and (b) to provide a very large surplus. 4. The Adviser informs me that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad has agreed to replace from the proceeds of the sale of Bahrain Government lands the sum of Rs. 50,000 borrowed in 1352 from the Reserve Fund. 5. It will be important when the royalties begin to come in, to build up the reserve gradually to a substantial figure. G. I have not pressed for any reduction in the Civil List for various reasons. In the first place, proceedings have been going on for some time for the acqui sition of considerable areas of land for the use of His Majesty’s Government. To have alienated the Ruling Family, at this juncture, from the Ruler to his lowliest kinsman, would have been fatal to our end, which has actually been achieved with little or no friction. The same applies to a lesser degree to the Civil Air Agree ment. Moreover, the ill-feeling which such an action would have engendered, might well have adversely affected our negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar, as it would have been a vivid example of the internal interference which he fears. In the second place, a considerable sum is being paid for Bahrain Govern ment land, a fixed annual payment has been arranged for the Civil Aerodrome, and very much larger sums are likely to become payable in the present year from MC110FD a t^CLOSURC IN \ INDIA FOREIGN SEC*. FT ARY'8 ! Letter No 93 ! Deitec PI JUN.1934oil royalties. In these circumstances, there is not one of the Family who would not have resented our interference beyond measure and with, to them, perfect reason ; and the effect of their resentment would weaken our position along the Arab Littoral as well as in Bahrain itself. Finally, as revenue increases from the oil royalties and from the recovery (even though slow) of trade, the present high percentage of the Civil List to the revenue will be reduced. The Shaikh has himself suggested a distribution in the proportion of one-third to the Civil List and two-thirds to the Bahrain Government in the case of the oil royalties, and I hope that a convention will gradually grow up of a one-dhird—two-thirds division in the budget as a whole. It is well also to remember that the cost of the entertaining demanded by custom and of poor relief falls largely on the Ruler and his Family, and that the existence of a budget at all is a remarkable achievement in a Principality of the Arab Littoral. In all the circumstances I venture to think that it would be most inexpedient, and in view of the increase in resources unnecessary, to bring upon ourselves the odium, both in Bahrain and outside the Island, which would be entailed by touch ing the private purses of the Ruling Family. 7. I do not propose to offer c omment on the Report, which is interesting and useful, but would say that if and when regular funds become available from oil royalties, three matters should, I venture to think, receive urgent attention :— (i) the appointment of an Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment, (w) the institution of a carefully conducted campaign against malaria, and (in) the renewal of the Bahrain Government’s steps to assist and improve agriculture and fruit growing. Letter from the Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, to His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain, No. 20/S. F. of 1353, dated Maharam, 4, 1353 (April 19th, 1934.) I have the honour to submit for your information the State Budget for 1353 and the annual report and particulars of Revenue and Expenditure for 1352. This is the ninth budget which I have had the honour to prepare. The annual report is very brief. Many matters which should have been men tioned have been omitted. Owing to the fact that I am proceeding on leave in three days most of the report was prepared before the end of the year. I have had a great deal of additional work to complete during the last two months besides my ordinary duties, I have carried out the work which used to be done by the Assis tant Adviser and Commandant of Police and during most of the summer, while the Director of Customs was on leave, I have dealt with the customs work. It has been impossible for me to afford the necessary time to compile a full report. The 1353 Budget .—Owing to unexpected revenue from the Bahrain Petroleum Company and from the lease of the Muharraq aerodrome it has been possible to balance the budget by including the balance from 1352. I. Customs Receipts .—I have estimated the revenue from this department at the same figure which I estimated in last year’s budget though the actual receipts during 1352 amounted to approximately Rs. 6,09,000. It may be reasonably assumed that the revenue during the coming year will exceed the sum which I have anticipated. VI. Oil .—This sum includes eight instalments of Rs. 5,769 of which Rs. 30,000 is repayable from future royalties, according to the arrangement agreed upon between the Bahrain Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Al though it is practically certain that the oil company will commence shipping oil during the coming summer and that royalties will become payable to the Govern ment during 1353, yet I have not assumed, in making this budget, that any revenue from royalties will be received.» T 3 * VII. Le-xse of aerodromes .—Tliis includes the rent of Manamah aerodrome ^ and the rent of the Maharraq aerodrome for 1934-35 which I assume will be paid in advance in October 1934. Items VIII to XII are estimated according to the receipts from these sources during 1351, it is probable that they will produce the amounts which 1 have estimated. XIII. Interest on Reserve .—This is calculated on the assumption that the Reserve Fund will remain at the present figure which is Rs. 2,00,000. If, as is probable, the Reserve Fund is increased from certain sources there will be a corres ponding increase in the interest which it yields. XV. Loan recoverable.—'YMis represents the instalment of a loan made to the Muharraq Municipality to pay for their share of the capital in the Electric Scheme. Balance from 1352 .—The particulars of this balance can be seen in the state ment of revenue, etc. The balance includes £1,000 paid at the end of the year by the British Government for lease of the Muharraq aerodrome from October 1932 till October 1934. Expenditure .—The expenditure differs very slightly to the amount shown in the previous year. The allotment for the Secretariat is somewhat higher than in 1352 as it includes leave passages for the Adviser which are payable once in every four years. The total expenditure represents only the amount necessary for main taining the present administration and allows for no expansion in any direction. It will be noticed that the Civil List absorbs considerably more than half the total expenditure. The Bahrain State is not encumbered by any debts, the Electric Department however during the last two years has failed to pay its way and has borrowed from the Deposit account the sum of Rs. 15,000 approximately which if not paid off from future profits will become a liability for the government.

Revenue.'— actual revenue received during 1352 amounted to approxi mately Rs. 42,000 more than the revenue during 1351. Customs receipts showed an increase of approximately Ils. 8,000, This is explained in the Customs report, the increase is mainly due to the increased customs tariff which in the previous year had only existed for some months, Passport receipts show a falling off of about Rs. 1,000. Rents from government land and oil concession are greatly increased owing to payments by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and also the payment of the rent of Muharraq aerodrome. Interest on Reserve Fund has decreased owing to the withdrawal of Rs, 50,000 from the Reserve which previously yielded interest. The remaining revenue sources have yielded approximately the same amount as they did in 1351. Expenditure. —The total expenditure during 1352 was approximately Rs, 47,000 less than the expenditure in 1351. The chief saving was in the Civil List in which there is a difference of Rs. 24,600 owing to the death of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali and a reduction in the Civil List of 11,500 owing to the 2| per cent, cut and the death of certain persons who were included in it. Of the remaining items some show an increase but there is a saving on their total. The extra cost of State protection is owing to the fact that during the year the Police force has been brought up to strength and it was necessary to purchase some new uniforms and equipment to replace worn out material. The actual expenditure exceeded the actual revenue by approximately Rs. 4,060 although in the Budget for 1352 I expected a deficit of Rs. 60,000,7^; ! • 7 Comparison of 1352 Budget and actual Revenue and Expenditure. Revenue .-—When making the Budget for 1352, I estimated a deficit oi Rs. 90,000, fortunately owing mainly to unforeseen circumstances, my expectation was incorrect. Owing to the unsatisfactory trade prospects and depression in the pearl industry I estimated revenue from Customs, pearling licenses, etc., at Rs. 5,50,000 whereas the actual amount collected was Rs. 6,08,977, approximately Rs. 58,000 more than I expected. In several of the other items I overestimated the revenue. The debt of Mohomed bin Subah was not repaid and eventually the government took over his property in discharge of the balance. He owed Rs. 9,000, the property is woitli less than Rs. 1,000 but this individual is virtually bankrupt. Th order sanctioning a tax on artesian wells was unfortunately repealed b\ His Excellency Shaikh Hamad owing to protests of two or three leading merchants who owned several wells. The unexpected revenue from oil increased the heading of Rents of (govern ment Land ” from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 55,000. Expenditure .—On the expenditure side there is an increase of Rs. 5,000 approxi mately over the amount which I estimated. This is due to the costs of the auditor which were paid at the beginning of 1352 and which had not been allowed lor m the 1352 budget. Without considering the facts which I have explained in these notes it might very reasonably be considered that the discrepancies between my 1352 budget and the actual results are unreasonably great. When I made the Budget I considered that it would be dangerous to assume that more than the amount which 1 estimated would be obtained from the customs sources and I was not aware that an arrange ment would be made between the government and the Bahrain Petroleum om- pany by which the government would receive about Rs. 40,000 more than the annual rent.

They think, however, that steps should be taken to ensure that the amounts taken from reserve in past years equal to one year’s revenue before embarking upon diffusion of revenues received from royalties on oil. In this connection, they would urge that steps should be taken to give effect to a regular convention regarding the distribution of the proceeds of oil revenues. In order to secure replenishment of the reserve, I am to suggest that the Jhaikh's proposal should be slightly revised to allow e apportionment of 1/3 to the ruling family, 1/3 to State revenues and 1/3 to reserve.

Letter from the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, to H. B. M.’s Political Agent, Bahrain, No. b92-S. F., dated the 2Dth October 1933. I have the honour to enclose a statement of revenue and expenditure lor the six months ending with Jamadi-al-Thany which show the financial position of tne State at the end ol the first six months of the current year. 2. This year, as mentioned in my letter No. 17-S.F. of 29th April 1933, I was compelled to show a deficit on the revenue side of the Budget of Rs. 90,329, so far, however, during this first half year, the expenditure has not exceeded the revenue. .A t the end of the half year the State has a balance ol Rs. 4,868 and it has not yet been necessary to withdraw any money from the reserve Rs. 250,000 lor current expenditure. 3. In spite of this the position is not as satisfactory as it appears ; it would be incorrect to gauge the revenue for the second half of the year according to the receipts of the first six months. This year the revenue of the first six montl s has a somewhat fictitious value. It includes, under * Customs ’ pro ceeds the sum of Rs. 54,000 which was obtained from pearling licenses. Every pearling license has now been paid and during the next six months no further revenue will be Icrbhcoming from this source. Unfortunately the pearl season has been worse even than the preceding years, the bazaar is heavily overstocked with rice which was impoited by merchants who expected to sell it, as usual, at Ghuffaal. This year at Ghulaal, the end of the diving season, nobody has any ready money with which to buy rice and the mer chants’cannot afford to sell at long term credits. Until this very large stock is exhausted no more will be imported and customs on imported rice, which is the staple food of Bahrain, is the main source of customs revenue. 4. During the first half year, Customs receipts including pearling licenses, have averaged Rs. 56,000 per month. It is improbable that during the next six months customs proceeds will average more than Rs. 35,000 per month. Other sources of revenue, as shown on my returns, show a nett deficit of approximately Rs. 16,000 on the first half year, but the actual expenditure is Rs. 1,600 less than the estimated amount. The revenue from sources other than Customs will improve during the second half of the year as certain payments, such as the oil concession rent, are not due until during the second six months and this year it can be reasonably assumed that the State will receive an additional Rs. 20,000 from the rent for the mining lease and also rent for the aerodrome for which no payment has yet been received. It is probable that by the end of the year the total receipts other than customs may aggregate the amount which they were expected to produce. This being the case the total deficit at the end of the year will amount to peihaps slightly less than the Rs. 90,000 which I estimated. I do not wish to be unduly pessimistic but these are the 1 INUi Lettar NGUAUKh IN A FGIltiGN 3ECa^ PV, 8 1 N: O)2 conclusions which I have arrived at after carefully studying the available statistics and considering the probable developments during the remainder of this year. 5. The main source of the State’s revenue is tne customs receipts. Excluding boat and pearling licenses, which are included in the monthly ^ returns under “ Customs proceeds ”, the total receipts from the customs during the first-half year amount to only Rs. 20,500 more than the corres ponding six months of last year in spite of the very considerable increase in the rate of customs duty which is now 10 per cent, on certain imports which were previously charged only 5 per cent, ad vcdorem. According to Customs statistics for the first-half year I find that it the old rate of duty had been maintained the receipts from Customs duty would have amounted to Rs. 4,500 less than during the corresponding period of last year. This falling off is due to the following reasons. In order to show them I have made my calculations on the supposition that the old rates are still in existence. 6. (a) Steamers’ cargo shows a decrease of Rs. 7,000 due to direct transhipment of rice to mainland from steamers within port limits and slackness of trade in tea and loaf sugar. (b) Native craft duty shows increase of Rs. 4,500 owing to increased import of flour from Laq and tobacco from Batha. (&lt;?) Passengers baggage shows decrease of Rs. 1,900 the import by passengers from Persia of carpets and galims has decreased. (d) Export duty shows decrease of Rs. 800 due to direct export of dry dates from mainland to India by s. s. “ Pagervick ”. 7. One steamer, s. s. “ Fagervick ” went direct from India to the mainland and this one boat caused the Bahrain Customs to lose about Rs. 5,000 ol customs duty which it would otherwise have collected if the freight of the steamer had passed through Bahrain in the usual way. This is some indication of the probable effect of a monthly direct service between India and the mainland. 8. As after the first six months the State has a credit balance and the expenditure has not exceeded the income I think it is not a suitable time to suggest any change in the Civil List. I fully anticipate that after the next three months and at the end of the year the State will be faced with a heavy deficit, though perhaps slightly less than the deficit which I estimated in the Budget. If this is the case I consider that the Civil List should then be readjusted pioportionately to the decrease in the revenue as has frequently been suggested before.

Letter from the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, to H. B. M.’s Political Agent, Bahrain, No 1025-S. F., dated the 6th February 1934. I have the honour to forward particulars of the revenue and expenditure of the Bahrain State for the first nine months of the current Arabic year which ended on January 16, 1934. I regret the delay in forwarding these returns which is mainly owing to the recent holidays. The financial position is briefly as follows :— 9 months 1352. Rs. Revenue .......... 5,35,228 Expenditure 5,38,458 Deficit 3,230 2. In addition to the deficit shown above, bills amounting to approxi mately Rs. 3,000 were outstanding at the end of the month thus bringing the total deficit upto approximately Rs. 6,000, in spite of payments by the5 Bahrain Petroleum Company amounting to Rs. 21,541 (of which 10,000 was expected). If the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s payments had not materialised the State would have had a deficit ot Ks. 27,500 approximately at the end of the 1st nine months. A sum of Rs. 8,000 which was borrowed ^ast year from the deposit account, has not yet been repaid. 3. The following is a summary of the budget position at the end of the nine months— Revenue — Rs.

Expenditure has been reduced by approximately Rs. 43,000 allowing for the unpaid bills outstanding at tjge end of the ninth month of 1352. 5 To cover the expenditure for the remaining three months of 1352 at least Rs. 1,80,000 will be required. I consider that it is unlikely that the revenue tor this last quarter will exceed Rs. 1,30,000. Theiefore I have been compelled to withdraw the sum of Rs. 50,000 from the reserve in order to cover the expenditure for the remaining part of this year. I regret very much that circumstances have necessitated this course and I l 10 O pe that it will not be necessary to withdraw any further amounts for cut rent expenditure from the reserve which has now been reduced to two lacs only.

Demi-official letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, No. 1939-S., dated the 19th December 1933. With regard to Bahrain Finances. You will remember that when I discussed this matter with you and Belgrave, we tnought that the best line to follow was that which I had taken up with the Sultan of Muscat when I was Political Agent there and the State could not make ends meet. f j his line was to decide how much had to be saved in the Budget for the ensuing year, and then give the Ruler various suggested economies, the total of which came to more than the saving required. The Ruler could then, after discussion with his Notables, the Financial Adviser and the Political Agent, choose which particular economies to adopt. 2. It you see no objection, could you and Belgrave take a suitable opportunity of tackling the Shaikh on the above lines so as to have some sort , ! ot general plan ready when I next visit Babiam. The Shaikh and tne A1 Khalifah family will of course count considerably on the oil. The reply to that might be that when the Budget is being drawn up, the exact amount which the State will get from the oil will be still uncertain and that there fore economies for the next year will have to be made without too much regard to what oil will bring in. The Rs. 90,000 deficit, mentioned in Belgrave’s letter of the 29th October, will have to be met from the next Budget. 3. On a small point. Could you ask Belgrave in his financial reports to put in the corresponding English date to the Arabic months between which the financial year inns ? Enclosure 2. Demi-official letter from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, No. 222-S. of 1934, dated the 23rd February 1934. Please refer to your Printed Letters No. C./549-4/1 of the 30th Novem ber 1933 and G./81-4/1 of the 8th February 1934 and to my demi-official letter No. 1939-S. ot 19th December 1933 copy of which I am sending to Metcalfe. 2. The situation as revealed in the enclosures to your Printed Letters quoted above seems somewhat critical and gives us ample grounds for approaching the Shaikh seriously on the matter of his finances. If you have not already done so please take the action suggested in paragraph 2 of my demi-official letter of 19th December as soon as possible. In fact I do not think that it would be desirable for Belgrave to go on leave until some financial policy for the ensuing year is finally settled. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe.

Please see the minute at P.Z. 5467/32 on the previous annual report. The Financial Adviser’s Budget estimates for the Mohammedan year 1352 (1933/34) and his report for the year 1351 are printed at P.Z.7714/33. The report for 1351 (page 6) shows that the State again experienced a very bad year financially. Expenditure exceeded revenue by R8.93,672 and the State was faced with an actual deficit of Rs.69,132, after spending Rs.24,540 carried forward from the previous year, and iisdurulii^ The reserve fund of 3 lakhs^to 2i&gt; This deficit was almost entirely due to the very serious fall in customs receipts, which in turn was indirectly due to the continued depression in the pearl industry/ y . -industry, upon which a large proportion of the inhabitants depend for a living. An interesting report by the Director of Customs is at page 31. Owing to the strict patrol now maintained on the Persian Coast there was a marked decrease in customs receipts from sugar and tea which hitherto used to be imported into Bahrein and smuggled out again into Persia - a very lucrative proposition owing to the very high Persian duties. The Director of Customs gives a very interesting account of the origin of the trouble regarding the transit dues (pages 36 to 38). Mr.De Grenier does not believe that the Bahrein transit trade has much to fear in the long run from direct shipment from India to a mainland porV, but thinks that the trade may eventually be ruined by competition from Jeddah, Ib«—Sattd increase^/the import duty at -h4e Persian Gulf ports/ x to the same rate as those in force at Jeddah. There are also interesting passages in the Report on the Police Force, which seems to be shaping well, a»|jpage 1 , the death of Sheikh Bin Isa ^»^page 26^, and the Bahrein Electric Supply -e»-(page 2T). Turning to the Budget Estimates for 1352 (1933/34) it will be seen that Mr.Belgrave actually had to resort to budgetting for a deficit of Rs.90,000. In spite of the saving made in the Civil List as a result of Sheikh Isa’s death, the Civil List still absorbs 59.8# of the estimated revenue, and in spite of great efforts on Mr.Belgrave*s part he has not been able to reduce the allowances of the principal Sheikhs by more than 2i#. The Government of India, who took a very serious view of the situation when they received copies of Mr.Belgrave’s report, considered that unless figures for the first half of the financial year showed a probability that the Budget would balance, the financial/2119 5000 8.33 Minute Paper Department financial position should be explained to the Sheikh in unequivocal terms and a substantial reduction effected in his Civil List. The Government of India asked the Political Resident to advise how this could most effectively be done. Since theq however, the position has somewhat improved, and from the Political Resident's letter of 1st December, P.Z.213/34, it will be seen that the half year ended with a small surplus of Rs.4,000. Also, a satisfactory financial agreement has lately been made with the Bahrein Petroleum Company in connection with the extension of their prospecting license as a result of which an additional Rs . 318 , 850 will accrue to the State in the present financial year, and a larger increase of Rs.66,150 in 1934/5. This is in addition to the previous payment of Rs.10,000 per annum and to a sum of Rs.25,000 presented to the Sheikh’s private purse under the new agreement. The arrangement mentioned in paragraph 8 of the Political Resident's covering letter at P.Z.7714 for dividing oil revenue between the Sheikh and the administration does not seem to have been carried out in this case and the‘actual division is more favourable to the State. In view of the improvement in the position Colonel Powle who had already to discuss with the Sheikh the complications of the new oil agreement did not feel it expedient on his last visit to raise a second difficult financial problem by discussing a reduction in the civil list. The matter can be considered again when we see the position at the end of the present year 1352, which ends on 15th April. Mr. Belgrave expected to receive something from Imperial Airways during 1352 in respect of rent.

On my recent visit to Bahrain I discussed the matter with the Political Agent and the Financial Adviser, but did not make an approach to Shaikh Hamad for the following reasons. As will be gathered from correspondent ending with my Express Letter No.C/176,dated the 21st November 1933, my time at Bahrain, as that of Colonel Loch and Mr. Belgrave, was fully taken up - aided by His Majesty’s Government - in an endeavour, successful I am glad to say, to extract from the Bahrain Petroleum Company fair terms for the Bahrain Government in return for their sanction of an extension to the Company of the latter* s Prospecting License. Shaikh Hamad, who - as I have had occasion to remark before - is far from being a good man of business, proved on this occasion unexpectedly intelligent. I felt, however, that it would be trying him fx rather high to introduce a second important financial problem in the course of a single visit. Moreover the Bahrain financial half year had as a matter of fact ended with a small surplus of some Rs.4,000/-, which His Excellency would undoubtedly have quoted as a reason for'2Dlo| for delaying measures of economy, to say nothing of the further fact - which he also would have 'brought up - that hy our efforts we had induced the Bahrain Petroleum Company to add to the capital and income of the Bahrain State. I felt therefore, and Colonel Loch and Mr. Belgrave agreed with me, that the atmosphere was not suitable for pressing economies upon His Excellency. 3. I hope, however, to visit Bahrain again in another six weeks or so. By then Mr. Belgrave will have some idea of how the financial year is likely to end, and the time will - I think - he suitable for a serious talk with the Shaikh. I trust the Government of India approves of this course of action. I have, etc., Sd. T.C. Fowle, Lieut.Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. —cd r OpnfUential.

(3) t Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 958-S of 1993. dated the 4th August 1933. 1 have the honour to enclose a copy of the letters*, which give cover to a copy of the Budget for the Bahrain State for 1352 and to the Annual Report of the Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain for the year 1351. 2. I need not trouble the Government of India with a detailed com mentary, but would draw attention to certain important points. 3. It will be seen that in general the financial position is even worse than it was a year ago, inroads have again been made on the small reserve, and the State is faced with the possibility of the loss of the dues on the Tran- i sit Trade with Sa udi Arabia The pearl market has, it is true, shown a slight sign of recovery, but not sufficient for it to afford any relief to the distress among the pearling fraternity in Bahrain. There is little money in the Island and even men, till recently accounted rich, find it difficult to do more than exist. 4. The Government of Bahrain have faced the situation with com mendable resolution and have reduced the expenditure on the Administra tion to the barest necessities. It is impossible further to reduce the ex penditure without curtailing essential services. A reduction has, moreover, been effected in the Civil List, though it still absorbs an unduly high proportion of the revenues of the State. It will, however, be appreciated that for an Arab State to bring about an effective reduction in the allowances of the various branches of its Ruling Family is a remarkable achievement. 5. Some alleviation of the position has been given by the death of His Excellency the late Sir ’Isa bin Ali A1 Khalifah and of other members of the A1 Khalifah Family. The old and acknowledged custom of the A1 Khalifah that, when a member of the family dies, his allowance reverts to the Ruler, has been upheld, in spite of opposition, and a fair proportion of the allowances of those recently deceased has been allowed to lapse to the State. In another connection His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa A1 Kha lifah has proposed to institute a Family Majlis (Council) to advise him in such matters, and the idea has much to commend it. i 0. The tariff on certain articles of import has been raised, but it is too early to judge to what extent this will benefit the revenue. 7. Recently the Government of Bahrain employed an Auditor from a British firm of Auditors operating in ’Iraq and Abadan. The results of the audit were eminently satisfactory for the accounts of the various Departments of the State were found to be in order. The Auditor was, however, able to indicate a number of directions in which the method of keeping the accounts could be materially simplified. I venture to think that the Government of Bahrain is much to be congratulated, both on taking an actim so unprecedented on the Arab Littoral and on the ex cellent results. 8. I fear that the financial position, in Bahrain as elsewffiere, presents a gloomy picture, but it is hoped that the discovery of oil will place the finances of the State on a more satisfactory footing. Opportunities have been taken of putting into the mind of His Excellency Shaikh Hamadi the idea that it w r as desirable that the revenue obtained from oil should be *1.

His Excellency evidently brooded over this matter, for he has now himself suggested that a division should be made in the proportion of one-third to himself and two-thirds to the Administration. The matter has not yet been placed on a firm basis, as negotiations regarding the exploitation of the oil are still in progress, but the fact that His Excellency has himself made this suggestion, and has proposed so reasonable a proportion, may be regard ed as of happy augury. 9. In conclusion, I venture to make the warmest commendation of the work performed by the Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Mr. C. D. Belgrave. 1 have personal knowledge of the extraordinary difficulties with which Mr. Belgrave has been faced and of the tact and ability which he has displayed in dealing with them; for it is not an easy matter for a servant of the State to defend the revenue against the demands of a Ruler and Ruling Family, whose ideas in money matters are those of the open-handed Bedouin Chief. These’ difficulties have been rendered the more serious by the fact that tfie financial position of Bahrain is based, almost wholly, on a luxury trade, so that the financial depression has had a deep effect on all classes, i Though Mr. Belgrave is a servant of the Government of Bahrain, I trust that I may be authorised to convey to him, through His Excellency Shaikh Hamad, an expression of the high approval of the Government of Inc^i of the manner in which he has carried out his duties as Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government in circumstances of great difficulty. Such a message would, I think, be appreciated by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and would encourage Mr Belgrave in his arduous and responsible work. ; Enclosure 1 to Serial &gt;No. (3).

It has been approved and signed by H. E. Shaikh Hamad. This is the eighth Budget which I have had the honour of presenting. The annual report on Bahrain for 1351 will be despatched. ^ later, it usually accompanies the Budget, but as you required the Budget as early as possible, I am sending it now. i I he financial position of the State causes me very grave concern; both the new Budget and the figures for the last year reveal a very disastrous condition of a flairs and I should be obliged if you would communicate the contents of this letter to the Ilon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.. . Comparison 1350-1351.—The actual revenue during 1351 was Rs. 1,20,074 less than during 1350. This very serious falling off is almost entirely in Customs receipts. The bulk of imports has decreased greatly and the value of goods imported has also decreased. The people of Bahrain can no longer afford to buy anything except the cheapest commodities. Expenditure during 1351 exceeded the revenue by Rs. 93,672. Although the expenditure during 1351 was actually less than the amount allocated in the Budget, the revenue fell short of the estimated amount by Rs. 1,05.302. Briefly, at the end of 1351, the State was faced with an actual deficit of Rs. 69,132, having also spent the sum of Rs. 24,540 which was carried forward from the previous year. j The Reserve Fund at the beginning of 1351 was three lacs; at the end of 1351 it is only-Rs. 2,50,000. j3 This year, for the hist time since a budget has been made in Bahrain, I have had to show a deficit on the revenue side of the budget in order to. balance expenditure. It would have been possible, and this suggestion was urged by the Shaikhs during discussions on the subject, to estimate- the revenue at an amount much greater than could honestly be expected, in order to balance the budget. In my opinion it would be false finance and would serve no useful purpose. The deficit will be met from what remains of the ^ Reserve. Revenue .—In last year’s Budget, I estimated the revenue at Rs. 7,89,600. My estimate was incorrect, the actual revenue collected was Rs. 6.84,298 (excluding Rs. 12,447 which was transferred from the Police account to the Consolidated Fund). Customs receipts last year were estimated at Rs. 7,00,000, actually they only produced Rs. 6,00,684. Owing to the deplorable condition of the pearl industry the continued decrease in amount and value of imports and the probability, which is now almost a certainty, of Bahrain losing its R. E. trade, I consider that the most that can be expected from the customs this year is Rs. 5,50,000 which is lacs less than the estimated customs revenue for last year, but only Rs. 50,684 less than the actual customs receipts received during that year. The total amount expected from all other sources of revenue is estimated at slightly less than last year’s total. This amount has been arrived at after careful consideration of the actual receipts for 1351. I Rents of Government lands has been somewhat increased. This item includes the rent from the oil company (Rs. 10,000 per annum) and also rent of aerodrome. I have assumed that the long deferred payment by the Imperial Airways for the use of the aerodrome will materialise during the year. Interest on reserve has diminished; the rate of interest is now much lower than before and the capital has dwindled, j A new, but very small, source of revenue is the tax on artesian wells used solely for cultivation. , The amount owing by MohomedEin Subah, chief of the Bin-Aali, which was lent to him several years ago by the Government, is shown as a possible receipt, but I am extremely doubtful as to whether this loan will be repaid. Mohomed bin Subah has now induced the Ruler of Kuwait to intercede with H. E. Shaikh Hamad in connection with this debt. ) Should the Bahrain Petroleum Company enter into the mining lease in December 1933 an additional Rs. 20,000 will accrue to the State but as they have now applied for an extension of the Prospecting License I cannot assume that they will pay the extra amount. | Expenditure .—The expenditure in the new Budget has been reduced to Rs. 72,100 less than the estimated expenditure for the previous year. Owing to the death of the late Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali, a saving of Rs. 42,000 w 7 as effected. The monthly emolument which he was induced to accept in the year 1347 was Rs. 5,000 per month. After his death H. E. Shaikh Hamad was persuaded to agree to a monthly payment of Rs. 1,500 instead of Rs. 5,000 to be shared by Shaikh Sir tsa’s widow and various other relations. | j When the time arrived for making the new budget, H. E. Shaikh Hamad after discussing the matter, instructed me to explain the financial position to Shaikh Mohomed, Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman. After several long meetings during which the whole financial position was thoroughly reviewed, the Shaikhs were made to realise that some reduction should be made in the Civil List. Shaikh Abdullah had previously agreed, during informal conversations with me on the subject, that this step was inevitable and essential. Shaikh Salman appreciated the necessity after examining the figures, but Shaikh Mohomed was consistently opposed to any reduction whatever and was only induced to agree to it by his two relations4 after lengthy arguments. Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman were at first in clined to make a reduction of 5 per cent, or even 6 per cent, but the propor tion was eventually reduced to 2J per cent, which was the most that Shaikh Mohomed would consent to. &lt; 1 suggested that the Kuler’s own emolument should 1 not be reduced in view of the necessary expenses pertaining to his position; my suggestion was vehemently opposed by the three Shaikhs who declared that their finan cial obligations, as the three leading Shaikhs of the family, were equal to those of the Ruler. This opinion is one which cannot be maintained and it is not accepted by H. E. Shaikh Hamad. ! H. E. Shaikh Hamad, with great reluctance, accepted the suggestions, but at the end of the year, when the budget had actually been drafted, he wrote to me and pointed out that both the Hon’ble the Political Resident, and the Political Agent had assured him that his allowances should not be lurther diminished. In view of his letter when the budget was ready for his signature, 1 altered the figures and cancelled the reduction effected by the 2.j per cent, reduction on the amount received by H. E. Shaikh Hamad himself. Eventually the total saving by this 2J per cent, cut resulted in Rs. 6,000, but it must be admitted that the appreciation by the Shaikhs of the principle is of more lasting value than this negligible sum that has been saved. Economies have been made wherever possible in other directions. Edu cation has been reduced by 25 per cent., savings have been made in some of the departmental expenditure, and these reductions have been accom plished without materially affecting the essential activities of the State but the total amount allocated on the expenditure side, apart from the Civil List, is the very lowest sum with which the State can continue its present functions. ; It would endanger the state of Public Security to reduce the newly organised Police lorce, or the naturs; the sum allocated for medical services is very small in proportion to the needs of the public, in fact if money was available this is a department which more than any other deserves extension; the municipalities too, without their monthly grant of Rs. 1,000 each, which is exactly half the subsidy they used to receive some years ago, would not have sufficient funds to carry on the very useful work which they do to-day and which is perhaps one of the most conspicuous advertisements of the improved conditions existing now in Bahrain. j In spite of the amount which was saved owing to the death of late Shaikh Sir Isa and the 2?, per cent, reduction on the Civil List, the total sum required to meet the Civil List is Rs. 3.80,000 which is 59'8 per cent, of the estimated revenue and considerably over half the total annual expenditure. I have referred to this matter very frequently during the year when forwarding monthly accounts and it may appear that I am stressing the matter unreasonably, but as it is one of my duties to compose the oudget and to be responsible for the finances of this State I should be failing in mv duty if I did not take this opportunity of stating that it is my considered opinion that the finances of Bahrain will never be on a satisfactory footing unless the Civil List is made to correspond, to a certain extent, to the actual revenue, increasing and decreasing according to the income of the State. 1 he proportion vv as laid down when the State was comparatively wealthy, unfortunately since then the revenue has diminished by half, but a reference to the comparison of revenue and civil list, which I enclose shows that the fluctuations of the revenue have not proportionally affected the Civil List. I also wish to point out that it is impossible for me myself to persuade the Ruler and his relations to accept a further reduction. In a letter I wrote to the Political Agent some years ago, I explained that owing to my posi tion and work here it was extremely difficult for me to coerce H. E. Shaikh Hamad into agreeing to a course which he strongly disliked. To endeavour to do so would jeopardise my relations with him.5 If this State finds itself in serious financial difficulties it will depend upon the Government of India for monetary assistance. Excluding the possibility of increased revenue from oil it appears to me inevitable that within a year or two the State will be approaching • a condition of bank ruptcy. If the Government of India comes to the conclusion that the Civil List requires readjusting it will be necessary for it to express this opinion very definitely to the lluler himself. I have advised, and urged and argued 'V on the subject and the only result which has been obtained is a saving of Rs. (5,000 out of a total of Rs. 3,86,000. j | Budget 1352. Bevenue — Rs. Rs.

Revenue. —The main feature in the revenue is the deficit of one lac in customs receipts which is dealt with fully in the customs report. Passport receipts fell short of the estimated amount by approximately Rs. 3,000. Judicial receipts produced Rs. 800 Inore than the amount estimated. Land registration fees and leases show a deficit of Rs. 1,000 when com pared to the budgeted amount owing to decrease in land values and rentals of date gardens. | Rent of Government landts includes oil rent and aerodrome rent and ground rents paid by occupants of huts on government land, it has been impossible to recover the full amount from these tenants who are in many cases desti tute. / Interest on fixed deposits, reduced from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent, during the year. : Loans recovered Rs. 7,771 being annual instalment from Muharraq Balidiya from sum lent by government for installation of electricity.

State protection includes leave pay and passage of Captain Parke. Judicial and 117*£/.$.—-The 10 per cent, reduction in the case of the Qadis was cancelled by orders of H. E. Shaikh Hamad.

' The Pearl Industry. 3 The main features of the 1350-51 season may be summed up and ex plained as follows :— 1. The Catch. —The catch was small and no large pearls were found by Bahrain divers. One extremely large pearl, of poor quality, was found by a mainland boat and bought by Messrs. Gozaibi Bros. I No single pearl caught by a Bahrain Boat is said to have realised 1 , at rock bottom price, more than Rs. 15,000. Boats diving - -Fewer boats went out and of those that sailed the proportion of Khammamis greatly increased. The two chief systems of diving are Selafieh and Khammas. In the former case the Nakhuda is financed by a Taajar, and his divers receive the amount of advances laid down by the State, in return foi the financial backing the Nakhuda sells his pearls to his Taajar. Ihe accounts are made up at the end of the season. In the case of Khammamis, the men join a boat and dive for one “Tershah' 5 (trip) and accounts are made after each trip. Divers are ad vanced a few rupees and the cost of equipping a boat for a trip is much less than in the case of Selafieh boats. No debts are carried on from season to season. I L277C F&amp;PD10 The Khammamis divers are less subject to their nakhudas’ discipline as they are not with him permanently, they go to sea for shorter periods and on the whole their system is less substantial and less organised than the Selafteh system and their catches are usually less important. 8. Peart prices .— Almost all the pearls of the new season were soldi and the price of medium and good pearls, “sherin” was about 20 per cent. higher than the market price during the previous season. Unfortunately however most of the big merchants still have on thei 7 * hands very large stocks of pearls which they purchased three or four years ago, at high prices, which they cannot afford to self at a loss. If they sold these pearls now, at the market price, perhaps for half what they paid for them, many of them would become liable to make payments which they still ow e and which fall due w’hen the pearls are sold. 4. Divers debts .—The divers during the last season fared even worse than they did during the previous season. Although the amount of the advances were reduced by the government to the very minimum and owing to the low price of rice etc. the cost of vic tualling boats was less than last year, out of 354 boats the divers of only 6 boats Selafieh made any profit. The earnings of the rest were not sufficient to co\er the amounts which they had advanced and tEeir share in the cost of rations etc. So at the end of the season the divers had increased their debts to their nakhudas and received nothing except the advances which had been debited against them. 5. Comparisons between seasons. —I have stated before (annual report 1350, page 12) that it is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of the season s takings. 1 he figures which I refer to for the purpose of estimates are those of the authorised diving clerks. These men make up the accounts between divers and their nakhudas, so the prices which they quote are the original ^ lock bottom prices paid for pearls. These clerks have no means of knowing about later transactions between nakhudas and taajars or between local merchants and foreign buyers and in each transaction the value of the goods increases. The following is a comparison of the last four seasons founded on the sources which I have mentioned above and I have added to it a statement of importations of pearls into United States over four years showing the three best months of the year which may be of interest. Total no. of Bahrain boats registered for diving. 1347- 48 ... 538 1348- 49 ... 509 1349- 50 ... 504 1350- 51 ... 456 From this it appears that the average production of a boat decreased by about 27 per cent, from last year’s production, i Imports (shown in dollars) into the United States, j Year. July. August. September. Total. 1929 1,261,309 440,120 1,480,474 3,181,903 1930 357,323 211,087 633,591 1,201,901 1931 25,279 51,639 127,742 204,650 1932 27,768 23,000 111,322 162,090 ♦This sum is arrived at by taking an average on the total number of boats diving frdm the actual sums accounted for by the diving clerks frdm the boats whose accounts they made up. Only about 3-4th of the boats have their accounts made up by the authorised clerks. Total value* of pearls in rupees. 21.25.000 18.32.000 12.14.00011 From this it will be seen that in 1929 the import of pearls during the three months was worth almost 3-2 million dollars but the import during the same three months of 1932 was only 162 thousand dollars. Selaf and Tesqam advances .—The amount of the Selaf for the last season was decided as usual by a meeting of merchants and nakhudas at Ks. 30 for a diver and lis. 25 for a puller. On Thursday 26th May which was the official day for the opening of the season, a serious riot took place in which two divers were killed and several were wounded by shots hred by the naturs. At the time of the occurrence I suggested that I should furnish a full report on the matter but J was told that it was not wanted so I did not send one. Should a report on the diving industry be required I have the mate rial available and should be pleased! to write fully, or briefly, on the subject showing the changes and improvements which have been iected since the introduction of the Diving Reforms. The subject is one which interests me particularly and I should be glad to furnish any information about it. The Tesqam was fixed for the same amount as the Selaf at a similar meeting and it was decided that the next Selaf should also be decided upon and the amount should be announced in the same Alaan that proclaimed the Tesqam. This suggestion was adopted and it was proclaimed that the Selaf was to be the same sum as last year. The divers who were the ringleaders of the riot and who were among the foremost of the men who broke into the Police station prison were sentenced to various terms of hard labour, but on the occasion of H. E. Shaikh Hamad's accession celebrations they and various other prisoners were pardoned and liberated. Bahrain diving laws vis-a-vis other Gidf States .—Considerable feeling exists at present on the pai t of the Bahrain diving community over the unequal conditions applied to Bahrain nakhudas and foreign nakhudas. According to the Bahrain diving law T s if a nakhuda employs a diver who actually belongs to some other nakhuda, even for a few days during the season, the new 7- nakhuda automatically becomes responsible to the original nakhuda for the whole debt of the diver who he has employed, unless the diver has a “barwa” from his original nakhuda releasing him for the season. It is customary to issue these “barwas”. In some cases the nakhuda writes on the ‘'barwa” that the diver is free to dive for He season, in other cases he is released on “roba” or “tilth”, by which method the nakhuda employing the diver is bound to deduct l/4th or l/3rd of the diver's earnings and pay it to the original nakhuda. This system is well established in Bahrain and works very effectively. When a Bahrain diver however runs away from his nakhuda and dives with a nakhuda in Oman, or Kuwait or elsewhere, without a “barwa” the Bahrain nakhuda finds that he has no redress. If he follows his diver to Oman and sues the nakhuda who has employed him, the most that he can hope for is that the diver will be made to return to him. In Omaji and Kuwait and other Gulf States the Rulers and Courts now declare that as times are so bad they cannot possibly make their nakhudas responsible for the whole debt of a diver who they may have illegally employed to dive. But w r hen a foreign.nakhuda sues a Bahrain nakhuda in the Bahrain courts for employing one of his divers without a “barwa” the Bahrain nakhuda in accordance with the Bahrain diving laws, is forced to pay the whole amount of the diver’s debt to his original nakhuda. I The Bahrain nakhudas have no objection to the rule being enforced among themselves, in fact it is very necessary in order to prevent nakhudas stealing each other’s divers, but they consider that there should be a different rule in the case of foreign nakhudas suing in Bahrain. If, for example, by Kuwait law a local nakhuda who steals a Bahrain diver is not made responsible for the diver’s debt, equally so when Kuwait nakhudas sue Bahrain nakhudas for taking their divers without “barwas’*12 the Bahrain nakhudas should not be made responsible for the divers debt but should be compelled to return the divers. The Bahrain nakhudas want reciprocal measures to be adopted in this matter. i i Police and Public Security. Police.—Kt the end of 1350, the strength of the Police was 44 Indian Police and 78 Arab Police, during 1351 the complete transition oi the Police from ^-Indian Army Punjabis to a force of locally enlisted men was completed. The Indians rendered very good service to the State and their services were much appreciated especially during emergencies, they were taken on at a time when conditions, particularly public security, were very different to what they are today. When they were enlisted it was imperative that Bahrain should be provided with a force of trained men in as short a time as possible. In those days, seven years ago, the raising oi a local Police Force was not considered practicable, though the Indians supplied a very urgent need as an armed force they were not altogether a success as Police. Very few learned to speak Arabic, they were not popu lar among the local people, the climate did not suit them and they weie very expensive. In addition to this frequent incidents occurred which necessi tated the dismissal of several batches of men which revealed an unsatisfactory state in the interior discipline of the lorce. The new Police force consists of about 40 men who were serving at the end of 1350 and about 90 men who were enlisted since then. With the exception of one Indian Havildar, who belonged to the original Levy Corps all the men were enlisted in Bahrain, but they are a force of mixed nationalities including, besides Bahrain Arabs and Shia Bahama, manumitted slaves, local Persians and a sprinkling of Kurds, Iraqis, Swahili and Sudanese. Two years ago it was almost impossible to obtain local men as recruits for the Police, now when it is announced that men are being enlisted, fifty or sixty applicants attend the Fort every morning. Several causes have contributed to this changed feeling towards serving in the Police; owing to the general depression many men are out of work, diving is no longer a lucrative profession and local Arabs who did not like to serve with Indians are willing to serve with their own countrymen. Once the ice was broken by a few men enlisting, the new recruits advertised the Police and encour aged friends and relations to join. A large proportion of the new men are divers but as far as possible only men with small debts are enlisted; they contribute Rs. 5 per month from their pay which is Rs. 25 p. m. to their nakhudas towards paying off their debts and becoming free men. Owing to the number of applicants it has been possible to raise the standard of height and physique and most of the new recruits are physi cally superior to the old men. In my opinion the best type of men are those of mixed Arab and African extraction, they have more intelligence than the pure African and are tougher than the local Arab or Bahrani. It was found when the force was reorganised that it suffered severely from a lack of capable N. C. Os. and almost all those who did exist were Persians. When the Indian Superintendent of Police completed his agreement and returned to India his duties were transferred to Haji Salman bin Jasim, a Shia Bahrani who has served, in the Police since its formation but who previously dealt almost entirely with criminal work. During the celebrations of H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s coronation he was presented with a third star and his rank is now the equivalent of a Eusbashi in the Egyptian army or police. Various promotions were also made from the local men. Arrangements were made with the 10th Battalion, Baluchi regiment to lend the^State one Havildar, two Naiks and four men as instructors and the training of the recruits has been mainly carried out by them. Their services have been very valuable and owing to their knowledge of the latest methods they are more capable and useful than anv of the old N. C. Os. At the same time two N. C. Os. and two men of the Bahrain Police have been sent to the 10th Battalion, Baluch Regiment, Karachi, to undertake a13 nine months’ course of training as instructors so that when these four men return they will be able to take the place of the Indians who have been lent to the Bahrain Police. Owing to the need of men for carrying out duties it is not possible to give the recruits more than six months training except in the case of indi vidual cases who fail in the tests. Their training includes physical drill, bayonet fighting, musketry, arms drill, squad drill and instruction in general police duties. The programme is an abbreviated form of the Indian Army recruit training course with certain modifications. It is proposed to train the men in lathi drill if an instructor can be obtained from the Indian Police department. Various innovations have been introduced in the routine including football, route marches and physical drill and four young men are being trained as buglers and drummers so that when the Police go on a route march they march to music. The agreement of Captain L. S. Parke, who is now Inspector of Police Mauritius, and who held the post of Assistant Adviser and Commandant , of Police, terminated on 25th September 1933. From the date of his departure on leave in April last I have undertaken the duties which he formerly carried out. Crime .—Considering the general state of want which has been caused by the depression in the diving industry it is surprising that there has been so little crime during the year. Only two cases of murder occurred and one case of an armed raid on a Bahrani village which resulted in grievous hurt to the owner of the house which was attacked. A local Arab in Manamah was murdered during a quarrel by a Nejdi. The murderer was tried and executed. A young woman who gave birth to an illegitimate child was murdered by her four uncles in Muharraq. The murder took place in the house of the victim’s relations which was closely surrounded by other houses. It appears that she was actually killed in the compound, by stabbing, but although the neighbours heard and were aware of what was happening no attempt was made to interfere. The four uncles buried the girl’s body in the floor of the house and escaped. It is thought that they are in hiding in Kattar. Towards the end of the year a night attack was made on the house of a Bahrani in Jed Ali, below Rafaa. After investigations the Police arrested one Isa bin Isa al Mullah of Rafaa. The victim hovered for some time between life and death but finally recovered; the accused was tried and found guilty and sentenced to two years hard labour and deporta tion. The convicted man is a nephew of the notorious Mohomed al Mullah who was sentenced some years ago to penal servitude in India together with several other members of a gang of gunmen who took part in a series of murderous attacks on Bahrani villages, which were instigated by some of the Khalifah Shaikhs and who were finally captured after an unsuccessful attempt to assasinate H. E. Shaikh Hamad. The attack on Jed Ali was made by several persons but unfortunately no information was obtained as to the identity of the other men. In this case none of the Ruling family were implicated. Liquor .—-In my last annual report I mentioned that there was an increase in the illicit manufacture and sale of liquor. A few years ago drunkenness was almost unknown in Bahrain but during the last year or two the habit of drinking liquor has increased very rapidly. The habit has been introduced by Jews, Iraqis and by Bahrain subjects who have travelled in “wet” countries. H. E. Shaikh Hamad regards the use of alcohol by his subjects with extreme abhorrence and he is greatly concerned because several of the younger members of his own family have acquired the habit of intemperance. From the beginning of the year I have been dealing with this matter myself and by means of rewards I have obtained information which has L277c E&amp;PD14 led up to the conviction of about forty-two persons for being concerned in the manufacture or sale of arrak which is a potent liquor distilled from dates. Elaborate organisations existed for selling and distilling liquor. Usually it was in the hands of a group of men but sometimes it was done by one or two individuals. They usually owned or rented several houses and constantly moved from one house to the other in order to evade suspi- cion. The distilling apparatus was kept in one house, usually next door to an empty or tumble down building and other houses and shops were used as distributing centres. Much ingenuity was displayed in disguising this traffic, underground rooms, false walls and wells were employed as hiding places for bottles and apparatus, in one case liquor was sold from a baker's shop and stores of full bottles were kept at the bottom of flour bins and in a disguised oven. The greatest help in detecting arrak, and a feature which cannot be disguised, is its strong sour smell and this frequently disclosed its whereabouts during searches. After making one or two successful night raids the price of arrak rose from Rs. 2 per bottle to Rs. 7 or 8 and I obtained information that the makers had shifted their activities from the town into the country and were sending in supplies on donkeys to the people who sold it. More information was obtained which resulted in raids on three large stills in gardens some miles outside Mana and in two of these cases the principals were arrested although some of the gang were able to escape. Although the courts have dealt severely with cases under the liquor law the trade is such a lucrative one that it still flourishes, especially in Muharraq. In that town it is difficult to deal with, because it is under the patronage of highly placed people. The whole question of liquor is liable to become more complicated with the inevitable advent of more foreigners, apart from Europeans and Americans. Originally permits were issued only to Americans and Europeans, now permits are issued to Jews, Goanese and Indians. The local Jewish community asked that they should be given permits, but permission was refused. On This account they resent the fact'that certain foreign Jews, Iraqis, are allowed permits. Apart from the foreigners there is a feeling among some of the young Arabs that liquor should no longer be forbidden but as H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s views on this subject aire so well known it is improbable that anyone will give voice to this opinion. H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s opinion is that Bahrain is a Moslem State ruled by a Moslem Ruler and therefore it should be “dry” but he does not object to Europeans and Americans being given permits to purchase liquor for their own use. Judicial. m , 1353 1351 Total number of cases— Bahrain Court ....... 668 628 Small court 355 605 1,023 1,133 There has been an increase of about one hundred in the number of cases heard in the Bahrain courts during the year and a decrease of Rs. 2,700 in the total amount of court fees collected from both courts and also from the proportion from fees recovered by the Joint Court which is paid to the Government. jf Although the Bahrain court sits three days during the week, from '8 a. m. to 2 p. m. It is impossible to keep up with the work and there are about 100 pending cases not including some 150 cases which are pending in the Shara courts and the Majlis Tajara. According to the established procedure all cases are filed in the Bahrain court which distributes them when necessarv to the Shara, Majlis Taiara and Small courts. The Shara and Majlis Tajara return the cases to the Bahrain court with their findings which are promulgated by the Bahrain court. The small court, whose maximum is Rs. 200 promuh?atp&lt;? its own orders independently. °15 A great proportion of the time of the Bahrain court is taken up with land oases, boundary disputes and disagreements over water rights and claims by the Wakf departments. Although these cases produce little revenue their settlement is of lasting value. Another matter which also takes time is the proving of ownership in cases of sales and land registra tions. As an additional measure of proof after proclamation has been v issued calling for claims the court requires the applicants to produce wit- ^ nesses to establish their rights either by virtue of long residence or inheritance. This extra proof is of value and importance and in many cases it has saved minors and women from being cheated by their relations or guardians. Appeals .—A proclamation was issued at the beginning of the year laying down a system of appeals. Appeals from the small court are referred to the Bahrain court and appeals from Bahrain court are referred to H. E. Shaikh Hamiad himself. Appropriate fees are levied in appeal cases. During the year only twelve appeals were made from judgments in the Bahrain court and in almost all cases the judgment of the court was upheld. Legislation on mortgages and title deeds .—An important proclamation was issued during the year by which it was laid down that in the case of mortgages persons who hold government title deeds have a prior right over persons only holding sennads. This order encourages the registration of titles and also prevents further litigation on the question of boundaries, water rights and titles to property which is held as mortgage by claimants in courts. Considerable confusion existed previously as the Shara law and the local custom differed specifically on the matter of priority of claims. By Shara law the mortgage was invalid in certain cases unless it had been actually taken into possession. The law made by the government follows more closely the local custom. Siadi case .—This case is now entering on its fourth year in the Bahrain court but out of the mass of different issues which are involved the greater proportion have been decided and it is hoped 1 that the case will be finally closed within a few months. The amount involved is over ten lacs and the court has had to deal with some fifty or sixty different issues each one involving lengthy litigation and reaching back over ten or twelve years. Court Wakils .—Several cases occurred during the year in which it was proved that wakils acting in the courts had misappropriated funds which had been paid to them on behalf of their principals by the court. In the Bahrain court two such persons were sentenced to hard labour. The matter is now under consideration and rules are being framed regarding wakils practising in the courts which will be submitted to H. E. Shaikh Hamad for approval. It is proposed to demand a deposit which could consist of a mortgage on property if cash was not forthcoming, in the case of professional wakils, but persons who appear on behalf of their wives, children or near relations will be exempted from the payment of a deposit! The fees chargeable by a wakil acting for women or minors will be laid down by the court but in other cases the parties will be at liberty to come to any arrangement which they may like to. Shaikh Jasim’s affairs .—Last year, on the suggestion of H. B. M.’s Political Agent the Bahrain court took over the control of the affairs and property of Shaikh Jasim al-Mehza, the aged e.r-Qadi of Bahrain. Owing to his complete blindness and the unsatisfactory behaviour of some of his relations there was danger of his extensive property being misappropriat ed. Ihe Qadi agreed that the government should administer his property and collect the rents which was done successfully for about a vear. Finally however he complained and requested the government to hand back the administration into his hands which was done. Litigation immediatelv ^ recommended and is likely to continue as long as the Shaikh deals with his own affairs. He was however persuaded to register all his property which will ensure its not passing out of hands.1G A similar case, that of Shaikh Abdulrehman bin Abdulwahab al Khalifah was dealt with by the court which made an arrangement by which one of the Shaikh’s sons should administer the father’s property and sub mit the accounts to the court. In this case the father was a very large landowner but in his dotage. Land Registrations^ Registra ions during 1351—457— Sales registered 233 Cancellations 13 Gifts . . 21 Titles . . 1S&amp; Copy . . 1 Revenue from above Rs. 5,052 The revenue collected from registrations is about Rs. 3,000 less than the previous year’s revenue. This is partly owing to the continued decrease in the value of property and also because for reasons of economy it has been necessary to reduce the stall of this department. There are now only two surveyors and it is impossible to carry out as much work as was done before when four surveyors were employed, i Apart from the registration of sales and titles, the department sub mitted reports with plans on 346 land disputes to the Bahrain and Agency Courts; this work is unproductive of revenue but it entails considerable time and trouble, however it would be very difficult for the courts to deal with many of the complicated boundary and water right cases without the plans and reports which are provided by this department. Land Settlement. —Very little survey work has been done during the year; the district of Shahrakhan was mapped and the district of Sadad, which was started in 1351, was completed, j Fish Trays. —598 fish traps were registered during the year, including renewals. Printed forms are now issued for these registrations somewhat similar to those issued as diving licenses. The public as a whole appreciate the registration of fish traps, they have gradually come to regard the posses sion pf a “paper from the government” as an inviolable proof of ownership although actually in the case of fish traps the annual registration, with out registration of title, is not a definite proof of ownership. Government forms .—During the year, 13,284 government forms, which are sold for 2 annas each, were issued. No sanads or wakalas, etc., are accepted by the courts unless written on government forms. These forms correspond somewhat to stamp duties but until now the amount on the receipt or the sanad does not affect the price of the form. It has been suggested that, as in Muscat, the forms should bear revenue stamps corres ponding to the amount of money which is involved. j Khalifieh Estates.—In my last annual report (page 34) I mentioned a meeting wffiich took place between the Hon’ble the Political Resident, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, the Political Agent, Bahrain, and H. E. Shaikh Hamad, and Shaikhs Abdulla and Salman at which it was agreed that according to the family custom of the Ruling family, gifts of land by the Ruler were only valid during the lifetime of the holder of the gift. On the death of the holder the property should revert to the Ruler. The matter was thoroughly discussed and unanimously agreed upon by the Shaikhs, i his important decision was mentioned in a letter written after the meet ing by the Political Agent to H. E. Shaikh Hamad and the matter was referred to again in a public speech made by the Hon’ble the Political Resident during the celebrations on the occasion of H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s succession. ! A few months before the end of the year a test case occurred. A wife of Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, who did not belong to the Khalifah family.17 died without leaving any children. She held two or three gardens which were “hiba’* iron Shaikh Isa. These gardens according to the custom reverted to the Huler. Unfortunately Siiaikh Mohomed bin Isa seized this opportunity to oppose the previous decision by every possible means and he endeavoured to induce some of his relations to support him. Although his brothers and his nephew Shaikh Salman had solemnly agreed that such property should be held lor life, Shaikh Mohammad denied that the custom ^ had ever existed. When innumerable examples were quoted of Shaikh Isa having taken back property which he had gifted after the death of the recipient Shaikh Mohomed tried to prove that each of these cases were governed by particular reasons not by family customs. H. E. Shaikh Hamad was much displeased by Shaikh Mohomed s attitude and by his vio lent language. Eventually Shaikh Mohomed suggested that if an exception was made in the case of his own property he would withdraw all opposition and give the matter his support, provided 'that he was given a binding written pro mise that the gifts of land held by him and his sons should be theirs m perpetuity, never to revert to the Euler. It was finally decided that the matter should be postponed for a month or two; at the time of writing this report no further action has Been taken. { If the Ruler of Bahrain enforces this custom it will assist him to estab lish his authority over his family. This authority in days gone by was very great but now it is merely nominal. The custom would ensure that the Ruling Family retained their estates without which they would expect even greater financial support from the State than they now obtain. It might be suggested, in fact it actually was suggested by Shaikh Mohomed, that the Ruler on the death of some member of the family might take oyer all his property and leave tne family unprovided for. When discussing this point with other members of the Khalifah family they all assured me that public opinion and family opinion would be sufficiently strong to pre vent the Ruler from adopting such a course even if he was inclined to do so. Education. The progress of education during the year has been satisfactory and no disturbances like those which took place in the past have occurred. There are now five bo&gt;s schools and two girls’ schools and the total average attendance is 644 boys and girls although 828 are enrolled. Out of the 27 teachers 15 are local and 12 are foreign, the foreign ones being mostly Syrians. There is undoubtedly some feeling among the people against the foreign school teachers but the standard of education is stilly so low that it is impossible to obtain satisfactory local teachers for the higher posts in the schools and it is impossible to obtain any local women who are capable of teaching and managing the girls schools, j A mala amotion of Shia and Sunni schools .—Early in the year, at the beginning of the present school year, the Government carried out its inten tion of amalgamating the two boys schools in Manamah. i The Manamah girls’ school was previously housed in a building which was rented by the Government, the girls’ school was moved into what used to be the Sunni boys school. It is a large airy house and suitable for a school, it w 7 as purchased as a school by the Government about ten years ago. Screens were put up in front of the windows in order to ensure privacy. The Sunni boys school moved into the big Shia'school on the south of the town which was built by the government about three years ago. The school is a verv fine building and can hold about 300 boys but at the end of the previous year ordy about 40 boys were attending and of these quite a number were Sunni. The action of the government in combining the two schools was much resented by the Shias whose attitude was that of the dog in the manger, for about a year the attendance had been very small L277c f&amp;pdand school was 3-4 empty but at the same time the Shias resented the school being used by Sunnis at well as themselves. It is true, that the Sbia community had contributed a small proportion of the cost of the building but as the school was open equally to Shias and Sunnis there was no logical argument against the Government’s action which effected a large saving in expense. Unfortunately only about 40 Shias are attending the school and the remaining 100 boys are all Sunnis. A small private school has been opened by a son of one of the leading Shias which is attended by some of the boys who were previously educated at the Government school. Topical play. —At the end of the last term, a play was performed in Arabic before a large audience by.boys from the two schools. The play was written by the President of the Islamieh college in Beyrout but it was slightly adapted and made very topical. The play dealt'with a dishonest ‘Wali’ who had charge of the property of some minors and the villain of the piece, I believe unintentionally, resembled unmistakably in manner and appearance a certain leadmg Muharraq merchant who recently appeared in Court on a charge of misappropriating the money of certain minors with which he was entrusted. The play was very well and intelligently acted and was altogether a success., Manamah Municipality. Rs. 1350 Revenue . . . . . . . . . 62,000 1351 55,000 „ Expenditure 60,900 In spite of a falling off in revenue the Manamah Municipality has carried out some noticeable improvements in the town during the year. Inner Sea Road. —The new sea road running east and west along what used to be the foreshore of the town, inside and parallel to the sea road, is now almost completed at a total cost up to date of approximately Rs. 15,000 This cost does not include the value of ground given in compen sation to owners of property from whom land was taken in order to make the road. The new road will be very useful in the future and has effectively opened up the long strips of private property which extend from the edge of the town down to the original sea road.i The road is 30 feet wide and averages about five feet in height from the surface of the shore. About 4,000 cubit feet of stone were used for building the road across areas which had not been reclaimed from the sea. Bazaar wideniny .—A road running up to the bazaar between the Customs House and the Police Station has been widened and extended and will eventually cut ris’ht through the town to the open ground opposite the Fort. This new road is wide and well adapted for motor traffic and several handsome new shops have been built upon it This road has become one of the best localities in the bazaar. A number of shops and offices were partly demolished in order to make the road but whenever possible they were re built by the Municipality, in cases where this could not be done the owners were compensated. ! A wide road running east and west from the Government school to the sea was made on the south of the town. About 25 barasti huts were moved in order to make the road. Country Roads —An arrangement was made by which the Municipali ty became responsible for road work and repairs outside the Municipal aiea on the main Rafaa road as far as the end of the date gardens and also the Buueya road up to Jed Hafs. This previously was done by the government but as the municipality have a permanent staff of road' men it is more economical for them to do such work |'19 A road was made through date gardens running north and south whic h links up the Kalaa road and the Budeya road. Previously the country between these two roads was inaccessible to motor traffic except on the road from Suk al Khamis to Senabis. The cost of this road was small as it was only necessary to make a few bridges and to level the surface in places. Widening of Rafaa road .—On the Rafaa road through the date gar- dens, there occurred during the year an accident in which a taxi collided ' with a car in which H. L. Shaikh Hamad was driving and overturned it into the ditch. Fortunately nobody was injured but the incident enabled the government to carry out the project of widening the whole road through the gardens which had been under consideration for some years. An average of 15 leet in the width has been added to the wdiole road from Suk al Khamis to Raddam al Kawari and mainly owing to the public spirited! example set by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and some others none of the owners of the gardens from whom ground was taken demanded any compensation lor date trees or land. About 400 date trees were cut down but except in the case of two wakf gardens no payments were made, the fences however were rebuilt at the expense of the municipality. This road is the most used and most important road in Bahrain and owing to its narrowness and its many blind corners it had become very dangerous. It was unsuited to much motor traffic and a particular source of danger were the heavy lorries and tractors used by the Bahrain Petroleum Company which travelled up and down the road several times daily. The new part of the road is now being levelled and the ditches are being filled in. i Hoad work by the Bahrain Petroleum Co. —During the year the Bahrain Petroleum Co. have done a great deal of useful work on the roads which they used and owing to this the government has been saved consider able expense in the upkeep of roads. A grader has been used very effectively on the Manamah—Rafaa—Sakhir road and small portion of it has been raised to prevent the usual flooding during the rains. The Com pany constructed a new road, with an oiled surface, from below the Rafaa hill to their camp and on to Al-Amr. Al-Amr can now be reached from Manamah within an hour, before the new road was made it took consider ably longer. Petrol St ore.--A petrol store was built at Suwefieh, on the shore about one mile west of Manamah. The store is 100 ft. * 80 feet, built of stone, cement, iron girders and corrugated iron roof. Rent is paid to the Munici pality by importers who store petrol there. According to municipal law shopkeepers are forbidden to store more than a limited number of tins inside the town area owing to danger from fire. A rtesian wells. —Seven artesian welR within the town were fitted with valves and upright pipes according to the government’s order. The tanks which formerly held surplus water, and which bred mosquitoes have been demolished and the water is available from taps set along horizontal pipes. Repercussions from A.P.O.C. dispute .—When news reached Bahrain that the Persian government had cancelled the A.P.O.C. agreement meetings were held among the local Persian community and a rumour was spread that Bahrain’s supply of petrol and paraffin would be cut off. In half a day the price of paraffin rose to more than double the market price. In order to combat the profiteering the government arranged for the municipa lity to purchase a large amount of paraffin and sell it at the ordinary price. This was done and price immediately descended to normal. It was after wards stated that the government itself had bought up the paraffin and having made a corner it was selling it at a high price. Municipal Ice machine.-—lev was manufactured during the summer from electric power and was sold at 4-£ pies per pound instead of 74 pies which was last year’s price. This is considered a public utility service and the municipality contents itself with a small profit after covering all expenses.20 The lengthy disagreemeDt involving H. E. Shaikh Hamad, the Bahrain government S and y the municipality with Mr. Yusuf Khunji, the Manchester merchant was finally settled. . Liability for municipal taxes.—A resolution which the governffent has been urging on the municipality for several years was passed by the Ma j to the effect that landlords, not tenants, are liable tor the payment of municipal taxes on their property. It is an achievement to have the acceptance of this principle in Manamah, it was suggested in Muharraq, but opposed by aimost all the members. Anti-Malarial measures .—A pump worked by an oil engine was kept working for several months pumping the water out from the swamp south of the town into a channel which carried it down to the sea. Two women were appointed to report to the municipality cases of persons allowing mosquitoes to breed in wells inside their houses. Crude ov was sprayed on to stagnant water on the south of the town. The council passed orders that all unreclaimed ground adjacent to the sea road should be filled in. Unfortunately these orders were not carried out and it was eventually decided that owing to the general shortage of money the owners could not be expected to undertake the filling in. Municipal aarden .—The municipal garden, which is much frequented by the public, especially during the summer evenings, has been repaired and put in order. The water channels have been cleaned out and cemented so that thev are no longer a breeding place for mosquitoes. The western portion of the garden has been laid out with paths and trees and bushes have been planted in it. A small zoological garden has been formed which includes ibex, wolves, monkeys, an eagle and a bear, the latter was presented by Captain Prior after he left Bahrain. | It was again proposed that women should be allowed to use the garden on one day during the week but this suggestion was violently opposed by the majority of the members and by the president himself who, having recently visited London, referred to restrictions which apply in Hyde park. The council prides itself on its progressive point of view but in this matter it is extremely conservative. Two small gardens were made in the maidan opposite the Mission church and when these grow up they will form a pleasant oasis in that part of the town.. Miscellaneous. —The Municipal offices were repaired and improved, the floors were tiled with locally made tiles and the roof was renovated. Three streets in the bazaar were re-roofed. It was suggested that corrugated iron should be used as being more lasting than matting but owing to the initial expense the project was abandoned. | 38.000 pies were imported from India for circulation in the bazaar. The rate of taxi fares was revised and tariff cards were issued to all taxi drivers. The slaughter house was repaired. ! 48 persons were prosecuted for failing to keep their house drains in order. 50.000 cubic feet of swamp on the south of the town was filled in with town rubbish and earth. ! A dozen poor boxes were set up in various parTs of the bazaar. Contri butions are disappointing and consist mainly of counterfeit coins. Rs. 2,000 was spent on the upkeep of the lunatic asylum. A tax was imposed on donkeys entering the town. 1 Sheep were imported during Ramadaan and the meat was sold at ccst price. i During the absence cf Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, on a European tour the duty of President was undertaken by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khali fah.Muharraq Municipality. Ks. Rs. 1^0 13ol Eevenue v , . . • 37,122 33,319 Expenditure ..... Rs. 28,316 27,758 Outstanding against the Baladiya— 3,141 Loan from Manama!) Baladiva—also 23,313 loan from the Bahrain Government for installation of electric supply in Muharraq. The expenditure for 1351 includes payment of an instalment, Rs. 7,771 due to the Government from thei account loaned for electric exten sion. Very little new work of importance, apart from the usual activities of the municipality such as street lighting, cleaning, repairs to roads, etc., has been carried out during the year. Several streets in the bazaar were re-roofed, the pier was resurfaced and some roads were widened and awkward corners were removed. The style of building in Muharraq town is not conducive to road widening as most of the houses are two or three storied and the greater proportion of them are built of stone. The town is congested, surrounded on three sides by the sea, and as there has never been any room for expansion the tendency in the past has been to reduce the width of the streets in order to make more room for houses. There are no maidans or open spaces in Muharraq town and it is partly for this reason that the heat in the summer becomes so exces sive that many of the Muharraq people migrate to Manamah during the hot weather, A great improvement has been effected by the (filling in of one end of the creek at the Muharraq landing place and the widening of the pier near the customs house. Part of the reclaimed ground has been leased out by the municipality on very advantageous terms. Other work carried out during the year includes the following . Repairing the sea wall between Muharrak and Busaiteen. Constructing two compounds for donkeys. Before these were made donkeys were left standing or tethered at any place in the bazaar. The drains from several wells running to the sea were repaired. Although most of the artesian wells in Muharraq were made by individuals for the benefit of the public the cost of looking after them is undertaken by the Baladiya. The Government doctor treated 11,953 cases at the Maharaq dispensary. The Municipal nurse had 4,578 clinic patients during the year and attended 19 confinement cases, of which 15 were successful cases. A rtesian wells. Twelve new artesian wells were sunk in Bahrain during the year. The question of the government’s control over artesian wells and the prevention of waste of water and the elimination of stagnant water in which mosquitoes breed has been under consideration for some time. In Septem ber 1932, Major Holmes of the Bahrain Petroleum Co., expressed his views on the subject in a letter to H. E. Shaikh Hamad. As the expert who first bored wells in Bahrain he pointed out the danger of reducing the water supply and the pressure by promiscuous drilling and unrestrained flow of water. L277c F&amp;PDThe matter was discussed and finally the Bahrain Government issued a proclamation laying down the conditions under which wells could be sunk which are as follows : No more wells are allowed in Manamah, Muharraq, Hidd, or Calali as these towns are well supplied with water. All wells must be provided with valves and overflow pipes so that the overflow can be regulated and when not in use the water can be turned off. Minimum length of pipe to be used in the well is 90 feet. An initial fee of Rs. 100 to be paid for permission to ^ bore and an annual rent of Rs. 50 for all wells used for agriculture or personal requirements. Wells used to supply the public with water are not liable for this tax. All wells are to be inspected by a government official in order to ensure their being kept in proper order. It is hoped that these regula tions will have the effect of preventing waste of water and in reducing the amount of mosquitoes. ■ Agriculture. Unfortunately no real progress has been made in this direction during 1351. The services of Mr. Said Abdul Nour who was obtained in 1930 from the Department of Agriculture, Iraq, were dispensed with during the year. Owing to lack of money it was impossible to utilise the services of this official to the best advantage. No funds were available for purchasing trees or for carrying out experimental work and the cotton crop which was planted last year was not grown again, it was proved however that cotton can be grown in Bahrain successfully. The services of an agricultural expert would undoubtedly be of great benefit to Bahrain but at present they cannot be 'afforded. Orange cultivation. —A few of the orange trees planted in H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s garden, Sanayan, on the Mani road, were allowed to bear fruit and the oranges ripened successfully and were of exceptional size and of good quality. The trees are growing well and in the spring of 1351 about one-third of the trees blossomed and many of them are now bearing young oranges. It can be definitely assumed that oranges can be grown successfully in Bahrain and if private individuals would experiment in this direction they would find a ready market in the local bazaar and possibly in neigh bouring Gulf ports. Private enterqyriee. —Cultivation is gradually increasing all over the island but the nature of the cultivation remains conservatively the same and consists entirely of dates, lucerne and a few species of local vegetables. Only a few people such as Khan Saheb Yusuf Kanoo and Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Gozaibi import new varieties of trees or experiment with seeds. The family of Arayyad recently purchased a large area of ground behind the Fort and this has been planted out with date trees. It is irrigated by an artesian well. Date crop. —The date crop of 1351 was considerably better than the crop of 1350. Bahrain was not visited by locusts and the trees did not suffer from any date desease: Storm damage. —An unusually severe storm occurred towards the end of the year which did a great deal of damage in the gardens. Several thousand date palms were torn up by the roots or snapped in two. It is impossible to arrive at an estimate of the damage but in one garden alone containing about 600 trees 78 were destroyed. The average value of the crop from one tree can be taken as Rs. 3 and if the value of a full grown tree is calculated at 10 years produce the loss in this garden alone amounted to over Rs. 2.000. Unfortunately the tallest and the finest trees were the ones most affected as owing to their height they were more exposed to the wind. The indications of the new date crop are satisfactory and the abnormal amount of rain does not appear to have caused any harm to the young datesnSunni Wakf Defai'tment. Expenditure on this department during 1351—Rs. 2,400. This department, though its staff are paid by the government, is not under the direct supervision of the government and nothing is known of its activities. The balance sheet of the department is as follows : — IU Rs. Batmoj from 1350 ..... 1,371 Outstanding debts at end of year L350 Revenue 1351 — • • • . 10,567 from «hops and arnaraa . . 11,977 „ gardens .... . lo,yil 22,918 Expenditure 1351— Imams, Miuddins and teachers, etc. . 18,815 Repairs to shops .... • • • 1,650 „ „ gardens .... . 652 20,117 Balance in hand end of 1351 • • • 2.754 Outstanding debts „ ... . . imt&gt;5 The annual report of the department shows that 666 date trees were planted and about 6 shops were built or rebuilt and 15 shops were repaired.

The elections for the new majlis which began at the end of 1350 were completed early in 1351 and the new Majlis held its first meeting after Muharam. As usual the department was embarassed by the incessent quarrels among the various antagonistic factions of the Shias. Towards the end of the year a Katifi mullah of Bahrani origin organised a public attack on the Wakf department and produced a number of public petitions, of doubtful authenticity, asking that the majlis should be dismissed and that the govern ment itself should deal with all Shia wakfs. The agitation was undoubtedly encouraged by one of the Shia Kadis, Shaik Ali bin Hassan, partly under the misguided impression that such a request would be pleasing to the gov ernment. Many of the genuine signatories to the petitions were persons who were in debt to the department and who probably believed that by upsetting the majlis they would escape their liabilities. A proclamation was issued by the government stating that no change in the administration would be considered until all the outstanding rents had been recovered. It was hoped that as all the members were elected by the public themselves such incidents as this would not have occurred but the Bahama, as they admit themselves, have such a love of intrigue that it is unlikely that they will ever refrain from conspiring against a majlis which consists entirely of their own people. During the year fifteen wakfs were discovered which had not been registered in the department and these are now being administered by the majlis. About 30 mosquejwere repaired and work was done in 68 gardens and over 1.700 young date trees were purchased and planted in wakf property. Several small gardens were purchased in order to consolidate wakf property and two pieces of ground were sold at a very advantageous prices and the proceeds were used to buy a more productive garden than the ones sold. The work of registering the titles of all wakf property is very slow and whenever an opportunity occurs the Sunni neighbours to the Shia k Wakfs endeavour to prove a counterclaim.Audit. During the last month of the year all the government accounts for the preceding eleven months were audited by a chartered accountant from the firm of Whinney Murray &amp; Co., who have an agency in Baghdad. This is the first time that any accounts 4 of the Bahrain Government have been audited. If funds were available I should recommend that an audit should take place annually. It was impossible owing to the cost to afford the time to carry out a complete audit on commercial lines but sufficient detail was checked to satisfy the auditor that the accounts were properly kept and the systems were satis factory. A number of suggestions were made which have been adopted since the beginning of the new year. , The auditor reported very satisfactorily on the accounts of all depart ments with the exception of the Electric Supply department. The gist of the report on the various departments was as follows : Bahrain Government. —Consolidated fund and Deposit account. Books well and accurately kept, no alterations recommended. Suggested that printed “payslips” should be introduced to be signed by the Adviser authorising payments in place of a signature on office notes. State Police. —The separate account kept by the Police has been closed and the Police account is now merged into the Consolidated Fund. An imprest account has been opened with the Police and all payments outside this account are made from the Consolidated Fund direct. As there is at present no Police Officer the new arrangement is particularly convenient. A new system was laid down for keeping the Police clothing account. Passport department. —The system of accounts was slightly altered. Government provident fund. —Books well kept and no alteration recom mended, entries checked. v Customs department. —A few minor suggestions were made. “The whole system of the accounts, which combine simplicity with sufficient detail to enable the Director of Customs to exercise constant supervision over all departments, appears to us to be admirably suited to its purpose and we do hot think any departure from the present procedure is desirable.” The report on this department is particularly satisfactory as it has fre quently been suggested that the customs accounts were unnecessarily compli cated and that some of them were not actually required. Bahrain Electric Supply. —Payments were checked without difficulty but there was considerable difficulty in reconciling the receipts in the cash book and subsidiary books and the Bank pass book. A deficiency of approximately Rs. 400 was found between the Sundry debtors account and the detailed list of debtors. It was not suggested that any misappropriation of cash had occurred but from the state of the books it would be impossible to discover any such misappropriation. The reason is ascribed partly to the fact that some of the accounts were kept in the State Engineer’s office and some of them in Adviser’s office. On the advice of the auditor the whole system and accounts have been rearrranged and various changes have been made in the method of collecting etc., which are described in the report on the Elec tric Supply department. : • Manamah and MuharrUq Municipalities. —Books were well kept but unnecessarily complicated. A simpler system wds suggested. A number of observations were made on the various accounts in the ledger such as the necessity to provide for depreciation in the Ice machine account. * In Muharraq Baladiya it was remarked that a number of debit balances were due from members of the Majlis (including the President) which were not authorised in the minutes of the majlis. The control and check over receipts from House and shops taxes is inadequate. A new and more efficient system was suggested. This is a matter of importance as the greatest part of the Municipalities’ revenue is from these taxes. g25 Shia Wakf department .—There are over 1,800 different accounts in this department and it was impossible to check all of them in the timei avail able. The cash book, receipts, etc., were checked and various suggestions made to simplify the method of keeping the accounts. Im'perial Ainvays. On 6th October 19'32, the first machine of the Imperial Airways landed in Bahrain on the R. A. F. landing ground behind the Palace, the machine sunk into the ground and was only able to rise, next day with great difficulty. From then onwards the Imperial Airways used the Muharraq plain as an aerodrome and agreed that they would pay whatever fees or rental were decided upon when a definite agreement was made between the Company and the government, the payment was to commence from the date on which the aerodrome was first used. | Innumerable officials of the Imperial Airways and the R. A. F. officers visited Bahrain, discussed the proposed agreement and examined sites for aerodromes. Several draft agreements were produced and have been the subject of correspondence but so far no agreement has been made and no decision has been arrived at as to where the permanent aerodrome is to be situated. The Government of Bahrain while appreciating the benefits of the Air service is not prepared to allow the company free facilities for landing and it considers that the company should pay to the government a reasonable amount, either annually or for each landing, similar to the fees charged in other countries. For the last eight months the government has provided a Police guard on the aerodrome on each occasion that a machine has landed in Bahrain. The lengthly delay on the part of the company in coming to any arrangement is thought by the government to be somewhat unreasonable. Press propaganda. There appears to be a slight decrease in the press propaganda referring to Bahrain in the Arab and Persian newspapers owing perhaps to the regulation which forbids newspaper correspondents to enter the country unless they have previously obtained permission to do so. A long series of ably composed articles were published in the Iran tracing the history of Bahrain and its connection with Persia from the earliest days until the present time. The articles showed signs of consider able research both in Persian and Arab histories and in European writings and by judiciously emphasising certain points and almost ignoring other points the writer succeeded in making the Persian claim to Bahrain appear very substantial. To anyone however who was acquainted with the sources from which the writer obtained his information and also many sources which he deliberately ignored it would be apparent that the perspective of his historical summary was incorrect and leant unduly in the Persian direction. 1 To quote an example; the writer refused to admit that Bahrain belonged to the Portuguese. He states that Hormuz was originally a tributary of Persia and was occupied by the Portuguese. The Portuguese sent a force from Hormuz and took Bahrain but they took it not for themselves but for Hormuz and because Hormuz was originallv a tributary of Persia therefore Bahrain was taken by the Portuguese for Persia. I The articles caused a great deal of interest in Bahrain especially among the Persian community. Counterfeit coins. A serious state of affairs has occurred during the last year owing to the alarming increase in counterfeit defaced and diminished rupees which L277 cF&amp;PD26 have found their way into Bahrain. Three or four year s a go it was com paratively unusual to discover bad coins in the market but to-day it has been estimated that as many as 5 per cent, of the rupees in currency are bsd ones. For over a year every coin which is received either by merchants or in offices is tested by ringing on stone or metal before it is accepted. The matter is further complicated by the fact that th£ Bank, quite rightly, re fuses to accept suspicious coins not only coins which do not ring true but also coins which are obviously counterfeited. The local people only know and admit one method of testing coins and that is ringing them and only a few foreign merchants and Indians can distinguish counterfeit coins by their appearance. : The matter has been fruitlessly discussed at great length by the tw^o Municipal councils whose view is that the Bank and all Government offices should be made to accept every coin except those whose ring is obviously false. This point of view is one which cannot be accepted by the Govern ment. A suggestion was made that the Government should levy &amp; special tax on all specie and -coins imported and with the fund obtained by this tax it should buy in all counterfeit coins. This would encourage the traffic of counterfeit coins at the expense of the Bahrain tax payer. Another suggestion was that Indian currency notes should be introduced but as the lowest denomination of paper money in India is five rupees this proposal would not solve the problem. It was also suggested that the Bahrain Government should establish its own currency of one rupee paper notes. In order to establish a currency a reserve fund would be necessary and this at present can scarcely be said to exist. ; Death of Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali, accession of H. E. Shaikh Hamad bin Isa. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., O.S.I., died suddenly on 9th December 1932. He was of great age and had been in failing health for many years. He died in the early morning while H. E. Shaikh Hamad was out hunting in the south of the Island. It is a signi ficant fact and caused considerable comment that the widow of the late Ruler gave orders that the funeral should take place at once, without wait ing for H. E. Shaikh Hamad to arrive. H. E. Shaikh Hamad reached the cemetery a few minutes before the ceremony was completed. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa was on a visit to the mainland and Shaikh Sulman, who was at his country house, arrived at Muharraq after the funeral. Owing to the. unsuitable haste with which the arrangements were made no Police or officials attended and many of the chief Khalifah Shaikhs were unable to arrive in time. ; IT. E. Shaikh Hamad's accession was celebrated about two months later. The principal event was a Durbar, the biggest which has ever been held in Bahrain, which took place in the great hall of the Government school, 9th February 1933 (14th Shawaal, 1351) at which the Hon’ble the Political Resident delivered to His Excellency a “Kharita” from His Excellency the Viceroy congratulating him on his succession. The Kharita was received with a salute of 31 guns and at the close of the proceedings a salute of 100 guns wms fired. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, representatives of the Navy and Air Force, the European and American community and about 500 of the leading Arabs, Qadis, merchants and notables attended the Durbar. At the close of the proceedings all Shaikh Hamad’s subjects, including the chief men of the various Arab tribes, did obeisance to him as Ruler bv kissing his forehead according to the Arab custom. For three days there were unprecedented and universal rejoicings; thousands of poor people were fed outside the Talace, tribal dances were performed, and the towns vrere decorated and illuminated. H. E. Shaikh Hamad succeeded to The estates of his father which consisted mainly of date gardens but as the late Shaikh had gifted away27 most of his valuable property towards the end of his lifetime the value of H. E, Shaikh Hamad’s inheritance was comparatively small. A vast accumulation of official letters and correspondence which was found in H. E. Shaikh Isa’s boxes were brought to the Government office to be sorted and examined but as it includes about 4000 documents it has not yet been possible to deal with them. i All Shaikh Isa’s personal belongings, which are reputed of great value, were taken over by his widow who, is the daughter of Shaikh Mohommed bin Khalifah who died in exile in the Hejaz. Towards the end of the year H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s salute was in creased from 7 to 11 guns. Bahrain Electric Supply. Economic depression continues to affect the revenue of this department. Owing to the continued depression the number of wiring orders which were received were less than was expected when last year’s annual report was written. The revenue from sale of energy would have been greater, if many of the public, for reasons of economy, had not substituted their 40 or 60 watt lamps for 5 watt lamps made, in Germany and Japan. However in spite of these circumstances there is an increase of Rs. 5,000 in the revenue from sale of energy during 1351 and the profits from wiring, in spite of a reduction in the cost per point, are only about Rs. 600 less than during the previous year. | Running costs in 1350 amounted to Rs. 37,300 approximately and! in 1351 to Rs. 38,000 approximately not including depreciation which amount ed to Rs. 22,473 in 1350 and Rs. 20,796, in 1351. During 1351 the actual loss, apart from depreciation, was Rs. 5,800 approximately, but this amount includes, in the expenditure, Rs. 2,704 being the payment for insurance of the machinery, and also about Rs. 1,200 paid to the Customs department in dues on material imported. It was found at the end of the year that outstanding debts owing to the department amounted to Rs. 7,246. The department found it increas ingly difficult to collect the amounts from nearly 400 different houses and shops in Manamah and Muharraq. In many cases the meter readers and collectors had to call four or five times at the same house before being allowed to see the meter and before obtaining money. It was decided that from the beginning of the new year the system of collection would be altered and consumers would be called upon to pay their bills at the Govern ment office instead of paying them to house to house collectors. Persons owing debts were threatened with being cut off and prosecuted and by using somewhat drastic measures most of the putstanding amountsTwas recovered. It is hoped that the new system will be more effective than the old one. The report of Mr. W. B. Steele, State Engineer, is as follows: The Bahrain Electric Supply department has again been seriously affected by the general economic depression, but the returns for 1351 show a marked increase in revenue, and the financial position is more favourable than’ it was at the end of 1350. 1 The following extra load has been connected during 1351 : 457 points making a total of 22 Kilowatts, of which 267 are light points and 190 fan points and heaters etc. Four refrigerators and three water pumps have also been connected making a total of 23 Kilowatts. Revenue from connected load during 1351 was Rs. 27,462 as compared with Rs. 22,485 in 1350. . During the year 116 houses were wired, 96 in Manamah and 20 in Muharraq. 128 Wiring contracts .--Wiring has proceeded steadily during 1351, and the price per point has been further reduced, and is now as low as economi cally possible. It has been kept low in order to encourage the public to take electricity. In some cases houses have been wired as low as Rs. 14 per point using Callenders “Kaleeco” wire and fitttings, the cost per point depending on the distance apart. j In connection with the sale of electrical appliances and wiring (and consequent consumption of electricity), a showroom has been opened on the sea road, in a central position opposite the Eastern Bank, and in a thoroughfare which promises to be the leading street in the town of Manamah. New ofhces have also been opened on the same site, the premises which are the property of II. E. Shaikh Hamad, having been rented by the* department. Ice Plant. —The Municipal ice plant was run very successfully during the summer of 1351, and at the end of the run the plant was given a com plete overhaul. Ihe chief components of the amonia compressor were renewed, such as the piston, cylinder, bearings, valves, etc., this being necessary on account of the age of the plant, which was practically worn out. Owing to the plant having only one compressor, it has to run continuous ly for approximately four and half months during the season. The question of purchasing a second compressor should be seriously considered for the season of 1353. Consumption .—The revenue from the sale of electricity would have been much more, but for the fact that a large number of consumers changed theii; lamps from those supplied, originally, 40 or 60 watts to 5 watts. These are German and Japanese lamps obtainable in the local bazaar, and give just enough light to see by, provided that one has good eyesight. They seem however to suit very many of the local consumers, particularly those of the poorer class. ! It has been pointed out that if this practice increases it would call for an increase in the price of the unit to counteract the loss in revenue. 7 ransmission losses .—Units lost in transmission during the year amounted to 18 5 per cent, as compared to 23'4 per cent, during 1350. This is due to the increased load and to the fact that transformers were switched out whenever possible during the winter, j Fuel and Lubricating oils. —Fuel oil costs per unit are slightly lower, 25 annas per unit as compared with '33 in 1350, due to the purchasing price of the oil being slightly lower, and the load slightly more. Lubricating oil cost per unit ’1 annas as compared to '09 annas, is a little higher, due to having to run the plant on certain days every week during the winter months for the benefit of the Imperial Airways. This necessitates considerable extra starting and stopping. Normally the plant is closed down daily between the hours of 9-30 a.m. and 3-30 p.m. from November to April each year but Imperial Airways l td. having installed a wireless station in Manamah in connection with the landing of their machines applied for current on the day (or days) on which a machine arrived. Although under no^ obligation to supply this, the government, in order to help the Imperial Airways as much as possible] agreed to run when required, which very often meantTwo or three days a week, due to the Air mails being late on account of bad weather. Public telephones.—The. government of Bahrain, in conjunction with the Manamah Municipality, decided to instal a telephone system in the town of Manamah, using a central exchange. This scheme has been carried out by the electrical department and at the end of 1351 twenty lines had been connected and two were in course of erection. The scheme has proved a great convenience and as time goes on, the local exchange will probably be linked with the Bahrain Petroleum Coy.’s camp, which is at the nearest point some fourteen miles distant. The Camp already has six internal telephones and will in time have many more. !29 £ 58,870 5 2 58,870 5 2 It is also hoped that' enough subscribers will be forthcoming in the town of Muharrak to warrant running a trunk line across the sea. Until now only two applications ha^ye been received from Muharrak. Two rates are available to subscribers, one a flat rate of Rs. 150 per annum and the other Rs. 45 per annum plus one anna a call of six minutes duration. The former is the most popular. \ Prospects for 1S52 .—Although it is difficult to make a forecast at pre sent, it can reasonably be assumed that wiring (with consequent additional load) will proceed, if not faster, at the present rate, during 1352. It is also hoped that the sale of appliances will increase. Should the economic situation become easier, then many more consumers will come forward. There are enough potential consumers in Manamah and Muharrak to make the undertaking a good paying proposition, but the universal cry is that they at present have no money. ! General .—The department carried out all the government car repairs as heretofore, and in addition to the wiring contracts in Manamah and Muharrak, carried out the wiring of the new offices, etc. of the Bahrain Petroleum Co. at the Jebel Dukhan and their telephone system. A durbar was held in Manamah during the month of Shawaal 1351, in honour of H. E. Shaikh Hamad and for three days the town was illumi nated some 700 e.stra lights being erected on public and private buildings. Bahrain Electric Supply—Profit and Loss. {End of year 1351.)

Customs. The following report has been provided by Mr. C. C. L. DcGrenier, the Director of Customs :— Report on the Customs and revenue collections for the year 1351 A . H. {6th May 1932 to 25th April 1933). In comparison with the Budget estimates the collections were: — Budget head. Estimated collections. Actual collection. Rs. Rs. Customs and Import Yard 6,57,000 6,41,952 Vehicle Licenses ..... 2,500 4,614 Pearling Licenses .... 35,000 40,260 Craft registrations . . . • 2,500 3,569 Miscellaneous (Tobacco Tax) . 3,000 4,491 7,00,000 5,94,886 Total deficiency Rs. 1,05,114. In regard to the above, the deficiency in the actual Customs receipts can be attributed partly to the world trade depression (which has now reached an acute stage), and partly to the local effects of several pearling seasons * oca ^ Taajirs have been unable to dispose of their stocks or to coHect the proceeds of their disposals. This may be partly their own fault, Qf ? j^ajirs, w o had been enjoying considerable prosperity were warned £hat in future prices would fall; but the warning does not seem to have been heeded, and consequently certain local Taajirs felt compelled to go as far Pans to sell their pearls, where they met with varying success. Thus there is a very definite lack of ready money available for general trading.33r Tims, the fall in the customs receipts is due to a decline in imports both in quantity and value. One interesting point to note is the degree to which, in the past year, Japanese goods of all kinds have entered the local markets. Apart from one or two local Jewish traders who import in small but steady quantities _ the superior Manchester cotton piece goods, practically all piece goods now ^ imported into Bahrain are of Japanese origin, bought by local traders through their Agents in Bombay; but this enterprise extends over, a wide range including cement, cycles and gramophones, and may go farther even to rice, motor cars and eggs. Also, Chinese cigarettes have made their appearance, as well as Russian piece goods, matches and sugar. The following comparison of the principal commodities imported should be of interest:— Commodity. Unit. Quantity. Year 1350 value A. V. Quantity. Year 1351 value A. V. Rs. Rs.

The marked decrease, however, in sugar and tea may be accounted for by a falhng-oft in the export trade in these two commodities, for this export trade accounted for the greater part of the imports, when the tea and sugar were exported hence to the mainland of Arabia, and. re-exported thence possibly to certain Persian ports, I am informed. It appears that an almost prohibitive import duty is imposed on tea and sugar, which sup- ported by a strict patrol of the sea-coast, makes this Persian import’trade favour of the bu ‘ ° f “T® this ^^ngement enures in U S S R in h „ vn '?

This list was compiled with the Adviser’s approval after very careful consideration, working upon the principle of doing nothing to increase the j cost to the public of food commodities. Later in the year, namely, 4th Ramadhan 1351 (corresponding with 31st December 1932) the rate of seven and-a-half per cent, upon these commodities was further increased to ten per cent., except upon alcoholic liquors and tobacco and its manufactured products, which were increased to fifteen per cent, ad valorem. In regard to these increases, which were made with considerable reluctance, it is good to note that they were accepted by the mercantile community without any comment except perhaps a little surprise that they had not been imposed earlier; and, indeed, at the present time the importers are expecting that the rate of ten per cent, ad valorem will be applied to imports of all kinds, as the necessity for raising revenue is quite understood. It is however interesting to remark that the only comment on this change of duty came from a British firm whose imports are quite unimport ant in value to the State, and, even so, such imports are for certain ‘permitted’ persons in a commodity which is admitted only by a special concession by H. E. the Ruler. The comment resolved itself into the sug gestion that imports whose invoices were dated prior to the date of the change in duty should be admitted at the prior existing rates, accompanied with the curiously ingenuous statement that such was the custom according to ‘international law’! n These changes in the rates of import duty explain, why the total collections, above, of duty from steamers’ cargoes is larger in 1351 than in 1350; and same may be analysed thusT Collections at per cent. 5 10 15 Rs. R S . 2,50,346 23,833 16,118 4,103 2,94,400 —35 If, however, the collections for the year 1351 had been all at the flat rate of five per cent, ad valorem, this item of Rs. 2,94,400 would have been Rs. 2,75.662, a difference of Rs. 18,738 and it is this figure which enables one to form a just comparison between the two years. It will be remembered that the sate of 7J per cent, was in force for nine months, and the rates of ten per cent, and fifteen per cent, were in force for three months only; and they have produced an increase in the receipts of Rs. 18,738 only, a fact which seems to justify the expectation that the ten per cent, rata might with fairness be applied to all imports 'except tobacco, etc., and alcoholic liquors, which I suggest could easily bear a duty of 25 per cent, ad valorem. The changes in the rates of duty, however, have had a more marked effect in the case of collections upon postal parcels; the sum of Rs. 16,519 is made up thus : — Collections at per cent. Rs. 5 2,066 8,500 10 5,903 15 50 16,519 If the flat rate of five per cent, had been maintained, this figure would have amounted to Rs. 10,702 only; but so marked a difference is to be expected, since articles of the luxury type are more likely to come here as parcels than as general cargo, although the quantity of parcels have con siderably decreased in the past year. The same remark may justly apply to passengers’ baggage but it is not quite so pleasing to see a decrease in the collections for Export Duty which is collected upon dates and pearl shells. The inference is that less dates were exported, which was to be expected, as people in general, espe cially the poor, are consuming more dates and fish and much less imported meat than formerly. The decrease in the Import Yard collections is consistent with the decrease in the quantity of cargo imported. It will be remembered that in the year 1350 a system of “refunds” was initiated, under which the local importer was permitted to exercise an option in regard to his import, as to whether: or not be might re-export it to the mainland ports of Arabia, on similar lines with the R. E. system, which is regulated by High Authority. Having duly proved the re-export of the import, the impoi^ter was granted a refund of the difference between the amount of duty pre-paid and two per cent, ad-valorem,. I am glad to report that the working of this ‘optional’ system (as it became known) was very much appreciated by the merchants and it was extensively used especially by the Hindu community who otherwise were greatly hampered in their mainland trade. Hnfortunately for the Customs however the work of checking the returns and making the refunds developed so consi- deramy as to become a very definite and equally unremunerative section of the office work; and to keep the refunds uptodate has proved a difficult task especially when one remembers that the Customs staff is now reduced to a minimum. In view of this position, I have changed the working of the system so that the importer may exercise his option as before but oav only two per cent, db initio; and it is hoped that this adjustment will very considerably reduce the amount of office work involved in making refunds Consequently there appears above a new heading named “Re-Export” Dutv which records the results of this recent adjustment. It might not be out of place here to mention that all these refunds were made by cheoue so that (1) records of the transactions might be more efficiently kept than bv SfKKKS 2 ” 1 “ l » «**»36 The usefulness of this optional system to the mercantile community is demonstrated by the fact that the old R. E. system has now completely fallen into disuse; and there is no doubt at all in my mind that the merchants trading with the mainland are quite satisfied with the existing system in Bahrain and are content to carry on with it, in preference to residing upon the mainland. I The geographical position of the State of Bahrain lends itself to the development of a transit trade, which* is effected by the oncarrying of steamers’ cargoes to the mainland by native craft; and in my opinion it is most desirable to encourage this trade as much as possible, especially as this oncarrying creates so much work for local native craft and motor launches; its advantage to the merchant is the facility for despatching small quanti ties of goods to the mainland as occasion offers, rather than the shipment there direct from India of large quantities, which could only be done by firms having large capital and extensive storage capacity on the mainland. For this reason I believe that any effort at bringing cargo direct from India W to a mainland port will not prove successful in the long run; and I would here remark that the recent decision of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., at Abadan to send their small steamer ‘Khuzistan’ to the mainland ports to sell oil, etc., is an error; since the Company will not sell any more oil than it does at present by transhipment in Bahrain, but, on the other hand will expose its steamer to extra working expense, and take away some employ ment from some mainland and local native craft. In my report for 1350, I alluded to the difficult position existing here arising from the question of the direct transhipment of cargo in this port., The position remained of minor importance for several years until several factors; mainly the growing self-consciousness of the Nejdy merchants, the-high freight rates charged by the B. I. S, N. Co., Ltd. (which com pany has practically the monopoly of the India-Persian Gulf cargo traffic) and the falling prices of Indian commodities notably cereals made the Nejdy merchants closely consider the amount of the expenses they were paying, in view of the general business depression, on the cereals taken hence to the mainland ports. These expenses included the shipping expenses from India and the Bahrain expenses on re-export. In Bahrain the rate of Khanchia per bag had been fixed at three annas; but after carefully considering the position the Bahrain govern ment decided to reduce this rate in regard to re-exported bag cargo to Rs. 6 per hundred bags. An attempt to force down the B. I. rates had previously been made by a local Hindu merchant, who had brought here a ship-load of rice and sugar from Calcutta in a Norwegian craft; but this action did not lead to a general permanent reduction of freight rates by the Company. Probably with this fact in mind, a Karachi shipper of rice (whose shipments are sold on the mainland on a commission basis only) demanded special rates from the B. I. S. N. Co., Ltd., under; the threat that he would despatch all future shipments by native craft direct to the main land, or possibly charter a special steamer for his own purchases. After considerable discussion and correspondence it was decided to affirm the right of the Bahrain government to collect two per cent, ad valorem upon all cargo transhipped within the port limits; and the B. I. S. N. Co., made a gesture by reducing its freight rate temporarily in order- to compete with a second special shipment of cargo from Calcutta to Bahrain arranged by above Hindu merchant. This shipment came forward on S.S. “Fagervick” a Norwegian vessel which arrived here on 1st Raba al Thany 1351 (3id August 1932), with 24,176 packages of rice tea and coffee. In the meanwhile the Karachi shipper, Hajy Hassan bin Murzook. had promised H. B. M.’s Political Agent that he would make no direct shipments thence to the mainland of Arabia in consideration of a reduc tion in the freight rate, and also if the Bahrain government would38 I therefore consider myself justified in reporting that the mainland trade will proceed steadily as long as there is any such trade to be done, the greatest factor in its favour being the regular weekly calling here of the upmail steamers, thus enabling the merchants concerned to replenish their stocks regularly at a saving of considerable sums in interest payable on ovec due accounts in India if such consignments w 7 ere to come foward irregularly by sailing craft; another factor is the local feeling of security ^ in dealing with the Bahrain customs. Thus, during the past year, the 2 | per cent, duty so collected has amounted to Its. 13,652. The saving point is; how long will such transit trade continue? This is doubtful, for one of the main reasons for the transhipment trade in rice, and especially in piece-goods, was that the rates of Import Duty levied on the mainland were very much less than the rates of Import Duty levied at Jeddah, the greatest port in the Kingdom of Saudia. It appears to be j cheaper to bring goods from India to Arabia via Bahrain than to import | them via Jeddah; and this* fact has created a falling oh in the imports into j Jeddah with a corresponding outcry from the interested merchants there. 1 I understand now that H. M. King Abdulaziz ibn Saud has ordered the rates of Import Duty on the eastern ports of his realm to be similar to those in force at Jeddah on the west, with the exception of Japanese goods, which are said to be subject to a distinctive high rate of Import Duty. r I his action appears to be due to the activity of Shaikh Muhammad Tawil, who in the Shareefian regime, used to be the Collector of Customs in Jeddah, and who maintains an agent in Bahrain to deal with his busi ness here, this latter carrying on an Import-transit business in his own name. ^ It now remains to be seen how these new rates of Import Duty will affect the transit trade via Bahrain to the mainland. This year, 1351, is the second one in wdiich the export to Bahrain from Persia of grain in. bulk has failed. It is said that the reason for this was the lack of rain in Persia and possibly the customs restrictions there upon exports; but the export thence of sheep and goats to this State still continues, though not in so large a quantity as formerly. The col lections upon live-stock for the year 1350 were Rs. 2,468 but in 1351 these amounted to Rs. 1,952 only. In the year 1350, 1,571 native craft visited this port of which 633 - came from Persia; while in 1351, 1,573 native craft came here of which only 445 were from Persia. The export trade in tea and sugar has cor respondingly languished: and in this trade a steady part was taken by the big sailing motor craft of the Shaikh of Tibben, which plied regularly between that port and Bahrain. Unfortunately for the Shaikh durino* last winter his craft was burnt at sea and became a total loss, and it has not yet been replaced. In place of the Persian wheat, there has come forward a steadily in creasing quantity of wheat from Iraq, which is cheaper than Indian rough wheat, and consequently the import of this latter commodity has also ceased. Of the 1,573 native craft which visited this port last year 50 craft camp from Kuwait, 196 craft came from Iraq, 47 craft came from India, 16 craft came from Africa, 140 craft came from Oman, 679 craft came from Arabian mainland, 445 craft came from Persia. Local Craft^—-At the end of the year 1351, there were registered Bahrain 1,217 railing craft and 63 motor launches. This figure inch., 458 sailing craft registered for pearling most of which are expected to39 out this season, though there have been a number of sales of craft to foreign ports since the last Quffal. The boat-building industry is languishing for want of orders for new craft; and this is to be expected after several poor pearling seasons. In 1342 there were 617 craft registered for pearling. For last year’s pearling season 275 local craft were registered as work ing on the “Khammos” system; and the majority of these did not pay their license' dues before the Kakbah, but were permitted by the Deputy Ruler to give “sanad” for payment of the dues after several journeys out to the banks; two journeys were in fact stipulated, but the licensees interpreted this to mean that they might pay as and when they chose. This loose arrangement was very unsatisfactory, and created considerable unnecessary difficulty in the collection of the dues. So, as each sanad fell due for payment I proceeded to impound the craft concerned until payment; and I am glad to report that I collected all the pearling license fees due to the State without having recourse to the courts at all. The permission to give sanad, however, has created an unfortunate precedent, which I fear will be resorted to again this year with its conse quent trouble in collecting the dues which ought to have been prepaid before the Rebba. [ Harbour lights .—The institution of the larg 3 light on the customs pier at Manamali has worthily served its purpose, and it is admitted to be of assistance to craft entering oi? leaving the port at or aftsr sunset. With this experience in mind, the oil lamp at the mast head at the Maharaq custom house was replaced with an hundred-watt white electric light; and this light has proved to be of even greater benefit both to steamers and native craft than was at fiijst hoped, for its range of vision is not inter rupted by the date palms at Galalee, so that it can be distinguished at some distance beyond the outer (white) buoy. I am informed that the light is especially useful to the pearling fleets; so for that reason it is proposed to light it throughout the season instead of (as at present) half the month, and when steamers are expected or in port.j The Manamah light ranks in the Admiralty sailing directions as an ‘occasional’ light, i.e., one to be lighted upon request; and since Bahrain is not in the direct line of Gulf traffic, it is well that it should remain so; but I understand from navigating officers, and particularly from H. M. S. “Ormonde” that the existence of the two lights is a very definite help to ships entering the port after sunset in making a suitable anchorage. The only other urgent improvement in the lighting of the port needed at present is the altering of the West Spit Buoy into a lighted buoy, and pre ferably a flash light.) A suggestion has been made that a light should be put upon the Portuguese Fort; but I do not approve of this at present, as there are so many practical difficulties in the way of its efficient maintenance that it really would not be prudent to undertake the responsibility for such a light.) It has sometimes been urged that the old beacon built upon the Ras Zarwan by Mirza Ismail (the first B. I. S. N. Coy.’s agent in Bahrain) and thus popularly known as the ‘Gray Paul’ beacon, should be lit, the reason being that this beacon, and the West Spit buoy and the Manamah Pier light are in transit, and consequently this fact would enable a steamer at night quite readily to find a safe anchorage. But there is po need to urge this point since not five per cent, of the steamers using this port enter it at night, and the suggestion is of very minor importance compared wdth the need for a lighted West Spit Buoy.) It is however a fact that an unofficial light has been put upon this beacon bv the local B. I. S. N. Coy.’s agents on stormy nights to assist their lighters in making the Customs Pier, but the beacon was rebuilt by the Bahrain Government, and somewhat improved.40 r General .—It has to be remembered that while the total of the receipts for the past year has decreased, the quantity of work to be done has increas ed, especially clerical work in connection with refunds and statistics which have now reached a point of reasonable efficiency; there is actually as much clerical woi^k in collecting a small amount of money as a large one. It may perhaps be said that since the collections have decreased, the staff should also decrease; but I suggest that this is a wrong point of view to ^ take, and it is better to keep together a trained staff, although its cost may increase a little each year owing to the annual increments in pay. It will be remembered that last year, all pay was cut by ten per cent./but I will not suggest this as a matter; of merit, since it will be seen from above how the cost of the prime commodities has fallen so sharply, that actually the present rates of pay have a much larger purchasing power locally than three years ago.f j Thus although the Customs receipts have fallen sharply, j^et the cost of living has fallen quite as sharply; and if expenses are made to fall con sistently, I suggest that the outlook for the future should not be too pessimistic. General. Shaikk Khalaf . —During last summer Shaikh Khalaf left Bahrain on a lengthy visit to Kathemain where some of his family are living. Before he left he was sued in the Bahrain Court by a local pearl merchant who proved a claim against him for Rs. 14,000. The Court insisted upon Shaikh Khalaf handing over title deeds for certain of his property in Manamah sufficient to settle the claim, before leaving thg country. It is not known when or whether he proposes to return. 1 Iraqi Agitator (Syed Saleh bin Syed Mehdi).—A week or two before the death of Shaikh Isa a young Shia Iraqi named Syed Saleh bin Sved Mehdi described on his passport as a student, arrived in Bahrain from Kuwait where he was said to have been the guest of the Ruler. He stayed r/r 0ne . ^ ^ Shaikh Hamad and then became the guest of Khan Saheb 1 usuf Kanoo. He was invited to address the Manamah club which is ostensibly now political. He made a long speech in which he referred to the English as wolves and the people of Bahrain a§ their prey. A er Shaikh Isa s death a large meeting was held under the auspices of tlie club m Khan oaheb Vusuf Kanoo’s building on the sea road. Various people spoke including school masters and several young men recited no-ms commemorating the lata Ruler. Syed Saleh bin Syed Mehdi also spoke. His s P^ c h was violently anti-English and his sentiments were not even disguised by metaphor He stated among other things, that Jesus Christ had been crucified by the Jews, but Shaikh Isa had been morally cruci fied by the English. His speech was applauded by some of the audience including several of H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s nephews. On the following morning he was taken out to the mail boat which happened to be in the harbour and provided with a free ticket to another port. , + ^en he was in Bahrain he openly abused not only the Government but both the Sunni and the Shia Qadis. It is said that this individual was recently imprisoned in Haq for having made a seditious speech in'the presence of His Majesty King Faizal. Dawasir-The town of Budeya is gradually being re-inhabited by members of the Dawasir tribe who returned one by one from Dhammam Ahmed bin Abdullah, the son of the late Shaikh of the Dawasirs makes e\ery effort to prevent his followers from returning to Bahrain Unfor Innately owing to his influence with Shaikh bin Jeloi, several times during e yeai he has been able aeJiberately to cause misunderstandings between the Governor of Hassah and the Ruler of Bahrain. ! *41 Miscellaneous —Local Industries. J Boat building ,—The slump in the pearl trade has affected the boat building industiy very severely. Some years ago this was a thriving trade and Bahrain built motor launches and sailing craft were exported to various Gulf ports. The decline in boat building is partly due to there being so many second hand pearling boats for sale at abnormally low prices. Sail making .—Sailcloth is made on hand looms in two or three villages in the neighbourhood of Budeya. This trade still continues but is less profitable than it used to be owing to the fall in the cost of sailcloth. It was found that very serviceable “Dhurries” could be made locally at a lower price than those previously imported from India. About 150 of these ^Dhurries” were recently made locally for the Bahrain Police. Eastern Bank .—The new Eastern Bank was opened on 25th June 19132 H. E. Shaikh Hamad and a number of local merchants and notables attended the opening. The new Bank was built by an Iraqi contractor, it occupies a site on the sea-side of the sea road west of the Customs Pier and is built of stone and cement./ GIPD— L277(c)F&amp;PD—7-11-33—25&lt;/-V Tfelegram R* No.2112* Dated 27th August 1933.

With reference to our conversation on the subject of the financial future of Bahrain. The State having enjoyed a good many years of prosperity is now- -like practically every other country in the world - faced with difficult times ahead. its income depends largely on its ad valorem customs dues, and both the bulk of its imports, and their value, have decreased. The pearl trade, which is by far the State’s most im- -portant means of support, has during the last two or three years much diminished: catches have been poor, and even when pearls are found there is no market for them. Nor is there much prospect of an improvement in the world pearl market for some years to come. The last State budget did not balance, and an encroachment had to be made into the state’s reserves: in other words the State has begun to live on its capital. 2. ^n these circumstances we were agreed that the finances of the State were now of special concern to us, for the obvious reason that - apart from our trade and commercial interests in the island - should the State fall into serious financial difficulties, it would pre- -sumably be to His i^Jesty’s S-overnment that it would turn for assistance. 1 therefore considered that it would...would fte advisalDle, in whicti opinion you concurred, for a general principle to 'be placed on record that before the State undertakes any scheme involving large financial expenditure the Financial Adviser should consult the Political Agent, hy letting the latter have a detailed statement of the scheme in question. It is hardly necessary for me to explain that I do not make this suggestion with any idea of hampering the Financial Adviser. On the contrary I wish to assist him in his difficult task, which he has carried out with ability, to the best of my power. 3* I take this opportunity of quoting the two test questions which Sir Edward ^ilton Young set out in his economic report on ’Iraq when he was called in to assist the government of that country in its finan- -cial difficulties. 'Is this (i.e. the scheme proposed) necessary for the maintenance of order and security ? If not, is it going to increase the productivity of the country ? Expenditure which cannot pass these tests is for 'Iraq extravagant.’* I think the same test might well be applied to any pro -jects in Bahrain, at all events until the financial conditions of the State shows considerable improvement I would be grateful if you would convey my views to the Financial Adviser.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported early in the year to the Government of India that in order to meet the deficit the Bahrein Government had proposed an increase in certain Customs duties to 7%$. Article IV of the Bahrein Convention of thethe 31st May, 1861, (sqg page 685 of Volume XIII of Eertsle^s Treaties) provides that the goods of British subjects shall be subject only to an ad valorem duty of but, owing to the urgent necessity of preserving the State 1 s solvency, the Government of India recommended that this departure from the provisions of the Convention should be ! agreed to as a temporary measure, on the understanding that the increase would apply to foreign as well as to British goods; and this recommendation was accepted. 3* Later reports from the Government of India, however, indicated that this temporary increase had not proved sufficient to alleviate the financial situation, and that it remained acute. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, after full examination of possible alternatives. urgedurged that the situation could only he satisfactorily dealt with if the limitation imposed by tijtt IV were temporarily withdrawn, 'fhe Crovernment of India endorsed this recommendation as a purely temporary measure subject to the safeguards (i) i that the goods of all British subjects shall be subject to no other or higher duties than those imposed on other goods of the same kind (ii) that the Political Resident shall be given four months^notice of any increase in the duties,above the rates at present permitted, in order that he may have the opportunity of making any ooservations that he may consider desirable. 4# No formal modification of the Convention has been made, but the Political Resident has addressed a letter to the Bahrein Government to the effect that approvalapproval Is given,as a temporary measure, to the withdrawal of the limitation imposed by Article IV of the 1861 Convention, subject to the safeguards mentioned above# 5. It may be added that it has been known for some months that the Bahrein Government were anxious to increase the tariff^ on luxury articles to 10$ and on tobacco and liquor to 15$ ad valorem, and in the special circumstances consent has been given to the waiver in the case of these increases of the four months 1 period of notice stipulated in the Political Residents letter.

(4) The economies already made will take effect more fully during the present financial year. * The most objectionable feature of the budget is the sum which still has to be expended on allowances for the ruling family. This item amounts to 55% of the total estimated revenue for 1932/33 and is more than ten times the amount budgeted for expenditure on education. It is to be noted that a full 10% cut has not been applied to these allowances owing to certain modifications made in the budget during the absence of Mr. Belgrave on leave (p.7). Apart from the financial Adviser’s covering letter (pp.2-3), passages of special interest in the report are:- pp. 6-8 Budget Estimates for 1932/33. p. 13 Indian Police - Commandant of Police, pp.14-17 The Government's attempt to regularise administration of estates, which resulted in a rather serious riot.

To The Hon t ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter lTo.6 09-S dated the 26th August 19 32 regarding the Annual Report of the Bahrain State. 2. It would appear that by lack of specific commendation in my forwarding letter I have conveyed an unfavourably impression of Mr.Belgra ve * s work during the past year. This was far from my intention and I would like to efface it, should such an impression have been created. r 3. The year may be aptly described as a financial ^ear guard action, in which the State suffered loss but retired in good order. Though less spectacular, a rear guard action calls for as much, if not greater, skill and pertinacity than ani advance, and in this rear guard action Mr.Belgrave has shown considerable ability and courage, he has to bear the brunt of any unpleasantness caused in making economies, and only those who have served in a semi-civilized State such as Bahrain can realise the many and diverse forms this unpl ea ss nt ne s sunpleasantness can take, and what pressure can be brought to bear by interested persons. Had Hr.Belgrave 1 s efforts been more ably seconded by Captain Parke, who officiated for him during his leave, the deficit would have been even smaller. 4. As regards the Muharraq extension. .tfhile officiating as Political Resident, Colonel Barrett informed me that a detailed critique of the State report was not required a nd the fo rwa rdi ng le t te r shoul d no t, the re fo re , be regarded as a complete resume. This was a capital expenditure and consequently had little bearing on the balancing of the budget. When the electric light was introduced in Is&amp;nama, it was found that many of its loudest supporters failed to take advantage of it, and this should have been a warning with regard to the liuharraq extension. The argument that the HLuharraq public had contributed to the main scheme has little weight, for the same argument applies to Hidd, Sana bis, and every other township that can be served, since the State balances were made from the customs revenue to which all the inhabitants of Bahrain contribute. Actually the LIuharraq Baladiya were unable to find their share of the capital cost and the State was obliged to lend it to them. 5. Audit is an essential feature of all Government accounts and also of all except the smallest business undertakings, in Bahrain each department does its own auditing and there the matter ends. it must be obvious that departments are unlikely to discover all their own errors, even if we suppose that all state servants are mo d el smodels of honesty. Mr. Hedgcock's first action in Muscat was to introduce an efficient auditor and he told me that he considered his services invaluable. I have the honour to be, ^»ir, four most obedient servant, Sd. G.G-Prio r. Political Agent,u 1 3 OCT 19327 CONFIDENTIAL. (i) Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 609-S. of 1932, dated the 26th August 1932. I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with my letter No. 1449, dated the 11th July 1931 [Serial No. (2) in File No. 73-N/31)], and to enclose herewith the correspondence noted below :— (1) Letter No. C/149 of 17th August 1932, from the Political Agent, Bahrain. ( 2 ) Report of the Bharain State for 1931, together with the new budget for 1932, by Mr. C. D. Belgrave, Financial Adviser to the Bahrain State. 2. The Political Agent was correct in his forecast that the present year's budget would not balance (page 8 of correspondence in File No. 73-N/31), but considering adverse conditions under which the Bahrain State has had to carry on the actual deficit of about Rs. 37,000 in a budget of about Rs. 832,000 is not alto gether unsatisfactory. The financial outlook is, however, far from bright for the reasons given by Captain Prior in paragraph 2 of his letter. 3. With regard to the possible loss of revenue on re-export to the mainland touched on in paragraph 3 of Captain Prior’s letter. This is still under considera tion {vide correspondence ending with India Office Printed Letter No. P.Z.4526/32, dated the 13th August 1932, copy sent to the Government of India) and it is to be hoped that a solution will be found 'which will avoid inflicting loss on Bahrain. 4. With regard to paragraph 4 of the Political Agent’s latter “ had the Muhar- raq scheme not been entered the loss per mensem would have been greater ”. It would appear that Captain Prior is referring to the total loss, including deprecia tion on the capital cost of the Muharraq extension, whereas Mr. Belgrave is refer ring only to the running expenses, excluding depreciation on the capital cost of the extension. Captain Prior’s criticisms of the Muharraq scheme, however, come rather late in the day. Mr. BeJgrave mentioned (pages 52—54 of correspondence in File No. 73-N/31) the Muharraq extension in last year’s report and Captain Prior, although of the opinion that the budget would not balance, had no criticisms to offer on the extension and commended Mr. Belgrave’s wurk generally : “ Indeed, it is largely due to his efforts that the situation is not worse than it is ” (page 10 of correspondence, ibid). Whatever may be thought of the extension from the financial point of view there were apparently good reasons in equity for extending the scheme to Muharraq, since, as pointed out by Mr. Belgrave, the Muharraq public, though contributing towards the general electric scheme, received no benefit whatever from it. 5. With regard to Captain Prior’s suggestion of an audit contained in the last paragraph of his letter. I do not see how this would reduce expenditure on com mercial undertakings. An audit merely ensures that money has been spent according to the intentions, i.e., the financial policy, of higher authority : it in no way controls the policy of the latter. What is needed, however, is a monthly statement from the Financial Adviser, Bahrain State, for the information of the Political Resident, who thus will be able from month to month to see how the State is progressing. As Officiating Political Resident in 1931 I initiated such reports in the Muscat State {vide paragraph 8 of my letter No. 487-S. dated the 1 st August 1932) (File No. F.-35-N/31). I have not considered it neces sary to continue to send these Muscat statements to Government, but they are of considerable use to me here and I will ask the Political Agent, Bahrain, to submit similar returns.

Without wishing to appear unduly depressing I must say that I do not consider the State is likely to receive the income estimated for in the 1351 budget, The customs dues are ad valorem and until world prices show an upward move there is no possibility of their increasing. Further Bahrain is almost entirely dependent on the peral trade for a living, and the last three years have exhausted the capital of almost all the merchants. This would, of course, reduce the pur chasing power of the State and nothing but a marked recovery in pearls will replace it. Of this recovery I see no signs at all. 3. Among factors which will have a bad effect on state revenues are the famine in South Persia which by depriving the minor Persian Ports of their usual exports of grain and livestock, has made it difficult for them to find the money to finance imports from Bahrain. Another cloud on the horizon is the possibility of loss of revenue from the re-export trade to the mainland, should Government force the State to adhere to the arrangements entered into 12 years ago. If this is done the British India Steam Navigation Company and other Companies will be forced by Nejdi merchants to give free overside delivery and Bahrain will be headed directly for bankruptcy. 4. I must confess I do not always understand the Adviser’s system of account ing or statements such as that on page 26 that “ had the Muharraq scheme not been entered the loss per mensem would have been greater Actually the ex tension of the electric light to Muharraq has been a most unfortunate business^ for it was undertaken without securing any undertaking from merchants resident there that they would connect themselves to the supply, and few have availed themselves of it. Since the capital expenditure was over Rs. 50,000 the State loses at least Rs. 2,000 a year in loss of interest, without any tangible advantage, for the current sold in Muharraq has barely covered the cost of generating and transmitting it there, owing to the very heavy transformer losses due to the distance involved. The Adviser would do well to consult the Political Agent more fully before under taking works of importance since he has little or no. experience of administration outside Bahrain. 5. The absence of any form of audit in the State is a grave defect and the- Adviser’s attention has been repeatedly drawn to it. Now that commercial under takings such as Electric Light Supply are under State Control, the need for an efficient audit is greater then ever. Sub-enclosure. Letter from the Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Persian Gulf, to His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain, No. 133/ S.F. of 1351, dated the 5th Safar 1351 (9th June 1932). I have the honour to forward for your information the annual report on the Bahrain State for 1350 (1931-32) together with the Budget for 1351 (1932-33) and notes on Revenue and Expenditure during 1350. This is the seventh Budget which I have had the honour to submit. Never in the last six years has there been so little to report. Owing to the urgent need for retrenchment the Government has carried out no new works either in the nature of public buildings or social services. In every direction the activity of the Government has been restricted owing to shortage of revenue. Owing to my absence on leave in England for six months during the Summer of 1350 some portions of the report are not as detailed as I should have liked them to be. The following is a summary of the financial results of the year 1350. At the beginning of the year the State held a balance of Rs. 1,13,856 apart from the Reserve fund of three lacs which is still, fortunately, intact. At the end of the year only Rs. 24,540 of this amount remained. In the Budget for 1350 it was estimated that the REVENUE would be Rs. 8,32,516. The actual REVENUE was only Rs. 7,96,601, a DEFICIT of Rs. 35,915 on the amount budgeted.3 The EXPENDITURE for 1350 was estimated in the Budget at Rs. 8,32,516. The actual EXPENDITURE was Rs. 8,33,527, only Rs. 1,011 more than the amount which was estimated. The total DEFICIT therefore on the year is :— ^ Rs. Deficit on the Revenue side .. . . .. .. .. 35,915 Deficit on the Expenditure .. .. .. ... .. 1,011 36,926 This amount was appropriated from the balance which was carried over from 1349. Besides this amount capital expenditure was incurred in connection with the Muharraq electric extension, and loan advanced to Bahrain Electric Supply amount ing to Rs. 52,390 wdiich was also paid from the Rs. 1,13,856 thus reducing the balance to Rs. 24,540.

Although a reduction of 10% was effected in the Civil List at the beginning of 1350 this item still absorbs more than 50% of the estimated revenue.. I The financial prospects for the new year are not encouraging. The pearl trade on which the whole of Bahrain depends, is in a desperate condition, last year there was very little market for pearls and once again the Bahrain merchants have accumulated another season’s catch most of which they were unable to sell. By means of drastic economies and some new taxation the new Budget has | been balanced, but it allows for no margin whatever and if the bulk of imported j cargo diminishes, as is possible, the measures which have been adopted to balance j the Budget on the Revenue side will fail to produce the required effect. In one direction only there is a possibility of increased revenue, but this possi bility is very problematical If the Bahrain Petroleum Co. should succeed in finding a commercially negotiable quantity of oil it might be reasonably hoped that the j Royalty payable by the Company to the State would be sufficient to relieve it from I its present financial depression. 47 M Notes on Budget for 1351 [(1932-33)].

The saving is small as the economies will not become effective until after the middle of the year and in the meantime allowance has to be made for additoinal local police who are being trained preparatory to taking over the duties from the Indian Force, and also for passages and leave pay for the Indians. Government departments .— In these departments a saving of Rs. 14,000 has been achieved by means of reduction of staff and a 10 % cut on all salaries and also by the fact that it happens that during 1350 none of the senior officials are due for leave. Education .— A saving of Rs. 10,000 is to be effected by a cut in salaries, various economies and the decision to close one of the two boys’ schools in Manama and combine the two in one building, the Jaffaria school, which will enable the girls’ school to be moved into what is now the Sunni school building. This arrangement is to come into force at the beginning of the school term. It is likely to cause some disturbance. Medical. —A rent of Rs. 4,800 per annum is paid to H. E. Shaikh Hamad for the site of the Quarantine camp which is leased from him. Municipalities. —A grant of Rs. 1,000 per month is made to each of the Munici pal councils. The last four items have been reduced to the very lowest possible amount. The Rs. 2,000 is intended to cover the government’s contribution towards loss during the year in the electric scheme, assuming that the revenue does not cover the running cost. Under Agriculture a sufficient amount has been provided to pay the salary of the Agriculturist for three months and also for the upkeep of the Palace garden. There is a small surplus under this heading. The Agriculturist has been given pro visional notice and failing a decided improvement in the financial position he will not return to Bahrain after taking his leave in the summer. Public works, etc. —This includes repairs to the pier, which are necessary, and upkeep of Government buildings, roads and bridges. As no money is available it has been impossible to allow for any unforeseen expenditure and only the essentially necessary expenditure has been budgeted for.

The state of this industry, the mainstay of Bahrain, has gone from bad to worse, the condition of the pearl market is deplorable and there is hardly a single big merchant or nakhuda who is not in financial difficulties. According to “La Perle ” which is the official periodical of the pearl and pre cious stone industry in Paris, the catch during the last season was “ One quarter or one fifth of 1930 which was already smallThe article which I quote also states that only one third of the boats that went out in 1930 were fishing in 1931 and the quality and size of the pearls was inferior to the previous season. It is difficult for me to obtain an accurate estimate of the value of the season’s pearls as they are not subject to customs valuation. About half the nakhudas employ the official diving clerks to make their accounts and from these accounts I can form a somewhat rough estimate of the annual production, assuming that the rest of the boats whose accounts are made independently, and which I have had no opportunity of examining, obtained a proportionate amount of pearls.11 It must be remembered that these values are the amounts paid by the land nakhudas or Tajars, to the sea nakhudas and by the time the pearls reach the final purchaser in Bahrain they may have changed hands many times and will certainly have increased very much in price. One known example of this was a pearl pro duced some years ago which was sold by the finder for Rs. 75,000 and eventually changed hands in Bahrain for two lacs. 1347j48 1348149 1349/50 (1929-30). (1930-31). (1931-32). Total number of boats registered as diving 538 509 504 from Bahrain. Total value of pearls found, i.e., original in 1348/49 Rs. 21,25,000 or, amount paid to the finders, Bahrain. £1,57,407. Ditto in 1349/50—Rs. 18,32,000 or, £1,35,703. According to these figures the difference between the 1348/49 and 1349/ 50 seasons was comparatively small but the production during these last two sea sons respectively was less than half the season of 1347/48. In the total weight of the pearls there was very little difference between the last season and the one before, but during the last season fewer large pearls were found. The five or six largest pearls found during the last season weighed between 17 to 20 chows each. Selaf and Tesquam advances. —The Tesquam after the last season was settled as usual by a public meeting of pearl merchants and nakhudas at Rs. 30 for a diver and Rs. 25 for a puller. This abnormally low amount raised no protest as the financial condition of the pearl industry is now thoroughly well known. At the end of the year a similar meeting was held to decide upon the Selaf which was fixed at the same amount as the Tesquam with the additional payment of Rs. 15 to divers and pullers alike at the “ Kharjieh ” which is the interval during the last quarter of the season when the boats come ashore for five days. It is unlikely that there will be any commotion in connection with the Selaf. Only a few years ago the advances at Selaf were Rs. 180 and Rs. 150 and before the amounts were controlled by Government divers were in some cases advanced five or six hundred rupees at Selaf of Tesquam. Bankrupt Nakhudas — Istofa .—An unusually large number of Nakhudas have become bankrupt this year and their boats and divers have been taken over by their Tajars. These bankruptcy proceedings are in reality cases between Na- khuda and Tajar and are dealt with according to diving laws, not according to Shera or commercial law. When a Nakhuda has become deeply in debt to his Tajar the Tajar very frequently refuses to lend him any more money to equip his boat and give advances to the divers, the Tajar has then the right to close his account with the Nakhuda taking over his boats at a valuation which is assessed by a committee, and completing the amount of his claim by taking over divers accord ing to the debts which they have against them in their books. According to custom the Tajar has no right to take over any of the Nakhuda’s property except boats and divers. But during the last two or three years, owing to the slump in the pearl trade, conditions which have existed from time immemorial have begun to change. Be cause divers are no longer regarded as slaves their value as a transferable commodity has decreased. Tajars find that to take over half a lac worth of divers is not as advantageous as it used to be. Under the present law if a diver dies his children cannot be made responsible for his debt, as they used to be, and he cannot be used as a labourer in house or garden, during the off-season, as was previously the custom. Partly owing to this and partly owing to the bad times a practice has crept in bv which Tajars only advance money to their nakhudas if the nakhuda gives mort gages for the amount on his house or garden property in Bahrain. The nakhuda’s divers and boats used to be sufficient security for the Tajar who financed him. Now they are not. Khammamis and Selafieh .—Every year the number of boats diving on Kham- mas system is increasing. This is owing to difficulty that nakhudas have in obtain-ing capital for making advances. The increase of the Khammamis is advantageous to the divers themselves who, as they receive no advance from a Tajar, are not bound to sell their pearls to any particular person, and having more freedom they can get a fairer sale for what they find. Divers’ debts. —With the exception of about a dozen boats all the divers last season on the Selafieh system increased their debts and received no profits out of the season. The Khammamis, who do not take regular advances, made very small profits. At the same time it appears that most of the pearls of the 1350 season were sold and the large stocks winch are still held by so many of the Bahrain merchants are those obained two or three years ago which they are unwilling to part with at much less than they originally paid for them. Foreign buyers. —Very few foreign buyers came to Bahrain during 1350, those who came included Mr. Pack, a representative of Dr. Bienenfield and one Indian buyer who purchased comparatively a large amount. Mr. Bosenthal and Shaikh Mohomed Ali Zainal did not visit Bahrain although they came to Bombay. At the end of the season, as usual, most of the Bahrain merchants went down to ; Bombay, following the foreign buyers, but they were unable to sell. During the j year two Bahrain merchants, Jasim Kanoo, and the son of Mohomed bin Hindi went with their goods to Paris but they also found no market, partly owing to the pearls not having been bored. Prospects for 1351. —The prospects for the new season are not encouraging. In spite of th low Selaf most oi the Nakhudas declare that they have no money to equip their boats. The Khanchieh, a preliminary diving season lasting not more than a month, has produced very disappointing results both in quality and quantity. It is generally considered as a reliable forcast of the main seaosn. It is possible though that the small catch may be partly accounted for by the weather being un favourable during about half of the time, another explanation is that the divers themselves are very weak as they have had to exist on such meagre rations during the year. If this is true, the prospect for the new season is depressing. Police and Public security. Stength of Police at end of 1350 [1931—32]. Indian Police .. 44 Arab police 78 122 mem Armed Naturs under the Amirs .. 114 men. No. of police prosecutions during the year 1350 .. 591 Public security. —The state of public security remains satisfactory and it has been possible to subst tute armed naturs at Rafaa in place of the section of Indian Police who were previously posted there, this is partly owing to the fact that the young Amir of Rafaa is one of the most capable and active members of the Ruling Family. During the year one case of murder was dealt with by the Police. Owing to his generally unsatisfactory conduct especially during the recent strike the Amir of Muharraq has been dismissed and the Amir of Manama has been trans- feir d to Muharraq, his work in Manama is being carried out by his second in command. The condition of things in the town of Hedd requires some attention and when funds permit and a suitable man is found it is proposed to appoint an Amir there. At present one section of Police is stationed at Hedd. Liquor. —The use, sale or manufacture of liquor in Bahrain is and always has been, strictly forbidden except to those persons who are granted special permits by H. B. M.’s Political Agent. Recently there has been a very serious increase in the number of Arabs who have taken to drinking liquor which is secretly manufac tured. The w’orst offenders are certain members of the Kholifah family. Owing to their highly placed position, and because they drink in their own houses it is difficult for the Police to take action against them. Persons who are caught drink ing or distilling arrak are severely dealt wdth but undoubtedly a number of these people avoid detection. There is a feeling among a number of the younger and would-be progressive Arabs, who have travelled abroad, that the restrictions on drink should be withdrawn but on this subject Shaikh Hamad has very strong views.13 D Indian Police. The 44 Indian Police complete their agreements in about six months from the end of the year, and it is not proposed to renew their contracts. ney arc being substituted by locally enlisted police who are very much less expen sive and altogether more suitable for police work. The Arab police are a mixed orce and include Persians, mainland Arabs, Yemanis and Negroes. There are at presen ^ m ee sections of recruits at diflerent stages of training and their progress is very satisfactory, although on ceremonial occasions they will never be able to com pare with the Punjabis who have had many years service in the Indian Army. Commandant of Police.—For reasons of economy it was decided not to renew e agreement of Captain L. S. Parke, Commandant of Police and Assistant Adviser, on the completion of his contract which terminates in September 1932. Captain Parke proceeded on leave on 13th April having served as Commandant for six years. Ad\dser leantmie ^ ° f ^ Commandant of PoIice wil1 be carried out by the Foreign 'prostitutes and beggars. —A large number of foreign prostitutes and beggars were repatriated to the ports from which they came during the year.

It should be impossible for cases to be handed on from court to court on the application of one of the parties. It often happens now that the Beh- rain court settles a case, the defendent applies to H. E. Shaikh Hamad for its transfer to the Majlis Tajara, this is done, but the party is dissatisfied with the verdict and then applies for a transfer to one of the Shera courts, and then it sometimes happens that the case is finally returned to the Bahrain Court. This is an undignified, unlawful and unsuitable procedure. Government’s attempt to regularise administration of estates. Preliminary. —The complete lack of supervision either by the Government or even the Shera over estates of widows, minors and orphans has during recent years been the subject of much criticism in Bahrain. It is a notorious fact that this atti tude of indifference on the part of the Government has led to innumerable instances of mis-appropriation by executors of wills and by persons appointed by wills or by the Kadis to administer estates of deceased persons. About six years ago Major Daly, then Political Officer, attempted to introduce certain reforms in this direction. He suceeded to some extent but when he left Bahrain opposition was organised, at that time mainly by the religious leaders, and the measures were withdrawn. Particular instances. —During the last year or two a number of cases have come before the Bahrain Court revealing a most unsatisfactory condition of affairs. Innumerable women and children have been robbed and cheated by persons who were supposed to be guarding their interests and administering their estates. In many cases the general public were aware of the facts but nobody considered it his duty to inform the court, and the people who were being robbed were incapable of complaining. It. is beyond the scope of this note to give particulars of all these cases but two or three instances are enough to show what has been happening. 1 . Ahmed bin Rashid al Naimi, the eldest brother of a young family whose father died was appointed by the Sunni Kadis as guardian of his young brothers and sisters and administrator of his deceased father’s estate which was worth about 4 | lacs. After two years one of the brothers came of age and filed a suit demanding to see the accounts of the administration. Out of the original estate there only remained about Rs. 28,000, the rest had “ gone into the sea,” it had been lost in diving speculation. 2 . Ali bin Beggar, a leading Muharraq pearl merchant was appointed by will as administrator of his brother’s estate of 12 lacs which consisted mostly of cash which was realised from pearls at the time of his death. For about eight years he kept the heirs quiet by annual payments, they being mostly women and children. During the slump on the pearl market he fell into financial difficulties, and became partly paralysed, the heirs made a case asking to see the accounts and it was found that practically nothing remained of his brother’s estate except two houses, all of it had disappeared in diving. The Court has taken possession of the title deeds of Ali bin Beggar’s own property which in normal times should be almost sufficient to satisfy the claims of the heirs. 3 . In another case two cousins, the Siadis, took possession of their uncles' estate and disregarding the other heirs, who were minors, enjoyed it for many years. Finally they quarelled over the spoils and the matter came before the Court. The original estate was valued at about 10 lacs. It was found that about three lacs of rupess were buried in an empty house in Muharraq. This money was taken over by the Government and put in the Bank. The shares of one of the heirs, a young man, and also his sister, were proved and the amount due to them was deposited in their name. The balance of the money and a large amount of property is now the subject matter of a lengthy and very complicated case which has been going on in the Bahrain Court for over two years. There are endless other cases of the same sort in which women and children and in one case a blind man have been swindled out of their rights by the adminis trators of the estate which they should inherit. Recent lean years have aggravated the conditions as in most cases the money was lost in diving, although it is strictly forbidden by Mohammedan law for the administrators of estates to speculate with the money which they are entrusted with in dangerous trade. They are permitted to invest in property or to use the money in trade as long as it is not of a dangerous15 nature and on condition that the administrator possesses an equivalent capital himself with which he can refund the estate if any disaster occurs, but in Bahrain the law of the Shera in this respect is disregarded. Government issues 'proclamation .—These cases, and many others, were reported by the Bahrain Court to Shaikh Hamad in detail. Various discussions and meetings took place, the Kadis were interviewed and a proclamation was composed somewhat on the lines of one previously issued by the Agency six months before which had been accepted by the public, without objection. It required that all wills should be regis tered by the Government before being executed and in the case of persons dying intestate the executor should not act before informing the Government. It specially mentioned that all matters pertaining to the Shera would be sent to the Kadis for disposal. Shaikh Hamad expressed himself unsually strongly in favour of the measure, Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman, who had repeatedly urged the necessity for legisla tion of this nature, gave it as their considered opinion that the proclamation would not cause any excitement or opposition. The Sunni Kadis agreed that it was ab solutely necessary, but wished the whole matter to be in their own hands. The Shia Kadis expressed unqualified approval. On December 26th, 1931, the procla mation was issued and was accepted by the public without comment. One or two reports were made of people who had died leaving property, but evidently the order was not universally obeyed. On 1 st February one of the Shia Kadis, Shaikh Ali bin Hassan, who had himself forwarded a public petition from the villages around him asking Government to intervene in the administration of estates, sent a message to say that he was having a great deal of trouble owing to the proclama tion. I visited him and found a crowd of about sixty people surrounding his house in a state of great excitement. The matter was explained to them and they went off to their homes apparently satisfied. This demonstration was organised by a neighbouring mulla who for some years has aspired to usurp the position of the official Kadi. In the meantime the Municipalities, Police arid Amirs were ordered to report any deaths. It is possible that they behaved somewffiat tactlessly in enquiring at houses where deaths had recently occurred. Public opposition.—’Dming the next few days certain individuals in Muharraq and Hedd held private meetings on the subject, and began to organise petitions and general opposition. A small section of the Manama Shias, one particular faction combined with the Arabs and entered into a solemn agreement that they would work together with the Arabs against the Government in this or any future question which appeared to require combined opposition. It is many years since an alliance of this nature was made by the Bahama with the Arabs. A number of local notables as well as the members of the Municipal councils were sent for by me and the matter was explained to them again. They all under stood and in most cases the younger and more progressive men expressed their approval, but the old conservative type of men did not. All of them said that the general public were opposed to the measure as they had heard various incorrect statements about it. It was afterwards ascertained that deliberate propaganda organised partly by the Sunni Kadis and by a certain faction in Muharraq and Hedd had been spread among the. illiterate and ignorant people who form the greater proportion of the population of those two towns. They were told that the Govern ment meant to take one quarter of the property of everyone who died ; that all women who died were to be medically examined ; that the families of people who died would be instantly turned out of their houses, and many other alarming stories. All this time Shaikh Hamad was out at Sakhir, but Shaikh Abdulla was in Muharraq. This was the time of the Resident’s visit to Hassa and there is no doubt that his presence here had the effect of postponing the disturbances which occurred later on. On 6 th February about thirty people mostly second-rate merchants from Muharraq and Hedd, went out to Sakhir and had an audience with Shaikh Hamad. They demanded that the proclamation should be cancelled. One of them in parti-16 cular spoke very violently on the subject. (Since then a case has been brought against him for misappropriating the property of some minors.) Somewhat to their surprise Shaikh Hamad replied to them very firmly telling them that the present condition of things was disgraceful and could not be allowed to continue. They left without obtaining any concession. Unfortunately this firm attitude was ^ not maintained ; it was suggested this same night that the proclamation should be taken down from the notice boards, secretly. However this was not done. The Eid of Fitr was on 8th February. Contrary to his usual custom Shaikh Hamad did not visit Muharraq on the second day of the Eid. In Manama condi tions were normal but in Muharraq the Eid was not celebrated in the ordinary way. The slaves who dance outside the houses of the Shaikhs, a great feature of this Eid, did not appear, they had been given orders not to come. Crowds collected on the pier waiting to make a demonstration, speeches were made by people in the Bazaars. Bazaars Close.—On the day after the Eid all the shops and offices in the Manama and Muharraq bazaars were closed. This demonstration originated in Muhar raq where some of the leading merchants set the example, others did the same and the small shopkeepers closed their stores as they were afraid that the bazaar might be looted. In Manama rumours were circulated that a mob of divers were coming over from Muharraq to raid the bazaar and certain of the Manama Shias closed their shops and persuaded their neighbours to do the same, the leading Arab and foreign merchants, seeing that most of the bazaar was closed, shut up their places of business and went home. On the next day none of the shops opened, including the meat, fish and veget- able markets. In the morning Shaikh Hamad sent for Shaikh Abdulla, Shaikh Rashid, myself and about half a dozen of the leading Arabs including Kanoo, Zayani Yousuf Fakhroo. At the same time, by chance, a number of the Khalifah Shaikhlings, nephews and sons of Shaikh Hamad, went out to Sakhir to call on him. Deputation at Sakhir Arabs arrived and discussed the matter for some time with Shaikh Hamad in a reasonable manner, some advocated a compro mise by which the Government could retire a little without giving in too much, others led by Yousuf Fakhroo demanded that the proclamation should be can- celled. Yusuf Kanoo spoke very strongly urging that the matter should be pushed t lough, Shaikh Sulman adopted the same line and Shaikh Abdulla maintained a neutral attitude. Everyone, including Shaikh Hamad, deplored the deliberate ies w hich had been told to the ignorant people and which were the main cause of the agitation. Suddenly, to everyone’s surprise a crowd of about thirty Manama Shias arriv ed in cars and came into the Majlis in a state of great excitement. They were mostly small shopkeepers and butchers, few of them were known to Shaikh Hamad personally. They were led by one Abdu Ali Alewat a second-rate merchant who had previously caused a great deal of trouble in connection with the schools, and two brothers, Aulad al Tajar notorious mischief-makers. They surrendoud Shaikh Hamad and began to shout at him and one of them produced a document which he claimed to be a petition from the whole Shia population of Bahrain. Abdu Ah made a long and very violent speech in which he attacked the Govenment, the ^lua Kadis, the schools, wakf department and other government institutions. In a very insolent manner, loudly applauded by his supporters, he demanded the immediate cancellation of the proclamation and a guarantee from the Govern ment that never in the future would such legislation be proposed. The Arabs who had^ been sent for by Shaikh Hamad endeavoured to calm the Bahama, except lousuf Fakhroo who expressed similar views, but politely. The youn^ Khalifah Shaikhs, who were sitting along the sides of the majlis, and Shaikh Hamad s followers who were also present, were obviously furious at the behaviour of the Bahama but as Shaikh Hamad made no attempt to call them to order it was impossible for anyone else to do so. Shaikh Hamad adopted a conciliatory and almost apologetic attitude. He made a speech, which was repeatedly interrupted, explaining the necessity for the proclamation. This had no effect. The talk went on for about an hour and then people divided themselves up into groups, some going outside and shouting to gether. One or two of the Arabs obviously encouraged the Bahama although17 throughout the meeting their attitude was respectful. Suddenly for no particular reason, the position seemed to change and in spite of my suggestion to Shaikh Hamad that he should not give a definite reply, he announced that the proclamation would be cancelled at once. The Shias however were not content with this, they demanded that the order cancelling the proclamation should be signed by not only Shaikh Hamad but myself and also the Political Agent. Shaikh Hamad did not agree to this. The meeting then broke up and the Shias returned to one of the matems in Manama where a great crowd was awaiting them. Proclamation cancelled .—Before noon on the same day the proclamation was removed. But the bazaars did not reopen. They remained closed the whole day, this time as a protest against the Agency because it had not also cancelled its pro clamation on the subject. On the next morning a large crowd collected at the Govenment office, led by Yusuf bakhroo and Abdu Ali Alewat. Many of the men carried knives and revol vers apparently with the idea of rescuing their leaders if they were arrested. I interviewed Yusuf Fakhroo, who protested that he was not responsible for the crowd, and gave him two copies of the new proclamation. A large deputation then visited Shaikh Hamad at Sakhir, but he refused to see them, however, he sealed the copies of the new Aalan. On the following day the Agency issued an amended notice and the bazaars opened again. This is the first time that a deliberately organised strike has taken place in Bahram, but I fear that it will not be the last time as it was such a complete success. n 9 rioting or fighting took place. The Police, although faced with a ■difficult situation, behaved with great discretion and loyalty, which is more than can be said for some others who should have supported the Shaikh. This disturbance, the most serious that has occurred since the Nejdi Persian / riots, was not a genuine expression of public opinion. It was an example of the / force of private intrigue and if the originators of the agitation had been dealt with , lumly at the beginning none of the trouble would have occurred. Land Department. Revenue in 1350 (1931-32) Expenditure Work done during the year. 1. Registrations of Sales .. 2. Exchanges .. 3. Gifts 4. Titles Rs. 8,080 18,513 246 13 30 286 Land Registration. There is an increase of 181 registrations over the previous year and an increase m the fees collected of almost three thousand rupees There is a slow but steady demand for the registration of titles, although this is not com pulsory. file public appreciate more and more the advantage of holding a Gov ernment title deed for their property. Owing to the trade depression the'value of land continues to decrease and the low prices obtained by sales have affected the receipts which the department receives from the registration of the sales The greatest decrease in land values has been in the case of date gardens; house pro- per ty in Manaman has not been affected so seriously. Besides registrations the Department has carried out a great deal of work in connection with court cases dealing with land, boundaries, water rights and divi sions of property among heirs A large proportion of the cases in the Bahrain Gourt are of this description and the compilation of reports and plans for the infor mation of the court take up a great deal of time and often necessitates several visits by the surveyors to distant parts of the islands JVIC517FDIS Land Settlement. —The large village of Kurzakhan and its gardens also MalcMeh and part of Sadad have been surveyed but during the summer no survey work was done as most of the surveyors v r ere on leave. Fish Traps —There aie along the coasts of the islands about a thousand or fifteen hundred fish traps some of which are rented for a few rupees per annum, others for over a thousand rupees per annum. During Shaikh Isa s regime members of the Khalifah family levied indiscriminate taxes on these traps which were ad jacent to territory over which they held feudal rights. Independent taxation was abolished when Shaikh Hamad became Ruler and the Civil wm “stitated It has been found that since then a number of people, particularly the Bin All A, ^os of Hedd built fish traps in the sea with no right. To preserve the rights of the Government along the foreshore and the sea a proclamation was issued ordering all owners o fish traps to register them in the Land Department and to pay 3 ' ^ 8 ', tration fee of Ke. 1 per annum. The registration is no proof of ownership but vv^ enable the G vernment in the future to examine the whole question. So far about 750 applications for registration have been received. In many cases the owners hold no documents for the fish traps, they will be required to prove their ownership by right of long tenure ; others are in possession of documents for one or two traps but have erected more than the number speci- fled on their documents, in such cases the ownership of the additional traps is not admitted by Government. , . The documents for fish traps usually mention boundaries which often include vast areas of sea and shoie. The Government has decided to consider that these boundaries are merely for the purpose of protecting the traps from being harmed by other traps in the 3 neighbourhood, and the areas within the boundaries are not the actual property of the owners of the traps. There has been some opposition to this interpretation of ownership, which is undoubtedly th&lt; ; w^re bv the Bin AH tribe of Hedd who also claim, quite unjustifiably, that they were once given a promise by Shaikh Isa that they should at all times be exempted from all and any form of taxation, therefore they resent having to pay Re. 1 per annurr on each fish trap. . . KhoMeJi Estates and feudal rights.-A proclamation was issued durmg the summer by Shaikh Hamad forbidding members of the Ruling Family to tel or mortgage their ancestral property. It was a necessary step as some of the Kha i had flready disposed of all their property at very low prices and having no longer any rents expected to be supported by Shaikh Hamad or the utate. ' Discussion took place between the Hon’ble the. Resident and Shaikh Hamad on the subject of the Ruling family’s rights over “ Sehat , i.e., whole villages and distri-ts in Bahrain gifted to them by Shaikh Isa. An agreement was arrived at which should protect the interests of the Bahama occupying land wnhm the “ Sehat ” and it was decided that the ancient family custom of the khalifah should behat ana ir 1 as m „ . f f the Ru l er should be valid only during &amp;SSSS 3 S &amp;£ S* —111 ,h, ..V,,..» Rul«. Mcr'aaaes on property.—A proclamation was issued after discussions with re- Fn possession of a Government title deed for the mortgaged property. Public Works. Expenditure Rs. 15,522-11-3.19 courses laid with cement, on which the Electric light poles carrying the cable to Maharraq were erected. The southern wall of the road was extended some distance and a little filling in was done. It is unfortunate that the Government at the moment has no available funds for the Sea Road as the price of stone is abnormally low and at the present rate the whole road could be filled in for an amount which is roughly estimated at two lacs whereas a few years ago it would have cost more than double this amount. No other work of any importance was carried out with the exception of repairs to Government buildings, bridges and roads. Owing to the work done by the Bahrain Petroleum Company with a road scraper on the Manama Rafa road the Government has been saved the expense of its upkeep and the result is most satisfactory. Education. There is very little to report on this subject. The schools, with the excep tion of the Shia School in Manama are flourishing and well attended and the year has passed without any serious disturbances such as occurred in 1349. Eight schools now exist out of which two are for girls and the others are for boys, the total average attendance is 560 boys and 170 girls, but the attendance varies according to the time of the year. The two school councils, Sunni and Shia, who were supposed to assist the Gov ernment in matters concerning education but who actually impeded it on every possible occasion, have practically ceased to exist. The period for w hich they were elected has terminated and it is not proposed to revive their activities. The ad ministration of the schools is in the hands of Shikh Abdulla bin Isa assisted by the Inspector of Education, the latter being responsible for the routine and interior management of the schools. The Manama Shia School is the only one which is not doing well, the attendance of Shias is very small although there are 20 or 30 Arab Sunnis going regularly to the school. The reason for this is the incessant quarrels between the various Shia factions in Manamah and also the feeling among the Shias that the school should not be subject to supervision by the Sunni Inspector of Education. As the Gov ernment of Bahrain is Sunni this attitude is ridiculous but unfortunately it has had the effect of reducing the attendance to about forty or fifty boys in a school which w ill hold 150 scholars. Encouragement has been given to the schools owing to the fact that the Gov- ernment when appointing young men in the position of clerks or to any vacancies that occur in the Government service invariably selects candidates who have been locally educated and who have obtained leaving Certificates from the schools. Enthusiasm for games, especially for football, continues to increase and matches are played between the various schools. This keenness for games among the young men in Bahrain has only developed during the last few years. It has now become a definite part of life in Bahrain in spite of the fact that many of the older generation regard it as dangerous and unnecessary and altogether undesirable, because, as they say, they never used to play such games themselves. Manamah Municipality. Rs. Revenue during 1350 (1931-32) .. .. .. .. 62,000 Expenditure during 1350 (1931-32) .. .. .. .. 61,400 The programme of work for the year 1350 was limited owing to the uncertainty of collecting the revenue. At the end of the year a sum of Rs. 7,000 is still out standing being ow^ed to the Municipality on account of house and shop taxes. New Sea Road. —The largest new work done by the Municipality during the year was the construction of a new main road running from east to west between the Sea Road and what was originally the edge of the town before the ground in side the sea road was reclaimed. This road cuts through the property of a number of different people including Government land, Mespers frontage, and the Amara20 of Abdurreliman Zayani, and H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s property. In places where buildings were removed compensation was paM by the Municipality. Part of the road was across ground that had been previously reclaimed and part of it was across unfilled in spaces. Up to now about Rs. 9,000 has been spent on the work but there remains a considerable amount of filling in to be done. This new road will benefit the owners of long strips of property lying between the town and the sea road which are at present mostly inaccessible except by narrow lanes running from North to South. At the same time three of these lanes, which were unhealthy water channels and receptacles for rubbish, have been filled in. Bazaar widening. —Motor traffic is now possible through most of the main bazaar streets though six years ago it was only possible to drive a car through two of the bazaars. A house was purchased and demolished to widema road and a new house was built to compensate an owner whose property had previously been demolished fcr road widening. Sea Wall. —A wall three feet high almost 200 feet long was built on the shore at Houra in order to reclaim a large piece of ground, the property of the Municipality, which was previously covered by the sea at high tides. Lunatic Asylum. —The building was surrounded by a wall six feet high made of stone and mud. This institution is now used by Muharraq as well as Manamah and it has been found to be very useful and necessary. Pier. —A pier, built out into the sea, on the western sea road was made as a place for dumping stones, mud, juss, etc., in order to prevent persons from stacking such material on the road itself. A fee is being charged which will eventually defray the cost of the building. Cemetery walls. —The stone walls, with gates at intervals, surrounding the Shia and Sunni cemeteries on the south of the town have been completed and the ap pearance of that part of the town is greatly improved and the graveyards are now free of dogs which used formerly to inhabit them and dig up the graves. Weights and measures. —Tested weights and measures manufactured in England and stamped with the Municipal stamp and amount of weights in Arabic have been sold to the local shopkeepers, the old innacurate weights have been taken in. Has Rouman Road. —Four houses on the South of the Agency garden were purchased and demolished in order to start a road, which is a continuation of the road passing the Agency entrance from East to West and which will finally link up with the Manamah Maharaq sea-road. Fruit Market. —A new fruit market adjoining the fish market was built by the Municipality at Shaikh Hamad’s expense on his own property. The floor is made of cement wuth facilities for sluicing over and the roof and sides are of palm sticks with cement pillars. This is a very great improvement on the old fruit market w T hich was dirty and dark and which could not easily be cleaned. Manamah now owns good meat, fish and fruit markets which are cleaned daily and supervised by the Municipality. A pipe line laid into the meat market from a neighbouring well provides a supply of water for cleaning the floors and the tiled counters of the stalls. Public lighting. —46 new lights were installed in the streets and bazaars. Municipal garden .— The wall of the garden was repaired and cages were made to contain various wild animals, gazelles, jackals, a vulture and an oryx w T hich form the beginning of a zoological garden. Poor boxes. —Boxes were placed in the streets and bazaars and outside some of the mosques, for contributions to the poor. About Rs. 30 was collected in this v’ay in one month. General. —A pump was erected at the end of 1349 on the marsh ground at Kozabia which is used for removing the water into a drain which carries it to the sea. In addition to the above the usual town cleaning, repairs to drains, supervision of dram pipes and oiling of water surfaces as prevention of mosquitoes was carried out during the year. During Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa’s absence on the Haj Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa has acted as President of the Council21 Towards the middle of the year the Majlis made a ten per cent, reduction in the salaries of all persons employed by the Municipality. At the end of the year it was decided that the bazars should remain open until three o’clock Arabic to enable people to use their shops and offices if they wished to. Previously no persons were allowed to enter or to be in the bazaar after sunset. In spite of bad times some building is being done by private persons mostly on the western side of the town in the neighbourhood of the new Eastern Bank. This area is likely to develop as a commercial district while the eastern part of the sea seems likely to remain a residential quarter. Maharaq Municipality. Rs. Revenue during 1350 (1931-32) .. .. .. .. 37,122 Expenditure during 1350 (1931-32) .. .. .. .. 28,916 The most important work in Muharraq during the year has been the extension of the electric power to the town and the electrification of the town and bazaars, but this is reported on under “ Electric ”. Apart from the usual routine work of cleaning the town, repairing water channels from wells and supervising drain pipes, etc., very little new work was done. The Muharraq pier was enlarged and repaired and more of the creek at the side of the pier was reclaimed. A temporary hospital was opened for four months during the summer for treating foreign divers who come to Bahrain in great numbers and are frequently when ill deposited on the shore by their naukhudas with no money or means of supporting themselves. The roofs of the bazaars were repaired and raised in many places. During the month of Ramadan, as in Manamah, the Municipality made arrangements with the butchers for the sale of meat at a reduced cost. Muharraq Nurse. —In April 1930, on the advice of the Government, the Muhar raq Municipality appointed an Indian trained nurse and midwife to work in con junction with the doctor attending to women and children in Muharraq. Service of this kind was very badly needed both in Muharraq and Manamah as the staff of the American women’s hospitals is not sufficient to cope with the maternity work in Bahrain and owing to their religious work they are not admitted into many of the Arab and Bahrana houses. The Municipal nurse w 7 as viewed for some time with suspicion but by degrees the people of Muharraq have learnt to appreciate her as is shown by the following statistics. 1930, April — December. Successful maternity cases .. .. 35 Clinic petients .. .. .. 4,529 1931, January — December. Maternity cases .. .. .. 39 Clinic patients .. .. .. 6,647 1932, January — April. Maternity cases .. .. .. 7 Clinic patients .. .. .. 1,256 Total 2 years and four months .. 85 maternity cases, and 12,432 clinic patients. There is need for at least one other midwife of this type in Bahrain who can to some extent counteract the damage which is being done by the local midwives whose methods are in every way as bad, and in some respects worse, than those practised in India which were recently the subject of a book which caused universal comment. MC517FD P22 Agriculture. For financial reasons it has been impossible to start any new agricultural projects or even to sink an artesian well in order to make an experimental garden so the work of Mr. Said Abdul Noor has been extremely limited, owing to no fault cf his own, and he has had to devote his attention to the Palace and Municipal gardens and to Shaikh Hamad’s garden, Sanayan. It is very unfortunate that he has not been given more scope as from the work which he has done, it has been proved that a number of vegetables which have a market value, and various different trees and cotton, which is most important of all, can be successfully grown in Bahrain. There is no doubt if money was available for the original outlay that a large experimental garden growing fruit and vegetables and run on modern methods would in course of time become a paying proposition, but the expense of fencing, water j roduction, and preparing the ground make it impossible to start such a work at present. The Aali experiment .—An attempt was made in 1349 (1930-31) to start an experimental garden at Aali, on the site of the old landing ground. The water which was produced however was so strongly impregnated with sulphur as to be useless for irrigating cultivation and during the summer of 1350, the garden was abandoned and the fencing which had been put up was removed to Shaikh Hamad’s house at Sakhir. Possibilities at Zellag .—A large area of country along the coast in the neigh bourhood of Zellag was found to be very suitable for cultivation and it was sup posed that it was Government property. Owing to . the distance from Manamah it was not convenient as a site for an experimental garden but negotiations were entered into with Abdul Aziz Kozaibi &amp; Co., who wished to buy a large area of ground in order to grow corn, etc. The Government was prepared to sell 100 acres at Rs. 15 per acre with an option of a further 400 acres at Rs. 30 per acre and a further 500 acres at Rs. 35 per acre making 1,000 acres in all, subject to a stipulation that a proportion of each lot purchased should be put under cultivation within a clefinite time-limit. The Kozaibis would not agree to these terms and as Abdul Aziz Kozaibi left Bahrain before any arrangement was made the matter is still in abeyance. It was afterwards found that H. E. Shaikh Hamad claims the whole of this area as his private property in virtue of a “ Hiba ” gift document from Shaikh Isa. Palace Garden .—This garden has never been a success partly because there is more salt in the soil than in many other places and partly because there is, and al ways has been brackish water very close under the surface of the ground. For some time work has been done by a gang of prisoners who are raising the surface of the south end, which is the worst portion, by bringing in sand from outside the garden. Cotton was planted in this garden, but it grew very badly. It was rooted up and lucerne was planted instead. Two sowings of lucerne were a failure owing to strong shamal winds destroying the young plants. Lucerne is very susceptible to wind and needs a good shelter when young. After two failures a comparatively good crop was obtained in some parts of the garden. In November California barley was planted in the northern part of the garden and this produced a successful crop which is being kept for seed. This brand of barley seems to thrive well and is evidently suited to Bahrain. Various vegetable seeds were also sown in this garden with mixed results. Some of them partly succeeded, some failed to- germinate and others died after germination. The reasons for the failures are attributed to :— 1 . Excessive saltness of the soil.'' 2. High winds at time of germination. 3. Water by irrigation. The following vegetables have grown very successfully:—Beans, lettuce, cauliflowers, turnips, potatoes, beetroot, spinach, radish and a crop of linseed grew well in one part of the garden but failed completely in another part.23 The following trees, grown from seed, have been planted in the Palace garden,— scented acacia farnaciona and parkinsonia acculata. About 25 orange trees, from Basrah, were also planted, but they are not doing as well as in Sanayan. Municipal Garden .—Flower seeds were planted in October, in tubs but very few of them succeeded, those that grew best were stocks and wall-flowers. It has now been proved that seeds are more successful if sown in the ground, not in tubs or boxes. A number of tree seeds were sown but only acacia eucalyptus and parkinsonia germinated. These have now been transplanted and are growing well. The water supply is at present inadequate for irrigating the whole garden and the drain which carries water from an adjacent mosque through the garden to the main sewer has caused much trouble by constantly becoming blocked. Sanayan garden. —Sanayan, which is H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s own property, was previously leased to some local Bahama who were ejected because they failed to pay their rent. It was in bad condition, the irrigation channels were choked by rubbish and leaves and hundreds of loz trees, which yielded an almost worthless harvest, had been allowed to grow up among the date trees killing many of the young palms and keeping the sun off others although it is well known that date trees do not thrive without sun. During the previous year a number of the date trees were manured, as is done in Iraq, but this year for economical reasons no more manuring has been done. Almost all the loz trees have been cut down and have been sawn up to a saleable size, which is slow and expensive work as only small handsaws are used. The wood is now being sold, by degrees, to the public and also to the Police force who are purchasing from Sanayan instead of from the rations contractor. This wood should in time produce three or four thousand rupees as it includes quantities of pieces which are used for boat building and which fetch a good price when required. During 1349 the garden produced about 60 gillas of dates, during 1350 it pro duced 105 gillas. It must be admitted that the 1349 season was a very bad one, owing to locusts and disease. \ ery few of the dates were sold, almost all of them being consumed by H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s household, a fact which he rarely ap pears to appreciate. In addition to the dates, households of H. E. Shaikh Hamad were provided with local vegetables, vegetable marrows, tomatoes, ladies fingers, egg plants, etc. ? during most of the year. The following trees and cuttings were planted in Sanayan during the year:— 175 orange trees from Basrah ; 90 peaches from Hassa ; 8 citrons from Hassa ; 7 lemons from Hassa ; 879 date trees, some from Sanayan and some from Hassa. The orange trees are growing extremely well; with the exception of four they are all strong and healthy, and, though it is unusual, about a dozen trees produced blossom and would actually bear fruit if they were allowed to. A few apple cuttings from Hassa are growing well, also grapes, pomegranates and apricots. Cotton growing .—The cultivation of cotton in Bahrain is probably not a new thing. There is mention of cotton being sent from Bahrain to the Caliphs in Baghdad in historical times, but as the term ‘ Bahrain ’ in those days included both the islands and the mainland it is not possible to assert that it was grown in what is now known as Bahrain. In most of the gardens there are a few bushes of cotton but it has not been cultivated in recent times. The first sowing of cotton was made at Aali, where Rustom 68 was sown, and 95% of the seeds germinated within fifteen days. Unfortunately this progress was not maintained; the young plants died and after two months only a negligible number of plants remained alive. The reason for this failure was probably the sulphur in the water which gradually saturated the soil and killed the plants. •&lt;&lt; 2A After this experiment Abdul Aziz Kozaibi, who has always taken a great in terest in agriculture offered to plant cotton in a piece of ground on the outskirts of Manamah and this planting was on the whole a very successful undertaking. The area planted was about three acres of new ground. On 15th April work was begun on preparing the ground, digging it over and manuring it; ridges were made and it was irrigated prior to sowing wdiich began on 1 st May. The ground was divided as follows :— lbs. 1 | acres—Bustom 82 1 acre—Rustom 90 fth acre—Rustom 68 371 30 22J Rustoms 82 and 90 were sown on ridges and 68 on plain plots. The seed germi nated very well, within about 15 days. The recent manuring had a bad effect on the plants after germination, tut this was counteracted by more frequent irrigation. About 90% of the germinated plants succeeded and it is thought that 95 % of the seeds had germinated. Unfortunately owing to the sowing being unusually late only one flush was obtained and this resulted in the following amount:— Rustom 82 Rustom 90 Rustom 68 lbs. 940 700 600 The results of this experiment were reported minutely to Mr. Eastwood of the British Cotton Growing Association, Baghdad, who has reported on it and the samples which were sent, very favourably; but unfortunately owing to the state of the cotton market even if a far greater amount had been grown its export from Bahrain would not, at present, be a financial proposition, but it is a matter of con siderable importance to know now that the soil water and climate of Bahrain is suitable for the growing of cotton. Import of trees, etc .—All trees and plants imported into Bahrain were inspected by Mr. Said Abdul Noor before being removed from the Customs and a small pro portion were condemned as suffering from disease, dust disease, scales, gamosis, etc., which affect citrus trees especially. During year 1349 between ten and fifteen thousand young date trees were imported from Hassa and Katif but during 1350 only about 1500 were imported owing to the prohibitive export tax which has recently been imposed on date trees by the Government of H. M. King Ibn Saud. In spite of the limitations set on Mr. Said Abdul Noor’s work owing to lack of funds I consider that what he has achieved is of considerable value and has proved that there are agricultural potentialities in Bahrain which are well worth developing if money was available. The Bahrain Electric Supply. The Bahrain Electric Supply has been seriously affected by the acute economic depression in Bahrain which has deterred many people from the initial outlay of installing electric light in their houses and shops. This has been particularly apparent in Muharraq where the capital expended on the extension has produced less revenue than might reasonably have been‘expected because so few of the leading merchants have taken it up. Muharraq extension. —The decision to extend the electric power to Muharraq was made at the beginning of 1350. The work was carried out by Messrs. Cal lenders Cable and Construction Co., whose tender was accepted by the Bahrain Government. The amount of the tender was Rs. 52,144. The work was completed on 1 st Jamadi al Awal 1350 (13th September 1931) and by the end of the year, 24 consumers had been connected. The extension is connected to Manama by approximately 1 | miles of 3300 volt overhead trans mission line which is carried across the shallow sea on poles built into islands along the site of the Manamah-Muharraq road. A submarine cable approxi mately 700 yards long, lying on the bed of the sea, conveys the current across25 the deep channel which runs between the two islands, and is used as a passage by boats travelling North and South. To prevent boats crossing underneath the line in the Muharraq harbour, a wooden boom has been placed between the islands on which the poles are built. The high tension line terminates at Muhar raq in a step-down 3300/440 volt sub-station, from which the town distribution is taken. Distribution in the town of Muharraq is by low tension over head lines, where suitable, and by under-ground cables in some parts of the bazaars. Lines have been run along the principal thoroughfares and districts of potential consumers,, certain roads and bazaars being lighted by the Municipality. From the connecting date until the end of 1350, 24 consumers have been connected or approximately 280 points. A Municipal wiring scheme was arranged by the Municipal Council by which persons wiring their houses should pay for the wiring over a period of two years. The Municipality allocated Rs. 4,000 for this purpose but in spite of this there has been small result owing to shortness of money. The public as a whole appreciate and like the electric light and are only deteired from installing it for financial reasons. They find that it is more economical and very much more satisfactory than oil lamps w’hich were previously used. Manama.. —In Manama 52. additional consumers have been connected dur ing the year bringing the total number of consumers in Manama up to 274 altogether. An innovation in Manama, and also in Muharraq is the permission to keep the bazaars open until four hours after sunset instead of being closed to the public at sunset,, by order of the Government. This restriction was very necessary when there were no lights in the bazaars and when public security was not what it is now. Owing to the new arrangement about 20 shops have been wired and some which were already wired now use lights after dark. This new concession will be of most benefit in the winter because in the summer it is the custom of the people to walk outside the town in the evenings and enjoy the air and most of the bazaar coffee shops move out of the bazaar to positions on the edge of the town.. Ice machine ^—During 1350 one of the two ice plants bought by the Munici pality from H. E. Shaikh Hamad was dismantled and re-erected in the Power House where it is. now driven by a 15 H. P. electric motor instead of an oil engine. Power is supplied to the Municipality at the special rate of one anna per unit.. It was run very successfully during the summer of 1350, vide Municipal report. The original rate charged remains at 8 annas per unit for light and 4 annas per unit for power. Wiring .—Until 28th October all wiring was done by Messrs. Callenders Cable and Construction Co., but on completion of the Muharraq scheme, 'when the company handed over, the Government of Bahrain took up the wiring work. After very lengthy negotiations wliich finally resulted in a considerable reduction in the prices the Government purchased from Messrs. Callenders a supply of wiring material for Rs. 8,000 which it was calculated would last for about six months. Over 2/3rds of this material has already been used. When Messrs. Callenders completed their work they had a large stock of surplus material which they wished the Bahrain Government to buy from them. The price amounted to about Rs. 19,000, after lengthy correspondence which resulted in numerous reductions in the price of various items. The Government decided not to pur chase this stock, owing to uncertainty in prices and unwillingness to incur additional responsibility; as it was inconvenient and expensive for Messrs. Callenders to remove the material or to store it, an arrangement was eventually made by which the Government took it over as consignment stock but accepting no responsibility for it. It was insured by Messrs. Callenders. The Government has already drawn on this stock to over Rs. 1 , 000 . Since taking over the wiring w T ork the Government has wired 76 houses, in about six months and the wiring personnel has been continuously employed. The nett profit after paying wages, material, etc., etc., is ^s. 1,282. The profit MC517FDlias been kept very low in order to encourage people to instal electricity which will eventually increase revenue. Messrs. Callenders’ standard price for wiring was Rs. 22 - 8-0 per point. The average price charged by the Government is Rs. 18 but the charge varies accord ing to the amount of material used. At present the department has orders in hand sufficient to employ the wiring staff for the next two months. The wiring which has been done includes offices, houses, shops, mosques and matems. The Kaleeco system is used for wiring; it is lead covered, safe and durable, and the cheaper V. i. r, cleat wiring is also available, but although there is a big difference in the price, the public unanimously insist on the Raleeco method. The department also sells domestic appliances, such as refrigerators, heaters, kettles, etc., and for these there is a slow but steady market. With the exception of the refrigerators all the material used now is English. The fans which were originally installed were Italian, but a make of English fans is now being used, State Engineer ,—On the termination of Messrs. Callenders’ work in Bahrain the Government appointed Mr. W. B. Steele as State Engineer, on a four years agreement. He had previously belonged to Messrs. Callenders and had acted as their Executive Engineer in Bahrain for some months during their work on the Bahrain contract. Profit and Loss .—The figures in the statements which accompany this report show particulars of revenue and capital and recurrent expenditure from which the financial position of the undertaking can be ascertained. The loss during the whole year includes depreciation on all plant and machinery (generation and distribution) which is a very heavy item, and which hgs been assessed at rates varying from 4 to 15 per cent., and amounts to Rs. 32,000, which is Rs.. 5,000 more than 1340. But out of this amount Rs. 22,400 is depreciation only and it has increased considerably during 1350 owing to the additional depreciation on the Muharraq extension material which has been cab culated for the ^vhole year. The balance of the loss, about Rs. 9,600, includes certain items which are non-recurrent such as passages to State Engineer on first appointment, furniture, rent of a house for Power House staff leased for four years and a bill from Messrs. Callenders for running expenses for the last month of 1349. Deducting these extraordinary amounts it is found that the cash loss on the running during 1350, was about Rs. 400 per month ; if the Muharraq scheme had not been entered the loss would be about Rs. 630 per month apart from depreciation. Consumption .—It will be noticed that the unit consumption in the case of public lighting is much less than during 1349. This is accounted for by the fact that the Municipalities reduced the wattage of their street lighting to 25 per lamp instead of an average of 60, for, from their point of view, economical reasons. The units lost on transmission amount to Rs. 23 per cent. This is a higher percentage than usual and is due to the five sub-stations being lightly loaded as will be seen by the number of units generated during the year, with conse quent high transformer losses. This loss will decrease as the load increases. Fuel oil .—Fuel oil cost per unit averages *33 annas per unit generated and lubricating oil -09 annas. The first figure compares very favourably with other diesel stations in India which have a 60 per cent, or 70 per cent, load factor whereas Bahrain at present is in the neighbourhood of 26 per cent, only allowing for the station being closed between November and April from 9-30 a. m. till 3-30 p. m. Prospects for 1351.—II wiring continues at the present rate it is hoped that enough load will be obtained during the summer of 1351 to enable the plant to run 24 hours during the whole year. Assuming that the wiring of houses proceeds at the present rate (approxi mately 50 points per month or, say, 600 in a year) a further connected lighting load of approximately 24 kilo watts would be obtained, but if there was a revival in trade generally the points connected should easily be doubled. A connected load of 24 k. w. would produce an additional Rs. 10,000 per annum revenue.28 Balance Sheet—Bahrain Electric Supply. (As on 1 st Muharram 1351.) [(7th May 1932).] Liabilities. Assets.

Receipts during 1350 [(1931-32)] 15,712 Expenditure .. .. .. •• •• 14,340 The condition of this Department continues to be unsatisfactory and it will remain so as long as it is run privately by the three Sunni Kadis. There is a strong feeling among the general public and also the lesser mullahs that they and the public should have some voice in the administration of the Sunni Wakfs, but unless H. E. Shaikh Hamad takes up the matter nothing can be done. On various occasions complaints have been made to the Government that Wakf property is not being properly administered, these complaints are referred to the department concerned. % Shia WaJcf Department.

It has been affected like all other departments by the prevailing financial depression, particularly because its revenue is derived entirely from rents of date gardens and a few fish traps which are leased by the country Bahama who are by far the poorest community in Bahrain. The large balance of Rs. 10,315 owing to the department does not include the amounts which were remitted from the rents in cases where the Majlis was satis fied that the debtors were genuinely unable to pay. Some good work has been carried out during the year in improving gardens, planting young date trees and preparing ground which has fallen into disuse. In Sitra and Jezirah especially the Wakf property has greatly improved and several hundred young trees have been planted. Unfortunately in some cases the villagers do not appreciate this work and would prefer derelict mosques to be rebuilt instead of the wakf property being improved, although in most villages the number of mosques far exceeds the requirements of the population. Until the Wakf department was started no money was ever spent on the gardens so their rental value gradually diminished. During the year several pieces of ground adjacent to wakf gardens have been bought in order to consolidate the property. The department has suffered somewhat through the incessant intrigues and quarrels of the various religious leaders among the Shias ; although individually they are all opposed to each other they all resent the existence of a department which prevents the wakf funds being maladministrated and in many cases misappropriated by themselves. The two Shia Kadis, who are Government officials, are the only ones who do not endeavour to injure the organization. The ecc-Kadi Shaikh Khalaf is notoriously mischievous in this respect and uses his great influence in persuading his followers to agitate for the wakfs to be given back into his hands. Fortunately the members of the Majlis are men of some standing and until now they have been able to counteract his opposition. At the end of the year elections took place for a new majlis but owing to Muharram the elections will not be completed until during the first month of the new year. The elections were held at the chief village of every district wher$ about half a dozen representatives were summoned from each village in the neigh bourhood. The voting was by ballot, each person writing on a slip of paper the name of the man he wished to elect, the individual obtaining most votes was appointed as a member of the mejlis. Although this was an entirely novel pro cedure among the Bahama they took to it with excessive keenness. In some places the old member was re-elected and in other places a new representative was appointed. The previous members were chosen by the Government, as at that time the mejlis was a new institution and it was politic that they should be appointed, not elected. The members of the mejlis were chosen as being the leading men of the district and acquainted with date cultivation. One of their duties is to assist in collecting the rents from the wakf tenants and also to supervise the gardens and to report when repairs and work are necessary to the mosques or to the property itself. The department has now begun to register its property in the Land Depart ment, obtaining Government title deeds for the wakf gardens, but it will be some years before they are all registered as there are many thousands of separate “• pieces ” sometimes consisting of two or three date trees in the middle of a gard( n. The department has been involved in a considerable amount of litigation with various landowners, usually members of the Ruling Family who claim wakf property as being part of their own gardens. It is a regrettable fact that when these eases are referred to the Sunni Shera court, for decisions, they are not dealt with impartially. The members of the Ruling family and the Sunni Kadis, are inclined to resent the existence of the department, the Khalifah dislike it because they are afraid that it will claim ownership to wakf property which has at previous times been illegally confiscated by them, and the Kadis resent it because they are afraid that public opinion will force upon them a similar department which would mean that they would no longer have entirely unrestrained control over Wakf revenue. One of the advantages of registration of wakf property will be that MC517FD30 once the title deeds are issued there will be an end to the incessant litigation be tween land owners and wakf department. Trade and Customs. In comparison with the Budget estimates the collections were— Budget head. Estimated collection. Actual. Gain. Loss. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs.

When, in Dhul Haj 1349, the rate of Khanchia upon bag cargo was increased to three annas per bag of three Bahrain maunds, it was estimated that such increase would result in one lakh of collection. The practice developed of transhipping bag cargo at sea thus evading these charges ; and in view of the situation it was decided to refund to the re-exporter the difference between the pre-existing rate and the new rate. This has been carried into effect wdth the result that the net result is a gain to the State of Rs. 57,944 instead of the estimated lakh. At the moment it is doubtful whether the political arrangement was intended to include oversides delivery of cargo within the Port Limits, and a legal decision | on that point is being sought. If the view is taken that any craft may avail itself i of the amenities of the port without paying any dues at all, then such oversides I deliveries will occur to a greater extent that at present, and the result will be the loss to Bahrain of its two per cent, re-export duty, and also the concurrent Import i Yard charges. ' It will be noticed that the collections from pearling licenses exceed the estimation by Rs. 16,650. This result is not due to under-estimation ; but it will be remem bered that the collections for the year 1349 A. H. were less than the estimate by Rs. 13,968. This was because many licenses were renewed later than was expected, and owing to the movement of the Muhammadan calendar, the actual receipts fell into the year under report instead of 1349. The receipts from craft registrations show a slight gain over the estimate ; but this does not so much imply that more craft are registered than formerly, only that a number of registered owners delayed their renewals, and consequently had to pay ten rupees instead of two rupees for each renewal.The Tobacco tax shows a rather unexpected gain due to the increasing quantity of this import. This commodity could, I think, well bear a heavier rate of tax. I give here a comparison of the actual receipts for the two years 1349 and 1350, from Customs and Import yard only. 1349 1350 [(1930-31)]. [(1931-32) Rs. Rs.

It will be remembered that just over a year ago certain adjustments in the conditions of R. E. Cargo were made, which, it was hoped, would give greater elasticity in the trade with the mainland. The increase in the receipts suggest that this may be the case. In general the resons for the decrease in Customs receipts are substantially the same as for last year, although the quantity of sugar has increased, and, notably, cotton piece-goods. Here, one notes with regret, India and England have been practically driven out of the local market by cheaper inferior and showier Japanese goods, especially in the re-export to the mainland ports. The following comparison illustrates the major imports. 1349 [(1930-31)]. 1350 [1931-32)]. Commodity. Quantity. Average value. Quantity. Average value. Rs. Rs.

Iraq registrations Arabian Persian Indian African 168 craft. 142 „ 59 „ 58 „ 21 00 These craft use the port, partly for import into Bahrain, partly for re-export of cargo, and to a considerable extent for direct transhipment of cargo at sea, within the port limits. This w^as notably the case of the 96 Kuwait craft, which in general take cargoes from Iraq to Karachi, and return with a manifest for Kuwait; but visit Bahrain en route mainly for this direct transhipment of rice. Their rates of freight are said to be considerably lower than the B. I. S. N'. Companies rates, and, although they do not ply during the monsoon season, yet their activity is encouraged by local Nejdy traders, and this traffic is hkely to be a competing factor with the B. I. S. N. Co. In the year 1349, 501,805 packages of cargo were brought here by 96 steamers. In the year 1350, 475,544 packages were brought here by 97 steamers.

There are vacancies for one clerk and one apprentice. The hand worked crane upon the Customs pier has not been used so much as was expected; but its usefulness has been well proven when it is applied to the removal of heavy packages of machinery, motor cars, etc. An arrangement has been made for the adjustment with the landing Company of certain items of their Landing charges, which will make the rates levied upon the relative commodities more equable to the importers. The usefulness of the Customs Light at Manamah, erected last year, has thoroughly justified its existence, which is acknowledged by many navigators using the port. In continuance of this purpose, the small oil-lights upon the Muharraq Customs Flagstaff have been replaced by a 100 watt electric light which is visible well beyond the outer buoy and adds to the efficiency of the Port. This lighting service is given free of charge. The port is served by a weekly mail service up and down, by the B. I. S. N. Company’s steamers ; and in addition is regularly visited by vessels of the Strick- Ellerman Line, the Hansa Line, both with cargo direct from Europe, and the British Tanker Company, Limited with oil supphes from Abadan. It is also note worthy to observe that the port has been visited three times by vessels of Nor- weigian nationality under charter by the National Steamship Company an Indian organisation, which has run these ships in competition with the B. I. S. N. Com pany’s service, It is quite likely that such visits will be repeated, as occasion offers.33 Local Crafts .—There are registered in Bahrain at present 1308 craft, including 67 motor launches ; also, 33 craft including one motor-launch were sold to other Persian Gulf ports. The use of motor dhows for Tawwasha work at the pearl banks is now a regular practice, and there are two such craft regularly plying between this port and Kuwait with cargo and passengers. Other motor craft, as occasion offers, proceed to and from Dubai and sundry Persian Ports. Of the above 1,308 craft, 481 are registered for pearling; but of this number it is unfortunate to report that 248 have this year been declared for ‘ Khammos ’ diving, this being due to the prevailing lack of ready money. I think it well to draw attention again to the practice of transhipment of cargo at sea, within the Port limits, from one craft to another. The total value of such transhipments during the past year was Rs. 8,10,327 on which duty at 5% would bave been Rs. 40,516 or at 2 % I^s. 16,206. It is gratifying to note that, as regards the quantity of cargo passing through this port, Bahrain is maintaining its position as the leading port in the Persian Gulf. General. Gold Sales. —The high price paid for golden coins and gold ornaments induced numbers of people in Bahrain to realise their gold ornaments and also stores of English sovereigns which many people had kept buried. A large quantity of gold ornaments were also imported into Bahrain from the mainland and towards the end of the year there w'as a very brisk trade in gold ornaments which were shipped dow r n to India. Bahrain Petroleum Company.—The company started actual digging opera tions in September 1931, and by the end of the year the well on which they are working had reached a depth of about 1,800 feet. Shortly before the end of the year a certain amount of oil was found but it was discovered that this was of no real value as the gas was insufficient to bring it up to the surface. The company are now drilling deeper. Manufacture of tiles. —Khalil Kanoo and a Syrian relation of one of the Edu cation staff entered into partnership to manufacture coloured tiles. The workmen were Syrians from Beyrout. About 70,000 tiles were manufactured but owing to the tightness of money only a very small percentage were sold. The partnership dissolved and the two parties are competing against each other in selling tiles which has resulted their being sold at a very low price. The Eastern Bank. —Since the Eastern Bank came to Bahrain some ten years ago it has occupied a house rented from Abdul Aziz Kozibi &amp; Co. During 1350 [(1931-32)] the Bank purchased a site, in the sea, adjacent to the Western Sea Road. This site was previously owned by Mohamed Sharif the bankrupt Persian merchant and was sold as part of his assets. The ground has been reclaimed and a very handsome new bank has been built which is to be completed early in 1351. The Contractors are the same firm who built the Port Trust building and the Eastern Bank in Basrah. The building of the new bank has encouraged several local persons to build shops on the opposite side of the Sea Road which strengthens the tendency for the bazaar to expand towards the north west of the town. The Pilgrimage. —An exceptionally small number of people from Bahrain attended the 1350 pilgrimage but they included Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa and two sons of H. E. Shaikh Hamad, Shaikhs Mubarak and Abdulla who travelled to Jeddah by sea and returned across Arabia to Bahrain by the land route. Naval Survey. —H. M. S. “ Ormonde ”, R. N. Survey boat, spent over two months in Bahrain doing a survey of the harbour and surroundings. She sailed shortly before the end of the year. Very small interest was taken in the matter by the local population. Shaikh Khalaf. —At the end of 1349, Shaikh Khalaf A1 Asfur the ez-Shia Kadi of Bahrain, who had retired to Iraq, was inadvertently issued with a permit by the Iraq authorities and allowed to return to Bahrain. Having arrived he was given permission to remain for three months in order to settle his affairs in Bahrain, on condition that he remained in Manama. During the Summer of 1350 this order was unofficially cancelled, Shaikh Khalaf was allowed to visit any place in Bahraini r\ * 34 and all question of Ms returning to Iraq was dropped. Shaikh Khalaf had been twice dismissed from his position of Kadi owing to his nefarious practices, during the time of Shaikh Isa, and he left Bahrain the last time in order to avoid further criminal proceedings. He has always had a great deal of influence among the Bahama in certain districts and since his return from Iraq his authority seems to have increased. His prestige is far greater among the Bahama than that of either of the authorised Kadis and he uses his influence to undermine their authority and also to damage the Shia Wakf Department. Although he is an old man he is extremely active and he travels round the Bahama villages preaching in the mosques on Friday and usurping the privileges of the official Kadis who naturally resent and fear his presence in Bahrain. Dawasirs and mainland Arabs .—There is no sign of the Dawasir returning to Bahrain and at present this event is most unlikely as the chief men of the tribe are heavily in debt to various Bahrain merhants and if they brought their boats and divers back to Bahrain they would almost certainly be forced to hand them over to the Bahrain merchants in settlement of their diving claims. There have been no further developments with regard to the Qatar Arabs who proposed migrating to Bahrain and very little had been heard of the Shia Bahama resident on the Persian coast who came to Bahrain in large numbers to obtain nationality documents during the previous year. A certain number of Shias from Katif, of Bahrain stock, have come to Bahrain but the local Government does not allow able-bodied men to leave that country. Distinguished visitors. — The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Bahrain several times during the year and on 4th January 1931 he attended a Durbar which was held at the Palace by H. E. Shaikh Hamad on the occasion of the presentation of the Kaiser-i-Hind medal to Dr. R. D. Holmes. In December H. M. S. “ Emerald ” visited Bahrain and remained for several days and the usual official visits were exchanged. On the last day of her stay a most tragic accident occurred ; the ship’s aeroplane while giving a display to a number of local Arabs, including boys from the Government schools, crashed in the sea and the pilot Lieutenant Heinemann, was killed. He was buried in the Christian cemetery in Bharain on the following day. Sir Philip Sassoon, Under Secretary of State for Air, and the British Minister in I Persia paid short unofficial visits to Bahrain. Shaikh Ahmad bin Jabir, the Ruler of Kuwait paid three visits to Bahrain’ on the last occasion he accompanied the Political Resident and attended the Durbar. Innumerable other Arab chiefs, mostly from Oman, came to Bahrain during the year including the following ; Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim, Ruler of Qatar, Shaikhs Said and Juma, sons of Maktoom of Dubai. Prince Ahmed, grandson of the late Sultan Abdul Aziz of Turkey, accompanied by Jamaal Pasha, who was at one time a well-known Turkish General and took part in the Senussi campaign in 1915, were also entertained by H. E. Shaikh Hamad while making a tour of the Persian Gulf. M517FD—20—20-9-32—GIPSFILE COPY HJR/MJ 4 I) F, 0 Y p H F H 0 F I!, rom {COPIFS CT tiCU LATBli) .

Further reports received from the Government of India indicate that the temporary increase of Customs duties mentioned m my tele^am of the 5th April. Circular R No.51 has not proved sufficient to alleviate the financial situation in Bahrein which remains acute. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf after iiul examination of possible alternatives has urged that the situation can only be satisfactorily dealt with if the limitation imposed by Article IV of the 1861 Convention is temporarily withdrawn. The Government of India endorse this recommendation as a purely temporary measure subject to the safeguards (i) that the goods of all British subjects shall be subject to no other or higher duties than those imposed on other goods of the same kind (ii) that the Political Resident shall be given four months notice of any increase in the duties above the rates at present permitted in order that, he may have the opportunity of making any observations that he may consider desirable. No formal modification of the Convention is contemplatedo //e are advised that the gravity of the situation in Bahrein renders early action imperative, and we propose therefore unless His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions have any observation to oi.er to improve the Government of India by telegraph in ter, days time that we concur in the Political Resident's reconmendation subject to the safe^ards set out above.Minute Paper political Department, Please see previous submission on P.Z.3819/32 on the subject of the grant of tariff autonomy to Bahrein. The proposals made in that paper were discussed at an interdepartmental meeting at the Foreign Office on 26th august. A note of the j discussion is flagged H. In the light of that | discussion the Government of India were consulted in the Secretary of State's telegram No.2304 of 6th . September on P.Z.5279/32, the proposals made in which were accepted in their reply of 14th September, on P.Z.5586/32. Briefly the position is that as the i result of interdepartmental discussion and the views | of the Government of India, it is now proposed that I the tariff autonomy to be granted to the Sheikh should be temporary instead of permanent, and secondly, that the Dominions should be given an ! opportunity of expressing their views before any communication is made to the Sheikh. A draft letter to the Sbeikh (for signature by the Political Resident) has been prepared and agreed by the interested Departments. I submit that 1 may now be authorised to send it demi-officially to Mr. Dixon of the Dominions Office for the necessary action with the Dominions. 2. It will be seen that the draft is entirely ! Impersonal, the object of this being to avoid requests by interested Dominions that a separate note or the like should be put in In respect of them. Itis much to he hoped, however, that the Sheikh of * Bahrein will not (like the sheikh of ^atar in a recent instance) take exception to a letter which does not mention H.M.G. The risk is, however, one which will have to he faced* A second point is that raised in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office letter of,26th September, on P.Z.5853/32, viz. the Foreign Office suggestion that a proviso should he added to the draft to the effect that our temporary withdrawal of the limitations on the Sheikh*s tariff autonomy should he terminated on four months' notice. For the reasons stated in the Foreign Office letter I thought that we had better leave this alone ana they have not pressed the point* It will, however, he put on record by their letter, copies of which have gone to India and Bushire. 3.

Will you now be so kind as to approach the Dominions by telegram, as agreed at the interdepartmental meeting on 26th August.

We consider, however, that there would be considerable advantage in inserting a pj-ovieo that, before a change is made in tariffs, Political Resident should be informed and given an opportunity of making any observations ne may consider desirable. This procecure would serve as notice g-o His Majesty’s Government and the Government of. India of intended changes, and a definite period of notice might well be prescribed.

W. 1. 26th September, 1932 (E 4750/V82/91) Dear Laithwaite With reference to our conversation on the 21st September and to your letter of the 17th September to me, I write to let you know that we have only two suggestions to make on your draft letter to the Sheikh of Bahrein, embodying our temporary withdrawal of the limitation imposed by Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 upon his right to impose customs duties on the joods of British subjects. We suggest that the word 'other' should be inserted before the phrase 'goods of the same kind' at 'the end of the first sentence of paragraph 3 of the draft. \ Secondly, we suggest that the last sentence of the draft should be omitted. Our view is that we are notifying the Sheikh of a voluntary concession which we have decided to make. We are not concluding a j.G. Laithwaite, Esq.. COPY SENT BY AIR MAILa new treaty arrangement with him and it is not for him to 'bargain about it. It may be well to put on record that we originally made a further suggestion, namely that a phrase should be added at the end of the penultimate sentence of your draft to the effect that our temporary withdrawal of the limitation may be terminated upon foui* months* notice. This proposal we have agreed to drop in deference to your view that it would make an unfortunate impression on the Sheikh, as appearing to suggest that we had in mind an early termination of the withdrawal of the limitation, and that there was no danger in the case of a principality so much under our influence as Bahrein that, in the absence of such a provision, difficulties might arise if and when we wished to exercise our right to determine the arrangement embodied in the note. In sending instructions to the Political Resident, you will no doubt make it clear that the Sheikh must reply acknowledging - and presumably expressing gratitude for — the concession embodied in the Resident’s letter.

Before dealing with the Bahrein question to discuss which the meeting had primarily been called, MR* RTMDKL referred to the somewhat parallel case of Muscat in which it was proposed that the British and French Governments should agree to a temporary modification of their treaties which would enable the Buitan to 1 increase customs duties in Muscat. Ke pointed out that the Muscat case was a simpler one than that of Bahrein, since it turned on the national status of shipping, whereas the Bahrein proposals/proposals affected the rights of British subjects froa parts of the Empire, f The Ind J Office had prepared and sent to the Forei,jx Office, Board of Trade and Dominions Office in their letter No. P.Z.4971/52 of the 24 th August, draft notes to the Bui tan of Muscat which would be addressed to His Highness on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and of the French Government. The terns of these draft notes were generally acceptable. The Foreign Office would, however like to suggest two small modifications - i*e. the omission of the final paragraph In both draft notes; and the substitution, for the words M to inform your Highness on ^cur behalf** in paragraph 2, sentence 2, of the French note. of the words 'to address to Your Highness on , ’’their behalf a communication on the subject 'similar to that which has this day been M addressed to you on behalf of His Majesty’s 'Government in the United Kingdom. I am \*therefore to inform Your Highness on behalf *of the Government of the French Republic....'Mr* Rendel explained the reasons which had led the Foreign Office to suggest these amendments* MR* LAITHWAITE intimated that these modi fications would be acceptable to the India Office, and they were agreed to by the meeting. MR, DlX&amp;f pointed out that the only v -TVdvJ - Dominions interested In the Muscat Treaty were 0 nada and the Irish Free State* since Australia * i On ^6* S oa*&gt;a. /S erv* 8«d Bou^hr Africa had already iienadnced the ffrtl ’tyfi cax^va ^U&lt;» ^ ^ ' Treat^and the other Dominions had newer been CK ttt* - parM-em to it, f He therefore suggested that notes similar to that addressed to the Sultan on behalf of His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom should, if Canada and the Irish Free State agreed, be addressed to His Highness on behalf of these two Dominions. A discussion then followed regarding the question whether, if either Canada or the Irish Free State refused to agree to action being taken on their behalf or sent no reply at all, paragraph 3(a) of the draft British note and paragraph 2(a) of the French note could be modified/ — — — — —« ——— ! — — — ■ * — ■ i ~ — ■ —modified to meet the situation which would he created hjr the fact that Canada and the Irish continue to pay the present low duty* It was suggested by the Dominions Office representa tives and generally agreed that in paragraph 3(a) f line 8 f of the draft British note, the word ,, other tt ('ships of all other nation8’ , ) might be replaced by the word 'foreign”. It was found, however, that no corresponding modification could be made in the case of the French Government's note without considerable difficulty and the suggestion for modifying the British note was accordingly dropped* Conclusion; It was agreed that the Dominions Office should take immediate stej to try to secure the consent of the Governs of Canada and the Irish Free State in the proposed note to the Bultan of Muscat, and that, pending the receipt of the replies of these Governments, no further action should tfajJx Free State would be able to claim that goods Canadian or Free Sdatermliipe shouldtoe taken in the direction of obtaining the French GtoYemmtnt ’ s concurrence in the draft note which it is proposed to send to the Sultan on their toehalf.Mr* Rendcl read to the meeting the firet sentence of Article 4 of the Bahrein Treaty of 1861, which was in the following terms: M British subjects of every denomination, it is understood, may reside in, and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrein, their goods being subject only to an ad valorem duty of five per cent, in cash or in kind'. The Government of India had approved the proposal of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that Bahrein should be granted tariff autonomy and the Board of Trade had suggested that this might be effected by the substitution for the words 'to an ad valorem 'duty of five per cent in cash or in kind' in the sentence of Article 4 quoted above, of the words 'to no other or higher duties than those 'Imposed upon any other goods of the same kind'. ! This provision of the Treaty was, Mr. Rendel pointed out, of a somewhat peculiar kind, as it dealt with the goods of British subjects and | not with British goods according to their origin. Another/Another peculiar feature of the 1 861 Treaty was that f having “been 'approved hy the Viceroy' it had then 'been 'ratified hy the Government 'of Bombay'• MR. BKN33BL stated that the modification of Article 4 of the 1861 Treaty hy means of a protocol had originally Been contemplated, hut further consideration had sho¥?n that there were too many difficulties in the way of such procedure, and the Foreign Office now proposed that the modif3c ation should he effected by means of an exchange of notes. While the wording suggested hy the Board of Trade appeared to he generally acceptable, he con sidered that it would he essential to obtain the consent of the Dominions before the proposed derogation from the Treaty could be made since it appeared to be a case of the definite abandonment of a right at present enjoyed by all British subjects from all parts of the Commonwealth. KR. DIXCE considered that two questions arose/■H 347 aroee ae regards the Dominiones (a) the manner in -which they should he approached, and (b) the form in which their consent should be made known to the Sheikh. As regards (a), Mr. Dixon proposed that, on this occasion, the Dominions Office should proceed on lines similar to those which they took In April 1932 when the Dominions Governments were informed that His Majesty’s Government proposed Id agree to a temporary increase in Bahrein customs rates and that they would do so unless the Dominions formulated objections before a certain date. MR. FITZMAURICE considered that the procedure followed in April might be open to criticism and quoted the resolution of the last Imperial Conference providing that i 'When His Majesty in negotiating a treaty or other international agreement acts in respect of one of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations only, he cannot and will not purport to bind, or to affect detrimentally the rights of his subjects belonging to another part of the Commonwealth ; unless the Government of suoh part have expressly consented thereto by the issue of full powers to that effect on their behalf either to the plenipotentiary of the negotia- ting/il ting Government or to a separate plenipotentiary of their own'* M^LAITHIAITE pointed out that the India Office would have serious ohjeetion to the Dominions heing 'brought too prominently into this question of Bahrein* The Bheikh probably was not aware that he was in relation with the Dominions Governments and the effect on a ruler of a small State in the Persian Gulf of a series of communications being made on behalf of various Dominions Governments might be most unfortunate* He was therefore all for simplifying the pro* cedure as much as possible* MH. R HDKI» agreed that simplification of procedure was desirable&gt; but considered that 9 nevertheless, the Dominiana Governments must be ....:ai —T~^T/■N 3+ Majesty's aovemaent in the On!ted Kingdom ai^t he at liberty to denounce it without consulting the Domini one, since His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have always retained the right to denounce their Commercial Treaties even when those treaties provide privileges to all Claeses of British subjects. The meeting considered, however, that the Bahrein Treaty was on a different basis from commercial treaties such as Mr. Clutterbuck and Mr. Jenkins had in view, and that, especially as it was desired to denounce not the whole of the Treaty but only that small part of it in which the Dominions were interested’ the Dominions Govemmtnte must be consulted. MR. DIXQR enquired whether some impersonal h form of note could not be used in modifying the Treaty in the sense proposed. In Mr. Pitsmaurice’e opinion this was a question of degree and he still considered that the decision of the Imperial Conference, quoted above, was difficult to surmount. In face of/O' of the anxiety of the India Office to simplify the procedure and to enable the Bahrein State to meet the financial crisis as soon as possible, it was agreed (a) that the Dominions Governments should be approached on much the same lines as were taken in April, and (b) that if they raised no objection, the necessary notification of the Trea ty would be effected by means of a note addressed to the fheikh* M*?. RrUDBiX, presumed that the suggested note would, as was the case in April, provide only for the temporai'y grant of tariff autonomy, KR« LAITHWAITK questioned this view and stated that what the Government of India and the India Office had in view was a permanent derogation from the treaty of 1861 and the grant of permanent tariff autonomy. He feared that, if it was now proposed only to grant temporary autonomy, the whole question would have to be referred back to India. Ml?. RKHDEL considered And the Dominions Office representatives agreed, that the Dominions/Dominions Governments would be less likely to raise difficulties if they were informed that only a temporary derogation was contemplated^ » Moreover, the situation in the Persian Gulf was very fluid, and it seemed desirable for His Majesty^ Government not to tie their hands any more than was necessary# He would therefore prefer that only temporary tariff autonomy should be accorded, but was not prepared to press the point if the India Office and Government of India felt strongly about it# MP. cTOKEfS having pointed out that, although provision might only be made for temporary tariff autonomy, there would be no time limit, so that in effect the result would probably be the same, HR, LAITKWAITK- said that he would have to consult his higher authorities and perhaps also the Government of India# 8IF. f.

The meeting was attended hy Foreign Office, Board of Trade, Dominions Office and India Office. 2. There was very considerable discussion as to the position of the Dominions, which it is perhaps unnecessary to record here. Briefly the general sense of the conclusions reached hy the meeting was as follows:- (a) That the formula suggested in the Board of Trade letter of 16th august on P.Z.4976 was the simplest method of disposing with the proposed amendment of the Treaty and that it had the great advantage of avoiding difficulties with the Dominions (and with the U.K.) which might arise from an instrument covering the special position of India only (compare the Government of India's telegram of 27th June on P.Z.3819). (b) That the balance of advantage lay with making such modification as was contemplated by an exchange of notes, to be so worded as not to offend Dominion susceptibilities or give rise to a demand from the Dominions that separate notes should be exchanged in respect of them. (c) That in dealing with the Dominions the |procedure adopted last April should be adopted, viz. tney should be infoimed that the Government of India recommended that in consideration of the difficulties oi this small state tariff autonomy (the scale is 8/:J 1 214 n '000 discussed/discussed below) should he granted to Bahrein and that unless the Dominion Governments saw any objection after a reasonable period in which they could i express their opinion, proposed to take the necessary action. It was generally agreed after considerable argument that there was no way out of info m-ing- the Dominions, since the modification of the Treaty would take away a right enjoyed at the moment by Dominion Nationals who were British subjects, but in deference to the arguments in favour of that course, the interested Departments agreed to make the consultation of an informal character, as described. It was also agreed that, subject to the views of the Government of India, it would be reasonable to make provision of the type suggested in Colonel Powle's Despatch of 5th August, on P.Z.4981/32. 3. The Foreign Office intimated at the same time that they saw great advantage in releasing i Bahrein temporarily only from her obligations under the Treaty of 1861. It would ease matters with the Dominions, for the procedure could be much less rigid and there would be less likelihood of their raising difficulties. It would be much easier to bring Colonel Powle’s point in in any exchange of notes (Instead, as would otherv/ise be necessary, of having a parallel exchange of letters providing that the Sheikh should be guided by the Resident’s advice) and there was in actual practice no special limit to the period of a 'temporary' arrangement.

Suggestion has been made that particularly in view of consider ations in Bowie’s despatch 543-3 of 5th August to you halance of advantage rests with temporary remission of duties only.

As the result of discussion referred to above H.L.G. think that most satisfactory method of giving effect to proposed modification of Treaty is amendment of first sentence of x^rticle 4 to read as follows;- rt British subjects of every denomination it is understood may reside in and carry on their lawful trade/trade in the territories of Bahrein, ;i goods being subject to no other or higher uuties than those imposed upon any goods of the same kind.” This will avoid difficulties which may otherwise arise with Dominions while leaving all parties to Treaty in the same relative position as before. I trust Government of India will agree. 3. On receipt of your views Dominions will be consulted, procedure adopted last April being followed. 4.

Subject to your views point raised in Powle‘s despatch of 5th August 543-3 seems a good one and might be covered if temporary tariff autonomy only is granted in actual note or, if you still think balance of advantage rests with permanent autonomy, in simultaneous exchange of letters In uhich Sheikh would undertake to be guided by advice of Resident in any action taken by him.

IMPORTANT. Sir, With reference to your letter (P.Z.3819/32) of the 21st July addressed to the Foreign Office with regard to the proposed grant of tariff automony to Bahrein and the consequent modification of Article IV of the Bahrein Treaty of 1861, I am directed hy the Board of Trade to state, for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, that they have given consideration to the suggestion made in paragraph 4 of that letter that imports from India should have secured to them perpetual most-favoured-nation treatment in Bahrein while imports from other parts of the Empire might possibly not be accorded the right to receive a similar privilege. The Board realise that India has by far the greatest single interest in the trade of Bahrein.

V r\ At the same time the Board appreciate the fact that | ; r\ it would not be possible to attempt to secure a concession for goods from all parts of the Empire without first consulting His Majesty*s Governments in the Dominions, and that, on the other hand, to secure rights for the United Kingdom without giving an opportunity to the Dominions to ask for similar rights might equally lay His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom open to criticism from other parts of the Empire. It seems to the Board, therefore, that the choice lies between accepting the proposal of the Government of India that the concession of perpetual most-favoured-nation treatment should be enjoyed only by Indian goods and producing some formula to secure that the present rights accorded by Article IV of the 1861 Treaty shoula be supersedea not by rights accorded to goods of a particular origin but by personal rights of the kind already conceded by that treaty. As the Secretary of State will be aware, the treaty gives no rights to British goods as such, but only to the goods of 'British subjects of every denomination'. It seems to the Board, therefore that the most satisfactorysolution of the difficulty might be to substitute for the words M only to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent in cash or in kind.”, at the end of the first sentence of Article IV, the words u to no other or higher duties than those imposed upon any other goods of the same kind”. The first sentence of Article IV, as amended, would then read as follows:- 'British subjects of every denomination, it is understood, may reside in, and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrein, their goods being subject to no other or higher duties than those imposed upon any other goods of the same kind'.

A. CLUTTERBUOfe,i / 5^' Minute Paper. Department. Under Article 4 of our treaty with Bahrein of 1861 the Shaikh is precluded from imposing a tariff in excess of 5% ad valorem. In January of this year reports were received from the Political Resident to the effect that the financial situation in Bahrein had,to some extent as the result of the collapse of the pearl trade owing to general economic stringency elsewhere, become exceedingly serious and that it would be necessary if financial stability was to be preserved to make certain specified economies in the administration and also to increase the Customs revenue. The Political Agent had recommended in these circumstances the grant of full tariff autonomy to Bahrein and his recommendations were supported by the Political Resident. 2 .The Government of India were reluctant to go so far as the grant of complete tariff autonomy, and recommended instead an increase in the tariff on certain specified luxury articles from 5^ to 7^ as a temporary measure. They were of opinion that the State should be advised to make a similar all-round increase in other articles. (Their recommendation,which was not very clearly phrased, was not understood here and was taken as applying to luxury articles only). After discussion with the Foreign Office,His Majesty’s Government approved the increase suggested in respect of luxury articles only. It subsequently proved that both the Shaikh and the Financial Adviser were strongly opposed to a flat rate increase on all articles for reasons given in para.4 of the despatch from the Political Resident of 13th May, on P.Z.3071/32. 3. The financial situation continues to be very serious and the deficit during the current year amounts to/ :)5a 3000 5 31to approximately Rs.120,000. Rs.28,000 in all can be saved as the result of the administrative economies referred to in para.l above. But a serious deficit still remains. In these circumstances the State have put forward a fresh request for permission to increase the .tax on luxury articles from 7-£% to 1($, and on tobacco and liquor to a maximum of 15$, a proposal the acceptance of which is calculated to bring in an additional Rs.48,000 in a full year. The Resident strongly urges that the State should be granted full tariff autonomy^for the reasons set out in paras.4 to 11 of his despatch of 13th May. These reasons are, I submit, convincing, and they have been accepted by the Government of India who support his recommendation. 4. The case for the action proposed is, I think, a good one and it is unnecessary to elaborate the arguments in support of it urged by the Political Resident. I submit, in these circumstances that we may concur with the Government of India as to the desirability of granting tariff autonomy to Bahrein. But if a permanent modification of this type is to be made in the Treaty of 1861, it is desirable that it should be made by means of a formal Instrument such as a Protocol. It will be for consideration (and on this the Foreign Office will have to advise us) whether such an Instrument, if the necessity for it is accepted, should be drawn up on behalf of the various Governments of the British Commonwealth (compare para. 2 of Foreign Office letter of 24th March on P. Z.1909/32). Whatever the form of this the M.F.N. treatment to be provided must extend to the whole Empire and cannot be specified as being in respect of India/Minute Paper. Department.

The case for the grant of full tariff autonomy to the State of Bahrein is exhaustively examined, in Sir Hugh Biscoe’s despatch of 13th May, the recommendations in which are supported by the Government of India. Sir Samuel Hoare, in the light of the arguments adduced, shares the views of the Resident and the Government of India, and is of opinion, subject to any comments which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may wish to offer, that the case for the grant of tariff autonomy to Bahrein is in present circumstances conclusive. 3. When it was recently decided as a temporary measure to permit the 't4 State of Bahrein to raise thetr customs duties on luxury articles from/from 5^ to 7-^, Sir John Simon expressed the opinion that if effect was given to this decision hy a &lt; modification of the Treaty of 1861 hy a Protocol or other form of Instrument it might he held that such Instrument should he drawn up on hehalf of the various Governments of l the British Commonwealth (Foreign Office letter of 24th March 1932, No.E.1353/782/91). It was ultimately decided that, in the special circumstances of the case, ♦ a formal Instrument was unnecessary. In the present instance, however, as a permanent modification of the customs provisions of the Treaty of 1861 is contemplated, the Secretary of State is disposed to think that t • formal modification hy a Protocol or other similar Instrument will he desirable. He would he glad of Sir t John Simon 1 s views on this point and also on the question whether, and if so to what extent, it is necessary to associate His Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions with any such Protocol 4. A further point on which the c Secretary of State would he glad of 9 the observations of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, is the Government of India’s proposal that the/Draft (313' Paper. Department. the grant of complete tariff autonomy to Bahrein should he subject to the definite condition that imports from India will never be subjected to any higher duty than that applied to articles of a like nature imported from ary other countly. As Sir John Simon is aware, Bahrein*s principal r customer within the Empire is India ( cp. the D.O.T. Heport on Economic Conditions in the Persian Gulf, 1929). The United Kingdom also has a definite interest in Bahrein trade. But none of the Dominions, so far as can be seen, have any commercial interest in the Islands of any importance, though it is, of course, the case that the Bahrein c Petroleum Company is registered in Canada. In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that commercial agreements are not necessarily drawn on behalf of the Empire at large and that such agreements confined to India are not unusual (cp. e.g. the Commercial Agreements between India and Japan (190$), Greece (1926) and Poland (1931), all of which provide for complete most favoured nation treatment) Sir Samuel Hoare, as at present/ / ✓ 4' 5000 1.32present advised, and subject to the observations of Sir John Simon, is disposed generally to agree with the i Government of India’s proposals on this point. 5. The procedure to be adopted to give effect to the modifications now under consideration must, to some extent, depend on the decisions as to the participation of the Dominions Governments in the Instrument abrogatingfXrti'cTe IV of the TreatyJGS/TPCN/UM (S3 groupe) 3315 DEC VPHER OF TKL£GHAM.

Bahrein tarlfffio 2, We are generally In agreement with the Political Resident 4 e views. On political grounds, we should prefer grant of complete tariff autonomy, and thereby gain some credit which will not be secured by concession of right to charge increased duties on particular commodities to meet financial difficulties^ As pointed out by the Resident. Imports from India are mainly necessaries, duties on which cannot be Increased materially, for economic reasons. We accordingly recommend that State be granted complete tariff autonomy on the definite condition that imports from India will never be subjected to any higher duty than that applied to articles of a like nature imported from any other country^Extract from letter from ^ol.Blscoe to Mr.Walton dated 30th March 1932. I am not at all happy about Bahrein. The State is confronted with a deficit of .over a lakh and the only economies suggested up to date amount to only Es 43,000 in a full year and much less durirg the coming year, and even this the G of I are trying to whittle down. They have written to me asking whether it is really saXe to abolish the Indian police. 1 replied saying that, while some slight risk is involved, the ^tate simply cannot afford to keep them. As regards the tariffs I see that they objectb to my proposal to giving the State tariff autonomy and this at a time when they are themselves raising their own tariffs to enormous figures. My own opinion is that it is grossly unfair in the Year of Grace 1932 to tie these wretched little Arab Shaikhdoms down to 5% tariffs, and then say that as a fav our we will as a t emporary measure allow them to increase their r&amp;tes to ?£%• As I said to Hoare the other day our policy in the Gulf seems to be to grovel on the one siofe and to bully on the other. I do hope that you people will take up the question with India, and point out th&amp; these tariff restriction clauses are really quite out of keepimg with the spirit of the present age. I am all for hitting a Shaikh sha^rply if he is naughty; I am not for keeping him in financial bondage, which * regard as an unworthy policy.

In his letter i5io,C/9 of 17th January 1932, which was forwarded with ay despatch referred to above, the * olitical • • • •1 olltic&amp;l Agent while atating that it was the intention of the Btate to raise the customs duty from to Iby*, asked that the State should be granted tariff autonomy, and this request 1 supported. It is, however, a somewhat serious modifieation of our treaty rights, anu 1 did not advance at tne time detailed arguments in support of it and the Crovernment of India did not approve of the proposal. the itate, however, have now made a further request, namely, tnat they should ue permit leu to enhance the custoiae duty on luxury erticlea to 10^ instead of and to 1$» on tobacco and liquor. It is estimrted that the additional revenue from these sources will produce about Ra.4b,000, while, as mentioned above, economies in tne police will produce another v8.20,000, making i.s.da,000 in all. Further shaikh Isa’s health has been exceedingly bad of late and Doctor i,'aaie of the American Mission told me that he thought there was little likelihood of his living much lon-er. He has an allowance of »s.5,000 per mensem, i.e. is.60,000 per annum, and if this also can be saved there will then be some prospect of balancing the budget in the near future. On, the other h*-nd it is clear that without the increase in the tariff for which permission is now sou^t there is no possibility of doing so, anc the Btate will have to live on its reserves until tneae are exhausted. It will be a race between the return of better times and the exhaustion of the reserves, and having regard to the fact that ahrain depends entirely on a luxury trade, namely, the sale of pearls, which will probably revive but slowly, there is little doubt which will occur first. *• ’ ow I would venture to ask whether the question of the grant to this small Principality of tariff autonomy could not be re-considered. The Govern »nt of India in their telegram ho. 715 of the 5th 'larch 1932 recommended a flat rate of increase on »!1 articles. To this the Jh&amp;ikh and the Financial Adviser are «oth strongly opposed. At the present t irae a large portion of tfci population are on the brink of starvation and there is a great of unemployment and . nything which might conceivablyi -3- increaae even to aome small extent the cost of living *ould tell heavily upon them. The Political Agent writes: ** 1 believe that, email though the addition is, it would prove a very heavy burden, particul*',rly to nakhudaa, who have to provision large numbers of boats. lost of &gt;;heee men are having the greatest difficulty in fitting out boats this year, and this additional impost mi^ht well prove the last straw for uiany. the great majority of the inhabitants of Bahrain are desperately poor, and any increase in the price of necessities of life would bring them still nearer the starvation line. The custom© dues last year brou^Jit in ds.3,09,000, so an all round enhancement from to 7^ would, in theory, bring in another % lakhs. I feel certain, however, that the increase would lead to diminished consumption, and also probably to diving boats obtaining their supplies at a cheaper port, and the actual increased yield might be as low as a lakh of rupees 4 . f I have mentioned this to show that there are draw— backs to an all round flat rate of increase as suggested by tne Government at* India, and also to show that the Jtate fully realises the undesirability, at the present juncture at any rate, of taxing the necessities of life} there is therefore no likelihood of any concession snade to them in this respect being abused. further, there are two snfeguards* firstly, ae pointed out by Captain Prior in paragraph 8 of his letter referred to above, the merchant corumu^ity are extremely vocal in i&amp;hrain and would not hesitate to express themselves freely if the duties were ^reatly increased and this whole some check coupled wuth the advice ox the political resident should ensure that this privilege vma not abused. Secondly, the Bahrain Government has always to bear in mind that high duties -iiay divert trade to cheaper ports. For Instance a certain ••..certain proportion of the su&amp;ar now imported into tne / rab coast certainly finds its way ultimately into Persia* and this will inevitably be the case so lon^ as the i ersian f -*ovori*» aieiit impose exti*ejuiely hio^t duties on sugar* /'t pros^nt a tS reat deal of this sugar comes, in Uie first instance, irom Bahrain, but if the Baiu*ain aovernjaenr, imposed high duties on sugar, it would probably be diverted to &gt;ebal ana the same thing applies to :aany other articles* ^ s mentioned ab ve by the political Agent, the naichudas fitting out pearling boats would certainly obtain supplies elsewhere ii the cost of the necessities of life was raised in Bahrain* 1 have shown, therefore, I think, that there is in practice little risk of abuse of any concession that may be made to the rahrain *»tat&amp; in this connection* 6* 1 would however venture to support r^y request by arguments based on somewhat wider ^rounds* ifirstly, it seems to me that to hold these small principalities in financial bondage on the strength of treaties entered into many years ago, when conditions were very different, is opposed to toe spirit of the times. fhen at ary rate we could point to toe fact that the Government of India themselves only had a revenue tariff, anti that Great Britain was a free-trade country* e practised what we preached* ihis can iiardly be said to be trie case now* 7* Secondly, any person residing in the *ersian Gulf, as 1 do, cannot help being struck with the ^reat difference between the great regard sirown to iersian susceptibilities and, if I may say so, the soiaewhat scanty regard bhnwn to Arab susceptibilities. To i ersia we have accorded tariff autonomy and we have also accepted in the case of that country the unilateral denunciation of treaties* fo the Arab5- 4r)3 Arab Principalitias wm grant grudgingly «ren ai&amp;all ocnoesaions* The only explanation is that in the one case we are dealing with a relatively large power and in the other case with small men, an explanation which, if 2 may say so, hardly redounds to our credit* 8* Thirdly, X do not see what practical advantage we gain by insisting on our strict treaty rights in the matter of tariff, while on the other hand we certainly incur &amp; certain amount of odium by doing so* The bulk of British and Indian imports into this State consists of rice, coffee, tea, and a certain amount of piece-goods* Sugar though shown in the Trade Report as Indian because It is imported from India is seldom of Indian orgin* There isi|however 9 no likelihood of the duties on these necessities of life being increased at the present time and ample safeguards against it, and even should a small increase be imposed when more prosperous years eome it would certainly not be sufficient in any way to restrict consumption and therefore would not affect British or Indian trade* 9* Finally, these rigid tariff reetriotions do Impose difficulties on the local administration* Ones a flat rate of duty is abandoned and differential rates imposed on different classes of articles, the rates of duty imposed sn at first at any rats must be mors or less experimental* It may be found that some articles will bear a heavier rate while others will not bear the rate imposed* Com&amp;eroial conditions ehangs and prices fluctuate, and they may necessitate a re adjustment of tariff from time to time* If the powers of the State are rigorously limited the scope for adjustments is very small* 10* X mentioned above that 1 thought ws were by our present • • • •k present polio/ incur sing a certain amount of odiium The Rulers and people oi’ these Utates are eeare that the Government of India have themselves raised their tariff in many oases to very high figures* They are aware that His Majesty's Government have also imposed duties) they know that practically the only source of revenue in their State is customs and that their States are on the verge of insolvency« and yet despite this their hands are tied by antiquated treaties from which they cannot escape* It is undoubtedly the subject of adverse comment* 11* I would therefore venture to ask whether we could not now relax these bonds and authorise the Bahrain Government to levy such duties as seem to it good* If, however, this view is not accepted, 2 would request that the consent of His Majesty's Government may be obtained to an increase of the tariff on luxury articles to 10% and on tobacco and liquor to lb&gt;.

We did not deliberately vary the G. of I.'s recommendation, but^we misunderstood the words m para. 2 of their telegram of 5th March '... inform Bahrein Govt, that H.M.G. agree to this departure ( viz ., an increase in the duty on eertairr luxury articles to Wo) from the provisions of Art. 4 of the treaty as a temporary measure, and have instructed Pol. Agent to advise them to make a similar all-round increase in the tariff rate”. It occurred to us that the meaning of this might be what it now turns out to have been; but the meaning was not obvious, in view of the fact that it had been stated that the intention of the Bahrein Govt, was confined to raising the duty on the- luxury articles, and m view of the actual wording of the reference to Art. 4 in the G. of I.'s telegram; an/ Cl? 500(1 1.32an increase on non-luxury articles is equally a departure from Art. 4, but in the telegram the reference to that article was brought in in connection only with the increase on luxury articles. There appeared to be two other nossible interpretations of the telegram (1) that an increase the treaty limit of 5% was intended on non-luxur y articles (if any) which mi^it not already be paying that rate; (2) that besides acquiescing in the departure from the treaty (which of course applies only to the goods of British subjects) so far as 4^ luxury articles were concerned, it was to be made clear ex maiore to the Bahrein Govt, that the higher duty on such articles should be charged also on foreign goods. Personally I thought that the last explanation was the probable one, and am therefore responsible / / for the K misunderstanding. I am sorry that it should have occurred. Perhaps now we had better leave matters as they stand and see whether the increase on th-o- luxury articles, which is all that the/mm m Department. the Bahrein Govt, intended to make, proves to be sufficient for their purpose. If it is found desirable to make a similar increase on non- luxury articles we can, upon hearing from you, put the matter up again to the F.O. and D.O. Yours sincerely. tSd.) J. C.

Sir With reference to your letter P.Z. 1458/32 of the 15th March in regard to the Bahrein tariff, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he sees no objection in principle to the proposal of the Government of India that, in view of the present financial situation, the Bahrein customs duties on such luxury articles as silks, perfumes, motorcars, etc. should as a temporary measure be raised from five per cent to seven and a half per cent. 2. As regards the procedure necessary for the consequential revision of Article 4 of the Bahrein Treaty of 1861, the Secretary of State is advised that it will be necessary to consult the Dominion Governments and, if the proposed modification of the Treaty were effected by a protocol or other form of instrument, it might be held that it should be drawn up on behalf of the various Governments of the British Commonwealth. It would, however, in Sir John Simon’s opinion, be sufficient if, after the Governments of the Dominions had been apprised of the matter, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf were to address to the Sheikh of Bahrein a note stating that he had been instructed (without specifying the Government from which these instructions emanated) to acquiesce in the proposed temporary increase s The Under Secretary of State of customs duties on luxury articles. 1 ' 3./ India Office' ^ .

Sir John Simon presumes that, before final instructions are sent to Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe in the matter, the Secretary of State for India will consider whether the proposed increase in the Bahrein customs duties could be considered to be an infraction of the 1920 Agreement with King x Ibn Saud regarding Bahrein duties on goods destined for Nejd, which formed the subject of India Office letter No. P.Z. 1589/32 of the 12th March. 5.

Unfortunately Caotain Prior f s anticipation that the current year would see a further deficit has been realised, and it is essential that further measures of economy should be adopted. 2. During my recent visit to Bahrain I had a long discussion with the Political Agent and the Adviser regarding the financial situation of the Principality. Mr. BeIgrave informed me that the expenditure was now exceeding the revenues by about Rs. 8,000/- a month and the situation was deteriorating and that the time had now come when, in his opinion, it was essential to take further steps to reduce expenditure and increase revenue. At the beginning of the present financial year (the Arabic year starts in May at present) the State had a balance in the Bank of Rs. 1,13,856, in addition to its reserve of Rs. 3,00,000. This sum is now exhausted, partly on current expenditure and partly on caoital expenditure, namely the extension of electric light to Kuharraq, which it is hoped will ultimately produce revenue, and it will be necessary to draw on the reserve. Finally y four measures were proposed, which it ENOLOBURt IN I INDIA FOREIGN hoped would meet the immediate necessities of the 21] ^ Letter 'situation and Mr. Belgrave said he would submit them for 0at8d n FEB. 1332 n 29 FEB to tlie Deputy Ruler. These measures were as follows:- - — -- r lu-a-* L .nt * ■ ffc. 1 —-■'432) 2 (a). That on the expiration of his present contract in September next, the services of Captain Parke should not be renewed and that the Adviser should hold charge of the police in addition to his own duties for a year at any rate as he has done when Captain Parke has been on leave. (bJ. That the Indian police should be replaced by local men as their contracts expire. (c) . That application should be made to the Government of India for permission to increase the customs dues to by a small extent, and (d) . That a small land tax (Cakat) should be levied on agricultural produce. 4. I suggested to Mr. 3elgrave that if Shaikh Hamad approved of these proposals he should submit them to the Political Agent, who in turn would address me on the subject, in order that I might refer them to the Govern ment of India. I have now received an official communi cation from the Political Agent, of which I enclose a li o» v — 9. 17.1.32. copy for the information of the Government of India. 5. As regards the reduction of the appointment of Commandant of Police, I would invite a reference to the correspondence ending with i'oreign and Political Depart ment letter l\o. P.164-P/29, dated the ISth JanuBry 1931, in which the approval of the Government of India was accorded to the retention of Captain Parke for a further period of at least one year. Captain Parke has, I know, been looking about for an appointment outside Bahrain for some time past but informed me that he would, in any event, stay over the summer, when he was acting for Mr. Belgrave, who was on leave. He himself is proceeding on leave in the spring and his contract expires in September, and having regard to the need for economy I agree with the Political Agent(s proposal that it should not be renev/ed and that the post should, for the timer n- § 4% time 'being, 'be left vacant. Mr. Belgrave tias twice, for a period of six months on each occasion, held char^ of the Police in addition to K.-&gt;- s work and informs me that he can do so in f * e, though possibly there may 'be some slight loss of efficiency. In view of the necessity for economy, however, this must 'be faced. The difficulty will arise two years hence when ^r. Belgrave goes on leave. It has 'been customary in the past for Captain Parke to act for him and it is essential to have someone in Bahrain who can perform the duties of the Adviser during Mr. Belgrave’s absence. In any case, however, I think the post of Commandant of Police may 'be left vacant for a year and a half and the question of appointing some other officer to it can be reconsidered in the autumn of 1933. 6. As mentioned in my telegram Bo.X-2 1, d ated the 21st January 1932, the Bahrain government have already ! informed Captain Parke that it is not their intention to extend his contract. It was explained to me that they had done this, as after the auestion had 'been discussed with Shaikh Hamad, they thought it Better to let Captain Barke know without delay, as the matter would certainly have got round to him from private sources. 7. The Bahrain police force at present consists 1 we* of 48 Indians, 57 AraBs and 121 naturs. The latter are local men mho are unarmed and merely do watch and ward duties in the Bazaar. The regular police form what would Be termed in India an armed reserve. The Indians are undouBtedly costly since a sepoy draws i . 35/- pay, plus rations, which fbrmerly cost Bs. 15/- But now cost aBout Bs . 10/-, plus uniforms and passages to their homes every two years. The xxraBis ft iFm jr4 Arafts draw Hs. 25/- plus rations and uniforms while the nature get Es. 25 and no extras. The ohiject of peace among the heterogeneous elements which comprise the population of these Islands in the event^ of riots. The number of Indians, however, has 'been gradually reduced to 43 and the Ara'bs increased to 57, and I am informed that the latter are now proving satisfactory and it is iDelieved that they could 'oe relied upon in ap emergency. However, the various elements of the Bahrain community have for some years now lived together in peace and amity and the danger of intercommunal rioting has certainly dimini The risk therefore of having a force composed entire ly of AraBs is not a great one and the financial situation justifies, or rather nece^sJLiaJ^s, running a slight risk. As the Political Agent points out, the substitution of Arabs for the remaining Indians would effect a saving of about 3s. 6,000/- in addition to the cost of passages and leave pay. 9 8. Under Article 4 of the Bahrain Treaty of 1861 the State is precluded from increasing its customs duties above As pointed out by the Political Agent, such a restriction is hardly in keeping with modern views in such matters and I support his pro*; posal that the State should be freed from this restri ction and be granted tariff autonomy, ^.s Captain Prior points out, the risk of abuse of this concession. I is slight since the mercantile community wields much influence and I think we could ensure that any advice which we tendered regarding the tariff would be accepted. It is the intention of the State only to 1 raise the duty on such articles as silks, perfumes, motor cars, etc. and to refrain from a.dditional taxes having Indians in the police force was t»o preserve t he shed though it has probably not entirely disappeared pnH on the necessaries of life. 9. As regards the advisability of imposing ♦zakat* I have not at present arrived at a definite con clusion. In principle the tax is legitimate and a recognised levy in liu hammed an countries. Whether, when the details are worked out, it will he found to he advisable to impose it in Bahrain, where special conditions prevail, I am not yet certain, and should therefore like to reserve my opinion regarding the imposition of zakat until the matter has been gone into jtn greater detail. 10. fhe great difficulty in balancing the Bahrain budget is the question of the allowances drawn by the ruling family. Till recently these allowances amount to 50$ of the total revenues of the State, namely 5 lakhs out of a revenue of 10 lakhs, a cut of 10$ has already been effected in Dhe family allowances with the full concurrence of shaikh Hamad. This has effected a saving of Bs. 50,000/- but even so, owing to the fall in revenue, the family allow ances amount now to 57$ of the total income of the State. A further cut is not feasible at present but it may be possible to effect some reduction on the demise of some of the present holders. ^ cut in the pay of all G-ovemment officials and a further cut in the A1 Khalifa allowances may be found necessary if the situation continues to deteriorate. 11. It is anticipated that these proposals in a full year would produce about Bs. 43,000. made up as follows :- Temporary abolition of the post of Commandant of Police. Substitution of ^rabs for Indians. Increase of customs dues Zakat, if imposed, about Total Bs . 14.000. 6 , 000 . 8,000 - 15.000. 4370007This will not enable the State to 'balance its 'budget and it will 'be necessary for them to draw on their reserve, which was created to ena'bie them to meet such a crisis as the present. Having regard to the present financial difficulties of all classed of the community increased taxation would not at the present juncture 'bring in much, and woulajoe greatly resented so long as substantial reserves were known to exist. I should he glad if I could receive early orders on these matters so that the State may be enabled to reorganise its finances without further delay.dopy of a letter lio.0/9 of 1932, dated Political Agency, Bahrein, the 17th January 1932, from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon’hle the Political Besident in the Persian ciulf, Bus hi re. I have the honour to say that the Bahrain (iovern- ment have not found it possible to meet current expend! ture by revenue despite drastic economies, the figures for the first six months of the Arabic year showing a deficit of Bs . 31,625/- on the budget estimates and a deficit of Bs. 110,420/- upon the figures of the first half year of 1349. 2. Bo further economy appears possible in the administration and building and similar non-productive expenditure has been reduced to a minimum. Bi^ excellency Shaikh Hamad has reviewed the situation and decided upon two economies and two sources of additional revenue. ^hree of these will require the concurrence of the ^dovernment of India, the fourth being a matter the Shaikh is compe tent to decide without further reference. The two measures of economy are the reduction of the appointment of Captain Parke and the suostitution of local men for the fifty remaining Indian Police. Captain Parke costs the State some Bs. 14,0J0/- per annum and local men could be secured .tor Bs • 25/- p©l me no (fin o.s compared with the Bs . 35/- now paid to the Indian Police thereby resulting in an annual saving of Bs. 6,CG0/- apart from a considerable sum now expended on passages and leave pay* 4* The two additional sources of revenue are increa sed Customs* dues on luxuries and the levy of zakat upon the date gardens. If the Customs* dues upn the former A \ were raised from 5/ / o to jp* an approximate additional re/onue of Bs. 3,000/- may be expected and a larger impost would notn not 1^3 likely to increase the figure. The yield of the zakat has not yet 'been calculated and it v/ill he very difficult to form an estimate for a Be venue Department as the term is understood in India does not exist in Bahrain. 5. Another economy that was considered was a cut in salaries over a certain amount, hut, since a 5/* cut would only produce a saving of some Bs. 500/- a month this is not being put into force at the moment, though^ it will he necessary later if conditions do not improve. 6. I consider that the proposals are practical and 1 recommend their adoption. Captain Parke has little to do save during the six months in every third year that he acts for Hr. Belgrave, and he does not seem able to give Hr. Belgrave as much assistance as one might have expected during the remainder of the time. His contract expires after the conclusion of his leave in September this year and it is proposed that his contract should simply not he renewed. His administration of the Indian Police has not impressed me and I consider tChat the State can do very well without his services until nr. Belgrave goes on leave in 1934. By that time the recrea tion or retention of the post of Assistant ^adviser could he reconsidered and the answer Y/ould probably he found in the state of the pearl market, which is the real ruler of Bahrain. 7. I heartily recommend the early disbandment of the Indian Police whose contracts expire during the summer of this year. The climate does not suit them or their wives, seve^f of whom have died, and their duties which consist of a ceaseless and wearisome tour of guard duties do little to retain their interest. They are growing steadily slacker and are by no means a credit to the Indian Army in which all at one time or another, -j received —3 received their training. The danger from the Dowasir, a consideration which lead to their formation, no longer exists, and local men, who are now available in suffi cient numbers owing to the local depression, could be trained without difficulty to carry out their duties. These men would be simpler in every way to deal with and would have the inestimable advantage of speaking Arabic, the ignorance of which has been a great drawback to the Punjabis. 8. As regards the increase in Jus toms* dues, I feel that the time has come when the State, subject to the advice of the Political Resident, should be allowed to fix such rates as it pleased. At a time when the Government of India, and for that matter, almost every cotintry in the world, are doubling and trebling duties that are already high, I feel that it is inequitable to bind a State like Bahrain that depends on its customs for nine-tenths of its revenue to a five per cent duty. The merchant community are extremely vocal in Bahrain and w r ouId not hesitate to express themselves freely if the duties were greatly increased, and this wholesome check, coupled with the advice of the Political Resident should ^ssure that this new privilege was not abused. Nevertheless, when returning prosper!tyAgain increased the Customs* dues to the high figures of past years it would be necessary to see that the Puling family, who \ already receive 57&gt; of the current revenue, did not appropriate the lion*s share of the enhanced taxation* 9. The zakat will infallibly be passed on by the owners of date gardens to their unfortunate tenantry, who already live near the starvation line but zakat is the only tax which is really lawful in the eyes of the strict L'uslim and a very high rate is collected by Bin 3a # ud in the Q,atif and Hofuf oases. Bis excellency proposes at present to levy *ashur*, i.e., a tenth of the4 the produce, and though this may te difficult to collect it will he infinitely preferable to a fixed rate expressed in rupees which hears hardly when dates fetch a low price as they do at the moment. Since His Excellency form of land tax exists I suggest that you should inform him that the proposal may he acted upon. 10. One point requires mention, no immediate economy will result from the reduction of u a ptain Parke's post or the substitution of local men for Indians since the he a time 7 ;hen both local men and Indians will have to he paid since the recruits will take time to train. The ultimate economy, however, is obvious. I request, there fore, that these tw r o proposals and the request for per mission to levy enhanced customs dues he referred to the Government of India, with your approval for an early de cision. The levy of saltat requires no reference, hut His Excellency will probably expect a word from you before putting it into force. former will receive full pay till September and there will -</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00012c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3736A</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00012c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3736A</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/22 'Persian Gulf, Bahrein.
