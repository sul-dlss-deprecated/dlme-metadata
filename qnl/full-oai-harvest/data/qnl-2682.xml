The reports, marked as secret, were sent to the Government of India, the India Office, and numerous diplomatic, political, and military offices in the Middle East. Most of the reports cover a two week period, though due to holidays and work pressures some cover an entire month.The reports are split into short sections that relate to a particular subject. Contained within the reports is intelligence on the following:shipping and the activities of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, and commercial transport companies such as Imperial Airways Limited;the movements of British and Foreign subjects, and Arab notables;the affairs of countries of the region, including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Persia [Iran], and the Trucial Coast;trade and the pearling and oil industries;the weather and climate.Folios 166-182 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000118#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
