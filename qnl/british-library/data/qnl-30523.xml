The Arabs, he said, would never be content until further Jewish immigration had ceased altogether and P&amp;xestine allowed to become an independent Arab State. He did not approve of the association of the American uovernment in Palestinian affairs on the ground that Jewish influence in America was too strong, in his opinion, for the Arab case to be impartially considered in that country. With his return to Muscat and the arrival of the school masters, a revival of local interest in the Palestine problem can be expected.

In 1944, one of the Sultan's askars was shot by a member of this tribe while attempting to effect an arrest.

No action was, however, taken by the Shaikh to hand over the murderer who fled to the hills immediately after the crime but who subsequently returned to his village.

The recent disclosure that a subordinate in the Con trol Department, Baud bin Sulaiman, had been forging the signature of the Director of this department, Saiyid Abdul Barri al Zawawi, and thereby deriving considerable benefit from the illegal sale of piecegoods from control department stocks, has raised considerable comment.

Local politicians have been listening the news broad cast on the position in Azer baijan with considerable interest. No one appeared to have the slightest doubt that RussAan troops would remain in this area after the expiry of the treaty period on March 2nd. Many are convinced that war with Russia is in evitable and point to Russian activities in Iran, Turkey and China in support of their views. 67. Trade connections with India cause political distur bances in that country to take precedence over discussion on Arabian affairs and in consequence the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy at Bombay and Karachi resulted in a sudden eva poration of interest in Palestinian and Egyptian affairs. The mutiny of the Indian Navy caused considerable anxiety in commercial circles and the price of gold showed a tempo rary rise. SMSUg- 68. Mr. R.K.

Local information is that his son, who is now in Muscat, is unlikely to succeed him and that the candidate most generally favoured is Shaikh Isa's cousin, Saleh bin Hamed. The death of Shaikh Isa marks the passing of one of the most colourful personalities in the history of Oman. Fanatically religious, and possessed of great energy and an unsurpassed gift for intrigue, he was instrumental in recreating the Imamate in 1913, and later in raising sufficient forces to extinguish the influence of the Sultanate in the interior and, by threatening the towns of Muscat and Mutrah during the 1914-1B war, to neces sitate the despatch of British forces to assist the Sultan in the protection of these towns. In 1920, as the result of his in fluence in the negotiations which led to the 'Treaty of Sib', the Imamate became virtually an independent itate. In more recent years Shaikh Isa's attitude towards the Sultanate mellowed considerably and he paid a number of visits to Muscat as the guest of the present Sultan. THE WEATHER. 91.

He said that the Municipality had devoted its chief attention during recent months to cleaning up Muscat. He said that he had prograwwed as far as he could with the work in Muscat and now proposed to divert his attention to Mutrah where there was much to be done. He added that sanitary affairs in Mutrah had been neglected for a considerable period and that he anticipated certain obstruction. In this connection he stated that there should be no differentiation between Muscat subjects and British subjects, and asked for my support, should he meet with obstruction from the British subjects. He said he particularly anticipated difficulty with the Khoja community who all live in one separate enclosed area. This area, he stated, had never been penetrated by Public Health Inspectors and was, he understood, in a deplorably insanitary condition. I agree in principle that if British subjects or British Protected Persons fail to comply with public health instructions, they should not be dealt with more leniently by the Consulate Court than Muscat subjects by the State courts. I advised, however, that he should take his fences slowly and said that I would like to be given plenty of previous notice of any steps he proposed to take in regard to the Khoja community's enclosed area. I suggested that any such action should3 be taken in conjunction with the elders of the Khoja community rather than by individual Public Health Inspectors. While it is probably true that the Khoja commimity's area is in a deplorably insanitary con dition, it is unlikely that it is much worse than any other part of Mutrah and since, it would un doubtedly cause considerable heart-burning if the Municipality devoted undue attention to them, I shall endeavour to see that Saiyid Tarik moves very slowly in the matter. The Khoja community had impressed me, within the short period I have been here, as being somewhat more surly and discontented than the other British communities. I have not yet been able to find out the cause for this. GWADUR . 388. Mr. K.R.

Considering it was a goodwill visit, it appeared that Captain Wolverton had taken surprisingly little trouble to learn anything of the history and customs of the country. The officers and men were however extremely efficient and smart and behaved with exemplary correctness throughout their stay which was undoubtedly successful. His Majesty's Consul called on Captain Wolverton soon after arrival and the latter returned the call at the Consulate, and then, accompanied by His Majesty's Consul, went on to call on Saiyid Shihab bin Faisal, the Sultan's Representative. Saiyid Shihab returned the call on board 'Hyman' the same morning receiving 13 guns salute on diparture. The State authorities were very anxious to show every courtesy to the first U.S. ship that visited Muscat for some 40 or 50 years and Saiyid Shihab entertained Captain Wolverton and officers at an Arab luncheon which was much appreciated by them.
