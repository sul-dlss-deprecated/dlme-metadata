They face slightly to the left, looking forward.The man on the right wears a dark-coloured robe, a pale-coloured, tasselled keffiyeh held in place by a dark-coloured agal and sandals. At his waist a janbiya can be seen emerging from his robes and he wears a ring on his little finger.The man on the left wears a pale-coloured outer-robe that is heavily embellished, perhaps embroidered, along the lapels over a white robe. On his head he wears a white turban with a dark-coloured cap. He wears polished leather shoes and he, too, wears a janbiya, which emerges from under his robe at the waist.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing it to take on a soft-shaded quality in places. In particular, the background has been substituted, though the mat on which they are seated remains.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XVIA circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower right corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000015#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
