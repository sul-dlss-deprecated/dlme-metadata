As it is approached, five hills are seen, 'like the five fingers of an hand when it is open'. There are some ancient buildings on the hills, and the present village, a short way from the hills, consists of five or six houses of mud with a few palm trees watered from springs. No one lives at Ambak during the winter, but in the summer a few people go there on account of the water.

McCLAUGHRY. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.lEXTRACTS FROM D.Q&gt; LETTER FROM GROUP CATTAIN R.E.SAUL* We left here on Tuesday to do the t^atar Reconnaissance and on arrival at Bahrein I found that Loch had made arrangements to transfer from the flying boats to the SHORE HAM** at Odaid, and was very vague as to the air programme thereafter# I suggested to him that it would be much better for the two sloops 'CHOREHAM' and 'BIDSFORD' to meet us at Doha at mid-day on the 9th, where we could have a conference with Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim Ath Thani and his representatives and go into the matter of the landing ground at Riyan to which Loch agreed. I sent a signal to this effect to the l.N.O* who also agreed and met us at Doha, in company with the 'BIDEFORD'. Provided permission was given I intended to mark out the landing ground with some lime I had brought for the purpose, and for one of the Wapitis of 84 Squadron to carry out a trial landing. However, the Shaikh’s son called on the S.N.O. on the afternoon of the 9th and apologised for the absence of his father, who, he said, was sick, and had gone out into the country to a place named A1 Quhaib, which is some 35 miles N.N.f. of Doha. Loch expressed his concern about the Shaikh’s illness, and offered to take the Ship’s doctor to see him, but we were immediately assured that it was a minor illness ana that he would be all right the following day. Having called this bluff, we then made arrangements to visit the Shaikh at A1 i^uhaib at 0600 hours on the morning of the 10th. Next morning the Shaikh sent two cars, one with escort, and Colonel Loch, Captain Browne of the ’’BIDEFORD”(as the S.N.O* had departed for Henjam the previous day) and myself proceeded to A1 Quhaih via Eiyan, passing the pro osed landing ground en route* We found the Shaikh lookin very healthy and fit, and after discussing everything hut the landing ground for some time. Loch eventually suggested the possibility of one of our aircraft landing at Hiyan to test the landing ground* The Shaikh immediately became animated, and refused the request, having his reasons ready, stating that he did not want aircraft to land at Kiyan, as there was no need for it and he feared an accident, for which he might be held responsible* Further, he said that when he had come to some agreement about the oil with the Companies concerned, and with us for protection, he would be prepared to let aircraft land, but I gather that this should not be construed into a definite promise* After further discussion he did eventually, though somewhat reluctantly, agree to us examining the landing ground at Riyan on the way back to Doha* The general impression I got at the Conference was that he expected to be asked to allow our aircraft to land in his territory, as his reasons against came out pat, and obviously other influences had been brought to bear on him, and he was playing for time* Loch thinks that his attitude was definitely less strongly against the idea of the landing ground than it was Ux tb -YvAt previously. l|; ^ After an exceedingly heavy Arabic lunch at 8 a.m* we started back to Doha, and half way back discovered we were being taken by a different track which missed the landing ground* Whether the driver had instructions to do this is a matter/matter of conjecture - we insisted on going back to the road we came by and eventually sto /ped and examined the landing ground site# The country in general consists of undulating stony desert, with occasional patches ol thorn, but the site inspected is a long shallow depression in which water probably stands after rain* This has produced a mud seepage which has hardened, making a very good landing surface of hard mud, no crust, and will take all types of aircraft* It is about 600 y«rds long and 200 to 300 yards wide in places, with the prevailing wind up and down* There are a few jackal holes, and care should be taken to avoid them unless they have teen previously filled in# The main Doha-Hiyan track runs across the site, but is not an obstruction* I am inclined to think that the fact that the proposed site for a landing ground is, so to speak, outside the Shaikh's own front door, influenced him in his refusal, and if it were possible to obtain another site further away he might more readily agree* I kept a careful eye for any other likely site, but saw nothing* As I said, the general nature of the country is undulating stony desert, and it might be possible to select a site near Doha, where labour is available to clear the stones, but it would be a biggish job*THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

IN 1873 the Ottoman Government advanced a claim to sovereignty over the whole of the area that had at one time been in possession of the Imams of the Yemen, including tribal areas in South-West Arabia, with the rulers of which the British Government were in special treaty relations. The British Government, in reply, maintained that the rulers of these tribes were independent. There followed a period of frequent encroachments by Turkish authorities into the protectorate, of British representations and Turkish assurances, and of British measures to protect the tribes, until, in 1901, the Government of India and the Ottoman Government both proposed that the frontier should be demarcated. In 1902 frontier commissfoners met and carried out demarcation on the ground. The results were embodied in three protocols of 1903, 1904 and 1905 respectively. Formal ratification was delayed until 1914, the agreement arrived at in 1905 being completed and ratified in the Anglo- Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914. The text will be found in C.P. 10517. Ratifications of this convention were exchanged at London on the 3rd June, 1914. 2. After the war, the Imam of the Yemen refused to recognise the frontier agreed upon in the 1914 convention, and revived the ancient claims of his predecessors. A situation similar to that in the last part of the 19th century subsequently prevailed, until a treaty was concluded with the Imam at Sanaa on the 11th February, 1934, which included a mutual undertaking providing for the maintenance of the situation in regard to the frontier as it existed on the date of signature of the treaty,^) and for the prevention of any violation of this frontier pending negotiations for its final settlement. These negotiations are to be initiated before the expiration of the present treaty, which is to remain in force for forty years. This treaty has not yet been ratified. Persian Gulf Principalities. 3. In March 1911 the Ottoman Government formally intimated to His Majesty’s Government their wish that a precise definition might be reached as to the respective position of the two countries, commercially and politically, in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Government being concerned in view of their special treaty relations with the Arab rulers on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf. The ensuing negotiations resulted in the signature at London of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913 (see C.P. 10515). This convention, inter alia, recognised Koweit as an autonomous Kaza of the Ottoman Empire, and established its boundaries, and contained Turkish renunciation of rights in Qatar. The boundary of the Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd was not delimited in detail, apart from where it marched with that of Koweit, but was described generally in the convention as a line commencing at a point on the Persian Gulf a little to the south of Uqair, opposite the Island of Zakhnuniyah, running due south into the Ruba-al-Khali desert, until it met parallel 20° N., after which it turned and continued in a south-westerly direction in a straight line to meet Lakmat-esh-Shub, the most easterly point reached in the delimitation of the Aden Protectorate boundary. p) One of the conditions attached by His Majesty’s Government to their consent to the conclusion of the treaty was that certain portions of the territory of the Aden Protectorate which were still in Yemeni occupation should be evacuated. The British Besident at Aden reported that prior to signature of the treaty this condition had been fulfilled. His Majesty’s Government have reserved their right to claim the district of Rubeiatein, which at present remains in the Imam’s possession. 7435 [81 gg—2] B'2 4. This convention was not ratified, but, with the exclusion of Turkey from the Arabian peninsula, His Majesty’s Government have a y „ ^ I frontiers of Turkey’s successors, Ibn Saud ami the Imam 0 Hcfiued in the I be confined within the limits of the former Ottoman Empne as defi e the 1 conventions of 1913 and 1914.

On the other hand, Great Britain had repudiated 1 urkish claims to sovereignty over Bahrein eighteen times, and had frequently 1 informed the Porte that the Ottoman claim to sovereignty over El Katr could not be, and never had been, recognised by Great Britain. “ The answer as regards the Aden Convention would seem to be tnat, although it was not ratified until the 3rd June, 1914, an arrangement was made for its enforcement pending ratification. Apart from this, however for many years the attitude of His Majesty s Government had been t a they did not acknowledge the title of the Porte to the country lying at or beyond the mouth of the Red Sea. ^ v ‘ ‘ As regards the Hadramaut, all the tribes had long been under Bi itisn protection, and the leading sheikhs stipendiaries of the British Government. “ It is to be noted that, although Koweit was regarded by His Majesty s Government as an autonomous Kaza of the Turkish Empire, the Sheikh oi Koweit had undertaken to grant an oil concession in his territory only to a nominee of the British Government. Koweit may therefore for present purposes be regarded as outside Turkish territory. 5. Since the war, with the exception of the frontier between Nejd and Koweit. which was defined in the Nejd-Koweit Agreement of the 2nd December, 1922. no definition has been reached in agreement with Ibn Saud of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Nejd. Library memorandum of the 17th October. 1927 [E 4330/104/65/1927], dealing with the frontier between Nejd and Qatar, contains the following paragraphs :— “ By article 11 of the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. the boundary between El Katr and Nejd was described as a line running from the extreme end of the gulf opposite the Island of Zakhnuniyah due soutn to Ruba-al-Khali (see blue line on map 2 attached to the convention of 1913). “ By article 6 of the treaty of the 26th December, 1915, between Great Britain and the Sultan of Nejd, the latter promised to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of El Katr. “ During a visit which Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner at Bagdad, paid to Ibn Saud in November and December 1922, the question ot the status of El Katr came under notice in connexion with a project for the grant of an oil concession for a tract of Nejd territory. Sir P. Cox, who found that in his discussions with the engineer representing the aspirant concessionnaires Ibn Saud had apparently included the Katr peninsula within the area for which he was prepared to negotiate a concession, at once took Ibn Saud to task, reminded him that he had nothing to do with ( 2 ) That is south or east of the line dividing Nejd and El Katr.

It was assumed in the Foreign Office that this request was connected with the operation of the Hasa Oil Concession by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and it was held to be desirable that the position of His Majesty s Government with regard to the boundaries mentioned should be made clear to the United States Government, and that the United States Embassy at Angora should be put in possession of all the relevant treaty texts. After consultation with the &gt; ? , India Office, a despatch was sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora on the 22nd March, 1934 [E 1839/1206/91/1934], instructing Sir P. Lorame to com- ~ , , municate a copy of the 1913 convention to the United States Embassy, and to show them a copy of the 1914 convention, which, unlike the 1913 convention, had been published. ' In this despatch the view was definitely taken that the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of the 1913-14 line had now become independent States, could not be regarded in the view of His Majesty’s Govern ment as in any way affecting the status of the territories on the other side of that line, which His Majesty’s Government regarded as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Succession State of Saudi Arabia and the territories of South- Eastern Arabia with which they were in special relations. Sir P. Lorame was instructed to call the attention of the United States Embassy to the fact that the 1913 convention was not ratified, but to point out to them, in support of the view taken by His Majesty’s Government of the validity of the line laid down therein, that that line was mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted in article 3 of the 1914 convention, which had been ratified. 7. One point arising out of the question of the 1913-14 frontier line is whether that line should be regarded as merely establishing the limits of baudi Arabian territory or whether it also lays down the boundaries of the territories of Arab rulers with whom His Majesty’s Government are in special treaty relations. After Mr. Philby’s expedition into the Ruba-al-Khali in 1932, the Saudi Arabian paper, the Umm-al-Qura, in publishing an account of the expedition, advanced a claim to Saudi Arabian sovereignty over the districts visited. The Foreign Office then decided not to take the initiative in examining questions of territorial claims in the Ruba-al-Khali. The question of the territorial limits of Qatar has, how ever, arisen in connexion with the operation of the Hasa Oil Concession (see paragraph 6 above). Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson, Political Agent at Koweit, who was present with Sir Percy Cox at the Uqair negotiations with Ibn baud in November and December of 1922 already referred to, has furnished a report E 279/279/91/1934] on the discussions which then took place regarding the Nejd-Qatar boundary. According to this report, Ibn Baud produced Hunter's map of Arabia 1-inch to 32 miles, on which was marked in blue pencil the area which he proposed to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate for their con cession. This area included the whole of the Hasa Province and the Qatar peninsula, the south-western and southern boundary of the concession being marked by a line drawn down the Wadi Faruq as far as Jaw-ad-Dukhan and then turning east from there to Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin on the coast. Sir Percy Cox marked in red pencil on the map a line from Jaw-ad-Dukhan to Dohat balwa, saying to Ibn Saud : “That is the line,’’ and crossed out the incorrect line marked in blue. It will be noticed that the line marked by Sir P. Cox was not in accordance with that laid down in the 1913 convention. As it was not clear whether Sir P. Cox intended to indicate the frontier between Nejd and Qatar or whether he was merely warning Ibn Saud against assuming sovereignty east of the red line on the map, and as Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson’s report (written more than ten years after the event) contained nothing to show that mention was [81 gg—2] b 2V.O ( E. 723/ ^ -p fi-io 101 ^ r«nn\ r pntinn 11110 it was considered desirable to consult fen P. Cox onthesubTect In a discussion held at the India Office on the 20th February 1934 ! ‘F 1302/279/91/19341 Sir P. Cox expressed Ins conviction that the 1913 con- vition line was never mentioned during the 1922 discussions with Ibn Sand, and Expressed ^ opinion that any view then expressed by h™ inc extempore could not reasonably be regarded as a ' 0 * c , ia j 1 d tbn gf* Hasa-Oatar boundary; he added that in any case he had inlormed um baud that His Maiesty's Government should be consulted before any concession was granted, 8 No decision has yet been reached regarding the status of the terntov; immediately to the east'of the 1913 convention line, but the despatch to Sn P l oraine mentioned in paragraph 6 above contained a warning as to the posi^on aTinlructed him .should it be found necessary to give the United States Embassy any oral explanations on Cll^ofOa tar Itself but Vo Jfer ton territory as specifically forming part of the State of Qatar itselt, Put to eter to u merely S llthTpril, Sir P.

This action was taken in order that the position might be made c ear to Standard Oil Company of California, who were carrying out aerial surveys whic His Maiesty’s Government feared might otherwise be extended over the frontiei Iflirl down in the convention of 1913. In addition, instructions were sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on the 21st April [E 2481/279/91/1934] to address a formal note to the Saudi Arabian Government, informing them of the request of the United States Embassy at Angora, and of the action taken. enclosing copies of the conventions of 1913 and 1914, and explaining the view of His Majesty. Government as to the validity of the frontiers laid down therein. This explana tion was to be on the lines laid down in the despatch to Sir P. Loraine summans in paragraph 6 of this memorandum, Sir A. Ryan’s attention also being called to the position as regards Qatar. Sir A. Ryan addressed a note accordingly to tie Saudi Arabian Government on the 28th April [E 2662/279/91/1934], In to note, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, he used the expression to convenience of reference ” in communicating copies of the conventions ot an 1914, in order to indicate the assumption that the Saudi Arabian Governmen already had knowledge of both. 10.

Subject:- Qatar Reconnaissance. 29th June 1934 . yjf. ^ ^ — fi\L I have the honour to refer to your telegram No:T/141 dated the 13th June 1934 and to say that I accompanied Flying Boat No:K.3678 (Flight-Lieutenant K.F.T.Pickles) on the Qatar Reconnaissance on the 29th June 1934. Statements regarding positions are made with reference to Admiralty Chart 2837/b. Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani had been informed of our coming and asked to warn his tribesmen. 2. We left the water at Manamah at 06.30 hours and proceeded southwards reaching the western shore of the Dohat Salwa just north of Dohat Hammar (07.15 hours) which was photo graphed . 3. We then proceeded to Salwa and searched for Sakak, which was (so far as can be told) found about seven miles south-east of the seashore opposite Salwa wells. The place can easily be found as it is close to the west of a curious flat topped hill, which is conspicuous in the air from Salwa and noticeable from sea level there. Sakak consists of two houses, apparently built of stone and mud, of fair size adjoining each other, if not actually connected. There are also scattered about some eight or nine /small — iiiiiiiWfi'T'''''i^wifr‘' —'Tiiigr” ■ - • t::(3). 2 . •\V rv .

There were at least three wells and the place was inhabited. I presume this place to be Sakak as it is more or less where Sakak was expected to be and there does not seem to be any other settlenent in the neighbourhood. Photographs were taken. Visibility was too poor (varying from four to seven miles) for it to be possible to see Ambak, but Flying-Officer K.R.Coates, who kindly checked and added to ny own observations, noticed two groups of about five wells about three miles south east of Sakak. 4. We then proceeded eastwards till we reached the sea after crossing the southern end of Khor al f 0daid. I attach a flimsy which will show our track approximately (though we maved to and fro at times to find clearer views). At the point T A t there was a small group of wells with xour bedouin tents and some twenty or thirty camels (many more, perhaps one hundred and fifty, were in the vicinity). We were at 2000 ? and did not descend below 1500 f when circling, but neitner the people nor the camels took much heed of our passing. 5. At no point in our journey between Sakak and Yas Island did we see any settlement, and it seems unlikely from the nature the country that there is any settlement; but visibility was too poor for it to be possible to make certain except over a stretch of say a couple of miles each side of our track. 6. At 09.45 hours we reached Yas Island where we found H.M.S Biaeford in accordance with the plan of reconnaissance; and Flying Officer Coates and I transferred to her. 7. I recommend that similar reconnaissances should be made at intervals as opportunity offers, with a view to gaining nore precise knowledge of the country and to encouraging our friends.8 . In conclusion, I should like to thank Flight-Lieutenant Pickles and the Officers and other ranks of the Flying Boat for the arrangeinen-fe which they unde both for the reconnaissance and for my comfort while on board. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent,Bahrain.Confidential* No:C/638-10/3. From: Political Agency, Bahrain, the 3rd July 1934. To:- Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A Political Agent, Bahrain. j/t&gt; (o The Honourable the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Qatar Oil and Boundaries. Sir, In continuation of ny letter No:C/637-10/3 dated the 3rd July 1934 regarding the Qatar reconnaissance on the 29th June 1934, I have the honour to reply to the specific questions - contained in your telegrams No:584 dated the 26th June and 3 O ^ No:589 dated the 27th June 1934 and also to submit certain further b V- information which I have gathered during ny talks with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi and the Residency Agent. 2 . No zakat (taxes) are paid to King Bin Sa f ud by the Trucial Chiefs, but presents of from five to ten canels are sent annually to Ibn Jiluwi 'by way of friendship' and the men who take them receive presents (partly at any rate cash) in return. The Residency Agent assures me that these presents do not imply any suzerainty. 3. King Bin Sa’ud does not keep an agent at Baraimi or at any other place east of the Blue Line, but sends Muzakis (tax- gatherers) yearly to collect taxes, sometimes as far afield as Baraimi. This is said to have been done for four years only, but I am not prepared to accept this statement as wholly correct. I should think that some amounts may well have been collected in earlier years, that the practice had extended gradually and that /tax2 tax collecting would vary in intensity and area according to other pre-occupations. 4 . King Bin Sa’ud^ influence on the Trucial Coast is very considerable, as the Trucial Chiefs are afraid of his pov/er and specifically fear that they may be absorbed by him. As an example of the practical effect of this influence if King Bin Sa f ud 'wants* a man in Dibai, he sends an emissary and the Shaikh does not hand over the wanted man, but turns him out of his territory, when he can easily be taken by King Bin Sa’ud^ emissary. 5. The tribal situation is broadly as follows. The p ani Yas are subject to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. He takas taxes on pearl boats and date plantations, but not on aniimls (doubtless because he has not the power to do so, though he says that it is not their custom). Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan states that the Bani Yas do not pay zakat to King Bin Sa ! ud, but it seems not unlikely that the outlying Bani Yas may pay if they happen to be at the time near places where zakat are being collected. The Manasir are under a number of petty Shaikhs. Rashid bin Mana f is said to be the leading Shaikh, but it is very doubtful if he has any real influence. The lAwamir have a more powerful head, Hamad bin Rakadh. Both the Manasir and T Awamir at present pay zakat to King Bin Sa f ud. It is stated that they have done so only for the last four or five years, but such a practice would be unlikely, in tines of peace, to come into being suddenly over so large an area, and has more probably grown up gradually over a longer period. The A1 Murrah, who also pay zakat to King Bin Sa ! ud /are3. are nearer to his territory and some even within his border, so that their position is somewhat different. 6 . It is important to note that the tribes only jpay zakat to a ruler who is in a position to extort them from them. This has by no means always been the ^in Sa f ud Family. For years zakat were paid to Sultan bin Saqr of Shar jah (the present Shaikh of Sharjah is his great-grandson) and after him to Zaid bin Khalifah of Abu Dhabi (grand-father of the present Shaikh of Abu Dhabi) till his death about 1918. The truth is that the? there has been no outstanding personality on the Trucial Coast for some years and King Bin Sa T ud has gradually filled the political vacuum. I think that the tribes may fairly be described at the present time as independent, but as buying off possible aggression both by paying zakat (one riyal for a camel, half for a young camel and a riyal for every five sheep) to and by obeying the orders of King Bin Sa f ud and of the Amir of Hasa (Ibn Jiluwi), which are probably kept within easy limits. Fdr example, none of the tribes of this area seem to have been taken to the Yemen, although Manasir and A1 Murrah from the Hasa side were taken. 7. I informed the Residency Agent that on his return to Sharjah he should arrange to send reliable men one to Baraimi, one to Dhafrah and one to the Sabakhah al Matti to obtain more exact information about the payment of zakat. I emphasised that the men mist be reliable and intelligent and promised that reasonable expenses would be paid. I said that I would write to him by air mil stating precisely what informtion was necessary and now enclose a copy of my letter No:C/642-10/3 dated the 3rd July 1934 to him.

In connection with Baraimi it is interesting to note that in 1904 (see page 771) the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi took Baraimi temporarily from the Bani Na'im,i.e. from the local tribes not from the Wahabis.' ******Note on aerial reconnaissances of the 9th May and the 29th June 1934 and information obtained from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Shaikh ’Abdullah bin 'Isa of Bahrain, the Residency Agent, Sharjah, and others. ******* t GENERAL . It is said that there are no settlements, other than Sakak and Ambak, in the area east of the Blue Line as far as Abu Dhabi. This is confirmed by the aerial reconnaissances (visibility 4 to 7 milob) along the line -akhnuniyah Island-Salwa-Sakak-Khor al 'Odaid-Sabakhah Matti-Yas Island. There are however desert wells here and there• 2 . SAKAK AND AMBAg. Sakak (7 miles south-east of the sea at Salwa near a conspicuous flat topped hill) consists of a couple of stone and mud houses, eight or nine reed huts and a garden of 50-70 palms with wells. There are two groups of about five wells situated three miles south-east of Sakak. AmbaK is saio. to be about the same size. Sakak is said to be inhabited in the summer (it was on the 29th June), but is vacated in the winter when the people take their animals away uo graze. The people are Al Horrah and pay zakat to Bin Sa*ud. 3. KHOR AL 'ODAID. The Khor al 'Odaid is a fine stretch of water forming a good Flying Boat anchorage and is connected with the sea by a channel passable for motor/• 2 - motor launches* 4# g^BAKHAH MATTI* The Sahakhah Matti is f as the term Sahakhan implies, a salty waste. It is said to he uninhabited hut a trail from ^man to Hasa, usable by motors, passes across it inland. On June 29th wells (no trees or cultivation) with a few bedouin tents were seen some 15 miles inland on the west edge of the Sabakhah. The coast is low and beset »*ith shoals and reefs* 5. DHAFMH * Dhafrah (an area in the hinterland south of Abu Dhabi not to be confused with ’Jafurah area south.west of ^atar) is almost entirely Manasir country and there are Very few persons from other tribes (except the ^wamir) there. The tract is fertile with a lot of trees andplenty of water. &lt; There are no built houses, but palm branch huts are used. Water is particularly plentiful at 'Uqail&amp;n, which is consequently used as a tribal gathering place by the iiuzakis (tax gatherers). The Manasir are under a number of petty Shaikhs. Rashid bin Mana* is said to be theleading Shaikh, but it is doubtful whether he has any real influence. The 1 Awamir, whose area is beyond Dhafrah up to Baraimi (Bani Na*^ and Bani Qitab), have a more powerful head, Hamad bin Rakadh. Both the Manasir and ‘Awamir at present pay zakat to Bin Sa‘ud, but only, it is stated, during the last 4 or 6 years. The/The Eanasir at any rate are said tn have paid zakat to Shaikh Zaid hin Khalifah of Ahu Dhabi (who died about 1918) and the history of Trucial ‘Oman tends to confirm this. So far as can be traced none of the tribes in this area have furnished men for tne /emen Campaign. Kach year lately a party (who may number some 30 armed men with some servants) of Muzakis (tax gatherers) has been sent to Dhafrah by the Amir ol hasa ( 1 Abdullah bin Jilouwi) about April. In 1933 the head i of the party was Badr al ‘Utaibi* but as there were complaints of his harshness to the people, Muhammad- al-Sahali was sent in 1934. Zakat is charged at the rate of one dollar for each full-grown camel, half a dollar tor each young camel, and one dollar for every five sheep. In 1934, 10,000 dollars are said to have been collected from the Manasir in Dhafrah. If a man cannot pay in cash, it is alleged that the Muzakis take one oi his best camels and assess its value at one—1iith ox what it should be (this is possibly exaggerated). The Muzakis sometimes go as far afield as Baraimi(where Bin Sa'ud has no agent) and 'Oman, where however they do not press for fixed rates but take what is given to them; in practice the payments vary, less if Bin Sa*ud is engaged in war or other pre-occupations, more if he is free to deal with the matter. Ho zakat is paid by the Trucial Chiefs to Bin Sa*ud, but courtesy presents of 5to 10 camels are sent yearly/yearly to the Amir of Hasa 'by way of friendship” and the bearers receive presents in return. These presents do not imply suzerainty. 7, The position seems to be that the Trucial Chiefs and the tribes fear aggression from Bin Sa f ud and to try to placate him, the former by presents of courtesy and oy listening to representations, for exaa^le, in cases affect ing his nationals, and the latter by paying zakat to him. But these arrangements are of recent standing and merely indicate that for the moment Bin Sa’ud is sulficiently powerful to make the payment of blackmail to him an appropriate insurance •r CONFIDENTIAL. 671-S of 1934. yvfv? 0) gH The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com pliments to 1.

D.O.No:C/670-10/5. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 14th July 1934. Confirming my telegram No:669 dated the 14th July 1934, I have just seen Mylles on his return from Qatar. He has been able to fix up an extension for eight months at Rs.2,500/- a month. He has promised to send a report after his return to Abadan, but for your information I am sending you a precis of his conversation. 2 . At the beginning the Shaikh appeared to expect that Mylles was coming to settle up about a concession and not to get an extension of the option. 3. The Shaikh refused to see Mylles alone and Salih bin Mana T , Yusuf Kanoo, Hajji Williamson and Shaikh Hamad were present at the first interview. It was apparent that the Shaikh was not concerned with the clauses of any concession but was only concerned with the amount of money he would get. His final terms for a concession, which he maintained throughout, were, one and a half lakhs of rupees a year for four years and afterwards five lakhs a year and royalty at 4 shillings, 2 shillings and 2 pence a He was under the impression that a shilling and/rupee were the same. He said that Chisholm had offered these terms but that they had been eventually refused by the Directors of the Company. Mylles pointed out that Chisholm had agreed to no such terms and later on Salih bin Mana f admitted this, but said that the Shaikh was under the impression that these terms had been given by Chisholm. 4. It appears that there Is much ill-feeling between Salih bin Mana ! and Yusuf Kanoo and Hajji W r illiamson, and2 . at the beginning Salih appeared to do his best to make things difficult for Mylles. 5. Mylles asked for an extension and the Shaikh after a private discussion with Salih and Shaikh Hamad became very angry and said that if at the end of the extension the Company did not come to an agreement then other companies interested would think that there was not oil in Qatar. 6 . Mylles managed to have several private talks with Salih. He thinks that Salih is quite untrustworthy but that he would attempt to help the Company as long as it was worth his while. He had copies of the Bahrain, Persian, two T Iraq and Hasa concessions and also knew the exact details of the Kuwait concession. After his talk with him, Mylles was able to get the Shaikh to agree to the terms noted above. 7. Mylles is of the opinion that the Shaikh will eventually agree to terms similar to those of the Kuwait concession but will not under any circumstances be prepared to accept less. It also appears that the Shaikh does not appreciate the fact that he may be refused permission to give a concession to any other company. 8 . When Yusuf Kanoo visited Qatar in May he attempted to start negotiations without any authority from the Company. This annoyed the Shaikh and it seems that Yusuf Kanoo has not got the influence there that he would have us believe. The Shaikh impressed on Mylles that he would rather conduct discussions with a senior official of the Company. honourable kieut-Colonel Gordon Loch,I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

I HAVE the honour to inform you, as a matter of possible interest, that the United States Embassy in Angora recently enquired whether a copy of the Anglo- Turkish Treaty of the 29th July, 1913, which delimited the frontiers between Aden and the Ottoman dominions and between Muscat and the Ottoman dominions, among others, could be supplied to them from the archives of His Majesty’s Embassy. The United States Embassy have been informed that a search was made among the archives of this Embassy, but without result. 2. In making this request the secretary of the United States Embassy explained that it was the State Department at Washington which desired a copy of the treaty, and had instructed the Embassy here to apply for a copy to the Turkish Government. The secretary went on to say that he had himself'thought of addressing a similar request to His Majesty’s Embassy in order to avoid delay in obtaining a copy of the treaty. 3.

[E 1839/1206/91] Si/* John Simon to Sir P. Loraine (A ngora) (No. 125.) Sir, 125.) Foreign Office, March 22, 1934. IN your despatch No. 72 of the 13th February, your Excellency reported an enquiry made by the United States Embassy at Angora regarding the Anglo- Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913. This enquiry may prove of considerable importance, since there is reason to believe that the interest which it reveals on the part of the L nited States Government in the question of boundaries in Eastern Arabia is in all probability connected with the activities of United States oil interests in that area. As you are no doubt aware, in July 1933 the Standard Oil Company of California obtained from King Ibn Saud an oil concession covering the eastern part of his dominions. To the north the limits of this concession are co-terminous with the frontiers between Saudi Arabia, on the one hand, and Iraq and the independent Arab principality of Koweit, on the other. These frontiers are now laid down in certain agreements referred to in paragraph 3 below, but the position in the south and south-east is, however, less simple. 2. On the 29th July, 1913, His Majesty’s Government concluded with the Ottoman Government a convention defining the south-eastern boundary of Turkish Arabia from the coast of the Persian Gulf as far as the twentieth parallel of latitude. A second convention concluded on the 9th March, 1914, continued the definition of this boundary between this point and the already delimited frontier between the Vilayet of the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate. Copies of the 1913 convention are enclosed in this despatch; the text of the 1914 convention will be found on pp. 42 and 43 of the 1933 edition of Volume XI of Aitchison’s Treaties, Engagements and Sanads, a copy of which is, I understand, in the library of His Majesty’s Embassy. The first of these conventions was never ratified, but the boundary line laid down in article 11 thereof was definitely adopted by article 3 of the second convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on the 3rd June, 1914. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have not had occasion to discuss with King Ibn Saud, since he acquired independent sovereignty over Nejd and the Hasa coast, the question of the precise boundary between his dominions and those of the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, although Ibn Saud has, by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of the 20th May, 1927, formally recognised those special relations and undertaken to maintain friendly relations with the rulers concerned. But the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of the 1913-14 line have now become independent States cannot be regarded, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, as in any way affecting the status of the territories on the other side of that line, which were then, and still remain, under British influence. His Majesty’s Government, therefore, still regard the 1913-14 line as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Succession State of Saudi Arabia and the territories of South-Eastern Arabia, with which they are in special relations. 3. Having regard to the presence of United States oil interests in this area, it is important that the United States Government should be under no misapprehension on this point. It is desirable, therefore, that they should receive as full an account as possible of the position of His Majesty’s Government in this matter without delay, and should not be left to obtain possibly misleading information from the Turkish or Saudi Arabian Governments. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will arrange, as soon as possible, for the United States Embassy at Angora (a) to be furnished with a copy of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, and (b) to be shown the text of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914 (Aitchison, Volume XI (1933), p. 42 onwards). It should be pointed out to the United States Embassy that, while the 1913 convention [56 y—1], i_ TT1 in article 11 is mentioned, adequate!? is unratifted, the boundary laid “9^ n f the ratified convention of IQU.-whicl defined and definitely adopted m r ^„ent remains operative.

Section 4. [E 2481/279/91] No. 1. Mr. Rendel to Mr. Millard {United States Embassy). Dear Millard, Foreign Office, April 24, 1934. SINCE we arranged, as a result of your call upon me on the 3rd March, that the aircraft, which the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company are going to use for survey work over the area of their concession in Eastern Saudi Arabia, should in certain emergencies be allowed to fly from the Hasa coast to Bahrein, we have heard from our Embassy at Angora that your Embassy there have recently made informal enquiries regarding the treaty instruments governing the frontiers, &amp;c., in that part of the world. We have instructed our Embassy to put yours on the track of the relevant agreements. 2. It has occurred to us that the enquiry of your Embassy at iVngora may well have been made in connexion with the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company’s concession and proposed aircraft survey. Whether that be so or not, it has suggested to us that, since we have been in correspondence on the subject of the company’s aircraft, and you may not have had the opportunity of obtaining full information as to the boundary between Saudi Arabia and the area under British influence to the south-east of it, you may like to have the enclosed copies of two Anglo-Turkish conventions, of the 29th July, 1913, and the 9th March, 1914, respectively, which, inter alia, cover the matter. 3. The 1913 convention was never ratified, but you will see that the boundary line laid down in article 11 of it was redefined and formally adopted in article 3 of the 1914 convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on the 3rd June of that year. 4. The frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British spheres of influence in South-Eastern Arabia is thus a line running from the head of the bay immediately to the south of Zaknuniya Island, a little to the east of Uqair, in a due southerly direction to a point on parallel 20° north in the middle of the Ruba-al-Khali desert, and thence running south-westwards, at an angle of 45 degrees, down to the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and what is now the territory of the Imam of the Yemen. King Ibn Saud has, of course, succeeded to Turkish sovereignty on the west and north-west of that line, Saudi Arabia being one of the Turkish succession States. 5. The prohibition in regard to flights of aircraft, to which we have already made reference in the official correspondence about the company’s request for facilities for their aeroplane at Bahrein, applies, of course, to the area to the east and south-east of the above line; and, if you think there is any likelihood of the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company’s survey of their concession (as to the precise area of which I understand no information has yet been published) extending to the vicinity of the boundary referred to above, we should be grateful if you would make sure that they are informed of the position, in order that there may be no danger of their aircraft unwittingly violating the prohibition of flying to the east of the boundary, or of their inadvertently extending their operations in any way to the east of that line.

My dear Walton x r After we had agreed on the telephone that it wouldbe best for me to speak to Millard of the United States Embassy about the violation of the 'blue line' by the aeroplane of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, as reported in the Politioal Residents telegram No. T.l4 / 8 of the 15th June, referred to in your letter No«P.Z .40E2/vj4^ofthe 21st June, Millard asked to see me on some other matters, hlb He oame to see me on the 29th June and after we had disposed of his points, I told him of the information contained in JPowle 1 s telegram referred to above. Millard was visibly disturbed and at once began to explain to me that he had, on \ receiving Rendel’s letter on S.2481, communicated its contents by bag to Mr. Murray ofthj State Department for communication to the headquartei*s of the Standard Oil Company oi California* Millard went on to speculate as to whether instructions on the subject could possibly not have reached the Company 1 s local officials in the Hasa before the violation reported in E 4006 had taken placei as the Resident had not reported the date on which the violation took place, it was impossible to be certain but it seemed unlikely that there had not been time ror the instructions to be received locally* Millard also said that having regard to the position of Salwa with reference to the coast line, he could not conceive how the pilot oi the aeroplane could have been mistaken as to Salwa being to the east Ox the blue line as described by us. alt on. Esq. ,CB..MC. Millard/11 Millard then asked me what we wanted done in the matter. I told him that relations between His Majesty's Government and the Bahrein Oil Company (which, like the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which operates in the Hasa, is a subsidiary of the Standard of California) had always been most amicable and we were anxious that relations in that part of the world with Standard of California and its subsidiaries should remain so. On the other hand, we naturally expected that the frontier would not be violated, and wanted the position cleared up. I left it to him what action to take; we did not want to make an unnecessary fuss so long as the position was made clear. Millard expressed gratitude for out* attitude in the matter, said that he was still extremely puzzled by what had occurred, that he would pass on the inf ormation as regards the violation of the frontier to Mr. Murray of the State Department in order that the question could be taken up with Standard of California. This seems to me satisfactory. I have not the least doubt from Millard's attitude that he, at any rate, is not privy to any intention on the part of the Standard Oil Company of California, or the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to jump our claims as regards the blue line.

Yours sincerely, (8d.) J. C. WALTON,. 4596/34. Dear Walton, QATAR. You are, I think, familiar with the steps we have recently taken to send Mr. My lies to Qatar with the object of renewing the option period for 6 months, or possibly more. It will not be possible, for various reasons, to open up concession negotiations with the Shaikh for several months, but my recollection is that we are generally agreed with the India Office, etc. respecting the character of the two Agreements (Government and Company) which will govern the negotiations. However, I suggest it will be desirable that we should have one meeting at the India Office, after the leave season, when we can be quite •sure that we are keeping step. There is one point arising out of our last meeting on which I think it desirable to write you: I am referring to the clause respecting 1 refining 1 in the Government Agreement. You may remember that at the discussion in the India Office, at which Mr. Agnew was present, he expressed dislike for the wording of the Refining Clause as it appears in the Kuwait Political Agreement and suggested another method of meeting the situation. However, at a discussion I recently had with him, in which he learnt that the Kuwait Political Agreement would not be published to the world, or referred to in the Commercial Agreement, he agreed that, I subject to the same procedure being followed in the case of 1 Qatar/ ' fait on, Esq., C.B., M.C. , Ddia Office, ■Whitehall, S.W.l.Qatar, he would no longer object to accepting the precise wording of the Kuwait Clause 10. Alternatively, and arising out of the views he expressed at the meeting at the India Office, he has prepared a new draft clause which he would he equally willing to accept. I enclose herewith a copy of the alternative draft Speaking for my own side, I am prepared to accept either the original Kuwait draft or that proposed by Mr. Agnew, although, personally, I would prefer, for the sake of uniformity, to stand by the drafting as it appears in the Kuwait Agreement. However, we leave it to you to choose the one which is preferred from your point of view. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) A.C. Hearn. P.S.

This, of course, greatly relieves the tension. L HaAlng re Sard to our experience in guv/ait, vre feel that it would be very desirable for all 'political' | matters to be settled between the Government's political representatives and the Shaikh before our negotiator j appears on the scene. if you concur in this view, we can, no doubt, arrive at a mutually satisfactory time-table lor the future* As I remarked in my previous letter, x suggest it would be desirable to have another meeting at the India Office in order to settle all outstanding points.

Dear Hearn, I write with further reference to your letter of 18th July to Walton, who is on leave, about Qatar Oil to say that we understand from Fowle that he has now discussed with you in detail the question of procedure, and that in the light of his views you are now prepared to adopt the same procedure in Qatar as in the case of Koweit, viz: to enter into a political agreement with His Majesty’s Government on the same general lines as in Koweit, and thereafter to proceed with commercial negotiations with the Sheikh. The political agreement would in due course be disclosed to the Sheikh, but not necessarily in the early stage of the commercial negotiations. We feel strongly ourselves that this is the right course to adopt, and we are glad to understand that the Company now ieel the same. 2. We suggest that the meeting on outstanding points in the political agreement might take place once we have the views of the Admiralty about refining. I hope that these will not now be long delayed.

Being a ihslem, and, unlike most 'converts”, being trusted by his fellow Mohammedans, he is in a position to gauge local Moslem opinion fairly correctly. I was careful to avoid expressing my own opinion and let him talk, which he was quite willing to do. 2. On the subject of Kuwaiti Oil he was definitely of opinion that Major Holmes ’was the nigger in the wood pile, and for his own ends had assisted the Sheikh to stick out for high terms from the K.O*C. He said that the Sheikh would never have adopted such a stiff attitude towards the Company unless he had been instigated thereto by Major Holmes. 3. Qatar Oil . He, Haji Williamson, had gone to Qatar with Mr. Mylles of the A.P*O.C. on his recent visit to the Sheikh, and on the whole was rather favourably impressed with the sheikh's attitude, which had improved since the last visit of the A.P.O.C, representatives last year. He thought that the policy of leaving the sheikh alone, end so giving the impression that the Company were not running after him to get the concession, had been successful. He was under the impression that there were some hopes, though, of course, he could not commit himself in any way definitely, that at the end of the new option period/perioa the Sheikh might oe willing to abate his terms. He said that he had. heara indirectly that ton aaud s ouock had somewhat gone down with the Sheikn, as a consequence of the evacuation of Hoaeida and the Yemen Littoral without apparently payment of any subsidy on the part of the Imam. The sheikh of Kuwait, in the course of casual conversation with me a day or two later, also expressed the opinion that the final result of the Saudi-Yemeni war was not regarded by the Arabs of the Gulf as by any means too successful from Ibn Saud's point of view.

Your Excellency is not aware of the great difference between the position at the time of the signature of the two conventions mentioned above and the position which came after and of the great developments which have taken place in Arabia itself and which led to the alteration of the frontier line laid down in the conven tion of the 29th July, 1913, between the dominions of His Majesty the King and Koweit. There is no doubt that the same developments (besides the considerations of which I had an opportunity of mentioning some to your Excellency during our ii lendly conversation of Wednesday last, the 3rd May) put the Government of His Majesty the King in a position of being compelled to state their inability to consider the frontier line specified in the two above conventions as actually constituting the correct line of their frontier with the neighbouring territories in the east and south of Arabia. With this reservation, therefore, they declare their readiness to (enter into) discussion at any time desired with a view to defining the frontiers in a manner which shall be in consonance with the actual conditions and which shall secure for this country and for all the neighbouring Arab territories the essential interests of each in a practical way.

He came back here two days ago, 5 th September 1934, for the same purpose. 2. In all cases where Qataris have passes these come to the Agency but in the pearling season traders come over in small boats without passes to Bahrain. It might be advisable to draw the addention of the Shaikh of Qatar to this, though it is unlikely that he will be able to enforce all Qataris to take out passes. It would obviously be impossible for us to check entries at the Customs .jetty. Information is generally received of any arrivals of known people and their movements can be checked when necessary. 3. In view of the state of the negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Gxi Company Limited and the Shaikh of Qatar a policy of not exerting too much pressure on the Snaikh at present might be worth consideration.

He was rather tired and felt some pain in his leg. He has been treated by Dr.L.P.Dame of the Arabian Mission here. 2 . He had no other meeting with any member of The Bahrain Petroleum Company Idmited and I think from his talk vvith me that he would have refused any business talk unless he had consulted the Political Agent. I have no information to any activities of Salih al ^ni 1 in that direction though he is friendly with several people attached to The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. E. I called on Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Qasim ai Thani to WiS h goodbye on the 19th October. Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah al Thani and Salih al ^ani f w r ere present. After coffee Shaikh ! Abdullah said that he hoped I would not be emended but he felt that his subjects were not treated in the same way as subjects of Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast. I /saidsaid that I would rather speak to him alone and he then ordered Shaikh Hamad and Salih al Mani&lt; to the other end of the boat. 4. When we were alone he said that the insistence on passes from Qatar subjects made him feel that his dignity had been lowered in the eyes of other Shaikhs. A s Shaikh of Qatar he had his position to keep up. H e asked me why this had been done. 5. I saw that hedging would be easily understood as unwillingness to discuss the question so I considered it better to approach the matter from another angle. I then gradually led the conversation round to the uresent oil negotiations. G. He said that he would be perfectly willing to give ajconcession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, provided he was given terms not inferior to those at Kuwait oiid Bahrain. He said that Mr. Chisholm had promised him nore but that this promise had not been kept. He felt that Mr. Mylles would never do that and that was why he was more hopeful. I v/arned him that he must not try the Company too far by insisting on impracticable terms. Generally I explained the difficulties of new oil finding a market - he knew the position in Bahrain - and the possibility of the oil found not being satisfactory. He appreciated this and wanted to know what would be Government’s position is no agreement were reached. I was careful to point out that Government had no connection w-ith any oil Company. We would naturally like to see the negotiations brought to a successful conclusion but that was because we were certain that his benefit would be ours also. He said that people thought that Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil C onl p an y Limited were very much the same in this connection. I think I /managedmanaged to put this idea out of his mind. I told him that under the Treaty he was not in a position to negotiate with any foreign company and, moreover. Government would not permit him to do so. Also I said that it was not proper for him to entertain advances through third parties without informing Government about them and taking Government's advice He said that he had not done so but had to admit that advances had been made from the Americans though never to him person- ally - he gave me his word about this. 7. He then asked if the negotiations with the Anglo- Persian On Company fell through whether it would be wise for him to do nothing more about oil - he was a Bedouin and able to live on very little unlike the Shaikh of Bahrain - or whether he should write and ask Government if he could try to get another O 0 mpany to take the concession. I said that it would be a great pity if he did not reach an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil G om p an y anc j admitted that he was well aware of the difference between the Americans and the English I and he would prefer to have the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to any foreign Company. I then said that I thought it unlikely that Government would agree to any other Company exploiting Qatar oil but that Government would appreciate his frankness if he were to write and ask their opinion should the present negotiations fail. 8* I was very glad to find him so frank. He evidently disliked the pin pricks of air reconnaissances and the insistence on passes and felt not only that his dignity had bee n lowered but thought that Government was trying to help the Anglo-Persian Company to get cheap terms. He seemed willing to come to an agreement on the lines of the Kuwait a Sreement though he pointed out that there were certain questions still in dispute there. On the whole he appeared to hc.ve no desire for an American Company. I am sure he was s POaking the truth when he said that he had no personal /dealings4. ,xq dealings with the Americans since Major ^olmes made an offer to him. But it was equally obvious that he had been \ approached through those near him such as Salih al Mani f . He was particularly friendly and begged me to go to see him and let him take me to an underground cave visited by Captain Prior and give me some hawking. 9. Our insistence on Qatar passes may revive his suspicions that Government is behind the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and is not acting openly with him. It will certainly continue to make him feel that we are lowering his dignity in the eyes of his subjects and of other Shaikhs: and it may tend to make him more obstinate. Vftien I left I asked him particularly to keep his Treaty in mind. Government would not permit him to enter into any sort of negotiations with foreign companies and it would be very much in his interests if he prevented any intermediary from having dealings with foreign companies. He took an oath that he had done and would do no such thing.

Having carefully considered the contents of your note and the reports which I had already addressed to them regarding my conversation with your Excellency on the 2nd May, my Government have instructed me to inform the Saudi Govern ment of their inability to admit that events since the conclusion of the Anglo- Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 have modified the legal position defined in my note of the 28th April. They cannot but regard that position as binding on the Saudi Government and as being only susceptible of alteration by agreement between that Government and themselves. So far as the boundaries now in question are concerned, they do not consider that any developments in Arabia since 1914 have been such as to render inappropriate to present circum stances the blue line laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 and duly confirmed by the convention of 1914.

Gass, and Mr, Lefroy of the Anrlo- Psrsian Oil Company called at the India Office on 10th October to discuss the question of the q,atr oil concession. Mr. Walton, ;ar. Laithwaite, Mr. Crombie and Colonel ?ovile ^jere present at the meeting. 2 — laser said that, except x'or the question of the Refining Clause, the terms of the Political Agreement had novj been agreed between the Company and His Majesty* s Government. With regard to refining, he had been in correspondence with the Admiralty and hoped that a settlement was now in sight and that this would be on the lines of the Refining Clause in the Koweit Political Agreement. The Admiralty were disappointed that he ?;as unable to go farther than this, cut it was impossible to get the foreign constituents of the I.P.C. to agree to anything more. He explained that the Shell Company had ' one Dutch and one British Director while similarly the American interests in the I.P.C. had one American and one British Director. 3 Turning to the commercial negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatr, Mr. Fraser said that thesevnuld continue to be carried on by Mr. Mylles in whom he had every confidence and who would have a power of A 11 orney xiom the Company to conclude an agreement with the Sheikh. i The question to be decided Ws,s the most suitable time for introducing the Political Agreement into the, negotiations. Should a representative of H.M.^. approach the Sheikh and clear this question up now or would it be better for the Commercial Agreement to be settled firstr Mr. Walton, Mr. Lai thwaite and Colonel Fowle all agreed that it would be best that the Commercial Agreement should/— —3 *oiM be settled first and Colonel F ov,le sug8B8ted that tiU “ AB ™ emat Sh0uld te signed subject to the approval 01 n.M.O. though ho was apprehensive that this might have an unfavourable reaction on the Sheikh. m reply to an enquiry from Mr n . u um I»u. eraser, he explained that, as in the case of Koweit, the Sheikh of Qatr vras precluded by his treaty obligations with H.M.G. from giving a concession without their approval. Mr. Walton recallec that in the Koweit concession there had at first been a clause iiruling uhe Commercial and the Political Agreements, but that this had finally been taken out oi the Commercial Agreement and put in an Exchange of iCfc.otes. Colonel Fowle suggested that the Sheikh of Qabr might say that he was prepared to sign the Coi.jnei cial Agieement but that before actually signing he v.culd like uo see the terms of the Political Agreement or, alternatively, 'that he might sign the Commercial Agreement and leave it to the Company’s negotiator to explain that the Agreement must be subject to the approval of H.M.G. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that it would be best, if possible, to get the Sheikh to sign subject to the approval of H.M.G. without mentioning the Political Agreement. It v/as finally agreed that the most suitable procedure would be that, simultaneously with the signature of the Commercial Agreement, there should be an exchange of letters between the Sheikh aid the Company to the effect that the Agreement had been signed 'subject to the Sheikh’s treaty obligations to H.M.G. ! ’ There would thus be no necessity for any reference to 'che Political Agreement in the concession and the oheixJi need not know that the terms of the Political Agreement— - 3 - had m zact been agreed in advance between H.M.G. and the Company. H.M.G. would then produce the Political Agreement for the parties to sign and, subject to this, would give their consent to the concession, the Sheikh simultaneously sending a letter to the Political Agent agreeing that the Commercial Agreement would be subject to the 't-ims of the Political Agreement. The negotiations would thus be concluded by four sets of documents: (a) the Commercial Agreement; / ^ o'. r? :&gt; \ (b) an exchange of letters between the Company and the chelkh ; p' the Political Agreement; and ( d) an exchange ox letters between the Sheikh --xi H.ivi.b, ^ / *2_ S W * 5 It was agreed that Mr. Lexroy should send a letter to the India Office to put it on record that the Company understood and accepted the above programme for the negotiations and enclose for the approval of H.M.G. a dralt of the letter which the Company would send to the Sheikh under (b) . £ At the end of the meeting Mr. Lefroy remarked that it had been clear during the Company's previous negotiations with the Sheikh that the latter was / maintaining veiy close contact with the Standard Oil Company in Has a and that he v^as also au f ai t with the situation in regard to the Koweit Oil negotiations. He expressed the opinion that if the Kuwait Oil Company obtained their concession at Koweit, the position at Qatr might be much more favourable to the Company.By Air Mail.

Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.l. Dear Laithwaite, 1 st November, 1934. Thank you for your letter of the (P.Z . 6327/34)', about Qatar oil. 18th October, On that letter and our conversation on the 20 th October I have had a redraft made of the last draft dated 13th March, and enclose six copies, dated 25th October 1934, of the redraft of the concession. I have marked on one of these copies the passages or wording different from the last draft dated 13th March 1934, which are as follows: Preamble . Mylles 1 name is substituted for Chisholm 1 s. Article 6 . In accordance with the suggestion in paragraph (l) of your letter, the following words have been added at the end of the 3 rd paragraph: and in times of national emergency the Shaikh shall have full use, free of charge, of the Company’s wireless and telegraph installations and railways for governmental purposes”. Article 10 . In the hope of obviating difficulties actually experienced elsewhere, v/e have reworded the last sentence of the first paragraph. In Persia it has even been claimed that such articles as medical supplies and geological expeditionary equipment, for example, are imported for or applicable to the personal use of employees, and are, therefore, dutiable. As you will see, we propose to restrict the dutiable category to articles sold to employees for their personal use - with the exception of food supplies, all imports of which will be liable to duty. Considering the desert nature of the country we still feel this to be a^harsh requirement of and we feel it unreasonable to place in the hands of a Shaikh notorious for his cupidity 'the power to make the ordinary amenities of life for Europeans unattainable by reason of excessive duties which2 . i affect strangers only. We hope that you will reconsider this point and remove your insistence on its offer to the Shaikh. » T he third paragraph of the draft of 13th March has heen_ deleted in agreement with you* it is to he covered as in Kuwait hy an exchange of letters, lor purposes ox construction the article has been divided into two clauses of which (b) covers the pnint in paragraph ( 2 ) of your letter of the 18th October. It was felt here that this division of the article into two clauses gave undue stress to the 'words 'at any time' in the opening phrase of the article. To avoid misinterpretation, and since the occasions on v/hich the Shaikh can terminate the agreement are clearly defined, we have deleted those three words. Article 16. . In consequence of the new reference to default in Article 14 (b) it became necessary to insert a default clause in the arbitration provisions. A paragraph on the lines of the Kuwait draft has been added at the end of the article. A rticle 21 of the draft of I3th March . This has been omitted from the present draft, and is to be covered by an exchange of letters. With reference to the suggestion in paragraph (3) of your letter under reply, we 'would pray you excuse us from adding 'in accordance with your Excellency's Treaty obligations' to the letter which is to be handed to the Shaikh when the Concession is signed. We feel that it is not for us to remind in writing such a Potentate of treaty obligations towards another State, and you promised to reconsider this point. As I told you, Mylles will be instructed to remind verbally the Shaikh of the common knowl&amp;dge as to his treaty obligations regarding concessions in handing him the letter. We are sending copies of this draft of 25th October to Abadan shortly, with the reservation that our instructions as to negotiations may still be subject to understandings with His Majesty's Government at this end, though you will doubtless have learned that the Kuwait reiinery provisions are now acceptable to the Admiralty for The negotiations are not going to be easy, I fear Yours sincerely, L.

In the presence of:-Ref: GM/1578. ABADAN. PERSIAN GULF. 8 th November, 1934. My dear Fowle, LA T A R. You will, I think, be interested to learn our oresent posi tion with regard to negotiations in ^atar. The Sheikh has made it plain that he does not want to com mence negotiations until after Ramadhan, and to confirm his inten tions he has left -for a tour of his territory and also announced that he will spend the fast at an inconvenient soot in the desert. Cur view is that he is waiting to get a line from Kuwait before he commences business with us. We have already made the house in Do hah habitable, and a geological survey party will have commenced one rations. I am now sending Ifylles for a short visit to Qatar. He will see the survey oarty, establish relations with the leading inhabitants and if possible pay courtesy visits on the Sheikh. My lies should leave here about the end of next week, most probably by tug, and it occurred to me that you might like to see him. If so will you kindly telegraoh and I will arrange for the tug to call at Bushire en route. I need hardly say that we should be very grateful for any advice and assistance you are able to give Mylles. We were so sorry not to have been able to accent your kind invitation to lunch in London, but unfortunately we were leaving England on that day. I made desperate efforts to tele phone you but the office had given me the wrong number and I h failed to make contact. Many thanks all the same and I hone you ^ were not inconvenienced.

Will you let me know your views about this? I may point out, as regards the rates of duty, that Articles of the Sheikh’s Treaty of 1916 provides that 'the customs dues on goods of British merchants imported into Qatar shall not exceed those levied on my own subjects on such goods and shall not in any case exceed 5^ ah valorem .

It is, however, xi orn a oaitc ciia^-erenc Standpoint also relevant in this connection that there can be little question that the Sheikh will be familiar with the provisions of the K owe it Agreement , and that any marked difference between its terms and t nose 03 . tne concession which he is asked to accept may give rise to difficulty. 3. We agree to the redraft of Article 14 and the omission of the words M at any time'. 4* As regards the penultimate paragraph of your letter, in the light of what you say we will not press our suggestion that the words 'in accordance with Your Excellency's Treaty obligations' should be inserted in the letter referred to in paragraph 2 of your letter to me of 10th October. 5.

Dear Laithwaite , Thank you for your letter of the 15th November regarding Qatar oil, under reference P.2.6792/34. The information you give as to the limitation to 5^ ad valorem of the duties which this Shaikh at least may levy on foodstuffs which we might import entirely alters the picture. It is not 5 c /o duties that we are frightened of on food, but the 255^ or more which we have experienced elsewhere. I see little protection from our point of view in any provision that customs dues shall not exceed those levied on Qatar subjects, because our experience elsewhere again has been that our food and other private requirements are not those required by the inhabitants of the countries in which wo work, and it is therefore very simple to introauce taxation involving no discrimination in principle but an unbearable burden in practice. If the Shaikh’s Treaty of 1916 is to bind him and his successors during the currency of a possible concession, we should not ask for reconsideration of duties on foodstuffs. I hope that you will not make water similarly dutiable, as I have just hoard from Qatar that virtually all the springs there are ”straight Epsom salts’”. I agree with your view as to the likelihood of the Shaikh being familiar with the provisions of the Kuwait Agreement. We have ^very reason to believe that he is closely informed of every step there, and that he has no intention of any serious negotiations pending the completion of the Kuwait negotiations. yi I am glad that such variations as wore effected in the draft dated 25th October are acceptable to you. I enclose another six copies of the draft. Our geological party should by now I think be in Qatar, and Iviylles v/ill be going there this month to have a look at them e.nd at the Shaikh, but does not anticipate as I said any serious discussions, since during Ramadan the Shaikh proposes to retire to an inaccessible part of the desert and will e prepared to hold discussions only during the night season.

I note what you write about the Treaty limitations on the Shaikh’s power to levy excessive import duties. As regards Article 10» there seems to be a certain misunderstanding between us. rv I read in your letter of the IbtlpRTovembeivthe words ’’existing draft” to refer to&gt;he draft of the 25th Octooer. The draft of the 25th October-as I read it appears to give you all the satisfaction you want in requiring a liability on the Company to pay import duties both onlbod supplies and on merchandise, etc* imported by it for sale to its employees. As I pointed letter of the 1st November, we reworded the draft of the y 13th March - but without altering in any way its sense - in order to avoid future claims that the Company was liable to duty on goods or materials- 5 imported purely -tor Company purposes,for example geological expeditionary equipment, which is issued to geologists from store and taken back into store on their return, against which we have elsewhere experienced claims that such material was dutiable. In our view the goods on which the Company snoula be exempt are those which are imported as the property of the Company/mm Company and remain the property of the Company; goods on which the Company is dutiable are foodstuffs and goods imported by the Company directly for its employees, and in which the Company does not retain property but hands over the goods to the employees against payment. In Persia until the duties became perfectly prohibitive large quantities of goods were so imported for our employees and the normal duties paid. The distinction we make is very definitely as to whether goods are M on charge' 1 against an employee or the personal property of an employee# L(tyb LM/n As you have not told me in what respect the wording of Article 10-In the draft of 25th October, as explained in my letter of the 1st November, is objectionable, I hope that this explanation will clear up the question. I cannot read into our redrafted Article 10 any attempt at avoiding any of the duties for which you are suggesting that the Company should be liable. Yours, &amp;c., (3gd.)L. LSFROY.By Air Mail.

It is impossible to say what alteration in our Treaty relations with Qatar may not take place over a period so long as that of your Concession, but you may I think, feel fairly confident that in the event of the existing Treaty being replaced or mo a if ie d His IVA j e sty 1 s Government will be anxious here, as they have b^en elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, to require tne sheikh’s concurrence/ Lefroy, Esq., . , Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, S.C. 2.a - l1 u concurrence in tne fixing of a maximum rate of duty 50 far as British goods are concernea.

As regards paragraph 5 of your letter, you will remember that I maae it clear in my letter of 15th November referred to above that, failing an exemption payment, we must hold to the existing draft of Article 10, i.e. that of 13th torch 1934. This will, of course, involve the alteration of tne last sentence 111 a 0 f sub- paragraph 1 of that article, as shown in the . ^ draft enclosed in your letter to me of 17th November, to read 'but the Company shall pay on all personal goods, clothing ana general merchandise imported by it for the personal use of its employees and on food supplies the ordinary duty in force in the State of Qatar'. 4, we shall be glad to have any information you can give us as to the sheikh's reactions on My lies' arrival and as to the progress of any discussions that toy take place.

Saleh al Mana* He is at present out of favour and heavily in debt. The Shaikh has taken a mortgage on his house in Dohah and his wife has been removed by her relatives.

He is in poor health having suffered a lot fever; he appears ilso to have had a slight stroke.

Holmes • The Yatims are believed to be supporta-ii^ Saleh al Mana* financially. They are reported to have asked for a concession from Shaikh Hamid to drill 6 artesian wells for Rs.7000 plus a cash present to Hamid; the same report has it that Hamid r el used owing to the n .P .Q»C* option, but stated he would be willing to do business when it expired. It appears that Holmes through his intermediaries is trying to get a footing in ^atur affairs, so that he can operate when our option expires. He may be working on his own behalf or in the hope that if he gets established the S.O.C. will recognise him as their negotiator. 8 . Bassenger Traffic ~ Dohah/Khuwair/ BahL-aiii. A partnership of Bahrain merchants 60% and Dohah merchants 20% has been formed to operate a taxi/ launch service between Dohah and Bahrain; they have asked the Shaikh for a 15 years' monopoly- in consideration of a 20% share, the money o—.. 0 found by the Dohah group. The Shaikh has replies that /-3- that for Rs.2000 to himself and Rs.1000 to Hamid, he will consider the matter favourably after the *Id. THe money has been paid by the Dohah group. The traffic to-day is negligible and the merchants are relying on oil operations in the near future for the necessary traffic. The merchants consider that if the A.r.O.C. does not obtain the concession, the H.O.C. will. 9. watar/IIahd Boundary * It is reported that when Shaikh Kasir visited ^atar in October he brought a communication from Najd suggesting a demarcation of the boundary, ihe Shaikh is reported to have replied that the boundary had never been in doubt either in his life-time or that of his father and he saw no reason to raise the question now. It is presumed that the H.O.C. are supporting if not instigating the proposal for adjusting the boundary with a view to getting part of the suspected structure into Hasa territory. sd.

Dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter of the 1st December about the Q,atar Oil concession, under reference P.Z. 7312/34. Letters we have recently exchanged clear up I think what misunderstanding may have existed between us. I now see your point that in principle the altered wording in Article 10 of our draft of the 25th October is 'much more restrictive', but from the practical point of view from which alone we looked at it it was in our view no more restrictive than the draft of the 13th March 1934 and had the same meaning. Under the March draft we considered that we v/ere liable for Company imports for the personal use of its employees, but the Company in practice imports nothing for the personal use of its employees for v/hich they do not pay. It is simply our experience elsewhere which led to the suggestion from one of our staff recently returned from Persia of a rewording to render impossible claims recently made in that country by the Customs officials. Among several instances I can quote that of coir matting imported solely for placing underneath 10,000 ton tanks, which Customs have argued might be used for the dirty feet of our employees and therefore was dutiable as an article/r 2 . h /rf article imported for their personal use. Since you explained in your letters of the 15th an d 26th Novemher the existing and prospective restrictions on that avaricious Shaik’s powers of taxing British employees, the position appears quite changed as a practical question. As I have explained to you, since our redraft of the 25th October, what our previous experience has frightened us of is not 5 $&gt; duties, hut such situations as now exist in Persia, where for example an oil heating stove brought to Abadan at a c.i.f. cost of 17s.lOd. costs if landed £3.11.9, and an oil cooker with a c.i.f. cost of £7.7.3 costs £25.14.5 landed. If you had ever to do work outside in such a country you would again appreciate the difficulty of producing contentment in the staff with beer at a cost of 2 s. 6 d. or more a bottle’. In view therefore of the prospect of import duties of btfo or thereabouts we should be ready to take the risk of any misinterpretation of the wording of Article 10 in this rospect as it stood in the draft of the 13th March last. Yours sincerely, L. LEFROY.? v / 3.v Air i.ai P.Z. 7970/34. Ly dear powle, '-7 INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Dm Oi'NfiCEHTlAt BEOOm iaany triaziKs for your D.0.1165-3 of lOtn December about clauses 4 and '5 of the Qatar oil concession an» Government Agreement. a. I do not think any difficulty will arise on the point you raise, as to which we agree entirely with you. You will see from the final record of the discussion held here with representatives of the Hoyal Dutch and the A.P.O.C. to discuss the concession, on 21st march, (copies sent to you, India and Bahrein by the air mail of 31st march under P.2.19.99/34) that it was maae clear to the Company, with reference to Article 4 of the draft Agreement that 11 it was possible that H.M.G. might decide to designate the Political Agent Bahrein as Political Agent also in -Qatar* and Article 4 as drafted would cover this, though in so far as the P.A. might not be resident in Qatar, the TT y obligation/ -on'ble Lt.Col. T.C. Powle, C.B.E., / 'TT xhe Residency, / Bushire.fm) obligation to conduct local relations through the political representative of H.M.G. would in practice have to he interpreted rather more loosely. Mr. Agnew «&lt; and Mr. Hearn took note of this and saw no objection. You will remember, ^oo, that the point was touched on at our meeting with the A.P.O.C., at which you were present, on 10th October, when Walton reminded the Company that H.M.G. had at present no permanent representative at ^tar and that communications would probably have to pass through the political Agent at Bahrein^ though we did not in fact think it worth including a reference to this in the record of the meeting, as the position was in our view entirely covered by the conversations which had taken place in March, referred to above. 3. I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and to Loch. Yours sincerely,Note or discussion at the India Office with the Anglo- persian Oil Company, regarding Persian Gulf oil questions, on Thursday, 10th January 1935. Mr.Walton and I saw Mr.Lefroy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company amd Mr.Mylles today. 2 , Qatar Oil. The Company’s representatives said that Mr.Mylles was probably returning to Qatar by the air mail of the 22nd January to resume negotiations with the oheikh. Mr.Mylles thought that there was a reasonable chance oi agreement with the Sheikh ana did not think there was any risk of the Sheikh negotiating with other parties within the period of the option which he had grantea to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company though he had reason to believe that overtures of an unofficial character continued to be made to him by the Hasa Oil Company. The intermedary tor ouch overtures was understood to oe Sheikh Nazir, a brother the Sheikh, resident in Hasa. I' V 3. Mr.Lefroy said that the Company were anxious . (a) to secure the concurrency of His Majesty’s Government in certain modifications in^tfie drait ox the ^atar oil concession dated 25th jjd'tober 1934 (copies ot wh^ch have been circulated to the interested departments), and (b) to reach agreement as to the map to be attached any concession granted* 4. As regards the first of these points, the amendments which they desired were the follov/ing:- (i) Preamble, line 7. For 'lawful heirs 1 2 3 4 ’ substitute 'successors”• &gt; * (if)/# , im Or (ii) Article 4(c)(2) After 'royalty' insert 'per ton (2240 English pounds)'* (iii) Article 4(c)(3) After 'royalty' insert 'per thousand cubic feet'. (iv) Article IQj sub-paragrauh 1, line 3« After 'lorries' insert 'aircraft'. ffu L (v) Article 10, sub-paragraph 1, last sentence* Revise to read: 'General merchandise and food supplies imported by it for the personal use of its employees the ordinary duty on goods of British merchants in force in the State of Qatar (vi) Article 15, page 8 &gt; line 3* Omit 'subject r to the approval of the Political Resident'. (vii) Article 17, line 2. For 'own men' substitute 'subjects'. (viii) Omit Article 20. ^ K j f • (ix) Article 21. line 2. Omit 'lawful'. (x) Article 21. lines 6/7. For 'In this Agreement the English text shall prevail' substitute '’in either text’ the Sheikh and the Company agree to settle the matter by mutual -discussion, lailing which they will refer the matter to arbitration in accordance with Article 16'. (xi) New Article 22* Insert 'The terms year, month, day, as used in this Agreement reier to the solar calendar of England and to no other ’• 5. The Company’s representatives were informed alter discussion that no objection was seen to alterations (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above; (v), having regard to the terms of the treaty between His Majesty’s Government and Qatar and to the correspondence which had passed on this subject, was also unobjectionable. As for (vi), it was not quite clear whether the proviso had been inserted in the interests/interests of the Company or of His Majesty’s Government, hut in view of the arbitration provisions of Article 16 no objection was seen to accepting the Company’s proposal. No objection was seen to (vii). As regards (viii), the Company explained that the Sheikh conducted no banking transactions and liked his payments in cash. He would not welcome a reference to a bank (the reference had been inserted by the Company in the hope that it might facilitate dealings with the Sheikh). It was agreed that if this was the case there was no point in pressing for the inclusion of the Article. No objection was seen to (ix). As regards (x), it was impressed on the Company that it was in their interest as well as to some extent that of His Majesty’s Government that provision should be made that the English text should prevail. They replied that the Sheikh of Qatar had very strongly urged that he knew no English himself,had no one in his State who knew English and did not employ for banking or for other purposes anyone with a knowledge of English. It was felt that in these circumstances there was some justification for his request and the Company were informed that if they found it impossible to secure his acceptance of the Article as drafted they might assume our concurrence in their redraft* No objection was seen to (xi). The object of the alteration was to prevent confusion owing to the use of a lunar calendar by the Sheikh. 6 . The Company undertook to furnish a revised text of the Agreement. 7. As regards the second point referred to in paragraph 3 above, the Company referred to the map produced hy the Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologists (copies of which/which vV ere circulated in February 1934), vrtiich showed a southern boundary i'cr Qatar which had been indicated to the geologists by the Sheikh himself on the ground. The Company were anxious to know whether this boundary was satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government for the purposes of the map to be appended to any agreement under the provisions of Article 2. jj * 4 They understood that there had been considerable recent discussion between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud over this boundary. The suggestion was even rumoured to have been made by Ibn Saud but not accepted that failing agreement commissioners might be appointed by the two parties to settle the difficulty. The Jebel Dukhan seemed likely to form part of a definitely oil bearing structure and Ibn Saud was thus anxious to include the whole of it in his territory and so in the Hasa oil concession, while the Sheikh was not prepared to accept his view and claimed that his boundary ran either as shewn in his map or south of it to Salwa. The Company were informed that the important thing seemed to be the limit of their concession, which need not necessarily be as extensive as that of the Sheikh’s territories recognised by His Majesty’s Government, or of any protection which they might give to him. it would, however, be necessary to examine the limit which they were anxious to fix with the other interested Departments. It was agreed in these circumstances that the Company should furnish copies of a map showing the suggested boundary and that endeavours should be made to let them have a decision before Mr.Mylles’s departure for Qatar °n 22nd January. The point was important as it would be necessary to attach the map to the concession put forward to the Sheikh. 8./8 . Mr.Mylles, in conclusion, was asked what difficulties in particular he anticipated with the Sheikh. He replied that the main difficulty would, of course, he finance* The Sheikh, on the other hand, was also suspicious of references to the Political Resident or of suggestions of closer control by His Majesty’s Government. The Company could see no alternative to the reference to the Political Resident in Article 16 of the draft or they would have suggested one. But it might be that there would be difficulty on this point. The Company were given no reason to hope that His Majesty’s Government would accept any modification of the draft on this point. Koweit Neutral Zone. Mr.Lefroy said that the Company had no further information as to developments in Neutral Zone. He was informed that His Majesty’s Government were unaware of how matters at present stood, but that Mr.Janson, Jnr. had some time ago intimated that the Arabian Development Syndicate, who retained an active interest in this question, were endeavouring to follow up their earlier negotiations, but would, if they secured a concession, be prepared to transfer it to the Anglc- Persian Oil Company on reasonable terms, e.g. something corresponding to cut of pocket expenses plus an understanding about royalty. Th® Company’s representatives were informed that no difficulties were seen about giving them this information, as there had been no suggestion that it was confidential. 10. Mr.Lefroy, after further discussion, enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would see any objection to the despatch of an I.P.C. geologist or representative to endeavour to secure from the Sheikh of Koweit an understardigrfi 6 in respect of the Neutral Zone corresponding to that which was understood to have been reached between Ibn Saud and the btandard Oil* He was informed that prima facie we saw no objection to action on these lines, which indeed, closely corresponded to what had previously b#en discussed with the Anglo-Her sian Oil Company, but he was invited to make a proposal lor consideration in wilting. -Ql&gt; i n . Dhabi. Mr.Lefroy referred to the lact that, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, facilities had been given to an Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologist to assist the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi by sinking wells, an operation in the course of which he might have some opportunity of assessing the oil possibilities of this area. The geologist who had b^en sent was interested in his results, and the Company desired to take matters further The discovery of petroliferous strata in Bahrein (coupled with the probability that there was a valuable petroliferous stratum in Hasa and in the Jebel Dukhan in Qatar) had led to increased interest in this whole area What would be our attitude towards the despatch of the American exploratory geologist who had now been attached to the I.P.C., with a small party, to conduct further researches in Abu Dhabi? IS* Mr.Lefroy was informed that we were very anxious to facilitate the task of the British element in the I.P.C. of establishing themselves in these areas. But we should not at all welcome the despatch to the Trucial Coast of an American, or of any foreigner. As he and Mr.Mylies were aware, even English nationals were not at present allowed into the Trucial States except in quite exceptional circumstances./circumstances. To send down an American geologist, following especially on the establishment of the Standard Oil in Hasa and in Bahrein, might moreover very well prejudice their negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar and might leave on the local Sheikhs &amp;c* the impression that the Americans were the interest of real importance. Would they in these circumstances consider, even though it might cause them inconvenience, finding an English geologist to do the work? if sc, no obstacles would be placed in his way and he would be given all facilities. The Company would appreciate the political considerations involved, and the fact that the preferable alternative for His Majesty's Government to allowing exploration or development of these areas by foreigners was to close them (as had been their policy hitherto) for purposes of oil development to all parties# Mr.Lefroy undertook to consider the matter further.
