Dear Sir Dupert, ■ q|^ ^ Haase refer to the correspondence resting with the enclosure to your Complimentary Slip No* 57/2/49 of the 14th January, 1949. 2. Some three weeics ago in the course of a general conversation with the Sheiich I said that I foresaw a good deal of trouble between his Bclice in -dimedi and the British and American residents there unless his Bodice cooperated very closely with our Special Bolioe. I also mentioned the problem of arrests of Europeans and Americans outside the Company’s areas - and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Special Police -, and also the difficulty of guarding them if we had to imprison them in any prison he might build for persons subject to our jurisdiction. I suggested that he might consider employing some British personnel for these purposes. 3. He Informed me today that he has asiced Kemp, his agent in London, to try to find him three British Sergeants or Inspectors formerly employed in the some Bailestinian Police who had/knowledge of Arabic- two to work in Ahicedi with Sheikh Jabir and one to remain in Kuwait, He agreed that they could eventually look after European and American prisoners also. 4. You might think it advisable to ask the Foreign Office to assist Kemp to get suitable men ; and also to see that their contracts make it possible for us to look after their interests here if necessary. H.E* Sir Hupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Hesident, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. Yours ever, / 4CCPY (5&gt; The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 57/7/49 21st June, 1949. /S I forward herewith a copy of a letter from Jackson from which it will be seen that the Shaikh is now trying to obtain the services of three British Police Sergeants or Inspectors through Kemp. This is very satisfactory and if you see no objection I should be very grateful if Kemp could be assisted in obtaining suitable men and if their contracts could be scrutinised as suggested by Jackson in the last paragraph of his letter. 2. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to Jackson. } a B.A.B. Burrows, Esq., The Foreign Office, London.No. C//S&lt;S ( The Political Agency, Kuwait. 13th July, 1949. Please refer to your letter No. 57/7/49 of the 21st June, 1949, to Burrows. 2. I understand from the Sheikh that Izzat Jaffir, who is now in the Lebanon, has engaged there a British Sergeant or Inspector who had 5 years’ service in the Palestinian Police; and that Kemp has found two bachelor police Constables or Sergeants in England who are willing to come out to Kuwait in September. 3. Abdulla Mubarar who is in Damascus has also taken on some more Arab officers of the former Palestinian Police. Yours ever, E.

Kemp has assured us that he has explained to Parry the difficulties of the set-up in Kuwait and has pointed out to him that he can have no legal redress in this country if things go wrong. Unfortunately I&amp;rry does not speax Arabic (none of the candidates seen by Kemp did) but he is arranging to study the language here to fit himself for the appointment should the Sheixh accept Kemp’s recommendation. In the circumstances we have decided that it would not be politic for us to suggest to the Iheixh that the terms of the proposed contract, which Kemp has drafted on his own responsibility on the basis of the oil companies’ usual contracts, should include a clause aopointing the Political Agent as arbitrator in the event of any dispute regarding its terms. Ue nave however mentioned the point to .emp. You will be interested to Know that Kemp has told us that the Sheixh has asxed him to find three men, possibly ex-Palestine Police Force, to assist in re-organising the Kuwait police guards, etc. The proposal is, however, still embryonic as the question of terms has still to be clarified. I I am sending a copy of this letter without enclosures to Jacxson. V/e have now heard from Kemp that he has recommended Yours sincerely, ieutenant-Colonel Sir Hupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., BAHREIN.r' ■m u\Utf Telegram Cole From Prodrome, Bahriin To Political Kuwait No. 201 Dated the 21st received 22nd July, 1949 CQOHPAPTE has heard that vacancies in Police in Kuwait have been advertised in U.K. Could you state basic salary, allowances if any house provided transport nature of duty prospects. He is very happy with Bahrain Govern ment but would naturally seize any opportunity of advancement particularly if work were con genial to &amp;im. He would be very grateful for details and for your advice. Please treat as personal as he does not wish Bahrain Government to know of this enquiry. JACKINS.No.C/^/? (4/44) THE POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT, &amp; ^ Augu st, 1949. Please refer to your letter No.57/7/49 of the 21st June to Burrows. 2. As I told you when you passed through on your way from the United Kingdom. I had heard from Kemp that the contracts for the two Police officers engaged by him contained a clause subjecting the officers to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh’s Tribunals when in Kuwait, instead of to our jurisdiction under the Kuwait Order in Council. j S. The two officers arrived here on the 20th August and were shortly followed by a third engaged in Beirut - my letter No.C/186 dated the 13th July, 1949 - whose contract contained a similar clause. 4. I took an early opportunity of discussing their contracts with them and explained to them and to the Sheikh that they could not by private contract opt^ out of His Majesty’s Government's jurisdiction over them conferred by the Kuwait Order in Council. 5. The Sheikh has since informed me that he had no intention or desire to curtail our jurisdic tion; and both he and the officers agreed that new contracts should be signed without the clause about jurisdiction. This has now been done. V H.E. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE.,CSI., Political resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.CON flDENTIAL 220/4/49 The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, 25th October, 1949 I visited Kuwait from the 8th to the 10th £* October on my way to Cairo fcor and Aden. The Sheilch called on me at the Agency at 9 a.m. on the 9th and the conversation was of a formal and colourless nature. I Immediately returned the call accompan ied by Jackson and as soon as we were seated the Shei-sh in somewhat circumlocutory language made an apology for his behaviour to me during his visit to Bahrain last June. I said quite briefly that I had been deeplyoffended but agreed to let bye- gones be byegones. I was the more ready to do this as not only has JacKson on more than one occasion pointed out to him the error of his ways but since his return from Bahrain his attitude tov/ards us has been more than usually satisfactory. In fact I found Ihe general atmosphere at Kuwait better than I have ever Known it and left the place v/ithout the feeling of depression and frus tration which I usually experienced on previous visits. Parry, is an excellent man. e appears to liKe the job and should prove a great success. In I addition to a British matron the SheiKh is tryin to obtain the services of two more British doctors one to wor£ as an anaesthetist and the other as an eye-specialist. The new hospital has now been equipped and is a yoing concern. The three British police officers are settling down and are of the greatest assistance to the Political Agent. They are however employed only for dealing with persons subject to the Order-in-louncil and play no part in the training of the local police. A fine new thoroughfare has been completed from the Customs jetty to the main square and at numerous points in the town traffic police deal fairly efficiently with the constant stream of motor vehicles. On the educational side a number of small boys of primary school age have been sent to the Victoria College at Alexandria and it has been decided to indefatigable in keeping in close personal touch with Sheixh Ahmad and with the more important members of the ruliny family and leading merchants and the improved atmosphere which I found there is in my opinion largely attributable to his energy and ability. I am very sorry indeed that he is leaving us so soon. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to TroutbecK and Jackson. 2 The Sheikh’s new Chief Medical Officer send no more boys from the secondary classes to Cairo. 3.
