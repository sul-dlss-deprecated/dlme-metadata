R.Dunbar, Esq., OC. ^C. , Foreign Office, S«W.l. Yours sincerely, F. A. K. HARRISOMPlease refer to the submission at Ext,2515/45 on the subject of Ibn Saud's enquiry whether there is any objection to the flying of the Saudi Arabian flag by his carmercial agent at Koweit, The position under international law/is given in the Foreign Office’s letter of the 21st July. The Foreign Office seem rather inclined to suggest that if the flying of national flags in similar circumstances was permitted generally at Koweit, the Apt would lose its significance* Actually, however, I do not think that there are any other trade agents there, though the Persians and Iraqis would no doubt like to establish agents if th^y could* I think that we should stick to the view (with which the Government of India hadVagreed) that flag flying should be prevented* A draft telegram to the Political Resident in which it is proposed to seek the concurrence | of the Foreign Office is attached accordingly. In view of the international position revealed, I think it might be a good thing to make similar prohibitions in the other Arab sheikhdoms and a sentence suggesting this is included in the draft*- rSosi PlLc. uOP^ POREIW OPPIGE, 8 .,.1. (T 8305/7809/1 Dear Harrison* 7 V) *EXi'^ 8t Ju:Ly ’ 1945 ^ i 3610 - 4, In your litter (BxW-25 15 /45 of the 2nd Jun e about the flying of the Saudi-Arabian flag by the Saudi- Arabian Trade Agent at Kov, f eit* you suggested a way of explaining to the Saudi Government why this could not be allowed. Unfortunately we do not think that the flying of his national flag by a Trade Agent without consular status .could in fact be held to be contrary to international convention or custom* though it might well be contrary to the laws and regulations of the particular country in which he was stationed. That would not be so in the case of a foreign Trade Agent here, who would be allowed to fly his national flag without hindrance* whether he possessed consular status or not. We feel therefore that the only satisfactory way to handle the matter is on the basis of local regulations. If there is a law in Koweit which prohibits the flying of national flags by foreigners without consular status, we could then tell Ibn Saud that such is the case. If there is no such law, then either one will have to be made or the Trade Agent, in conmon with anyone else, must be allowed to fly his flag. Incidentally, the more freely foreign flags are flown, the less is any special significance likely to attach to the flying of such by particular individuals. P.A.K.

Oil interests and the recent visit of Mr.Knabenshue, American Minister in T Iraq to Kuwait. Sir, With reference to the recent visit of the above named distinguished personage to Kuwait on 28th March 1934, I have the honour to report some interesting points which, I think, may be found of interest to His Majesty’s Government, (a) Major Holmes infer mod me after the Minister’s departure that Mr.Knabenshue’a Secretary at a luncheon party ^iven in my house,asked him about the ' led Line Agreement”, and whether Kuwait could not be properly considered as falling within same. Mg jar Holmes said that he ”rode him off' tactfully, and gave an evasive fo.sy ^ reply, (in this ccnnection see Foreign Off ice,London No.123, dated 22.3.34 to Sir Percy Loreine, Bart., K.C.MG, ’ ' etc., Angora) • (b) Mr.Knabenshue, on more occasions then one took the trouble to emphasize to me rather more strongly than appeared necessary that his visit to the Gulf and especially to Bahrain and Kuwait was entirely unconnected with Oil, though some people seemed to think it was. (c) Mr.Knabenshue, before he left, asked my advice as to what would be the best course for him to follow, should Bin Saud either die or have a reverse or defeat in Yemen, when presumably there would be a period of chaos in the interior, which would certainly endanger the lives of uaerlean Geologists an&lt; -Notes.

Visit of German Minister, Baghdad and French Charge* d*Affaires, Baghdad with party to Kuwait. Sir, I have the honour to refer you to my Confidential Letter No.C-126, dated the 7th April 19 34 and to my telegram No.128, dated the 9th April 1934. 2 . I now forward for your information copies of the following telegrams in co naction with the visit to Kuwait of the German Minister, French Charge f d*Affaires, and French Consular Agent, Basra on 8 th April, which were received by me after I had sent off my Confidential No.C-126 to you informing you that I had n put off' the party. (a) Telegram No. 1 dated 6 th April 1934 from H.M’s Ambassador, Bagdad, (received late in evening on 6 th April)« (b) Telegram Bo.Nil, dated 7th April (received 7.30 P.M.) from H.B.M’s Consul, Basra. (o) Telegram Ho. Nil, dated 7th April (received 7 A.M. on 8 th April) from the French Consular Agent, Basra. 3. Telegrams (a) and (b) above were received by me aft€ despatch of my telegram No.Nil of 6 th April to Monsieur Asfar, French Consular Agent, Basra. So I think I had a right to presume that my informing him that there was no accommodation available in Kuwait for the visitors would have be on taken due notice of. 4* Telegram (c) arrived an hour before the party10 ./ (§&gt; - 2 - party reached Kuwait. 5 . For your further information, I beg to soy that on receipt of Monsieur Asfar’s letter of 3rd April (on 6 th April) and as soon as I had sent off my reply on 6 th, I called on the shaikh who was camped 7 miles away with hie family and informed him of the situation. He expressed his most profuse gratitude at the action X had taken, saying that he could not possibly have entertained any members of the party as his Palace in Kuwait was closed. 6 . It therefore came as an unpleasant shock to His Excellency when I had to inform him by hurried private note on the morning of the 8 th that the party was arriving inspite of my telegram putting them off. frot only did he express considerable annoyance to me when he saw me later in the day, but he asked how it was that I, his Political Agent, appeared unable to stop Europeans from coming down, who were not wanted by him or me • 7. While I have given you the above details of vfcat happened, the point I wish to bring out most of all is the unfortunate way this visit has been arranged. Clearly it was fixed up on the spur of the moment,, and neither the Shaikh 1 convenience nor mine was in the slightest degree considered. 8 . A still more important point to my mind is the fact that you, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ana my Chief, were neither informed nor consulted, which in the case of distinguished personage^ like the German Minister and French Charge t d f affaires in ’Iraq, appears to me to be strangely lacking in courtesy. 9. The Shaikh also noticed this omission, and aptly, I think, remarked that it was rather curious that proper steps had not been taken, as in the case of the ijmerioan Minister, to acquaint him of the coming arrival in his Capital, of important foreigners of ministerial rank.10. As things turned out, the party which arrived, con sisted of (a) Dr. Srobba (and wife), German Minister; (b) Monsieur Lepissier (and wife) French Charge 1 d*Affaires; (o) Dr.Hermann Suedhof, German Educational Expert, attached to ’Iraq Government; (d) Monsieur Aefar, French Consular Agent, Basra: nwfl x did my best to entertain than end show them round the Town personally, although I could offer them no food, as I had another large luncheon party on, consisting of Captain and Mrs.Howes, /jaerioan Missionaries and Imperial Airways Officers (latter stranded here). 11 . The party neither called on,nor left cards for, the Shaikh, and left again for Basra at 2 P.M. Monsieur Asfar before leaving apologized privately fcr the invasion, which he had done his best to stop on receipt of my wire. 12. //hilst in my house, Dr.Grobba and the French Charge’ d*Affaires put one or two very pointed questions regarding the activities of the new Kuwait Oil Company, and appeared to be perfectly aware of who Major Holmes and Mr .Chi sholm I were. They also asked whether it was true that the Political Resident was about to take up his residence at Bahrain. IS.

Please see previous submission on PiZ.5019/33 on tbe question oi' foreign consular representation in the Persian Gulf, with particular reference to possible difficulties at Banrein. The question generally wasi^iscussed with the Foreign Office and Colonel Fowle at a meeting held on 9th October, the minutes of which are flagged on P.Z.&amp;S45/33. The views of the Foreign Office on the conclusions of that meeting are contained in their official letter of List November now submitted. It will be remembered that tne Government of Inaia have asked that before any decision is taken they should be consulted (letter on P.Z.5019/33) and it has been made clear throughout the discussions with the Foreign Office that any conclusions must be subject to the Government of India’s comment (compare para.13 of the record of the meeting). 2. The minutes of the meeting are, I think, self-explanatory, as regards the Foreign Office letter it in general supports the conclusions reached on 9th October. The only modification suggested (viz. paragraph 2) is in the direction which we should prefer - they consider that the American Vice- Consul should not be allowed to carry on any official activity whatever in Bahrein or Koweit.. 3. It is for the Foreign Office to advise (as they have done in paragraphs 3 to 7 of their letter) as to what detailed arrangements will be necessary in the event of any foreign power expressing itself as dissatisfied with a mere general offer of the good offices of H.k.G. in one of the Gulf States.

Sir, l'. t . % Fo leion Office. 1935 J s.w.i. 21 st TTovenfber, With reference to Mr. Laithwaite’s letter No. P.Z. 6349/33 of the 14th October to Mr. Johnstone, enclosing the provisional minutes of a meeting held at the India Office on Monday, the 9th October, to consider the question of foreign consular representation in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, that, with the reservations set out below, he concurs both in the particular course cf action which is recommended in paragraph 4 of those minutes in the event of a visit of the United States Vice-Consul at Bushire to Bahrain, and also in the general principles to be followed in dealing with the question of foreign consular representation in this region, which are enumerated in paragraph 5 of the minutes. 2. There are, however, two points to which I am to request you to invite Sir Samuel Eoare’s attention. While concurring in the view expressed in paragraph 4 of the minutes that the United States Vice-Consul should not be allowed, even as a matter of courtesy, to perform any special acts in his consular capacity, Sir J. Simon considers that in practice, even if the Vice-Consul is allowed to perform such acts on the express understanding that they are not to be regarded as done in his consular capacity, it may subsequently be found difficult to refute LETT&amp;R 1 . the ULC3UFL i 4 7 23 NO' 1955 The Under Secretary of State, SENT TO India OfficeA- ^ the contention that they were in fact consular acts. It will, therefore, he better not to allow him to carry on any official \activity whatever in Bahrain or Koweit. 3. Secondly, in connexion with conclusion (d) in paragraph 5 of the minutes of the meeting, consideration has been given in this department to the question what measures would have to be taken in order to establish on a proper legal basis the services to be performed by British political officers for foreigners in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, supposing that, as postulated in conclusion (d), any foreign Power were not content with a general offer of the good offices of His Majesty’s Government and it became necessary to make some detailed arrangement on .that, subj ec t with the Power in question. 4^7 Taking the different classes of consular services in order; the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction in so far as Bahrain is concerned is already sufficiently provided for, in principle, by Article 8 (2) of the Bahrain Order-in-Council. The position will be the same in Koweit, if and when the proposed revised Koweit Order-in-Council is issued. f 5. As regards ordinary consular assistance and I protection, the legalisation of documents and the registration j of births, deaths and marriages, it will be sufficient if | instructions are issued by the Secretary of State to the officers concerned empowering them to perform the services in question. The recognition, however, by foreign courts or authorities of any registers which may be opened under these instructions must of course depend upon the local law of the foreign country concerned. 6.the Secretary of State sees no objection to the Political Agent keeping a register for the marriages of foreigners in Bahrain, in which he will record the particulars of marriages and the manner of their celebration. Registration of this way a celebration of marriage. ITor, as stated in paragraph 4 above, would such a register add any validity to the marriage or purport to do so, but it might assist in the proof of a marriage if the question whether it had been celebrated arose at a later date. reported by the parties to have been celebrated between them kind is merely a record of v/hat has taken place and is in no I am. Sir Your obedient Servant6 . There remains the question of the celebration of marriages. Sir John Simon considers it undesirable that the Political Agents at Bahrain and Koweit should perform marriages between foreigners. The celebration of marriages by British officers is under the Foreign Marriage Act and that Act only applies where one of the parties is a British subject. Although it may be legally possible to provide, by Order-in-Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, for formalities of marriage for foreigners subject to British jurisdiction, Sir John Simon does not consider it necessary or desirable to endeavour to legislate specially for the purpose of marriages by these officers between foreigners, to whom the Bahrain (or Koweit) Order-in-Council applies. In the first place, it is doubtful whether, for instance, such a marriage celebrated by the Political Agent at Bahrain between two United States citizens would possess increased validity in United States law owing to provisions for such marriages having been made by Order-in-Council. Again, United States law, and indeed the laws of most countries, contain principles similar to the English common law marriage under which marriages celebrated by a minister of religion or per verba de praesenti in countries where there is no local form available are recognised as valid. Since, therefore, in all probability no special legal provision by His Majesty’s Government for such marriages would increase their validity in the eyes of foreign governments, it seems best to leave them to be celebrated in one of the forms referred to above. 7. Finally, as regards the registration of marriages, the© . b) AT THE COURT AT WINDSOR CASTLE, The let day of April, 1922. Present, THE KING’S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. Mr. Secretary Shortt. Sir Frederick Fonsonby. Mr. Bridgeman. Whereas by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means, His Majesty the King has jurisdiction in Bahrein : NOW, THEREFORE, His Majesty, by virtue and in exercise of the powers in this behalf by the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, or otherwise in His Majesty vested, is pleased, by and with the advice of his Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows :— 1. This Order may be cited as “ The Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council, 1922 ” and shall be read as one with the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, hereinafter called “ the Princi pal Order.” 2 . The following provisions are substituted for Articles 51 to 59 inclusive of the Principal Order :— (1) A register of British subjects shall be kept in the office of the Political Agency. (2) Every British subject resident within the limits of this Order shall, in the month of January of each year, be registered at the Political Agency. A British sub ject arriving within the limits of this Order must apply for registration within one month after his arrival; provided that a person who fails to apply for or to obtain registration within the time limited by this Article may be registered at any 'time if he excuses his failure to the satisfaction of the Political Agent. (3) Where a person is in possession of a valid British pass port, the Political Agent shall, on the first registra tion of any such person, endorse without further fee than that provided for in sub-article (6) hereunder on the passport a certificate of registration in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. Where any such person applies for the renewal of the registration and produces his passport, the renewal of the registration shall, without further fee than that provided for in sub-article (6) hereunder be endorsed thereon.2 (4) Every person who has not previously been registered applying to be registered under this Order shall, unless excused by the Political Agent, attend personally for that purpose at the Political Agency, but any person applying for the renewal of his registration need not attend personally unless directed by the Political Agent so to do, provided that the registration of the wife or wives of a man who is registered under this Order may, if living with him, be effected without their personal attendance being required and provided also that the registration of minors, being his relatives in what ever degree, living with the head of a family who is registered under this Order, may be effected without their personal attendance being required. (5) A person registered in any register of British subjects established under the provisions of any Order in Council which have been repealed shall be registered under the provisions of this Order unless the Political Agent is satisfied after enquiry that the previous regis tration was erroneous or that such person is not entitled to registration under the provisions of this Order. (6) Every person shall, on every registration of himself, and on every renewal of the registration pay a fee of one rupee or such other fee as the Secretary of State from time to time appoints. The amount of the fee may be uniform for all persons, or may vary according to the position and circumstances of different classes, if the Secretary of State from time to time so directs, but may not in any case exceed three rupees. (7) Where any person applies to be registered, he shall be entitled without a fee, to the assistance of the Political Agent in the preparation of any affidavit that may be required. (8) The Political Agent may require the production of such evidence that an applicant for registration is entitled to the status of a British subject as he may see fit, but subject to such directions as may be issued by the Secretary of State. (9) If any British subject neglects to obtain registration under the provisions of this Order, he shall not be entitled to be recognised or protected as a British subject within the limits of this Order, and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding 25 rupees for each in stance of such failure, but he shall, although not regis tered, be subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts established by the Principal Order. 3. From and after the commencement of this Order, Articles 51 to 59 inclusive of the Principal Order are hereby repealed but such repeal shall not prejudice any rights, obligations or liabilities accrued thereunder. .OCvlUij3 (1) Ihis Order shall take effect as soon as it is first ex hibited in the office of the Political Agent, and that date is in this Order referred to as the commencement of the Order. (2) For that purpose the Political Agent shall, on the receipt by him of a certified printed copy of the Order cause the same to be affixed and exhibited conspicuously in That office.

Johnstone, Esq., Foreign Office S.S. 1.F pr ovisional Minutes of meeting held at I ndia Office on Monday. 9th October, to consider the question of foreign consular representation_i n t he Persian Gulf . There v/ere present Mr, Laithwaite (in the Chair), Lieutenant Colonel T.C.Fowle, O.3.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Mr, K.R,Johnstone, Foreign Office. Mr. Laithwaite said that the meeting arose out of Bushire despatch No.647 S of 20tn July to the Government of India, on the subject of foreign consular representation in Bahrein. 6he Government of India had since intimated that they saw no objection to the discussion of the points in issue by the Political Resident during his leave in this country, but that they wished to be informed of what took place at the discussion and consulted before any decision was taken. 2. The question had arisen in connection with the possibility of an American request to be allowed consular representation in Bahrein; but it seemed desirable not merely to deal with this specific point, but also so far as possible to endeavour to reach agreement on certain broad principles as regards foreign consular representation in the Gulf States. The question was probably a live one in Bahrein and Koweit only, (the position of Muscat being of course special) though it might arise in Qatar in the event of oil being developed in that principality/ COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL(|06) 2. principality. There was no likelihood at tins stage of the question of foreign consular representation arising in the Trucial area. 3. The meeting first discussed the question of the action to be taken in the event of the American Vice-Consul at Bushire repeating his visit to Bahrein/snowing signs of consular activity or raising the question whether there would be any objection to his performing consular acts in that Principality. The Acting Political Resident had su^ested that it might be sufficient on the first occasion, if the Consul were to show signs of such activity, for the political Agent to draw his attention to the Exclusive Agreement of 1892, between the Sheikh of Bahrein and H.M.G. If the question were then to arise of the Consul performing some specific act at Bahrein, such as the solemnisation of marriage, which was not within the powers of the Political Agent, the Political Agent mi^it reply that as a matter of courtesy he would raise no objection on that particular occasion provided that a request for the act was made by the person concerned through the Political Agent. The Political Agent might add, should circumstances appear to necessitate this, that the question of future procedure would be referred to H.M.G. 4. The general sense of the meeting was in favour of action on the lines suggested by the Acting Political Resident, with the modification however that it would be undesirable that the American Consul should be allowed to perform in his consular .. capacity any special act even as a matter of courtesy. 5 ./3 . 5. The meeting then turned to consider the possi bility of laying down general principles applicable in the case of Koweit and Bahrein and possibly Qatar, The India Office suggested these might be as follows:- (a) that we should oppose any attempt to establish foreign consular representatives;. (b) that we should if necessary arrange for the ruler concerned to inform us that he was strongly opposed to their establishment; (c) that if any foreign Power were to raise thepoint we should explain our special Treaty relation with the States in question, and the objections of the local ruler, adding that we were not prepared to bring pressure to bear upon the ruler in the matter, but that we would gladly give our fullest good offices to any of the citizens of the interested Foreign Powers who might find themselves in the Sheikhdoms concerned and would instruct our representative to look after their interests; (d) that in the events referred to in (c) above it might be possible by friendly arrangement with the foreign Power concerned to agree, should that Power consider a mere offer of good offices in general that insufficient,,/&amp;cts which are normally consular acts such as the solemnisation of marriage should be performed as a matter of courtesy (but not as Consular Acts) by the Political Agent, whose action in the matter would be recognised by the interested foreign Powers. 6. Mr. ^aithwaite referred to the previous history of this question. The position of Muscat vras special. It was an independent State with foreign treaties of its own and it would not be possible for us to take exception to a request by an interested foreign Power to establish a consulate at Muscat. The meeting agreed. 7. The Sheikh of Koweit was precluded by his Treaty engagements from receiving the representatives of any foreign power save with the-approval of There had been considerable correspondence between 1924/4. &amp;) 1924 and 1932 as to the possihility of appointing Persian, Iraqi, or Saudi consular representatives in the Sheikhdom. The .Sheikh had taken the strongest exception to any such proposal and it had been necessary to overrule him before we could undertake even to offer our goou offices to Persian subjects in Koweit. (We had in this connection informed the Persian Government in 1924 that the appointment of a Persian representative even in an honorary capacity would be contrary to the Agreement of 1899 between the sheikh and H.M.G. and that any departure from this agreement infavour of Persia would create a precedent which would prove embarrassing in the event of any other Powers proposing to appoint representatives.) When a suggestion was maue at the beginning of 1930 that an Iraqi Vice Consul should be appointed at Koweit, Sir Francis Humphrys was similarly instructed to reply that H.M.G. were not prepared, having regard to the Agreement of 1899, to sanction the appointment of foreign consular representatives and the natter was not pursued by the Iraqi Government. The 3aud_i Government had raised the question in 1932 with Sir Hugh Biscoe, but had dropped it on their attention being drawn to the fact that the grant of consular status/status to their representatives would make it difficult for us to refuse a consular concession to the Persians. political Resident and the Government of Inaia had been definitely opposed in 1928 to a proposal, made with the oeject of reconciling Persia to the abandonment of her claims to the Islands, to establish a Persian Agent in the island for face-saving purposes and had reported that such a proposal would have to be forced on the Sheikh with baa reactions a long the Arab littoral. The appointment of any foreign consular representative would make it difficult to refuse a similar -concession to the Persians and the Saudi Government aid it seemed probable that the objections of the sheikh of Bahrein to any such proposal would be no less definite than those of the Sheikh oi Koweit. 9. Golonel Fowle expressed h is general agreement with the suggested principles and with the course of action outlined above. the past and would still be very strongly opposed to any foreign representation in his State. The same was true of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Apart from any general political objections to the establishment of foreign representation such representation would have to be forced on the/ 8 . In the case of Bahrein the He said that the Sheikh of Koweit6. @ the sheikh. If the Sheikh was definitely obstinate, while we might overrule him as we had in Koweit, as regards the grant of good offices to foreign subjects, it would be most difficult, if not impossible, for us to oblige him to accept foreign representatives. 10. Llr. Johnstone said that he thought the Foreign Office would not, in the light of tiie Fo-sident's rerrarks, be disposed to dissent from the principles under discussion. It coula not, however, be overlooked that while we might shelter behind the Sheikhs in refusing to accept foreign representatives, we should be quite unable to convince foreign Powers that the sheikh was not in fact acting under our instructions. This might lead to some difficulties. 11. Colonel Fowle admitted that this might be the case. Bute ven so it made no difference to the facts. The objection of the local rulers was real end sincere. In any event foreign Powers could not get behind our statement. 12. As regards principle (d) above Fr. Johnstone stated that there appeared to be three particular consular acts in regard to which difficulty was most likely to arise between the Political Agents at Bahrein or Koweit and foreign nationals, I namely the solemnisation of marriages, the/© 7- the registration of births and deaths and the granting of extensions to visas. As regards the first and ( second - apart from any exceptions which foreign Governments might be inclined to make in the case of marriages, similar to the recognition accorded in English common law to marriages in uncivilised countries contracted in any solemn form - it would in any case be necessary to obtain the consent of the foreign Government concerned to the 1 opening of registers of marrkges, births and deaths recognised by them. And as regards the e xtension of visas, this \ function also could clearly only be delegated to British Political Officers with the consent of the foreign Government concerned. 13. The general sense of the meeting was would be^ best, subject to acceptance 01 the general principles suggested above oy higher authority in the departments concerned and by the Government of India, to deal with specific incidents as they might arise.

It may be convenient to indicate to what extent it has already formed the subject of discussion and the recent history of this question in the major Gulf states is'given in the precis attached. The gaaaaat is of immediate importance only in connection with Bahrein. 3* As regards Bahrein, I think on the whole that the course of action suggested in paragraphs 14 and 15 of Colonel Loch’s despatch is the best in all the circumstances. We have not, I think, ever formally brought our agreement with Bahrein to the notice of the U.3. Government, though we have, in connection with Bahrein oil, made it clear to them that we occupy a special treaty position in the Gulf area.

But it is now some years since there has been a resident representative of either country, and the British Consul and Political Agent usually looks after the foreign interests concerned. From our point of view this condition of affairs is naturally very satisfactory. But the position of Muscat is peculiar because it is an independent state and not under our protection in any way, and it has foreign treaties of its own. It would in these circumstances he in practice impossible for us to take exception to a request by an interested foreign power to establish a Consulate at Muscat. Komi. 2. Koweit, like Bahrein, is an independent Arab state under British protection but not a British protectorate. Its foreign relations are wholly controlled by us and it is precluded by its treaty engagements from receiving the representatives of any foreign power save with the consent of H.M.G. In 1924 the Persian Consul at Basra informed the P.A. Koweit that he was sending a representative to issue passports to Persian subjects residing in Koweit, and asked for the assistance of the P.A. The P.A. reported to H.M.G. that the Sheikh would not welcome the visit of a Persian official ’’especially if he is helped by the Political Agent, regarding it as an encroachment on his jurisdiction over foreign subjects. It may lead to appeals to Persian Consul at Basra from Persians in Koweit.” After discussion with Tehran and an indication to the Persian Government that the Sheikh saw objection to the proposal, the Minister for Foreign iiffairs agreed to drop it. In/- 2 - 'ZT ' IIJoflvT PlH-o'J- ‘ 'tk' 3 * In April 1925 the Persian Government, who stated that they were constantly being worried by local Persians, asked the support of H.M.G, in obtaining permission to appoint one of the Persian residents in Koweit as Honorary Consul to issue passports to Persians and obtain facilities for them. After consultation with the Sheikh and with H.M.G. the Persians were informed that foreigners were not required to possess passports in Koweit law; that since Persian regulations required Persian subjects to take out passports on leaving Persia it was considered that Persians in Koweit wishing to obtain passports should apply individually to the authorities at Bush ire and Ivnhammerah. ■*As regards other facilities the appointment of a Persian representative even in an honorary capacity would be contrary to the agreement completed between H.B.M. Government and the Bheikh of Koweit in 1899, and any derogation to this agreement in favour of Persia would create a precedent which would be embarrassing in the event of other powers desiring to appoint representatives. rt (Sir P. Loraine’s note of 3rd July 1925, P.2527/25). 4. The Persians on receipt of this reply enquired whether R.lw.G* would consent to the P,A. or his assistant at Koweit assuming the dut*« of protecting Persian subjects there. It appeared that the measure of protection desired would iramt merely,the P.A. extending his general good offices to Persians resident In Koweit. The Sheikh was exceedingly reluctant to agree even to this measure of interest on our part in the position of foreigners and it was necessary finally to override him and to instruct the P.A. to deal with each case as it arises. The question of special protection for Iraqis arose in this connection. It/6/ - 3 r &lt;&lt;»7 T- It was pointed out, however, that under the Treaty of 1922 Iraqi subjects abroad were entitled to the good offices of H.M. representatives and that in these circumstances no case for special Iraqi representation in Koweit could be regarded as having arisen. 5* In January 1930 the High Commissioner in Iraq reported that the Iraq Government proposed to appoint an Iraqi Vice-Consul at Koweit. The Political Resident was strongly opposed to this proposal 'which, I think, would inevitably lead to similar requests from Bin Saud and Persia', while there was the further complication that yielding in regard to Koweit would inevitably affect the question of establishing a Persian agent in Bahrein, to which there were strong objections on other grounds. Sir Francis Humphrys was ultimately Instructed.to reply (the case being strengthened by the fact that there were estimated to be only some 30 Iraqi subjects in Koweit) that 'there are at present no foreign consular representativeE in Kuweit' and that 'H.M.G. are not prepared to agree, in accordance with the provisions of their Agreement with the Sheikh of 1899, to sanction the appointment of such foreign representatives. Were they to agree to the appointment of an Iraqi Vice-Consul it would be impossible lor them to withhold their consent to the appointment of consular officers in Koweit of other powers and in these circumstances they regret that it is not possible for them to make any exception of favour of Iraq to the policy which they have hitherto followed in this matter.' (Colonial Office telegram to the High Commissioner, No.123, dated 25th March 1930, on P.2089/30). The matter appears to have dropped.P.Z.2539/ 32. Bushire Despatch 10 dated 31/3/32, in file helow. m © - 4 - 6. In the course of Sir Hugh Biscoe's discussions with Ihn Saud in the early spring of 1932, the possibility of some consular status being afforded to Nejdi representatives in Bahrein and Koweit (in the latter case one Nafisi) was raised. As explained below the matter was not pressed in the case of Bahrein. But Yusuf Yasin went on to ask 'whether it would not be possible to give some sort of official status to Nafisi, Ibn Baud's trade agent at Koweit, since so far as he was aware there were no difficulties with Persians at that place. I replied that that was not altogether correct. The Persians did not claim Koweit, but did not recognise it, and impounded Koweiti passports if brought into Persia etc. it would in my opinion be extremely undesirable to allow the Persians to have a consular representative at Koweit, for reasons which he would doubtless appreciate, but if any consular status was accorded to Nafisi we could hardly refuse a similar concession to the Persians, who had a large number of subjects in Koweit. He saw the force of this argument and did not press the matterfurther.' The question of an American consular representative may become of very active importance here (as it is in tne case of Bahrein) in the event of the Koweit oil concession going to the Americans. rfQ have recently again taken up the question of securing authority from the sheikh to exercise jurisdiction over foreigners in his state. BAHREIN . 7. The history of the exercise of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein by the British political authorities in the islands is dealt with in the India Office memorandum of which a copy is attached. As Colonel Loch states in his despatch of 1st July, there have been various efforts/ /^S—5 efforts in the past by foreign powers to establish agents In Bahrein or to interfere in Bahrein affairs through their consuls elsewhere, but it has been possible successfully to resist such endeavours. 8* 1ft connection with the Persian treaty negotiations the question was raised in 1928 of giving Persia some sort of agent in Bahrein for face saving purposes in the event of her withdrawing wholly her claim to Bahrein. Both the Political Resident and the Government of India were very strongly opposed to this proposal, which, in the light of their views and of discussion in the Persian Gulf sub committee of the C.I.D., was abandoned by H.M.G. The Political Resident (telegram T.406 of 23rd September 1928) emphasised that in the first place the ruling family in Bahrein were Sunnis, while the Baharana were Shiahs, like the Persians. 'Presence of Persian agent would result In intrigues and formation of Shiah party whereby position of ruler would be imperilled as, unless Persian immigration were forbidden, it would demand on strength of numbers equal rights on existing councils and equal say in Bahrein affairs. Similar difficulty of legal status of Persians which exists in Iraq would arise; a demand for a similar concession in Dj^abai and Koweit would be produced by agent 1 s presence; Ibn Saud would insist on his agent being recognised also; and the clash of powerful interests would be too much for Sheikh of Bahrein whose power would be so diminished as to make him a figurehead. Sheikh is strongly opposed to any increase of Persian imluence.., so this proposal would have to be forced on him.' The Government of India, in expressing their agreement with the Resident (telegram N0.2123-S of 19th October 1928) remarked; 'Recognition of Persian accredited agent would have to/to be forced on Sheikh, with had reactions along the Arab littoral; would be dangerous in its local effect; would lead to requests for Persian representatives at Koweit, etc; would make similar and possibly even more dangerous claim by Bin Saud hardly resistible; and (unless we declare out and out protectorate) would weaken our own position in Bahrein, which is based largely on our admitting no guardianship of foreign interests other than ourselves.' The activities of the French Consul at Bushire, * T'' to which Colonel Loch refers in paragraph 4 of his despatch of 12th July, are of no special importance, given the absence of French subjects in Bahrein and do not call for serious consideration. The American difficulty is much more serious and real. For many years past there have been American missionaries in Bahrein, who, in the words of the late Colonel ^arrett, act as very effective unofficial American representatives. The Bahrein Petroleum Company under the conditions of the assignment to them of the oil concession granted in 1925 to the Eastern and General syndicate are required to maintain as many British subjects in their organisation as is consistent with its effective conduct. • At the moment there are apparently some eight Americans employed in the higher administration, but no British subjects but the Company recently indicated that they were training too British engineers to come out. 1;L * Saudi representation in Bahrei n. Ibn Saud is unofficially represented in Bahrein by the Qusabi family. He has from time to time made efforts to secure some more special degree of recognition for them, it is unnecessary to enter in detail into the earlier history of this question, but/L oltf &amp; - 7 - but it may te noted that the possibility of consular status being afforded to his representative v/as raised during Sir Hugh Biscoe^ visit to the King in February 1932. Sir Hugh Biscoe remarked; 'The question was raised by Yusuf Yasin...and he began by asking me whether it would not be possible to accord some consular status to a Nejdi representative at Bahrein. I replied by saying that he knew how delicate was the position at Bahrein vis-a-vis the Persians, who had not yet abandoned their claim; that there ! was a very large Persian colony at Bahrein; and that if we allowed the Hejaz-Nejd Government to have a consular j representative the Persians would inevitably put forward a similar demand - in fact, they had already made a request to this effect to which H.M.G. had not acceded. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin admitted the force in this contention and did not press the matter any further in respect of Bahrein.”GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. t) *9 Foreign and Political Department.

The fees appropriate to the various matters have been paid. 2n one or two cases the authorities ui the United States of -^Eierxca thcuucelves suggested to their nationals that 'legalisetion* by the Pollucal Agent would be acceptable, X shall naturally do my best to ensure that no diffiettiUes occur,wnidh may give rise among the -ascricrja CaiMmunitOr to a wish to have their own Consul on the u^ottJae work, but wIUl a rapidly growing CoMunity/and the poeeibility of diffioultiee 9 wili increase. W. Ihe tlae must ineritably come when difficulties will arise, xiideed.a difficulty threatened only a few weeks ago, when there was a possibility (l am told that the betting was at one time 6 to 4 onJ) of another marriage taking place. In the ease of the marriage mentioned above one of the parties was a missionary of the 'uosriean Mission,and both were content to be married oy a Minister of the hutch Reformed Church. I am not sore thax, the other couple would have been so content. Immediately would have arisen the question:- ‘ xo\i have not the authority to carry out an ordinary every day act like marriage; yet you have a treaty under which you say that we cannot have our Consul here to do these acts; what is to be done about it?* 10. -apart from any question of Treaty rights,it would be most undesirable to have a Consul of the United States of America in 3ahrain # as with the Oil interests at his back,he wouxd be likely rapidly to acquire a powerful poeition - indeed, he might well tend to supplant the Political Agent. Moreover, if any one country were to be permitted to establish a Consulate it %»©uxd be diiiioult to refuse the same privilege to others - especially to Persia (though this would mean the disappearence oi i+LV claims to sovereignty) and to 3a*udi Arabia. I have reason to believe moreover, that the Bahrain Government would view with anxiety the possibility of the establishment of any foreign Consul in Bahrain. 11. The immediate question is what attitude the Political -gciit in to adopt,if and when the American Consul at Baghdad repeats his visit to Bahrain (as he may well do in the coming cold weather;,and if he shows signs of Consular activity or c;e^e, whether there is any objection to his,for example, issuing aiwuftttitvjrt, aar solc&amp;aixlaf a isiaxrlc^ra. 5c-i of th &lt;&gt;&amp;9 ac ts aan lx performed Ib^ tk« ?#Utlaal Agftftt lor a Oiti^eii of tiio United states of ^aerica, 12* I do not kRow, and fUiouId be ^rntofwd If X might lx inf oriiod, who they ftdpp vrith. ^ecbxaln, or our c xcicl i*o»iti^a in uj« P«r«i«42 2ulf,ahw« ever lx&lt;m fereu^a fornftIX|r { 9 * ittXojnflLUy) to t)iO notice of llic OoTenarout of the belted Sta^oo of /ottorioa* Xd. if 8G,khtt UoubuX might himBelf rofreiin fra?* atteupt* i«a to terry on Oomiular work, or if he vert? to attempt to do vQ 9 mi&amp;it oe asked to doeist in virtue of etrr ^^roc'scntc with t^io Euler of rsohrain^whihod fcoett oc .^'jLnicjttctl to his G overuse at* X^** -i the position hae not been co;^aunic£ited to the durtwBaettt of the United of iiiaerioa.i think tdiat on tix first oo»#fc»ion # it mi^ht he »mfflatent (if the ConsuX were tw ahaw signs yf activity) for tsx foiltical to draw tlx Gaetattl'ft attention to the ocelueive A^araatatal of 139-1.

Sir, In paragraph 4 of my desnatch No.2 of 5th February 1932, regarding my visit to King Ibn Baud, I mentioned that among the subjects discussed was the possibility of some consular status being afforded to Nejdi representatives in Bahrain and Kuwait. 2 . I now have the honour to amplify somewhat the brief reference to this subject therein made. The question was raised by Yusuf Yasin in the course of one of our lengthy nightly discussions, and he began by asking me whether it would not be possible to accord some consular status to a Nejdi representative at Bahrain. I replied by saying that he knew how delicate was the position at Bahrain vis-^-vis the Persians, who had not yet abandoned their claim: that there was a very large Persian colony at Bahrain, and that if we allowed the Hejaz-Nejd G-overnment to have a consular representative the Persians would inevitably put forward a similar demand: in fact they had already made a request to this effect to which His Majesty 1 s Government had not acceded. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin admitted the force in this contention and did not press the matter any further in respect of Bahrain, but went on to ask whether it would not be oossible to give some sort of official status to Nafisi, Ibn Saud f s trade agent at Kuwait, since as far as he was aware there were no difficulties with the Persians at that place His Majesty T s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.r*' place* I replied that this was not altogether correct: the Persians did not claim Kuwait but did not recognise it and impounded Kuwaiti passports if brought to Persia, etc. It would, in my opinion, be extremely undesirable to allow the Persians to have a consular representative at 13 Kuwait for reasons which he would doubtless appreciate; but if any consular status was accorded to Nafisi we could hardly refuse a similar concession to the p ersians who had a large number of subjects in Kuwait. He saw the force of this argument and did not press the matter further. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty 1 s Minister at Jeddah and to the G-ovemment of India.

The Sheikh of Koweit in the Agreement of 23rd January, 1899 pledged 'Jiimself and his heirs and successors not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit . . . without the previous sanction of the British Government ...' This engagement still subsists. 3 The Colonial Office are anxious to know our views on the point raised by the proposal of the Iraq Government to appoint an Iraqi Vice-Consul at Koweit. I understand from them that tney have been in demi- official communication with the Foreign Office. The l j o j Foreign Office take (the view that, if we agree to an Iraq Consul or consular representation in Koweit, SVnW f rf~ there will be an£ equally reasonable demand for a Nejdi consular representative. This is not unlikely to be followed by a demand from the Persians that they also shall be represented there. The reactions on the position in Bahrein, where we are particularly anxious to avoid the presence of an official consular agent either of Ibn Sand or of the Persians, are obvious. The Colonial Office intimate demi-officially that they will not necessarily accept our view, should we strongly oppose the appointment of an Iraqi Consular officer, but I do not gather that they have themselves any very firm convictions on the point. It seems desirable to ask trie Government of India for their views, and possibly to give them a slight lead against.

Subject:-- Question of the protection to be afforded to Persian nationals in Kuwait. - Si av In reply to the telegram from His Majesty’s Secre tary of State for India, No. 12, dated the 2nd January 1926, I am directed to forward a copy of the marginally cited letter for information. 2 . The Government of India agree that the request of Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident ) in the Persian Gulf, No.lBO-S, dated 15th May 1926, with enclosures. the Persian Government for the good offices of the Politi cal Agent for their nationals in Kuwait cannot well be re t used. Indeed, an obligation to exercise them seems to flow from the responsibilities we have assumed under tre Kuwait Treaty of 1899. If exercised with discretion, as the Political Agent would be strictly enjoined to do, they should not in practice prove irksome to the Sheikh ox ..n,. i u. Mo rurther intimation 'to him would be necessary, ana if His Majesty’s Government agree 'the Political Agent wo'aid be simply instructed to take up each case as it arises. r $ T 3. At the same time the Government of India view the attituoe of the Sheikh with some sympathy, and they do not agree with the Resident that a spontaneous offer of good o ^ 1 1 ce^ oro ic 'e made to the Iraq Government. As to Rohr ain,Bahrain, seeing that both States ere 'Onder the control * of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf it would apparently he unnecessary in any case to make any formal arrangement.

Government of India i n the Fo ^ei gn ana Po 1 i ti cel Dep ar tme 10 1 , ErcMfiii qt^qI . i an. n&amp;H Kumil*. Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with endorsement from tne Govern.ent of India in the Foreign ana Political Department ho. 194 -N., dated the 25tli January 1926, regarding the request of the Persian Government that the Political Agent, Kuwait, should he authorised to render good offices to Persian nationals there. 2. Major More has been in constant communication with the Shaikh of Kuwait on this subject for the past four months, and has reported from time to time that the Shaikh has seemed to be on the point of acceding to the request of the P e r s i an Gove r n r n nt. At the 1 as t mo me nt however he has each time definitely changed his mind and refused to agree, of tew indeed going away to his estate on Failakah Island for a short spell to avoid further argument. 3. The tenor of the arguments wnich we nave employed is as follows: - - In 1908 (when Lorimer’s C-.zetteer cX t he^Parslsn Gul f was produced) there were only 1000 Persians earning theirtheir livelihood in Kuwait; now tine re are about 10,000. many P rsian sailing vessels also visit the port of Kuwait. The Persian Gov rr-'ent feel that their interests in Kuwait are of sufficient importance to call for official protection. The Pritish Legation ana Consuls in Persia give aid ana good offices to nationals of many States, such as Austria, Holland, Norway and Portugal. In 'huscst the British Consulate does similarly. In India certain foreign Consuls have charge of the interests of nationals of other States; for instance, the French Gonsul at Bombay locks after Belgian interests. A generation a o 0 , the el tiers between En^lana and Bahrain were similar to the relations between Ingland ana the Traci el Cl iefships; but into Bahrain there came nationals of other States, such as Americans, Germans and Frenchmen. When outrages we^e perpetrated or German and Persian subjects, the Govern'erts of both countries asked His Majesty’s Government to protect and obtain redness for their nationals. This had to he forcibly done, and the prestige and honour of the Shaikh of Bahrain were diminished because he would rot listen to the British representa tive. If a similar trouble should occur at Kuwait, would not His Majesty’s Government take the same line? Is not better that there should be a settleo understanding between Kuwait, Persia and Great Britain in the time of amity, so that all officials should fully understand their duties? His Majesty's Government do rot race unreasonable demands on behalf of their nationals ana proteges. It is not desired or contemplated that Persian subjects should he withdrawn from the jurisdiet'on of the Sheikh's Courts.(WJ Courts. Their cases will only he wetched hy the Political Agency in the State Courts and, if injustice appears likely to he done, a. direct reference will he made to the Shaikh himself. The Shaikh is really only asked to note the arrangement made between Great Britain and Persia and to acquiesce formally in it. he is not expected to object to a proposal which eliminates the possibility of political complications for Great Britain and which is inexpensive to Persia. If the Shaikh asks for a reciprocal arrangement, which will exceedingly benefit his subjects in Persia, it can hardly nefused. 4. The Shaikh’s final reply, addressed vo myself, is disappointing. A translation of it is enclosed. It shows how great an influence his reactionary Arab officials and advisees must wield over him. There is a suggestion in the Chief’s letter that, though he must not admit a Persian representative into Kuwait, he can correspond with that Government by letter regarding Persian interests. Is this to be concurred in? 5. Twenty years ago, when I was in Bahrain ana the Government of India were pressing upon Shaikh Isa the desirability of reforming his customs administration, the Chief used to say 'I do not like the prooosals ana will never voluntarily change my present system. If the Government of India issue an order to me, that is a different matter. I must obey!” I was told then that the matter dia not call for such a strong measure, and the reform was not inVucuced for many yerirs. It might, in the long run, have been better for Shaikh Isa if he had been given the order! 6 . All the Arab Chiefs of the Gulf fully recognize that they cannot maintain their indepemence against Najd, Iraq or Persia without protection from Great Britain. They must consequently be subordinate to a certain extent. If they receive an order from Hqs ale sty’sMajesty’s Goverr-ent they are hound tc obey it. 7. Before finally reporting to Government that the Shaikh was totally unreasonahle , -- and although I hac little hope that I could persuade him afte^ Major More had. failed -- I deemed it my duty to visit Kuwait rrys elf. I h av e just re tume d from the re. 8 . In the course Ox* a long conversation in which I remindea ti e Shaikh of the misfortunes which Shaikh I-a of Bahrain anc Shaikh Khazal of Mo ha me rah had brought upon themselves through ignoring the well-considered advice of His Majesty’s Government, I entertained hopes for a few moments that Shaikh Ahmad- would see reason. We got on to the question of how to recognize Persian subjects in Kuwait and Kuwait subjects in Persia and agreed that in both cases insistence should be enforced on the individuals possessing nrope^ passoorts from their own Governments. 9. The Shaikh then said 'My strongest reason for objecting to your proposal is th-t if I agree tc it, will not Iraqis, Bahrainis, Omanis, Najdis and others claim the seme benefit? If it is accorded to them. I » * shall be left with no subjects to rule over'! To this I felt constrained to reply 'If the Iraq and Bahrain Governments apply to His Majesty's Govern ment as Persia has done, I think that we must certainly accept their requests. As regards Najd, I am net certain that the Sultan will care to reciproca.te, and. at present we have no Political Officer attached to his Court.' I then beggec the Shaikh not to forget the great difference between 'jurisdiction over Muslims' and 'good offices to Muslims'. He reolied 'I fully understand, but I fear that in the future seme Political Agent will en croach on my rights.*'. Prom this conversation I am inclined w think that the Shaikh's real fear is that his power tc levy tares will be -r-estricted. 3. I then reminded the Shaikh that two cases affecting Kuwai tKuwait interests in Persia haa recently receivea attention from British Officers (i) a suit about landed nroperty in Abadan, and (2) a vessel which was wreched on the l^ekran Coast. It would be irr.pOv sible for us to intervene in such cases again if the ohai’ch did not get his relations with Persia put on to a satisfactory footing now. He ^eolied 'My interest in such cases is very small. I will not be influenced by it!' 9. I then told him that I cid not think that His Majesty's Foreign Office could possibly refuse the Persian request, ana I asked 'If I write to you shortly that this request has been made and agreed to, and ask you simply to take note of it, will you reply that you 50?' He Id 'Yc • , 1 will; ana I .a that 1 will not oppose it.' I causes him uo repeat this promise, smu then said that fundamentally this was all that I wanted from him. In the past the Poli- tical Agent unofficia 11 y had often, with his consent, rendered good offices to foreigners who applied for them. Henceforth his claim to do so could not be overlooked. 10 . After the Shaikh had taken his departure I pre pared a short letter, copy enclosed, which I handed tc him in. the afternoon. His reply reached me the next morning just bufo^e my embarkation on board H.M.3. 'TPIAD'. It will be seen from the translation attached that he has broken his word and has simply repeatea the protests which he had previously made. 11 . Major More went to him and asked him why he haa not written as he hso volunteerec to do. He replied 'I have carried out my promise. See the l$st sentence of my letter.' Major More tells me that this ending is a formal and not uncommon one. The Shaikh's answer s a frivolous quibble. 12. In these circumstances I think that the Shaikh'slast letter may be ignored. I recommend now Uiat the announcement, which I made to the Shaikh, may he regarded as irrevocable, and that it should be followed up, after a reference h‘S been made to the Governments of Iraq ano Bahrain, with announcements th‘t good offices will also be accorded to subjects of those States.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th April, in which you say that some months ago the Persian Government made a request to the British Government that the Political Agent should uncer- take the Consular charge of Persian interests in Kuwait, as they have many subjects residing and trading in Kuwait and also Persian vessels continually calling at Kuwait. You also give various explanations in this connection, which is certainly extremely kind of you to do. Yes, I know perfectly well that the British Government w ant nothing for their subjects ana proteges but welfare and justice, as is indeed an obvious fact. Regarding the Persian Government 1 s request, how ever, this is extremely difficult for me, ana I have sufficient confidence in the kindness of the British Government to believe that I will not be forced to accept this demand without any reason to call for my doing so. There are large numbers of Persians who have made their homes here, and I look on these as Kuwait people. Of course a Government has the right to look after its subjects' interests, and if it sees that my wrong or injustice has been done to its subjects, it has then the right to make a demand like this. However, this is a thirfl which, please God, will never happen, as my decisions and my methods of dealing with all people £re, I believe, known to you: I endeavour by the grace ofGod to give just decisions which are acceptable to all. If the Persians see anything done against trie rights of their subjects, they can represent any such cases and have them inquired into through any one they like. It is my earnest hope that you will agree with this and accept it, as, please God, I am a true and sincere friend of trie British Government in both word and deed. As you know I comolied with the wishes of trie British Government in delegating to the Political Agent my jurisdiction over the subjects of the British Government and of non-Muslim Foreign Powers. I did not hesitate to comply with the wishes of His Majesty's Government in that case, in the hope that I would please them. After this agreement it v as confirmed and given out that peases relating to the subjects of Muslim Powers would be dealt with by me, that is to say including Persians. This was only a short time ago. Consequently the Persian Government’s request is in opposition to my hope. I pray therefore that the British Government will be so kind as to help me, who am their true friend, and will persuade the Persian Govern ment in any way you think best.

No. 333.) Your telegram No. 90 to Foreign Office. Persians in Koweit. Possession of passports by foreigners in Koweit is not obligatory under Koweit law. I think that Persians who want passports should apply individually to Bushire or Mohammerah for them on the ground that their own country requires her subjects to take passports when going abroad. It is essential that statements about themselves should be verified in Persia. Appointment of Honorary Consul to make facilities in other matters is surely contrarycontrary to intention of our agreement of 1899 with Sheikh. If request is granted we shall doubtless have a similar one made with reference to Trucial Oman Chiefs. Koweit subjects who proceed to Persia take certi ficates of identification from British Political Agent. These are treated in Persian ports as Foreign passports and are taxed 25 krans for visa.In any further communication on this subject, please quote and No - &lt;£ £ rtf //* 3 6 /s address— ' not to any person by name, fjc vjJl ^/ 2 5 ^2 but “ The Under-Secretary of State,’ Foreign Office, Ixmdon, S.W.

Persian Consul at Basrah has written to the Political Agent at Koweit that he is sending representative to issue passports to Persian subjects residing at K 0 Assistance of the P„Ac is solicitedo Under our agreement, January, 1899, with the Sheikh, this cannot be permitted without previous sanction of His Majesty's Government, I recoruaend that the Sheikh be informed that Persian official may visit Koweit for fifteen days, for this specific work only* Fresh p, arrivals in K&lt;&gt; will probably possess passportso Perhaps Persian Government should be infomed, and invited to recognise Koweit papers of nationality in Persia. fiacUu We endorse proposal for fifteen days'visit. There seem distinct advantages in accepting this Persian request, as it implies recognition of the status quo at Koweit to involve in itself recognition of Koweit papers of nationality,, Whether the Persian Goverment should be officially informed, the Minister perhaps will be the best Judge.
