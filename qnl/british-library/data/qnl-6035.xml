The matter was not mentioned in our letter to the Baghdad Embassy under reference. We can wait until we hear further from the Baghdad Embassy on the sub ject, but meanwhile, I should be grateful if you could let me know what status is enjoyed by the Saudi Arabian Trade Agent at Kuwait. I believe he is entirely unofficial and that he does not fly a flag but presumably his appointment was made with the concurrence of the Shaikh.&amp; JON 7IDENTIAL. PIS PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAH RUN. 1st April, 1949 149/16/49 Desr Chancer; , Please refer to your letter 50/1/49 of the 8th January regarding customs and passport affairs in Kuwait. 2. In view of your saving telegram No. 5 of the 11th February we proposed to drop the matter since Izzat Jaffar visited Iraq a year and a half ago. 3. The Political Agent, Kuwait, reports that he has no knowledge of any particular difficulties existing between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi authorities concerning customs and passports and the Sheikh has not raised this subject. If the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign affairs wish to pursue the matter, we would suggest that, if you see no objection, they should raise the matter to you officially and later it might be discussed on a diplomatic basis between the Political Agent, Kuwait and properly appointed Iraqi delegates who should not approach the Kuwait authorities direct.

BRITISH EMBASSY, 3A0K3A0. 8th January, 1949. Dear Hesidency, ./e have recently/ been asked by 'ohe Director- Oeneral of the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs for our opinion on the following two matters. i1 he Secretary of the Sheikh of Kuwait, who has apparently been here to discuss various difficulties over customs, passports etc., has suggested that the Iraqi authorities should send a number of officials to talK things over in Kuwait. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs tola him that they would consult us first but in conversation with us said that they had no doubt that the Kuwaiti authorities had already discussed this with the Polioical Agent in Kuwait. The people most likely to go from here are the Tirector-CJ-eneral of Customs and one or more representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry also understand that Saudi Arabia maintains an Agent in Kuwait. They want to maintain an officer of 'ohe same status and designation there. Me made no comments and said that we would let the Director-Ceneral know our views in due course. We should therefore be grateful for your urgent comments on both questions.■ •&gt; ( J- ° J '1*0 • ' i - W 9^\I\08 c i-iu'-afE t -;or:9i • 3 *1 ••&gt;C - r £OJ 09 r IXv 91 ' XiJO 1C &gt;11 nsao vijn8oa f i 9 i to YiJ 3 int-i ip si! 6 iicr to laiansi) . .

The father and grandfather of the present to you H.E.Sir Rupert Hay,KCIE. f CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.(E 6995/1903/91) CQNEIDEftTlAL FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 14th September, 19^9. Dear Humphrey, Will you please refer to your letter No.852/2/49 of the 18th July about the establishment of an Iraqi Consulate in Kuwait? We discussed this matter with Sir Rupert Hay and we agree with you that if the Americans are allowed to establish a Consulate in Kuwait (see my letter No.E.9325 to Tehran, which is being copied to you) we will find it difficult to resist the Iraqi desire to do likev/ise, particularly as they are a limitrophe country and have now withdrawn the power of the Political Agent, Kuwait, to issue visas for Iraq. We also agree that once we deciae to change our policy in this matter there is little to be gained except ill-v/ill in stalling indefinitely with the Iraqis. We have thought of sug 6 estin^ to the Iraqis that they should appoint in the first instance, only a Trade Agent with power to issue visas which would be in line with our decision to permit the Indians and Pakistanis to appoint Trade Agents at Bahrain, though, of course, ti conflicts with our acceptance, on conditions of the Americars wish to have a Consul. The Americans, however, have not yet signified their agreement to our approaching the Shaikh on the conditions laid down by us and it may be some time before the matter is settled. For the moment, therefore, there is nothing which can be said to the Iraqis. If they speak again, you can only say that the matter is being considered. The same goes for the Iraqi request for a Consul at Bahrain. (Your despatch No.153 (852/11/49) of 10th August). Even if the iunerican proposal goes through, I think the first step in any case would be for us to ask Hay to sound the Shaikh of Kuwait unofficially aoout an appointment for the Iraqis. We believe him to be generally willing to exaltjhis own authority and seeming independence of us by receiving representatives of forcing powers, but he may well be less anxious to welcome the representatives of foreign powers other than the United States then he may be to welcome an American representative. . He may also be both sensitive about Iraqi designs on Kuwait and resentful of the recent decision about his date'gard,ens, though his appeal is yet to be heard. It would be politic, therefore, to seek the Shaikh^ views first. But it will not be possible for Hay to sound the Shaikh about an appointment for the Iraqis until he can speak about the Americans when and if they agree to our conditions. I am sending copies of this letter to Bahrain, Jedaa, and Tehran. Yours ever, SD/fi- B.A.B. BURROWS. H. Trevelyan, Esq., C.I.E. , O.B.
