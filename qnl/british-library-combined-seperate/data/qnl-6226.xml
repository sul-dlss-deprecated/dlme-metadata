The foliation sequence does not include the front and back covers, nor does it include the leading and ending flyleaves.An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 100-160; these numbers are also written in pencil or crayon, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume comprises parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of 8. It concerns British land policy in the occupied territories of Mesopotamia [Iraq], particularly in relation to the sale, leasing or granting of land in the occupied territories to persons or companies that are not domiciled inhabitants of the territories; also covered are proposed acquisitions of land in Mesopotamia by the British authorities, for both civil and military purposes. Much of the correspondence discusses Ottoman law, international law, and regulations or restrictions imposed by the British authorities themselves, in relation to land transfer in Mesopotamia.The French language material consists of one enclosure that accompanies an item of correspondence in part 8 of the volume.Also included with the volume are several maps and plans depicting areas or sites discussed in the correspondence.Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Land tenure</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0002e5#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0002e5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0002e5#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0002e5#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0002e5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0002e5#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
