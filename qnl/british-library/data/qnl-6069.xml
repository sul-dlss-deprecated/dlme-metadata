OIL COM CESSION S 1M KUWAIT MUUTRAJL ZONE AMD JM.W.KBJAZ. I a^ain received Huse^m al Awayni at his request this morrinf!;. He leaves tonorrov? for Rgypt and Byria. He will belach next month, perhaps with udlibi, who^n he houes to meet in . In the course of conversation Awayni made the following statement a 1. The Standard Oil of California have officially asked the Cayd i Government about the position between them and the Arabian Development Syndicate. The Goverment have put them off by saying that nothing has been settled. 2. Awayni wished to set the Government to agree to his general proposals before discusring pecuniary terms. He has, however, made his proposals under this head unoffi ciallyo They are (aj to ray a sum down of £ 15,000 (not a loan) to the joint Rulers for the grant of the Neutral Zone concession; (b) to pay £ 5000 a year rent until commercial exploitation is possible; (c^ to pay thereafter 4/- a ton Royalty. The Saudi Arab tioverment want £ 15,000 down for their own share of the payment at (a). Awayni thinks that they would take £ 10,000. 3. The clause in the secret agreement between the Saudi fljOTFArab Government and Standard Oil of California giving a right of preference on equal tenns in regard to -bn Saul’s right in the Heut ral Zone provides for a penalty of £ 30,000 to be paid by the Saudi Arab Government in the event of the concession, as regards Ibn Sand’s share,/share, heing giyen over the heads of Standard Oil of Cal if or ni a. 4 0 'fhe King is detemined by hook or crook to get out of any comnitnent to the Standard Oil of California and has instructed his Cox^erment to do the necessary to this endo Awayni outlines the following possible evolution:- Saudi Arab Covernnent come to terms with Xdlibio Saudi Arab Government then 6ffer the concession on these terms, so far as their interest is concerned, to Standard Oil of California. Standard Oil of California agree and Saudi Arab Government then slay that it is up to Standard Oil of California to square the Shaikh of Kuwait and/or His Majesty’s Government. Standard Oil of California fail in this. Saudi Arab Government then say, rt We have fulfilled our obi igatior . We are now free unless you pay us the lump sum (say £ 10,000) that you agreed to pay”. ^andard Oil of California would be unable to pay on this scale for an ineffective ioncession and would thus be eliminated. 5. The Standard Oil of California have 20 + permission to send a geologist to the Yanbu’-Muwaya area, subject to his report being communicated to the Saudi Arab Govern ment. Awayni has had a promise that this report will be passed on to his groun. 6. In both cases the King wants to have nothing *0 do with any but genuinely British interest a. Major Holmes is to have nothing to do with the business. -ihe Shaikh of Kuwai 4 - made this a condition, when the Syndicate sounded him about the -Neutral Zone. Awayni has given an official undertaking to the Saudi Arab Government that Holmes will in no way be concerned, I discussed the whole subject enough to elucidate the above points and 1 do not think ^ have gone materially wrong/3 -3- wronfr in ny attempt to reproduce them in nrecano ^orm. I avoided aa far as ■oossibliy anjr conment on the position of the Saudi Arab Governraent, beyond su^yesting that * here might he a case for arbitration under head 4, as the Saudi Arab Government and the Standard Oil of California had apparently not provided for the contingency of the Shaikh of Kuwait refusing to have anythin/? + o do with Standard On 0 f California. 1 put a direct question regarding Major Holmes. For the rest, 1 said that any question in regard to the Shaikh of Kuwait’s in + erest was entirely outside mv province, both in principle and in actual fact as the matter was far too delicate for me to mix up in it. The only advice X would give was that Awayni’s principle shouid ascertain the viewsof His Majesty’s Gov ~ rnrn en t in Lo ndo n. Awayni again snoke of Mr 6 i£hilby as working with the Americans, but more casually than when he last came to see me. AHDHEW RYAN f’/ r5 /34 -15th Fi^BxflJAaY. TO DISCUSS THu OJ^SIION Off Tffi GRANT OP OIL CONCESSIONS IN THE KQhhIT NhUTBAL Z0N5 , Present; - Sir Louis Kershaw (in the Chair) Mr. G.W. Renael ) Mr. C.P*A. Vi/amer) Foreign Office Petroleum Department Admiralty Lit. F.C. Starling Ivir • iu. A * oQ a 1 Mr. J#C# Walton Lit. J.G. Laithwaite te. G.I. Cromhie India Office sir Louis Kershaw said that if it had not heen for the practical difficulties there was a general feeling in favour of the suggestion that the Koweit Neutral Zone should he ”sterilised” in so far as oil concessions were concernea. Mr. Pend el explained that '’sterilisation” had heen suggested in the first instance he thought hy himself because of the very great difficulties which would arise, in the event of any concession being granted, in regard to jurisdiction over and protection of employees of the oil company, the maintenance of law and order, etc. in a territory in which Ibn 3aud and the Sheikh of Koweit had equal rights. It would be very difficult for H.M.G. to get any effective safeguards in respect of the Neutral Zone but on the other hand they coula not divest themselves of all responsibility in the event of a concession being granted. Mr« La ith waite said that before H.M.G. agreed to the errant of a concession in so far as the Sheikh of Koweit was concerned it would be necessary to insist on some prior agreement with Ibn Saud on tne question of jurisdiction, K&gt;PY sent by air MAU, protection/0 2 protection, etc., in the Neutral Zone. Sir Louis Kershaw saiu that if oil concessions were developed in Rasa and Koweit it would he extremely difficult to resist indefinitely the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone if doth Ihn Saua and the Sheikh, as seemed prohahle, were in favour of it. The meeting agreed and turned to the consideration of the competitors for a concession who had already appeared in the field. These seemed to he: (1) The Arabian Oil Development .s^haicate represented hy Yalibi and/Group, in which Mr. Janson of the Eastern and General Syndicate had a considerable interest, (2) The Iraq petroleum Company, and (3) Ihe Standard Oil Company of California. Ivm. Starling explained that since the Neutral Zone was within the red line of the Iraq Petroleum Company, the Koweit Oil Company, in which the A*P.0,C. and the Gulf Oil Corporation each had a 50% interest, would be unable to compete for a concession independently of the Iraq Petroleum Company. Sir Louis Kershaw said that it was presumably politically most undesirable that the standard Oil should obtain the concession, Mils Bend el agreed. He said that as far as could be gathered from the information at the disposal of the roreign Office (Jedda telegram No.20 of 9th February) Ibn Saud had already given the Standard Oil Company of California an option on a concession in the Neutral Zone. Tne position now appeared to be that the Arabian Oil Development Syndicate, to whom Ibn Saud had also given some encouragement, hoped to bt; able to got round this option by getting the sheikh of Koweit to refuse to let the/5 the Standard Oil get a concession in the Zone. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that perhaps the position was rather that Ibn Saud merely wanted some other competitor in order to bid up the Standard Oil* He asked what the preference granted to the Standard Oil really amounted to, and suggested that they had merely been offered a preference in the event of other considerations being equal. That meant that in spite of the penalty provision in Ibn Saud ! s agreement with the Standard Oil, to take effect if some other Company obtained a concession, the concession would in fact be given to the Company which offered the best terms. Mr. Bendel . agreed that, other things being equal, Ibn Saud would perhaps prefer that the concession should go to the Standard Oil, and Mr. Warner suggested that it was merely politeness on the part of the King when he said that he would rather give the concession to a British company.. Sir Louis Kershaw said that on the whole if we could .arrange things so that a party acceptable to obtained a concession it was perhaps better in the long run to aim at this than at sterilisation, Mr, Warner said that whoever got a concession it would be necessary in view of the joint sovereignty of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh over the Neutral Zone, to reach some definite agreement with Ibn Saud for carrying out unified measures of control, protection, etc., on behalf of both rulers, \ Mr. haithwaite pointed out that if the Americans got the concession the result would be that Ibn Saudis interest in the Neutral Zone would tend to increase, while/4 ~ while similarly the Sheikh’s interest would be increased if the concession went to a British company. The question was thus one of active political importance to us. Mr. Bendel said that it had been suggested that His Majesty’s G-overnment might escape responsibility by informing any Company which competed for a concession that they would have to work the concession at their own risk* He did not think such a course offered a real solution. If United States employees of the Company were attacked by beduin raiders, His Majesty’s Government would in practice either have to intervene themselves or agree to the United States Government doing so. It would be impossible in practice if an outrage occurred for His Majesty’s G-overnment to justify inaction by saying that the Company had already been warned. Ir„. Laithwaitc said that there seemed to be only two British companies whom His Majesty’s (Government might support in getting a concession, the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Arabian Oil Development Syndicate. It seemed almost certain that the latter were merely concession hunters and would not work any concession themselves. Sir.. Louis Kershaw disliked the idea of the concession being obtained by concession hunters like the Arabian Oil Development Syndicate, and it was agreed that His Majesty’s (Government should have as little to do with the Syndicate as possible. Mr.Laithwaite suggested that if we wanted the Iraq Petroleum Company to get the concession there were two alternatives. In the first place we might at once inform the Iraq Petroleum Company that we would support them if they/~ 5 ~ thoy competed for a concession; or, alternatively, we might offer our support to Ydlibi and his group, on condition only that they transferred any concession to the Iraq Petroleum Company. MjLx —Winner thought that Ibn Sand was not seriously thinking of granting a concession to the Ydlibi group who were not a syndicate with any real backing, and that he had merely entered into negotiations with them because he wished to get off a debt which he owed to Ydlibi* He suggested that His Majesty's G-overnmont might say to Ibn Saud that, in view of the position of divided sovereignty in the Koweit Neutral Zone, it would not be practicable for any oil concession to be granted in that area until the King and the Sheikh had reached some agreement on the question of protection and control. Bendel suggested that this would amount to a kind of provisional sterilisation and Sir Louis Kershaw pointed out that, it might... let the Americans in, and defeat our purpose,.which was that the concession should if possible, go to a British company. Mr..*. Rondo 4 , thought that His Majesty's G-overnment might be able to use the power of veto which they possessed in virtue of their agreements with the Sheikh to secure, the acceptance by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of suitable conditions regarding protection, jurisdiction etc., and to ensure that the concession was granted to a suitable company* Jr, y Wftltgn said that it was desirable to make some approach to the Iraq Petroleum Company in the matter as soon as possible, and Mr^ Lai thwaite suggested that in raising the question with the Iraq Petroleum Company who were/~ 6 ~ were known to be actively interested we should as a condition of our active support with Ibn Baud and the Sheikh get them to agree to our conditions in regard to British control, safeguards, etc. YJc could then advise Ibn Saud against negotiating a concession with Ydlibi and make an offer to the Xing to advise the Sheikh to agree ■■a ■■conco^sioj^'-^th Iftili^ri caao-mike-an offer te ^tro King ta'-ftdviao-th-e--Shuikh-'ktr^e-groe to a concession in the Neutral Zone, in return for a satisfactory agreement with Ibn Saud on the question of jurisdiction and control, and on condition that he agreed to the grant of the poncession to the Iraq Petroleum Company, Mr. Rondel suggested that the raising of the Koweit blockade by Ibn Saud might also be made a condition of His Majesty ! s Government advising the Sheikh to agree to a concession, but Sir Loui skiers haw thought that this condition would prejudice the chances of an agreement in regard to oil, Mr, Starling said that for historical reasons the Iraq Petroleum Company could be relied upon to oppose very vigorously the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone to the Standard Oil Company of California* The Iraq Petroleum Company were a very wealthy concern and, if they made up their minds to get a concession the question of money would not be the same consideration to them as it would be for instance to the A,P,0*C* Sir Louis farsfraw said that the meeting was agreed that the Idlibi Syndicate could be left out of account so far as the support of His Majesty’s Government was concerned* The/h ~ 7 ~ The first thing to do was to get the Iraq Petroleum Company K) to agree to conditions more or less the same as those which were proposed for Qatar, in exchange for which His Majesty's Grovernment would offer to use their influence with the Sheikh of Koweit and Ion Saud in favour of the Company* Mr* Handel suggested that if the Iraq Petroleum Company were successful in getting a concession, they might in practice lease it out to the Koweit Oil Company and thus utilise the latter's organisation and avoid a duplication of staff and machinery. M r , * , sta r l ing said that it was net true, as Mr. Janson had recently alleged at an interview at the Department of Overseas Trade, that Major Holmes had had conversations about this matter on behalf of the Syndicate with Mr, Fraser of the Iraq Petroleum Company. Mr*. laithwaite explained that Major Holmes had himself admitted to him in a recent interview, the record of which had been circulated, that the conversations referred to had taken place last year when the position in regard to the Neutral Zone was much more indefinite but that Mr. Fraser had refused to have anything to do with him when ho (Major Holmes) had recently approached him by letter on the subject. Mr. Starling said that he was confident that the Iraq Petroleum Company would certainly avoid having any relations with the Eastern and General Syndicate or the Ydlibi Group in regard to a concession in the Neutral Zone, and he was sure that if Mr. Fraser were told that sterilisation, which the Iraq Petroleum Company had been inclined to favour, was impracticable, the Iraq Petroleum Company would be ready at once to become a competitor for a concession. There need not/not be any delay about this since he understood that Mr. Fraser had already received instructions from the Board of the Iraq Petroleum Company to compete for a concession, if any concession were to be granted in the area. The conclusions of the meeting may be summarised as follows :~ (a) that sterilisation, while desirable in principle, was impraeticable; (b) that on this assumption it was desirable to secure the Neutral Zone concession for a British company or a company with a substantial British element, ana that there would be strong objection to the concession being secured by the Standard Oil of California. (c) that the Iraq Petroleum Company, which was definitely interested in the area, was the only Company with a British element which appeared likely to be able to take it up* (d) that it was undesirable to support the Arabian Development Syndicate, particularly in view of their relations with the Eastern and General Syndicate; (e) that an immediate informal approach should be made to the Iraq Petroleum Company by the India Oifice, with a view to explaining frankly the official attitude in regard to- the situation and intimating that subject to their meeting us over the terms of any agreement as regards control and safeguards, we would support them both with I bn SvOid and with tne (f) that subject to a sa Sheikh of Koweit. tisfactory response the Iraq Petroleum Company, Sir A. By an, to whom no interim reply/reply need be sent, should be instructed to inform Ibn Scud that we did not recommend the Arabian Development Syndicate; that we appreciated however his anxiety for British exploitation and understood that the Iraq Petroleum Company whom we could recommend, wished to apply; that any concession would, as he would agree, raise questions of jurisdiction and protection which ~ ■ i - would have to be settled between us and that it would be necessary to reach an understanding on this as a preliminary to our allowing the Sheikh of Koweit to concur in any concession; but that, subject to this, we would, if proposals satisfactory to Don Baud and the Sheikh were submitted by the Iraq Petroleum Company, be prepared to advise the Sheikh to grant a concession to them.t Forwarded with the ompliments of the Secretary, Political epartment, India Office. or ndia Office Whitehall London opy sent to Hi-k ^ ;ia (S An informal discussion took place at the India Office on the 1st March with representatives of the Anglo Persian Oil Company about oil in the Koweit neutral ' zone.

Laithwaite ) ) Mr. G.E, C rombie ) In the Chair Foreign Office Pe t r o le urn D e partme nt Admiralty India Office Mr. Fraser ) ) A.P.O.C. Mr. He am ) The discussion may he summarised as follows:- Mr. Fraser said that since sterilisation was apparently i mpr ac t i c ah 1 e the I. P. C. we re e age r t o compe te for a concession in the neutral zone and that the A.P.O.C., who had authority to act on behalf of the I.P.C. in regard to a concession in the neutral zone, were ready to consider at once what steps could best be taken to secure a concession. It was pointed out to him that in the event of the I.P.C. securing the concession His Majesty f s Government would require very stringent safeguards in view of the peculiarly difficult situation in the neutral zone. Mr. Fraser said that so far as the A.P.O.C. were concerned, they would he thought be willing to meet the wishes of H.M.G. on this point in a reasonable way. He hinted however that there might be difficulties in this connection with the French element in the I.P.C. but said that/would c.o all that they could to overcome that the A.P.O.G. any such difficulties with With regard to the by the A.P.O.G., three line the French element. immediate steps to be taken s of approach appeared to be open to the Company^ (a) The A.P.O.G. might themselves negotiate for a concession with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kowe it on behalf of the I.P.C. (b) Tney might make use of Ydlibi and the Arabian Development Syndicate as agents in securing a concession. (c) They might just possibly be able to .reach some sort of understanding with the Standard Oil Company of California under which the Standard Oil Company might agree to leave the I.P.C. a clear field in the neutral zone. With regard to (a) and (b), Mr. Fraser explained that the A.P.O.C. would not even have considered the possibility of using Ydlibi and the Arabian Development Syndicate as agents had it not been for the A.P.O.C. l s lack of success with Ibn Saud in previous oil negotiations. They were extremely suspicious about the standing of Ydlibi and the Syndicate and their previous relations with the Eastern and General Syndicate, who were intimately connected with trie Arabian Syndicate, and with Major Holmes, were not such as to inspire them with Confidence. .They were therefore very apprehensive about using the Syndicate as agents and thus making themselves responsible in any way for any action which might be taken by the latter in their negotiations with Ibn Saud or the Sheikh. The A.P.O.C.IS tC 3, had hitherto declined to have any dealings with the Eastern and General or Arabian Development Syndicates and had refused to allow them to consider themselves as their agents in any way. Mr. Eraser knew however, that Major Holmes was anxious to discuss with him the possibility of the Arabian Development Syndicate securing a concession in the neutral zone on behalf of the I.P.G. Ydlibi claimed to be able to exercise influence on Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of oil concessions, but they had no reliable information as to how far Ydlibi could be trusted. It was known, of course, that Major Holmes himself was not person a grata with Ibn Saud. With regard to(c), Mr. Moffat, who used to be Vice President of the Standard Oil of Hew Jersey but had had to leave that Company, apparently on account of difficulties connected with internal American politics, and had now become Vice President of the Standard Oil Company of California, was at present in London. Mr. Fraser knew that he wanted to have a discussion with him about Bahrein oil. The Standard Oil of California were in difficulties in regard to their Bahrein concession since they had up to now been unable to arrange fo r the marketing and refining of the oil. They appeared to have received some sort of option from Ibn Saud on a concession in the netural zone but Mr. Eraser hinted at the possibility of being able to reach some sort of understanding with them as a result of which they might possibly agree to withdraw from the neutral zone and leave the I.P.C. a clear field in return for concessions made to them in other quarters. At any rate Mr. Eraser hoped to be able to obtain from Mr. Moffat some information about the intentions of the Standard Oil of California in the neutral zone and he believed that he could trust any information which Mr. Moffat gave him. Mr. /4. / ^ )A Mr. Fraser was quite emphatic that any understanding with the Standard Oil of California would not involve the participation of any further American element with the I.B.C. in developing a concession in the netural zone. It was pointed out to Mr. Fraser on behalf of the Foreign Office that if the Standard Oil Company of California did compete for a concession in the neutral zone and if it offered to Ibn Saud and the Sheikh much more favourable terms than the I.P.C. it would be extremely difficult for His Majesty’s Government to support the I.P.C. in obtaining a concession. Mr. Fraser recognised this but did not think that this difficult:/ would arise since the I.P.C. would be ready to pay a good deal to prevent the Standard Oil of California from obtaining a concession in the Neutral Zone. his and It was agreed that Mr. Fraser should proceed with enquiries as to the steps to be taken by the A.P.O.C. that meanwhile no action could, be taken by H.M.G.,i£AC/;j4. scsa. l Aamiraity, . .1. 5th March, 19^4. 0383/34. i, . *1 'y dear Laithweite, : r y I refer to India Office letter P.3.1199/34 tiated the 34th ebruary enclosing a copy of the record of the aeeting held on the 15th February to discuss oil in the owei t Ifeatral /one. i‘he Admiralty concur in the course of action agreeu upon at the meeting* They wirh, however, to bring two points to the notice of the India Office*- The first is in connection with safeguards* Cir Louis ershaw has, as you enow, already informed the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that a very tight Government agreement would be necessary and it is perhaps therefore unnecessary to say that the Admiralty would attach fully as such importance to provision for a refinery and for pre-emption in the ■oweit Neutral Lone as elsewhere in the Persian Gulf* The second point is the protection of the oil company f s personnel in the Neutral Lone - a question which was not dealt with at the meeting* Tie clearly cannot leave them unprotected; and it would be very unsatisfactory to leave protection to Ibn Baud, since tais would greatly strengthen his hold over the Neutral 4one* It would also be impracticable to collaborate with him - a solution which might otherwise seen to be t e natural consequence of a regime which really amounts to a Condominium* The only practicable possibility, therefore, is for the British Government to assume ithwaite. responsibility/ India Office Hresponsibility for the protection of Luropean personnel, an arrangement to which it woula no doubt be difficult to get Ibn aud to agree, since he is as jealous as the Sheikh of his position in the fleutral Some. The grant of a concession in the Neutral u&gt;ne would therefore represent an additional defence commitment, albeit a commitment which cannot b® avoided since sterilisation is not a practicable policy. In these circumstances the Admiralty would suggest that the whole question of protection shoulu be gone into fully at an early stage, bearing in mind that the Chiefs of Staff in their report about atar suggested that the question should be referred to the Copies of this letter have been sent to darner and Starling.

S.W.l Sir In your despatch No.72 (176/2/34) of the 13th February Tour Excellency reported an enquiry made by the United States Embassy at Angora regarding the Anglo Turkish Convention of the 29th July 1913. This enquiry may prove of considerable importance, since there is reason to believe that the interest which it reveals on the part of the United ^ States Government in the question of boundaries in Eastern Arabia is in all probability connected with the activities i of United States oil interests in that area. As you are no doubt aware, in July, 1933, the Standard Oil Company of California obtained from King Ibn Saud an oil concession covering the eastern part of his dominions. To the north the limits of this concession are co-terminous with the frontiers between Saudi Arabia, on the on© hand and Iraq and the independent Arab principality of Koweit, on the other. These frontiers are now laid down in certain agreements referred to in paragraph 4 below, but the position in the south and south east is, however, less simple. 2. On the 29th July 1913, His Majesty’s Government concluded with the Ottoman Government a convention defining the south eastern boundary of Turkish Arabia^from the coast of the Persian Gulf as far as the twentieth parallel of latitude. A second Convention concluded on the 9th March 19X4, continued the definition of this boundary between this point and the already delimited frontier between the Vilayet of/ Excellency The Et.Honourable Sir Percy Loraine, Bart., K. K.C.M.G., etc., etc., etc., Angora.(^6 ) i &lt;r&gt;' R &gt; &gt; ^ 2 . ' ^ of the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate. Copies of the 1913 Convention are enclosed in this despatch: the text of the 1914 Convention will be found on pages 42 and 43 of the 1933 edition of volume XI of Aitchison’s ’’Treaties, Engagements and banads n , a copy of which is, I understand in the library of His Majesty’s Embassy. The first of these Conventions was never ratified, but the boundary line laid down in Article 11 thereof was definitely adopted by Article 3 of the second Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on the bra June, 1914. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have not had occasion to discuss with King Ion Saud, since he acquired independent sovereignty over ivejd and the Hasa Coast, the question of the precise boundary between his dominions and those of the Arab rulers in the Persian Guli, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government although Ibn Saud has, by article 6 of the Ireaty of Jedda of the 20th May 192? formally recognised those special relations and undertaken to maintain friendly relations with the rulers concerned. But the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of the 1913/14 line have now oecome independent States, cannot be regarded in the view of -nis Majesty’s Government as in any way affecting the status of uhe territories on the other side of that line, which were then and still remain under British influence. Eis Majesty’s Government therefore still regard the 1913/14 line as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Succession State of Saudi Arabia and the territories of south ©astern Arabia with which they are in special relations. 3. Having regard to the presence of United States oil interests in this area it is important that the United States Government should be under no misapprehension on this point. It is desirable therefore that they should receive as full an account as possible of the position of His Majesty’s Government3 in this matter without delay, and should not he left to obtain possibly misleading information from the Turkish or Saudi Arabian Governments. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will arrange, as soon as possible for the United States Embassy at Angora (a) to be furnished with a copy of The Anglo Turkish Convention of the 29th July 1913, ad (b) to be shown the text of The Anglo Turkish Convention of the 9th March 1914 (Aitchison, volume XI (1933) pages 42 onwards). It should be pointed out to the United States Embassy that, while the 1913 convention is unratified, the boundary laid down in Article 11 is mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted in Article 3 of the ratified convention of 1914, which in the view of His Majesty’s Government remains operative. Further, since Article 7 of the 1913 Convention cfcn&amp;ains provisions regarding the frontier of Koweit, it would be well that the attention of the United States Embassy should also be drawn to (c) the Kuwait-Hejd Boundary Convention of the 2nd December, 1922 (Aitchison volume XI (1933) pages 213-4). . 4 y&gt;«» Vi* Finally since in connexion with the California Standard Oil Company!s concession it may be of interest to the United States Government to have the exact documentary definition of the Iraq-XTejd frontier, the United States Embassy should also be shown the text of (d) Protocol Ho.l between Iraq and Uejd, signed at Uqair on the 2nd December 1922. (Aitchison volume XI (1933) pages 211-2). 4. The United States Embassy may be given copies of any of the above texts which they may require and should be informed that Aitohison’s ’’Treaties’ 1 is purchasable, if they or the State Department should require a copy. 5. There is, however, one point arising out of the question of this frontier which needs special attention. I enclose, for your own confidential information and guidance, copies of telegraphic correspondence between the India Office and/4 and the GoYernment of India from which you will see that, although His Majesty’s GoYernment are satisfied as to the legal validity of the 1913/14 frontier as marking the eastern boundary on Ibn Baud’s dominions, some difficulty may possibly arise in maintaining that the territory immediately to the east of that line still forms part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Q,atar. This point is receiving further consideration; and meanwhile, should you find it necessary to give the United States Embassy any oral explanations on the matter, you should, notwithstanding the fact that the 1913 convention specifically describes the blue line as dividing Uejd from n the territory n of Qatar” avoid referring to the territory to the east of the blue line as specifically forming part of the State of Qatar itself, but refer to it merely as being under British influence* 6.

Koweit Oil Company could not hold concession themselves as neutral zone falls within sphere of I.P.C. for which they could therefore only act as agents, 2. I.P.C. are now inclined to consider that to ~ 11 enter field as third competitor for concession at this stage would merely result in raising the price. They are therefore trying to ascertain on Y/hat terms Arabian Development Syndicate would be prepared to act for them.

POLITICAL AGMCY, Dated the 12th April 1934 KUWAIT Prom Lt,-Colonel H,R.F,Dickson, C # I,E,, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwaiti To The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bus hir e Kuwait-Ne.jd Boundary Convention of 1922 Sir - * I have the honour to report that in reading Mr.Kendal’s despatch No.125 (N.1839/1206/91) dated Foreign Office, the 22nd March 1934, (page 3 line 18) I had occasion to look up the ’’Kuwait Boundary Convention of 192 2” as given on pages 213 and 214 of Aitchison Vol.XI(1929) in my possessioi 2. To my surprise, I found that in line 9 . the western boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone is described as ” 8 low mountainous ridge called Shag (Esh Shakk)” . 3. This is an entirely erroneous description of this interesting natural feature and unless corrected now, may give rise to endless trouble later when Oil or other boundary questions come up for discussion or settlement. 4. In actual fact what is described as ” a low mountainoi ri dge” t can by no stretch of the imagination be considered a ridge or rise in the ground at all, seeing that it is a wide shallow depression or valley , varying in width from 1 mile to 6 miles, according to its position. 5. The depression in question, if the 1-1,000,000 Sheet Map, referred to in the Convention is examined, is obviously not a ridge or rarge of hills, and I can only think that the mistake arose owing to the fact that Colonel More, D.u.0., the then Political Agent, Kuwait who was present at the Ojair Conference of December 1922 and signed the agreement on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait on 2nd December (the Shaikh signed atsigned at a later date in Kuwait) was unfaniliar with the geography of the Neutral Zone and the 'Shaq' depression. 6# I personally have, on at least twenty occasions, travelled over the whole length of the 'Shaq” valley, and am also entirely familiar with the Kuwait Neutral Zone, and that portion of Saudi Arabia territory lying immediately to the West and South of same. I therefore speak with authority, when I say that the feature is a depression and not a ridge. 7. As understood by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and I be live by Bin Saud also, the Western boundary of the Neutral Zone, follows an imaginary line drawn down the centre of the Shaq depression, this inspite of anything said in the con- venti on. 8. It may further interest His Majesty’s Government to know that Captain Papworth, R.E., in making his recent and very accurate survey of Kuwait and the Neutral Zone, placed the centre line of this Shaq depression at its lower end some 3 miles further to the West than is indicated on the million sheet. 9. In am submitting this report, I would suggest that the geographical error referred to be corrected in all 1929 and 1933 copies of 'Aitchison’s Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Sanads' without delay. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt .-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwaitn 2277/34. &gt;K' ' ^ Enclosure in Foreign Office covering better dated 4th April,1934.

Yusuf Yasin approached me this morning. He said that no definite agreements had been reached with Ydlibi before the latter left on March 23rd. Financial terms offered by Ydlibi in connexion with neutral zone were as follows:- all being payments in gold to Saudi.government and Sheikh jointly: oil in commercial quantities. Four shillings a ton Royalty thereafter. Loan of £50,000 on discovery of oil in commercial quantities and similar loan one year later. Yusuf Yasin said that Saudi government were communicating these proposals to Standard Oil Company of California in accordance with agreement with the latter. If the Standard Oil Company refused to offer similar terms government would pursue negotiations with Arabian Development Syndicate. He enquired whether in that case government £20,000 down on grant of concession. £10,000 annual rent pending discovery of should/should approach His Majesty's Government or whether syndicate should do this or whether government or syndicate should approach Sheikh of Kuweit.

They believe that California Company will certainly exercise their Company question arose whether if California Company now offered same terms as Syndicate Saudi Government (1) have right to give Syndicate further opportunity of making better offer or ( 2 ) are obliged to consent, so far as they are concerned, to California Company having concession. It would be of great assistance if you clear up this point and obtain precise information as to nature of opt i on as so;jn as possible. Opportunity should arise when Saudi Government communicate to you Calif rnia Company^ reaction to Syndicate’s proposals if not earlier. If (2) above is correct Syndicate would of course dis appear from negotiation with Saudi Government. If (i) is correct there might still be advantage in Iraq Petroleum Company reaching arrangement with Syndcate though they are net anxious to do so. Pending elucidation of this point therefore you should adopt non-committal attitude regarding Syndicate if Saudi Government repeats enquiry as to His Majesty’s rights of option. In discussion with Iraq Petroleum Government* s/1 - 2 - Gover merits ©pinion of its status. Anglo-Persian Oil Company hope that negotiations for Kuwait concession ©re approaching conclusion, when HOLMES will leave Kuwait. British group in Iraq Petroleum Company therefore now favour attempt immediately thereafter to secure grant of Heutral Z.ne concession from Shaikh for Iraq Petroleum Company on lines of suggestion in last para graph of your telegram 39 or option on concession similar to that held by California Company from I bn Saud. If deadlock ensued Iraq Petroleum Company might possibly be able to make some bargain with California Company. Iraq Petroleum Company feel however that they cannot approach Shaikh until Kuwait concession is secured. Importance of time factor and diifitx difficulty of your position vis a vis Saudi aV authorities have been impressed on me. A ■i 1 You may inform Saudi Government in reply to enquiry in 2nd paragraph of your telegram 51 that approach should be from Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government. It is impossible especially in present obscure state of matters to give direct answer to enquiry in your telegram. Moreover a positive declaration at this stage that Californis Company would be objectionable might give Saudi Government opportunity to put onus of refusal to grant concession to them upon His Majesty’s Government. Best reply would be that His Majesty’s Government would natprally prefer British Company. Question of affording protection to concessionary company and of exercising jurisdiction in concession area will be one of great difficulty. Ideal would be that protection should be assumed by His Majesty’s G©v ernment/ v\-3- Gover ment on behalf of both Rulers; but it is presumably unlikely that Ibh Baud’s consent could be secured. It is premature to raise question with him at this stage; but I invite your observations and you should take an early opportunity of informing Saudi Government that it would of course be necessary before any concession were granted that agreement should be reached between the two Governments and Shaikh in regard to method of carrying out in Neutral £one administrative measures that exploration of concession would necessitate. oppo^tARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN mm O.TJ WIVla i- ___ 4 ^ AFFAIRS -I.F.0.1927-1930.

J ohn s t o ne Foreign Office Mr. J .C .Walton ) Mr. J.G.Laithwaite ) Mr* G.E.Crombie ) India Office Mr. Fraser Mr. Lefroy A ♦ P, 0. C. Mr. Fraser explained that the A.P.O.C. had not yet been able to approach the Sheikh of Koweit about a concession in the Neutral Zone since they were anxious first to finish off their Koweit Oil Company negotiations with the Sheikh. In answer to questions from Sir Louis Kershaw, Mr. Fraser said that he had had a discussion with Mr. Moffat of the Standard Oil Company of California, who had told him that the Standard Oil had d efin ite ly n got the concession' in the Neutral Zone as far as Ibn Saul was concerned. Mr. Moffat's advice to the I.P.C. had been to go ahead and get a concession for Koweit and then cooperate with the Standard Oil. Mr. Fraser had been entirely non-committal in regard to this. He disliked the idea of having any dealings at all with the Standard Oil of California in respect of the area inside the red line, in view of the constitution and history of the I.P.C., since this would inevitably result in the Americans obtaining a bigger share in the I.P.C. territory than the other parties represented in the I.P.C. He was, of course, treading on somewhat delicate ground in discussing with Mr. Moffat/Moffat the intentions of the Standard Oil in the Neutral Zone. The I.P.C. had also been in touch with the Arabian Oil Development Syndicate. Mr. Janson had told him that Ydlibi had left Jedda on the 23rd March and was now on his way home with a view to proceeding later to Koweit for discussions with the Sheikh. Mr. Janson though he had no definite knowledge ? inferred that Ydlibi must certainly have obtained a concession in a more or less final form from Ibn Saud. Mr. Marner said that official information from Jedda confirmed that Ydlibi had left on the 23rd March but apparently no definite agreement had been concluded with the Saudi Government. The Saudis had communicated to Sir Andrew Ryan the terms offered by Ydlibi and had told him that they were now communicating these terms to the Standard Oil of California in accordance with their agreement with the latter. Some discussion took place as to the terms of the option which the Standard Oil was said to have obtained from Ibn Saud on a Neutral Zone concession. The information obtained both by the A.P.O.C. and by the Foreign Office was to the effect that the option represented Preference on equal terms”. Mr. Marner explained that the Standard Oil option was contained in the secret portion of the agreement betv r een Ibn Saud and the Standard Oil about the Hasa concession. The Foreign Office information about it had been obtained by Sir Andrew Ryan from various confidential sources and the arrangement had only been referred to in somewhat vague terms by representatives of the Saudi Government.3*) 3. Mr. Fraser would of course understand that it should he kept confidential. He suggested that if the Standard Oil Company agreed to a concession on the terms already proposed by Ydlibi when these terms were shown to them by the Saudi Government it might be that the Saudi Government would not be prevented by the option given to the Standard Oil from approaching Ydlibi again in the hopes of persuading him to improve on his previous offer. Mr. Fraser on the other hand thought that the Standard Oil option was more likely to mean that the latter company would have the right to clinch an agreement at once with the Saudi Government on the terms offered by Ydlibi. He suggested that the Standard Oil would probably clinch the bargain at once unless Ydlibi 1 s terms were extremely wild. Sir Louis Kershaw enquired whether the I.P.C. were not missing their chance of a concession by not at once entering into negotiations with Ibn Saud or the Sheikh. Mr. Fraser explained that the A.P.O.C. had some time before brought home a suitable man with a view to employing him in negotiations with Ibn Saud but they had decided that it was no use for the I.P.C. as a third party ? to enter into these negotiations in view of the information that the Standard Oil had already obtained an option on the Neutral Zone and that Ydlibi also appeared to have reached some sort of agreement with the Saudis. He thought that whatever terms the I.P.C. offered would certafnly be capped at once by the Standard Oil. In his opinion the only course open to the I.P.C. was to approach the Sheikh of Koweit and try to obtain from him an option in the Neutral Zone similar to that which the Standard Oil had obtained from Ibn Saud. The result would then be in the first instance a position of stalemate ? but he hinted/T ^ 0 4. hinted that the I.P.C. might find themselves in a stronger position vis-a-vis the Standard Oil of California after he % had had some further discussion with Mr. Moffat about the markecing of the Standard Oil Company’s production in Bahrein. It was difficult for the A.P.O.C. negotiator^ Mr * Chisholm, to approach the Sheikh about the Neutral Zone until Major Holmes, who, as Mr. Fraser knew, wished to enter into, negotiations with the Sheikh on his own account about the Neutral Zone, had left Koweit. The A.P.O.C. were accordingly anxious that the Koweit Oil Company's negotiations should be concluded as quickly as possible. He said that these negotiations were being held up at present by the fact that the Sheikh had not been given a copy of the political agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company . Mr. Warner said that official information tended to show that it was the question of money v/hich was holding things up. Mr. Fraser however, read a telegram which the A.P.O.C. had received from the Gulf saying that the Sheikh was becoming suspicious because he had not been given a copy of the agreement and that this was holding up the negotiations. It was agreed that the India Office should at once telegraph to the Political Resident saying that the text of the agreement might be given to the Sheikh and Mr. Fraser , though he could not indicate any definite time, hoped that it might then be possible to conclude the negotiations at an early date. Sir Louis Kershaw r then asked Mr. Warner how he thought the position would develop at Jedda in the interval supposing that Mr. Chisholm would be in a position to approach the Sheikh about the Neutral Zone towards the end of this month. Mr. /Mr. Warner said that Ydli'bi’s terms were now being shown to the Standard Oil and that much would depend on the actual form of the Standard Oil option. If the Standard Oil were able to take up an agreement on Ydlibi’s terms so far as Ibn Saud T s interest was concerned, the Saudi Government might then ask whether the Sheikh of Koweit and/or H.M.G. would agree to the same terms in respect of the Koweit interest. H.M.G. would be placed in a difficult position if there was still no other competitor in the field except Ydlibi. Sir Louis Kershaw said that the negotiations might have progressed so far between Ibn Saud and the Standard Oil as to make matters extremely difficult for the I.P.G. at Koweit. The A.P.O.G. representatives said that it was no use sending a negotiator to Jedda now when Ydlibi's negotiations had proceeded so far and when Ydlibi himself was on his way home. Mr, Praser was sure that when Ydlibi arrived in London Mr. Janson would not lose 8. moment before getting in touch with the I.P.Q., and there would then be an opportunity to obtain further information about Ydlibi 4 s offer to Ibn Saud and about the California Standard Oil Company's option about the terms of which Ydlibi ought to have a very good idea. Mr. Praser himself had never liked the idea of working through the Arabian Development Syndicate etc., but he agreed with Sir Louis Kershaw that the I.P.C. did not want to close the door finally on the idea of backing Ydlibi if this should turn out to be necessary. Mr,Warner pointed out that this would leave Sir Andrew Ryan in an extremely awkward position. It was now a long time since the Saudi /6 . Saudi Government had asked him for His Majesty's Government's views about the standing of Ydlibi and he was still putting them off Y^ithout a reply. The Foreign Office had hoped that the I..P..C. v/ould have been able to tell them at this meeting whether or not they intended to use Ydlibi but it appeared that they could not yet do so. Mr. Yfarner said that the Foreign Office would instruct Sir Andrew Ryan to keep up his non committal attitude in his discussions with the Saudi Government but he v/ished to emphasise the difficulty of the Minister's Position. He thought that if the I.P.G. succeeded in getting an option on the Neutral Zone from the Sheikh of Koweit ? the Foreign Office might not improbably think this the best solution of the immediate difficulty. Mr. Fraser suggested that the Standard Oil might only want the Neutral Zone concession because of its nuisance value. Mr. Walton mentioned that he had heard from Mr. Kemp of the A.P.O.C. that there Y\ras some suggestion of inviting the Sheikh of Koweit to this country as the guest of the Koweit Oil Company. He reminded Mr. Fraser that this was a matter Y/hich v/ould raise political questions. Mr. Fraser said that no action had yet been taken. He could not say whether or not the I.P.G. might decide that an invitation to the Sheikh was necessary in order to clinch their negotiations. At any rate he promised that nothing would be done in the matter without prior consultation with the Sir/ India Office.7. Sir Louis Kershaw summed up the conclusions of the meeting as follows:- (1) the Koweit Oil Company’s negotiations to he concluded as quickly as possible. In order to facilitate this the India Office would at once instruct the Resident that the Sheikh should be given a copy of the Government Agreement; (2) the Foreign Office to send a full explanation of the present position to Sir Andrew Ryan and instruct him to continue his non committal attitude on the subject of Ydlibi at Jedda; (3) that the I.P.C. should without delay obtain further information about Ydlibi 1 s offer to Ibn Saud and the California Standard Oil Company’s option when Ydlibi arrived in London. (4) that the I.P.C. might be able to gauge more clearly the strength of their position vis-a-vis the Standard Oil after Mr. Fraser’s further discussions withHUTele gran From I. ?.C.

LEFROY OF THE ANGLO-PERSIAN OUT COL ffANY ON 20th ArFlL'1^34, REGARDING THE KOWEIT NEUTRAL ZONE T ~ Air. Lefroy of the A.P.C.C. called on Friday ? 20th April, to give the latest information In connection with the 1. P.O.’s desire to secure a concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone. 2. He said that in accordance with the understanding reached the I.P.C. had established contact unofficially with Mr. Jan son of the Arabian Development .Syndicate. The Syndicate haa expressed themselves as optimistic and had made it clear that they were most anxious not to dispose of any concession they might secure to American interests and would very greatly prefer to dispose of it to the A.P.O.C. The latter, without taking matters further with the Syndicate, haa pursued independent enquiries as to the position as between the Standard Oil of California and Ibn Saud in tne matter. The result of these enquiries had, in the first place, been to confirm the information already in our possession, that Ion Saud had committed himself to giving the standard Oil an opportunity to compete with any terms which the Arabian Development Syndicate might offer ior Ibn Saud’s interest in a concession in the Neutral Zone. But they were still in the dark as to the precise nature of the option. They had, however, also obtained information, irom a source which they regarded as entirely reliable, that there was in existence a second option and tnat Ibn Saud had undertaken to accept any terms which the Standard Oil might be able to persuade the Sheikh of Koweit to accept in respect of the neutral Zone. Their source was such aS’in their/tlieir view to put the correctness of this information heyona a aouht. Having regard to it they saw no point in carrying matters furtner with the ^radian Development Syndicate 9 since it was clear that, given tne two commitments referred to above, that syndicate would never he in a position to deliver the goods. 3 . Mr. Lefroy said that in these circumstances his principals were of opinion that the only course to take was to await the conclusion of negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit about the Koweit oil concession and immediately on the completion of those negotiations to send Mr. Longrigg or other representative of the Company to Koweit to endeavour to secure from tide .sheikh an option on the Koweit Neutral none* Tne Company had recalled Mr. Dongrigg from Iraq, had discussed the matter with him, and had now sent him back to his post. No time would be lost once tne main Koweit concession was out of tne way. 4 . I told Mr. nefroy that I would let the interested Departments know what he had reported and that he might assume, unless ne heard to the contrary, that we agreed with his view tnat, in tne circumstances he described and on the assumption that his principals were satisfied as to the correctness of their information, the course he suggested was probably the only one open. 5. Mr. Lefroy subsequently enquired on the telephone whether he was correct in assuming that there would be no question of a Government agreement in the cs.se of the Neutral Zone. I said that there would certainly be a Government agreement and that it had, I thought, oeen made clear in earlier discusbions at wnich Mr. ^efroy had not/not teen present, that in view of the very special circumstances presented by the Koweit Neutral Zone, the safeguards embodied in such an agreement would probably be distinctly more stringent than those which had been imposed in the case of Koweit itself. 6 - On a minor point it may be of interest to re corn that Mr. Lefroy emphasised that the I.P.G. were most anxious to give no information to Mr. Stevens or other American interests of the position in regard to the Neutral Zone. V/nile American companies might compete against one another any information given in this area to American nationals appeared to be passed on. He v/as anxious, therefore, that if no objection v/as seen, we should avoid any reference to or discussion of the Neutral Zone in Mr. Stevens' presence. Asked to 6 ive any information as to the progress of the Koweit negotiations, he said that notning material had yet come in. On the question of money the Company had gone far to meet the Sheikh, ne had originally asked for 5 lakhs cash down. The Company had now offered 3s.450,000, and the Sheikh was asking for 3s.475,000.

(b) Confidential letter NO.R3/1489, dated 16th Muharram 1353 (30.4.34) from H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent. 2. In a conversation which I had with H.E. the Shaikh today (3.5.34), he (the Shaikh) referred to the above letter and enquired rather impatiently why it was that His Majesty’s Government of late did not seen to trust him quite as freely as they had done heretofore. He atideci theit tie thought it strange that in a matter concerning which he had on several cocas ions given verbal ana categorical assurances, to both the Hon’hie the loll bi cal Resident and myseli , he ehoi should now be asked to do so by written document. 3. I did my best to placate His Excellency, but I could see that he was not a little irritated, I may add^hat one of the commonest expressions he uses with me in our various discussions is 'My word is my bond and as good as my signature', so possibly this had something to do with his hurt feelings, but I am inclined to think that the delivery of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India’s message (contained in his telegram No.963, dated 17th17til iipril 19554) was the root cause of the trouble.

I am increasingly disturbed at possibility of two separate conflicts with Ibn Baud over Kuwait and area east of Blue Line. See paragraph 4 of my telegram ^o.40* Atmosphere may now be clouded by latest row induced by incident and no question can be considered without taking Account of Saudi-Yemen situation which may be develop- -ing more rapidly than seemed likely three weeks ago. If Ibn Saud wins in ccasflict with imam in which iiis *ajesty*s Government has done nothing material to help him he will be encouraged to resist our claims in eastern Arabia. he may be all the readier to do so though this is conjecture as a result of establishment of direct contact with Arab leaders t taking part in mission of mediation now here. If he is worsted by Imam he will think Ris Majesty's Government are taking advantage of his difficulties to emb&amp;rk on forward policy on eastern side of his dominions. I realise that policy in regard to question mentioned in first sentence cannot be altered. It occurred to me however that appearance of double attack on Ibn *&gt;aud might be mitigated by a preliminary communication on the following lines.••following lines if Shaikh of Kuwait abandons his pecuniary claimss Shaikh of Kuwait has waived claim and his Majesty^ Government intend to pursue actively question of Kuwait blockade settlement of which is imperative, Courwe of correspondence regarding claims has revealed dangerous misunderstanding as a result of direct corres- -pondence between Shaikh and ifcn Saud. in view of their special relations with Kuwait nature of which was explained to Saudi Government in 1927 ^ia Majesty*s Government consider iratter affecting official relations between ibn Saud and Shaikh should be conducted through xkxxfc their intermediary, fhis applies also to neutral zone regarding which baud!

(N 1839/1206/91) Foreign Office, S.W.l. 22nd March 1934. 3fR + 8 [ brs ‘{ f].H: rcns 'p 01 ' tBPOO 'rfitB? Sir, In your despatch No.72( 176/2/34) of the 13th Fehruary Your Excellency reported an enquiry made by the United Stated Embassy at Angora regarding the Anglo Turkish Convention of the 29th July 1913. This enquiry may prove of considerable importance, since there is reason to believe that the interest which it reveals on the part of the United States Government in the question of boundaries in 'lastern Arabia is in all probability connected with the activities of ^United States Oil interests in that area. As you are no doubt, aware, in July 1933, the Standard Oil Company of California obtained from king Bin Saud an Oil concession covering the Eastern part of his i dominions. To the north the Imits of this concession are co terminous with the frontiers between Saudi Arabia, on the one hand and Iraq and the independent principality of Kuwait, on the other. These frontiers are now laid down in certain agreements referred to in paragraph 4 below, but the position in the south and we south east is, however less simple. ^ 2. On the 29th July 1913, His Majesty’s Government conclude with the Ottoman Government a convention defining the south eastern boundary of Turkish Arabia from the coast of the Persian Gulf as far as the twentieth parallel of latitude. A second Convention concluded on the 9th March 1913, continued the definition of this boundary between this point and the already delimited frontier between the /ilayet of the xemen and the Protectorate. Copies of the 1913 Convention are enclosed in this despatch: the text of the 1914 Convention will be found onpaages 42 and 43 of the 1933 edition of Volume XI of Aitchison’s'treaties, Engagements and Sanads”, a copy of which is, I 53) understand in the library of His Majesty’s Embassy. The first of these Conventions was never ratified, but the boundary line laid down in Article 11 thereof was definitely adopted by Article 3 of the second Convention, the ratifications of tihich were ex changed in London on the 3rd June, 1914. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have not had occasion to discuss with King Ibn Saud, since he acquired independent sovereignty over Nejd and the Hasa Coast, the question of the precise boundary between his dominions and those of the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Governfcent although Ibn Saud has, by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of the 20th May 1927 formally recognised those special relations and undertaken to maintain friendly relations with the rulers concerned. But the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of 1913/14 line have now become independent States, cannot be regarded in the view of His Majesty’s Government as in any was affecting the status of the territories on the otherside of that line, which were then and still remain under British influence. His Majesty’s Government therefore still regard the 1913/14 line as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Successior State of Saudi Arabia and the territories of south eastern Arabia with ?hich the r are in special relations. 3. Having regard to the presence of United Stated oil interests in this area it is important that the United States Government should be under no misapprehension on this point. It is undesirable therefore that they should receive as full an account as possible of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the matter without delay, and should not be leit to obtain possibly misleading infomation from the Turkish or Saudi Arabian Governments. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will arrange, as soon as possible for the United States Embassy at Angora (a) to be furnished with a copy of the Anglo Turj ish Convention of the 29th July 1913, and (b) to be shown the text of the Anglo Turkish Convention of the 9th March 1914 (Aitchison3 Aitchison Vol.Xl 1933) pages 42 onwards). It should be pointed out to the United States Embassy that, while the 1913 Convention is unratified, the boundary laid down in Article 11 is mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted in Article 3 of the ratified Convention of 1914, which in the view of His Majesty*s Government remains operative. Further, since Article 7 of the 1913 Convention contains provisions regarding the frontier of Kuwait, it would be well that the attention of the United States Embassy should also bd drawn to (c) the Kuwait-Nejd Boundary Convention of the 2nd December, 1922 (Aitchison Fol.XI 1933 pages 213-4). Finally since in connection with the California Standard Oil Company*s Concession it may be of interest to the United States Government to have the exact documentary definition of the Iraq - Nejd frontier, the United States Embassy should also be shown the text of (d) Protocal No.l between Iraq and Nejd, signed at Uqair on the 2nd December 1922. (Aitchison VolXI 1933 pages 211-2). 4 # The United States Embassy may be given copies of any of the above texts which they may require and should be informed that Aitbhison* s ^Treaties is purchasable, if they or the State Department should require a copy. 5 . There is, however, one point arising out of the question of this frontier which needs special attention. I enclose, for your confidential information and guidance, copies of telegraphic correspondence between the India Office and the Government of India from which you will see that, although His Majesty s Government are satisfied as to the legal validity of the 1913/14 frontier as marking the eastern boundary of Ibn Baud’s dominions, some difficulty may possibly arise in maintaining that the territory immediately to the east of that line still forms part of the dominions of the Shaikh of Qatar. This point is receiving further consideration; and meanwhile, should you find it neces sary to give the United States Embassy any oral explanations o the matter, you should notwithstanding the fact that the convention specifically describes the blue line as dividing Nejd from ’’the territory of Qatar” avoid referring to theto the territory to the east of the blue line as specifically forming part of the State of Qatar itself, but refer to it merely as being under British influence. 6, I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Washington, and of the correspondence to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda.

Mr.Skinner was most grate ful for the communication which you had authorized me to make to him. He told me that he had been unable to obtain a copy of the unratified Convention of 1913 from the Turkish Government, who had searched their archives for it in vain, and said the. t His Majesty's Government should realize that matters of private interest, not of state interest were behind the inquiries which his Embassy had undertaken, the interest residing in the concession of an important Petroleum Company. 2. It was obvious that my colleague knew nothing about the geography of the region in question. I em phasized the point that what I was showing him was the south eastern frontier line of Turkish Arabia. His Excellency put no question about what was happening east of that line, so I did not refer to El Qatar. The Right Honourable - e / Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I .,KCV0., Et., Etc. , Etc.,He did enquire why the Ottoman 0-oveminent had not ratified the 1915 Convention, and on this point I was unable to enlighten him. I said, however, that as the 1914 Convention confirmed the frontier in question, and indeed also prolonged it further southwards to the previously delimited frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the Vilayet of the Yemen, and as that Convention had been ratified, the non-ratif icati on of the earlier convention was hardly relevant to the matter in hand. 3. I handed to Mr. Skinner, for retention, the copy of the 1913 Convention enclosed in your despatch, and lent him volume XI of Ait chi son’s 'Treaties', a further copy of which he said he would purchase for the use o^ his embassy. 4.

A My dear George, I write with reference to our discussion a few days ago about Ryan's telegram No.84, of 2nd May, on the subject of the Neutral Zone concession which has now been considered by my higher authorities here. The telegram seems to us to make it clear that Ibn Saud has committed himself very far to the Standard Oil as regards any concession in this area and that in these circumstances there is no real advantage in pursuing matters through Ydlibi. On the whole we therefore think that the best course would probably be that suggested by Le^roy in hie conversation with me on the 20th April, a note of tfhich went to you and the other departments under our printed letter P.Z.2716/34, of 26th April, viz: that once the Koweit Oil negotiations are over, the Iraq Petroleum Company should endeavour 'to secure an option from, the ohe^.kh of Koweit in respect of his interest in the Neutral Zone and to play/ V a Rendel Esq., C.M.G., eign Office, S. W. 1.4./ play for stalemate. We need not, I think, actively pursue at this moment the possibility touched on by Fuad Hamza that if all else fails the Neutral Zone might have to be divided between the rulers. 2. The questionmxt arises of what advice, if the view suggested above is accepted, to give Ibn Saud as regards Ydlibi and his associates. Subject to your further views and to the text of the Standard Oil option when received from Ryan, we think that it would be better to postpone a decision on this for a little while longer, and the fact that the Saudi Government have their hands so full with affairs in the Yemen makes it perhaps less probable than might otherwise have,/been,the case that they will press us very actively. 3. You wirll by new have seen Fowle’s telegram of the 3rd May, No.452. This is to some extent based on the misapprehension that the Kuwait Oil Company would be free to operate in the Neutral Zone. This, of course, is not the case, and we propose, if you agree, to telegraph to him as in the draft of which I attach a copy.4. I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and to Seal.

This morning I made amore precise communication to him on the following lines* I referred to Shaikh Vuauf Yasin's communication to me on April 3 when the Shaikh had stated ttet the Saudi Government were laying Ydlibi’s terms before the Standard Oil Company of California and intended to carry on with Ydlibi's Syndicate if Standard Oil refused to consider the concession on those terms. He had asked, (a) How the question of the Shaikh of KuwaiVs interest should be tackled, if standard Oil refused and the Government carried on with Ydlibi*s Syndicate; and (b) Whether, in the contrary event, His Majesty’s Government would see ary objection to a concession to Standard Oil Company of California. 1 said thatthe answer to (a) was that the approach should be made by the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government • As regards (b) I said that this was a very big- question as an affirmative reply would commit the Shaikh to a concession to Standard Oil Company of California* His Majesty’S Government would prefer in a^neral way to see the concession in British hands but they found the position obscureowing to thu action taken by the Saudi Government who had gone a long way wik without previous consultation with us# We didnot knww, for instance, the exact nature of the option in favour of Standard 0i l Company. ( Here I raised khx definitely thequestion in the second sentence of this telegram.) As regards Ydlibi 1 admitted that the Saudi Government had made an inquiry as to the/- 2 - the view taken of his Syndicate by His Majesty's Sovernraebt. This was the sort of inquiry which His Majesty’s Government hated naswering and I had not pursued it, on learning . Arab from Shaikh Yusuf Yasin that the Saudi/Government had made up their minds to proceed with the Syndicate, if the Standard Oil oi California dropped out, I hinted that HisMajesty's Government's own attitude as regards a concession to the Ydlibi Syndicate was non-committal and mentioned the fact that he had nbt reached London, when my instructions were issued* I drew attention to the point stated in the concluding portion of this telegram* (signed) AMDREW RYAN. 22.4.34.INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, I 25 1954 Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

My dear Earner, I send herev/ith a note of an interview yesterday evening with Janson and Ydlihi about the Koweit neutral zone oil concession, together with a copy of the papers left with me by Ydlibi. It speaks for itself. concession had been offered by the Arabian Development Syndicate to the Iraq Petroleum Company. I have been in touch on this point with Lefroy, who assures me that, so far /' as the I.P.C. are concerned, there has been no change in the our printed letter, P. b. 2716/34 of 25th April, and that there has been no recent approach by Janson to the I.P.C. Janson 1 s statement, so far as there is any basis for it, is therefore, presumably, a reference to the unofficial contact estaolished with the Arabian Development Syndicate by the I.P.C. and referred to in paragraph 2 of the note of the interview on 20th April referred to above. that the Americans were out of the picture so far as the neutr al zone was concerned. Lefroy’s latest information is to the effect that the Americans are still meenly interested in the neutral zone, and regard Ibn Baud as deeply committed to them in respect of it. Development Syndicate’s application, we should like to suggest for your consideration that it might be well at I have not mentioned in the record of the /u - interview that Janson also mentioned casually that the ) ) situation in regard to the neutral zone since his interview y with me on 20th April, of whicjr copies were circulated under As you will see, Jans on and Ydlibi took trio line Before we proceed further with the Arabian once/ Warner, Esq., FOEEICN OFFICE, S ♦ . 1.once to inform Ryan of the statements made by the Syndicate and ask him to ascertain from Fuad Hamza, first, whether there is any foundation for the suggestion that the Saudi Government have committed themselves in the matter to Ydiibi and his fiiends, ana secondly, what is the present position in regard to the Americans* On the face of it, it looks rather as though the Saudis might be endeavouring to get the Sheikh of K owe it and Ydiibi in line, with a view to getting the Americans to cap the terms offered and thereafter proceed with a process of bargaining between the competing parties.

Loweit Neutral Zone with King Ibn Saud. He had seen me previously on this subject and had also kept Mr. Parrer of the Department of Overseas Trade in touch. Ibn Saud had now granted a concession to the Company and they were anxious to pursue matters with the Sheikh of Koweit, They wished for advice as to how this should be done, 3* I invited the Company to let me see the terms of Ibn Saud 1 s confirmation. They replied by showing me the letter from the Saudi Minister of Finance^ of which a copy is attached to this record. On its being pointed out to them that neither the letter nor the statements in the Note (also attached) by Mr. Auwaynee appeared in any way to commit the Saudi Government to the grant of the Concession, they said that the Saudi Government, as explained by Mr. Auvv r aynee in his note, saw difficulty in giving any formal consent until the Sheikh of Kow T eit had been approached and had agreed so far as he was concerned. They were, however, entirely satisfied that Ibn Saud l s word was as good as his bond and that the reasons of the Saudi Government for not t 2. On a,i i ival he said that as we were aware his Corporation had oeen in negotiation for a concession in respect of the committing/commi't'ting uhemselYeB in wriilng were merely ‘technical in character. 4. I enquired what financial terms the Company had given Ibn Saud and was informed that they proposed to give him a lump sum of £10,000 down, and a royalty of 4/~ per ton. Similar terms would be given to the Sheikh of Koweit, neither party being treated better than the other. 5. I said that Mr. Auwaynee 1 s note referred to American competition. What was the position in regard to that? Mr, Ydlihi in reply made a rather confused statement at the end of which he said positively that the Americans were out of these negotiations and had no rights in the matter. This vras not contradicted by Mr. JansOn. 6. I said that I should have to take advice on the point which the Company had raised and would communicate with them in due course regarding it. I might however remark that H.M.G. would certainly in no circumstances advise the Sheikh of Koweit to agree to any concession until they had seen and carefully scrutinised its terms. The Company's representatives thereupon offered to send a copy of the draft concession, for information tomorrow. They added that they understood that the normal practice in approaching persons such as the Sheikh of Koweit Y^as that the political authorities should be informed, but that the approach should be direct by the Company. The Sheikh of Koweit was inclined to be rather touchy, and might, misunderstand it if the approach were made through H.M.G.* I replied that I was not in a position to indicate what our ansY/er would be on this point which I should have to submit /submit for consideration. The Company expressed the hope that they would receive a reply at as early a date as possible. 7- As they left I reverted to the indefinite character of the evidence that the Saudi Government were in any way committed. Mr. Janson and Mr. Ydlibi repeated the statement in paragraph 3 above ? and the latter handed me as supplementary evidence copy of a letter in Arabic uhich he had, he said, just received. ^Arrangements will ee maae to translate and circulate this.y^ J.

The Arabian Development Syndicate Ltd., London, E.C.2 Dear Sire, I enclose herewith Mr. Aoneini's report on his negotiations for the Neutral Zone Concession. Kindly note that as Mr. Aoueini will have no code book with him in Beyrouth it will be necessary for you to communicate with him, when you desire to do so, through me. Yours faithfully, (S gd.) H. C. Hammond.COPY S . S . TALODI 10th May 1934 Translation 01 a report submitted to the Arabian Development Syndicate■Limited . NEUTRAL ZONE Soon after the receipt of the Power-of Attorney, I resumed negotiations with the Saudi Government preparatory to the signature of the Agreement by Shaikh Abdallah el Suleiman, Minister of Finance, who is authorised bjr the Government to sign on its behalf as I am duly authorised to sign on behalf ofthe Company. Having prepared the way and after arriving at an agreement on both sides on all matters under discussion, we arranged for a final meeting when it was proposed to effect the signature of the contract. At this juncture, however, a new apprehension seems to have dominated the Government and that is - as long as this Zone is in partnership between the Hedjaz and the Kuwait Governments and as long as it is not legal that either the one or the other of these Government grant the right of exploitation of this Zone in part or as a whole, to anyone, unless both Governments who own this right in conjunction agree to it. On the other hand, the British Government is the mandatory Power in Kuwait and owing to the good and special relations between the Hedjaz and the British Governments especially now when the Government of the Hedjaz is in a State of War with the Yeman, it Y/as considered advisable, under the present conditions prevailing and for Political reasons, to take the opinion of the British Government before the signature of the contract. The/Tns i' 1 oi eign l,lini3'fcry, hoy/ever, had coinniunica'ted with the British Plenipotentiary Minister at Djeddah and informed him about the Government’s views and its consent to grant the Concession - on its part - to the Arabian Development Syndicate Limited. The Government insinuated, however, that they were desirous of obtaining the British views concerning this Zone but pointed out that the Company who were desirous of securing the Concession was British with British Capital. The British Minister asked for a delay of two days to enable him to communicate with his own Government on the subject. Later the following which is a resume of the opinion of the British Government, was handed in writing to the Foreign Ministry of Hedjaz. n It is a well known fact that this Zone is Neutral between Kuv/ait and the Arab Saudi Government and that it isowned in partnership between the two countries and it cannot be divided between them. No Concession for the exploitation of this Zone can be given to anyone unless it is agreed upon by both the Kuwait and the Arabian Saudi Government. Although the Company that had asked for the Concession is British, the British Government is of the opinion that it is only reasonable that the Company in question, should approach either the Kuwait or the British Government in the same manner as it had approached the Arabian Saudi Government and arrange to get its approval in the same manner as it had obtained the Saudi Arabian Government’s approval to the granting of the Concession. Then and not till then the arrangement would be legal. The/3 Tlie British Government saw nothing in the suggested method oX dealing with the matter that would touch the feelings of the Company or affect the Saudi Government if they were to tafce such a step: on the- other hand the British Government y/ ere of the opinion that this would respect the rights of Kuwait, the legal partner in this Zone.' 1 On receipt of this reply the Saudi Government, whose interests require that they should at all times maintain good relations with the British Government, and in consideration of the British Government’s desire and request in this matter concerning their mutual interests, sent me a letter, a copy of which is attached, requesting me to urge you to communicate with the British Government in connection with the Concession of the Neutral Zone in the same manner as we had approached the Saudi Government. On receipt of this letter I arranged for a personal interview with the British Minister at Djeddah, to ascertain his views personally. He repeated the same instructions submitted above. I accordingly cabled to Mr. Ydlibi the gist of my various conversations and requested him to allow me to proceed to Cairo to submit my report and take the necessary instructions regarding this matter. In reply Mr. Ydlioi telegraphed stating that it is necessary to obtain a written consent from the Government. Since a written consent is tantamount to signature of the Concession the Government when I approached them with a request f 01 a written consent advised me to this effect and stated that the personal promise given to Mr. ialibi by His Iwje^t;y the King is in itself a consent. In view ox the fact that the /4 &lt;S) qcj the British Government hs.d nov; e^rpressed its wishes in the matter the Saudi Government were of the opinion that it would not be advisable at this juncture to give a written document unless the Biitish Government or the Shaikh of Kuwait were previously advised of the fact. The Government stated, however, that as a special case it would suffice if a simple letter were received from the Shaikh of Kuwait addressed to the Companj/' advising them that he would be prepared to accept the terms of the Concession if the Saudi Arabian Government agree to it, and that he would be prepared to sign the agreement if the Saudi Government would do so. The Government added that this was clear evidence of their desire to facilitate our business and grant us the Concession. I repeat again that the Government here has special reasons, which I cannot disclose, that prevent it from signing the Concession before they are in receipt of, at least, such a letter as they have suggested, from the Shaikh of Kuy/ait. As soon as I have given a copy of this report to Mr. Hammond to translate into English and submit to you, 1 shall leave for Beyrout where I shall be awaiting your instructions. I left at Bjeddah my agent Ibrahim Shakir Y/ho is well known to Mr. Ydlibi to carry on in case an emergency should arise, during my absence. I have to inform you also, that the American Co., tried to enter into negotiations with the Government regarding this Zone, but the Government pointed out clearly that that is not possible. The American Engineer returned from his tour of inspection to the Western Zone and left forHassa ’where he is/^ 5 is supposed to prepare his report which will be submitted to the Government. Now the point oi issue is to obtain a letter from the Shaikh of Kuwait consenting to grant the Concession on his part. I leave this matter to you to decide; but if ;you find that my departure to Kuwait vdth any other person in whom you confide is useful, I shall leave as soon as you request me to do so. Or if you decide to send somebody else whom you can trust and who is on good relations wich the Shaikh of Kuwait, please inform me of the fact so that I might meet him where you think most convenient and acquaint, him with the situation and I suggest that this should be promptly done as no time is to be lost in waiting. My address in Beirut is known to you. Yours, Hussein Aoueini.Copy of letter received from Ministry of Finance. (Minister’s Private Office) Bef.

It is quite on the cards that neither of these latter Companies will find oil in their respective areas, i.e. has a and Kuwait, and if this is the case I do not imagine that there will be much competition for the small xone in between* 2. Of course the sterilisation would not suit Bin Saud or the Chaikh, but as it would only be for a period of a couple of years I think that their complaints could be resisted. 3 ./ J.G.Laithwaite Esquire, The India Office, London.3. while on the subject of the Kuwait Oil, it seems fairly evident that whoever holds the Kuwait concession / has got the 'bulge* on anybody holding the a one concession, Since ii oil is found in the latter area, the obvious - in fact the only present - port for export is Kuwait, and this will then be in the hands of the Kuwait concession aire.

The point raised by Dickson regarding the description of the 'Shaq' depression in the English text of the Kuwait Boundary Convention of 1922 as 'a low mountainous ridge' is of interest and may be of some importance. If the mistake oc curs in the Arabic which is, we understand, the authentic text it might no doubt be difficult to correct it at this stage, but it is possible that it is merely an error in translation.

P 4 Z. 3504/34. 30th May 1934. My dear Warner, Many thanks for your letter of the &lt;T 8 tn May enclosing a draft telegram to Ryan consequent on the recent interview here with Janson and Ydlibi on the subject of an oil concession for the Koweit Neutral Zone. 2. We concur generally in the telegram but (in the interests of putting Ryan as fully as possible in possession of such information as is available to us) would like to suggest the minor additions which I set out below. Paragraph 1. ? redraft to read: 'Saudi Government had, so far as theywsre concerned, in principle committed themselves to grant of concession to'. At the end of the same paragraph we might, in view of Koweit were now to state in writing that he would be prepared to accept terms of concession and to sign agreem subject to Saudi Government also being prepared to accept and sign, that would satisfy Saudi Government'. Auwayni’s note, add something like this: - 'If the Sheikh of .A.Warner Esq., oreign Office, Paragraph/ S.W.l# 'Py 1 p&amp; yh- • Line 4» ? Add 'Draft concession submitted by Syndicate also .« provides for advance of £50,000 in gold to be recovered from royalties to grantas of concession on discovery of oil in commercial Quantities and advance of further £50,000 gold within one year of date of first payment”. Paragraph 5. After 'out of the field” ? insert 'Auwayni reports that they had tried to enter into negotiation with Saudi Government, *but the Government pointed out clearly that this is not possible'”. Paragraph 4, ? insert after words 'Saudi Government's” the words 'position in regard to”. Last three lines. I do not think it would be possible to prevent the Syndicate (who have indeed behaved entirely properly so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned) from approaching the Sheikh of fcoweit, though we should, of course, much prefer to delay this if possible until the oil negotiations in regard to Koweit are disposed of and the Iraq. Petroleum Company can make an advance. But we should I imagine confine ourselves to informing the Sheikh that the Arabian Development Syndicate have asked to be allowed to approach him; that His Majesty's Government have replied that/that they have no objection; but that they arc entirely uncommitted as regards any proposals which the Syndicate may put forward; and that (if Ryan confirms that this is the case, as the correspondence available to us would appear to suggest) so far as they know Ibn Saud is still yiiite uncommitted in the matter* It might be better to say nothing to Ryan in the light of which he might say anything to the Saudis which would lead them to think that we were likely to give any active support to Ydlibi with the Sheikh. If you think there is anything in this you may be prepared to consider a redraft of the last four lines to run as follows:- '’..and that His Majesty’s Government are anxious to have complete and definite information in the matter to enable them to consider the reply to be given to the Syndicate”. We are disposed to think that it would be well for Ryan in his conversation with Fuad to refer again to the fact that an understanding as regards jurisdiction and protection would be an essential preliminary to our agreeing to the grant of any concession by the Sheikh in respect of the Neutral Zone. If you agree, perhaps you would add something to cover this. 1/CONFIDENTIAL. No. 589-S of 1934.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, 3.W. 1. 27th September 1934* My dear Dickson, In the course of discussions with Fuad Hamza about the Koweit Neutral Zone oil concession he reverted to a suggestion which he had previously made in conversation with Sir Andrew I Ryan at Jedda, that one solution of the difficulties which ^ had arisen might be the division on a 50/50 basis of the Neutral Zone (at any rate for this purpose) between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud. b« Any such division would, of course, have to be subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit. With a view to further consideration being given here as to its possible advantages and disadvantages we should be grateful if you could let us know: (a) What attitude you would anticipate that the Sheikh of Koweit would take towards such a proposal, whether the ^ division was to be merely for the purpose of the Neutral Zone oil concession or for a permanent abandonment of the Neutral Zone* (b) We understand that the Neutral Zone area is much used by the Awasim. Would you anticipate difficulty, in either of the events referred to in (a) on tribal grounds? (c) Gan you tell us (neither we here, Fuad Hamza, nor Hafiz Wahba were able to say) what considerations led Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud to lay down the boundaries actually fixed for the Neutral Zone in 1922. We assume that there was some good reason for this and it may well be that it would be material to any proposal now to divide the Zone between Koweit U«ut.Colonel H.R.P. Dickson. and/and Saudi Arabia either for oil puri)oses or permanently* (d) We should, in conclusion, he grateful for any other comments you might have to make as to the practicability and desirability f rom the local standpoint of a 50/50 division, and on the question whether such a division should run from nor.fh..-to south or from east to west. ( Prima facie, an east to west division would seem preferable, since it would enable the coastal area to be shared between the two parties)* Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) J.G. LAITHWAITE*P.Z.6160/1934. O* D. 0. 37, Queen’s Gate Gardens, S.W. 7. Confidential. 2nd October 1934. My dear Laithwaite, JkY Reference your Confidential D. 0. P. Z. £075/34 of 27th September 1934, regarding the suggestion of Ruad Hamza for a possible division of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. 2. As you rightly say, any such division would have to be subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Kuwait, and 1 trust therefore that it will be realized that any views expressed by me now do not necessarily represent those of the Sheikh. 3. My answers to your para. 2(a) , (b ), (c ), (d ) , taking them generally, are as follows. I have on several occasions discussed with the Sheikh the question of how he proposed to share the advantages and profits arising out of any oil Concession that might eventually be granted in the Neutral Zone. His answer has always been that these would naturally be shared by both Bin Saud and himself on a 50/50 basis. He has never suggested, let alone hinted, that he would favour an actual division of the Neutral Zone into halves. I feel sure, therefore, that the Sheikh would reject, and in strong terms, any suggestion on these lines, hhethe the proposed division were to run north &amp; south, or east &amp; west. 3 &gt;1 i£2. (i) The Sheikh looks on the Neutral Zone as his by right, and considers it the one portion of his territory which he was able to save, when, as he puts it, Sir Percy Cox handed over two-thirds of his kingdom to Ibn Saud. Any suggestion of dividing to-day what he believes to be his, and what he hopes seme day will of itself fall into his hands in the ordinary course of events, will, I think, be resented and resisted. It must not be forgotten that Sheikh Ahmad was young, shy and inexperienced, and had just come to the throne, when these events took place. He undoubtedly was . bitterly disappointed at what b.e felt was the sacrificing of Kuwait to placate the great Ibn Saud, and was only constrained to accept the situation (as he has often told me) because he felt that he could not stand up to Sir P.Cox and so to K.M.G. He also tells the story of how Sir Percy on his return from Cjair and obviously feeling sorry for him,premised that, should .bin a Saud’s fortunes ever decline, or/turn in the wheel of fortune ever give Kuwait her opportunity, then no one would, least of all H.M.G., hinder him from trying to recover his lost territory once again.(ii) The Neutral Zone possesses some of the best grazing on the Eastern Seaboard of Arabia, and is an absolute necessity to Kuwait, seeing that the Kuwait tribes have not a sufficiency of grazing,especially in lean years in their own c ountry. The annual grazing migrations of the Kuwait tribes (Fidawiyeh and Araibdar) commence firstly in the direction of the northern area of Kuwait State; a move is then made to the western area, which continues slowly down the Eastern side of the 'Batin' Valley. Next the 'Subahiyeh' and 'Manaqish' Zones (S.S.W. of Kuwait) are visited and grazed over, and finally the Neutral Zone is entered and its pasture land systematically dealt with. Kuwait and her tribes possess sane 25,000 to 30,000 camels, and a far greater number of sheep. It is physically impossible for these to satisfy themselves in Kuwait proper, even in ordinary years, let alone years such as we have had in 1933/34 when rains only arrived in March. (iii) At present the Sheikh’s tribes have a clear right to enter the Neutral Zone whenever they please. Were a division of that area to take place, there is nothing to prevent Bin Saud turning nasty, and refusing to permit them to enter that portion of the Neutral Zone allotted to him. This indeed might be expected to happen/4 h) a ^ happen, as a means of hurting Kuwait. For the Kuwait tribes to save thouselves would have to cro ss over the oorder into Saudi territory, where .ain Saud would no doubt know how to win them permanently over to his side, by the same slow and sure methods which he has adopted in the case of the 'Dhafir' (Iraq) tribe. Nor could the Sheikh ever hope to prevent this, if his tribes Were faced with starvation for their flocks for several years in succession. (iv) At present Bin Saud’s officials only enter the Keutral Zone to collect 'Zikat' from the Nejd f, Awazim n , who like the Kuwait tribes annually visit the Neutral Zone. No where does either the Sheikh or Bin Saud maintain or establish posts in the Zone. This arrangement suits Kuwait, for it keeps Bin Saud’s military posts at a distance, and south 'Arak^ of Arak. A division would bring the King’s or ) Ark ) posts 20 miles nearer to Kuwait. (v) The premising portions of the Neutral Zone from an oil point of view, are supposed to be (as far as anything certain can be said about it) on the south side and in the vicinity of ’’Ain el Abd” and 'Maqtaa” region, and again on the western side in the vicinity of ’’Jebel Fov/aris” (see sketch sent yesterday). Very premising surface indications, I believe, have been found at both these places (by Holmes working secretly sane years back). These facts are known to the Sheikh for rumour travels fast in/5. in the East. The latter would quickly realize that whether a division were tfiade from East to West or fran North to South, Bin Saud would get the 'plums” and he the barren hits. 5. It is difficult after so many years to remember exactly what considerations led Sir P.Cox and Ibn Saud to lay down the boundaries of the Neutral Zone as they stand. As far as my recollection serves me, however, Bin Saud was not allowed to have much say in the matter at all, for Sir P.Cox did all the settling himself , of the business. He undoubtedly was guided among other things by the following:- (a) He realised that the Kuwait tribes had an insufficiency of grazing, and must be allowed to have the extra bit, as represented by the Neutral Zone to-day (Colonel More also brought this out clearly). (b) He appreciated the fact that Major Holmes (who was at Cjair during the Iraq-Bejd b oundary negotiati ons) showed remarkable anxiety to get the 'Ain el Abd' region included in his Hassa oil concession; this I think put him on his guard, for A.P.O.C. interests even as far back as 1922 had to be watched. Hence the area was declared to be a Neutral one. 6. One thing I remember quite distinctly as bearing on the case - Abdur Rahman al Qosaibi who was actively assisting Holmes at Ojair, showed me 'Ain el Abd' on Hunter’s Map of Arabia and enthusiastically explained that it and the 'Al Maqtaa' region of which it/it forms part, were the most likely oil hearing regions in Horth Hassa - That Bin Sand and Hohnes^new this, and were out to include same in the concession which was about to be given to Holmes, (We know now that it was not so included, and that Holmes had to get a separate agreement out of the Sheikh of Kuwait later, for what came to be known as the Neutral Zone). 6. Lastly, not only would the acquisition by Bin Saud of the southern or western half of the Neutral Zone be likely to attract Fuad Hamza (and so Bin Saud) from an oil point of view, but two birds would be killed with one stone, as such an arrangement would enable the King to secure a much greater measure of control over the Awazim in their smuggling operations. The latter, like the Kuwait tribes, have an insufficiency of grazing in their own country, the n Suda ,! regions etc., and for three months of each year, they in like manner also enter the Neutral Zone to graze. They always do this when the Kuwa.it tribes are there, as this enables them both to meet their cousins, the Kuwait Awazim sections (some 200 tents) and to arrange marriages and giving in marriage among blood relations. Bin Baud dislikes this but cannot stop the migration; he knows that during the fraternizing large quantities 01 contraband articles (food stuffs and cloth especially) are quietly handed over by Kuwait-Awazim to Nejd Awazim, which is distributed among the tribe generally, and is eventually taken back to Hassa by them and sold. In other words the blockade officials are successfully flaunted and made to look ridiculous. Bin Saud and his henchman,Bin Jaloui, would like to stop the game. 7./7. 7.

I enclose a copy of a note by tne assistant Librarian, of my letter to Dickson, ana of Dickson's reply. The Assistant Librarian informs me that Dickson's suggestion that the word 'gal' is more probably a mistake for the word 'jal' is unlikely to be correct, and that it is most improbable that a local or colloquial wore such as 'jal' would be used in the Arabic version of the treaty document, which is written/ Rendel, Ssq., C«M.G., Foreign Office, 3.We 1 .- 2 written in the classical language, on the other hand, it appears that the Assistant Lihrarian f s own suggestion that the error may he the employment of 'dar' for '-tif , » n • • is, for the reasons given hy Dickson, equally untenable. in paragraph 8 of Dickson’s letter of 1st October, but I doubt whether we are likely profitably to be able to pursue the matter much further at this stage, as the error is in the text and not in the translation it could not be modified without discussion with the Saudis, which might be difficult; thanks to the correspondence we are now on our guard as to the possibility of any encroachment on the heutral Zone by Ibn Saud such as is referred to in paragraph 7 of Dickson’s letter of 1st October; and we shall know where we stand if formal discussion of the amendment of the Arab Text proves necessary at a later date, would you let me know if you agree? enclosures to Bushire, Koweit ana the Government of India.

Yours ever, (3d.) GILBERT LAITHWAITE.Pi Z. 6156/34. 37, QUEEN’S GATE GARDENS, 3 • V • 7 . D.O. October 1st 1934. Afy dear Laithwaite, Will ypu kinaly refer to your note to me of 27th September 1934, regarding the question of the error in the description in the Kuwait Neutral Zone Convention of 1922, of the Western Boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. 2 . with all aue deference to the assistant Librarian, I ao not tnink tnat the Arabic word 'aal'' a is a mistake for 'til' ' , which he describes as meaning 'a depressed piece of grouna having in it a hill from which it is possible to see all round'm It is much more likely, in my view, to be a mistake for the commonly used Bedouin word 'jal', which is used extensively in Nejd, Hassa, and Kuwait for a long lo»w ridge, (for example, Jal al Liyah, Jal al Zor, which are to be found north of the Bay of Kuwait ana on the road to Basra from Jahara)• 3. The word 'til tf or 'tel' undoubtedly means a small hill, usually of conical shape, in Arabic, but although it is extensively usea in Palestine, Syria and Iraq is certainly not used in Kuwait or Nejd, as far as I know. There the commonly accepted word to denote such a feature as a small hillock, cone shaped, is 'thalaat' or 'thalaiyat' its diminutive, (examples Thalaat al Dhaba, Thalaiat as Sur, both well known hills S.W. of Kuwait and west of the Neutral Zone respectively). The Bedouin also use the term ''Idairat' for a small peak rising out of a ridge (example 'Idairat al Hussin, Idairat al Hamdth), but I do not think we need bother our heads about this latter. 4/7/ 2 - 4. One thing Is pretty certain, In Bedouin Arabia a whole host of terms are used for natural features such as dry water courses, hills, depressions, flat open spaces without vegetation, pebbly ground, rocky ground, etc., etc., which are either not found in dictionaries, or have been so mutilated as not to be recognisable with their counterpart in the dictionary. A man like Philby who is an Arabic scholar coula probably say how and from what classical Arabic worn these Beaouin expressions have oeen arrived but I am airaia my Knowledge does not go as far. bo To ^turn to our subject. As the ^rabic text says that the Western Boundary of the Neutral Bone is K a low mountainous ridge called shaq (al shaqq )' 9 there clearly is an error somewhere, for as I explained personally to you, the shaq is a wiae shallow depression anything from 2 to 5 miles across according to location, with not a vestige of a hill or rise in its bed, through out its whole length - indeed it is so shallow throughout most of its length that in many parts of it the untrained eye cannot detect where tne western side begins and ends. 6 ° It is true that a series of low nages and isolated hillocks run down the Eastern side of the shaq as far as the Neutral Zone is concerned (as per sketch below) but as these lie generally speaking anything from 4 to 5 miles away, and as they bear other names such as ,l Jebel Puwaris', 'Arhaiya'’, etc., etc., one cannot claim that they have anything to do with the H shaq' depression proper.3 24. 1° Cf v. One tning is quite clear to us in Kuwait, irom the sheikh downwards - the centre line of the 'shaq 1 ' is understood to he the Western boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone, and I believe Bin Saua ana his people recognise tnis also, ana the only reason why I originally arew the Political Resident's attention to the curious mistake in the text oi trie Kuwait Boundary Convention of 1922 was that, as it stood, it offered an opportunity to Bin Saul ox possioly some day attempting to encroach on the Neutral Zone from the west by laying claim to the strip of country lying Detween the Pastern edge of the 3haq and the series of low ridges lying 4 to 5 miles to The East of it. Such a claim would appeal greatly to the Nejdi mind. 80 I personally think the mistake originally was due to tne fact that Englishmen or an Englishman (probably Colonel Lore) drafted the original Boundary Convention in English, without having any personal knowledge of the ground, ana guided by tne million sheet map of hrabia only, ana it was then translated into hrabic for the approval ana signature of the negotiators of the Convention. It would be quite easy for a person not knowing the ground ana looking at the map to think that the Shaq was a low nill. In fact I na\/e known more than three Englishmen who have made the same mistake when reading the map. The latter is by no means as clear as it ought to be. 9. apologising for this lengthy note, Yours sincerely, H.ii.P. DICKSON.INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. 3057r EASTERN (Arabia). September 25, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [E 6018/4/25] No. 1. Sixth and Seventh Meetings with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on September 25, 1934. THE sixth meeting began at 12 noon. The following were present:—• Mr. Rendel. Fnad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Laithwaite (India Office). Mr. Johnstone. The subject for discussion was the proposed oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone—an area between Saudi Arabia and Koweit, over which, under the Frontier Convention of the 2nd December, 1922, King Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit have equal rights. Mr. Rendel asked Fuad Bey to explain the position and the views of the Saudi Government on this question. Fuad Bey stated that he had little to add to what he had already said to Sir A. Ryan. The Saudi Government were naturally anxious that the oil in this area should be profitably exploited. They had been approached by a British group (represented by Mr. Ydlibi of Manchester, acting on behalf of the Arabian Development Syndicate) in connexion with the Saudi interest in this concession. Unfortunately/the hands of the Saudi Government were tied by the option( 1 ) which, as His Majesty’s Government were aware, they had already given to the Standard Oil Company of California,, in respect of the neutral zone, when granting that company their concession over the Hasa C oast. This option provided, inter alia, that, if the Sheikh of Koweit should agree for his part to the grant of the neutral zone concession to some other party on any specified terms, the Standard Oil Company of California would be entitled to offer to take up the concession, in so far as the Saudi share in it was concerned, on the same (oi better) terms, in which case the Saudi Government would be obliged to accept their candidature. Fuad Bey was reminded that there was no question of Saudi or Koweiti “ shares ” in this concession—a phrase which he had once or twice used. No part of the concession could be separately granted by either of the rulers concerned, but the concession could only be granted jointly by both rulers. Fuad Bey agreed, and admitted that the Saudi Government were not free to dispose of the concession or any part of it, except in agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit. At the same time they were committed, in so far as their own rights were concerned, to the Standard Oil Company, to the extent of the option. They were therefore anxious to reach some agreement with His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit as to the best course of action to be pursued. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the question, which was already sufficiently difficult, had been greatly complicated by the option granted by the Saudi Go\enn ment to the Standard Oil Company of California m advance of any agreement with the Sheikh. The Saudi Government now suggested an agreement with His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh about the concession; but such an agree ment should have preceded the grant of the option. The difficulties of e situation had now been very greatly increased. (Koweit Neutral Zone Oil Concession.) (!) See text at Annex A. B [206 bb—3]Fuad Bey agreed that this might have been preferable, but the option had in fact been given, and it was no good going back over the past. It was a situation of practical fact. The difficulty would disappear if the Sheikh agreed to the grant of the concession to an applicant such as the Arabian Development Syndicate, on terms which the Standard Oil Company proved unwilling to cap, with the result that their option, which they must exercise within thirty days, would lapse. Failing this, Fuad Bey suggested an effort to promote a combina- Iitbecou iEisMaj 6 | tie two Lry of 0 in P°t jfe i^ e l Hcate, tion between the Standard Oil of California and British interests, such as the ''' ^ It could no Arabian Development Syndicate, as had been done, for instance, in the case of the rn tlf United States and British interests competing for the Koweit oil concession, so '' that, agreement having thus been reached between the competitors, the option | Hr. would no longer matter. Bfstion, i Mr. Rendel replied that if the option could be eliminated as a result of some :t ' 111 other group putting forward proposals which the Standard Oil Company decided r f not to cap, the situation would, of course, be greatly simplified. It would then ' ! !l ' 1 presumably be possible for these applicants to put forward to the Sheikh of ■ r:1!lieIlb ' Koweit firm proposals which they would be in a position to implement, and which had Bt would, of course, be considered on their merits. But His Majesty’s Government Ltitorsf could not possibly tie their hands or those of the Sheikh of Koweit until the „ n - - - ~ If. Ren [inple of 1 in an: case complication of the option was out of the way and a firm offer could be made to the Sheikh. As regards the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government should endeavour to promote a combination of the Standard Oil Company with British interests, he explained in the first place that His Majesty’s f owno ' ) Government were not in a position to exercise such influence on any oil companies. The question of possible combinations between the various oil groups was one which only the oil groups themselves could decide, on commercial and economic grounds; but such combinations were often matters of great difficulty, owing to the complicated relations and understandings existing between the various oil groups Fuad Bey nevertheless considered that the idea of a combination between the groups was the most hopeful line to follow, and he was confident that the Standard ^ ne Oil could be induced to arrive at some understanding with the British group at present competing with them (i.e., the Arabian Development Syndicate). As reg; 1 not b( Mr. Rendel suggested that in that case it was for the Saudi Government to Aecase- clear up the situation as it affected the two groups so as to make it possible for ^ derm a firm offer to be made to the Sheikh of Koweit. ^|| s fetk Fuad Bey enquired as to the Sheikh’s attitude towards the matter. I tip Gove Sir A. Ryan said that, so far as he knew, no approach had been made to the Ifestioii Sheikh. Mr. Ydlibi or his agent at Jedda had told Sir A. Ryan at an earlier stage Mim that the syndicate were practically assured of the Sheikh’s consent to their jpng ^ proposals, but this appeared to have been an exaggeration, due perhaps to Mr. Ydlibi’s optimism. ^ Mr. Laithwaite confirmed Sir A. Ryan’s belief that no one had so far Ja()i approached the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr. Ydlibi and Mr. Janson, of the Arabian ^ , Development Syndicate, had wished to approach him. They had claimed that _ they were already assured of the concession as far as the'Saudi rights in it “I were concerned, and that the Standard Oil Company of California were definitely |j' |. 1 out of the running. Subsequent enquiries had shown that these statements were Lj. ) incorrect, and they had recently been told that they should clear up the position with the Saudi Government before proceeding further as regards the Sheikh- Fuad Bey admitted that there had been a misunderstanding on the part of ' I his Government during his absence in Asir as to the effect of the option. He had 1 ' cleared this up on his return with Sir A. Ryan. The position was that his I Jfr. j Government were willing to grant the concession, so far as their rights were %blyi concerned, to the Arabian Development Syndicate, but could not do so definitely ^ not e unless the Sheikh of Koweit were also willing to give it to the syndicate, and the feting § Standard Oil Company of California then refused to take the concession up on , the same terms. It was for this reason that he suggested a combination between 1 the two groups under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi ■, Government. jfl dl v3 “sis, ^ mb:;; tj's&amp;J wit:! emb. In bhe course^f fiirto discussion, Sir A. Ryan emphasized the consideration that His Majesty s Government could not commit themselves to the position that only the two groups which had been mentioned should be considered. The discovery of oil in commeicial quantities at Bahrein had stimulated widespread interest in potential oil-fields elsewhere in Arabia and it might well be that other parties, independent both of Standard Oil and the Arabian Development Syndicate, might wish to apply to the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr. Laithwaite endorsed this and pointed out that His Majesty’s Govern ment could not undertake to compel the Sheikh to accept one or other of the two groups mentioned as a combination of both. Mr. Rendel reaffirmed the view that in any case, as regards the two groups in question, it was for the Saudi Government to clear up the position. 1 Other candidates might also come forward and a period of competitive bargaining might ensue. This might cause considerable delay and moreover there were other questions to be considered, such as the necessity for an agreement between Governments regarding jurisdiction and protection in the area to be conceded. Fuad Bey suggested that there would be advantage in having as many competitors for the concession as possible. Mr. Rendel observed that this was not necessarily the case and cited the example of the proposed concession for Koweit itself. A strong rivalry had ended in an agreement between two competitors, and it might well happen in the present case that efforts to stimulate competition unduly might similarly defeat their own object. The further discussion was to some extent repetition, and rather involved. It turned largely on (a) Fuad Bey’s efforts to elucidate the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, who might, he feared, be adverse to the participation of the Standard Oil Company of California, to whom the Saudi Government were committed to the extent of the option, and (b) his efforts to show that a combination of interests would afford the best solution and could be adapted to the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government by securing that the parties to the combine should form a company of British nationality. As regards (a), Mr. Rendel made it clear that His Majesty’s Government could not be guided by purely national considerations. They would certainly, in the case of a foreign company, require certain safeguards; but the advantage to be derived by the Sheikh of Koweit from the concession would be a primary consideration. As regards (b), Fuad Bey suggested that His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government might at least agree on certain principles and developed his suggestion that the groups now in view might be brought to form jointly a subsidiary British company. He thought that the Saudi Government might find means to induce Standard Oil of California to agree to this. Mr. Rendel feared that a combination between a company as powerful as Standard Oil of California and one so comparatively weak in resources as the Arabian Development Syndicate would result in the virtual absorption of the latter by the former. He dwelt also on the difficulty of bringing pressure to bear on oil companies to effect combines, on the delicate nature of the play of interests involved in the creation of subsidiary companies, on the fact that the official nationality of a subsidiary might be illusory, and on the circumstance that any applicant for the concession would be at the mercy of the Standard Oil Company of California, so long as the latter enjoyed its rights under the option. Sir A. Ryan pointed out that in fact the technical nationality of an exploiting company was of small importance, compared with the financial interests in it. Mr. Rendel agreed, and repeated that His Majesty’s Government would probably in any case require special safeguards in the case of any company which was not entirely British. He then suggested that, as it was already late, the meeting should be resumed later in the day. This was agreed to. Before the meeting ended, Sir A. Ryan drew Fuad Beys attention to a statement which Mr. Ydlibi or his agent in Jedda had made to Sir A. Ryan personally, that under no circumstances would the Arabian Development [206 bb—3] B 24 Syndicate combine with Standard Oil of California. This seemed to him material to what Fuad Bey had been suggesting, although such a statement might not hold lt t i for ever. The subject was not pursued, but Fuad Bey intimated in an undertone ri r that the combination might be feasible, in spite of what had been said to tv &gt; ( Sir A. Ryan. 1^' it of any The seventh meeting was held at 6 p.m. on the same day, with the same litral ZoM attendance. ' P 0 ^’ all i Mr. Rendel gave a brief resume of what appeared to be the position. Fuad Bey had suggested that an agreement should be reached between the ue ^ n Saudi Government, His Majesty’s Government and the Shiekh of Koweit as to of the conditions on which an oil concession should be granted in the Koweit 111111 Neutral Zone. But even if this had not been impracticable on other grounds, the Saudi Government were, in fact, precluded from reaching any definite agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit about the proposed concession, since, whatever agreement might be made, the Standard Oil Company of California i Neutral could always come in under the terms of their option, cap any other offer that which cas might have been made, and oblige the Saudi Government to support their ^ikh of 1 application. The position thus was that no one except the Standard Oil Company gli Gove of California could at present make a really firm offer which they could in fact gg draw] carry out, since the Standard Oil would always be entitled to a preferential ©rporatei treatment as regards the Saudi rights, if they wished to claim it. This being so, Li Aral the only really practical agreement which could be reached between the Saudi p Government, His Majestv’s Government and the Sheikh would be to give a ' 9 b o rocnAm n concession to the Standard Oil Company if they were prepared to take it up, or ' ' 1 to some combination in which they would be the dominant partner—though such ^ a combination seemed unlikely. As Mr. Rendel had already explained, this was out of the question, as His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh could not tie their hands, and the Sheikh must be free to deal with any applicant who might apply. H If the Standard Oil Company of California, or any combination to which aeat( ^ ea v they would agree, could put forward a firm proposal to the Sheikh of Koweit, A :111V11 that proposal would be considered on its merits. But there seemed no reason why the Standard Oil Company should wish to take the initiative in putting ;ian ' eme forward such a proposal, since they were completely safeguarded by the option p e to ^ and could comfortably wait until some other applicant put forward a proposal i0weit ai1 when they could decide whether to cap it or not. |nse, and pld be: Fuad Bey enquired whether there were no means of tempting other oil | would companies to bid for the concession. IMriginally IHoreover, Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government had no means of bringing ^ ■ pressure to bear on any oil company in this sense. In the first place, any L ^ company making a proposal would know that whatever proposal it made was Kle liable to be capped by- the Sandard Oil Company, who would be entitled, under ly^ ■ its option, to offer similar or better terms. This would act as a great deterrent to other applicants, and greatly complicate their task in deciding what would be a fair price to offer for the concession. 1 ’ Secondly, he believed that the oil companies wmre likely to adopt a cautious Mr. policy towards this area. Wasteful exploitation of the 'world’s oil resources had Be flse i jjj be me putral ha in the past had now led the oil companies to proceed with great deliberation in the development of new territories. Most of the big oil companies already had large areas to draw on. The Standard Oil of California themselves were already engaged in the exploitation of a much larger area in Hasa, adjacent to the INeutral Zone. They would thus have no particular desire to hasten the exploitation of the Neutral Zone itself, and it might well be to their own best interest to use their option merely to prevent the exploitation of that area by any other group. In the circumstances, it might be very difficult either to get any other company to make a firm offer or to do anything which would have the effect of bringing the Standard Oil Company’s option to an end, and it looked very much as though , a deadlock might be reached. iH 0 dbet( 111 W Pi Mr,In reply to an enquiry by Fuad Bey as to whether Mr. Ydlibi could not with advantage make a direct approach to the Sheikh of Koweit, Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that, so long as the option remained in force, Mr. Ydlibi was not in a position to make any firm offer to the Sheikh. It would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to make the situation quite clear to the Sheikh in the event of any approach to him by the syndicate. Sir A. Ryan then put forward the following purely personal and tentative suggestion : The clause embodying the option was so worded as to treat the Neutral Zone as though it were part of a large area which was otherwise Saudi territory, and, indeed, referred to it as the £ ‘ so-called ’ ’ Neutral Zone, doubtless owing to a slip. Would it not be possible for the Saudi Government to get rid of the option as regards the Neutral Zone by persuading the Standard Oil Company of California to accept in exchange for their rights in the Neutral Zone similar rights in respect of an equivalent tract of territory not at present covered by their concession, but within purely Saudi territory? Fuad Bey did not seem inclined to pursue this suggestion; but he put forward, again quite personally and unofficially, an alternative suggestion that the Neutral Zone should be bisected, either for purposes of the concession only, in which case the concession in the northern half would be within the gift of the Sheikh of Koweit only, and that for the southern half within the gift of the Saudi Government only, or by a definitive political partition, a new frontier being drawn across the middle of the zone, the northern half being completely incorporated in Koweit and the southern half completely incorporated in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Rendel said that he thought that the first suggestion, i.e., for a partition in respect of the oil rights only, would be open to serious objections, particularly as the questions of jurisdiction, protection, &amp;c., which were in any case likely to lead to difficulty, would remain unsolved. On the other hand, although the matter would obviously have to be very carefully looked into, and he could not express any definite opinion at this stage, the second suggestion seemed to him to offer distinct possibilities. The existence of the Neutral Zone had certainly led to a great deal of difficulty, and if any oil concession were eventually given to a foreign company in it, these difficulties would be by no means at an end, since, as he had indicated at an earlier stage, it would be necessary to consider very carefully the arrangements to be made for protection, jurisdiction, &amp;c. If, however, the zone were to be bisected and the two halves of it were to be organically absorbed into Koweit and Saudi Arabia respectively, many of these questions would no longer arise, and a great deal of difficulty might be avoided. On the other hand, it would be necessary to consider the difficulties very carefully. In the first place, it would be necessary to know the precise reasons for which the zone had been originally created, and to make quite sure that they no longer operated. Moreover, he was under the impression that the Neutral Zone represented approximately the area of migration of the Awazim tribe; and there might well turn out to be insuperable objections to the bisection of an area inhabited by a single nomadic tribe, since this might lead to difficulties ovei allegiance, administration, taxation, &amp;c. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf aiid the Political Agent, Koweit, happened at present both to be on leave m this country, and Mr. Rendel suggested that they might both be urgently consulted. Mr. Laithwaite undertook to arrange this, and agreed that at first sight Fuad Bey’s suggestion looked as though it might be well worth pursuing, il only because it would afford a solution of the very thorny problem of the arrangements to be made for the exercise of jurisdiction and the grant of protection m the Neutral Zone. Fuad Bey explained that he had put forward this suggestion only as a last resort He Would still much prefer that a joint concession should be given, and still hoped that it might be possible for the Arabian Development Syndicate to make proposals either independently or in combination with the Standard Oil Company of California. Mr Rendel repeated some of the objections which had already been mentioned to this proposal, which in any case seemed likely to prove impracticable, in view of the terms of the Standard Oil Company’s option.As a result of the present discussion, three alternative solutions had been suggested :— (1) To eliminate the option which had been given to the Standard Oil Company of California by getting some other company, such as the Arabian Development Syndicate, to put forward definite proposals with a view to bringing the Standard Oil Company into the open, and getting them either to make a higher bid or to abandon their rights. This was really no solution, however, since the Standard Oil Company were entitled by their option to bid against any offer made to, and accepted by, the Sheikh of Koweit; so that it would presumably be impossible to eliminate the option by such means in advance of any approach to the Sheikh of Koweit, while any approach to the Sheikh of Koweit, while the option still existed, would be open to the objections already discussed earlier in the meeting. (2) For the Saudi Government to persuade the Standard Oil Company of California to abandon their option over the Neutral Zone in exchange for new rights for an area of equal value elsewhere in Saudi Arabia. (3) To divide the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Mr. Rendel was inclined to think that the last of these suggestions was the only one likely to offer a way out of the existing deadlock; and, although it was understood that His Majesty’s Government could not possibly commit themselves on the subject at this stage, it was agreed that it should be urgently explored in consultation with Colonel Fowle and Colonel Dickson, and that if it was desired to pursue the matter, the Saudi Minister in London should be informed of the result. Meanwhile, Fuad Bey undertook to let His Majesty’s Government know as soon as possible if any other solution of the difficulty occurred to him. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, September 26, 1934.

My dear Dickson, In tiae course of discussions with Fuad Hamza about the Koweit Neutral Zone oil concession he reverted to a suggestion which ne had previously made in conversation with sir Andrew hyan at Jedaa, that one solution of the difficulties which had arisen might he the division on a 50/50 basis of the Neutral Zone (at any rate for this purpose) between the sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud. 2. Any such division would, of course, have to be subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit. with a view to further consideration being given nere as to its possible advantages and disadvantages we should be grateful if you could let us know: the Sheikh of Koweit would take towards such a proposal, whether the division was to be merely for the purpose of tne Neutral Zone oil concession or for a permanent abandonment of the Neutral Zone.

Confidential. 37, Queen’s Gate Gardens, S.W. 7. 2nd October 1934. My dear Laithwaite, Reference your Confidential D.0.P.S.6075/34 of 27tii September 1934, regarding the suggestion of Fuad Hamza for a possible division of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. 2. As you rightly say, any such division would have to be subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Kuwait, and I trust therefore that it will be realized that any views expressed by me now do not necessarily represent those of the Sheikh. 3. My answers to your para. 2(a) , (b ), (c ), (d ), taking them generally, are as follows. I have on several occasions discussed with the Sheikh the question of how he proposed to share the advantages and profits arising out of any oil Concession that might eventually be granted in the Neutral Zone. His answer has always been that these would naturally be shared by both Bin Saud and himself on a 50/50 basis. He has never suggested, let alone hinted, that he would favour an actual division of the Neutral Zone into halves. I feel sure, therefore, that the Sheikh would reject, and in strong terms, any suggestion on these lines, whether the proposed division were to run north &amp; south, or east &amp; west. 4. My reasons for saying this are several, and may(ii)/ 2. r* . ^ (i) Tli8 oheikh looics on 'tlis HcutrsT 2on6 as his by right, and considers it the one portion of his territory which he was able to save, when, as he puts it, Sir Percy Cox handed over two-thirds of his kingdom to Ibn Saud. Any suggestion of dividing to-day what he believes to be his, and what he hopes sane day will of itself fall into his hands in the ordinary course of events, will, I think, be resented and resisted. It must not be forgotten that Sheikh Ahmad was young, shy and inexperienced, and had just come to the throne, when these events took place. He undoubtedly was bitterly disappointed at what Ije felt was the sacrificing of Kuwait to placate the great Ibn Saud, and was only constrained to accept the situation (as he has often told me) because he felt that he could not stand up to Sir P.Cox and so to H.M.G. He also tells the story of how Sir Percy on his return from Cjair and obviously feeling sorry for him,premised that, should Bin a Baud’s fortunes ever decline, or^/turn in the wheel of fortune ever give Kuwait her opportunity, then no one would, least of all H.M.G. , hinder him from trying to recover his lost territory once again.V V V 3. (ii) The Neutral Zone possesses some of the best grazing on the Eastern Seaboard of Arabia, and is an absolute necessity to Kuwait, seeing that the Kuwait tribes have not a sufficiency of grazing,especially in lean years in their own country. The annual grazing migrations of the Kuwait tribes (Fidawiyeh and Araibdar) commence firstly in the direction of the northern area of Kuwait State; a move is then made to the western area, which continues slowly down the Eastern side of the 'Batin’* Valley. Next the 'Subahiyeh' and 'Manaqish' Zones (S.S.W. of Kuwait) are visited and grazed over, and finally the Neutral Zone is entered and its pasture land systematically dealt with. Kuwait and her tribes possess seme 25,000 to 30,000 camels, and a far greater number of sheep. It is physically impossible for these to satisfy themselves in Kuwait proper, even in ordinary years, let alone years such as we have had in 1933/34 when rains only arrived in March. (iii) At present the Sheikh’s tribes have a clear right to enter the Neutral Zone whenever they please. Were a division of that area to take place, there is nothing to prevent Bin Saud turning nasty, and refusing to permit them to enter that portion of the Neutral Zone allotted to him. This indeed might be expected to happen/v^s happen, as a means of hurting Kuwait. For the Kuwait tribes to save thorselves would have to cro ss over the border into Saudi territory, where Bin Saud would no doubt know how to win them permanently over to his side, by the same slow and sure methods which he has adopted in the case of the 'Dhafir' (Iraq) tribe. IT or could the Sheikh ever hope to prevent this, if his tribes were faced with starvation for their flocks for several years in succession. (iv) At present Bin Saud’s officials only enter the Beutral Zone to collect M Zikat' from the Kejd^Awazim', who like the Kuwait tribes annually visit the Neutral Zone. No where does either the Sheikh or Bin Saud maintain or establish posts in the Zone. This arrangement suits Kuwait, for it keeps Bin Saud’s military posts at a distance, and south of Arak. A division would bring the King’s posts 20 miles nearer to Kuwait. (v) The premising portions of the Neutral Zone from an oil point of view, are supposed to be (as far as anything certain can be said about it) on the south side and in the vicinity of 'Ain el Abd' and 'Maqtaa' region, and again on the western side in the vicinity of 'Jebel Fowaris' (see sketch sent yesterday). Very premising surface indications, I believe, have been found at both these places (by Holmes working secretly sane years back). These facts are known to the Sheikh for rumour travels fast in/■II in the East. The latter would quickly realize that whether a division were &amp;ade frcm East to West or fran North to South, 3in Baud would get the ”plums” and he the barren bits. 5. It is difficult after so many years to remember exactly what considerations led Sir P.Cox and Ibn Saud to lay down the boundaries of the Neutral Zone as they stand. As far as my recollection serves me, however, .Bin Saud was not allowed to have much say in the matter at all* for Sir P.Cox did all the settling himself .» of the business. He undoubtedly was guided among other things by the following:- (a) He realised that the Kuwait tribes had an insufficiency of grazing, and must be allowed to have the extra bit, as represented by the Neutral Zone to-day (Colonel Ilore also brought this out clearly). (b) He appreciated the fact that Major Holmes (who was at Ojair during the Iraq-Hejd boundary negotiations) showed remarkable anxiety to get the ”Ain el Abd” region included in his Hassa oil concession; this I think put him on his guard, for A.P.C.C. interests even as far back as 1922 had to be watched. Hence the area was declared to be a Neutral one. 6. One thing I remember quite distinctly as bearing on the case - Abdur Rahman al Q,osaibi who was actively a-ssisting Holmes at Ojair, showed me 'Ain el Abd” on Hunter's Map of Arabia and enthusiastically explained that it and the ”Al Kaqtaa” region of Wj-Acji it/it forms part, were the most likely oil bearing regions in forth nassa - That Bin Sand and Holmes^new this, and were out to include same in the concession which wa,s about to be given to Holmes. (We know now that it was not so included, and that Holmes had to get a separate agreement out of the Sheikh of Kuwait later, for what came to be known as the Keutral Zone). 6. Lastly, not only would the acquisition by Bin Saud of the southern or western half of the Heutral Zone be likely to attract Fuad Hamza (and so Bin Saud) from, an oil point of view, but two birds would be killed with one stone, as such an arrangement would enable the King to secure a much greater measure of control over the Awazim in their smuggling operations. The latter, like the Kuwait tribes, have an insufficiency of grazing in their own country, the 5, Suda ,! regions etc., and for three months of each year, they in like manner a,lso enter the Neutral Zone to graze. They always do this when the Kuwait tribes are there, as this enables them both to meet their cousins, the Kuwait Awazim sections (some 200 tents) and to arrange marriages and giving in marriage among blood relations. Bin Saud dislikes this but cannot stop the migration;, he knows that during the fraternizing large quantities of contraband articles (food stuffs and cloth especially) are quietly handed over by Kuwait •* Awazim to ITejd Awazim, which is distributed among the tribe generally, and is eventually taipen back to Hassa oy them and sold. In other words the blockade officiai-is are successfully flaunted and made to look ridiculous. Bin Saud and his henchman,Bin Jaloui, would like to stop the game.tl m /• I have written at some length, I fear, but unless I bo so, it is difficult to draw the necessary pen picture, that I want to convey to you.
