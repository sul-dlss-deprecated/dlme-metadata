Flying boats anchor off Manama and the anchorage for B.I. steamers is opposite the town. Houses are stone buildings usually built' in the form of flats with offices on the ground floor and residences above. Accommodation for married officers is limited. Electric light, fans and refrigerators are””^ installed in the houses, the occupants paying for the current consumed and for the lamps. Furniture is provided but not curtains, carpets, crockery, cookin^ utensils, plate or linen. It is inadvisable and unnecessary to incur the expenditure of bringing out-any heavy furniture but the addition of cushions, curtains and a rug or two to put on the cement floors, and personal effects, make the house more comfortable. In normal times china, cooking utensils, etc. could be purchased in Bahrain but at present (194-5) there is a shortage of these things in the shops. It is advisable to bring sheets, towels, table mats and kitchen and pantry cloths. The glass and china obtainable in the bazaar is of poor quality and if some can be sent from England it is better. Plate, cutlery and cooking utensils are not always obtainable in the shops. 5. DKEfS. Men - Summer. Shirts, slacks or shorts and sun helmets are worn and light tropical' suits in the summer. In the evening white open-neck short sleeved shirts, white slacks, black socks, evening shoes and black cummerbunds are worn during the hot weather. On official occasions, for dinner, a white dinner jacket and a white soft shirt with a black tie is necessary. Aertex or cellular day shirts are the most suitable and cellular vests are useful, not for warmth but for absorbing sweat. Silk is unsuitable in tne very hot weather, it becomes damp and creases. Light brown leather or suede shoes or sandals are usually worn. Some can be bought ready' made or they can be made by local shoe makers. It is usually possible to buy material f or shirts and suits in the bazaar. If pyjamas are worn they should be cotton, many people prefer to use 'bungis” waist cloths, made of locally woven cotton material. Uniform is not worjn. by officials of the Government of Bahrain. Winter. I,.-., In the cold weather ordinary tweed suits are worn or flannel, trousers and sports coats, and dinner jackets are used in the evening. It is cold enough for pullovers and overcoats especially after sunset. Women - Winter . In^ the cold season women require the type of clothing which is-worn in ih Apria. ano. May- with the addition of a really warm coat., somp. after noon frocks and a few dinner frocks. Shoes are best taken from Ehgland as those on sale in the bazaar are not good. Sun helmets are scarcely worn and can be bought in the bazaar. Mosquito boots are never Worn. Summer. ' F; ■ — my ■ ■ V Washing frocks, preferably cotton, are the best wear in the very hot weather as linen or silk are unsuitable when the temperature is high and it is humid. Light frocks are usually worn from April to early December, one - or two washing evening frocks are useful. Hats are rarely worn but on some - occasions, such as cificial parties, a hat is required. In normal, times cotton dress materials can be bought locally. Clothes are washed by Indian '’dhobis', washermen, who keep them for a week. On the whole they wash clothes quite well. ' - * 6.

SERVANTS Local servants perforr.; domestic duties more or less adequately and are a u ^ally more satisfactory than foreign servants, by which is rneyno Indians. It may be said, generally, that Europeans get the servants they deserve. If trouble is taken to train entirely raw local boys they become excellent servants. Most cooks and houseboys are of Persian origin. Eo servants should be employed without previous reference to the police The requirements of a single man or a married couple can be supplied by either one Z ^ riSen Sharply durin S the war, cooks are paid from Rs. 6y- to Rs. 80/- p.m., houseboys from Rs. 50/- to Rs. 70/- varying according to their accomplishments. Goanese cooks, from India, 'are a luxury; they ^ X10t 1 } QS ? th f n Rs * 10 °/~ P* m * and moreover they expect to be provided . r, G ?°r f ° accompany them when shopping. No servants are provided witn food but the employer is expected to get them -clothes to wear when on u y. n most cases they live out, in their own homes in the town. No women servants are employed. As the servants are all Moslems the question - 1 of caste does not occur. ± 8. DRINK. , ..... Bahrain is a Moslem 'tate and officially 'dry”, but Europeans are allowed ..° ' °n purciase^a limited amount of liquor on a-special permit. Liquor is sold by the firm of Gray Mackenzie, the shipping agents. Prices, compared . England and adjoining countries in the East, are cheap as the customs duty is only Ib/o.. It. is essential that liquor should be kept' under lock and key as spirits fetch high prices in the bazaar. Bahrain subjects found in possession of liquor are liable to severe punishment in the local courts. 9. RECREATIONS There is no shooting in Bahrain and the import of arms and ammunition is prohibited. The import of dogs is prohibited unless the owner can produce a certificate from a qualified veterinary surgeon to the effect that the animal has been inocculated with anti-rabies vaccine. Rabies is unknown in Bahrain though very prevalent in neighbouring countries. Membership of the ^yiMchana Club enables members to use the golf course, tennis courts and bathing pool. There is good sea bathing at places on the ooast and sea . /fishing.fishing. Fresh water pools abound. There is no public' library in Bahrain and it is advisable to place an order with a newsagent for periodicals. Air- nail letters take about ten days from England^ newspapers take about six 'weeks. 10. CHURCHES. , There is a nission church of the Dutch Reformed Church of America in Manama and also a Catholic Church with a resident Priest. Anglican services are held occasionally and a project for building an Anglican Church is under way. There is a building, used for Anglican and other services, at Awali, the headquarters of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, about 12 miles from Manama Mr the centre of the island. Service chaplains frequently visit Bahrain to attend to the needs of the Naval Base, which is situated about three miles from Manaix. and the R.A.F. who are stationed on Muharraq Island. 11. LANGUAGE. The language of Bahrain is.Arabic but in the towns a good deal of Persian and some Hindustani is spoken. Most of the shopkeepers speak some English. It is essential that all Europeans in the service of the Bahrain Government should acquire a knowledge of Arabic. Local teachers are available for giving lessons in Arabic. The best Arabic book for use in Bahrain is Van Ess’s Spoken Arabic of Mesopotamia. The only book which deals exclusively with the Persian Gulf is A.T. Wilson*s Persian Gulf, now out of print. 12. OFFICE HOURS. ' Office hours vary considerably according; to duties. In general, offices are open from 8 a.m* till 2 p.m. Some offices open later in the morning and also in the afternoon. There is a telephone- system in Bahrain and automatic telephones are shortly to be installed. ■ There is no local postal service. There are.two banks in Bahrain, the Eastern Bank and the Imperial Bank of Iran. The former fulfils many of the Services of Government Treasury. The Arabic Calendar is used by the Bahrain Government; the Arabic year is about ten days shorter than the Gregorian year. Moslem holidays are kept. Offices close on Friday, not on Sunday. 13. LEAVE. . ' • There is no hill station close- to, Bahrain where people can go for. a change of air. If home leave is not taken the. nearest- cool stations are the Lebanon Mountains in Syria, or hill stations in India. These places can be reached by air or by steamer and train but fares are at present extremely high and steamer services are uncertain. 1A. FOOD. It is difficult under the present changing conditions to give reliable information about food supplies. At the time of writing, 194-5, the prices of most foodstuffs are controlled by the-Government and cereals, including flour, wheat and barley, and sugar are rationed at the scale of 20 lbs of cereals and 3 lbs. of sugar per head per month. Meat, consisting of beef and mutton is plentiful, of better quality than in neighbouring countries and a little cheaper than in England. Excellent fish of many different kinds is available throughout the year. Although Bahrain is the centre of the pearl industry oysters are not obtainable as those found are not edible. There is very little fruit apart from melons and fresh dates in the summer. In the winter - - European vegetables are grown and in the summer there are local vegetables cf rather a dull type on sale in the markets. Poultry is expensive, eggs are about half the size of European- eggs. Milk, if the cows are v/ell fed, is extremely good and fresh butter can be made from it, but the great .increase in the demand for milk has caused many of the cattle owners to water the milk. In normal times the shops stocked large supplies of tinned goods of all descriptions from Europe, America and India but owing to the war stocks of tinned goods have almost disappeared. Cooking is done mainly on oil stoves. Hot water is not laid on in most of the Government houses.s / Lo NOTES FOR ^PERSONS PROCEEDING TO EAFfRA TN 1. Introductory. 2. Political. 3. Climate. 4.
