Such a combination was not only used as decoration but also as a ritual instrument by holding the \"menat\" in the hand and rattling the beads of the collar. \r\n<p /> <p />\r\nThe three-dimensional depiction of \"wesekh\" and \"menat\" combined with a divine head became an important symbol. The head of a feline goddess atop this model collar indicates that it is intended as a personification of her powers, conveying in its decoration the ability of the lioness both to protect and to nourish the king. Her dual nature is evoked by her stern and watchful face on the front side, and by her representation as a mother suckling a young prince on the reverse. This precious object may have been produced for someone of the royal family.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1924", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/39570", "Keywords": "lion; pectoral; Wadjet; jewelry; ornament; sun; line; pattern", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1924, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "22nd-23rd Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:40.877", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_57.540_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_57.540_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_57.540_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_57.540_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_57.540_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "13, 850, 2360, 2513, 3193, 3240", "Images": "PS1_57.540_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_57.540_3QtrRt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_57.540_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Ancient Treasury"}
