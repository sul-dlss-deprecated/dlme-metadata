Madam, I most gratefully avail myself of Your Majesty's gracious permission to bring under Your Majesty's consideration the geographical and historical results of the Expedition which His Majesty, the late King William the Fourth, was pleased to intrust to my command, and which was ordered to explore the Euphrates and Tigris, with the countries adjacent to those great rivers. The Two Volumes now humbly presented to Your Majesty contain, with a detailed account of the state of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris, some geographical and historical notices of the countries which were the cradle of the human race, and the theatre of the most important events in the Jewish, Pagan, and* early Christian histories; countries extending from the River Nile to the eastern extremity of the empire of Alexander the Great, where the many glorious achievements of Your Majesty's arms have recently terminated with the brilliant victory of Goojerat.vi Many disappointments in the execution of the maps and plates, and an absence of four years on Your Majesty's service in a distant land, joined to the loss of my manuscripts after my return home, are the reasons now humbly offered in excuse for the delay which has occurred in the publication of this portion of my Work. I have the honour to be. Madam, With profound respect, Your Majesty's most humble and devoted Servant, F. R. Chesney, Lieut,-Colonel commanding Royal Artillery, Cork District. BallincoUig, February 5, 1850.PREFACE. In presenting the following pages, and an atlas containing four teen maps, to the Public, the Author considers it incumbent on him to avail himself of the privilege afforded by a Preface, for the purpose of explaining the circumstances under which the work has been executed. He is particularly bound to notice three points:—first, the object of the enterprise, and the manner in which it was committed to his management; secondly, the plan of the present work; and, lastly, the causes which have delayed its appearance. The appointment to the command of the Expedition occurred in a manner little anticipated. The Author was about to return to England at the termination of hostilities in 1829, after having visited the Russian and Turkish armies in Roumelia, towards the close of that year, when the British Ambassador at the Porte, the late Sir Robert Gordon, suggested that a tour similar to that which had been just made, should be undertaken, for the purpose of ascertaining the state of the other Turkish pro vinces; and as this suggestion removed all difficulties about leave of absence, an extensive journey was forthwith planned. On learning that the city of Baghdad was to be visited in the course of the proposed journey, the late Consul-General in Con stantinople, Mr. Cartwright, recommended the accomplishment of a project, which, it appears, had been drawn up by Mr. Peacock of the India House, for determining the depth, current, andviii PREFACE. state of the river Euphrates generally; and, on the Author's subsequent arrival in Alexandria, he received from Mr. Barker, our Consul-General in Egypt, a list of queries which had been sent to him by the Earl of Aberdeen, regarding the compara tive advantages of the proposed lines to India, by the Euphrates, and by the Eed Sea. Circumstances being then favourable, the Author determined to extend his travels so far as to enable him to answer these 'queries, as well as to gain the ends before proposed; accordingly he commenced with the Isthmus of Suez, and passed down the Eed Sea to Kosseir. Thence he crossed the desert to the Nile, which he afterwards descended to its mouths. 1 The Author now embarked for Jaffa, and proceeded through Palestine, Syria, &amp;c., to the Euphrates, which river he de scended, principally on a raft made of hurdles, from El Kay em to its estuary; and prepared a map on a scale of two inches to a mile, showing the depth, current, &amp;;c., throughout a distance of 701 miles thus surveyed'. An examination of the rivers of Susiana followed; but as one very important object, the state of the higher Euphrates, still remained to be ascertained, the Author continued his retrograde journey through Persia and Asia Minor, and carefully examined the upper part of the river, as well as the country lying between its banks and the ports of the Mediterranean. A statement of the relative advantages of the routes to India by the Eed Sea and the Euphrates was afterwards laid before the British Government through the late and present Ambassadors at the Porte, Sir Eobert Gordon and Sir Stratford Canning. 2 A matter of such great national importance, when recom- 1 See Letter, p. 88-91, in Appendix to the Report from the Select Com mittee on Steam Navigation to India, 14th July, 1834. 2 Ibid., p. 50-98.preface. ix mended by those distinguished statesmen, could not fail to attract notice; and the Author had the pleasure of finding, on his return to England, that the subject of steam navigation to India was under consideration, more particularly by Lord Goderich, the President of the Board of Control, the Eight Honourable Charles Grant, and the late Right Honourable John Sullivan. Not long afterwards, the presence of the Author was com manded at St. James's, when the late king, William the Fourth, was pleased to express a desire that the route by the Euphrates to India should be put practically to the test; more particu larly, as His Majesty observed, on account of the manifest ad vantage which it presented of involving little more than one- half of the length of sea voyage, compared with that of the route by the Red Sea. The further consideration of the question was confided to the Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord Goderich, and Mr. Grant, now Lord Glenelg; and in 1834 a Committee of the House of Commons, with the latter Minister as Chairman, having taken evidence at great length on the routes by the Red Sea, and by the Euphrates, a vote of Parliament was passed for surveying the latter by means of a steam expedition. Two iron steam-vessels were ordered to be constructed by Messrs. John Laird and Co. of Liverpool; which, when finished, were the sixth and seventh of that kind then built, and the first of the flat armed steamers, whose services have been so im portant in the rivers of Asia. The command of the Expedition was intrusted to the Author; and the autumn was employed in selecting naval and military officers, and in making other pre parations for the equipment. In these the King took a warm interest, and every step of the progress being made known by private letters to Sir Herbert Taylor, His Majesty was pleased vol. i. a*x PREFACE. to cause letters to be written to the Ordnance, to the Admiralty, and other departments, with a view to their hearty furtherance of the objects. The Author was allowed to select from the Koyal Artillery and Royal Sappers and Miners certain workmen, particularly smiths and millwrights, in all twenty-seven, who were after wards employed in Mr. Laird's yard in riveting, and in other work connected with iron vessels. This measure was scarcely of less consequence than the selection of officers. The qualifi cations of these, with respect to steam machinery, surveying, and drawing, had particular reference to the wants of the service, and when the selection was made, their names were submitted to the King. When the vessels, with their engines, and the other prepara tions at Liverpool were well advanced, the following instructions were issued for the guidance of the Expedition:— COPIES OF INSTRUCTIONS TO COLONEL CHESNEY, THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE EUPHRATES EXPEDITION. No. 1. Letter from the Duke of Wellington to the President of the Board of Control. Foreign Office, November 28, 1834. I transmit to you herewith a commission which the King has been graciously pleased to grant under his Eoyal Sign-manual to Captain Chesney, R.A., constituting and appointing him, with the rank of Colonel, on a particular service, to be Commander of the Expedition about to be undertaken for the establishment of a communication between the Mediterranean Sea and His Majesty's possessions in the East Indies, by means of a steam communication of the river Euphrates, in confor mity with the recommendation of the Committee of the House of Commons to that effect. I am at the same time commanded by the King to signify to you His Majesty's pleasure that an instruction to the following effect be addressed to Colonel Chesney:— As the object of the House of Commons in appropriating a large sum of money to be employed by His Majesty for the purposes of this expe dition was the promotion of the commerce and general interests of HisPREFACE. xi Majesty's subjects, it will be Colonel Cliesney's first duty to use every exertion to secure the success of the expedition in the shortest possible time, and always to bear in mind the necessity of making his arrange ments in such a manner as that their utility may be permanent in the event of his success. Colonel Chesney will further be careful to maintain the most perfect discipline and subordination among the persons who compose the expe dition. He will explain to them that His Majesty will view with the severest displeasure any conduct on their part calculated to defeat the objects of the expedition, whether arising from disagreement among themselves, or from an indifference to the habits and prejudices of the inhabitants of the country in which they are employed. It will be the duty of Colonel Chesney, and of every other individual, to conciliate to the utmost of his power the friendship and goodwill, not only of the authorities of the Grrand Seignior, but of the different com munities and tribes with whom he may have intercourse; to abstain from all acts calculated to rouse the prejudices of the inhabitants; to take no part in any disturbances or quarrels which may exist among adverse tribes ; and to avoid all acts of violence, unless in the last extremity, for the preservation of the lives of His Majesty's subjects. In short. Colonel Chesney is always to bear in mind that the character of the expedition is one of peace; that it is undertaken with the permis sion of a friendly power, without whose countenance and co-operation success cannot reasonably be expected; and that having for its object peaceful and beneficial interests, it is only to be conducted by peaceful means. Colonel Chesney will find His Majesty's Ambassador at the Porte instructed to afford him all possible assistance in the way of representa tion to the Turkish government, on any occasion where the intervention of that government with its authority is required. Colonel Chesney will communicate with His Majesty's Ambassador on all such occasions, and pay to his suggestions that attention which the position held by him at the Porte entitles him to expect. _ &gt; _ . „ Lastly, Colonel Chesney will report from time to time, for the infor mation of His Majesty's Government, the progress and prospects of the expedition. I have, &amp;c,, (Signed) Wellington. No. 2. Letter from Lord EUenhorough to Colonel CJiesney. India Board, January 24, 1835. Sir, It does not appear necessary to give you any further instructions for your general guidance in the prosecution of the object of the expe dition under your command, beyond those which you have already received from the Duke of Wellington. . m The minute of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty s Treasury, a 2Xll preface. which has been communicated to you, points out the mode in which you are to draw for the necessary funds. You have been already informed that His Majesty's Grovemment cannot apply to Parliament for any grant in addition to that of 20,000?. which has been so liberally made, for the purpose of ascertaining the practicability of navigating the Euphrates. You will always bear in mind that that is the one object of your expedition, and that scientific inquiries, however interesting, are not to be allowed to detain you. This caution is become the more necessary, since you leave England at a period subsequent to that at which it was first calculated by you that you would arrive at the mouth of the Orontes. Should you arrive at Bassora by descending the Euphrates, you will consider yourself to be under the command of the Bombay government. You will immediately on your arrival repair and refit your steam-boa% so as to be enabled to execute any orders you may receive. In the event of the season being favourable for the voyage to Bombay, you are at liberty to proceed at once to that port. This measure may possibly be rendered advisable by the consideration due to the health of the officers and men under your command. Such of the officers and men as the Bombay government may not deem it necessary to retain for the purpose of repairing the steam-boats, or of the further prosecution of the plan of navigating the Euphrates, will immediately proceed to England. Should the Bombay government decide upon prosecuting the naviga tion of the Euphrates, and the steam-boats be despatched for Bassora at an early period, that government is empowered to afford, to such of the officers and men as may desire it, the opportunity of returning to England by the way of the Euphrates, on the steam-boats. In the event of your finding it impracticable to convey the steam boats from the mouth of the Orontes to the Euphrates, and of your abandoning the project of descending that river on that or any other ground, you are at liberty to proceed with the steam-boats to Bombay. On your arrival at Bombay, you will place yourself under the orders of the Bombay government. Immediately on your arrival on the Euphrates with the materials of the steam-boats, you will communicate to the Bombay government every particular you may think necessary, in order to enable them to judge of the probable time of your reaching Bassora, and to take measures for sending a steam vessel, or a vessel of the Indian Navy, to meet you there, and convey instructions to you. I remain, &amp;c., (Signed) E llenborough. At a private audience, with which the Author was honoured at bt. James's, one week before the Expedition sailed, the Kingpreface. Xlll was pleased to add to his commands these expressive words: ' Remember, sir, that the success of England mainly depends ' upon commerce, and that yours is a peaceable undertaking, ' provided with the means of opening trade: I do not desire ' war, but if you should be molested, due support shall not be ' wanting. You are to write from time to time, through Sir ' Herbert Taylor, for my information.' The Expedition quitted England the 10th February, 1835, and having at length achieved the transport of the vessels from the mouth of the Orontes to Bir, though unfortunately not without the loss of eight men by fever, the descent of the Euphrates was commenced on the 16th March, 1836; the following being the allotment of officers and men:— EUPHRATES STEAMER.

It remains to say a few words respecting the Work, of which the two first volumes are now offered to the public. When the preparation of the Work was proposed by Sir John Hobhouse, President of the Board of Control, the Author felt that, irrespective of impaired health, the habits and ac quirements of a soldier were not exactly calculated to qualify him for so serious a task; but, it being observed to him that the task most naturally devolved on the Commander of the Expedition, he expressed his willingness to do his best; and he engaged to execute the Work in accordance with the outline then approved of—which was, that the account of the voyage should be preceded by a geographical and historical sketch of the countries with which the rivers Euphrates and Tigris have been intimately connected from the earliest times. The Author, though not unwilling to give the necessary time to the Work, expressed a hope that the Government would bear the expense of the publication; and he was informed that a liberal contribution would be made. After some solicitation on the part of Sir John Hobhouse, and Mr. Robert Gordon, then Secretary to the Board of Control, a grant of 1500/. was promised from the Treasury, and the expectation being also entertained that 600/. might be contributed by the India Board, as well as a like sum by the India House, it was presumed that the Work might proceed without a risk of loss. The Author consequently engaged to commence the task, as soon as he should have finished laying down a survey of the Euphrates and Tigris, for the use of the steamers sent out under Lieu tenant Lynch, of the Indian Navy. To embrace in their full extent the subjects of this extensive field of inquiry, and to treat them in a manner corresponding to the interest which has ever attached to the region described, may seem to be, properly, the task of an individual more per-preface. xv fectly qualified than the Author. Yet it is hoped that the two volumes now submitted to the Public will be found to contain a correct description of the countries lying between the Indus and the Nile, with a brief account of the leading events con nected with the nations by which they have been successively occupied. In the first, second, and third chapters of the first or descrip tive volume, the reader will find ample details of the four prin cipal rivers of Western Asia; the soundings, bearings, &amp;c., of two of them, the Euphrates and Tigris, laid down on charts, which in the case of the former river extend from Sumeisat to the sea; and, in that of the latter, from Mosul to the Persian Gulf. The charts in question, though only on a scale of a quarter of an inch to a mile, will, it is hoped, besufficient for the purposes of navigation; since it cannot be supposed that when full information is before the Public, two such noble rivers will be allowed to continue to expend their waters without being rendered every year more and more serviceable to man kind. I'ran in its largest sense, and its several provinces, are described in the succeeding Chapters from IV. to XII. In the last will be ^ound various circumstances which tend to ascertain the primeval seat of the human race. Chapters XIII. to XVI. are devoted to the geography and the social state of Asia Minor. Besides the results of the Author's own travels, he has availed himself of the journeys of others, together with the narratives and descriptions of ancient writers; and the mountain chains have been carefully laid down on the general or Index Map, Chapters XVII. to XXI., inclusive, treat of the climate and productions of Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine, &amp;c.; and in the same way those from XXII. to XXV. describe Arabia, fromXVI PREFACE. every available source of information, as well as from personal observations. Besides objects of natural history, the Appendix contains a list of the ancient and modern Arab tribes, as far as they could be ascertained; and a copious Index will enable the reader to find the various subjects contained in the first volume. The Author cannot but feel some anxiety about the second volume of the work, the subjects of which deserve to have been placed in more able hands. His first journeys during upwards of three years in the East, opened to him a wide field of inquiry; and, on his return, he availed himself of the vast stores of information contained in the British Museum. The extracts there made were found highly useful to the Expedition, when navigating the rivers which flow through lands memorable as the theatre of the great events recorded in sacred and profane history, and traversed by Cyrus, Alexander, Trajan, and Julian, as well as by the most renowned of the Muslim leaders. The stirring events, which, in ancient and modern times, are more frequently connected with the Euphrates than perhaps with any other part of the world, seem to be the first which require attention. In attempting this task, the Author had the assistance of Mr. Eassam, the principal Interpreter of the Expedition, for Arabic researches; and afterwards that of the very learned and industrious Aloys Sprenger, M.D., who, being both an Oriental and a classical scholar, was of the greatest service. During these researches, the resources of the British Museum, of the Bodleian at Oxford, and of the vast library at Paris, were turned to account; and the fifteen chapters, beginning with the dispersion of mankind, and ending with the establishment of the Turkish power in Europe, have been the result. In Chapters XVI. and XVII. the Author has endeavouredPREFACE. XVII to show the connexion at different periods between Asia and Europe, with respect to literature and science. The eighteenth chapter is devoted to ancient and modern commerce. The nineteenth describes the architecture, sculpture, &amp;c. of I'ran; and the twentieth the boats and hydraulic works of the East. In the volumes now introduced to public notice, authorities will be found for every statement which has been made; and in some instances circumstances have been confirmed by quo tations from other writers, even though they have come within the Author's knowledge. In concluding what relates to the Work itself, the Author should mention that the orthography and accentuation of Oriental words are the same as those which have been used by the Koyal Geographical Society. The Author is aware that such material changes as ' ' Akka ' for the well-known fortress of Acre, and Tarabuzun for Trebizond, are not without dis advantage ; but they will cease to be so, when the public shall be accustomed to them. For the system itself we are indebted to the Rev. G. C. Renouard, of Swanscombe Rectory, Kent, the talented Oriental scholar, by whom the Author has been assisted from time to time, especially in correcting the ortho graphy of the maps. Finally, in respect to the long delay of the Work, the Author requests the indulgence of the public while he relates the circumstances which have caused it. The illustrations selected by the Officers to elucidate the Expedition were put in hand at the earliest moment, with a clear understanding that two would be completed each week; but when nearly five years had elapsed, the Author was obliged to seek redress in a court of law, and a verdict was scarcely obtained, with the prospect of the immediate completion of the plates, when he was ordered to take the command of the Artillery in China. VOL. i, ^The alternative of postponing for an indefinite period the publication of the Work, or of going on half-pay, placed the Author in a state of painful embarrassment. He had incurred a serious outlay, which it was necessary to recover if possible; and he was most anxious for the publication of the Work, in furtherance of which part of the funds granted had been drawn from the Treasury; while, on the other hand, his position as a soldier of fortune would not justify him in making such a sacrifice as that of quitting active service, particularly as he had been serving without pay when commanding the Expe dition ; and neither the Minute regarding an increase of Army rank, nor the repayment of the expenses incurred previously to the Expedition, had been realized by Government: the hope also of assistance from the Board of Control and India House towards the expenses of the Work had been disappointed.^ The Author eventually set out for China; and about half the first volume being printed, he availed himself of the oppor tunity afforded by the leisure of the voyage to improve the remaining portion of the work. The recent success in deci phering the cuneiform character, has also led to the establish ment of some facts which served to elucidate several important points in the Persian history. The manuscript was sent to England in portions as it was prepared, and the printing of the first volume was completed. Some difficulties caused by the Author's absence prevented the completion of the Index Map and of the map of Arabia till his return; when, the difficulties being removed, the maps were finished, and the printing of the second volume proceeded. By an accident which it is unnecessary to dwell on, the * The East India Company had it appears declined the request, and the Soli citor of the Board of Control gave it as his opinion that their funds were not applicable to such a purpose.preface. xix Author, on his return to England, after an absence of four years, had the misfortune to lose, together with other valuable effects, a large portion of the manuscript; and the time since spent in making good the deficiency led to a still further delay in the publication of the Work. It is hoped, however, that these circumstances have rendered the Work as it now appears more worthy of the public favour than when it was first written; though the Author must still rely on their indulgence for the faults which may yet be found in it. In extenuation, he can only plead that he has used his utmost endeavours under the disadvantages of his situation; and he cannot reproach himself with having lost a day in the prosecu tion of the Work. Though the publication of the narrative of the Expedition will offer a more fitting place to acknowledge the many kind nesses experienced from public men at home and abroad, the Author cannot deny Mmself the grateful duty of expressing his sincere acknowledgments to Yiscount Ponsonby, when Her Majesty's Ambassador at the Porte, for his successful exertions and untiring support of the enterprise. And even for the portion of the work which now appears, a large debt of gratitude is due, and felt. To the kindness and industry of the Kev. R. Sheepshanks, the Author is indebted for the calculations of the valuable astronomical observations made by the astronomer of the Expedition, the late Lieutenant Murphy, R.E.; and also for giving the triangulations and other materials for the maps. On these much time and care have been bestowed by Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort and Mr. Walker, as well as by the gentlemen in the Hydrographer's Office. Without the assistance of these his fellow-labourers the Author could not have hoped to place before the public,XX PREFACE. in their present state, the fourteen maps which accompany this work. To Captain Washington, R.N., he is and has been largely indebted for aid and advice given to himself, as well as to the Ex pedition, from time to time; while, from the Rev. John Alcorn, of Trinity College, Dublin, Christopher Cookson, Esq., of St. John's College, Oxford, and from Lieut.-Colonel Stolzman, he has received great assistance in the verification of references. To the friends of his youth. Professor Narrien, of the Royal Military College, and Lieut-Colonel Sabine, R.A., he must also offer his warmest acknowledgments for various acts of kindness: every sheet of the work has passed through the hands of the former of these gentlemen.CONTENTS TO VOL.

A knowledge of these has been derived from Arabic manuscripts, as well as from local and other sources of information ; which, if not altogether new to our learned oriental historians, might have long remained unknown to the public in general, except VOL. I. B2 OBJECTS OF THE WORK. [CHAP. I. from the circumstances which led to their becoming objects of particular attention during the late Expedition. ^ Researchealn In that division of the work it is likewise intended to give 1830, &amp;c. a succinct account of my individual journeys and researches in the same countries during the years 1830, 1831, and 1832. And in the succeeding, or principal division, there will be given a detailed relation of the Expedition which was under- SL Expe ' taken 111 tlle y ears 1835 ' 1836 5 and 1837, in consequence of the results obtained from the researches previously made in that part of Asia. Labouring under the disadvantage of impaired health, and being doubtful of my fitness for the present undertaking, I should have preferred that the Government h^d permitted the materials to be placed in hands more able, and conse quently more likely to do them justice than mine; but, as this has been decided otherwise, I proceed to acquit myself, to the best of my ability, of the task which it has fallen to my lot to perform ; and I apply to it the less unwillingly, as it will afford me an opportunity of showing how the public money, as well as the other means so liberally placed at my disposal, were employed during the progress of the Expe dition. accompithed. 1 ma y ^e state, that through the unwearied exertions of the officers and men, every end attainable by human skill and industry was accomplished; and if, in the following pages, I succeed in doing justice to those who were placed under my direction, the reader will at least perceive that no commander was ever better supported throughout an arduous and novel enterprise. It is not surprising, therefore, that every diffi culty was successfully overcome; and, in recording with no common degree of gratitude, the support which was so cor- diaHy given to me, I am free to acknowledge that to me belongs the blame for whatever may seem to have been neglected, or in any way deficient, in the prosecution of the objects contemplated in the plan of the Expedition. But, leaving my conduct in this respect to be judged by the im partial reader, I proceed immediately to consider the extensive basins forming the principal water-courses of Western Asia.chap. i.] sources of the kizil-irma'k. 3 The elevated plateau 1 which extends from the base of Plateau of Mount Ararat into Northern Armenia, Kurdistan, and part w^eatrivers of Asia Minor, contains the sources of four noble rivers issuin £ from it- having their estuaries in three different seas ; and thus, from Armenia as from the centre of a great continent, giving an easy communication to the several nations of Europe and Asia. A reference to the Index Map will show that by following the Kizil-Irmak through Asia Minor we reach the Black Sea; from whence there are inlets to Russia, Austria, Turkey, &amp;c. In the same way the Aras, by terminating in the Caspian, opens several routes towards Great Tartary, as well as towards the rest of Central Asia and China; while the Tigris and Euphrates, with their numerous ramifications, afford abundant means of communicating with Persia, India, Arabia, and the continent of Africa. An extensive mer cantile intercourse is also maintained with the same regions by means of numerous caravans, which, since the time of Abraham at least, have traversed the countries watered by those four rivers. The Kizil-Irma'k. The most westerly of these rivers, the Kizil-Irmak, has Source of the its sources at two places, both of which are much farther ^ lzll ' Irma ^ to the eastward than they are generally represented to be on the maps. Of these sources, the most northern are on the sides of Gemin Beli Tagh ; 2 but the others are on the western slopes of the Kara-bel group, which separate the springs of this river from those of the Euphrates, 3 at a spot about 70 miles E.N.E. from Sivas, the seat of one of the local governments of Asiatic Turkey. The united waters of the several springs alluded to, having scooped a bed through sandstone and salt deposits, which occasionally form salt 1 The bridge over the Aras is 5478 feet above the Black Sea.—Mr. Brant's Journey, Vol. X.

P^ ace 3 the river is 60 paces wide. At three miles short of the city the stream sweeps northward, but again resumes the previous direction, running close by the houses; and from thence it tends towards the hills which form the abutments Anti-Taum S . of the Anti-Taurus. In this part of its course the river is augmented by several small affluents, so that at 55 miles W. by S. from the place above-mentioned it has a breadth of 100 yards, and is crossed by a handsome bridge of 17 arches. The onward course continues as before in the general direc tion of W. by S. ; and, after passing about 15 miles distant from Kaisenyeh on the northern side, it receives a tributary which runs into it from the north; and again, a few miles westward, another on the opposite side, called the Kara su, a considerable stream, which comes from the Taurus, and skirts the southern slope of the lofty Arjish Tagh (Argseus). The bed of the Kizil Irmak westward of Siyas is almost always narrow and deep, being hemmed in by heights composed of soft, pliable, and soluble materials. 4 Below Yarapason it flows through a country alternately of volcanic rocks and saliferous deposits: and here it receives the Tatlar river, besides its greatest southern tributary, the river of Akajik, or Argustana; which seems to correspond with the southern Halys of Pliny. 5 This junction takes place near the beautiful vale of Parnassus, on entering which the Halys is repelled by the granite rocks of Sari-bulak Tagh; 6 and m 38° 41' N. latitude, it has attained its most westerly point, 7 being about 400 miles from its source. Here it makes a short bend towards the east, and then runs nearly north through a fine open valley, generally covered with saliferous deposits, between the Baranli Tagh on the 1 Such as Tuz-li Goli, Tuz-li Hisar, &amp;c. 2 Mr. Brant's Journey, Vol. VI.

The Halys receives in this part of its course many small tributaries, such as the Kalichi su (Sword River), or the river of Kirshehr, which flows from the Boz Tagh, the Kerwan Serai Tagh, and the Kara Goz hills; 1 and is probably the Cappadox river of The Cappadox Pliny. 2 The river now runs nearly N.E., between the Enkun ofPliny ' (Angora) and Sivas districts; and at Cheshni Kopri, 3 a remark able mass of sienitic rocks oppose themselves to the progress of 1 the water, by forming a partial barrier at the foot of the Begrek Tagh. Having overcome this obstacle by passing a succession of rapids, the river runs nearly north through a hilly country and into a great valley, in which, on the eastern side, it receives the Deliah su (Mad Water), or river of Yuz-Kat, with several minor streams. At the termination of this valley the river enters into one more spacious, called Osman- jik, in which it receives, from the eastern side, the small tributary, Kerchak-chai. Just below Osmanjik the river turns N.W., and enters the heart of the Kush Tagh by a narrow and deep ravine, everywhere hemmed in by steep and lofty acclivities, having abrupt cliffs above them. It opens for a moment immediately north of Hajji Hamsa, to receive, on the western side, the waters of the Devrek-chai. 4 This stream, The Devrek which seems to be the ancient Doros, has its source below the tHbuteries. rude and hilly district of Karaiiler and Kara Viran (Black Ruin) ; a country of basaltic and igneous rocks, which extend across from the slopes of the Kush Tagh to those of the A1 Goz Tagh. Several tributary streams here conspire to fertilize the land and enrich the villages, especially in the vale of Tosiyah, which is one of the best cultivated and most pro ductive in Asia Minor, 5 abounding with gardens and the country-houses of the principal inhabitants. After receiving the Devrek-chai, the Kizil Irmak enters the almost impracticable glens of the A1 Goz Tagh, below which, within a very circumscribed space, it receives also, 1 Ainswohh's MS. 2 Lib.

I. from the west, another affluent, called the Gok su (Blue River). This latter river, which represents the ancient Amnias, has for one of its tributaries the stream called the Dadah, whose waters enter it after having fallen into the short river of Kas- TheK^i tamuni a few miles below the city of that name. The valley of the Gok Irmak, the Kara sii of Kinneir, runs N.E. for six miles, and then turns E.N.E., opening towards the main river; it contains numerous villages, which are surrounded by vineyards, gardens, and groves of poplars. At Ilik Tagh the valley becomes so narrow as only to leave room for the water to flow through. But after passing Boi-Abad it begins to widen, and runs nearly east; being in this part of its course fertile, well wooded, and covered with villages, which are at short distances from one another, and occasionally hidden by lofty and precipitous promontories. The average width of the Gok su is from half a mile to a mile ; its course is charac terized by abrupt windings and long reaches between wooded hills and rocky precipices; occasionally luxuriant vegetation surrounds its villages, and the country exhibits a succession oi varied and beautiful landscapes. 1 This river has but few tributaries of importance, and it eventually falls into the Kizil Irmak just where the latter overcomes an almost im penetrable rocky barrier. It ultimately gains its own smooth wlfejis bed of allu vium, over which it flows with diminished velocity 8 mtothe^.t to the N.E., till it enters the Black Sea near the town of Bafirah, 40 miles west of Samsun, after a course of upwards of 700 miles. The Kizil Irmak, however, is not available for the purposes of navigation, in consequence of the rapids which occur in passing through the several chains of moun tains, the Kirk Delim, Kush Tagh, A1 Goz, and Ada Teppeh; as well as from the existence of volcanic rocks in its bed at certain places. The elevation of the Kara Bel, or Paryadres, at the springs of the river, is 5800 feet above the Black Sea'; and that of the springs themselves, at Koch Hissar, is 4000 feet. Such is the general course of the Kizil Irmak, or Halys, the noblest river of Hither Asia: it traverses Lower Mr. Ainsworth's MS. 2CHAP. I.] COUNTRY BORDERING THE HALYS. 7 Asia almost the whole way from the sea of Cyprus to the Geography of Euxine, and was once the boundary of the kingdom of the Haly8 Croesus on the east. Herodotus 1 says, that the empire of Lydia was divided from Media by the river which comes from the Armenian mountains. It runs at first through Cilicia; then between Matiena on the right and Phrygia on the left; afterwards it passes the lands of the Syrians, having Cappadocia to the right and Paphlagonia to the left. And, according to Arrian, 2 it divides the Sinopians from the Armenians. Its name 3 is derived from the salt country through which it passes. The Turkish name is, however, Kizil (Red), such- being the colour of the soil throughout much of its course. Pliny calls it an immense river of Asia Greek Minor; 4 and Strabo says that its waters are of a salt and of bitter taste ; 5 which is particularly the case in the salt districts of Sivas and Yarapason. The country bordering on the Halys is, for the most part, but thinly peopled, and only partially cultivated; chiefly owing, as it is said, to the apprehension entertained that the produce may be consumed by the hordes of Kurds who inhabit the mountains in summer, and descend to the plains in winter, accompanied by their numerous flocks; but more probably for want of a commercial outlet. Here the produc tions of a warm climate are found, such as melons, figs, pome- Asia Minor granates, grapes, &amp;c., as well as the dye called yellowberry. 6 near the Halys ' There is, on the whole, such a fair proportion of the neces saries of life, that the people are at their ease, notwithstanding the forced loans exacted by the Kurds, and the other imposi tions to which they are subject. Throughout a distance of about 100 miles E.N.E., from Yuz Kat to Tokat, the country is a succession of plains, separated by low hills. This part is well peopled, well cultivated, 7 and enjoys a moderate 1 Lib. I. c. 72; also V. c. 52. 2 Arrian, Periplus 8 In Greek, 'AXvg. —Strabo, lib. XII., p. 35. 4 Lib. VI., c. 2. Lib.

The last great plain before reaching Tokat contains about 70 villages, and produces an incredible quantity of grain. 1 Between Tokat and Tarabuzun there are several consider able towns, and numerous villages; and the whole district forms a beautiful, fertile, and prosperous portion of Asia Minor. 2 T he A ras, or A raxes. Source of the Towards the north of Armenia we have the second river, Iviver Araxes namely, the Araxes, with its numerous tributaries. This river, which at its commencement, owing to-its many affluents, bears the Persian appellation of Harharas, springs from the side of the Bin Gol, or ' Mountain of a thousand Lakes,' about 30 miles south of Erz-Rum, and nearly in the centre of the space between the eastern and western branches of the Euphrates. 3 Its course, from its first spring near Jebel Seihan, is almost N.E. for about 145 miles through Armenia; when it turns eastward, being then near the frontier of Kars: this proximity continues for 110 miles j the river in all that extent running parallel to the frontier, and eventually touching it for an instant at the southern extremity, where it is joined by its The^rpab- first large tributary, the Arpah-chai' (the Harpasus), which comes from the north, and forms the eastern boundary of Kars. On receiving this stream the Araxes leaves the pro vince, taking a south-easterly and tortuous course, between the foot of Mount Ararat and Erivan, opposite to which city the JCara su runs into it from the north ; and a little farther east it is joined by the Zenani, which also comes from the north, and washes Erivan. The general direction, after rounding Ararat, continues as before, S.E., the river separating 1 Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. VI. Part II p 219 2 Ibid., p. 220.

It receives on the right side, in this part of its course, the southern Kara su, which comes by a north-easterly The Kara su bourse from the same district, and the Ajl-chai, also from tributary - the south; whilst on the opposite, or northern side, it is joined by the Zanghou, the small Arpah-chai, the northern Kara su, the Abaran, and, at the northern extremity of Nakh- chivan, 1 by the great Arpah-chai, which forms the western limits of the province. Being thus augmented, it flows round the southern border of Nakhchivan, for nearly a distance of 38 miles, to the fortress of Abbas abad; and here it receives a third Arpah- chai, in addition to two other streams, viz. the Nakhchivan- chai and the Atendja-chai. 2 As the country is here moderately level, the course of the Araxes continues to be tranquil as far as the village of Djulfa, where it enters a rocky defile extending about 14 miles ; and, having forced its way over a succession of cataracts, it finally enters the level country with a noise which is heard at the distance of an English mile. The Aras now bends to the N.E. for a distance of about 35 miles, along the district of Urd-abad, where it is augmented by the Ghilan-chai, the Oustoukon-chai, the Nenate-chai, the Ailisse-chai, and, finally, the Urd-abad-chai. 3 In quitting the latter district the course of the Aras becomes much more tortuous, and it takes the general direc tion of N.E. between the provinces of Karabagh and Kara Tagh, till it enters the extensive plain of Moghan. A few The southern miles short of this tract it is joined, on the southern side, by ^ ara ?u ' a considerable tributary, formed by two branches, viz. the Kara su, coming N.N.W. from the mountains of Ghilan, and the Adhar, which falls into the former branch a few miles before it enters the Araxes, after a lengthened course 1 Aperfju des Possessions Russes au-dela du Caucase, sous le Rapport statis- tlque, ethnographique, topographique, et financier; execute et public avec le consentement supreme.

The course which it first takes is a little east of north; in this direction it flows through the province, and almost to the capital, being augmented by numerous tribu taries which enter it on both sides. Near the town of Akhaltskhai the river takes, for about 70 miles, a north-easterly direction, when it runs E.S.E. an additional distance of 50 miles, to Mitzkheta, where it is joined by a large tributary coming in a S.S. easterly direc tion from the Caucasus. Ten miles below the junction the main trunk passes through the city of Tiflis, where its ordi nary width is 93 yards, which, in the season of floods, is augmented to 233 yards; and, at the latter period, it has a depth of 27 feet. Here the river bears the name of Mtwari, and it abounds with salmon and other fish ; but it requires to be filtered previously to being drunk. 2 Below Tiflis its course is S.E. for a distance of 115 miles through the province of that name; in which it is increased by the rivers Martkoby, Its tributaries. Dygom, and Vera. Lastly, on arriving at the borders of Karabagh, it is joined by a great stream formed by the Alazani and Yori rivers, whose courses, from the slopes of the Caucasus, are nearly S.E., or almost parallel to the Araxes as far as their point of junction, which takes place within two miles of the latter. The Kur now pursues a south easterly course for about 120 miles between Erivan and Shirvan ; from the last of which it receives numerous streams, Pliny, lib.

The waters of the Cyrus and Araxes, at length uniting, The Kur joins form one river, which makes a bold sweep northward, and the Araxes - again another southward, through the plain of Moghan; when, after having run a distance of about 110 miles, measured along the windings, it falls into the Caspian Sea by three mouths, being navigable for boats up to the point of junction. Strabo 1 makes the Araxes larger than the Cyrus, which, he says, augments the former; and at one time it had a separate channel to the sea, merely communicating with the Cyrus by means of a canal. The name of the former river is supposed to be derived from Araxes, son of Polusis, who was drowned in it. 2 Moses Choronensis calls it Erashes; and other oriental writers give it different terminations, as Arashe, Eaksi, Eris, Araksis, Ancient names Arras, Eas, Eus, Arsinas, Cras, and Arras; but Xenophon oftheAraxes - thinks it came from ar-ax, or holy water, and that it was dedicated to the sun. In very ancient times it was called Eaktos, 3 from a mercantile colony which came from the east and settled on its banks. Owing to its rapidity, it is navigable only for a short distance; but it no longer justifies the ex pression of the poet; 4 for Shah Abbas constructed over it, at about 60 miles north of Tabriz, a stone bridge, which is a very fine specimen of architecture: there is a second, of seven arches, each double, 5 of beautifully light construction, by which I crossed the Aras at Koprf Keiu; 6 and there is another at Hasan kal'eh, of two arches only.

[CHAP. I. The numerous windings of the Aras appear to give about 830 miles from its source to the sea; and of this length, 560 miles extend through the rich valleys of Eastern, or Persian Armenia. It is proper to notice that there is, in the tract of country of which we are speaking, the source of another river, which is also of the first class, although considerably smaller than the others. This is the Jorak, or Acampsis, which rises about 30 miles north of Erz-Rum, and is, according to Mr. Brant's description, ' one of the largest rivers of Armenia.' It unites the waters on the western and northern sides of the mountains containing the sources of the Kur, Aras, Arpahchai*, or Harpasus, and the Western Euphrates, which serve as drains to the valleys on the opposite sides of the chain. Rafts come down the Jorak, from Atvin to the sea, in three days; and sometimes, though rarely, track up against the stream in eight or ten ; but, from all that I could learn, the river is not navi gable for boats, on account of rapids and rocks. The windings of the river Jorak seem to give a course of about 200 miles; it bounds Colchis to the west; and is, in all probability, the Bathys, which, according to Pliny, 1 is a river of Colchis. 1 Lib.

Although mucli has been done by D'Anville, Rennell, Rich, and, more recently, by Ormsby, Lynch, Brant, and others, in investigating the origin and course of the Tigris, there Numerous still remains a vast field for research concerning this im- ot the portant river and its tributaries : these last, within an equal extent of territory, are probably more numerous than those of any other river with which we are acquainted. The Tigris has, in Central Armenia, two principal sources, both of which spring from the southern slope of the Anti- Taurus, near those of the Araxes and Euphrates, and not very distant from that of the Halys. It was called Diglah by the Chaldeans, and the designation applied to it in the Scriptures is Hiddekel, a name which it bears at the present day among a large portion of the people living near its banks. 1 The western branch rises at a spot which is about 20 miles The West#™ westward of Arghani Ma'den, and near 10 southward of the Hiddekel. centre of the Ghuiljik lake: 2 its course is north-eastward along the deep valley at the foot of the elevated ground of Kizan ; 3 and, after having continued in the same direction 1 Viscount Pollington also found this name in use.—Vol. X.

Within a few miles of that place it receives the addition of a considerable stream coming from the S.W., or in a direction almost parallel to the main branch. A little below the mines in that district the stream bends rather eastward of south, pass ing at a short distance on the east side of the town of Arghani, and receiving about the middle of this part of its course a tributary coming from the Taurus. The course below Arghani continues in the general direction of S.S.E. to the environs of Diyar Bekr, 1 where it makes a semicircular bend to the eastward. Within the space thus formed the modern town just mentioned has been built, at a short dis tance from the right bank of the river; from which it is separated by rich gardens, containing white and black mulberries, prunes, apricots, peaches, figs, and gooseberries, together with large forest trees; also ashes, poplars, and willows, interspersed with balm, madder, and other plants. 2 Di^r Bekr. T ^ e towi1 stands upon an elevated rocky range, stretching from the citadel, at its north-western extremity, towards the S.W., in the shape of a boat, and is about 200 yards from the river at the nearest point. 3 The citadel is on a precipi tous mass of volcanic 4 rock, to which the walls of the town are joined. These are high, well-built, and strong, being flanked by 72 towers, which, like the walls, and even the houses, are constructed of lava, 5 mixed with the ruins of ancient buildings. The walls inclose a space of which the circumference is about five miles. 6 The houses are fiat-roofed and two stories high, the lower one of stone, and the upper of clay; and the buildings rise in stages, like a succession of 1 The Tents or Dwellings of Bekr, the Kara Amid of the Turks; also sup posed to be the ancient Amida; by Pocock, the Dorbeta of Ptolemy ; and Mr. Ainsworth considers it to be the Tigranocerta of the campaigns of Lucullus. 2 Voyage de Constantinople a Bassora par Sestini.

The situation of Diyar Bekr is admirably calculated for that of a great commercial city, 4 and nothing appears neces sary to revive its ancient importance but the removal of the chief cause of its decline ; namely, the insecurity of its com mercial communications with Syria, Asia Minor, and Kur distan, and with the estuary of the Shatt el Arab. Although the course above described is not long,, the Tigris has already collected a considerable body of water, which spreads out to some extent on entering a small level tract opposite the town of Diyar Bekr, where it is about 250 yards wide in the season of floods ; 5 but it is hot here used for any other purpose than, occasionally, to float down rafts of timber from the mountains. 6 Below Divar Bekr the Tigris contains several islands. Its The Tigm it , . . -i • -i below Diyar banks are thinly peopled, and the country about tnem is only Bekr. partially cultivated; but the pasture grounds are rich and well suited for the visits of the nomadic tribes which come occasionally to the river from the neighbouring countries.

A few villages still appear here and there, but formerly this plain was cultivated in every part, and covered with towns, some of which contained from 400 to 500 houses, and more than one Christian church. 2 After continuing nearly 40 miles in the same direction, the Tigris receives a tributary from the northern slope of Mount Masius. 3 After this junction has taken place, the main branch makes a sweep northward, and then eastward, for about 18 miles, to 'Osman Keiu, where it is joined by the eastern, or second TijS^ 6 ' 11 g rea t branch of the Tigris; which is formed by the union of different smaller branches, springing from the sides of Ali Tagh, the ancient Niphates. The principal of these branches rises in the latter range, at a short distance from the Murad-chai, and takes a S.W. course along a spacious mountain valley, going in the same direction towards the Tigris, till, at about 25 miles from its spring, it receives, near Myafarekin, an abundant stream, which rises at a short distance westward of that place. Myafarekin. The town stands at the foot of a range of mountains, and is about half a mile square. Its houses, which are flat-roofed, are chiefly in a ruinous condition; and there are some mosques of simple architecture. It is surrounded by an ancient wall of massive construction, and about 25 feet high, with square towers, to flank it, at intervals of 100 yards from each other. Myafarekin was the capital of Sophene before the time of the Moslems, 4 and the river, passing about 20 miles eastward 1 Niebuhr, Vol. II., p. 326. ^ Brant's Journey, p. 209, Vol. VI.

The direction of the Tigris, after the junction of these two branches, is nearly E.S.E., through the Kurdistan range; and at Hisn Kei'fa, about 35 miles from thence, it receives a considerable stream, coming from the foot of Mount Masius, near Mard'm. It passes from thence through a tract of country which, probably in consequence of the number of 1 MS. translation of Abu-l-feda, by Mr. Rassam. VOL. I. D18 THE BITLIS AND KHARZAN TRIBUTARIES, [CHAP.

Q n the opposite side, and about 29 miles lower than the last mentioned tributary, the main stream is entered by the Bitlis-chai', probably the second Nicephorius of Xenophon, 1 who appears to have regarded it as the principal branch. It rises at Bash Khan, on the southern side of Jebel Nimrud, at a short distance westward of lake Van, and its course from thence is nearly south, to the town of Bitlis. Sixteen miles southward of this place it is joined by a more considerable stream, called the Bakiyah-chai, which comes into it from the west. These waters unite at the foot of the Sir Sera, a high mountain, forming part of the Ali Tagh range; from whence the deep and rapid river thus formed, takes a south-westerly direction to a spot eight miles N.W. of Se'rt, where it receives the Kharzan-chai. 2 This river comes from the west, through the mountainous country of the Kharzan Kurds, 3 the ancient Arzanene; 4 in which it receives a more western tributary, the I'lijeh su, coming from the north of Khazero. After this increase, the Bitlis-chai is about 50 yards broad and knee deep, as it sweeps westward, at the distance of six or seven miles from Se'rt; it then takes a southerly course, and falls into the Diyar Bekr branch, some distance above Til. 5 At this small but remarkable village, 6 the Tigris is joined by another considerable stream, the Buhtan-chai, which, by its course from the slopes of the Algerosh Tagh, would appear to represent the Centrites of the ten thousand. 7 As this river passes within four miles of the eastern side of Se'rt, it is like the Bakiyah-chai' (on the other side), known as the Se rt su, although neither stream touches that town; and 1 The other Nicephorius being a tributary of the Euphrates. 2 Mr. Ainsworth's MS. 3 Visited by Mr. Brant.—See Vol. X.

The main branch of the Khabur, which will be noticed presently, appears to have been confounded by Rennell, Kinneir, and others, with the so called Se'rt su ; and nearly a similar mis take occurred in the case of Mr. Rich, who was informed that the Eastern Tigris rises 11 hours beyond Julamerik, and passes Se'rt, where it is difficult to ford, even at its lowest; Comparison and is, in the early part of its course, a much more consider- branches! 66 able river than the Diyar Bekr branch. 1 Now, however, it is ascertained, that the Buhtan and Bitlis are not only smaller rivers, but the course of each is much shorter than that of the great western branch. The windings of the Bitlis-chai, for instance, appear to give only a distance of about 100 miles to the point of junction; whilst the Diyar Bekr river makes a sweep of 275 miles in coming thither, and carries a breadth of 150 yards nearly waist deep. 2 Soon after the junction of the Buhtan-chai, the Tigris Course of the passes E.S.E., through a mountainous ravine, into the valley of Chelek, in which there is a ferry and a large village of the same name, defended by a strong, handsome castle, built on a rock. 3 A little lower it traverses another bold ravine, and then makes a great bend westward round the peninsula of Findik; forcing its way between limestone precipices, similar to those of the Frat near Rum Kal'ah. The river then sweeps E.S.E., and again takes a more southerly course to the castles and gardens of Fenik; below which it makes its way through Jebel Judi at the celebrated pass of Xenophon. 4 Having cleared the latter, the Tigris winds to the E.S.E., and again west of south, till, at about 60 miles below the junction of the eastern and western branches, it washes Jezi- reh-ibn-'Omar. 5 The island is covered with modern buildings, which, generally speaking, are in a ruinous state; but portions of the bridge constructed by the minister Noureddin over the two branches still remain.

At about 23 miles S.E. of Jezireh, measuring along the windings, the Tigris receives the Khabur. Of this stream very little is known at present beyond the mere fact, that the main branch rises about one day's journey to the N.E. of Julamerik, and takes a westerly direction from thence towards Zakho ; receiving in this part of its course several tributaries from the mountainous countries lying southward and north ward of its course. One of those from the south comes from the neighbourhood of Amadiyah; and this stream, which is noticed by Tavernier and other travellers, has been, till recently, taken for the Khabur itself; but we now know that the latter has its source a great distance to the northward: and by its presumed distance from Julamerik it would seem to be one of the streams described as the Se'rt river. The main trunk of the Khabur, having received this acces sion, pursues a south-westerly course to the town and island of Zakho. At about 15 miles below this place, the Hazir-su comes into the Khabur by a southerly course from Jeliel Judi, and is then apparently a large stream. 4 After the junction this river takes the name of Pe'ishabur, 5 and pursues nearly a W.S.W. course till it enters the Tigris near the Roman Catholic village and ferry of Pei'shabur. It appears, however, to carry into the Tigris a much smaller body of water than the great stream bearing the name of Khabur which joins the Euphrates below Deir. The Tigris pursues the previous direction, that is, nearly S.E., almost to Eski Mosul, which it passes by a western Memoires sur rArmthiie, Vol. I. 2 See Ainsworth's Journey in the ' Expedition.'

Mosul is a walled city, with eight gates, standing on the right bank of the Tigris. It contains about 20,000 families, Turks, Christians, and Jews, who still carry on some com merce with Kurdistan, Diyar Bekr, Baghdad, and other provinces, chiefly by caravans. On the left bank, both above and below Mosul, are the ruins of Nineveh, the walls of which city extend about 3100 yards along the river, 2 and nearly the same distance towards the interior. At about 28 miles by the river, and 20 miles in direct distance south, 12° east below Nineveh, is the celebrated bund, or dyke of solid masonry, called Zikru-1 awaz, or Nimrud, which crosses the bed of the river ; 3 and at seven miles lower Bunds of there is a dyke, called 2ikr Ismail, 4 similar to the former, but in a more dilapidated state. At the distance of about two miles and three-quarters S.E. from the first dyke, and about four miles and a half N.N.E. from the other, are the ruins of Nimrud, or Ashur. 5 These, which are still known to the people by the name of Al-Athur, 6 are, at the present time, less considerable than those of Nineveh, being only about four miles in circumference; they are terminated at the N.W. angle by a great pyramidal mound, 144J feet high, and 777 in circumference, 7 which was once coated with bricks. Some of these were found by Mr. Rich, who states, that they are about the same size as those of Babylon, and are inscribed with arrow-headed characters. 8 Here Mr. Ains- worth also discovered the foundations of some massive walls, 1 MS. of Mr. Ainsworth. 2 For a further description of Nineveh and McSsul, the Mes-Pylae of Xeno- phon, see the ' Expedition.' 3 Ormshy's MSS., and Rich's Kurdistdn, Vol. II., p. 129. 4 Ormshy, and Rich, p. 352. 5 Probably the Larissa of Xenophon.—Rich, Vol; HVP- 1 29- 6 Ibid., p. 131. 7 Ibid, p. 132. 8 Ibid, p. 130.22 THE BUNDS OF NIMRUD.

Derawish, the principal village, was, according to tradition, founded by Nimrud; it is only one quarter of a mile from the great mound, and is watered by the Seikh Dereh stream, into which the Karadash dereh falls before it reaches the Tigris. 2 But as both are dry during the summer season, it is possible that the two great bunds already mentioned may have been constructed to raise the surface of the Tigris, so as to give a supply of water to the city at that time of the year, by means of canals or aqueducts. Canals still exist in some places along the Euphrates, at the extremities of similar walls, and they have been evidently constructed there for the purpose of conveying water inwards to the fertile, alluvial plain, spreading from the Tigris to the lower part of the Zab. At about 12^ miles below Zikru-1 awaz, and at the southern extremity of the district of Mosul, or Ashur, the greater Zab 3 enters the Tigris. Source of the The Zab, probably the Zerbis of Pliny, 4 is formed by several different streams running through the Jawur moun tains, and converging on the southern slope of the great Kurdistan chain. The main branch has its sources at Koniyeh, Karasun, and Kashen ; all three of which places are on the slopes of the Sar-al-Bagh range, in about 38° 30' N. latitude, and nearly midway between lakes Van and Uruimyah. The trunk formed by the junction of these streams has at Kanda Kilissa an elevation of 6,800 feet above the Black Sea ; 5 and is aug mented by several smaller affluents as it winds, in a southerly 3 ^ en - x - 12 - 2 Rich, Vol. II., p. 133.

At 37° 19' N. latitudeifccmmeto it bends to the S.W., along a fine valley, in which are many villages and delightful groves, with varied and abundant vegetation. After passing near the southern side of the town and castle of Julamerik, the capital of the Chaldean Christians, it flows onward, separating the high mountains on the northern, and the still loftier peaks of Jawur Tagh on the southern side. It is joined by the Berdizawi, or western branch, near the village of Kiyau in Warendun, in about 34° 5' N. latitude, and 43° 26' E. longitudeand the space between these two arms near their confluence is occupied by the huge mountain mass called Mekannah. 2 The Berdi zawi, which bears the local name of the Little Zab, is under stood to spring from the slopes of Erdish Tagh, some miles southward of the eastern extremity of lake Van; from whence it winds through limestone formations in the general direction of S.S.E. to the point of junction. In the latter part of its course it is augmented by the Mar Hannan, and several other streams. On both sides of the river the country is well cultivated, and contains numerous villages, which communi cate with each other by means of bridges formed of twigs twisted together with much ingenuity. 3 Soon after a large tributary from the N.E. enters the Berdizawi near the village Tributary near of Leihun, the river throws itself, with a cloud of foam and spray, over the succession of limestone terraces, which form at this place a great and striking waterfall ; 4 and, a little lower, it joins the eastern branch. After the junction of the two great arms, the Zab takes the direction of the western branch; that is, S. of E., till at about 12 miles E. by N. of Amadiyah it sweeps round to the east, and soon afterwards receives a moderate-sized stream, which comes by an easterly course from beyond that town. From hence the general direction of the trunk is rather N. of E. along the great valley between the Tura Tobi and Zibar mountains on the north, and those of Zibeiri on the south, as far as a point 1 Ainsworth's Visit to the Chaldeans: p. 47, Part I.

II. 10 miles westward of Rowanduz, where, being joined by a considerable tributary, it suddenly sweeps round to the BowlSz near W.S.W. This tributary, which, up to the recent visit of Mr. Ainsworth, had been mistaken for the great Zab, is formed by numerous branches springing from the slopes of the Keli Shin and Kendilan mountains ; the principal of these branches, the Sidaka, receives the others a few miles north of Rowanduz, after flowing W. S.W. through a lime stone bed. The united waters wind southward to that town, and from thence, on being joined by the Rowanduz river, flow W. and W. N.W. into the Zab; having previously, at about two miles and a half below this remarkable strong hold of the Kurds, received a river, which, flowing through deep ravines and secluded dells, comes into it from the limestone chain to the S.W., called Sar Hassan Beg. 1 The main trunk now, under the appellation of the great Zab, winds onward W. S.W. through the valley, and between the vil lages of Kendil and Kasroki; about 12 miles below these The^Akraand places, in the same direction, it receives the Akra (a tributary from the N.W.), and, on the opposite side, the Bastorah Chai. The course of the river from hence is nearly S.W., till it falls into the Tigris, short of which, about midway, it receives the river Khazir, or .Bumadus, a considerable affluent formed by the Ghomar Su and other tributaries, all springing to the southward of Amadiyah. After this accession to its waters, the Zab continues in the previous direction till it enters the main river below Senn with a deep stream 60 feet wide, and it forms at this place of junction a small pebbly island. 2 About 12 miles below the confluence of the great Zab there is a ford, which is opposite the saintVtomb called Sultan Abdu-llah; 3 and about six miles lower, but on the opposite, or right bank, are the hot springs and bituminous fountains forming the stream called Kear; 4 below which large forests occupy the banks for the next 20 miles. 5 At 13 1 Mr. Ainsworth's Visit to the Chaldeans : p. 10, Part I.

II.] LESSER ZAB, OR CAPRUS. 25 or 14 hours, or about 32 miles below the Zab, and near the ruins of Kal'ah Shirkat, theUr of the Persians, a river, Called The Asas Amir, the Asas Amir (which had not been noticed by any traveller previous to the descent of Lieutenant Ormsby in 1832), enters the Tigris on the western side, after a long course from the Sinjar hills. From hence, after a course of about 28 miles in the general direction of S.E., and skirting the Hamrin hills, over a succession of small rapids, the Lesser Zab, 1 or Caprus, enters the Tigris with a deep stream 25 feet broad, 2 having pursued a course from Altun Kopri in a south-western direc tion, or parallel to the greater Zab. The main branch rises The about 20 miles S.W. of the northern extremity of lake Uru- Lesser Za ^ miyah; then, after a course to the S.E. of about 30 miles, it turns abruptly S.W., and about 20 miles onwards, in the latter direction, it receives five different affluents from the valleys of the Kurdistan mountains. 3 The trunk thus formed by these different streams continues in the same direction as before to Altun Kopri, or the golden bridge. The small town bearing that name contains about 400 houses; it is built on a peninsula, which becomes an island during the flood season, and contains, in addition to the dwelling-houses, several grain stores and wharfs, at which last the rafts, descending thus far, are discharged, and others Skins to cross or descend the Tigris. 1 Or Zdh el Soghaer. 2 Ormsby's MSS. 3 Major Rawlinson's Map: Vol. X.

T rr i ai // o / • i i Cesser Zab, or Altun feu, is augmented by a considerable stream coming from Koi-Sanjak, a town of 1000 houses, 2 and distant about 40 miles north, 85 miles east: 3 from thence it becomes navigable by rafts. 4 At their junction the Tigris is about 500 yards broad; 5 and a little below there is a kind of cataract, called Kelab, where the descent is so rapid that the river appears as it were to run down hill. 6 This place is much dreaded by the people when descending in boats; but it does not seem in reality to offer any serious impediment to the rafts so frequently passing between Mosul and Baghdad. The Euphrates steamer not only passed over this difficulty, under Lieutenant Lynch, but also proceeded as high up as the bund opposite the ruins of Nimrud. The river now bends eastward of south, between Tel Truliyah on the east and Kal'at Jebbar on the west, preserv ing its width, and forming several islands; and, at about 24 and EiJBurech m ^ es f rom the Lesser Zab, the canal of Is-haki leaves on Canals. the west side, and that of El Burech on the east, 7 just after the Tigris has succeeded in forcing its way through the Hamrin hills at a spot called El Fatt'hha. 8 Here, on the left bank, there is an abundant supply of sulphur; and, directly opposite, naphtha rises in great quantities from the bed of the river; it appears in black spots on the surface, but gradually vanishes in the water. The raft- men say, that Alia has caused the two hills of Hamrin to be at continual war; and that their strife forces the naphtha to bubble up from the bottom of the river. Here the people cut wood for the Baghdad market. 9 The river continues in the same general direction, or a little east of south, without receiving any other tributaries worth mentioning, as far as Tekrit, which is below the Lesser Zab, at about .43 miles from the Burech canal. 1 Rich's Kurdistdn, Vol. II., p. 12. 2 See Mr. Ainsworth's Journey in the 4 Expedition.'

Tekrit stands on tlie right bank, and is remarkable for a Town of castellated building upwards of 200 feet bigli, with a vaulted Teknt ' staircase leading to the Tigris ; l tlie building is surrounded by a ditch, which was once filled from the river. A little below the castle, and also on the same bank, stands the modern town, which is now reduced to about 600 houses of burnt brick. 2 The ruins cover a considerable space below the southern side of the town, and form about it a large crescent, extending for some distance to the north of the citadel. This place takes its modern name from Tekrit, the daughter of Wayal, sister of Beckr; and its castle, they say, was built by Sabar, son of Ardechir. 3 Below Tekrit, the aqueduct, or canal of Is-haki (Khiyat-al- suk) leaves the Tigris, taking a course southward, and nearly parallel to the river for some distance ; it afterwards joins the river near Baghdad, between which place and Tekrit it was followed at intervals by Dr. Ross. 4 This is the river Al- Is-haki, which was dug in the days of Al-Mutwakkel by his general Is-hak, to water a part of Irak. 5 At about nine miles south, 8° east of Tekrit, is the saint's tomb, called Imam Dur, which Mr. Rich thought to be the place where Jovian constructed a bridge for the passage of his army; and which, he adds, might also be the Dura of Nebuchadnezzar. At about a mile and a half lower down are visible the remains of a cut, called Nebi Suleiman, which. Canal of according to tradition, was the work of Solomon ; 6 its course has since been traced by Dr. Ross, and found to be the bed of an extensive canal. This canal, which passed by the eastern side of the ruins of Sammara, must, from its direction, have crossed the Suther Adhim stream, coming from Kerkuk; it must also have crossed the Dokhala canal, as well as, subsequently, the Diyalah itself; and thus it may have conveyed a large portion 1 Rich's Kurdistdn, Vol. II., p. 141. 2 Ibid. 8 MS. translation of Abu-l-fedd, by Mr. Rassam. 4 Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. IX.

II. the of the waters of this river into those of the Kerkhah. 1 If this opinion be well founded, some of the difficulties connected with the ascent of Nearchus, the admiral of Alexander's fleet, would be removed; and the probability that the Kerkhah was once increased in this way is strengthened by a belief which pre vails throughout the country, that the bed of the lower Diyalah, of its present size at least, is of comparatively recent formation. At about one mile and a half below the canal commence the ruins of Eski Baghdad, which join the northern portion of those of the ancient city of Sammara. 2 The latter was a celebrated place, not only during the Roman wars, but also in the time of the Khaliph Motassem, who, in the ninth century, made it the seat of his government. At about 12 miles below the supposed work of King Solomon, there is also on the left bank another canal, called Nahr al Resas ; which takes its departure at the ruins of Kaim. 3 This is one of the heads of the famous Nahrawan, which waters Sala and some other villages/ Its bed may still be traced in a direction parallel to the Tigris, as far as Kut-el-Amarah, or, according to some, to the river Kerkhah itself. Just below Sammara, on the opposite bank, is the bed of the Dujei'l, or Little Tigris. This cut, according to Abu-l-feda, went from thence and watered the land near Baghdad. 5 It was met with in several places during the examinations of Dr. Ross; but, owing to the neglect so prevalent under Moslem governments in the present day, the dike, or bund, at the entrance 6 has fallen into a state of decay ; therefore,' instead of constituting an abundant supply, the water carried along this channel only occupies a small part of the ancient bed, and this to a moderate depth. 7 1 In a paper lately sent to the Geographical Society by Dr. Ross, it is stated that, according to the accounts of the Arabs, this canal goes to Hawiza.

II.] KADISIYEH AND THE MEDIAN WALL. 29 This cut takes a S.E. direction through cultivated lands, Effects of where its effects, even in its present diminished state, are most Imgatlon - striking in fertilizing the grounds and fruit gardens surround ing the villages; this is particularly the case near the pros perous village of Sume'ichah, situated about 17 miles S.E. from the commencement of the canal. Here irrigation has changed a tract which was previously barren, into one possessing the fertility ascribed to this region, by He rodotus, whose account has too often been placed amongst the legends of fiction by those who make the produce of ordinary countries a standard for estimating that of Meso potamia. Immediately after the ancient derivation of the Dujeil, the main stream sweeps round so as to take an eastern course, passing a little way southward of El Sanam, 1 or Nabga, -and also of the extensive Sassanian ruins of Kadisiyeh, which were Ruins of once washed on the opposite side by that which now appears ? adlsiyeh- to be a secondary branch or feeder of the Nahrawan. 2 Opposite the ruins of Kadisiyeh there is still visible an extensive dry bed, lying in a S.E. direction from the right bank of the main river, which runs towards the east as before. This ancient bed was met by Dr. Ross in several places under the name of Shatt-Aidha, and was traced into the Tigris at shatt-Aidha. about 17 miles N. by W. of Baghdad, having in its course cut off the bend made by the present river to the eastward. A belief has generally prevailed that the Tigris once flowed in this channel; but the space between the river and the said bed being described by Lieutenant Lynch as having been an island in former times, 3 it can scarcely be doubted that this was merely a derivation, either natural or artificial, from the main stream. Near the commencement of the Dujeil is one extremity of the celebrated Median wall, which proceeds from thence S S.W.

It is from 35 to 40 feet high, with towers at intervals of 55 paces from each other along its western side; and there is a ditch towards the exterior 27 paces broad. It is called Chalu, or Sidd Nimrud, and is built of the small pebbles of the country imbedded in lime of great tenacity. 1 This interesting relic of the olden time had been previously passed farther westward by Mr. Fitzjames in 1836; and, subsequently to Dr. Ross, by Lieutenant Lynch, who followed it for some miles in 1838. After a course of about 15 miles eastward from the Duje'il the Tigris makes a deep double bend, so as to pass close to the site of Opis, in the form of the letter S; and at the eastern extremity of the bend it receives the river Adhim. The centre of ancient Opis appears to have been in the bend, above the Adhim, and also in the angle formed by the junction of the two branches of the Nahrawan, 2 of which the lower one, or Nahr al Resas, comes from Kai'm, 3 and the other, the Nebi Suleimdn, already mentioned, from below the extensive ruins of Imam Dur. 4 The latter was, no doubt, excavated to feed the principal branch, by commanding a supply of water higher up at certain seasons of the year. The main trunk of the Adhim rises in the mountains north of Kerkuk; and, after a southerly course for some distance, it receives the Tak, a tributary coming from the N.E.; and, a little lower, the Tuz-Khurmati, coming by a westerly direction from the Karadagh range. 5 The course of the Adhim continues to run southward through the Hamrm hills, at the foot of which, on the southern side, are the remains of a remarkable bund, which was constructed of the most solid materials 6 at a remote period. Its object was to raise the water so as to supply the canal of Ratham, 1 Dr. Ross's Journey to Al Hadhr: pp. 445, 446, Vol. IX. Part III.

The latter is cut on the western side in order to irrigate the country lying S.S.W.; after which the remainder of its waters appear to have been conveyed into the Nahrawan, east ward of Sammara. 1 Towards its confluence the river is but 15 yards wide, and 20 inches deep, 2 and at one time of the year the water is still lower; in fact, Lieutenant Lynch ascer tained from the natives, that it is dry during from three to five months. 3 After continuing an easterly course for six miles below the Adhim, the Tigris bends S.S.E. for six more, to the sandy shoals near Dokhala; 4 just above which village the Khalis enters the Tigris. This canal is cut from the Diyalah through the district of Khalis, from whence it takes its name, and which contains 62 villages. 5 After a sweep to the westward, a little below Dokhala, the river takes a tolerably straight course for 39 miles by the stream, or 20 miles S. by W. direct distance, from that village to the spot where the minarets of the city of the Khaliphs rise from both banks amidst extensive clusters of splendid date- trees. This remarkable city, the classic scene of the Thousand and city of One Nights, is unequally divided by the river, two-thirds being Bagh(lad - on the left bank, and the remainder on the right, or Mesopo- tamian side; the two divisions are connected by a bridge of boats. The town is fortified by a high brick parapet wall, flanked at intervals with bastioned towers, and surrounded by a ditch; the citadel, which is a respectable work, is situated at the north-western extremity. The bazaar, built by Daud Pasha, is one of the finest in the East, and is well stocked with home and foreign manufactures. Some of the mosques are also striking, but the rest of the buildings show, as usual 1 MSS. of Dr. Ross, Journey in 1834. 2 Ibid. 3 Vol. IX.

[CHAP. II. on the exterior, either dead walls or ruins; but when viewed from a distance, and especially from the river, the luxuriant date groves and rich gardens, contrasted with green domes and graceful minarets, present a rich and attractive appearance. Previously to the plague, which commenced its ravages in 1830, there were 110,000 inhabitants; but the number now scarcely exceeds 65,000. The Tigris may be considered as having an average width of 200 yards from Mosul to Baghdad, with a current, in the high season, 1 of about four miles and a quarter per hour. The country is highly cultivated, from Mosul to Nimrud, on both sides of the river ; 2 but, from the latter place to Tekrit, all cultivation nearly ceases ; and it is but partially found in the tract along the river between Tekrit and Baghdad. The Tigris is navigable for rafts at certain seasons 3 from the bridge of Diyar Bekr to Mosul, a distance of about 296 miles. Below the latter place it is more or less so throughout the year; 4 and the descent to Baghdad is performed with such ease and speed that the river is known by the expressive name of the cheap camelier. 5 Large rafts supported by 200 6 or even 300 inflated skins are much in use for the transport of goods ; and, when the merchants are on board, a small room is raised on the raft in order to give shelter from the sun and rain. During the flood season the voyage is performed in three or four days ; whereas at another time it requires about fifteen days. 7 At five miles below Baghdad the canal of Saklawiyah, or Isa, brings, during the season of floods, a portion of the waters of the Euphrates into the Tigris from a spot about six 1 In March, when Mr. Rich descended. 2 Rich's Kurdistdn, p. 129. 3 Colonel Shiel's Journey: Geographical Journal, Vol. VIII.

II.] THE RIVER DIYALAH. 33 miles above the castle of Felujali. This canal crosses Mesopo tamia in a direction generally eastward, passing, in the latter part of its course, near the great mound of Akar-Kuf; and it is, without doubt, one of the most ancient commercial communications in the world. It may not, however, be out of place to remark here, that these two important streams, might be connected together by opening a canal of only 18 miles in length, from the eastern extremity of the Isa to the mounds of Muhammed on the Euphrates. Such canal would be passable at all seasons of the year. At 21 miles below the termination of the Saklawiyah, in the direction of S., 28° E., The Diyaiah the Diyaiah brings into, the Tigris a vast body of water, TigS, e which is obtained by the junction of several great branches, all comins: from a considerable distance. On account of the extensive range of country traversed, as well as of its indi vidual importance, and because it probably coincides with the ancient Gyndes, this great stream seems to deserve a separate notice. The principal branch, called the Abi Shirwan, rises on Rise of the the northern side of the Kuh-i-Sungur, about 40 miles west ^ 1 ®^ irvvan of Hamadan, nearly as many N.E. of Kirman-shah, and at nearly two degrees east of Sulei'mamyah. 1 Its direction is west, inclining to north for about 40 miles, then N.W. for about 40 more, that is as far as the ruins of Darnah ; 2 and it receives in this part of its course numerous petty streams from the mountains of Shahie and Avroman. About 10 miles beyond Darnah, in the same direction, it its course ami takes a westerly course of 20 miles, through the mountains, to Gundar, where it receives the river of Chumi-Zamgan, which rises near Galwarah, in the Guran country, at about 70 miles distance towards the S.E. Immediately after this increase the Abi Shirwan forces its way through a narrow gorge (without even sufficient space for a footpath along its bank) into the plain of Semiram, where it is joined by a considerable affluent formed by the waters of the Taj-rud and Salm. These streams unite about eight miles to the north 1 Major Rawlinson : Vol. IX. Part I., p. 28, Journal of the Royal Geo graphical Society. 2 Darnah of Ptolemy, ibid., p. 29. VOL. I. F34 TRIBUTARIES OF THE DIYiLAH. [CHAP. II. of their junction with the main branch; the Taj-rud comes about S. W. from the plain of Shahri-zur, and the Salm nearly S.E. from the neighbourhood of Suleimaniyah. They have long been considered as the principal feeders of the Diyalah, although their united waters scarcely amount to half of those which form the AM Shirwan; and the latter, as we have just seen, rises about 120 miles eastward. The main river now takes a south-westerly direction, still preserving the same name. Below the junction of the Sulei'maniyah river, it receives from the Zagros, on the east side, two considerable streams; the first at 35 miles from that junction, and the second at about 25 miles farther on. The Abi Shirwan now runs nearly south for about 30 miles, when it receives the Holwan. This most interesting river, as we learn from Major Rawlinson's examination, is formed by two considerable branches ; the northern, or Abi Holwan (the Elwan of Rich), 1 rises on the western face of the greater chain of the Zagros, about eight miles north of the pass called the gates of Zagros; and bursts at once into a full stream, which is swollen by many copious additions as it pursues its course nearly W. by S. down the romantic and beautiful glen of Rijab 2 to Zohab; and onward to the remark able ruins at the chasm and pass of Sar-Puli-Zohab. 3 After receiving at Mulla Ya'kub, six miles from the latter place, the Abi-Derah stream, which flows from the S.E. past the ruins of Dera, the Holwan pursues, a westerly course to Kasri Shirin, 4 where it turns southward; and at a distance of 10 miles farther in this direction it is joined by the southern branch, called the Abi-Gilan, which comes from beyond the village of Gilan, a distance of about 40 miles towards the N.W. The direction of the united stream, which still preserves the name of Holwan, is a little south- 1 Vol. II., pp. 261 and 263. 4 Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. IX. Part I., p. 33.

Below the confluence just mentioned, the Tigris becomes The Tigris even more tortuous than it has been in its previous course DiySah! from Baghdad; for it now makes, not merely simple bends, but actually a succession of deep convolutions, in the level country which it traverses, till its waters and its name are lost in those of the Euphrates at Kurnah. The windings of the main trunk incline rather westward, m Kesm. or towards the Euphrates, till the striking Arch of Chosroes Tak Kesra. announces that the stream is washing the western side of the remains of Ctesiphon, and a little lower on the right bank those of Seleucia. Both of these ruins have been greatly diminished by the gradual encroachments of the river, as well as by the effects of time itself. Below the crumbling vestiges of these once noble cities shatt ai Dijiah. the convolutions incline towards the eastern side ; thus gra dually increasing the width of Mesopotamia. They bear the well known appellation of Shatt al Dijiah as far as Kut el f 2SHATT EL HAl. [CHAP. II. Bifurcation of the Tigris; amarah, a small town on the left bank nearly midway between Baghdad and Kurnah, being about 178 miles by water from the former city, and 97J miles directly S.S.E. from the latter. Nearly opposite to this miserable specimen of an Arab town, a bifurcation takes place; and it may be remarked here, that the Tigris, instead of receiving, as before, an addition to its waters from the Euphrates, now sends a considerable portion to the latter river, by means of the canals above and below Baghdad; through these canals, however, the waters only pass during the season of floods. The greater of these branches continues its easterly direc tion, under the new name of Shatt el 'amarah, till it joins the Frat; 1 whilst the smaller turns off nearly at a right angle towards the heart of Lower Mesopotamia. The latter branch, or Shatt el Ha'i, has a breadth of nearly 150 yards, and takes a southerly direction to the mounds called Ne'ishaget Wasit, where it forms two branches. One of these, called the Bu ji Heirat, follows a circuitous course, by the old fort of Tesaine, to Tela Tendhiyah, where it is rejoined by the other branch, called the Shatt el 'Amah, 2 which flows near the modern Wasit. 3 It is not navigable in this part of its course; but the western is so, and is, in consequence, the regular passage. These united streams take the direction of S. 22° E., under the name of Sub-bil. At about 20 miles below the junction just mentioned, the trunk of the Hai sends off a canal, called Be Dukhan, tpwards the eastern side; and also another in the opposite direction, to Shatrah, about 11 miles lower, and of the Hai. At the tombs of Hamzah the main stream of the Hai again divides into two branches; of these, the most northerly, or that which is navigated, enters the Euphrates opposite to the custom-house of A1 Arkah; and five miles lower, near the village of Abti Sof, which is 78 miles by the river from Kurnah, the smaller branch also falls into the Euphrates, 1 ' The principal,' says Abu-l-feda, ' is Mara (woman), and it waters all the land on the west side of the Tigris. The remainder flows into the other river (Euphrates).'—MS. translation by Mr. Rassam. 2 Or the Wanderer. Wasit el Hai. i j-CHAP. II.] SHATT IBRAHIM AND THE LOWER TIGRIS. 37 after a course of about 140 miles from Kut el 'amarah. The banks are inliabited, and, owing to the inundations and the facilities of irrigation, the country is easily cultivated at those places. It is navigable during eight months of the year, and at that season the canal is preferred by the boatmen to the passage along the main stream, on account of the heavy dues exacted by the Bern Lam Arabs. 1 The Tigris appears to preserve its original size, notwith standing the diminution of its waters in consequence of the canal diverging from it: in all the remainder of its course, which is in a direction E. by N., its average width is 200 yards. A few miles below Kut may be traced the ancient bed of a branch, now dry, running in a S.S.E. direction through s the ruins of Wasit, and onwards from thence, in the same direction, under the name of Shatt Ibrahim, till it enters the Euphrates, about midway between the Ha'i and Kurnah. This appears to have been the bed of the river described as passing between the two towns of Wasit, which were in former times connected by a bridge of boats ; 2 and the state of the ruins on each side, as well as the size of the ancient bed, confirm the opinion. 3 It is, however, probable that this was merely a previous derivation, which gradually became dry after the waters had taken the course of the Hai, on the banks of which the people of Wasit then settled, at the spot now bearing the same name. The course of the Tigris below the Hai is, as we haveo,^ already observed, E. by N., and it preserves that W- under the name of Shatt el 'amarah, for about 28 miles; it then turns S. by W. for an additional distance of 32 miles, or as far as a spot close to Imam Gharbi, where it has reached its greatest distance from the Euphrates ; this point being 95 miles in a direct line S. 22° W. from a bend near Ummu-l- Huntah, on the latter river.

Derivation of from Imam Gharbi, a derivation, called El Hud, quits the main stream on the eastern side, and runs into the Kerkhah, near Hawizah. 1 The direction of the main branch now tends S. 34° E., and numerous irrigating cuts are sent out from it on both sides. At 10 or 11 miles below Imam Gharbi the river changes its character in a very remarkable manner; instead of forming extensive sweeps, the channel becomes deep and narrow, with a number of short, abrupt bends. The tract about the canals is marshy, and resembles that of Lamlum, to which also it corresponds in point of latitude; it may, therefore, be a part of the celebrated Chaldean lake, which, at the season of floods, extended not only across Mesopotamia, but also to some distance eastward of the Tigris, so as to receive the waters both of the Kerkhah and the Karun. After passing for about 40 miles through marshes, and coming near the tomb of Ezra, the river resumes its former size and character, as it winds in the general southern direction, to Kurnah; which place is 232 miles from Kut el 'amarah by the windings, and ^ of the 144 i direct distance. The whole course thus briefly de scribed may be estimated at 1146 miles, which is little more than half the length of the sister stream, the Euphrates, from the sources of the latter to their junction at Kurnah ; but it discharges more water, owing to the numerous tributaries which it receives on its eastern side; among which may be particularly noticed the two Zabs, and the river Diyalah. There are, however, as we have seen, only two feeders of any moment on the western side, throughout the long dis tance from Diyar Bekr to Kurnah. SnfoftL A C0nside rable increase of the river Tigris takes place Tigris. during the rains of November; subsequently it decreases and swells irregularly at intervals, till the different feeders are bound up by the frost and snow of January, in the Kurdistan mountains. This serious check retards for a time the swelling of the river; therefore its permanent rise, like that of the Euphrates, does not usually begin till the middle of March ; Mr. Rich's pilot had gone along this branch to the Kerkhah.—Rich's Kurdistdn, Vol, II., p. 171.CHAP. II.] DESCRIPTION OF THE TIGRIS. 39 it is at its greatest lieight between the middle and the end its velocity, of May, when its velocity is 7 - 33 feet per second; and the discharge at Baghdad, in the same time, is about 164,103 cubic feet. After this time, the river falls with more or less regularity and inequality, till the middle of June. The large boats are not, however, obliged to diminish their cargoes till the month of August; between which time and the month of November, when the river is again at the lowest, they should not draw more than four feet of water. There is an active commerce along the Tigris, between Basrah and Baghdad, by means of the large country boats, which go in fleets; and above the latter city it takes place chiefly by means of rafts from Mosul. In addition to what has been ascertained during the recent Authorities Expedition, I have availed myself of the information given by consu tet ' Strabo and Pliny ; the Journeys of Tavernier and Sir John M'Donald Kinneir ; the descent of the Tigris by the Right Honourable John Sullivan in 1785, and that of Lieutenant Ormsby, I. N., in 1830 and 1832; and Mr. Ainsworth's two Journeys. But, as the reader will perceive, I have made great use of the map, and other valuable materials, kindly furnished me by Mrs. Rich; taking advantage, at the same time, of Lieutenant Lynch's map in the Ninth Volume, Part III., of the Royal Geographical Journal, to fill up blanks, and to compare with other authorities. I am likewise greatly indebted to Major Rawlinson and Dr. Ross. From the MS., as well as the printed notices of the latter pains taking and persevering gentleman, I have extracted much that was very useful in fixing some important points near the river; such as the site of Opis, the head of the Nahrawan, as well as the great bund of Adhim ; and I have pleasure in adding, that the bearings he has given are found to be very correct. Lieutenant Lynch has followed the whole line of the Tigris, from its source to Baghdad; but we have not had the details of this descent; nor have those of another journey which he made along a part of the Diyalah been as yet sent home.—See p. 471, Vol. IX.

The river now about to be described rises at no great distance from the shores of the Euxine, and, in its course to the Indian ocean, almost skirts those of the Mediterranean; under such circumstances as these, we cannot be surprised to find that the Euphrates at one time formed the principal link connecting Europe commercially with the East. Its historical celebrity has excited in its favour an interest superior to that which has been felt for any other river; and it may be reasonably expected that when its advantages shall be fully known and duly appreciated, it will rise to a high degree of political and commercial importance. In a range of more than 1780 miles from its eastern source, this river may be said to unite three great and important seas; which, without it, would be destitute of any water communi cation with each other, while the varied productions of the intervening territory would, in a great measure, be lost to the rest of the world. This classic stream, which, having been the scene of our labours, will form the main subject of these volumes, has two great sources in the Armenian mountains, and it bears the name of Frat 1 in its whole course from the most northern 1 For at—Forath, in the Hebrew Perath, or Phrath, meaning to fructify, or fertilize.CHAP. Ill,] SOURCES OF THE FRAT. 41 of these sources, which is situated in the Anti-Taurus, 25 miles N.E. of Erz-Rum. The branch from thence takes a westerly it 8 first direction at first, and, after passing within seven or eight tIlbutarle8 • miles of the capital of Armenia, it is joined, a few miles farther west, by two small feeders, coming also from the north; then, after a course of about 40 miles farther to the W.S.W., it receives a third, coming from the west, near Kather-Kopri; and again, a little lower, but on the opposite side, and coming from the Judi Tagh range, the Mahmah Khatun, which is its first large tributary, and runs into it through the plain of Terjan. 1 From hence the river, which is now a considerable stream known by the name of the Kara su, makes a circuit, winding through the mountains and over rapids, into the plain of Erzingan ; 2 through which it flows in the same general direction, close to the town of that name. This place contains about 3000 houses, and is situated at the Erzingan. western extremity of the plain. 3 Here the Kara su enters a narrow, difficult defile, which continues as far as Kemakh, a mountain town, situated about 26 miles S. 55° W. of Erzin gan, and consisting of 400 Turkish, with 30 Armenian houses, which are singularly placed amidst gardens, on a slope, ascending from the river. At the eastern side of Kemakh, a large tributary, called The Komer the Komer su, enters from the westward, beyond the town of Devrek, after a course of 70 or 80 miles, with a sufficient body of water to carry timber, which is after wards floated along the Kara su for the use of Kebban Ma'den. 4 Immediately after the junction of this branch, the mam trunk passes under a wooden bridge, and enters a deep chasm in the mountains, through which its united waters have forced their way. 5 1 Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. VI.

[CHAP. III. The Frat The stream continues nearly S.W., after passing the defile, Anti-Tamus. as f ar as the ferry of Khostti, three miles below; and, near the village of Pash-tash, it enters a vast rent in the moun tains, with precipices on both sides, rising to the he iht of 1000 or 1500 feet. After passing this chasm, the river makes a short bend to the S.E., but soon resumes the general direction of S.W., and flows into the deep valley of Egin. The mountains rise to about 4000 feet on each side of this singular fissure, which is so narrow that it is crossed by a bridge between lofty limestone precipices, seeming to overhang the town, and, as it were, to threaten its destruction. 1 Egfn * Below Egin, a town of 2700 houses, on the right bank, the river maintains the general direction S.W. through the mountain valleys, till it arrives at about five miles short of Kebban Ma'den ferry and the lead-mines, where it is joined by the Murad-chai, or su, being, at this point, about 270 miles from its source.

It rises on the southern slope of Ala Tagh, a mountain about 9000 feet high, 2 and takes a general N.E. course for about 24 miles, to Diyadin, a small town west of Bayazid, and situated on one of the more elevated branches of the Taurus, not very distant from the highest point at Ararat. 3 After passing Diyadin, this great branch of the Euphrates takes a W.N.W. direction nearly as far as Molla 'Osman, where it receives a feeder coming from the west. Here the main stream pursues a S.W. course along the great valley formed by the Dujik range on the north, and the Supin and Nimrud Taghs on the south; receiving several streams coming from the high grounds on each side.

Erz-Rum, and 20 north of Mush, it receives a small tributary, called the Char Buhur su, coming, by a S.E. course, from the slopes of the Bin gol Tagh range, which attains, at its culminating point, an elevation of about 9000 feet. This accession of water gives a new direction to the main stream, 1 which now winds towards the south for about 20 miles (or in the direction of Mush), until it is turned by the offsets of the Nimrud Tagh at 10 or 12 miles short of that place; and, after running a few miles nearly in a westerly direction, it receives from the Nimrud Tagh and plain of Mush, a little way west of lake Van, another river, bearing the often repeated Turkish name of Kara su. Its sources are in the crater of a volcano, over the lips of which it bursts in two streams. These immediately unite and form a considerable river, which, after a W.N.W. course of about 30 miles, passes within three miles of the northern side of Mush, 2 a town which contains 1200 houses, at an elevation of 4692 feet above the level of the Black Sea. 3 Murad (the river of desire) pursues a new direction, W. by junction of the 8., after the junction of the Kara su, and continues to wind Mur^d-'su- along the valleys nearly parallel to the Dujik Tagh, from the slopes of which range it receives several considerable streams. Amongst these may be particularly noticed the Gunhik su, coming into the main trunk from the north, about midway between Mush and Palu, and likewise the Perez su, which enters below the latter place, after a S.W. course of consider able length. Near Palu the Murad sweeps round, and takes a W.N.W. direction, until it joins the western branch, two hours above Kebban Ma'den, having previously made a tor tuous course of a little more than 400 miles through a mountainous country, over an irregular, and, generally speak ing, a rocky bed.

Below the ferry of Ma'den, where it is 120 yards wide 2 and very deep, the Tauric chain, against which it still presses, forces the river to incline rather more southward; and, at about 15 miles in this direction from the ferry, it receives a tributary, called the Chamurli su (Mud Water), coming from the west, through a narrow and well cultivated valley; and again, seven miles farther on, another, and still larger, called the Tokhmah su (Boundary Water) ; which latter has been supposed to be the Kuramas, or Melas of the ancients, and to have given its name to the district and town of Melitene (Malatiyah). This stream comes from the Gok Dille mountains on the slopes of the Anti-Taurus; it flows past the town of Gurun, and is, on approaching the populous and interesting town of Derendah, a considerable stream. From the latter place its course is nearly eastward to the Euphrates, into which it enters below the towns of Aspuzi and Malatiyah ; near which it is suited for boats of light draught. 3 Stpfe The town of Malatiyah contains about 2923 families, who are accustomed to spend the five winter months only at that place, and the remaining seven months at Aspuzi 4 After receiving the Tokhmah su, at half a mile beyond the Eis Oghlu ferry, the Murad enters the main chain of the Taurus, and, after struggling onwards in various directions for about 1 Lib.

Ill,] THE RIVER BECOMES NAVIGABLE. 45 45 miles, among the recesses of these mountains, bounded by The Euphrates lofty precipices, and constantly interrupted by rocks, as well as small rapids, it finally forces a passage through the Taurus; leaving to the right, or north, the higher part of this chain. Until lately it had been supposed that this portion of the river was not in any way navigable ; but, during the cam paign of 1839, it was the uniform practice of Hafiz Pasha to embark his stores on rafts, and float them down at least to Sumeisat ; 1 from whence the stream continues navigable, 2 without any serious interruption, for a distance of 1195J miles to the sea. After clearing the difficulties just alluded to, the windings Flows near continue to be short and abrupt, between low, steep hills; Sumeisa t- and the river takes the general direction of W. S.W. as it passes near the eastern side of the ruined walls of Sumeisat, having received on each side, in the previous part of its course, several inferior tributaries. The distance thus far, by the windings along the western branch, is about 450 miles, whilst that by the larger branch, or Murad, is about 586 miles. 3 Ferry at Sume'isat. 1 MS. of Mr. Ainsworth's Journey from Angora to Bir. 2 Puis a Samosate ou il commence a devenir navigable jusqu'a Baghdad.

[CHAP. III. Rum Kai'ah. After passing the Zeugma of Sumeisat, the river winds through a succession of swelling hills, having a pasture country on each side, with partial cultivation around the villages, which are scattered here and there along the banks, within an extent of 51 miles by the stream; and 40 miles in a direct line, S. 69° W., to Rum Kal'ah. The castellated building which gives its name to the spot, stands on a high hill of limestone formation, overhanging the right bank, and having its base washed by an abundant stream, which enters the Euphrates from the west, through a very rocky valley. Along the tributary, and on the right side of the hill rising from the main trunk, stands the town, which may contain about 900 miserable houses, covering the sides of the hills encircling that on which the castle is so judi ciously placed; to command and protect one of the ancient Zeugmas. Immediately below the town the river changes its direction, and inclines rather eastward of south for a distance of 15 miles, through a more cultivated country, when it approaches the ruined castle of Graum; which is but 80J miles from the sea at Bay as. The distance from Graum is 10 miles E.S.E. to ancient Birtha, the Bir, or Bireh-jik of the Turks; which place is 26| miles by the river, and 16 miles directly S. 28° E. from Rum Kal'ah. Castle of Bir. The position of the castle of Bir resembles that of. the one just noticed, except that it rises from the left bank, so as to command the passage of the river on the opposite side. The town contains about 1700 houses, which cover the valley, the bank of the river; and also the side of the hill northward] as well as eastward of the castle. It is surrounded by a substantial wall, which, like the castle, is partly of Turkish architecture, and partly of that of the middle ages ; it is also in a most convenient situation, on the great line from Aleppo to Urfah and Diyar Bekr. Bir is one of the most frequented of all the passages into Mesopotamia, and about 16 large passage-boats are kept at this place, in a state of repair, for the use of the caravans, which occasionally number 5000 camels.CHAP. III.] DISTANCE FROM BIR TO THE SEA. 47 The bed of tlie river at this place has been ascertained to Heigiitofthe be 628^ feet above the level of the Mediterranean Sea, 1 from above the Bir ' which it is distant 140 miles and 26 chains by our waggon Mediterraneau. road, or 133 miles in a direct line, to the mouth of the Orontes; whilst the Persian Gulf, towards which it now begins to incline a little, is distant 1117 miles; thus giving the trifling fall of rather more, on an average, than six inches per mile, 2 from Bir to the Persian Gulf, supposing the latter to be on the same level as the Mediterranean. 3 The general direction below Bir is a little E. of S., and it winds between chalk hills of moderate elevation for 39 miles, or 31J S. 27° E. direct distance, to Kal'at en Nejm. 4 At 14 miles, and again at 9 miles, above this celebrated Arabian observatory, erected by Almamun, the Euphrates receives, on its right bank, the Sajur, a considerable tributary, which comes from the Taurus, and after passing at no great distance from the northern side of the ruins of Membij, islands formed separates into five short branches ; thus forming four islands g^ h r e nver 1 By a line of levels begun by Lieutenant Murphy, and completed by Mr. Thompson, from the port of Suwei'dlyeh to the river Euphrates. 2 The Danube, according to George Rennie, Esq., F.R.S., has, between Ulm and Passau, an average slope of two or three feet per mile. From Passau to Pesth the slope is about six inches per mile. 3 The Red Sea is 36 feet higher than the Mediterranean ; and it is probable that the Persian Gulf is rather less. 4 Castle of the Star.—Mr. Rassam.48 JABER, THAPSACUS, RIVER BELIK, ETC.

At 48|- miles below Kal'at en Nejm, or 34 miles in a direct line S. 8° W., is the castle, and near it the ruins of Balis, the Barbalissus of the Romans, once the port of the ancient Beroe, and the P'thora of Balaam. 1 Here the river seems finally to abandon the struggle it had hitherto maintained to reach the shores of the Mediterranean, from whence it is distant 123 miles, in the direction through Aleppo to Suweidiyeh, and 118 miles through the same city to Iskanderun; the distance in a direct line, S. 70° W., being 101^- miles. directiwf of the Tlle course of the stream from Balis to the striking ruins Euphrates. of Jaber castle, the Sela' Midbarah of Benjamin of Tudela, 8 is 29 miles, or 22^ miles direct distance S. 68° E. From hence, passing the ferry of Hammam (the ancient Thapsacus), the windings give 42 miles, or 26 miles direct distance, N. 82° E., to Rakkah ; the river flowing through a fine pasture country, having extensive Bedouin flocks feeding on its prairies, but no permanent villages.

After a tortuous course of 80 miles, or S. 69° E., 441 miles direct from Rakkah, the great stream forces its way in a most remarkable manner through the chain of hills running along the western side of Palmyra, and from thence towards Sinjar. At this spot, after flowing round a large wooded island, the river makes an abrupt bend, nearly at a right angle, pursuing its course in a smooth channel, 250 yards wide, and seven fathoms deep, 'between the beetle- browed rocky precipices of Balbi.' 4 These rise abruptly to 1 Pethor, Numbers xxii. 5.—See Benjamin of Tudela, by A.

At two and a half miles below this range, the river passes between the two ancient and deserted marble-built towns of Zelebi, or Chelebi, which indicate one of the great commercial passages to Palmyra, at the period of the prosperity of the latter city. From Zelebi to Deir, the distance by the stream is 57J miles, or 26 miles S. 38° E., direct. This ancient town contains about 1000 Town of Deir. houses, covering an elevated, conical hill, which rises from the right bank, opposite to the eastern extremity of an island, situated between the river and an artificial canal. The latter has been excavated, for the purpose of cutting off the sweep made here by the Euphrates to the eastward; and it is so well adapted for navigation, that both our steamers passed through it without any difficulty. At 27^ miles by water, and 18, S. 42° E., direct distance, Somc^of the below Deir, the Khabur enters the Euphrates, after a lengthened course. The principal source of the branch which gives its name to the river (the Araxes of Xenophon 1 ) rises in the Abd-el-Aziz range, near Ras al 'ain, and at a spot called Al Zahriyah (flowery 2 ) ; situated one day's journey westward from Mardin, and not very far from Urfah. It takes a general direction south-eastward, and is augmented by numerous streams; ' such,' says Ibn Haukal, ' as are not to be found in all the land of the Moslems; for there are more than 300 pure running fountains. 3 The principal stream, the Jakhjakhah, has its sources at the southern foot of the Karajah f agh, 30 miles north of those given by Abu-1- feda; from whence it makes a winding course, till it falls into the Khabur in the latitude of Sinjar. 4 The more western tributary, which appears to be the ancient Mygdonius, rises in the hills 5 beyond Nisibin, and flows past the eastern side of that 1 Anab.

Tlle P lace where this supposed bifurcation takes place is not known, but we have the authority of Dr. Ross for the existence of a considerable stream, rather narrow but very deep, called the Tharthar, to the south-eastward of A1 Hadhr, which place he twice succeeded in reaching. The ruins are a mile in diameter, and are inclosed by a circular wall of very massive construction, with towers at intervals; the whole is surrounded by a deep ditch, and there are the remains of a mound, also circular, beyond it. 6 In the centre of the town stands the principal object of curiosity; a range of buildings inclosed by a strong wall, square on the plan, and similar in construction to that of the city; the faces are opposite to the four cardinal points, and each measures 300 paces in length inside. The buildings consist of spacious halls and chambers, covered by semicircular vaults, some of which rise to the height of 60 feet from the ground; and on the pilasters there are figures in relief, 7 appa rently Greek or Roman.

The course of the main stream continues as before, nearly S.E., for a short distance, when it receives the Holi. 5 This stream, the H61 of the Kurds and Yezids, 6 has its source two hours N.W. of Khatuniyah, and joins the main branch, now called the Khabur, after a course of two hours w.s.w. The Holi, or Hauli, has hitherto been considered as the and the H6i,. principal branch of the Hermas ; but we now find that the Holi, instead of being a considerable river, is merely a short affluent to the Khabur, and, moreover, there does not appear to be any other tributary to the latter in the fertile country about the small mountain town of Sinjar ; 7 so that the name of Hauli is merely connected with the main trunk, and not its tributary, the Mygdonius.

Just before its confluence, it passes eastward of the small town of Ahu Serai, built amidst the ruins of Kerkisiyah, 8 westward of those which are presumed to be the Kalneh, or Chalanne, of Nimrod; 3 and between these may still be traced some vestiges of the bridge once connecting those ancient cities. Below the tributary just followed, the course of the Euphrates is S. 20° E., along the southern side of some ancient ruins, presumed to be those of Dakia; 4 it proceeds next to the little town of Ma'den, lower down on the opposite side, and near the ancient castle of Rahabah, or Rehoboth, 5 which is about three and a half miles to the S.W. of the latter place. From hence the river passes onwards through a fine country, generally well wooded and rather hilly, but very thinly peopled, as far as Is-Geria and Werdi; which latter is 75^ miles from the Khabur by the windings, and 45J miles S. 33° E. in direct distance.

Below this picturesque spot the windings are less frequent than in the portion just described; and the course of the river is through a succession of partially wooded hills, chiefly of chalk formation, affording good pasture. Villages occa sionally appear, with cultivated grounds about them; and the numerous remains of ancient aqueducts, covering both banks, sufficiently show, what we learn from history, namely, that this portion of the country was at one time thickly inhabited by a civilized and flourishing people. The distance from 'Anah to the island of Hadisah is 49^ miles by the stream, and 28^ miles S. 48° E. in a direct line. The town contains about 400 houses, and it is built on the ruins of the ancient Hadith. The river at this place has an average width of Breadth and 300 yards, with a depth of 18 feet, and a current of four Hadith. near knots per hour in the season of floods, when it forms 30 islands, some of which are wooded, and a few, such as Tilbus, have on them the remains of ancient buildings. Above Hadisah, and at about two-thirds of the distance from Anah, the river, being turned by high hills, makes a very remark- able sweep in the opposite direction, or N.E., not unlike theoret tend^ Thames at the Isle of Dogs, though on a larger sSale ; for the Euphrates, at the spot called Hawaji el Khawwaslik, has gained only 2J miles to the S.E., although its course along the bend is 16| miles.

The scenery is like that of the preceding portion of the river in every respect; and about midway there is a-similar great sweep, by which, during a course of 14J miles, it only gains 5^ miles south-eastward, velocity there, Tlle stream ' throughout this part of its course, has an ' average width of 350 yards, with a depth of 16 feet, and a current of three knots per hour in the season of floods; when there are 14 islands, some of which contain small towns, built on ancient sites. Three miles below Hit the remains of aqueducts disappear, and the windings become shorter and more frequent, as the river flows through a tract of country almost level, and at Feiujah. At a distance of 77 miles along the stream, or 48 miles direct, S. 70° E., is the modern castle of Feiujah, situated 29|- miles W. 2° N. of Baghdad. The average width in this part of the river decreases a little, being only about 250 yards, with an ordinary depth of 20 feet; and there is a current of less than two and a half miles per hour in the flood season, when the river forms 13 islands, without wood. Sakiawiyah, . Above F elijjah, at 5f miles N. 60° W. from it, the deriva- or i'sa Canal, tion, called the Sakiawiyah, takes place ; this stream crosses Mesopotamia by a tortuous eastern course on the north side of Akar Kiif, and now enters the Tigris at a point five miles below Baghdad; but, until altered by Daud Pasha, to avoid the danger of inundations, it joined the Tigris a little above the city. The distance from river to river (by the course of the Euphrates steamer in passing, under Lieutenant Lynch, in 1838) is about 45 miles. The remains of aCHAP.

This cut (he adds) was called after I'sa, a descendant from the family of Khaliph A1 Mansur ; 3 and was excavated, says Edrisi, in order thus to reach Baghdad. 4 Below this castle there is a pastoral, but thinly inhabited ^ a ?^^ 0 e posed country, extending along the river for 37 miles to the mounds rivers, of Muhammed. From thence to the mouth of the Sakla- wiyah canal on the Tigris, this part of Mesopotamia is but 18 miles broad, and the ground has a gentle slope, so as to be admirably suited for a canal, which would, as in ancient times, connect the commerce of the two rivers; and, in this way, Baghdad might be reached from the Upper Euphrates, without the circuitous route by the peninsula of Kurnah. 5 Between the Saklawiyah and the mounds just mentioned Remains of may be still traced portions of three other ancient canals of intercommunication. The most northern of these is known as the Abu Gharib inlet; from a spot six miles below Felujah it first runs eastward, and again, from a point about two miles south of the extensive Babylonian mounds of Kushk, or Sindea, it inclines E.S.E., or towards the Tigris, at a spot eight miles below the river Diyalah. Abu-l-feda 6 says, the river Sersar separates from the Euphrates below the I sa, till it 1 Djisir Dehma of AM-l-fedd, and Djisir Dina of Edrisi; Tome VI., p. 157, Recueil de Voyages, &amp;c. 2 MS. translation of Abii-l-feda, by Mr. Rassam. 3 Ibid. . i o • u ( j 4 Page 144, Tome VI, Recueil de Voyages et de Me moires par la Soci^te de Geographie de Paris, 1840. 5 In the printed Reports submitted to Government in 1833, I proposed the line between Makdam and Baghdad, a distance of 22 miles; but the line of levels carried from one river to the other in 1837, by Corporal Greenhill, of the Royal Sappers and Miners, has shown that the object might be more easily accomplished from a spot a little southward of Baghddd. 6 MS. translation of Mr. Rassam.Supposed traces of the' Flumen Regium.

Six miles below the Nahr Sersar, the inlet of Abu Gharib coincides with another ancient canal, of which there are traces, at intervals, in the direction of the ruins of Dan, and of Khan Izaid, on the road from Hillah to Baghdad, and as far as the lower part of the ruins of Seleucia. Its termination at the latter point, as well as the traditional name of Nahr Malka, seem to connect this cut with the Flumen Regium of Ammianus Marcellinus, as well as of our historian Gibbon; which was so celebrated by the passage of the fleets of Trajan and Julian. Abu-l-feda 2 places the El Melik next below the Sersar, adding, that it waters all the country of 'Irak, which is around it, and falls into the Tigris under Modain. This, ac cording to Pliny, 3 was the work of Gobaris, to protect Babylon from inundations, and was called by the Assyrians, Armalkhar. 4 The fourth is the river Kuthah, which runs nearly parallel to the three others, from the mounds of Muhammed to the centre of Mesopotamia, where a bifurcation takes place. The northern branch seems to have continued in a S.S.-easterly direction towards the Tigris, or towards the ruins of 'Ashik wa Ma'shukah (the lover and his beloved), about 10 miles below Modain; whilst the other, called the Nahr Dhiyab, took a southerly direction, or towards Babylon, passing the Khan of Iskanderiyah. Abti-l-feda says, 5 the Kuthea is a channel from the Euphrates, below El Melik; beyond Far- sans it divides, the southern branch spreading into a marshy country, and the other, which is the larger, entering the Tigris below the Almalik. 6 Below the mounds of Muhammed, the great river takes a straighter course, in a more southerly direction, as far as the floating bridge on the western side of the town of Musseyib; 1 A flourishing commercial town, nine miles from Baghdad, situate on a navigable canal, over which there is a bridge of boats.—Edrisi: p. 157, Tome VI., Recueil de Voyages et de M&amp;noires publit? par la Society de Geographic de Paris, 1840. « Mr. Rassam's MS. translation. 3 Lib.

The stream, in this part of its course, has an average breadth of 200 yards, with an ordinary depth of 15 feet, and a current of barely two and a half knots per hour in the season of floods, when there are 15 low islands, some of them covered with jungle.

The numerous canals drawn from each side, at short intervals from each other, in order to irrigate the fields, as well as the date-groves and pomegranate-gardens, near the villages here covering both banks, produce a change in the appear ance of the country, which, although very gradual, becomes sufliciently evident, especially after passing the derivation called Yusufiyah, which takes place 1 at one mile and a half above Diwaniyah, a respectable Arab town, of about 1200 houses, situate on the left bank. About 18-g- miles below, Canal of Old another derivation, forming the canal of Old Lamlum, takes place, and the river rather decreases from hence to the entrance 1 This is on the eastern side of the Euphrates, and joins the Lamlum branch, previous to the junction of the latter with the main branch near EI Karayem. VOL. I. 158 LAMLUM MARSHES, AND CHALDEAN LAKE. [CHAP. III. of the canal, which is 75^ miles by water, and 55| miles S. 31° E. direct, from the floating bridge at Hillah. The river is reduced to 160 yards in width opposite Diwaniyah, and is again diminished to 120 yards towards Lamlum; having an ordinary depth of about 12 feet, with a current of two miles and three-quarters per hour in the season of floods; and it forms but one island in all the distance from Babel to the commencement of what was at one time the Chaldean lake. At the north-western extremity of the plain, the Euphrates forms two branches^ from which smaller ones and numerous irrigating cuts subsequently diverge. These reunite at some rising ground near El Karayem, which presents itself on both sides of the main trunk, and there is thus produced what may truly be called a delta, although distant from the sea; since the obstruction thus offered during the season of floods, causes the waters to spread for about 30 miles, that is, from the north-western to the south-eastern extremity of the basin ; the latter extends in width from 10 to 14 miles westward of the main channel, and to a much greater distance on the opposite, or eastern side. 1 On the right bank of the smaller branch, 2 and immediately after the separation, stands the singular town of Lamlum, which contains about 400 houses, neatly constructed entirely of reeds. Nearly a mile below the separation of the Lamlum branch, another, called the canal of Sasend, takes place on the opposite side, in the direction of Samawah. The main channel now pursues, with a diminished volume, the general direction of S.E., by a number of very deep, short bends in the marshes ; near the extremity of which it is rejoined by the Serayah, or Semawah branch, on the western side. At seven miles lower, near Karayem, 3 which is 42 miles by water, and 331 m iies, S. 48° E., from the bifurcation, it again receives the eastern branch coming from Lamlum, having previously received, on both sides, the remains of what had 1 We found what appeared to be also a part of the Chaldean lake, along the Tigris, in 1836. 8 This goes towards the Kardyem inlet, hut it Was not followed during the Expedition. 8 Better known as Grahim inlet.CHAP.

Being thus reunited to its former waters, benches, and at the same time free from those marshes in which it had been supposed to be lost, 1 the Euphrates suddenly re appears on its former large scale, inclosed between high banks covered with jungle. Soon after this change, when passing the western side of the mat village of A1 Khudhr, which is 49^ miles by water, and 36^ miles, S. 43° E., direct from Lamlum, it averages 200 yards in breadth, and contains nine small islands. The greater branch had, in the marshes, and during the season of floods, a bare average breadth of about 60 yards, with an ordinary depth of eight feet: a portion of the right bank is, however, still visible, and is used by trackers. Like the country inwards on each side of the river, the left bank is covered with a shallow inundation. The country amidst which numerous villages, consisting of houses formed inuridated - of reeds, covered with mats of the same material, appear here and there on the more elevated spots of ground, which are all but hidden by the water. Below A1 Khudhr the course of the river is tolerably straight, and it flows through a fertile country, abounding with villages, either of mats or tents, surrounded by rich date-groves. The largest of the former class is A1 Kut, the residence of the Sheikh of Montefik, which is situated on the left bank, eight miles above Sheikh el Shuyukh. This last is a considerable place on the right bank; it contains sheikh el i i t r i. Shuyukh. about 1500 clay-built houses, and nearly as many ot mats, and is situated at the distance of 64^ miles by water, or 50 miles, S. 67° E., in a direct line from A1 Khudhr. From this place to Sheikh el Shuyukh the average width of the river is about 250 yards, and its ordinary depth is 20 feet, with a current of two miles and a half per hour in the season of floods. There is but one island in this part of its course. 1 Some, like Polybius, General History, book IX., chap, ix., believed that the river exhausts itself in different channels before it reaches the sea; and the transport of armies in those parts is extremely tedious.—Hampton's translation, London, 1809, Vol. III., p. 107. i 260 SHATT EL 'ARAB, AND RIVER KERKHAH. [CHAP. III. Below Sheikh el Shuyukh, the largest and most important town permanently occupied by the Arabs on the line of the Euphrates, the river turns nearly eastward, and the banks Velocity near being very low, it again forms a kind of delta, extending to Kurnah, which is 62| miles by water, or 49f miles nearly due east, 1 direct from Sheikh el Shuyukh. Within that distance the river preserves the same breadth as before; its depth is 18 feet, and it has a current, in the season of floods, of two miles per hour, independently of the tide, which is slightly felt all the way. Town of The walled town of Kurnah contains about 800 houses, disposed along the right bank of the Tigris and the left of that of the Euphrates. It fluctuates as to size, and it was larger in 1831 than we found it in 1836 and 1837. It is chiefly constructed of reed-mats, and is on part of the sup posed site of ancient Apamea; which probably stood within the line of walls still extending across the peninsula formed where the two great rivers cease to be known by their individual names. Union of the The Euphrates and Tigris, now forming one tidal channel, Euphrates and a } mogt a m il e wide, take nearly a straight course, S. 37° E., under the well known appellation of Shatt el Arab, and when five miles below Kurnah their united waters receive those of the Kerah, or Kerkhah, which, coming from the mountains of Ardelan, through an extensive tract of country, passes a short distance westward of the ruins of Susa, and likewise of the town of Hawizah. 2 After receiving this accession, the Shatt el Arab flows through date-groves and near several villages, chiefly on the left bank, and at length arrives opposite Basrah, which is 39^ miles by the river, and 36 miles S. 34° E. direct from Kurnah. In the whole of this distance there are but two islands, both of them large; and the river has an average width of 600 yards, with a depth of 21 feet; it has a current of two knots per hour during the flowing, and three knots per hour during the ebb tide. 1 S. 99° E. 2 This river will be found more fully described in the Chapter on Khuzistdn.

III.] THE KARUN AND FLOODING OF THE EUPHRATES. 61 The modern town of Basrali is built on both sides of a Town of creek, or canal, and in its present decayed state, as compared Ba?rah ' with former times, it still contains about 6000 houses, which commence nearly at the edge of the main stream, and on its right bank. Below the city this majestic river sweeps a little more to the eastward; its width -is about 700 yards; its ordinary depth 30 feet; and it forms three large islands between this place and the small town of Mohammarah; that is, within a distance of 22^ miles by water, or 20^ miles direct, The Kar.m S. 70° E. Here the Karun enters it, after a long course from shatter Arab, the Koh-i-zerd, through Shuster, Ahwaz, and other places. 1 After this great accession to its waters, the Shatt el Arab inclines a little more towards the south; during the remainder of its course it passes many large villages, and almost con tinuous belts of date-groves; and at length it reaches the sea, which, at the bar, is 40 miles from Mohammarah. Between this last place and the sea its average width is 1200 yards, and its ordinary depth 30 feet. The permanent flooding of the Euphrates is caused by the Periodical melting of the snow in the mountains along the upper part E^phrate^ the of its course. This takes place about the beginning of March, and it increases gradually up to the time of barley harvest, or about the last days in May, when it is usually at its greatest height. At Port William the depth was found to be increased by 13J feet; but, lower down, this varied, as m^y be supposed, in different places, according to the width of the stream. The river continues high, and its course very rapid, for 30 or 40 days; but afterwards there is a daily decrease, which becomes very small and regular towards the autumn. From the middle of September to the middle of October the river is at the lowest; and it even seems to be perfectly stationary, until the rains commence, towards the end of October, when there is a perceptible but variable increase, which continues till the frost checks it in December, and causes it again to fall. From this time until the beginning of March it is subject to slight alternations of decrease and increase. The reader will find these variations placed before 1 See Chapter VIII. on Khuzistan.62 FLOODING OF THE EUPHRATES. [CHAP. III. him in one view by the accompanying plate; which shows, in minute detail, the changes of the river between the 26th of July, 1835, and the 13th of June, 1836, when we entered the Persian Gulf. This will enable those who are interested in the subject to ascertain the variations more readily than they could he obtained from any general description. 1 Mean velocities From the measurements and calculations of Lieutenants Cleveland and Murphy, it is found that, at Hit, the mean of the velocities of the current, at high and low water, in the Euphrates, is 4*46 feet per second; and that, at Baghdad, the mean velocity of the Tigris is 7*33 feet per second. The mean velocity of the Danube, at Pesth, has, by Mr. George Rennie, been ascertained to be 2-33 feet per second ; and M. Girard determined the mean velocity of the Nile, at Cairo, to be only 1 foot 11 inches per second. It may not be uninteresting to mention here, that, from the shatfd 'Arab 6 observations of the two officers above-mentioned, Mr. Rennie Danube. found the quantity of water discharged by the Euphrates, at .Hit, to be 72804 cubic feet per second; and the quantity dis charged by the Tigris, at Baghdad, to be 164103 cubic feet. The sum of these quantities (=236907 cubic feet) may, per haps, be taken as a near approximation to the whole quantity discharged in a second by the Shatt el Arab, which is formed by the united waters of those rivers. Mr. Rennie estimates the quantity discharged by the Danube, in an equal time, at 338100 cubic feet. Having thus followed, in a general way, the courses of the four great rivers which rise in Central Armenia, I enter next upon the proposed geographical account of the countries in their neighbourhood; these are, Iran, or the territory east ward, and Arabia on the west; and, in the course of the description, some notices concerning their ancient boundaries and condition will occasionally be presented, 1 The graduated scale was planned, as well as executed, by Acting Serjeant Major William Quin, Royal Artillery, storekeeper during the Expedition, who kept the daily register of those changes, as well as the ranges of the ther mometer ; and from whom I have received the most valuable and unremitting assistance during the three last years in preparing the different maps accom panying this work. of the Euphrates, Tigris, &amp;c.

H aving in tlie preceding Chapters given a general descriptiGn ^tenu,^ of the four principal rivers of Western Asia, as well as of the between the^ circumjacent territory, it now becomes requisite, consistently N, ean with the plan of this part of the work, briefly to notice all the countries in that part of the world which have been connected together geographically and historically; in conse quence of having been at one period subject to the sway of the same monarch. The space now to be considered is that which lies, between the great natural boundaries formed by the rivers Nile and Indus, and comprehends the dilferent satrapies which constituted the empire of Darius Hystaspes. This mighty empire extended from Libya on the west, to India on the east, or from 30° to 70° E. longitude; and from Scythia on the north, to the Indian sea on the south, or from 45° to 25° north latitude. It thus formed an immense parallelogram, containing nearly 800 square degrees, with its extremities bordering upon four remarkable seas; the Black and Caspian being on the north, the Mediterranean on the west, and the Indian Ocean on the south. From the last two great branches strike northward along each side of the extensive peninsula of Arabia: of these, the Persian Gulf64 FEATURES, VARIETIES OF CLIMATE. [CHAP. IV. formed one navigable inlet into the heart of the great empire just mentioned; whilst the Red Sea afforded another, at a considerable distance westward. The latter terminates with the Gulfs of Suez and Akabah at the northern, and the Straits of Bab-el-mandeb at the southern extremity; whilst the well known Straits of Hormuzd mark the entrance of the former, and its upper, or north-western extremity is formed by the estuary of the Euphrates. Through the whole of the territory stretching from this river eastward to the valley of the Indus, and westward to that of the Nile, a remarkable similarity prevails in the geographical features. General On glancing at the most striking objects, the mountains, the mountains, it will be remarked, that several great branches quit the elevated plateau about the springs of the Euphrates, Tigris, &amp;c., and take different directions; but chiefly eastward, south ward, and westward, from the summit of Ararat. Two of these, the Zagros and Elburz, gradually diverge, in distinct lines, as far as the eastern limits of ancient Persia; whilst the no less striking arms of the Taurus proceed to the opposite extremities, and preserve the same bold features, as they spread their numerous ramifications over Asia Minor, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, and Arabia. Owing to the deficiency of large rivers, and the scarcity of running streams, cultivated spots are rare; whilst dry, untenanted valleys, extensive plains, and gigantic plateaux, broken by rugged mountains, form the prevailing characteristics of the countries under consideration. Temperature In a wide expanse of territory, stretching, with various elevations, at least 25° from north to south, such extremes may be looked for as will bear out the remarkable description of the younger Cyrus. 1 Thus, the northern and central por tions of the plateaux of Iran and Arabia, as well as a great part of Asia Minor, enjoy a temperate climate; whilst an intense cold prevails in the northern parts of Afghanistan, in nearly the whole of Kurdistan, and on the elevated moun tain ranges and high valleys on both sides of Ararat. Yet 1 ' In the dominions of my father,' said the Prince, ' people perish with cold at the one extremity, whilst they are suffocated with heat at the other.'— Xenophon's Anabasis, Book I., pp. 67, 68. Ed. Hutch. USS.CHAP. IV.] DIVISIONS. 65 notwitlistanding this difference of climate, tlirougliout the whole a great similarity prevails in the vegetable and animal worlds ; and in these respects the valley of the Nile, the plains of Mesopotamia, and those of Arabia southward of Mecca, together with the central and southern parts of Iran, have much in common. Exclusive of the provinces occupied by Russia, the space Extent and ^ between the Indus and the Mediterranean sea forms three r^. kingdoms almost of equal size. Persia occupies the centre, Afghanistan the eastern, and the different provinces of Asiatic Turkey the opposite, or western extremity. Instead, however, of following the subdivisions of each of these por tions, it seems preferable to consider the whole as constituting two great divisions, separated from each other by the basin of the Euphrates, with its continuation, the Persian Gulf; Asia Minor, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt being on one side of this natural line of bisection; and, on the other, an equal portion of territory, which,' under the name of Iran, formed the eastern, or principal part of the ancient Persian empire of Darius Hystaspes. The surface of Iran extended 1280 geographical miles in length, from Sumeisat on the Upper Euphrates, eastward to Taxila on the Indus ; and nearly 900 miles in breadth, from the shores of Gedrosia, in 25° north latitude, to the banks of the Oxus, near Samarkand, in 40° north latitude. The latter river and the Caspian Sea form the northern limit of this great division; the Erythrean Sea 1 is on the southern, whilst the rivers Indus and Euphrates constitute the eastern and western extremities. In Iran nature hasiuw* displayed her works on a scale of unrivalled grandeur, more particularly by the formation of the gigantic plateau from the base of Ararat, spreads eastward almost 1 This name was a] which it forms on ea( xxiv.

IV. feet 1 From this high ground the principal rivers, valleys, and mountains of Western Asia diverge, in different directions, towards the four seas at the extremities of the territory; and to the shores of these seas it is intended now to trace the different mountain-chains from one common root. Ararat, the centre of most of these branches, elevates its snow-clad summits in a district nearly equidistant from the Black and Caspian Seas ; the city of Erivan being in the plain on the northern, whilst Bayazid and its castle occupy spurs from a range of mountains on the southern side. The plain, of about 10 miles in width, which separates the latter from the base of that celebrated mountain, is covered with lava; and the formation of the mass itself indicates the presence of that volcanic agency which caused the recent catastrophe. 2 Form and Two vast conical peaks, which rise far above all others in ofArarat. 0118 this part of the country, constitute the great centre of the ' mountains of Ararat.' The lower one is steeper and more pointed than the higher, from which it is separated by a sloping plain on the north-western side; the direct distance between their summits being about seven miles. The ascent of the great mountain appears to be easier than that of its younger brother, especially on the western side ; 3 and the summit of it has, in fact, been gained by the enterprising Dr. Parrott. 4 The difficulties of the journey are, however, considerable, and these have given rise to the local and expressive name which is borne by the mountain itself. 5 Owing to the height of the spectator, and the great elevation of the neighbouring parts of the chain, the highest summit of Western Asia appears 1 The bridge over the Aras is 5478 feet above the sea.—See Mr. Brant's Journey: p. 431, Vol. X.

IV.] KURDISTiN RANGE, ANTI-TAURUS. 67 only like a mountain of the second or third class, when seen from the country about Bayazid; but when viewed from a The Kurdiatau greater distance, the effect is truly majestic. From Diyadin, railge ' for instance, this monarch of mountains towers far above the rest of the chain, to which it seems not to belong; although it is, in reality, the culminating point of the whole system. The first of the numerous chains which descend from thence is the elevated range forming the back-bone of the Assyrian mountains, which, with its principal ramifications, derives importance from the circumstance of its valleys containing a large portion of the inhabitants of the whole country. This range, or the main ridge of Kurdistan, has mount Ararat at the northern extremity; from the slopes of which it runs S.S.E., between lakes Van and Urumiyah, and along the western side of Azerbaijan, to the extremity of the province, where it takes a southerly direction along Ardelan, and ex tends as far as 35° north latitude. It is composed of red sandstone, dialidge, and basalt, terminating in needle points at a considerable elevation; 1 while its irregular, rocky sides are partially wooded, and frequently form basins, or amphi theatres. Numerous arms diverge eastward and westward from this root; and between the eastern branches, which are those already mentioned as traversing Azerbaijan, the waters collected by the basins of the Araxes, Kizil Uzen, &amp;c., are conveyed into the Caspian Sea; whilst the others inclose the valleys along the different tributaries of the Halys, Euphrates, and Tigris. The contour of these western branches takes the form of an acute triangle, having the apex westward of the Euphrates, and the crests of the Kurdistan or Armenian The ^Anti- mountains for its base; the sides being formed by portions of the ranges of the Anti-Taurus and Taurus. Beginning at the northern extremity of the space thus formed, it will be found that two parallel chains run westward from the foot of Ararat, at Bayazid, to Diyadin.

The northern branch runs parallel to the Murad as far as Molla 'Osman, from whence it skirts the northern side of the valley of the Murad, inclining more southward, until it enters Asia Minor near Kebban Ma'den, and exhibiting to the sight, at intervals, the elevated groups of Sheryan Tagh, Kara Kaya, Bingol Tagh, and Dujik Tagh. There is like wise a lower range running parallel to the higher, and between it and the right bank of the Murad.

Previously to crossing the Euphrates the chain is more continuous, and has a higher elevation than the pre ceding branch; as the lofty groups of Sir Sera and Mut Khan, the Ala Tagh, Sapan, Nimrud, and Darkish Taghs sufficiently indicate. Limestone and gypsum prevail, with Geological basalt, and other volcanic rocks. Deep valleys separate the c aracter ' parallel ridges, and also break their continuity by occasional passes from the northern to the southern sides. The southern slopes have pines mixed with spruce, fir, oaks, ash, walnut, and poplars below. Those on the north are scantily covered with dwarf and valonia oak, with, gum tragacanth and shrubs, amongst which rhododendron and hellebore are at times conspicuous. The lower parts of the valleys afford pasture; and the sides are cultivated in terraces, with grain, rhubarb, &amp;c., about the villages. These, notwithstanding their peculiar construction, are picturesque 2 from their situa tion, 3 and rich in appearance, owing to the fruits and flowers about them. 4 That portion of these chains which runs along the southern side of the Murad valley appears to answer to the Anti-Taurus J™'™** of Strabo and Pliny, and being above the line of perpetual Anti-Taurus, snow at the peaks of Ala Tagh, Sapdn, Nimrtid, and the peaked glacier of Mut Khan, it is manifestly more elevated than the Taurus itself. It separates Armenia from Mesopo tamia, 5 and likewise Acilisene from Sophene to the south; whilst the bare rocky felspar peaks of Kal'at Tagh (on which is built the town of Arghani) and All Tagh form its abut ments in the latter direction, skirting the northern side of the basaltic plain of Diy4r Bekr, 7 which produces three kinds of jasper. 8 ■ Mr. Brant's Journey: Vol. X.

Course of Near the southern extremity of the main ridge of Kurdis- Taums proper. ^ ran g e designated Taurus proper 1 diverges from the Zagros in two almost parallel lines. The southern and lower line, called the Kara Tagh, runs W.N.W. to the pass of Der- bend, near Suleimanlyah, where, under the name of the Azmir Tagh, or Jiozeh hills, it inclines a little more to the north, as far as the Lesser Zah; and onward to the culminating point of Pir-Man, near the banks of the Great Zab. The greater range, first known as the Avroman, and afterwards as the Kurkur, 2 runs W. N.W., passing close to Sulei'mamyah, and onward to the point of junction with the other near the south side of the Koi-Sanjak plain. From hence the single chain runs N.W. to the Greater Zab, where it resumes the previous direction of W. S.W., and, under the names of the Zebari and Amadiyah mountains, skirts the southern side of the singular country occupied by the Kaldani Christians. Towards the western extremity of their territory, where it is called Buhtan, or Judi Tagh, it sweeps northward to the valley of the Tigris; beyond which its course is nearly west of Mardin, entering Asia Minor above Sumeisat, but previously sending out a branch from the peak of Karadja Tagh, which curves round Severik and Gergen Kal'eh, and is lost in the elevated mountains of Cilicia. The range followed thus far, and forming nearly one- half of ancient Taurus, is divided into two equal portions ; but that which is eastward of the river Tigris is on a much grander scale than the other, especially near the elevated peaks of Jebel Maklub, Om el Safra, Raban Ormuz, Jebel its geological Abiat, and Jebel Judi. The formation is chiefly of limestone, c ara with red sandstones, conglomerate, and occasionally jasper. 3 Conical, bare summits, with irregular sides, either bearing timber, or partially covered with the valonia plant and other shrubs, and intersected by deep valleys less or more peopled, are the prevailing characteristics of this striking portion of the range. In crossing Upper Mesopotamia, the Taurus is ' Strabo, XL, p. 521. s Ainsworth's Assyria and Babylonia, p. 247. 8 Ainsworth's Researches in Assyria, &amp;c., pp. 272 and 286; also MS. of do.CHAP.

Conical summits, with steep sides almost deprived of wood, prevail as far as the latter point; beyond which, towards O'rfah, there is a chalk formation. Northward of this city, however, bold limestone declivities succeed, the lower beds of which, at the pass of Taurus, near Gergen Kal'eh, 2 are mixed with red sandstones and conglomerates. From the eastern side, and a little higher, the great arm of Anti-Taurus curves northward; sending out inferior branches in the latter direction, and continuing to diverge more and more from the Taurus, until their opposite extremities are separated by that part of ancient Assyria, which extends from the southern slopes of Mount Ararat to the Zagros range, in 35° north latitude. As the western branches of the Taurus are to be traced in a subsequent Chapter, it is only necessary, with regard to the mountains so called, to remind the reader, that anciently the name had a most extensive signification. Following Erato sthenes, Strabo says, that Asia Is divided from west to east by this great chain; the territory lying northward of it being designated by the Greeks, on this side of the Taurus; whilst that to the southward was called beyond the Taurus? The mountain chain is said to extend, in length, through Great extent the whole continent, with a breadth, in many places, of 3000 ofthelaurus - stadia; and from it the rivers flow in opposite directions, or from north to south. 4 This great width, which is equal to about 340 miles, indicates an extensive tract of country, such as the plateau of Iran, rather than a mere chain of moun tains ; 5 especially as it contained the Parthians, Medes, and 1 Mr. Ainsworth's Journey from Constantinople: Vol. X.

Beyond the Euphrates, says Strabo, the great mountain Anti-Taurus extends, from the borders of Commagene and Melitene, towards the north, inclosing Sophene in a valley between it and Taurus Proper: it sepa rates into several branches, and to the north of the Niphates is the range called Paryadres, with the mountains of the Moschi. Some of the branches extend into Armenia, 4 and as far as Iberia and Albania; and, towards the east, others proceed along the Caspian Sea as far as Media and Atropatia. Towards the south, the Taurus divides Sophene and part of Armenia from Mesopotamia: 5 this part of the chain is by some called the Gordisei, and to it belongs Mount Masius, which has, on the south, the cities of Nisibis and Tigranocerta. Afterwards the mountains become more elevated, and join the Zagros, which divides Media from Babylonia. Southward of the point where the Assyrian mountains join the Zagros, the latter, under the name of the Shahu, or Mountains of the Cosssei, continues to run in the previous direction of S.S.E. into Persian Kurdistan, passing a little Geological way westward of Kirman-shah. The range is chiefly com- KurdSTri^ the P ose d of limestone and sandstone, with clay, slate, dialidge, mountains. quartz, and conglomerate, and occasionally granite.

Opposite Kirman-shah the chain bends more eastward. The Bakhtiyan and, under the denomination of the Laristan mountains, it mountains -' runs towards Shuster, where it takes the name of its dominant tribe, the Bakhtiyari, which name it preserves as far as Bei- bahan. Eastward of this place it is called the Hetzerdara, or Thousand Mountains ; it incloses the basin of Shiraz, and constitutes those ranges of naked, barren hills, which diversify the plain of Merdasht, one portion being the royal mountain of Persepolis. 2 A little way southward of the capital of Fars the chain curves to the S.E., and runs parallel to the coast at a distance of about 20 miles; the breadth of the chain being rather greater than that distance, and having an eleva tion of about 5000 feet as it approaches Cape Jask. Eastward of the latter point it skirts the shores of Mekran, rather decreasing in height until, near the banks of the Indus, it is lost in the Hala mountains. Where it has been examined, the formation is sandstone, limestone, gypsum, clays, and marls. 3 The brown, bare, and furrowed appearance belong ing to the first of these rocks, seems to be the prevailing character of this part of the chain; the sides and crests of which are generally deprived of vegetation; but the valleys, where they happen to be irrigated, produce the plantain, date, and other fruits, as well as grain. The other chain skirts the northern side of Iran. The Course of the first part of it (the Masula mountains) quits the plateau of branclTof the Ararat towards the eastern side of Karabagh, taking a Taurus - southerly direction from the banks of the Aras, along the western side of the plains of Talish. Thence it inclines east ward of south, skirting the western side of Ghilan as far as the pass of Rudbar, in three parallel ridges, with occasionally an elevation of 6000 or 7000 feet above the plain.

IV. this pass, taking the name of Elburz, it runs S.S.E., along the remainder of Ghilan and the province of Mazanderan, following the Caspian with its concave side as far as the mountain of Damavend, the crater-shaped summit of which is 14,700 feet above the Persian Gulf. 1 From this point to the mountain pass of Bestam, S.S.E. of Aster-abad, the direc tion of the chain is a little east of south; its width, including the hills on each side, is 50 or 60 miles; and its elevation approaches occasionally to 8000 feet. A little to the eastward of the pass the main branch curves to the N.E., and again about as far to the S.W., towards Mushed, nearly in the same latitude as the pass. Near the southern side of the holy city of the Shi'ahs the mountains of Khorasan take an east-south-easterly direction, and thus they continue till they are interrupted by the valley of Herat, having on each side numerous ridges rising about 1000 feet from the plain. 2 One of these runs from the main chain near Sherif-abad to the southward of Herat, whilst the ridge itself inclines towards the northern side of that city, at an elevation of about 3000 feet from the plain. Beyond the break just mentioned it bears the name of the Ghur moun tains, or ancient Parapamisus, and its direction is nearly east ; but afterwards it becomes the Hindu Kush, or Indian Caucasus: it skirts the northern side of Kabul, and, near the eastern frontier, it is lost in the stupendous Himalaya, after having formed an almost unbroken range to an extent of 25° from the banks of the Araxes to the vicinity of Attock. The geological structure of the great mountain-chains has been already slightly noticed; that of the intervening space remains to be glanced at. In most places the surface is largely impregnated with salt and saltpetre, which prevail to some extent on the plains of Fars and the conterminous provinces of 'Irak and Kirman. Between Abu-Shehr and Dalaki, crystallized sulphate of lime is found; and, a little westward (in Khuzistan), an abundant supply of sulphur; 1 Mr. Thomson's Ascent of Mount Datndyend : Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. VIII.

But one ol tlie most remarkable productions is mineral pitch, which is found in abundance in different states, from petroleum to the choicest kind of naphtha, and is applied to many useful purposes. The places most known are Baku and Mazanderan Minerals; towards the north; Kerkuk, Hit, Bandi-Kir, the Bactiari mountains, and Dalaki, towards the south; and both Kirman and Affghanistan towards the east. Iron and native steel is met with in Mazanderan, Khorassan, and Bactria. 1 The former, as well as copper 2 and lead ores, prevail in different parts of the eastern provinces; but more abundantly 3 in the pashalics of Diyar Bekr and Sivas, with the addition of gold, silver, 4 and precious stones. 5 The ordinary, as well as some of the more precious metals and valuable stones, are likewise found in the eastern provinces, 6 and also in Azerbaijan; copper and other ores abound in Kurdistan, the Julamerik, and other mountain districts. Since the days of Pliny, and even more anciently, the slopes of the Caucasus have been remarkable for an abundance of precious stones, as well as metals; all of which are de scribed in a work written in the seventh century of the Hejirah, by Muhammed Ben Maussur, for the use of the Shah Abu Nassr Behardirchan, of the Abassides. We are indebted to the talented orientalist. Von Hammer, for a translation 7 of part of the work; in which the author not their ckssifica- only describes the precious stones, and gives their Persian tl0n ' names, but also shows, by a minute classification, that almost all the existing gems were known to the Persians in that age. 1 Voyages de Chardin, Tome IV., p. 63. 8 At Ma'den Kapur.—Ainsworth's Assyria and Babylonia, p. 273. 3 The valley of Ekmah CMi contains boulders of native iron, some of wEich are three feet long,—Ibid., p. 285. 4 At Ma'den Gomush there are lead, silver, antimony, and iron. 5 In the Dumbu Tagh mountains the granite abounds with interesting minerals, more particularly topaz, beryl, schorl, and disseminated gold.— Ibid., p. 285. 6 Elphinstone's Kdbul, pp. 146 and 147.

Of the most important, as well as by far the most productive of these, the pearl (Marvand), the author enumerates 12 different classes according to their properties, and 15 different sizes according to the sieves through which they are passed : but he gives the preference to the Indian 1 over those of Kishm and Karak.

The valleys of the Oxus, the Indus, and nearly the whole of that of the Euphrates, being at the extremities of Iran, that territory (in addition to the Tigris and Araxes, with their tributaries) has only the advantage of the Salyan, the Aji, Jeghetu, 1 and Sefid Riid, towards the north; the Zenderud, Indian, and Bendimir, in the centre; the Helmand with its tributary, and the Farr-ar-rud, more eastward. Besides these, there are some inferior streams, which are, after a short course, either lost by absorption, or become saline. Extensive salt lakes and streams, impregnated with the same substance, are by no means uncommon; amongst the former may be men tioned the Caspian Sea, the picturesque Urumiyah, 2 and Van, Zerrah, or Durrah, in Seistan, Baktegan in Fars, and others; the fresh-water lakes are only met with in the tracts below Babylon, and again between the Elburz range and the shores of the Caspian. The surface of Iran may, in a general way, be described as consisting of a wide-spreading plateau, flanked by mountainous countries on the east and west, 3 and bounded to the north and south by the two mountain chains already Form of its described, outside of which are two extensive plains, on a 8urface - much lower level. Of these, Turcomania, with the con tinuous plain westward of it, between the Caspian Sea and the Elburz mountains, form that which is on the northern extremity; Arabian 'Irak and Khuzistan, with the rest of the level tract outside the Zagros, form the plain at the southern extremity. Of the higher table-lands, filling up the space inside of the great chains, only a small portion is at present cultivated; and, from the number of ruined cities, villages, and Kanats, it is manifest that desert tracts have increased very much during the two last centuries.

General ground, accounts for this change in the appearance of tlie stenhiy of coim try; about two-thirds of wliich are, from the absence of water, reduced to a desert. The nature of the surface, how ever, varies considerably, the soil being, in many places, suited to the wants of a pastoral people ; whilst in others it consists of a deep and moving sand, which seems doomed to hopeless sterility, and such is the worst part of the Balu chistan desert. In other places the ground consists of pebbles and flints, with a dark burnt appearance, destitute of grass, or only showing a few stunted tamarisks and other shrubs, together with a sprinkling of leafless, purple-coloured lilies, which have forced their way through what otherwise seems to be an impenetrable crust. Most generally, the country presents to the eye of the traveller only a monotonous, dry, cracked soil, encrusted with nitrous particles in the warm season; and covered with brackish marshes, in the low parts, during the winter. This, though unfit for the permanent abode of man, is not alto gether destitute of vegetation, but bears the soap-plant, camel- thorn, tamarisk, bebul, and other stunted shrubs, of which there are sufficient for the support of the camels. In places where the desert assumes its least unpromising aspect, it presents the appearance of a parched, cracked surface its scanty at one period of the year, but at another it yields a scanty supply of sheep grass; and, in consequence, it affords the means of nourishing the horses and flocks of the Iliyats, Kurds, and other tribes, when the severity of the weather forces them to descend into the plains, and change their locality as the pasture fails. Trees are very rarely seen, but wild liquorice and rue, the spice-plant, gum ammoniac, the tamarisk, bebul, and other shrubs, are scattered over the surface, which, not unfrequently, is barren from neglect, rather than from the want of capability in the soil itself. An uninhabited tract, partaking in different places of each of the above kinds of desert, intervenes between the cities of Teheran and Ispahan. It is known as the salt desert, and penetrates eastward into Khorasan, spreading southward from thence to the borders of Fars. Another such wasteCHAP. IV. J GENERAL ASPECT OF THE COUNTRl. 79 commences northward of the city of Kirman, from whence it Great central branches eastward till it joins that of Seistan, and westward desert ' till it unites with the preceding desert; so that, with the exception of the oases preserved by industry about the towns and villages, the desert extends upwards of 500 miles from west to east, and more than 300 miles from north to south. The soil is composed of hard clay mixed with dark gravel, or, which is more generally the case, it consists entirely of the former substance, in that exceedingly indurated state, which is, in all tropical climates, the natural consequence of the continued absence of water. Even where it is cultivated, the latter character prevails largely, till that period of the year at which the clay, or in some cases the clay mixed with gravel, is, by means of irrigation, brought from a state of barrenness to one of the utmost fertility. In a country deprived both of wood and water, consisting of wide-spreading plains, terminating with brown, irregular, rocky ridges, looking like the ruins of gigantic walls, and in which, moreover, the verdure of pasturage is confined to a . brief period of the spring, there can be but little to diversify the scenery. A dreary, monotonous, reddish-brown colour Monotonous is presented by everything in Iran; including equally the ^ n C try f the mountains, plains, fields, rocks, animals, and reptiles. For even in the more favoured districts, the fields which have yielded an abundant crop are so parched and burnt before midsummer, that if it were not for the heaps of corn in the villages near them, a passing stranger might conclude that a harvest was unknown in that apparently barren region. ' The extremes of climate usually found in a territory com- Different kinds prehending many degrees of latitude are greatly modified by of climate - the immense extent of the steppes, which produce a consider able uniformity of temperature. The surface of Iran may, however, be considered as enjoying four kinds of climate ; viz., the warm, the humid, the temperate, and the cold. A dry heat, exceeding that which is experienced in the West Indies, or even in Gibraltar during the height of summer, almost always prevails in the greatest part of 'Irak Arabia,80 DIFFERENT CLIMATES OF IRA-N. [CHAP. IV. Prevalence of the Duhistans of Fars, Moghistan, Mukran, and the central deserts. The alluvial soil around the Khors and lakes of central parts. Trees and shrubs. Khuzistan, Babylonia, and the lower tract at the southern extremity of the Caspian Sea, partake of the humid character. In these districts lengthened inundations are succeeded by damp fogs ; and sickness prevails in consequence, until a powerful sun has perfected that luxuriant vegetation for which they, and particularly those of Ghilan and Mazanderan, are remarkable. The great plateau, extending from the southern side of Azerbaijan through the finest portions of 'Irak, Fars, and Khorasan, enjoys the third, or temperate climate. For though the heat of the sun, when reflected from a soil destitute of verdure and timber, is considerable, this is diminished by the breezes which from the mountains occa sionally pass over the plains ; so that the evenings are agree able and the nights serene. This tract includes the most elevated portions of Affghanistan, 1 the Elburz, Taurus, Zagros, and Bakhtiyari mountains, with nearly the whole of Kurdistan. In these regions a low temperature prevails in summer; and the snow, which caps the mountains at this season, remains for months on the lower grounds, with a degree of cold almost equal to that of a high northern latitude. The vegetation naturally varies with the climate. In the warm and humid districts are the forest and fruit trees of the tropics, such as the cedar, cypress, olive, locust, date, orange, lemon, fig, plantain, pomegranate, pistachio, &amp;c.; as well as the sugar-cane, cochineal, indigo, cotton, and assafoetida plants; also the wild rose, poppy, gigantic anemone, and other flowers. In the temperate and cold climates are found nearly all the European trees, shrubs, and vegetables. 2 Besides tama risks, bebul, gum ammoniac, the benak, or spice-plant, wild liquorice, &amp;c.; and likewise a variety of pumpkins, melons, gourds, cucumbers, &amp;c. 1 Such as the Kohistan range, lying north of the Kdhul valley, and N.E. of Baluchistdn ; likewise the Kojeh' Amram, the Soleimdn, and other ranges bending towards the south. 2 The potato has been introduced lately by the British under Sir John Campbell, K.C.H.CHAP. IV.] VEGETATION OF IRAN. ANIMALS. 81 Rice, sesame, with Indian corn and fruits, are cultivated. Grains, in addition to European grains ; and tliere are two harvests in the year : the earlier grains ripen in the beginning of summer ; but there is a lighter harvest in the autumn; 1 the abundance in each case depending upon the success of the irrigation. This necessary operation is accomplished by means of Kanats, from which the water is skilfully conveyed in small channels to every part of the fields. The lion, tiger, leopard, hunting tiger, hyena, jackall, tiger- wild and cat, lynx, gour-khur, or wild ass, wild sheep (argali), moun tain goat (pauzen), wild dog, porcupine, jerboa, ferret, and mangoust, are found, in addition to the bear and the ordinary animals of Europe. Among the domestic animals the horse holds the principal tame animals, place, and there are four distinct kinds in Iran. First, the original Turkoman breed, a large, powerful, enduring animal; second, the yauboo, or common carrying hack, which is stouter and rather larger than our galloway. Then the smaller Arabian breed (first introduced by Nadir Shah) ; and, lastly, a fourth, between this animal and the Turkoman horse, the bid-pai (wind-footed), which, being the most prized by the Persians, is almost always among the horses of a great man's retinue. It is not the custom of the country to crop or mutilate this noble creature; but the tails, manes, bellies, and legs, particularly of their white and dapple horses, are frequently dyed; and the favourite colours are orange, red, and yellow. With the exception of that derived from the Arabian breed, the ass is, in these countries, an inferior animal; but there is an unusual proportion of mules, which, though small, are very much used for caravans.

The low, strong, rough-haired animal, with two humps, called bughur, which was brought originally from Bactria; and the taller, lighter Arabian breed, called schutter, of which there are three or four classes adapted to different purposes. There is likewise a third, or mule breed, between the Arabian and Bactrian, with a single hump, but much larger than that on the back of the former; it is called Ner, and is much prized as a beast of burthen, especially by the Turkomans. Besides the buffalo, and other domestic animals, there are large-tailed sheep, the long-haired cat, and a particularly fine swift dog, the Macedonian greyhound. The subjects to be noticed in ornithology are two or three sorts of eagles, 1 the Ahubarah (a kind of bustard), Capk-e- Derri (royal partridge), the black and desert partridge, 2 phea sant, jungle fowl (towards Affghanistan), several varieties of the heron, the magpie, and myriads of a kind of quail, 3 nearly as large as a pigeon, the blackbird, thrush, and nightingale. Fowls are abundant, but common geese and ducks very rare. In ichthyology, the Persian Gulf, as well as the Black and Caspian Seas, are more remarkable for the quantity than the variety of specimens; but sturgeon and the sterlet, a delicate kind of carp, abound in the Caspian Sea, where they are taken chiefly for the caviar and isinglass. In the rivers towards the southern extremities of the empire, barbel and carp, especially the latter, attain a prodigious size. Serpents abound, as in ancient times, in the plains of Moghan, and elsewhere there are several kinds, which, in general, are harmless; but the bite of the long bright-coloured snake, so abundant in different parts of the Persian Gulf (a little way from the shore), is said to be very dangerous. Large-sized lizards are numerous, as well as tarantulas and scorpions, both white and black. The latter, or that which is found in Kashan, and on the plains of Abu-Sh^hr, is con sidered dangerous. The insect tribe appears to be more numerous and less 1 Elphinstone's Kdbul, p. 144. 2 Bogra Kard, black breast, about the size of a grouse. 8 Katta.chap. iv.] language of iran. 83 known than the other branches of natural history.

In the gradual diffusion of mankind, the western provinces Languages of Iran appear to have fallen to the share of the Arameans tlTshemTtic. and Elamites, while the mass of the Cosssei, Ariani, Mardi, and other tribes, composing the earliest inhabitants, moved more eastward; leaving some of their numbers in the moun tainous districts, to mix with or become subject to the new comers. The Shemitic people and language having thus become dominant, instead of the Cushite, the ethnography of the former, rather than that of the latter, becomes an im portant consideration. From this primitive language, or rather from one of its cognates (as the Homyaritic may possibly prove to have been), two distinct branches were derived; the original Arabic, with the Musnad, Koreish, and Arabic, other dialects of that tongue, being one of these; and the Aramaic the other. The latter had two grand subdivisions; from one of which, known as the Western Aramaic, were derived the Amharic, 1 Syriac, Hebrew, &amp;c.; and from the other, or Eastern Aramaic, came the Assyrian, Babylonian, Aramaic, and Chaldean tongues. From its monosyllabic construction, the eastern seems to be more ancient than the western Aramaic, and it appears likewise to be the root of the Zend, Pehlevi, Sanscrit, and other dialects in use throughout a portion of the territory, along which it had spread eastward. Whether the first of these languages was once in general use, or was merely the sacred language 2 of Iran, the affinity of all of them is such as to imply a common origin. Pehlevi was 1 According to tradition, recorded by Abd-el-Malik, the Amharic was the language spoken in Mesopotamia soon after the deluge. 2 Zend, character, Avesta, language.—SixW. Jones's works.

The Aramaic probably a common language. the court language in the time of the Sassanian monarchs, and, according to some authorities, as far back as that of Cyrus: it contains many words which belong to the Chaldaic and Syriac tongues, and Sir William Jones was of opinion that one of these must have been its root; but it is now generally .presumed that the root of the Pehlevi is the Aramaic itself. The cognates of the latter spread westward and eastward, and one of them, the Chaldee, can scarcely be distinguished from the parent root. Another, the Parsi, being a softer language than the Pehlevi, became general in Farsistan, and gave rise to the Deri, or modern Persian. The Pehlevi, however, is still partially used in Shirvan, 1 and also by some of the Gabrs of the eastern provinces, as well as by a numerous section of the natives of India; but among the Parsees it is largely intermixed with the Hindustani and other native dialects, which are less or more connected with the Sanscrit. The affinity of the latter to the Parsi is so great that a learned philologist has pronounced it to be one of its derivatives. The number of words which are identical among the differ ent dialects of Iran, Turan, and some portion of the territory more eastward, goes far to show, that at a period anterior to anything like connected history, there must have been some common language; and this was probably the Aramaic. Per haps one-third of the inhabitants of Iran are nomadic, and this section, by its habits, as well as mode of life, constitutes a race separate from the other, or fixed portion; which, as we know, consists of Persians, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs, Jews, and Parsees. The religion of the last, or that of the Gabrs, naturally carries us back to that particular period, anterior to the time of the Magi, when the Iranians followed the Chaldean creed, which acknowledged one supreme, eternal, incomprehensible Being, the maker and governor of the world. At first, sacri fices were offered on the tops of mountains, without any other temple or altar; 2 and subsequently in the Mithraic cave. 3 1 Khanat of Tdlish.—Apenju des Possessions Russes, &amp;c., Tome III., p. 197, &amp;c. 8 Herod., lib.

IV.] RELIGION OF THE MAGI, ZOROASTER. 85 Then came the Magi, who held, that a knowledge of the Tenets of the Creator was only to be obtained by an intimate acquaintance Mdgl ' with his works; particularly with the movements of the heavenly bodies. These persons, being in possession of all the science of the age, acquired, in consequence, unbounded power over the minds of the people; they taught the worship of the sun, moon, and planets; they also inculcated reverence for parents, affection for the human race, and compassionate tenderness for the brute creation. 1 Zoroaster subsequently endeavoured to restore the purer Hormuzd and Chaldean doctrine of one immortal and beneficent Being limai1 ' (Zerwan), the Creator of the universe; and he added the contending principles of good and evil. Hormuzd represented the former, and under him, as his deputies, were angels pre siding over the months and days ; these were supposed to be assisted by the agency of the priests, who were to preserve in a pure state the four elements of man, of which light, the highest (represented by the sun 2 ), was the especial type of Hormuzd. Ahriman, or the evil principle, with his angels of destruction, was represented by darkness, over which the light was at length to triumph. 3 In the third century B.C., Artaxerxes endeavoured to purge Thyeiigion ^ the religion of the Persian sage from the corruptions intro- introduced, duced in the time of the Macedonians and Parthians, when there was bestowed on the symbol itself (fire) that devotion which was originally intended for the Deity only. The reli gion of Zoroaster continued to be that of the state until the flood of the Arabian conquest in the seventh century, when some of the so called Jaurs (Kafirs, or unbelievers) preserved their ancient tenets at the expense of a forced exile into Kir- man, or the countries more eastward; whilst the rest unwil lingly submitted. The sword of Muhammed was not to be successfully resisted; and the new doctrines were received in the divided forms now known as Sunnie and Slii'ah. After 1 Malcolm's History of Persia, Vol. I., p. 496. 2 Herod., b. I., c. 31, says, the Persians worshipped the sun, the moon, earth, fire, water, and the winds.

The Sunnies a protracted contest, the former sect (that of the Arabs) was and Shi ahs. established in the eastern provinces, and the latter in Persia Proper. The Sunnie belief is, that there is one immortal God, whose works are without beginning or end, and that he will be visible to the souls of the blessed: whilst the Shi'ahs deny the immortality of the soul, and maintain that the co-existent principles of Zoroaster will for ever contend for the mastery. Moreover, the latter regard Ali (son-in-law of Muhammed) and the twelve succeeding Imams as the succes sors of the Prophet; whereas the former consider as such, Abu Bekr, 'Omar, 'Osman, &amp;c. The Shi'ahs also enjoin pilgrim ages to Kerbelah, Mushed, Kum, and Ardebil, as well as to Mecca and Medina; but the Sunnies require that they should be made to the latter cities only. There is also a difference in the form and number of repetitions of the prayers; the ortho dox Turks praying five, and the Persians three times a-day. The Muiias. The ecclesiastical body of the Shi'ahs consists of a kind of pontiff, the Sheikh al Islam (ruler of the faith), who presides* over the executive duties, assisted by the three orders of priests; the lowest 'of which is the Mulla, who conducts the ceremonial of the mosques. The Mullas being a very numerous class, and forming part of every rank of men in Iran, from the courtiers about the throne to the poorest members of the wildest tribes, a brief notice of them may here claim a place. The title of Mulla is conferred on a candidate by some member of the order, after the requisite examination in theology and law, and the person is then entrusted with the education of youth, as well as the administration of justice, and the practice of law. 1 The Mullas sometimes possess suffi cient power not only to influence the people at large, but even the king himself. 2 Their occupa- Of this class of priests, those who have been successful in life are either placed in mosques or private families, waiting 1 Elphinstone's Kibul, p. 218. 2 The Mullas, and especially those who were Suids (descendants of the Prophet), brought about the last Russian war, by inflaming the people, in the first instance, and then appealing to the Shah to protect their religious interests.CHAP. IV.] HERESIES IN PERSIA. 87 for advancement; but a greater number are nominally attached to colleges, and live by the practice of astrology, fortune-tell ing, the sale of charms, talismans, &amp;c. They who are not possessed of the requisite ingenuity to subsist by the credulity of others, take charge of an inferior school, or write letters, and draw up marriage, and other engagements, for those who are unequal to the task; they mix at the same time largely in the domestic concerns of families. But in addition to these and other vocations, a considerable number of the lowest priests derive a scanty support from that charity which no one denies to the true believer. These men wander as fakirs from place to place; carrying news, and repeating poems, tales, &amp;c., mixed with verses from the Koran. The heterodox religions are very numerous; nor is Iran without her free- Freethinkers thinkers, as the Kaimurs and Mu'tazelis (Mitaulis), who and Heretics - deny everything which they cannot prove by natural reason. A third sect, the Mahadelis, or Molochadis, still maintain the Magian belief, that the stars and the planets govern all things. 1 Another, the Ehl el Tabkwid (men of truth), hold that there is no God except the four elements, and no rational soul, or life, after this one: they maintain also, that all living bodies, being mixtures of the elements, will after death return to their first principles. They also affirm that paradise and hell belong to this world, into which every man returns in the form of a beast, a plant, or again as a man; and that in this second state he is great, powerful, and happy, or poor, despicable, and unhappy, according to his former merits or demerits. In practice they inculcate kindness to, and respect for each other, with implicit obedience to their chiefs, who are called Pir (old men), and are furnished with all kinds of provisions for their subsistence. This sect is found in the provinces of 'Irak and Fars. 2 The Tarikh Zenadikah (way of the covetous) are directly opposed to the last on the subject of transmigration; and they believe that God is in all places, and performs all things. They likewise maintain, that the whole visible universe is only a manifestation of the Supreme Being; the soul itself 1 Ogilby's Asia, p. 70. 2 Ibid., p. 71.88 SUFFEEISM. ADAMITES. [CHAP. IV. being a portion of the Divine essence. Therefore, they con sider that whatever appears to the eye is God, and that all religious rites should be comprised in the contemplation of God's goodness and greatness. 1 The Suffees, On these various creeds the different branches of Suffeeism seem to have been founded; one of the most extraordinary of these sects is the Raushaniyah, the followers of which believe in the transmigration of souls, and the manifestation of the divinity in the persons of holy men. They maintain likewise, that all men who do not join their sect are to be considered as dead, and that their goods belong, in conse quence, to the true believers, as the only survivors. 2 Another sect, denominated All Ilahiyah, consider All as God himself; asserting, by way of proof, that he had several times killed, and as often restored to life, the only daughter of a woman, and that he was on that occasion accompanied by numerous angels. This sect is found in a village near Kum, but they are very few in number; and they are the more remarkable by their abstinence from tobacco and snuff, as well as for the use of wine and distilled liquors, and Adamites. The most remarkable religion, however, is that of the Adamites, who are described as meeting, both men and women, in a cave by night, and the lights being extinguished, promiscuous, and often incestuous intercourse follows. In these extraordinary rites may be recognized those which accompanied the worship of the Mylitta of the Assyrians, the Alitta of the Arabs, and the Mitra of the Persians. In addition to the preceding sects, there are likewise in Iran persons who may be considered as Pagans, and are said to worship the cow (Gao); and hence Gaor. Some of these are called Majusi, and others Gaor Yazdi. 3 Division of Throughout the greatest part of the East the same word eyeai ' equally means astronomy and judicial astrology; and the earth is still considered to be the centre of our system. The year is divided into twelve months, which are called by Arabian 1 Ogilby's Asia, p. 11 ; and Elphinstone's Kdbul, p. 207. s Ibid., p. 201. 8 Ogilby's Asia, p. Tl.CHAP.

The week is divided into seven days, and commences with our Saturday. 2 These periods, as well as the changes of the Astrological moon and the names of the planets, are accurately noted in 8u P er8tltlon8 - an illuminated almanack, which is generally carried about the person, in order to determine the lucky moment for any undertaking. A knowledge of astronomy, therefore, still forms the most influential part of religion in this country, since it enables the Minatzim at will to retard or encourage any proposed measure. The ancient inhabitants professed to have received their books on astrology from the Chaldeans; and this occult science had at its head the brother of Darius Hystaspes (Jam asp), who is pretended to have left a work containing an account of all the conjunctions of the planets before his time, as well as of those which were to occur in succeeding ages. 3 But in a country where the choice of the sovereign to rule from the Indus to the Nile has been determined by the neighing of a horse, 4 and in which the prince still remains for days before the gates, in order to enter his capital at the fortunate conjunction, it is not surprising that superstition should operate in many other ways. Thus the people have unbounded confidence in omens; a firm belief in the irresistible influence of good and evil spirits; a childish confidence in alchymists, in the expounders of dreams, and even in the lots cast by strolling fortune-tellers. Although these vanities formed part of the instruction, itThePe^a^^ is evident that, in the time of Xenophon, the education of educated, youth was carefully continued to the age of 16 or 17. 5 The 1 Muharam, Safar, Rabbi (first and second), Jamd(5 (first and second), Rageb, Sohaban, Ramaddn, Scevel, Dulcaida, and Dalbagich.—Ogilby's Asia, p. 71. 2 The names of the days are, Schembe, Seckschembe, Duschembe, Ses- chembe, Ischarschembe, Penschembe, and Adine, or Tzumah, Friday, the sabbath.—Ibid. 3 Hyde, Veterum Persarum et Magorum Religionis Historia; also Universal History, Vol. 'V., p. 415. 4 Herod., book III., § 86, ed.

The warlike successors of this monarch con tinued gradually to recover portions of the original territory; until, according to Cluverius, the kingdom of Abbas the Great, in 1636, had a part of the Paropamisian range to the north, the river Indus to the east, the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf to the south, and, finally, it had the river Euphrates and the great Caucasian range for its western and north-western boundary. 3 These limits are also given to Persia, about the same period, by another geographer (Gol- nitius), and likewise by two distinguished travellers, Herbert 4 and Chardin; 5 and, with the exception of the temporary loss of Kandahar by treason, 6 the Persian sovereign continued to laws, and the management of the bow and javelin.—Xenophon, Cyropsed., lib.

Since that period, however, a great change has taken place, in consequence of the loss of the rest of Affghan- . istan on one side; and, more recently, some of the fairest and richest provinces at the opposite extremity. There are now three great divisions of ancient fran, each of which belongs to a separate government. Affghanistan, the most distant of these sections, stretches Divisions of westward of the Indus, until, in the deserts of Kirman and trin ' Seistan, it touches the second division, or Modern Persia. The latter kingdom is now limited to the central space, and has a superficies scarcely exceeding that of the former territory; from which it spreads westward, gradually becoming narrower, till it terminates near Ararat. The provinces lost to Turkey and Russia, together, form the third division. The former of these fill up the space on the western side of the Shah's do minions, by extending from the Zagros to the left bank of the Euphrates; and the latter occupy the space eastward, between the left bank of the Araxes and the Caucasus, as far as the Caspian Sea. But as the three divisions of Iran contain many ancient provinces, and even kingdoms, to which the deepest interest is attached, it becomes necessary to notice the divisions particularly; and, in doing so, the precedence belongs to those parts which have occupied the first place in the history of the world. Chaldea and Armenia will, therefore, be the subjects of the following Chapter. 1 Ogilby's Asia, p, 2. London, 1763.

The tract of country first occupied by the Chaldeans was the mountainous district of the Chasdim, 1 or Alybes, in Central Armenia, a little way northward of Erz-Kum. We also find traces of this people in the names given to different places at intervals, westward of the source of the Euphrates, 2 as far as the banks of the Halys; and likewise in Babylonia, a part of which, together with the whole tract of country lying between the rivers, was designated Chaldea by some of the oldest writers, and more particularly Berosus, who speaks of a great resort in Babylon of the people inhabiting Chaldea. 3 It is intended in the second volume of this work to give some historical notices regarding the Chaldeans; and an distinguished, opportunity will then be taken to show that this people, or rather the Sabean followers of Cush, are to be distinguished from those descendants of Shem who, at a later period, occu pied part of the mountains of Assyria and the country west ward of the river Tigris; and to whom, though perhaps erroneously, the Chaldean name has been more particularly applied. 4 1 Chalybes and Mossynoeci, &amp;c.; and the former are now called Chal deans.—Strabo, XI., pp. 528, 529. 2 Chalybeans and Chaldeans.—Expedition of Cyrus, lib.

V.] THE CHALDEAN TERRITORY. 93 The territory of these Chaldeans extended to the northern Original extent extremity of Mesopotamia, and not only comprehended the of chaklea ' space between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, so as to in clude within it O'rfah, Haran, and most of the pashalic of Diyar Bekr, (the ancient Osroene,) but likewise a consider able portion of Kurdistan, in which, to this very day, we find their descendants, the Kaldani, living entirely apart. 1 East ward and westward of the Upper Tigris became the principal seat of the sons of Shem, after they had been driven by Nimrud into the higher country; although it was, in point of time, the second country which they occupied; and that part of it which is about the city of O'rfah is known to this day as Ur of the Chaldeans. 2 This designation, however, was not confined for any length its increase of time to the limits just mentioned ; for when the Shemitic sou branch regained in part its allotted territory south-eastward, on the decline of the Cushite power, the name of Ur was carried into Babylonia, where a powerful empire arose from the intermixture of the Chalybes and Kaldani. Established in a tract of country blessed with many agricultural and com mercial advantages, it is not surprising that the dominion of the Chaldees rapidly extended itself from the mountains of Armenia, along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, as well as the western shore of the Persian Gulf. Nineveh was at first the capital, and, 60 miles lower, there was another Ur ; 3 but subsequently the seat of the monarchy was trans ferred to Babylon. 4 In process of time, the name of the latter city was given to Restriction of 11 • /^n 'i j /• 1 the name. the territory itself, and tlie appellation Chaldea was contmea to one particular district 5 at the south-western extremity of this mighty empire, 6 of which the second Ur of the Chaldeans formed a very small part.

Being irrigated by the Pallacopas, this territory must, when the canal was in full operation, have been extremely fertile. At several places within it, as well as in Kurdistan, may still be found the descendants of the ancient Chaldeans, who speak, although in a corrupted manner, the original language of that people. Ancient and In Ptolemy's time, the name Chaldea was evidently applied m m ci 1 • a ^ rac t 0 f coun try touching the south-western extremity of old Babylonia, and extending from thence to the Persian Gulf, along both sides of the Shatt-el-Arab, and therefore including some of the territory lying eastward of Ur of the Chaldees. In this section of the country Ptolemy places the towns and cities of Shunda, Rahacharta, Shalatha, Atha, and Teredon, all on or near the river; whilst inwards from thence were situated Chumara, Bethara, Beramba, and Orchoe. Instead of these places, we now find the modern city of Bas rah, and the towns of Diwaniyeh, Imam-Ali, Lamlum, Semavah, Kut, Suk-el-shuyukh, Mujayah, Kurnah, Girdelan, Zobeid, Mohammarah, Wasit, and Kut-el-'amarah. Having briefly noticed the changing limits of Chaldea, we pass to that interesting and most ancient kingdom, of which the Cushdim territory before-mentioned (the Armeno-Chalybes of Pliny l ) formed but a small part. 2 A rmenia. Divisions of The upper Euphrates is nearly in the centre of the great range of territory called by the ancients Armenia, which ex tended eastward from that river to the Caspian Sea, and again westward over a part of Asia Minor. The former por tion was almost universally known by the name of the Greater, and the latter by that of the Less Armenia; but 1 Lib.

V.] SUBDIVISIONS OF ARMENIA. 95 both were sometimes subdivided into First, Second, and Third Armenia: a fourth division was added by Moses Choronensis and others. This last division, being on the eastern side of the Euphrates, constitutes in reality part of Armenia Major; while Armenia Minor is confined to the country westward of the Euphrates, and is composed only of the three subdivisions above alluded to. Armenia Major, in the time of its greatest prosperity, Extent and extended from 36° 50' to 48° N. lat.; and eastward, in one Armenia 68 of direction, from 38° to about 48° 40' E. long., with a surface of^ 0 '' nearly 84,756 square miles of diversified country. 1 The general limits of this territory will probably be best understood by considering the Euphrates to be its western boundary from Sumei'sat until a few miles south of Erzingan, where the boundary quits the river, and preserves the direction of Tarabuzun, till it meets the mountains southward of Gumish Khanah. There it takes a north-easterly direction along the range, till it skirts the northern extremity of the district of Kars, and from thence it passes onward to the river Kur, a few miles below Tifiis: from hence it follows this river to its estuary. After continuing along the Caspian shore for a short distance, the line of demarcation strikes into the interior in the direction of Tabriz, and the southern part of the district of Julamerik. It next passes south of Se'rt through the district of Diyar Bekr, and finally rejoins the Euphrates at Sumeisat. The district lying on the western side of the Euphrates, between Caesarea of Cappadocia and Pontus, was in early times called First Armenia. That which extended from Pontus to Melitene bore the name of Second Armenia; and Boundaries of the third, which had Cilicia to the south, and Second Armenia Minor'* 1 to the north, touched the Euphrates on the east, and extended westward beyond the towns of 'Ain-zarbah and Sis. As these three provinces, properly speaking, formed what was afterwards called Armenia Minor, or the territory westward of Euphrates, it will be sufficient, in describing the limits, to indicate the 1 Strabo makes it 200 schoens long by 100 wide, which would give a much greater superficies.—Lib.

This chain continues to be the northern boundary of Lesser Armenia, as it runs westward almost parallel to the Black Sea, till it reaches the river Halys, at a point not very distant from its estuary. From hence it runs S.W. along the river for about 180 miles and onward in the same direction till it meets the Taurus, 1 which becomes the boundary almost to the sea near Ayas. 2 Afterwards, the line sweeps round the south side of 'Ainzarbah 3 and Mar'ash, to the Euphrates at Siimeisat; and incloses a superficies of 70)778 square miles. According to the royal historian, 4 Armenia Minor for a brief period extended to the borders of Palestine, and one of its princes had the seat of his government at Bum Kal'ah.

The third is the independent territory of the Chaldeans, which lies S.S.E. of Lake Van, and N.N.E. of Miisul. And the fourth is the district of Envan, or that part of ancient Armenia which belongs to Eussia, and stretches along the river Aras. The elevated plateau at the foot of Mount Ararat, which contains the sources of the rivers Araxes, Phasis, Halys, Chorula, Tigris, and Euphrates, has already been noticed as 1 At a point about 60 miles westward of Koniyeh. 2 ' On the sea-coast,' says Marco Polo, ' the Armenians had a port, Giazzo, frequented by the merchants of Venice.' This was on the north side of the Gulf of Iskenderun, the present Ayds. 3 'Am-zarbah and Sis were alternately the chief cities of Armenia Minor, and at an earlier time Massis, or Messis, the ancient Mopsuesta, was the capital.—Page 41, Marsden's Marco Polo. 4 Haiton.chap. v.] face of the country. 97 forming part of Iran ; 1 and mucli of the country washed by those streams does not differ from the latter province in any important particular. The table-land above-mentioned is, however, remarkable, in being intersected by numerous deep water-courses and valleys, but more particularly for the numerous chains of mountains which branch out in many directions from Ararat, and are inhabited by an industrious race of peasants. The country in general, especially the slopes of the several chains of Taurus, may be said to be well wooded. Armenia possesses several fine sheets of water, such as lakes Fertility of Van, Urumiyah, Gouktcha or Sevanga, 2 near Erivan, and Armeilia ' many others of less note. It has the advantage also of being traversed by some of the noblest rivers in the world, which are fed by thousands of tributary streams, carrying fertility in every direction throughout its beautiful valleys. Owing to the height of the table-lands, and the extreme elevation of the mountains, the temperature of Armenia is much lower than that of other regions situated on the same parallels of latitude; but there is, notwithstanding, much variety in its climate and products. The soil is rich, and, instead of desert tracts, the unoccupied portions consist of rich pasture grounds, on which numerous horses 3 and other animals are fed. In the table-lands, and other parts of Armenia which are but partially cultivated, almost every kind of vegetable production is to be found. G rain, F ruit, and other P roductions. The wheat and barley are particularly fine ; nor is it very uncommon to have three successive crops of grain in some places. The gardens yield grapes in abundance, also oranges, peaches, nectarines, figs, apples, pomegranates, and other fruits. Honey, wax, manna, and gall-nuts are exported from the 1 Chap. iv. 2 Once Likhnit.—Apercju, &amp;c., Tome IV., p. 255. 3 Horses of Togormah.—Ezekiel xxvii. 14.

The scenery here is at once beautiful and strikingly grand from various points of view, as the mountains are seen rising abruptly from the sea to an elevation of4000 and 5000 feet, their sides being covered with dense forests, composed of gigantic chestnut, beech, walnut, alder, poplar, willow, elm, ash, maple, and box trees, with firs towards their summits, and a magnificent underwood of rhododendron, bay, hazel, &amp;C, 1 The less ele vated grounds produce cotton, hemp, tobacco, and raw silk in abundance; besides precious stones, such as the turquois, beryl, 2 crystal, pearl, and ruby. Besides the more valuable metals, gold and silver, Armenia abounds in copper, lead, iron, saltpetre, sulphur, bitumen, quarries of coal, marble, and jas per, with several mineral springs, which have been celebrated for many ages. 3 The chief exports of this neglected and almost unknown country consist at present of copper, which is carried to Con stantinople for the sultan; also iron, silk, cotton, wine, tobacco and gall-nuts. We learn from Strabo, that Pompey demanded as a contribution from Armenia 6000 talents 4 of silver; and we are told that the Romans, on reducing this kingdom to the rank of one of their provinces, carried King Alavasdus to Rome in golden fetters. 5 The rough clothing of the country people is manufactured in the villages: a kind of bombazine is still made at Erzingan. 6 At Mush and Mardin, says Marco Polo, 7 cotton is produced in great abundance, and the people prepare from 'it cloths called boccasine, with many other fabrics. The inhabitants, he continues, are manufacturers and traders, and are subject to the king of the Tartars. The same traveller likewise mentions, 8 that all those cloths embroidered with gold and silk which we call muslins, are the manufacture of Mosul; and 1 Mr. Brant's Journey, p. 5, and sequel. 2 Beryls are found at Coramagene, in the pasMlic of Diyar Bekr. 3 Strabo, lib.

V.] SOCIAL STATE OF THE PEOPLE. 99 we know from Kinneir and others, that they are still made in that city. The Armenians are exceedingly fond of foreign commerce and home trade, both of which are prosecuted with such success, that even the Jews are in many instances driven out of the field of competition. We find the industrious Armenians scattered over Arabia, Persia, and even the greater part of India in pursuit of gain. In the healthy territory of Armenia, we meet with fine- Pliability of looking peasants, of a powerful and robust frame, but rather character - dull and heavy in disposition. The people possess more of the passive and enduring than of the active qualities; and as the Armenian is generally without any fixed character of his own, he, from habit, moulds himself to that of his master or ruler, whoever that may happen to be. Consequently we find him in turn become Turk, Persian, Russian, or Kurd, according to the circumstances in which he happens to be placed. The Armenians have been described as brave, 1 a quality, however, which has long since passed from them; and we do not find that the people of this country have distinguished themselves in war since the days of Armenac, having been from that time either subject to other nations, or distracted by internal divisions. They are now a commercial and agricultural people; well Their dweiibg- clad, abundantly fed, and possessing sheep, cattle, and fine house *' horses in great abundance. They live in warm and substan tial houses, which are usually made of logs of trees, deeply covered with earth, and generally consisting of four or five apartments connected with each other. Two of these are allotted for the animals, and the remainder for the members of the family, who are commonly very numerous. A large portion of the building is formed by excavating the side of a hill, and in such situations the villages or hamlets are almost invariably placed. The towns are Van, Erivan, Nakhchevan, Kars, Bayazid, Bitlis, Amadiyah, Mush, Se'rt, and Diyar Bekr (Tigranocerta). 1 In former times, they were esteemed expert and brave soldiers.—Marsdeu's Marco Polo, p. 41.

Erz-Rum, or Garin, 1 is now the chief town, and one of great importance, from its position, althougli its population has been reduced, since the war of 1829, from 130,000 to less than 30,000; in consequence of a forced migration of the inhabitants into the Russian provinces. 2 frequently 117 The population of Armenia has always been considerable ; 3 subjugated, but from the nature of the country, which is subdivided into many small districts by its numerous mountains, valleys, and rivers, and from the inhabitants being composed of many different tribes, it became almost always an easy prey to the invader; and it has, in fact, been subdued successively by the Babylonians, Assyrians, Medes, Mongols, Parthians, Romans, and Turks. In consideration of their ready obedience and passive fidelity, the Turks prefer, as agents or servants, the Armenians to the Greeks, and, indeed, to any other people in the Sultan's dominions. They have also been partially engaged to serve as militiamen, and apparently with more advantage to the state than could have been expected, con sidering that want of spirit and activity by which they are generally characterised. The Armenians say that they were converted to Christi anity in the year 44, by Saints Bartholemy and Thadeus, who were put to death subsequently by the authority of Sanahughe, the reigning chief. 4 St. Gregory was the next gospel missionary ; and it was he who accompanied Tiridates, king of Armenia, to Rome.

It is watered by four navigable rivers, and pos sesses an abundance of cattle. 1 The people, he adds, were originally a colony of Phrygians. 2 But, on the contrary, Strabo, whilst he gives the tradition of their descent from Armenus (who had followed Jason from Thessaly into Armenia), adds, that the Armenians are in some degree relatives of the Thessalians. 3 Towards the east are Media Magna and Atropatena; to Ancient the north, the mountains of Parachoathras, which overlook Armenia, the Caspian Sea, and the country of the Albanians, the Ibe rians, and Caucasus. To the west are the mountains of Paryadres 4 and the Cydisses, as far as Armenia Minor, and that part of the river Euphrates which separates Armenia from Cappadocia and Commagene; 5 and finally the Taurus separates it from Mesopotamia. 6 Moses Choronensis 7 gives nearly the same limits. He says that Armenia Major is situated eastward from Cappadocia and Armenia Minor, and that the river Euphrates and the mountains of Taurus separate it from Mesopotamia.

The existing divisions may be considered as regulated by the extent of the pashalics of Erz-Eum and Kars, with the addition of the greater portions of those of Diyar Bekr, Van, and Erivan. The great cities were Artaxata, Vaspurcania, and Shemiramgerd, near lake Van. 1 The ancient capital of Hai-ass-tan was Ani; a city, the extent and magnificence of which is still much vaunted by the Armenians, who de light in saying that it contained 1000 churches and 100,000 houses. This immense metropolis was in the country of Shirag, 2 at the confluence of the Akhouran and Ehah rivers, which fall into the Araxes; where its site is marked by a double line of walls and numerous fragments of columns, &amp;c. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1319, and Kars then became the residence of the kings of the race of Payratides, as Nisibis was that of Tigranes; and finally Sis of the latest monarchs. The divisions of Armenia Major and Minor were, how ever, only made after the time of Antiochus the Great, or 190 years b . c.; and the dispersion of the Armenians over Asia and parts of Europe followed the Turkish conquest in the sixteenth century. 3 1 Visited by the late Professor Schultz. 2 Probably the Syracene of Ptolemy.

Babylonia , the first independent kingdom of the earth, was site of situated between the estuary of the Shatt-el-Arab and the BabyloTlia - western extremity of the river Khabur; and adjoining this lay the monarchy of Assyria, whose formation immediately followed that of the former kingdom, and was blended with it. The names of both Babylonia and Assyria still remain ; the former being more particularly applied to the south-eastern part of the pashalic of Baghdad, and the latter to a portion near the north-western extremity, from whence the name of Ashur (El Athur) spread to other countries, and more par ticularly to the tract under consideration, or Syria between the rivers, which name in a great measure superseded the older one of Babylonia. Contrary to the description given by some of the ancient geographers, as well as the strict meaning of the expressive term Aram-naharaim, Mesopotamia has been supposed to have its southern extremity at the Median Wall, instead of approaching the shores of the Persian Gulf. The shape of Mesopotamia, which is that of an isosceles104 ANCIENT LIMITS OF MESOPOTAMIA. [CHAP. VI.

Moreover, Strabo says the Tigris washes the eastern side its ancient of Mesopotamia, and the river Euphrates its southern and boutularies. 1 f . western ; whilst the Taurus separates it from Armenia on the north. 2 Pliny, who is still more distinct, says that Meso potamia has the Tigris to the east, the Euphrates west, the Persian Gulf south, and the Taurus north, with a length of 800 miles and a breadth of 360 miles, the city of Charax being at the extremity of the gulf. 3 its extent, Mesopotamia extends above 10° in longitude from Balis, in 38° 7' 10' east longitude, to the estuary of the old Karun, in 48° 45' 16'; and 7° 31' 5' in latitude from the shores of the Persian Gulf, in 30°, to Sumeisat, in 37° 31' 5' north lati tude ; its greatest width being about 170 miles from Jaber Castle to Hisn Ke'ifa, on the Tigris; and its extreme length nearly 735 miles. The irregular triangle thus formed has a superficies of nearly 76,117 square miles, including the shores of the Gulf from the Pallacopas to the old Karun. and mountains. As we have seen, the Taurus occupies the northern extre mity, and forms the limits of Mesopotamia on the side of Armenia. From the banks of the Euphrates, a little north ward of Munshar, 4 it sweeps round the plain of Siverik, dis playing rocky conical summits; and, under the name of the Karajah Tagh, it then takes an easterly direction, passing some little distance northward of Nisibis, and onward to the Tigris, which separates this chain from the bold and lofty precipices of Jebel Judi; 5 the principal groups being the Jebel Tur and the Baarem or Mardin mountains, with the 1 Strabo, lib.

Seventy miles southward are the Sinjar hills, which have a width of from seven to nine miles, and extend for about fifty miles towards the Tigris. 1 The isolated hill of Kaka seems to unite this range geologically with that of Abd-el-Aziz; a low chalk formation in the district of the Millis Kurds, towards the north-west, 2 which is the last to be noticed. The rest of Mesopotamia is a plain country, abounding it s southern with wormwood; but, between Baghdad and the Euphrates, part8 leve1, a part of the surface is occupied by salt lakes and marshes; and near the two rivers there are several khors, or fresh lakes, the most remarkable being those which inundate the neighbourhood of Akar Kuf, of the Birs Nimrud, (the Hin- deah,) and Lamlum. Some extensive sheets of water are also met with, at the season of floods, both above and below Kurnah. The soil of Mesopotamia is generally a sandy clay, the surface of which, in the absence of water, is a positive desert; but wherever it is watered by the numerous inlets and irri gating canals branching from the different rivers already described, it is rich and productive in the extreme. The change from a level to a mountainous country in a Temperature of higher latitude causes a marked difference in the temperatures parte? uthem at the opposite extremities of the province; whilst the central portion enjoys a climate which may be considered as a medium between the others. The southern or warmest region is Babylonia, which, under the Persians, was separated from the rest of Mesopotamia, and extended northward of the Median Wall, as far as the latitude of Sammara and A'nah. But even here the cold winds of the desert are felt during the winter, and especially in the beginning of the year, at which time rain is frequent, and even snow falls occasionally. This, however, is the season in which the operations of hus bandry and commerce are performed; for in summer an average of 104° (in the house) drives the inhabitants into 1 Mr. Forbes, Vol. IX.

VI. their Sard-abs, 1 as it once did the luxurious monarchs into the mountains of Media. This region is well adapted for the growth of cotton, sugar, indigo, and many of the fruits of a warm climate, especially dates, which, in the opinion of most judges, excel those of Tafilah, and are decidedly finer than any produced along the Nile. This superiority, how ever, applies to the dates of the lower Euphrates only; for in the neighbourhood of A nah the tree begins to have a sickly appearance, and the inferiority of the fruit is very perceptible to the north of that parallel of latitude. Temperature The next, or intermediate region, lies between 'Anah and of the central, or ag f ar as 350 latitude. This, like the preced ing, is almost entirely a dead level; and, from its soil, or more probably from the character of its inhabitants, it was con sidered as a part of Arabia. There is, however, here and there, chiefly along the river, some cultivation, intermixed with good pasture-grounds, the latter affording a sufficiency of herbage, except in summer, when the soil is burnt up by the sun. At this season the heat is very great, especially from mid-day till evening, but the nights are not oppressive. Lying near the borders of a mountainous country, the winters here are severe, and towards the northern extremity of the district they are attended by an abundance of rain, snow, and frost. About the Khabur, the date tree almost ceases to bear; but oranges, grapes, pears, apples, with other fruits and grain, arrive at perfection, and of the The third and last district comprehends, in part, the northern parte, northern slopes of the Mesopotamian branch of the Taurus. The eastern side, or the ancient Mygdonia, contains the vol canic ranges of Sinjar, Mardin, and Diyar Bekr. It enjoys a moderate degree of heat in summer, but the temperature is very low during the winter months. The western tract, the Osroene of the ancients, extends from the eastern side of the Khabur, and includes Rakkah, Haran, O'rfah, and Sumeisat, 1 Vaulted subterraneous apartments, with a high square tower (Badgir), acting like a wind-sail. The temperature is about 10° lower than that of the coolest rooms above ground.CHAP. VI.] VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL PRODUCTIONS. 107 being hilly rather than mountainous, and at the same time but little cultivated: it differs considerably from the preceding district, especially as to temperature; for the inhabitants experience what has been so expressively called by Humboldt an extreme climate, the thermometer being as high as 110°, under a tent, in July, and 8° below zero in winter, with a continuance of snow for some weeks during the coldest part of the latter period. In the summer, and during the greater part of autumn, there is scarcely any rain in Upper Mesopo tamia ; but during the remainder of the latter season, and till the snow is melted in the lower part of the neighbouring range of the Taurus, it falls abundantly. This region, like the district southward of the Khabur, abounds with the ordinary kinds of grain; and the fruits of a warmer tempera ture, such as oranges, grapes, and pomegranates, (which are particularly fine,) walnuts, pistachios, and other products of a colder region, are equally good. The country about Port William has, at one season, the aigrette, the parrot, stork, wild fowl, flamingo, bustard, and the turdus Seleucus, of which the last feeds on that scourge of the country, the locust. These are succeeded, at a later period, by wild geese, ducks, teal, swans, snipes, tern, and the cinereous vulture. 'Anah, Rahabah, Mardin, Mosul, Arbel, Koi Sanjac, Ker- kuk, Teknt, Suleimaniyah, Zohab, and Khani-kin, are subject to the pashalic of Baghdad; of which, however, Mesopotamia constitutes the most important portion: but, a few years back, O'rfah was included, and sometimes also Diyar Bekr. The northern part, or that above the capital, is known to the Arabs as A1 Jezireh, or the Island, and the remainder as 'Irak Arabi; both of which, and the former especially, being much esteemed for the excellency of the pasture, as well as the fertility of the soil. The products of this region are tobacco, Indian corn, wheat, barley, cotton, large quan tities of fine wool, goats -hair, with the addition of gall-nuts and yellow berries in the mountainous parts to the north. The fruits are grapes, melons, apricots, figs, cherries, pome- Fmits. granates, quinces, pears, and dates, all of which are abundant wherever the least care is taken to cultivate them. The pre- p 2108 wild and tame animals. [[chap. vi. vailing trees are the sycamore, the silver poplar, with the tamarisk and liquorice plants, both of which are everywhere very abundant. Below the Khabur, wormwood covers the plain. Bustards abound; and even the wild asses are still occasionally seen traversing the country with their well-known swiftness. 1 Jackalls are found in large troops; lions and hyeenas are not so numerous; but hares, black and stone-coloured part ridges, francolins, bramin and common wild geese, ducks, teal, pelicans, cranes, &amp;c., are abundant. The rivers are full of fish, chiefly barbel and carp, which latter grows to an enormous size in the Euphrates. Truffles and wild capers, peas, 2 spinach, and the carob, 3 are also found in Mesopotamia. Com. The country produces great quantities of barley and wheat, in their wild as well as cultivated state, but oats do not seem to be sown anywhere by the sedentary Arabs. Onions, spinach, and beans, are the usual vegetables, and these are largely cultivated along the sides of the rivers, where, just after the water recedes, the progress of vegetation is surprising. Some idea may be formed of the productive qualities of the soil, from the fact of eight crops of clover having been cut in the neighbourhood of Basrah during the year. 4 animai!fand domestic animals of Mesopotamia are camels, horses, minerals. buffaloes, sheep, and goats, all of a superior kind ; but the cows and oxen are of an inferior breed.

The chief manufactures are slippers, shoes, boots, some Employments silks, coarse cottons, the abbas, or cloak, universally worn by of the people ' the Arabs, the gaily striped kerchief of silk and cotton mixed, which is invariably used to cover their heads, and the coarse black tent, which forms the dwelling-place of a large portion of the people throughout the year. To these manufactures may be added some elegant embroidery on cloth and leather, with other ornamental work of a like nature. A great num ber of sawyers and carpenters are occupied in preparing tim ber, and in the construction of edifices and furniture of that material; and a still greater number of artizans are employed in making or repairing the ordinary culinary utensils of copper and tin. To these may be added a limited number of indivi duals who find occupation as gold and silversmiths in the bazaars of the principal towns, making seals, rings, and the more ordinary ornaments for women. During the last twenty-five years, the pashas have succeeded in drawing to the capital almost the entire commerce of the country. Fleets of large well-built boats descend and ascend the Tigris with cargoes to and from the Persian Gulf; but the mass of the trade is carried on by caravans, which branch in different directions from this great emporium. From Persia and Kurdistan are brought silk, coarse wool- imports, lens, shawls and carpets of Cashmere, Kirman, Yezd, &amp;c. ; stuffs, gum-rahabat, fur-skins, tobacco, rose-water, galls, dyes, &amp;c.

Besides these expenses, considerable sums of money are privately distributed, in order to secure the allegiance of some of the sheikhs ; 2 and subsidies are paid to all chiefs from whom any service is required. There is, however, in peaceable times, a considerable surplus, which must be consumed when the Arab tribes are called out; and it is understood that nearly 100,000 men may be assembled on due notice being given, provided the necessary payments are previously made to the chiefs. 3 1 As many as 500 high-bred horses are annually sent to India. 2 The details regarding the revenue and expenditure of Baghdad were fur nished in 1831, by one of the Europeans who had been in charge of the grana ries and books. 3 Previously to his march in order to assist in the defence of, Baghdad, the Montefik sheik received a present from UaVd PdsM of 10,000^.CHAP.

Grane, or Quade, Mohammarah, and Basrah are the ports; and the last, being the principal, is next in importance to Baghdad, the capital, which has been already noticed. The inhabitants consist of Arabs, Osmanli Turks, Kurds, Religion. Turkomans, Syrians, Jews, and Christians. Arabic is the general language; Turkish, Kurdish, Chaldee, Syriac, and the Syro-Chaldean dialects being the exceptions. The Sunnie Muhammedan religion is prevalent; but in Upper Mesopo tamia there are many Christians of the creed of Nestorius, (some of whom have become Roman Catholics,) and Jacobite as well as Roman Catholic Syrians. There are besides two remarkable sects, one of which, called the Mendajaha, (dis ciples of John,) is found scattered in small communities in Basrah, Kurnah, Mohammarah, and, lastly. Sheikh el Shuyukh, where there are about three hundred families. Those of Basrah are noticed by Pietro de la Valle, who says the Arabs call them Sabeans. 1 Their religion is evi dently a mixture of paganism, Hebrew Muhammedan, and Christian. They profess to regulate their lives by a book called the Sidra, containing many moral precepts, which, according to tradition, have been handed down from Adam, through Seth and Enoch ; and it is understood to be in their language, (the Chaldee,) but written in a peculiar character. They abhor circumcision, but are very parti cular in distinguishing between clean and unclean animals, and likewise in keeping the sabbath with extraordinary Page 244.112 THE MENDAJAHA, OR SABEANS. [CHAP. VI. strictness. The Psalms of David are in use, but they are held to be inferior to their own book. They abstain from garlic, beans, and several kinds of pulse, and likewise most carefully from every description of food between sun rise and sunset during a whole moon before the vernal equinox ; in addition to which, an annual festival is kept, called the feast of five days. Much respect is entertained for the city of Mecca, and a still greater reverence for the pyra mids of Egypt, in one of which they believe that their great progenitor, Saba, son of Seth, is buried; and to his original residence at Haran they make very particular pilgrimages, sacrificing on these occasions a ram and a hen. They pray seven times a-day, turning sometimes to the south 1 and sometimes to the north. 2 But at the same time they retain a part of the ancient worship of the heavenly bodies, adding that of angels, with the belief that the souls of the wicked are to enjoy a happier state after nine hundred cen turies of suffering. The priests, who are called sheikhs, or chiefs, use a particular kind of baptism, which, they say, was instituted by St. John; and the Chaldee language is used in this and other ceremonies. 3 )S ed The strict preservation of this tongue, (which of itself de- [ajL? e no tes a separate origin from the Arabs,) together with the particular connexion between Palestine and the ancient people of Upper Mesopotamia, make it possible that these Sabeans may be descended from Sheba, son of Ketura, which would account for the great respect paid to the residence of one of their idolatrous ancestors (Terah). Ben Schunah calls the Sabeans Syrians, and adds, they use the language of Adam in their books ; 4 and another writer, Ibn Koura, says their reli gion is the same as that of the old Sabeans. 5 In our inter course, we found them to be quiet and harmless, but exceed ingly cautious, and unwilling to communicate, except with Mr. Rassam, who was almost considered as one of themselves. 1 Egypt. 8 Hdran, 8 From MS.

Yezidis, is, in some respects, like the Mendajaha, but with the addition of the evil principle, the exalted doctor, who, as an instrument of the divine will, is propitiated rather than worshipped, as had been once supposed. The Yezidis reverence Moses, Christ, and Muhammed, in addition to many of the saints and prophets held in veneration both by Christians and Moslems. They adore the sun, as symbolical of Christ, and believe in an intermediate state after death. The Yezidis of Sinjar do not practise circumcision, nor do they eat pork; but they freely partake of the blood of other animals. Their manners are simple, and their habits, both within and without, remarkable for cleanliness. They are, besides, brave, hospit able, sober, faithful, and, with the exception of the Muham- medan, are inclined to tolerate other religions: they are, however, lamentably deficient in every branch of education. Polygamy is not permitted, and the tribes intermarry with each other. The families of the father and sons live under the same roof; and the patriarchal system is carried out still further, each village being under its own hereditary chief. 1 Amongst these mountaineers, Mr. Forbes heard of the practice of certain rites by their co-religionists, the most noble of the Izedi tribes; whose chief temple is at Sheikh Adi, People of eastward of the Tigris. Their temporal and spiritual head, sheikh Adl Sheikh An, resides at Bagh-Idri, in Nav-kur; and their churches are plain buildings, without peacocks, images, or anything else to distinguish them, except the bitumen fires of their annual festival: and it is now ascertained by Mr. Aiiisworth that they are quite as simple in their manners and conduct as the other Yezidis. Another traveller says they have a high regard for Chris tians, use baptism, make the sign of the cross, put off their shoes at and kiss the threshold of a Christian church, believe in one supreme God, and in Christ, in some sense, as a Sa viour : their religion contains also a remnant of Sabianism. 2 1 Mr. Forbes* Visit to the Sinjar Hills, Vol. IX.

Indeed, the Armenians assert that the Yezidi, or Izedi, are descended from the ancient Syrians and Chaldeans. 1 Population. In addition to the Yezidis and other fixed inhabitants, there is a very considerable population of the Shamar Arabs and of the smaller tribes, who live almost entirely under tents, and wander from place to place, as their flocks require pasture: these, together with the residents of the towns and villages, make an aggregate of about three and a half millions of souls living near the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates. 2 The chief government is conducted according to the Turk ish practice; but among the Arabs in the rural districts, the patriarchal system prevails.

Fragments of buildings scattered for some distance, at a spot 23 miles E. by S. from Bir, indicate that the former was of considerable extent. But the only objects of particular interest are two colossal unfinished lions, at Aulan Tagh, about eight miles southward Seroug. of Seroug, one of which was sketched by Lieut.

The West Gate of Haran, drawn by Lieut. Eden, R.N. Haran, the resting-place of the patriarch on his journey to Palestine, is called a city of the Sabeans, 3 and it had a sovereign as late as 1199 ; 4 but the scarcely less ancient city of O'rfah took, and still retains its place. 1 Strabo, lib.

Babylonia. The existence of the Babylonian kingdom previously to the formation of that of Assyria has been indicated by Herodotus, who mentions that the people were acquainted with naviga tion, 3 with the situation of the pole, the use of the sun-dial, and the division of the day into 12 parts. 4 The scriptures, however, carry the history much further back, by showing that the followers of Cush usurped the supreme power in Babylonia; and the extent of the kingdom which they formed may be imagined from the situation of the cities of Nimrud. Babel. The ruins near Hillah are still, by the Arabs, designated Babel; and all historical records, as well as traditions, agree in representing these as the remains of the first city of Nimrud; the Babylon of Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and other historians. The Birs Four miles and a quarter N. 20° W. of the bridge of Hillah is the Mujellibeh, near which are the remains of Kasr, as well as those of the hanging gardens; and at rather more than six miles from Hillah, standing amidst, and crowning the summit of extensive masses of ruin, is the Birs, or Baris Nimrud. This has been considered by Niebuhr, Rich, and others, to be the celebrated temple of Belus; and, according to Herodotus, it was separated from the palace by the river. 5 In Lower Babylonia, 82 miles S. 43° E. from the same place, and at 8 miles N. 53° E. of the castle of Muwaserah, are the mounds of El Assayah, or the Place of Pebbles, which 1 The Surna of Ptolemy. 2 Mr. Ainsworth's Journey, Vol. XI.

From these Erech. names, as well as other circumstances, Colonel Taylor has been induced to conclude that the ruins are those of Erech, the second city of Nimrdd. They are near the Karayim canal; and their effect on the serene sky of this country was particularly imposing, when viewed from a distance of about thirteen miles, as the steamer approached the bed of the Chaldean lake in 1836. A ccad. Extending to a considerable distance round the colossal Accad mound of Akar Kuf, (the Akari Nimrud and Akari Babil of the Arabs,) situated 55 miles N. 13° W. of Babel, may be traced the remains of a city, of which this mound, like those of Babel and Erech, was probably the high altar, or Baris ; 1 and the name, as well as the primitive construction of the pyramid, may serve to identify the ruins as those of Accad, Nimrud's third city. C halne. At the extremity of the plain of Shinar, and near the foot of the Sinjar mountains, we find on the banks of the Khabtir, near its confluence with the Euphrates, two extensive heaps 1 See Ainsworth's Assyria, &amp;c., p. 175.118 limits of babylonia. [chap. vi. of ruins, partaking of the same characters as those which appertain to the preceding cities. That on the right bank (the presumed Kerkisyah) is crowned by the modern town Abu Serai, (father of palaces;) whilst that on the opposite or left bank may, from its name, Kalneh or Chalanne, and the more modern Charchemish, be the fourth city of Nimrud. 1 Limits of Babylonia. The remains just mentioned indicate that the ancient king dom of Babylonia comprehended a narrow tract along the river Euphrates, extending from the neighbourhood of Erech, or from about the modern town of Sheikh el Shuyukh, to Babel; a distance of about 154 miles in a direction westward of north, and continuing from thence 287 miles further, in the same direction, to Kalneh, on the Khabur. The king dom extended eastward till it joined Assyria, including Akad, and two other cities no less remarkable. One of them bears the name of El Kush, 8 and the other is the supposed site of the antediluvian Sippara, 3 which is within the Median wall, near the southern extremity. The greater part of what was called Mesopotamia in latter times constituted, therefore, the territory of ancient Babel, the Aram-naharaim, or Syria between the rivers, of the scriptures. 4 The same tract also bore the name of Padan Aram, 5 or Champagne Syria; both of which designations agree with the description given of the country by Strabo. 6 The ancient inhabitants of this part of Asia were called Syrians, as some suppose, because it formed part of the government of Syria Proper; but it is more probable that the appellation was derived from the Assyrians, who, by placing themselves in the plains near Nineveh after the dispersion, were the 1 Benjamin of Tudela writes Chalne, or Dakia, at the beginning of Senaar, or Mesopotamia.—See Benoit, p. 29. 4to.

Strabo says that Semiramis and Ninus were Syrians; and he calls Nineveh itself the metropolis of Syria. 1 A ncient A ssyria. Athur (from Asshur, Shem's son) was originally of small Assyria, extent, and formed the second part of the kingdom usurped by the giant warrior 2 who built, or rather restored, the three cities, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen, besides the capital, Nineveh. The ruins of the latter city are sufficiently known to the general reader, from the descriptions of Rich, Ainsworth, and earlier travellers. They are in Assyria Proper, on the left bank of the Tigris, opposite Mosul, and the natives still call them by the original name. Of the three former cities, the brief notices which imme diately follow comprehend all that the researches of travellers have been able to discover. On the right bank of the Euphrates, at the north-western extremity of the plain of Shinar, and three and a half miles S.W. of the town of Mayadin, are extensive ruins around a castle, still bearing the name of Rehoboth. 3 In several old maps, we find Calah marked at someCakh. distance eastward of the river Tigris ; and Major Rawlinson appears to have identified the ruins of Holwan, situated near the river Diyalah, and about 130 miles N.E. of Baghdad, with those of this ancient city. 4 There are also fair grounds for supposing that the extensive ruins which lie between Nineveh and Calah, or Holwan, 5 near the village of Derawish, 22| miles S.S.E. of Mosul, and 1 Geography, lib.

These sites partly determine the limits of ancient Assyria, which, when independent of Babylon, was bounded on the north by Mount Niphates and part of Armenia; on the east by that part of Media which lies towards Mounts Chaboras and Zagros; on the south by Susiana, as well as part of Babylonia; and, finally, on the west by the river Tigris. According to Ptolemy, Assyria Proper contained the pro vinces of Calachene, Arapachites, Adiabene, Arbeletes, Apol- loniatis, Sittacene, and Chalonitis; in which are the rivers Tigris, Lycus, Caprius, and Gagus. 2 The chief towns were Nineveh, Mespilla, or Meso-pulai (Mosul), Larissa (Resen), Arbela (Gobil), Dara (Dura), Curcha (Kerkuk), Sammurra, Opis, Artemita, Halus, and Al- batia. 3 In some instances, the ancient sites may still be recognized, but by far the greater number are unknown; and the cities of this once splendid empire are feebly represented by the modern towns of Mosul, Se'rt, Amadiyah, (the town of the Medes, 4 ) Bitlis, Van, Arbil, Suleimaniyah, Kerkuk, Koi-Sanjak, Zakho, Rowanduz, and Julamerik.

The The Kaidam, Kaldani people, according to their own account/ were con verted to Christianity by St. Thomas and two of the seventy disciples. By means of a rigidly enforced system of exclusion, they have preserved their freedom as a republic; their religious tenets and simple liturgy have also remained nearly unchanged since the moment that the blessings of the Gospel were introduced into their secluded valleys. Almost every village has its priest, and likewise a church of peculiar simplicity, in which, a little before daylight, and fasting, the Kaidam of each sex assemble, on Sunday, for divine worship. This is a vaulted building, without steeple or belfry, and sometimes in front of a cave. Its interior walls are covered with printed calico, and it is without seats, images, pictures, or ornaments of any kind: the whole complement of the service consists of manuscript copies of the New Testa ment and liturgy, a brass cross (different from ours), a small bell, a copper chalice and paten, with an incense chafing-dish. Having purified their hands in the smoke of frankincense issuing from the last-mentioned vessel, the priest, clothed in wide trowsers, a shirt, and a cotton surplice, administers to each individual the sacred elements of bread and wine: he then proceeds, in Chaldee, with the ritual which concludes the service, and the people kiss the minister's hand as they and their social retire to their dwellings: there is, besides, another sacrament, state ' that of baptism. Fasts are frequently kept, and all kinds of meat are strictly prohibited to the clergy after ordination; but celibacy is not enjoined on the priests, bishops, or patriarch. The last dignity, with its temporal and spiritual power, is hereditary. A constant state of warfare, or of preparation to resist attacks, has rendered the Chaldean ferocious towards enemies, and even towards peaceable strangers; but the knowledge of Christianity, imperfect as it is in that country, has, notwith standing this and other faults, made him superior to the Asiatics of the same class who follow the Muhammedan 1 Collected during Mr. Ainsworth's recent visit.—Vol. XI.

The women are neither covered like other easterns, nor secluded from social intercourse. The men are loosely clad, wearing sandals of chamois skin, and a peaked woollen cap, behind which their hair falls in one plaited tress. The diet of the people is almost entirely vegetable; their houses are scattered along the sides of the mountains, amidst groups of fruit and other trees, and are clean and commodious. But in summer time they remove their families to sleep on an elevated platform, inclosed like an immense bedstead. By a natural mistake, the Chaldeans have been confounded with a schismatic branch; who, to the great annoyance of those who consider themselves the orthodox party, adopted, and have preserved, the doctrines of Nestorius.

Towards the eastern extremity of this sea of mountains, the peak of Rowanduz towers to the height of 10,568 feet, and the view from thence towards the north-west is in the highest degree magnificent, especially in the direction of the distant sources of the Zab, where the summits rise to about 15,000 feet. 1 The numerous tributaries of this river and those of the Assyrian Khabiir, like the Diyalah and Kerkhah, rise beyond the high chains, and force their way through them in many directions: the intercourse from side to side is by means of rope-bridges. 2 The general elevation of Kurdistan , and the height of its mountain ranges, secures the province from the scorching 1 Collected during Mr. Ainsworth's recent visit. 2 Mr. Ainsworth's Visit to the Chaldeans.—Vol. XI.

The forests, in addition to the ash and oriental plane, have the finest walnut trees in great abundance; and the oaks bear large gall-nuts of the very best quality. The honey, which is found in holes under ground, or in hives made of mud, is remarkably fine, as well as very plentiful; and it produces a fragrant wax in such quantities that it forms a constant article of export, with the gall-nuts, yellow-berries, goats' hair, &amp;c. In addition to these, the valleys likewise grow silk, cotton, tobacco, hemp, pulse, wheat, barley, rice, Indian corn, flax, sumach, sesame, and the castor-oil plant. Melons and pumpkins grow to an enormous size; and flowers of all kinds, particularly the gigantic rose, are abundant. But the most remarkable production in ancient Assyria is the celebrated vegetable known here by the name of manna ; 2 Manna, which, in Turkish, is most expressively called Kudret-hal- vassiz, or the Divine sweetmeat. It is found on the leaves of the dwarf oak, and also, though less plentifully, and scarcely so good, on those of the tamarisk, 3 and several other plants. It is occasionally deposited on the sand, and also on rocks and stones. The latter is of a pure white colour, and appears to be more esteemed than the tree manna. 4 It is collected chiefly at two periods of the year; first in the early part of spring, and again towards the end of autumn; in either case the quality depends upon the rain that may have fallen, or, at least, on the abundance of the dews; for, in the seasons which happen to be quite dry, it is understood that little or none is obtained. In order to collect the manna, the people 1 Excellent wine and brandy are made near Bitlis.—Kinneir, p. 394. 2 Exod. xvi. 15, 31, 33, and 35; Numb. xi. 7. 3 Tarfa, in Arabic. 4 Mr. Rich, Vol. I., p. 142, seems to think this is another kind of manna; but Mr. Rassam, from whom my information is chiefly derived, considered it to be the same, with the simple difference of being free from the leaves and other impurities taken up with it, when shaken from the trees or plants.

An article of larch, tamarisk, and several other kinds of shrubs, the manna is shaken down in such quantities from the branches as to give a supply for the market, after providing for the wants of the different members of the family. The Kurds not only eat manna in its natural state, as they do bread or dates, but their women make it into a kind of paste; being in this state, like honey, it is added to other ingredients used in preparing sweetmeats, which, in some shape or other, are found in every house throughout the East.

In the natural state it is described as being of a delicate white colour. It is also still, as in the time of the Israelites, like coriander seed, 1 and of a moderate but agreeable sweetness. 2 Indeed, Calmet, who says it is met with not only in Arabia, but also in Poland, the mountains of Lebanon, and other places, compares it to condensed honey. 3 Burck- hardt, however, says, it is of a dirty yellow colour, slightly aromatic, of an agreeable taste, sweet as honey, and, when eaten in any quantity, it is purgative; he adds, that the time of collecting it lasts six weeks, and that the Arabs esteem it as their greatest dainty. 4 KurdiSrf Kurdistan the camel is but little used, owing, no doubt, to the mountainous nature of the country, for which he is but ill suited; but his place is amply supplied by other animals. The goats and sheep are met with in large flocks, and the wool of the latter is particularly good, provided it is carefully washed. The buffalo is not so common as in the plains; but oxen and cows are abundant, and of full size ; they are used almost universally to carry light burthens, chiefly of corn, which is balanced over the back of the animal 1 Numb. ii. 7. 2 Mr. Rassam. 8 Calmet's Dictionary. 4 Burckhardt's Tour in the Peninsula of Mount Sinai.CHAP.

The people of this country call themselves Kermanj, 1 the Manners ami European name being unknown. 2 Almost every Kurd, or of the Kerad (speech), is mounted, and armed generally with a gun and sabre; but higher up in the mountains he is to be seen pro tected by stout leggings, clad in loose robes, with a showy vest beneath; on his head is a gay-striped turban, hanging loose in a fanciful manner on one side, and he is mounted on a spirited horse. Occasionally he is provided, as in ancient times, either with javelins about three feet nine inches long, which he hurls at his enemy with great dexterity, or else with a bow made of horn, nearly six feet long, and slung at his side ready for use, with a supply of arrows in a leather quiver at his back. The bow resembles that of the Turcomans, and is much more effective than that which is in use amongst the Beels 3 in India. The arrow of the Kurd is, apparently, what it was when Xenophon crossed the Centrites:—' Sometimes, also, the barbarians, after the Greeks had ascended, gave them great disturbance in their descent, for they were very nimble; and, though they came near to our men, yet still they got off, having no other incumbrance than their bows and slings. They were very skilful archers; their bows were nearly three bows and cubits in length, and their arrows above two. When they ari ' ows ' discharged their arrows, they drew the string by pressing upon the lower part of the bow with their left foot. These arrows pierced through the shields and corslets of our men, who, taking them up, made use of them instead of darts, by fixing thongs to them. This day they staid in the villages situated above the plain that extends to the river Centrites.' 4 In addition to the javelin and bow, the sling 5 mentioned by 1 Aper^u, &amp;c., Tome III., p. 28'7. a Ainsworth's Visit to the Chaldeans.—Vol. XI.

Of these three weapons, the javelin continues most in use ; but even this, like the bow, and the sling, has given way, except in a few instances, to the use of fire-arms. The Kurds consider it to be either a mark of disgrace, or a symptom of extreme poverty, to be seen on foot; and, there fore, they are not only almost invariably mounted, but accus tomed to move from place to place in large bands, always well prepared either for attack or defence.

But when the first salutation has taken place, it is immediately discovered that this formidable array is rather intended for defence than attack; for the Kurds, having ascertained that the presumed foes are really peace able, generally become so themselves, and not only allow the traveller to proceed unmolested, 1 but appear willing to per form any acts of kindness when needed. In fact, the Kurds, like most other Eastern people, the mountaineers especially, are really hospitable ; they will readily share their house and its rough fare, such as bread made of acorns, &amp;c., with those who chance to become their guests for the night.

They usually consist of three or four dark rooms on the ground, communicating with each other, and separately allotted for the family, their cattle, sheep, goats, &amp;c., an arrangement which appears to have been resorted to as a protection from the severity of the winter; and, being suited to the climate and limited wants of the people, this mode of constructing houses has remained unchanged since the passage of the Ten Thousand Greeks through the country. 1 The Turks, as well as the Persians, obtain for their cavalry a great many horses from Kurdistan, which, according to some estimates, might annually supply from 60,000 to 80,000 of these animals; but such numbers could scarcely fail to drain the country entirely, if the demand were to be kept up year after year, without intermission. The Kurdish houses, being formed in the sides of the mountains, possess a degree of comfort, as to temperature, which could not be obtained in ordinary buildings. After sun-set, a bright lamp and a large wood fire supply that light which is sparingly admitted during the day through one or two small windows, usually closed with oiled paper instead of glass. The Kurdish women do not cover their bodies so much with apparel, nor do they keep so much by themselves, as in other parts of the East. Cooking, and other domestic duties, devolve upon them, as usual; but, at intervals, they join the guests, and the rest of the family circle, round the blazing hearth. There are many different tribes in Kurdistan, and these are generally divided into small chieftainships, forming sepa rate patriarchal governments, under an hereditary chief, called Dereh-Beg, 2 who possesses an extensive tract of land, which, in all probability, has been in his family for many generations. The rent-charges drawn by the local chieftain from the people are on a moderate scale, and the taxes paid to the Sultan do not appear to be by any means oppressive. We have seen already that there is some commerce in 1 Xenophon's Expedition of Cyrus, book IV. 2 Lord of the Valley.128 POPULATION. [CHAP. VI. tobacco, honey, gall-nuts, as well as other productions of the country; and there might be much more if the people had any wish to create wants, or even to indulge those already known. The desires of the Kurd seem to be limited to the posses sion of an excellent horse, with substantial clothing, and a sufficiency of the ordinary food of the country, of which milk forms a large proportion. Therefore, if contentment be in reality wealth, the people of this country seem to possess it; and, so long as this state of things continues, they may be considered a happy race. Of the population of Kurdistan it is difficult to speak, with any degree of precision, in the present state of our knowledge; but it appears to be thickly peopled, considering the moun tainous character of the country ; such is certainly the case in those parts which have been examined by Mr. Rich, 1 Major Rawlinson, and preceding travellers. The Sekkir, Niir-ed-din, Shinkis, Gellates, Bulbasi, Jass, Mikris, together with the Bahdinan tribes under the prince of Amadiyah, and Rowanduz, make up an aggregate of about 400,000 souls; to whom must be added a large nomad population, and the numerical strength of many, as yet, unvisited districts. The number of the Chaldeans and Nestorians proves to be much under the estimate made previous to Mr. Ainsworth's visit to their country; but still it may be presumed that the population of Kurdistan, west of Zagros, amounts to about 2,500,000, or, perhaps, rather more; and a smaller number would scarcely bear a fair proportion to the horses and other cattle which are known to exist in the country. Having thus briefly glanced at ancient Assyria, we pass on to a tract of territory lying farther north. 1 Rich's Kurdistdn, Vol. I. p. 153.( 129 ) CHAPTER VII. russian provinces.

I n 1724, the territory south of the Caucasus was invaded by p e ter the Great Peter the Great in person: this prince, having taken Derbend, takes Derbend - entered into a treaty with- Persia, by which, in return for the provinces of Daghestan, Shirvan, Ghilan, Mazanderan, and Aster-abad, he was to recover, from the Afghans, the do minions of Shah Tamas. These conditions were not fulfilled, and the provinces in question were held till Nadir Shah recovered them from the Empress Anne in 1735, when the Georgian territory reverted to the government of its own princes. After the death of Shah Tamas, in 1783, the then reigning Heraciim a sovereign, Heraclius, in consideration of his dominions being Rugg? a of guaranteed to himself and his successors, declared himself a vassal of Russia; and, by this fatal step, he laid the foundation of the ruin of his dynasty, and of the independence of the country. This event took place soon after the demise of George XIII., the son and successor of Heraclius: in 1801, Georgia was declared to be a province of Russia; 1 and, in 1 By Ukase, September 12, 1801. vol. i. s130 GEORGIAN PROVINCES, MOUNTAINS. [CHAP. VII. 1803, there was added the Khanat of Gandja (Elizabeth- pol). 1 At the close of the Persian war in 1813, the Khanats of Sheki, Shirvan, Karabagh, Talish, Baku and Derbend were also annexed to the Russian empire. 2 Again, by the treaty of Turkman-chai, Persia ceded the territory northward of the river Aras; and, finally, by that of Adrianople, in 1829, Russia obtained the pashalik of Akhltskha'i, with the castles and some districts hitherto retained contrary to the stipula tions made at Akerman in 1826. The districts thus acquired at the northern extremity of Fran now form the separate government of Georgia, or Grusia, as the principal province is called by the Russians. The country has nearly the figure of a lozenge, or, more properly, a rhomboid; it lies chiefly southward of the Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian Seas, having around it the territories of Persia and Asiatic Turkey. Its greatest length, from Astara 3 to the banks of the Terek, or Kuma, 4 is about 280 geographical miles; and its width, from the coast of Abasia 5 to the southern side of the peninsula of Apsheron, 6 is 417 geographical miles ; and it has a superficies of 56,007 square miles. 7 The Caucasus. It is intersected by numerous offsets from the Caucasian range, which forms the natural line of separation between Europe and Asia. This stupendous chain presents, along the Black Sea, a succession of lofty peaks, which rise to the height of 12,000 or 13,000 feet; 8 and, with the exception of three difficult passes, it forms an unbroken barrier, consisting 1 Apercju, &amp;c., Tome I., p. 216, &amp;c. 2 Ibid. 8 In 38° 23' N. latitude, the extreme southern limits as fixed by the Treaty of Turkman-chai', April 2, 1828. 4 In 43° SO 7 N. latitude. 8 At the mouth of the river Enguria, in about 41° 35' N. latitude, as ceded by the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829. 6 In 50° 40' E. longitude. 7 680 versts by 420 versts, and 169,854 square versts.

It is composed of granite and porphyry, flanked by schistus and ridges of limestone, pierced, as usual, by numerous water courses. 1 Towards the eastern extremity inferior branches are sent, in different directions, into Persia, whilst other off sets, from the opposite extremity, either skirt the shores of the Black Sea or enter Armenia; and one of the latter, but of inferior elevation, may be said to connect this vast chain with the mountains of Ararat. The territory contains extensive plains and well-cultivated Soil, &amp;c., of valleys, and, generally speaking, it has a rich soil, which is Georgia ' amply watered by the rivers draining the basins eastward and westward of the summit level in Central Armenia. But owing chiefly to the irregularity of the surface within the limited space of 3° 45' of latitude, an extraordinary difference of temperature is experienced ; some parts being covered with snow, whilst others, within 50 miles, yield the products of a tropical climate. 2 Daghestan occupies the north-eastern extremity of the Extent of territory, filling up the space from the crests of the Caucasus 31)aghestan ' to the shores of the Caspian, 4 and from the borders of Shirvan to the river Terek ; an extent of 2° 50' in latitude. Within these limits are included the districts of Baku, Kuba, Der- bend, Tarku, Karakaitakh, and Tabasseran, which, together, give a superficies amounting to nearly 5996 square miles, and consisting partly of plains, but chiefly of mountains, as the name itself signifies. 5 Daghestan is covered with mountain peaks belonging to the numerous offsets from the Caucasus; these separate deep valleys as they traverse the province in a south-easterly direc tion towards the plains lying along the Caspian Sea.

Three of these arms may be distinguished from the rest: the most northern penetrates Tarku in an easterly direction, and on its crest, near the Caspian, stands Tarku itself, the capital of the district. The second and central offset terminates with the city of Derbend and the Albanian Gates; and, lastly, the southern branch traverses Kuba, in which district it terminates near the sea with the remarkable mountain of Bechebarmak. Derbend, Karakai'takh, Tarku, and Tabasseran, are very mountainous; but an open country commences with the plain of Kuba : this extends about 25 miles southward of the river Samour, and almost 40 miles westward, from the Caspian Sea to the mountains; 1 and it presents, everywhere, a rich soil, which bears most abundant crops. The mountains westward inclose some level tracts, but of very limited extent, with the excep tion of the plain of Hiobdon, which is nine miles square. 2 Bituminous^ Southward of the Mount of Bechebarmak are the mineral ' districts of Baku and Apsheron. Around the capital of the former there are nearly 100 bituminous springs, some of which are worked, and these afford, in addition to petrolium, an inexhaustible supply of black and white naphtha ; whilst other fountains have, for ages, emitted a burning stream, which is known by the name of the Indian fire. 3 Over these spots have been erected the principal temples of the Guebres; and Baku, in consequence, has become the Mecca and Medina of Parsee pilgrimage, and Apsheron. The peninsula of Apsheron is equally remarkable for its salt formation, the usual concomitant of bituminous beds. In different places there are ten salt lakes, only one of which is worked, and this yields, notwithstanding a defective manage ment, 10,000 tons of salt annually. The eastern shores of Daghestan are washed by the shallow waters of the Caspian, and along the coast are numerous small islands. The district of Baku has but one permanent river, the 1 Aperqu des Provinces Russes, &amp;c., Tome IV., p. 96, &amp;c. e Ibid., pp. 96 to 98. 8 Ibid., pp. 89 to 91.CHAP.

The districts of Tabasseran, Kara-Kai'takh, and Tarku, are still more amply watered by the Gouriene-chai, the Bouam, the Khamanda, the Darbakh, and the Ghemri-Ozen; also the Koisson, the Tarkali-Ozene, the Tcherkies Ozene, the Boni- naki, and the Rousse Boulakh, &amp;c. 2 In the neighbourhood of Baku the soil is sandy and sterile, and on the sides of the mountains westward it is likewise poor, yielding a scanty supply of grain; but in Derbend and Kuba the plains and valleys are covered with a rich black loam. Daghestan has three kinds of climate. That of the plains is warm and unwholesome. The medium climate prevails along the slopes of the mountains, which, owing to a more moderate degree of heat, are healthy; and this is still more decidedly the case in the highest and coldest tracts, where the third climate prevails. 3 Exclusive of the unproductive district of Baku, and the lis animals,&amp;c. more arid portions of the mountains, the animal and vegetable productions of Daghestan are nearly those of Europe, with the addition to the former of tigers, panthers, camels, and buffaloes; and to the latter of silk, cotton, tobacco, madder, naphtha, and saffron. 4 These products, in addition to the fisheries of sturgeon, turtle, &amp;c., give a considerable export trade to Persia and Russia ; 5 the value of which, however, is greatly exceeded by that of the imports. 6 The province contains many villages, but very few towns. At its southern extremity is Baku, the capital of the district of that name, which is fortified, and has a citadel on the north-west side, containing the palace of the ancient chiefs. 7 The population consists of nearly 7000 Tartars, living in badly built houses with flat terraced roofs.

Town of Kuba, adjoining district, Kuba, has likewise but one town, which bears the same name: it is fortified, and contains 654 ill-constructed houses ^ but it is in a picturesque situation, being surrounded by mountains, and overlooking the river Koudial. Derbend, the most important city of Daghestan, is at the extremity of one of the great arms already noticed as branch ing from the Caucasus ; and, by its position on a steep and almost inaccessible ridge, overhanging the Caspian Sea, it at once commands the coast, road, and the Albanian pass. The cityofDer- town contains 1795 well built stone houses, 2 inclosed by a substantial parapet wall, and it has the additional defence of the citadel of Narini Kal'ah, the supposed work of Alexander, which stands a little higher than the rest of the town, and communicates with the latter through a single gate. Rose-water and opium are prepared by the inhabitants of Derbend, in addition to copper and iron vessels, and the manufacture of silk and ^woollen stuffs: but a shallow and defective harbour greatly restricts their commerce. The Albanian The Portse Albanise bear the name of the Iron Gates among the Arabs 3 and Turks. 4 By the Persians they are called Siril Alsaghabe, or the Golden Throne: the words Der and hend, in Persian, signify a narrow closed passage. 5 Wall of Kitai. Derbend, which, according to D'Anville, represents ancient Albania, had the additional security of the wall of Kitai', which, like many other extraordinary works, is attributed to Alexander, though constructed at a period later than that of the Macedonian king, as a defence against the inroads of the Scythians, who occupied the country towards the north. This massive work was 21 feet high by 7 wide, and ex tended from Derbend to the river Irkisohe; or, according to tradition, to the pass of Dariyel itself. The existing remains are those of the third wall, which was constructed by Shah Nushiravan, in the sixth century. 6 Tarku, the last city to be noticed, is between the rivers Manasse and Ozene, at 2^ miles from the Caspian Sea; and 1 There are 3572 Tartars.—Aperqu, &amp;c., Tome IV., p. 141. 2 There are 8543 Tartars, 225 Armenians, and 461 Jews.

The people call themselves mountain Tartars, and their long drinking cups, made of cows'-horns, with a disposition to be boisterous while they indulge in the inebriating liquor called brega, 2 favour this opinion; while the use of low tables, and some other customs, seem to indicate that they are of the Median or Babylonian race. The Lezgi, Trousc, Tatte, and other dialects of the Tartar Dialects and tongue being, in Daghestan, mixed with the Armenian, Per- Religion - sian, and Hebrew, 3 it is probable that settlers from each of the nations speaking those languages were the immediate ancestors of the people of that country. Their religion is that of Muhammed, and they are divided into Shi'ahs and Sunnies; among them are many Armenian and Greek Christians, with a very limited number of Jews. 4 The people of the towns and plains are of middle size, strong, and active. They are careful agriculturists and in dustrious fishermen ; and, in character, they much resemble the Persians, particularly in a disregard of truth, and a disposition for theft and intrigue. 5 The mountaineers and nomadic tribes have a Tartar physiognomy; they are also taller and more active than the people of the plains. In general, they are brave ; and, being always armed, they Character of are ready to prove their courage by engaging in fatal combats the people ' on the slightest occasions. Taking revenge for injuries, and the practice of hospitality, are held to be imperative duties. Like the Jews, the husband can at pleasure give the talagh, or writing of divorce, to his wife, who is then obliged to quit his roof, leaving her children behind. The most laborious work falls to the women, whilst the men are occupied in the sturgeon fishery, in rearing horses, camels, &amp;c., and in making' occasional forays on the lands of 1 Aperc^u, &amp;c., Tome IV., p. 187, &amp;c. 2 Made of barley, and resembling mead. * 8 Aperqu, &amp;c., Tome IV., pp. Ill to 129, and pp. 151 to 187. 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid., pp. 36 to 38.136 SHIRVAN—MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS.

Up to a recent period, this people sold as slaves the captives taken in war, and occasionally their own children; and this practice is even now followed in some of the Caucasian districts. The civil government of Daghestan is regulated by the Koran ; the sons of a family inherit equally, enough being set apart to give to each of the daugh ters half a share; and hence the proverb that one man is worth two women. 1 Extent of With the dependencies of Talish and Sheki, the adjoining territory of Shirvan occupies the space between the Caspian Sea, Daghestan, Elizabethpol, the river Kur, and Azerbaijan. From the last, in 38° 31' north latitude, it extends about 135 miles, to the limits of Daghestan, in 40° 44' north latitude ; and from the river Kur, eastward, about 110 miles to the Caspian Sea, in 40° 20' north latitude. Including the district of Salian, it has a superficies of 10,386 square miles; 2 and on the eastern side it consists of plains, whilst towards the west it is very mountainous. The latter portion is traversed from north-west to south-east by the abutments of the Caucasus, from which other branches run southward to the Kur, and again along the western side of Talish: the culminating points are the crests of the Cau casus, the Baba Tagh, Fite Tagh, Boz Tagh, Akhdib and Khanabat Taghs; 3 all of which are of granite resting upon limestone, with some flint and clay towards the plains. 4 Face of tbe The eastern side consists of an extensive plain, having the bifurcation of the Aras (the island of Salian), and the banks of the lower part of the Kur in its centre: from thence it spreads northward, along the shores of the Caspian, to the district of Baku, and southward almost to the extremity of Talish. Towards the west there are also some level tracts, but of limited extent, such as the plateau of Aftaran, the 1 Aper&lt;ju, &amp;c., p.

The river8 • northern valley has a width of about 20 miles, and extends nearly 52 miles westward from Shirvan Proper, to the terri tory of Elisooy, at the foot of Boz Tagh. 1 The central valley, which is more elevated than the other, lies between the Boz and Aghdib Taghs, and is about 45 miles long by 18 wide. The third constitutes the southern part of Sheki, and has about 38 miles in length by 32 in width, between the Kur and the foot of the Akhdib Tagh. 2 The Caspian forms the eastern limits of these districts, the interior of which are amply watered by the affluents of the Araxes, the Kur, and other streams. Southward, the Bolgharon, after separating a part ofTalish from Persia, runs eastward through the plain of Moghan, till it is lost in a reedy tract near the lower Araxes. 3 The other waters in this direction are the Karaiar, the Ghorussan, the Odinabazar, the Lankan, &amp;c., with their affluents. 4 Northward of the Araxes are the Gokh-cha'i, the Gherdiman, the Akh-su (White Water), the Aighry (Crooked Water), the Pirsaghate, the Touriane, and the Demir Aparane. Nearly all the rivers run from the north to the south, and, with the exceptions of the Aras and Kur, are usually fordable after the spring months, 5 In general the soil of the plains consists of a black loam.

Notwithstanding a con siderable degree of heat, the second climate (along the slopes of the mountains) is healthy; and higher, in the third or cold climate, where the snow remains till May, the inhabit ants live to a considerable age. 1 Animals. Besides tigers, panthers, bears, wolves, boars, jackals, &amp;c., Shirvan has an abundance of buffaloes, camels, arid other tame animals, which, on the approach of summer, are removed with the inhabitants to the fine pasture and wholesome air of the mountains. These flocks, the fisheries, and agriculture, con stitute the riches of the people. Their exports are equivalent to an annual sum of about 268,500/., 2 and their imports to nearly 232,900/. 3 Towns. Shirvan has but few permanent villages, and, besides Shamahkee, the capital of the province, only two or three towns, as Nookha, the capital of Sheki, and Salian. The latter town occupies the extremity of the angle formed by the bifurcation of the Araxes. It is small, but important, owing to the sturgeon fishery. 4 shamahkee. Shamahkee occupies some elevated ground nearly in the centre of Shirvan Proper, and it contains a population of about 11,000 souls, who are partly Persians and Armenians, but chiefly Tartars. The Russians reconstructed the city on a regular plan; and it now includes the usual proportion of bazaars, karvanserai's, baths, and churches, in addition to 2233 houses partly within the fortifications. 5 About 25 miles to the south-east are some ruins, which, according to tradition, are those of the ancient capital.

The new capital was founded by Nadir Khan in 1734: it was razed by Fetti-Ali Khan in 1766, but it was rebuilt in 1777 ; and since 1805, it has been subject to Russia. 1 Nearly two miles westward of Shamahkee are the remark- Ruins of Ki*. able ruins of Kiz-Kal'ah, whose walls occupy the summit of ^ al ah ' an isolated rock, shaped like a truncated cone. In this are some ancient galleries, and a remarkable cave, 49 feet long by 21 feet wide, and 7 feet deep, which probably was excavated at a remote period. Tradition assigns Kiz-Kal'ah (Castle of the Virgin) to the ancient chiefs of Shirvan ; for whom, as well as their harems, it served as a retreat in case of invasion, and likewise during the oppressive heat of summer. 8 The eastern or champagne portion of Talish contains many Taiish. villages, as Khizilaghatche Arkivan, Alvadi, Badalane, Ali Abate, &amp;c.; but not being drained, these places are unhealthy. The capital itself, Lenkoran, is merely a dirty village, with 422 houses for the Muhammedan people, and 48 for the Armenians; but all are badly built. Besides one mosque, there are two bazaars, and a superior class of buildings, which have been constructed in the vicinity for the Russian autho rities. As the roadstead is shallow and unsafe, Sara is now the port of Talish; and being sheltered by the island of that name, and deep as well as commodious, it is the principal station of the Russian war flotilla on the Caspian Sea. The inhabitants of Shirvan consist of bekris, or nobles, Population of priests, merchants, artisans, cultivators, and shepherds ; and, 811,1 va '- lastly, the nomadic tribes, who amount to one-fourth of an aggregate population of 256,581 souls, 3 descended chiefly from Tartar, Persian, Armenian, and Hebrew stocks.

T 2140 MANNERS AND GOVERNMENT. [CHAP. VII. Language. Manners and Customs. Local govern ment. The Tartar language 1 prevails, but the Armenian tongue is likewise common : there is also a dialect composed of these two. The Hebrew, which is spoken in this country, is much mixed with the Persian. 2 The people of the plains and towns resemble in character the Persians; but the mountaineers, or more ancient inhabit ants, are very different. The descendants of the Tartars are silent and cautious in their conduct: although hot and vin dictive, their courage is not of a high order, and they are deficient in firmness and perseverance. Their chief amuse ments consist of horse, and gymnastic exercises, in which they excel; and, unlike other easterns, they take all the laborious household tasks, leaving to the females needlework and other light occupations. The softer sex have not, however, been improved in their morals by thus occupying their proper position in society; for though modest in outward demeanour, the women of the mountain districts lead irregular lives. 3 Kuba, Baku, and the other Khanats, are subject to local princes (mirzas), one of whom is elected supreme governor, with the title of Shamkhal (Syrian prince). This choice is determined in a very primitive manner; for the chiefs being assembled, the priest throws a gilded apple amongst them, and the individual whom it happens to strike undertakes the sovereign functions, 4 which he exercises at Tarku, the an cient seat of government, almost without control. The city has a population of about 10,000 souls ; but it was much more important before its destruction by the Russians in 1725. The whole tract lying between the Caspian Sea and the rivers Araxes and Iverne, which includes Derbend, Kuba, Baku and Sheki, formed part of the territory of the Amazons. 5 It likewise constituted that part of the country of the Arii which touched the Caucasus, and it corresponds to the Media of Herodotus 6 and Strabo. 7 This name is derived by the 1 This appears to be a mixture of the Turkoman and Persian tongues.— Aperqu, &amp;c., Tome III., p. 61 to 91. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid 4 Ogilby's Asia, p. 40. 5 Ibid., p. 49. 6 Lib.

This territory formed the eastern and principal part of Albania; a kingdom in which 26 languages were spoken, and sufficiently powerful to oppose Pompey with 72,000 men. 12 It likewise formed part of the immense empire of Armenia; 13 but the present name of Shirvan only dates from the conquest by Khosroo Nushiravan in the sixth century.

The mineral productions are naphtha, copper, emery, and salt. The animal productions resemble those of Shirvan, but are far more numerous; and the abundance of forest game, such as bears, elks, panthers, wolves, foxes, and jackals, caused the woods in this district to be the favourite hunting- ground of the late prince-royal. The rich pasture-grounds are intermixed with vines, fruit-gardens, and fields of tobacco, silk, flax, wheat, maize, millet, and cotton; and most of the other parts of the district are covered with those fine forests of oak, plane, poplar, cypress, elm, ash, birch, fir, beech, and walnut trees, from which the Tartar appellation Black Garden was derived. 5 1 Aper9u, &amp;c., Tome III., p. 255 to 258. 8 Ibid. 3 Ibid., p. 259 to 263. 4 Ibid., p. 253. 5 Ibid., p. 255 to 258.CHAP.

It is inaccessible on three sides, and the fourth is fortified. The population consists of 5289 Armenians, and 4572 Tartars. Though the fisheries of the Araxes and Kur are good, the flocks numerous, 1 and the vegetable productions abundant, Karabagh being without manufactures, it has no commerce, unless the local interchange and sale of commodities may be so called. The villages are very inferior, and the houses, besides being badly constructed, are dark, and usually filled with smoke. The inhabitants of the province consist of Tartars, Ar- and inhabitants, menians, Kurds, and Boscha (gipsies), numbering in all 98,614 souls ; of whom 25,137 are Tartars. Here, as in Daghestan, the Tartar and Armenian languages prevail; but the Nestorians use a particular dialect, and the Kurds another, called Kourilien, which is a compound of Tartar and Turkish. Syriac is also in use. The religions are the Muhammedan and the Christian: of the former, besides the Shi'ahs and Sunnies, there is a third sect, called the All Ilahiyah ; 2 and of the latter, the followers belong to the Armenian and Nestorian (locally called Nass- ran) churches. 3 The people consist of nobles, begs, and agas ; priests, the Character of maas (individuals who, for services, have been exempt for a tlie pe()pU ' certain period from taxation), and peasants or townspeople. Abandoned, for the most part, to listless idleness, the inha bitants only differ from other northerns by their black hair, and tall, handsome figure. 4 The Kurdish nomades are fierce, courageous, and inclined to drunkenness. The Tartars and Armenians, on the con trary, are sober, but not particularly courageous: the former are inclined to theft, the latter to trickery and imposture; and both are so economical as to be often clad in tatters. 5 1 20,000 horned cattle, 100,000 sheep, with goats, horses, camels, &amp;c.— Aperqu &amp;c., Tome III., p 281 to 301. 2 See p. 88. 3 Apercju, &amp;c., Tome III., p. 266 to 287. 4 Ibid . 5 Ibid.144 ARMENIAN DISTRICTS.

Some of the Nestorians, 2 who live apart in the mountainous country which separates Turkey from Persia, say that their ancestors were Greeks. The different tribes of Kurds appear to be the descendants of the Parthians who were dispersed over Assyria and Mesopotamia; and a f dialect of the Syriac is still preserved amongst these wanderers.

The Persian dominion suc ceeded, and that of the Turks followed. This continued till the country was recovered by Nadir Shah. In 1809 it came under the government of native khans, and it so remained till, in 1822, it became subject to Russia.

Between the Araxes and Ararat the country is marshy, and again, in other places, clayey; but the greatest part of it con sists of a rich black earth.

This village occupies part of the site of the ancient city of Vagharshabad and is further remarkable for the adjoining convent of U'ch Kilisa, or the Three Churches (St. Kaiane, Choghakate, and Echmiyadzin) ; the convent, which is the residence of the Armenian patriarch, is eight miles westward of Erivan. According to tradition, its antiquity, the present capital, the Terva of Ptolemy, occupies the spot first seen by Noah after quitting the ark, and also that which the patriarch had occupied previous to the deluge. 2 But the Armenian historians, with much more probability, attribute its foundation to Ardachasse, the eleventh sovereign, who reigned 103 years b . c. The territory once called Godaikh 3 derived its present name from the city; but Echmiyadzin, being the seat of the ecclesiastical government, has always held the first place among the Armenians, whether they were under the Turks, Persians, or Russians. The population of the pro vince consists of 58,423 Armenians and 48,494 Tartars, who are dispersed in the different villages.

In general the pashalik enjoys a moderate and healthy climate; it possesses, also, a great many mineral springs with medicinal properties, besides the ordinary vegetable productions and animals; the sable and the tiger are among the latter. Silk and cotton-stuffs, oil, drugs, trinkets, steel, and tobacco are imported from Turkey; and untanned skins, iron and copper vessels, silk and woollen-stuffs, are sent in return. 1 The Russian Sanjaks of Akhltskhai, Atskhver, Asspinz, Khertvisse, and Akhalkalaki, with the fortress of the latter, contain 103 villages, in which there are 11,800 Armenians, in addition to 7200 persons consisting of Kurds, Jews, Boches (gipsies), Tartars, and Karapapakhs, so called from their lamb-skin caps. A certain number of Armenians pro fess the Catholic religion, and the rest the Armenian. The other inhabitants, including the greater part of the Georgians are Muhammedans; and the language of the latter is spoken in all its purity. The capital is divided into two parts, the old and the new towns, which are separated by the river Poskho; and the ancient fortress is supposed to have been constructed by the Georgians in the time of Queen Thamar.

It is well watered by the Rhion, or Phasis, and its tributaries; and, being sheltered by the Caucasus on the north, the climate is mild: although mountainous, the country yields the pro ducts of warm climates; but in certain places the forests engender malaria. It is divided into the districts of Kutai's, Vahi, Shoropan, and Rachi, each of which is locally governed by an intendant, who is assisted by two native officers. Kutais, on the Rhion, the only town of Imiretia, scarcely contains 2000 inhabitants: this is the residence of the Russian governor, who commands the districts westward of Georgia, but is himself subject to the governor-general of the trans-Caucasian provinces.

The latter province has a superficies of almost 900 square miles, chiefly of forests, 2 lying between Mingrelia, the Black Sea, and the Turkish possessions. The soil is very fertile, and the products similar to those of the neighbouring countries. It is divided into two districts, each having a town of the same name ; viz., Ozoorget and Nagomar; and there is, besides, the important fortress of Poti at the mouth of the Rhion.

Ancient These provinces formed part of ancient Colchis, which was peopled by one section of the Moschi, the supposed Meshech of Scripture. 1 From Casluchim, Cumberland derived the name of Colchians, 2 whose position was along the Phasis and Euxine Sea, near the Sarapani. 3 Their country was famous for its flax and manufactures of fine linens; 4 and it was a kingdom before the Argonautic expedition. 5 Colchis has always been celebrated for its fine timber and productive mines of silver, gold, and precious stones ; and its honey still produces the effects experienced by the Greeks ; 6 this seems to be accounted for by the abundance of hellebore, on the flower of which the bees delight to feed.

The climate in winter is mild, and in summer moderate. The soil is good, and the country is well watered. There are some mineral springs in each district, and copper mines have been recently discovered in Kazakh. The timber in both attains a large size; and vegetable pro ducts, as well as animals, are abundant. The two circles of Bambak-Shuragel and Bortchalin lie between Kazakh and Kars. The former extends southward, from Bortchalin to the district of Erivan, and has a diversified surface. sh^cTei and Bambak, the central portion, contains about 709 square miles, and consists of a valley 23 miles long, inclosed by two chains of mountains. Shuragel lies southward of these chains, and has about 423 miles of surface, which consists of plains, with mountains at intervals ; and northward is the plain of Lory, which is surrounded on all sides by mountains, and contains 1650 square miles. The soil, climate, and pro ducts vary considerably; and the inhabitants consist of 2008 Tartars and Greeks, with 28,668 Armenians, of whom 21,207 were transported from Erz-Rum and its vicinity after the Turkish war of 1829. 1 In the territory there is but one town, Ghoumry, which is in the central district of Shuragel, on the banks of the Arpah-chai, and contains 503 houses. 2 Soil, climate, Bortchalin contains 2640 square miles; it lies between Bortchalin.

Towards the eastern side there is an extensive plain, and elsewhere there are others of small size; there are, besides, several small valleys. It is watered by the Kur, the Khram, the Alghete, and other streams; it contains, also, a great many lakes full of fish. In general the soil of the district is good, but the climate varies, and fever prevails in the lower parts of the country.

Karketia extends westward from Sheki to Kartelinia on Extent of the Kur; and it has the crests of the Caucasus, with part 0 f Karketia - the Lezgi country, on the north; its superficies is about 4800 square miles, and it contains two principal districts, Signakh and Telav. The former lies at the eastern side, and has Telav on the Signakh dis- west, Djaro Belokane on the north, the territory of the 1 ™*' Sultan of Elis on the east, and the Kur on the south and south-east. Towards the north it is mountainous, and con tains the summit ridge of the Caucasus, of which the most elevated peaks are to the N.E.; but along the river Yori there are extensive plains. The climate of these plains is warm and unhealthy in summer, and mild in winter; but a severe cold prevails in the elevated districts. Mineral springs are found in the country, and forest trees are abundant. Madder is cultivated, in addition to other vegetable products. The population consists of 49,371 Georgians, 6204 Armenians, with 1106 Tartars. Signakh, the capital, is fortified, but it is small, and is neither well situated nor handsome. Telav is the western portion, and it has the crests of the Soil, climate, Caucasus on the north; on the east it has Signakh, and on the west Duchet and Tiflis. To the S.E. the province has mountains and forests; and again, towards the north, there is a limestone range running parallel to the crests of the Caucasus. The soil is a mixture of clay, chalk, and black earth ; and the district is watered by the Alazani and the Yori, with their numerous affluents. The climate of the elevated districts is good; but fevers prevail in the lower parts, near the banks of the Yori, where the temperature is high. The forests, the vegetables, and the animals, resemble those of the adjoining district.

To the north their limits are snow-clad, and the rapid river Araghva flows on the side of the Khersourians. The district contains thirteen villages, with a population of 3698 souls, and it can furnish 700 armed men. But the people are more peaceably inclined, and are not so brave as their neighbours the Tuchians. Their domestic animals are very numerous. The Khersourians are situated on the crests of the Caucasus, and are surrounded by the Ghoudmakars, the Kistes, Boghasser, and Didajens. They are in a half savage state, and less peaceable than the Pehavians, or even the Tuchians; their favourite occupations being pillage or theft. There are 29 villages and 2670 inhabitants, who are in a constant state of hostility with the Kistes. 1 Kartelinia extends from Kakhetia to Imiretia and the pro vinces of the Akhltskhai; and northward, from the Bort- chalin and Tiflis district to the territories of Gora and Ossetia.

Kartalmia is mountainous, having, towards the north, an elevated limestone chain, running parallel to the Caucasus, and gradually diminishing in height towards the Kur, where there is an extensive plain. There is also a considerable plain towards the east, in Gori. On the western side there are three large rivers, the Ksan, and the Araghva, 1 first and second, with numerous tributaries; there are also the Narckvavi, the Arghoun, the Medjouda, and several others. And towards the eastern side are the Kur and its affluents, the Liaja, the Medjouda, the Lekhoura, and the Ksan. The soil is not equal to that of the other provinces, yet it is very productive. Much of the surface is covered with oak, walnut, and other fine timber of various kinds ; Pr o ductlon8 ' ' , and town8 - and, in other parts, hemp, madder, tobacco, and grains, are cultivated with success. There are but two towns: Gourie is on the borders of the eastern province, and is situated on a plain close to the left bank of the Kur; it is defended by a fort, and contains one Greek church, three Georgian, three Armenian churches, and 600 houses.

Lezgistan lies between Georgia and Daghestan, along the two sides of the Caucasus. Including both the northern and southern slopes of this portion of these mountains, it has a surface of about 10,000 square miles, which is occupied by the Avars, Zerkers and other tribes, who are subject to the Lezgi. The great central road leads from the western side of Georgia by the celebrated pass of Dariyel, 1 which is so named from a fortress situated on a rock washed by the river Terek. The Caucasian Dariyel, called by the Georgians Shevis Kari, or the Gate of Shevi, is, without doubt, the celebrated Caucasian Gate ; a prodigious work of nature, says Pliny, formed by abrupt pre cipices, and having the interval closed by gates with iron bars.

The people, therefore, chiefly depend for subsistence on their nu merous flocks of horned cattle, sheep, goats, and hogs, and on the occasional supplies of grain brought from the fertile dis tricts of Georgia.

VII.] OSSETIAN TERRITORY. 159 It has no towns; but there are numerous villages, each con- Field forts for taining from 50 to 500 families, who live in roughly-built defence ' stone houses, with flat roofs, which rest upon substantial beams. As these villages are not inclosed, and each has, in fact, only the protection of one or two square towers, the defence of that part of the Ossetian country, as well as of the other districts which are still independent (especially the Little Kabarda), is maintained by a number of separate, but simple and effective entrenchments. Each of these temporary fortresses consists of an inclosure formed by two rows of wattle work, placed four feet apart, and raised higher than a man's head; earth is tightly rammed between the rows, and the wall is loop-holed throughout. Over the inner circle thus formed, is placed a straw roof, beneath which the pea sants preserve their seed corn, as well as their agricultural and other indispensable implements. 1 This kind of defence is also general in European Turkey, where its first use, as a parapet surmounting the revetment of a rampart, is attributed to another brave, but less fortunate nation, the Poles. In recent times, it has been the received opinion of great mili tary authorities that the most difficult mountain countries may be turned, and that their defences, however formidable in themselves, must of necessity fall before a well-organized plan of attack: but the Caucasian highlanders have shown that this is not always the case ; for their determined bravery and patriotic endurance continue to triumph over the rules of tactics, though brought into operation by a succession of skilful leaders, at the head of a powerful and regular army of invaders, who are amply recruited from the Russian frontiers. 1 Klaproth's Travels, p. 360.( 160 ) CHAPTER VIII. afghanistan and baluchistan.

The three preceding chapters contain a description of the territories occupied by Turkey and Russia towards the western extremities of I'ran; and in the present will be given some account of the regions which border that country towards the east. These regions possess the highest interest for the British public, in consequence of our recent operations west ward of the Indus; and the following brief description of them has been drawn up chiefly from the well-known works of Elphinstone 1 and Pottinger. 2 The kingdom Afghanistan and Baluchistan became a separate kingdom under Ahmed Khan, who, at the close of the bloody contests which followed the death of Nadir Shah, was crowned at Kandahar, in October, 1747; but, at a later period, his suc cessor removed the seat of government to the present capital, Kabul. 3 The former territory nearly represents the ancient Ariani, 1 An Account of the Kingdom of Kdbul, and its Dependencies in Persia, Tartary, and India.

It has AfgMlli8tin - the elevated range of the Hindu Kush, with its continuation, the Paropamisus, to the north, the Indian Ocean on the south, Panj-ab and Sinde to the east, and the Persian pro vinces of Khorasan and Kirman on the west. The extreme length, from the northern slopes of the Paropamisus to the coast of Mekran, is about 640 miles, and its width, from the river Indus to the deserts of Khorasan and Siwistan, 550 miles. It therefore contains about 327,853 square miles, 1 and its superficies is consequently more than twice as great as that of France. 2 Within these limits are several extensive provinces, which its features, contain numerous lofty plains and elevated valleys, lying be tween and along mountain ranges, which, by intersecting the territory in almost every direction, cause a variety of soil and a diversity of climate. The great distinctive feature of this part of Asia, the stupendous Himalaya, appears to be the root of the Afghan mountains, which are more immediately de rived from one of its principal arms. The range of Bulut Tagh, or the Cloudy Mountains, forms The Buiut the natural division between Western Turkistan and the^ agh ' Eastern, or Chinese Turkistan; since it gives rise to the different great rivers which water both countries. The Jaxartes and Oxus descend from the western side; the Darija, the Chaidu, and other streams, flow from the opposite side; whilst the Hydaspes and Indus spring from its southern slopes a little lower down; and all take their departure before the range joins the elevated peaks of Hindu Kush, at a point which is nearly north of Kabul. From thence this range (the Paropamisus) has a westerly direction, and forms the north-western boundary of the Afghan territory, as far as the country beyond Herat. It occupies about two degrees of latitude, but with a diminished elevation, when compared with that of the still more stupendous Hindu Kush. 3 1 Nearly 36,428 square geographical leagues. 2 France contains 154,000 square miles.—Balbi, Abrege de Geographic, p. 594.

The most westerly of these (called Soleiman Tagh) com mences nearly south of the point where the Bulut Tagh joins the Hindu Kush, and runs in a southerly direction from thence as far as 29° north latitude, or the confines of Kach'h Gandavah, in three parallel ridges towards the Indus; and from this river, which forms the eastern limit of Kabul, the third and lowest of these ridges is not very distant. The northern portion of the space thus traversed is intersected by the range of the Salt Mountains, and by two others, which cross it from west to east, and between these are plains sloping towards the Indus. 1 The Khwajeh Another branch, forming an acute angle with the Soleiman range, appears to leave the Hindu Kush at the same point, and continues to some distance below Ghazne'in (Ghizni), under the name of the Khwajeh Amran mountains. Having reached 31° 31' north latitude, one branch diverges from the principal chain, and runs in a south-west direction, till it is broken by the valleys of Pi shin and Lorah, near the borders of the adjoining territory. Mountains of The mountains of Baluchistan are derived from two arms Baluchistan. 0 f ^ g rea ^ 0 f the Caucasus, which enter the territory towards the eastern limits, and from a third arm, coming in at its western extremity. From each of these a number of inferior ramifications take their departure, and intersect the country in almost every direction, the western branch passing in a southerly direction, not far from Herat. This branch afterwards forms the line of separation between Kirman and Siwistan; and is so elevated on entering Baluchistan, that the towering summits of the Surhud, or Cold Mountains, are visible at the distance of eighty or ninety miles. 2 After literally covering the district of Kohak with masses of moun tains, a number of branches are sent out in different directions 1 Elphinstone's Kdbul, p. 102. 2 Pottinger's Travels in Bdluchistan, p. 312. rCHAP. VIII.] RIVERS OF AFGHANISTAN. 163 to the southward and westward; and from these again there are other offsets, one of which, passing by Gaih and Kedge, traverses the whole of Mekran to its eastern extremity, in a direction nearly parallel to the sea. The eastern branch, or the Brahuik mountains, 1 which The Bmhuik likewise form an arm of the Hindu Kush, enters Balu- mounta,ns ' chistan above the Bolan pass, and there sends out many collateral piles to the N. N. W. and W. N. W.: some of these proceed westward, through the whole length of Balu chistan and the mountains of Persia, whilst others stretch southerly till they approach, or touch the sea. 2 The third, or central range, which, geographically, may be Sarawan! range, considered as a continuation of the westerly branch of the Khwajeh Amran, takes the name of the Sarawani mountains, and runs nearly S.S.W. from the valley of Shal, as far as 28° north latitude. Here it divides, and sends one fork to the S.E., to join the Brahuik mountains near the sea ; whilst the other, called Wushutu mountains, runs W.S.W. towards the opposite side of Baluchistan. From each of these, as well as from the preceding ranges, numerous offsets intersect ancient Gedrosia in every direction, imparting to it that desert-like and desolate appearance for which it is so re markable. With the exception of the navigable Indus and the Hari- Character of rud, 3 the largest streams in Afghanistan partake of the cha- e rivei ' racter of torrents, which are fordable throughout most of the year, and are, moreover, diminished in their onward course by the supplies drawn from them for cultivation in passing through the valleys which they fertilize. 4 The ancient kingdom, now the district of Herat, and Extent of formerly eastern Khorasan, extends from the borders of Siwistan, in 32° 30', to those of Turcomania, in 36° north latitude ; and eastward from Western Khorasan, in 65° 5', to 1 Pottinger's Travels, p. 251. 2 Ibid., p. 252. 3 The Orchus, which rises at Oha, on the Paropamisan mountains.—Elphin- stone 's Kabul, p. 117. 4 Ibid., p. 108.

The former district con tains a pastoral population, who possess immense flocks of sheep, and a proportion of small active horses, which are reared for sale. In the latter district there is a greater num ber of fixed inhabitants than in the former, and these are a line hardy race, who live chiefly in the valley of Farr-ar-rud, which terminates at the borders of Siwistan. Siyah-band is without any town of importance; but its chief places are Bihboud Khan, Ghoura Khan, and Kouroum Khan, in which the three principal Eimakh chiefs reside.

This town is considered to be the capital of the Nur-zayi country, and it is described as being a large walled town, situated in a fertile valley, midway on the high road from Kandahar to Herat. 8 Around the different villages throughout the rest of the distance, this extensive valley appears to be well culti vated, and enjoys a fine climate; as is the case likewise in the adjoining valley of the Kash-rud. The river Kash rises close to the head of the Farr-ar-rud, and takes a southerly direc tion from thence till it enters the Etelmand. The two dis tricts of Bamiyan and Ghoraut, or the Huzarah country, form the eastern, and, owing to its position towards the foot of the Hindu Kush, the least productive part of the territory of Herat. Dek Zangee is the chief town ; but the people live almost entirely in villages, which, like those of the Arme nians, are partly excavated in the sides of the hills, and have the protection of a strong loop-holed tower. In case of an alarm being sounded, this work is speedily occupied by a number of warlike people, sufficient for that sort of defence which proved so troublesome to the Macedonian conqueror 1 Captain Christie, in Pottinger's Travels, p. 411. 4 Ibid.CHAP.

In an isolated mountain at the eastern extremity near Bamiyan, there are some very remarkable ancient excavations, suffi ciently numerous to accommodate with apartments the inha bitants of a considerable city. There are likewise other interesting specimens of antiquity in the same neighbourhood, amongst which may be particularly noticed two colossal statues, cut in the side of the mountain, and supposed to have been connected with the worship of Buddh. 2 At the north-western extremity of the country is the dis- The valley trict which gives its name to the whole territory. This is the valley of Herat, which extends for a distance of 30 miles in length by 15 in width: it is surrounded by mountains, and watered by the river Tejund, which runs westward, or nearly parallel to the Paropamisus. The city stands about the centre of this highly-cultivated valley, and is encircled by villages having around them fields and gardens, the fertility of which cannot be exceeded. 3 Being the grand centre and emporium between India and andcityof Persia, Herat, owing to its transit commerce, has, by way of distinction, been called the Port. 4 The staple products of the province are silks, saffron, and assafoetida. Although fruits and grain are but partially cultivated, yet they are so x abundant about Herat, that the Persian camp was well sup plied during a siege which continued from the 22d of Nov., 1837, till the 9th of Sept., 1838 ; and it is said that bread was at that time as cheap there as in the market of Tabriz. The district of Herat represents ancient Aria, with a part Aria, of the country of the Paropamisadse; the former, which was also called Ery,-or Hery, the Sorner of Mercator, 5 being eastward of Parthia. It had the Paropamisadse on the east, 1 Quidquid malorum tolerari potest pertulit, inopiam, frigus, lassitudinem, desperationem.—Quintus Curtius, lib.

If this opinion be correct, the river of Herat will be the same as the Arius, which passes near the city founded during the advance of the conqueror, 4 and which is known to be lost in the soil of Turkistan, as described by Arrian. 5 Helmand river. To the south-east of the territory of Herat is the valley of the H^lmand, and in the same direction onward is the exten sive province of Kandahar. From its source in 34° 40' N. latitude, and 49° E. longitude (a little way west of Kabul), the Helmand flows S.W., and in 32° N. latitude it receives, on the eastern side, a stream formed by the united waters of the Urghand-ab, the Turnuk, and the Urghesaun rivers, which descend from the mountain-chains lying to the N.E., and water the principal portion of the province. The site of Kandahar is supposed to represent the Greek Alexandropolis. 6 Kandahar T1:ie P reseilt town was the capital till Timour Shah re moved the seat of government to Kabul. At this time it was distinguished by the appellation of Ahmed Shah', or Ashriful Bolaud (the noblest of cities), but the older name of Kanda har still prevails among the people. 7 It stands upon an elevated plain, in a fertile and cultivated country ; it is watered by a canal from the Urghand-ab river, and is defended by a substantial, loop-holed mud wall, with towers, and a narrow ditch. There are six gates, one of 1 Ogilby's Asia, p. 39; and Ptol., lib. VI., c. xvii. 2 Book VI., p. 237. Venice, 1562. 3 Ptol, lib. VI., c. xviii. ^ p linyj lib y L) c xxiii 5 Lib.

Kandahar is a parallelogram, lying north and south; it has a circumference of 4 miles, and con tains about 13,000 brick houses, and nearly 60,000 inhabitants. In addition to several line mosques and karvanserais, there is an arched rotunda, called Chahar-su, which contains shops ; and serves likewise for a place of public resort. This remark able building occupies the centre of the town, and from it the four great divisions of the bazaars diverge; three of these lead to different gates, and the fourth to the king's palace. 1 The direction of the valley of the Helmand continues to valleys joining the south-west, after the river of that name has received the Turnuk, and the streams already mentioned; and, farther on, there are other valleys, which approach it from the southern, or come into it from the northern side. The principal of the former are those of Pishin, which lie along the left bank of the Lorah river, and Shorawuk, which last forms a continua tion of the rich province of Shal, and extends to a point at some distance short of the Helmand, where the river Lorah is lost. A little westward of the termination of the Lorah the river Kash enters the Helmand from the north. Some of the valleys along the tributaries of the last river are rich and flourishing, and resemble those which penetrate the Khwajeh' Amran range from the west. The hills through out these tracts are occupied by a numerous race of shepherds, -and inclose many villages, besides plains of moderate size, some of which are well cultivated; the rest are appropriated to pastoral camps. 8 The country near the banks of the Helmand is also well character of cultivated and fruitful, and has a fine rich soil, which is y irrigated by the river; but the utmost breadth of this fertile land does not exceed two miles. 3 The great valley of the H61mand, therefore, presents that remarkable contrast which, in the east, is the result of the presence or absence of water; for a single step carries the traveller from the uninhabited 1 MS. notes of Mr. Masson's First Journey into Afghdnistdn. 3 Elphinstone's Kabul, p. 452. 3 Captain Christie, in Pottinger's Travels, p. 407-168 DRANGIANA AND ARACHOSIA.

The numerous ruins which this province con tains 1 sufficiently testify, that the country of Rustam must have been once fertile and full of cities, which equalled any in Asia in extent and magnificence ; 2 but the want of irrigation has entirely changed its face, and the inhabited parts are now chiefly confined to the valleys of Kash-rud, Farr-ar-rud, and the Helmand. Lake of The two last terminate with the sea of Durra, or Zarrah, a body of brackish water of about 160 miles in circumference. 3 The fort of Rustam (Copee Zur) is on a hill in the centre of the lake, 4 the shores of which are overgrown to a consider able distance with rushes and reeds, interspersed with pools of standing water; and these marshes, or thickets, are occu pied by herds of oxen belonging to a race of people different from the other inhabitants of Seistan, being tall, stout, black men, who live in reed hovels, tend their flocks, and fish or fowl on rafts among the rushes of the lake. 5 The two portions of territory just sketched represent the Drangiana and Arachosia of the ancients; one of them is of limited extent, and is situated near the termination of the Helmand, whilst the other constitutes a large tract spreading from thence to the eastward.

The city of that name stands upon an eminence 7726 feet above the sea, 7 and is completely com manded by its citadel, which is towards the north, but within the inclosure, and on a still higher portion of the same range. The city contains about 1500 houses, usually two stories high, and four inferior bazaars, which are covered with mats and wood. Both the town and citadel are sur rounded by ditches and irregularly built walls, flanked by semicircular towers. 8 On the low hills eastward of the town are the remains of a city, which, only eight centuries since, was the capital of an empire reaching from the Tigris to the Ganges, and from the Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf.

Its rivers. The river Logurk runs northward from this fortress to the capital, near which it joins the Kabul river, which comes by an eastern course from the mountains some miles westward. The united waters of the Ghaznei'n and Kabul streams now run along the valley of the latter, in which it receives the Kama, the Lundye, and numerous tributaries from the slopes of the Kohistan mountains ; and being constantly augmented, it eventually carries a great body of water along the plain of Peshawur into the Indus above Attok; but owing to the rocks, and the violence of the current, it is only navigable for rafts below Jellalabad. 3 Peshawur cily The extensive city of Peshawur contains about 100,000 Muhammedan and Hindu inhabitants, who enjoy a healthy situation, although the heat is more intense than that of any other place in this part of Asia. The houses, although of unburnt brick, are substantial, and usually three stories high. 4 This important commercial mart was one of the places founded by Acbar the Great for the benefit of his subjects; and its well-chosen site is surrounded by fine orchards and productive fields near the centre of an exceedingly rich circular plain, of about 30 miles in diameter, and district. This tract, which constitutes the whole of the territory, touches the river Indus on the east, and is elsewhere sur rounded by mountains. Its western limits are formed by the range of Sufeid Koh, through which there are four 5 passes in,the direction of Kabul; the principal being that of the Khybur, by which Nadir Shah advanced towards India, and 1 Belonging to the mosque called the CelestiaV Bride. 2 Elphinstone's Kdbul, p. 432. 3 Ibid., p. 114.

The most difficult part is formed by the defiles of Ali Masjid, near the Choora stream, choora stream, where bare and almost inaccessible mountains of 1300 feet high inclose this part of the pass, which, for the distance of one mile, separates the two clans of Khohi Khail and Zaka Khail. The western extremity of this difficult defile opens into the Khybur valley, which is inclosed on each side by hills rising to the height of about 700 feet, and it has an average width of 1500 paces through a distance of 16 miles, when it terminates in another narrow defile 1 leading to the village of Dhaka, in the valley of Kabul. The present capital is situated between, and partly on the acclivities of two ranges of hills, which shelter its northern and southern sides. This celebrated city occupies less space than Kandahar, having barely a circum ference of three miles. The bankers' and other bazaars are extensive, and display ample supplies of different kinds of merchandise. Southward of the town is an irregular citadel, stretching its walls, towers, and houses up the hill; so that these last may be seen from without, rising in succession to the highest building, which is a house, or rather a defensible tower, constructed by Sultan Muhammed Khan. 8 Kabul is compact, of moderate size, and constructed chiefly Kabul city of wood, on account of the earthquakes which are occasionally felt there. The city is washed by a stream which bears its name, and is placed amidst numerous gardens and groves of productive fruit trees, at the junction of two fertile valleys, de scending from the south and west. The tomb of the Emperor Baber is on a most agreeable spot at the top of a hill over hanging the river S.W. of the city. It is surrounded with beds of anemones and other flowers, and commands a noble prospect. 3 Eastward of the city are numerous valleys descending from and country, the north, in which are raised an abundance of the finest European fruits. The whole country enjoys the advantage of a delightful climate, and abounds with enchanting scenery; 1 Huft-chah, between Lundu-Khana and Dakka.—Elphinstone's Kdbul, p. 315. • • TT ^ 2 MS. of Mr. Masson's First Journey into AfgMnistdn; and Major Hough s Narrative, p. 283. 8 Elphinstone's Kibul, p. 434. z 2172 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY.

This district, and nearly the whole of that of Bamiyan, were included in the Paropamisus of the ancients, which, in its restricted limits, had Aria to the west, Arachosia to the south, the river Indus and the territory of Cathay (the an cient seat of the Seres) to the east; and, finally, the extremity of the Caucasian range, with the Sacse, on the north. The hills are high and barren, 2 and the valleys indifferently fruit ful, being overshadowed by the mountains, 3 which were so difficult of access, that in the time of Alexander, this country was scarcely known even to those who lived on its borders; and the inhabitants were in consequence rude and savage. 4 Ancient This tract was peopled by the Bolitse, or Cabolitae, and Aris- mhabitants. topholi, on the west; 5 likewise the Ambustse, Parretse, and Parsii, all of whom were known by the general name Paro- pamisadse, from that of the adjoining portion of the moun tains. Including the Huzarah country to the east, and that of the Eimaks to the west, Paropamisus extended 350 miles, with a breadth from north to south of about 200 miles ; and contained the city of Alexandria ad Caucasum, which we are told 6 was built by Alexander previously to traversing the Caucasus. This very remarkable place would seem to be represented by the Beghram of the present day. 7 Near it was the city of Nikaea, 8 which was passed on the return of the conqueror from Bactria. 9 In its vicinity was also the Kapissa of Ptolemy, now Perwan Durrah; 10 and finally the metropolitan city Karura, or Kabura of Ptolemy, the Ortos- pana of Strabo, whose situation and distances from some of the principal places agree with those of the present capital : n ' Elphinstone's Kibul, p. 55. 8 K^bul in Syriac signifies unfruitful.—Ogilby's Asia, p. 197. 3 Quintus Curtius, book VII.. c. iv.

Its principal city was Antiochia, 3 which was at first called Alexandria, and afterwards Seleucia, and which covered Seieuda. a space of upwards of eight miles in circumference. 4 This place is supposed to be represented by the Mero of Ibn Haukal, and the Merw-el-Rud of Edrisi,—an ancient and extensive city, constructed in a sandy but fertile district, at a bow-shot dis tance from the river Mourghab. 5 Margiana forms the southern portion of Zagaty, or the Usbeck country, and it is also part of the much-vaunted Mawer-al-Nacher of Ibn Haukal. 6 The leading features of Afghanistan are an assemblage of Features of mountain chains and high rugged hills, in some places sepa- Af s hamstai1 - rated by plains, but more generally divided by lengthened winding valleys, which, for the most part, are only to be approached through rocky defiles, such as the formidable passes of Bolan and Khybur. The country is partially clothed with wood, and enriched with cultivation; but it is almost destitute of roads, and has but few towns.

There is, however, a greater difference between the extremes of temperature in summer and winter, as well as between those of day and night, than in either of those countries ; but the climate is favourable to the human constitution, and many parts of the country are remarkable for their salubrity. 1 producUons. In . a re S] on where the productions of Europe are seen to flourish amidst a profusion of those of the torrid zone, the vegetable kingdom is particularly rich ; although the country at large is better suited for pasturage than for agriculture. In addition to the ordinary European trees, the hills are frequently clothed with a sOrt of gigantic cypress, and some trees not yet described, such as the suachob, purra, bulkhuk, and zurung. Many bushes which bear eatable berries are found, such as the barberry, kurounda, 2 the umlook, and the goorgoseh. The arghawaun, or gigantic anemone, the rose, jessamine, poppy, narcissus, hyacinth, and tuberose, grow in the gardens, and sometimes in a wild state. 3 SeMghint No p ? 0ple are more dili g ent husbandmen than the Afghans, and their efforts are not confined to the manual labours of the field, nor the ingenious excavation of a kanat; for, in addition to the portable hand-mill of the tent population, much me chanical ingenuity is displayed in the construction of water- mills, Persian wheels, and, especially, horizontal windmills. 4 The Afghans are remarkable for as many opposite qualities as the country which they inhabit, and for a peculiar mixture of good and evil in their characters. Without having lost the ruggedness of barbarous nations, they are guilty of the vices common to all Asiatics; whilst their simple manners are equally removed from the suppleness of a citizen, and the awkward rusticity of a clown : 5 yet, although far behind Europeans in veracity, one may generally depend on their honesty and fidelity. 6 1 Elphinstone's Kdbul, p. 140. 1 Elphinstone's Kdbul, p, 146. 5 Ibid., p. 149. 2 Cacissa Carounda. 4 Ibid., pp. 250, 305, 307. 6 Ibid., pp. 249 and 250.CHAP. VIII.] CUSTOMS OF THE AFGHANS. 175 The Afghans are proud and vindictive; yet, notwithstand ing much avarice and cupidity, and, as the natural consequence of those vices, a disposition to plunder (whenever it can be indulged beyond their immediate precincts), they are of an open, lofty deportment, and possess a martial, enterprising spirit abroad, with a sober, industrious, hospitable disposition at home. Within the precincts of their khails, custom has made it an imperative duty, founded on a point of honour, not only to be kind to a stranger, but likewise to answer in the affirmative the appeal even of an enemy for protection. The request being once granted, according to the Pushtan- walle, or usage of the Afghans, the life of the bitterest foe is secure whilst he remains in the territory. The Pushtanah (as the Afghans call themselves) are com- Their origin, posed of a multitude of different tribes, having one common origin; but, according to tradition, they are descended from Afghan, the son of Irmia, or Berkia, son of Saul, king of Israel; and all their histories begin by an account of the Jews from Abraham down to the captivity. 1 The government in each tribe is purely patriarchal; the Government of head of each family is responsible for the conduct of its mem- the tnbe8 ' bers; and ten of these, under a chief, called Speer, or elder (literally, whitebeard), form the first link in the scale. Again, ten or twelve elders and their followers are subject to a Cundeedacer, or head of the quarter, or division, who is the representative of their common ancestor; several Cundeedacers form a subdivision, which is subject to the chief of the whole (who is called Mullick, or Mooshir, sage) ; several of these sections compose a division, whose chief is selected from the oldest family in it. An uncertain number of such divisions compose a khai'l, 8 which, when separate, is called an Oolooss (nearly like a clan), and is under a khan, who is generally chosen by the king from the oldest family in the oolooss; and to this individual, assisted by a council (called a Jerga), which is composed of the heads of divisions, belongs the in ternal government of the country, under the control, however, 1 Elphinstone's Kdbul, pp. 152 to 155. a Arab., khyle, a band, or assemblage.176 SOCIAL STATE.

As the people are attached to the community rather than to their chiefs, the power of the latter is feeble; even that of the sovereign is much too limited to repress the anarchy and disorder which are the results of constant feuds between numerous tribes, or rather small republics, composed of men who possess that lofty spirit which has been so strenuously exerted against the present sovereign. Shah Shuja el Moolkh. Customs of the In some instances the Afghan customs resemble those of g ans the Jews. Wives are purchased by presents, or earned by services, as in the case of the patriarch; and the dominant tribe, the Durrani, refuse their daughters to the men of every other nation. The other principal tribes are the Barukzyes (that of Dost Muhammed), the Huzzarahs, the Populzye, and other Af ghans, the Ghiljies, the Eimauks, the Eusofzyes, the Shee- raunees, and Khyburees. 1 The power of divorce is freely exercised by the husband, and partially so by the woman, who is, however, required to give a substantial reason to the Kazi, or Kadi. 2 It is also thought incumbent on the younger brother to marry the widow of the elder, in which case the relatives of the latter receive the price paid. 3 Amongst the poor the women do the work of the house, and share the labour with the men out of doors; whilst those of the upper class are concealed, and enjoy all the comforts and luxuries belonging to such a situation. Moreover, they are taught to read, and many of them show considerable talents for literature. 4 amusements Afghans are very sociable, and have, both within and without the house, a great many amusements; in which, agreeably to the indulgent customs of the east, their slaves are allowed to share. Of the former, singing, dancing, play ing at backgammon, story-telling, and smoking, are the principal. 5 Among the latter are garden and country parties 1 Elphinstone's Kdbul, p. 309 and following. 2 Ibid., p. 180. 3 Ibid., p. 179. 4 Ibid 5 Ibid., p. 183.CHAP. VIII.] REVENUE, MILITARY SERVICE. 177 (chiefly on Fridays), hawking, cock and quail fighting, wrest- ling, drawing of the bow, combats with clubs, and other athletic exercises ; besides various kinds of hunting, in which the hyena is successfully employed, after being boldly and adroitly secured. The revenue is derived from customs and other duties, and Revenue, from commutations paid by particular districts, instead of sending troops. Provisions are supplied to the royal house hold, and to the troops when in motion; but the principal source of revenue is the land, which is assessed by fixed pro portions on the produce. The total amount of the king's income is estimated at about three millions sterling, scarcely two-thirds of which are paid. 1 The principal expenditure is for the maintenance of the royal harem and household, the officers of state, the Mullas, and the army. The Gholams, Kuzzilbaches, and Shahenchees, or camel Military force, artillery, make up a permanent force of about 13,000 men, in addition to 12,000 which are furnished by the Durrani tribes in return for their lands. Some of the other contin gents, chiefly of infantry, are furnished, in time of war, by the owners of lands elsewhere. A kind of militia, and a force called Dowstullub, are raised for the campaign, at a fixed price of 10Z. per man; and, finally, a general rising, called Ooloosse, is resorted to in case of invasion. 2 These feeble and uncertain means of defence have been superseded by a regular force, organized and commanded by and its British officers, which, in time, may produce the necessary orgamzatU)n stability, should his present majesty take advantage of his favourable position to form a wise system of government; and, if such were suited to the ancient institutions and prejudices of his warlike and unmanageable subjects, the latter might at length be induced to submit to regulations which would promote the welfare of the country. The preceding description relates more particularly to Afghanistan Proper, and we now proceed to notice the southern portion of the kingdom of Kabul, or the different provinces forming the adjoining confederation. 1 Elphinstone's Kabul, p. 251. 2 Ibid., p. 530 and following.

BALUCHISTAN comprehends a vast tract of mountainous country, but little cultivated, and very thinly peopled, which extends from 58° 55' to 67° 30' E. longitude, and from 24° 50' to 30° 40' N. latitude. 1 The Indian Ocean is on the south, Kirman on the west, Sinde and part of Shikapur on the east, with Seistan and the Afghan country on the north. 2 The territory of the Baluches may be considered as divided into four portions, which are unequal in size, and vary in soil and climate. M ekran and Lus constitute the immediate dependencies of Kelat to the north; four independent districts on the east constitute the second; the third is Kohistan, lying on the north-west; and the fourth is the adjoining desert towards Seistan. Beginning with the coast line, M ekran extends eastward for 500 miles, from the mountains of Moghostan, or Bash- kend, to the river Aghor; and its greatest breadth is about 220 miles. 3 Although less mountainous than the northern divisions, there are many ranges running through and across it, which fortunately assist, by the streams from them, in fer tilizing a soil otherwise remarkably sterile. 4 In general, it is badly supplied with water, which is often of an inferior quality; and it is only towards the coast that the soil is more amply provided with streams. These chiefly descend from the southern side of the great mountain chain, which runs nearly parallel to the coast, at a distance varying between 30 and 100 miles; but, with the exception of the Dasti Nudee (river), or Mooleedanee, the Aghor Nudee, the Muckloo Nudee, and some others, 5 they cease almost imme diately after the rains which cause them, leaving extensive rocky beds almost dry. 6 Comparatively little of Mekran is cultivated, but the abundance of camels and horses shows, that supplies of forage for the latter, and sustenance for the former animal, exist in almost every direction.

The towns also consist of houses which are formed chiefly of the latter material, and even the capital, Kej (though compared to Aleppo by Sherif TownofKej. Eddin), 3 partakes of this character. It is said to contain 2000 dwellings, built round a mountain, the summit of which is occupied by a fortress, or castle. This appears to be the ancient Chodda, which was visited by Alexander on his return from India. 4 Eastward (and constituting part of Mekran) is Lus, or Lus, Lussa, a very small district, with only about 80 miles of coast, and inclosed by two ranges of mountains running inwards, in a triangular shape, from the extremities, for a distance of about 60 miles from the commercial port of Sonmeany. The intervening space (as the name itself, Lus, signifies) is perfectly flat; 5 and it is only accessible by five passes through the surrounding mountains; one of these M passes leads northward into J'halawan, two into Mekran, and the others into Sinde. 6 There are two rivers, the Purali (anciently Arbis 7 ), which Rivers and passes by Bela, and the Hub, more eastward. Abundant owns ' crops of grain and sugar are cultivated on the banks of these rivers and the lesser streams which fall into them, but the rest of the country is for the most part barren.

From this province are exported considerable quantities of grain, with a few felts, some coarse carpets, dates and almonds; coffee and slaves being received in return, sirawan The second or eastern portion of territory contains four district. districts, viz., Sarawan, J'halawan, Kach'h Gandavah, and Harand, all of which were, till recently, subject to Kelat. Sarawan is the most northerly district of Baluchistan, and partly encircles the province of Lus. It has Kach'h Gan davah, or rather the Hala mountains, on the east, the desert on the west, and to the north the Afghan hills. 3 Like Lus, it contains several chains of mountains, interspersed with much waste land, and some which is cultivated. It is peopled by the pastoral Barahui, or Brahooes, who are essentially wan derers, not having towns or permanent villages. The Barahui Tumans, therefore, are constantly moving from mountain to mountain in search of pasturage, as there is not, throughout the whole country, a level spot, except the desert tract of Dashti be Daulat, the circumference of which does not exceed a few miles. 4 Mountain There are, however, at the north-eastern extremity of the passes. province five different places where, although with difficulty, this mountainous country may be traversed in a northerly direction from the side of Kach'h (Cutch); the most remark able of these being the celebrated pass of Bolan, which is encountered by the caravans nearly midway between Bukkur and Kandahar. For a distance of about twenty-five miles from Bebee-Nanee, 5 this defile is comparatively open, although 1 Pottinger's Travels, p. 298. s Ibid., p. 300. 3 Ibid., pp. 261, 262. 4 Ibid., p. 262. s Grandmother.—Major Hough's Nar. of the Army of the Indus, &amp;c M p. 51.chap. viii.] kelat. 181 it is closed on each side, and commanded by mountains. But at Ser-e-Khujoor the difficulties commence, and, for a dis tance onward of ten miles, a road of loose pebbles or sand con tinues to wind along the bed of the Bolan river, between high The Boian and precipitous rocks, which at intervals leave between them paS8 ' only sufficient breadth for a dozen horsemen. 1 But during the passage of our troops, it was ascertained that the rocky fissures and ravines falling from each side into this formidable pass are occupied by the villages of the Baluches, who ascend and occupy the apparently inaccessible ground on each side, in order to command and levy contributions on passing caravans. The province of J'halawan lies immediately southward of District of Sarawan: it has on the east Kach'h Gandavah, and on the west Mekran. The climate and soil of J'halawan are superior to those of Sarawan; yet it is understood that the population of the latter province, exclusive of Kelat, is nearly double that of the former. Kelat belongs, geographically, to J'halawan, though it has been for generations the acknowledged capital of both; and as the seat of the only regular government, it enjoys a certain degree of authority over the whole of Balu chistan. The communication between the winter station of the city of Kelat. principal Baluches on the sunny plains of Kach'h and the capital takes place through the Hala mountains at Gandavah, where the pass, between two marshes, is traversed in a west- by-northerly direction, by a road practicable for artillery, and abundantly supplied with water. The country from thence to Kelat is mountainous, and remarkable for a succession of precipitous ridges of rocks, forming difficult defiles. Kelat, or the City, occupies a part of one of the former, at the western side of a well-cultivated valley plain; and it contains about 2500 houses, constructed of sun-dried bricks, with about half as many more, which constitute the suburbs. The town itself is a parallelogram, having three of its sides defended by a bastioned loop-holed mud wall; whilst the fourth, or western side, as well as the summit of the hill, are occupied 1 Lieut. A. Conolly's Overland Journey, Vol. II., p. 186.182 fertility of kach'h. [chap. viii. by the citadel; a more respectable work of the same character, which incloses the extensive mass of mud-terraced buildings, denominated the palace of the khan. Although in J'halawan there is nothing deserving the name of a river, yet abundance of water can be found even for irrigation, by digging a few feet into the beds of those streams which cease to flow with the rains. The province is inter sected in all directions by mountains ; and, in addition to the district of Kelat, it contains those of Wudd, Khosdar, Nal, Punduran, Zuhree, Zedee, and two or three others of less consequence. There are several towns, and also many per manent villages, whose inhabitants, in addition to the Nomads of the plains, constitute a considerable population. Zahri, the chief town of J'halawan, contains two or three thousand houses, defended by an ordinary mud wall. 1 Kach'h Gandavah lies eastward of the Hala or Brahuic mountains; and it has Siwistan on the north, Sinde on the south, with a desert tract lying between it and the river Indus on the east. It is scarcely 120 miles long from north to south, and the width of the habitable and fertile part is but little more than 60 miles. 2 There are two streams in this province; the Nari, which comes from the mountains N.W. of Sebee, and runs through Mithu, Eree, Haji, and other places, until it is finally lost in the sand and jungle near Tambu; and the Bolan torrent, whose bed, as we have seen, forms, at one season, the ordi nary high road to Kandahar. Numerous aqueducts lead the water from these streams, to irrigate the rich loamy soil of the plains, which are capable of producing supplies for the whole of Baluchistan, and from whence, even in their pre sent state, great quantities of grain, cotton, and indigo, are exported. The villages covering the cultivated portions of Kachh are numerous, and it contains likewise several towns, such as Dadur Beg and Sheree, each having 1000 or 1500 houses. Gandavah, the capital, is walled, rather smaller than Kelat, and contains the winter palace of the khan, who, together with the principal sirdars, and a proportion of the 1 Pottinger's Travels, p. 261. 8 Ibid., p. 309.chap. viii.] desert of baluchistan. 183 people, remove thither during the winter, in order to avoid the extreme cold of the lofty regions of J'halawan and Sarawan. 1 The remaining territory lying eastward is the small district Districts of of Harand Dajel , which extends westward from the Indus ian to the districts of Tul and Chuteealy, or nearly to the borders of the preceding province, and northward to Derrahi Ghazi Khan. 2 The chief town is Harand, and the second Dajel. Although the district scarcely exceeds 50 miles in length or breadth, the soil is so fruitful, that the khan of Kelat receives a greater revenue from it than from the whole of the province of Sarawan. 3 Kohistan , or the land of mountains, is the third great ^ division: it extends in a triangular shape northward from Mekran, into the desert country, by which it is inclosed on three sides, the east, north, and west. 4 It extends about 180 miles from north to south, nearly as many from east to west at the base, or broadest part, and it contains two principal districts, Ma'idani (the Plain), and Kohak (the Hills). 5 In the former are permanent towns and villages, whilst the latter has only groups of felt tents here and there along the valleys.

Except Government, the ordinary patriarchal authority, the Baluches have not any particular form of government, or regular system of laws, beyond the capricious customs and prejudices handed down in each section; therefore, in this respect at least, the country 1 Pottinger's Travels, p. 310. 3 Ibid., p. 311. 5 Ibid., p; 313. s Ibid. 4 Ibid. 6 Ibid., p. 312.184 FRUITS AND TIMBER OF BALUCHISTAN.

Some little com mercial intercourse with other countries takes place on the coast of Mekran, whither the Baluches carry dates and other produce; receiving in return some few articles of foreign growth, and the remainder in silver rupees. 1 Desert between As the great desert stretching northward really belongs to Afghanistan Proper, it is only necessary to notice that por tion of it which forms a kind of inlet into Baluchistan, and thus separates Sarawan from Kohistan. The surface of this desert consists of high hillocks of sand, like the waves of the sea, extending 63 miles, 2 from west to east. Afterwards it is chiefly composed of black gravel, without the least trace of verdure for a distance of 80 miles onward, 3 to the borders of the pass leading into Kohistan, where the mountains and the cheerless prospect of the desert are all at once changed for the romantic and beautiful pass of Harand. The state of extreme desolation thus described does not, however, appear to prevail throughout the whole of the fourth division; for the sandy tract which separates the eastern from the western part of Baluchistan is partially inhabited, and yields a supply of forage, with a moderate proportion of grain and fruits, especially dates, for the wants of the inhabitants, and even for exportation. In addition to gold, silver, lead, copper, tin antimony, brimstone,, alum, saltpetre, 4 &amp;c., Baluchistdn pro^ duces madder, cotton, indigo, hemp, flax, oil, and horses ^ and is supplied with apricots, peaches, grapes of various kinds, almonds, pistachio-nuts, apples, pears, plums, currants, cher ries, quinces, figs, pomegranates, mulberries, plantains, and melons.

This Gedr08ia ' vast tract at one period included Guzerat, but in the time of Ptolemy it formed the continuation of the coast line from Carmania to the Indus, and extended northward from the Indian Ocean till it touched Drangiana at the western, and Arachosia at the eastern extremity 3 (both in about 30° 10' N. latitude), and the country of the Paropamisidse to the north. 4 The principal people were the Gedrosi and Gedrusi, 5 and inhabitants, its rivers the Arbis, 6 or Arke, 7 and the Nagari. The earlier capital was Panea, and the later Geste, or Gedrosar; 8 the other chief towns, Arabis, Cuni, Calamace, and Partonis, 9 Oscana, Easis, and Omisoe. Besides the Gedrosi, the country was inhabited by the Arabii, the Oritse, and Ichthyophagi; amongst whom Arrian divides the whole territory, which at one time had eight subdivisions, or satrapies, and twelve * towns. 10 As may be imagined, the climate and seasons vary exceed- climate of ingly in different parts of this extensive territory. In the Baluchl8tan ' loftiest regions of Baluchistan there prevails throughout a protracted winter, and part of a late spring, an extensive cold, accompanied by violent winds from the N.E. ; 11 whilst, on the other hand, the temperature of the maritime provinces and deserts approaches that of the tropics, with the ordinary variations caused by the hot, rainy, and cold seasons.

Manners of the Baluches and Sarawan are driven to the milder climate in the plains of Kacli'li Gandavah and Harand, whicli are again abandoned in turn for the former on the approach of summer. The population belongs almost exclusively to one or other of two great classes; the Baluches or the Barahui, and their numerous subdivisions. Generally speaking, they live a nomad life, 1 but may still be distinguished, notwithstanding this similarity, by their language and manners. The former people are supposed to be of Turkoman origin, 2 whilst the latter appear to be descended from a race of mountain Tartars. 3 They united into khails, or societies, in the seventeenth cen tury, when their chiefs became powerful at Kelat, and throughout Baluchistan. They are considered to be an ignorant people, following a primitive and predatory life. Their dwellings, or ghedans, are of two kinds; either tents made of black felt, or rude huts formed of tamarisk branches twisted together, and covered by a piece of coarse tent-cloth. 4 Many tribes, however, prefer huts made of earth, and roofed with twisted boughs of tamarisk. A certain number of these huts form a toman, or village; and the inmates a society, or khail. 5 The population of this extensive country is supposed to be limited to something approaching two millions, of whom the Baluches form much the larger proportion. Their clothing consists of a long shirt and trowsers of blue or white calico, with a quilted cap and turban round it, something like that of the Kurds; and in their general appearance they are between this nation and the Persians. The Baluches are patient, and particularly distinguished for that enduring courage so often exercised during the chupaos, or predatory excursions, which are the delight of this people. Petty thefts are held in the utmost contempt; and likewise any thing like a departure from that hospitality which is bestowed without distinction, or inquiry, upon all who claim it. The Barahui excel the Baluches in bodily strength and 1 Pottinger's Travels, p. 10. 3 Ibid., p. 271. 5 Ibid., p, 62. Ibid., p. 269. Ibid., p. 61.CHAP. VIII.] POPULATION. 187 courage, as well as in the expert use of the broadsword; and they are very skilful in shooting at a mark. They are, at the same time, more gentle, humane, and innocent in their manners, being altogether free from the worst traits of the Baluches, such as avarice, revenge, and cruelty. 1 The whole superficies of the territories belonging to the Superficies and former kingdom of Kabul is equal to 327,853 square geo- population - graphical miles, or nearly 36,428 square leagues, and the population approaches ten millions; of which about seven millions 2 belong to Afghanistan Proper, and the rest to Baluchistan: viz., 4,300,000 Afghans, 1,500,000 Persians, 1,200,000 Tartars, and nearly 3,000,000 Baluches and Barahui, 3 including their dependents towards the banks of the Indus. 1 Pottinger's Travels, p. 7. 2 Mr. Masson's estimate gives a much smaller number, 3 Elphinstone's Kabul, p. 84. 2 b 2( 188 ) CHAPTER IX.

Rise of the The first stream of importance towards the interior of the kingdom is the Kizil U'zen, whose affluents traverse and partially water five of the northern provinces. The principal branch rises in Ardelan, 1 and from thence it makes an exceedingly tortuous course of about 100 miles in length in the general direction of N.E. After this its line is more direct for about 50 miles, through part of the table-land of 'Irak, 2 and then it turns abruptly towards the N.N. W., and runs for 40 miles between high precipitous banks, through the district of Kizil Gechiler, near the extremity of which it receives a tributary on the eastern side, its course, The Kizil U'zen now breaks through a terrific chasm in the A'nguran mountains, 3 and afterwards runs northward about 10 miles, to the extremity of the strong defile called Derbend, 4 where it inclines a little eastward for eight miles, and passes the village of Kara-Butta. Proceeding in the same direction, at six miles beyond this place it receives the Zengan river, which arrives, by a north-west course of about 70 miles, from the plain of Sultaniyah: passing the town of that name, their united waters run nearly northward, along the deep valley eastward of Miana; in which, at about two miles to the north-eastward, it receives a considerable tribu tary bearing the name of that town. The latter tributary is formed by the junction of the Karagul and the Eye Dagemish rivers, which unite (the latter having previously and affluents, received two affluents) at a point two miles southward of the town, after draining four basins which extend towards the W.N.W. and S.W. parts of Azerbaijan.

Here the trunk formed by the western affluents receives Junction of the Shah-rud, or eastern branch, which comes from the bor- ^/western ders of Mazanderan, through the country of the Chief of the branches - Assassins, 1 after a course of nearly 90 miles in a direction opposite to that of the other branch, and after having drained the valleys along the western side of the Elburz. The meet ing of these arms gives a new direction to the Kizil U'zen, which nearly forms a right angle with each of its two branches, as it forces the passage of the Masula through the defile of Rudbar, and the narrow valley of Rustam-abad. Having traversed Gilan, the Sefid-rud (or White River, as it is called) finally enters the Caspian Sea, after a north easterly course of about 80 miles from Menjil, and nearly 490 miles from its springs. The bed of this river is gene rally many hundred feet below the surface of the adjoining country ; 2 but, near the pass of Rudbar, it becomes less deep; and, when passing through the plain of Gilan, the banks of the river are low and swampy, and the current is moderate. The navigation is, however, impeded by the existence of a Estuary of bar at the entrance, on which there is only a depth of water varying from three to seven feet. The other rivers have their sources in the central plateau of Persia, from whence they flow in an opposite direction to that of the Kizil U'zen, and pass through the Zagros and Bakhtiyari ranges, on the S.S.W., into the province whose comparative geography is now about to be considered. 1 Or Old Man of the Mountain.—Colonel Monteith : pp. 14 and 15, Vol. III.

K huzistan , in consequence of its connexion with Babylonia, and from being the most ancient province of Persia, deserves to be noticed in the first place. Its name is properly Khor- istan, or the country of Khors, so called on account of its numerous inlets from the sea, and its fresh-water lakes, to both of which the term is equally applied. 1 This ancient territory occupies the space between Fars, Luristan, the pashalic of Baghdad, and the Persian Gulf; stretching from the last, 2 for about 120 miles northward, to the mountains of Luristan; 3 and again, from the pashalik of Baghdad, 4 nearly 220 miles eastward, to the borders of Fars. 5 It has a triangular form, and consists principally of a rich alluvial plain, the superficies of which is 25,677 square miles. It is bounded by the Zagros chain, which, under the name of Luristan, terminates the province towards the north ; whilst the Bakhtiyari, or Cossseian range, forms the boundary to the north-east. The low coast to the eastward of the Bah-a-mishir is remarkable for a succession of deep inlets, which, like that river itself. Were at one time supposed to be so many different mouths of the Euphrates: the first is the Khor Seledge, and the second that of Busaf; both near the termination of the old Karun. Khor Musa, which is still deeper, follows; then that of Lus-bah, which is close to the Jerahi; and' finally, there is one near Sarema, on the banks of the Indian rather westward of the borders. The inland hors are those near the towns of Dorak and Mohammerah: one still more extensive is formed by the overflowing of the river Kerah at the town of Hawiza; and, lastly, the Samidah marshes above Kurnah, which appear to be part of the ancient Chaldean lake. In addition to these inlets and lakes, this fine province is abundantly watered by four considerable rivers, the Kerkhah, the Karun, Jerahi, and Indian; which, with their numerous tributaries, fertilize the country, by intersecting it in almost ^ In the latter case it is written H6r, a marsh or lake.

But as the affluents, like those of most other countries, are known by names different from those of the trunks to which they belong, it is desirable to give, from the examinations made in 1831 and 1836, as well as from other materials, a brief notice of the leading streams : in so doing, it will be convenient to commence on the western side, as this may assist in removing some of the misapprehensions respecting them into which both ancient and modern writers have fallen. One of the most important of these water-courses is the Three branches Kerkhah, or Kerah, which begins to flow in three branches, oftheKerkhah- all springing considerably eastward of Kirman-shah. The first, and most inconsiderable, has its commencement about 25 miles west of Hamadan. 1 The second has three springs on the side of Mount Elwand, or Orontes, six or eight miles south of that place. The latter runs south-westward till it meets the former in the plain of Maran, about 10 miles south-west of Kangawar; and, at a spot nearly 10 miles south of that place, it is joined by the third, or chief branch of the Kerkhah, which comes from the Guran mountains by a N.W. course of about 40 miles. The trunk of the three united streams, under the name of The Gamasab. the Gamasab river (of which the second above-mentioned may, from its northern and central position, be considered as the main branch), winds for nearly 30 miles in a general westerly direction to Bisutun, 2 chiefly along the Guran mountains. At this celebrated spot the Gamasab receives the Abi-Denawar, coming from the north; and again, after a course of about 12 miles nearly S.W., another stream, called the Kara su, passing through Kirman-shah at about 20 miles N.N.W. 3 of that place. The direction of the main trunk is nearly south, until it receives, at a few miles from 1 Major Rawliuson's March from Zohdb to Khuzistdn.—Vol. IX.

This is a very considerable stream, which rises close to the gates of Zagros, and has a tortuous course of nearly 100 miles in a general S.E. direction. In the latter part of its course, it forces its way through the Zagros, by a tremendous gorge, into the plain of Zangawan; being then at a distance of about 12 miles east of the ruins of Sirwan.' 2 From thence it takes the name of Abi-Sirwan, as it passes, m a S.S.E. direction, through the valley of Rudbar; being increased^ almost at the junction, by the Zangawan, the Abi-Sirwan, and two other streams; all of which come from the west. 3 SSi 0 ' ™ e 1 un i ted waters of Kara su and Abi-Sirwan, now called the Kerkhah, follow the Zagros in a S.S.E. direction lor about 30 miles, through the plains of Lort and Seimarrah, as fer as Pfih-Gamashan.

[CHAP. IX. From the relation thus given, it would appear that the stream in question gradually changed its course, first for a more southern, and latterly for its present easterly direction. Course of the The next considerable stream of Susiana is the Dizful, which flows in two branches north-east of Khorram-abad. The western branch has its source in the Kuki-chihil Na Balighan, a very few miles from that of the main branch of the Kerkhah. Its direction is south-east for about forty miles, within which space it passes Burugird and Bahrein ; and after receiving the eastern branch at the latter place, it enters the mountainous country, where it pursues a tortuous course of about 100 miles in the general direction of south. Having penetrated through the Zagros chain nearly at its most ele vated point, the water forces its way through a succession of chasms and gorges by the fort of Diz, and proceeds south- westward between the hill forts of Tangawan and Kal'ah Shahi, 1 throwing out several branches 2 at the commencement of the plain of Susiana, along which it continues in the same direction for ten miles to the western side of Dizful. This City of Dizful. city occupies some swelling ground a little way above the left bank of the river. It is inclosed by a dilapidated wall, flanked by semicircular towers, and contains upwards of 4000 houses, which, from their square form, their towers and Sara cenic arches, have the appearance of so many mud castles, overlooking the flour mills, the fine bridge of Shapur, and, beyond the right bank, the showy tomb of Muhammed Ali Mirza. After passing the town in the previous direction, and in a single stream, the river receives at the seventh mile The aw - fr0m tllence ' or at twelve from the Kerkhah, the Abi-Balad- Baiad-rM. ru ^ a mountain stream, which comes from the hills of Man- gerrah and Shah-zadah Ahmed, in the general direction of S.S.W., through the rich plain of Sahrai-Lur. The Abi- Balad-rud is a mere rivulet in the dry season; but when rains abundantly on the hills, the water comes down in a large torrent, and with such force, that the stream becomes alto gether impassable for the time, especially in the upper part of 1 Major Rawlinson's March, p. 67, Part I.

The bed of this occasional torrent is covered with a peculiar kind of pebble, which being filled with little fossil shells resembling grains of rice, is called Sangi-biring, or the rice stone. These stones are also found in the river at Shuster, but of an inferior quality ; and they are in much request throughout Persia for the head of the Nargil pipe, which is almost invariably composed of this material, set in silver. 1 After being joined by the Abi-Balad-rud, the Dizful river The Dizmi runs southward, or nearly parallel to the Kerkhah, for a few miles, when it suddenly changes its course to the south-east. It then makes its way, in the latter direction, into the western branch of the river Karun, a little above the junction of the latter with the eastern branch. This junction takes place immediately below Bandi-Kir, after a course of about 280 miles. The Karun itself is next met with in proceeding eastward Rise of the from the Dizful river. It rises, according to Kinneir (who is Karfin ' followed by Major Rawlinson), at Correng, in the Kohizerd, or Yellow Mountain, at about 40 miles south-west of Ispahan, 2 and runs west by north through a mountainous country. At rather more than 50 miles from its source, the Karun w r ashes the extensive and interesting ruins of another Susan; 3 and, about 13 miles lower in the same direction, it passes the Masjidi-Suleiman-Buzurg. 4 Again, at about 40 miles further, in the previous direction The Upper of west by north, and at nearly 20 miles from Shuster, it makes an abrupt bend towards the S.S. W., as it finally breaks through the Zagros range, and pursues its onward course towards that city; a little way short of which, and near the upper extremity of the well-known bund of Shapur, a tempo rary bifurcation takes place, so as to insulate the town.

The branch last mentioned, which is called the old Karun, after washing the eastern side of Shuster, becomes navigable for boats of con siderable size. 8 At the village of Hassemania, a few miles below the city, it takes a winding course of about 30 miles through low hills, in the general direction of S.S.W., and carries a considerable body of water along the eastern side of Bandi-Kir. After receiving the western branch, as already mentioned, below that place, 3 the main stream pursues nearly a direct course 3° 10' west for 10 miles, as far as the western side of the little town of Wais. Here the river makes a bold sweep for 9^ miles west 3° south; and it formerly received in this part of its course the river Shapiir, or rather one branch of it. The bed of this branch is still to be traced at a spot about a mile and a half below the town, and it appears to have come from the north-west. At this place, which is 2^ miles short of Karabuk, the Karun becomes exceedingly tortuous, and thus continues for a distance of 20 miles, in the general direction of south 33° west to Ahwaz. lid Kirfm ^ ^ tt ^ e wa y below the extensive ruins of this ancient town, Wriy con- are the remains of a channel, by which, within the memory of those still alive, the waters of the Shapur (probably those of the main branch) entered the principal river after they had ceased to do so near Wais.

The course of the Karun now becomes less tortuous ; and Course of the for 29 miles, to Ismaili, it runs in the general direction of ^e 'cut River, south 22° west, making a sweep more westward before it reaches the latter place. From hence the river again curves to the westward, previously to forming a great bend in the contrary direction. After this last bend, the windings be come more moderate, and so continue as far as the castle of Sabla, which is situated on the left bank, at 60^ miles by the river, south 5° west of Ismaili. From the ruins of the town of Sabla, just below the castle, its ancient con- the Karun made its way in former times directly to the sea, 'he sea WIth without having, as at present, a communication with the Shatt el Arab through the Hafar canal. Nearchus must, therefore, before he reached the estuary of the Euphrates, have met the river Karun ; and having a communication with the present river of that name, he had only to proceed along it into the Shapur, in order to meet Alexander at Sus. The ancient bed of the Karun was followed by the officers state of the of the Expedition for some distance towards the sea, on which auc,e11 occasion they found it to be about 200 yards broad, running in a south-easterly direction, or nearly parallel to the Bah-a- Mishir, and with every appearance of having contained a large body of water in former times. At present, however, there is merely, in the centre of the old bed, a small channel, which is filled during the flowing tide ; but on the ebb it is reduced to about one foot of brackish water, which is supplied chiefly from the Dorak canal. This last is an artificial cut, which The Dorak leaves the extremity of the old river at Sabla, one mile from the modern Karun, and goes from thence, north 83° east, 27^ miles, to the residence of the Sheikh of Ka'b at Dorak. At this place, which is also called Felahiyah, its waters are almost entirely supplied from the Jerahi, although it commu nicates with the Karun at one extremity, and is affected by the tide up the old Karun, as well as through the Hafar canal. From Sabla, the main trunk of the Karun pursues a course200 COURSE OF THE JERAHI. [CHAP.

This is a large navigable branch, run ning 31 miles from the Karun, in the general direction of south 25° east to the Persian Gulf, but making a gentle curve a little eastward of this line; which is, in fact, nearly parallel to that of the Shatt el Arab, as will be seen by the Maps. S'the JeSh! 1 r ^ e next r ^ ver to t ^ ie eastward is the Jerahi, which waters an extensive valley, abounding, at its upper extremity, with fine oak and walnut trees, rhododendron, and wild vines, besides pear, apple, and other fruit trees. The chief branch, known as the Rudkhouch Kerdistan, springs from the Koh Margoun, one of the Bakhtiyari range, at a spot about 14 fursucks to the north-east of Beibahoun. Its course is nearly 1 south-west, and it passes the ruins of Kerdistan, where it already has a breadth of about 350 feet. From thence, near the ruins of Rhajoun, it flows through the pass of Tenk-y-. tucaub, into the plain of Beibahoun, about seven miles north west of the place which bears that name. This is a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, containing a bazaar, two khans, and well-built houses, with numerous orchards and gardens. 2 From hence, with a deep and rapid course, 3 the river takes the direction of north 50° west, as far as Khaliph-abad, to the be h iow erahl soutl1 of Hormuz » where it receives a tributary coming from Beibahoun. that place. 4 This tributary 5 is formed by two principal branches, the more eastern of which rises in the great chain, a little way to the north-east of the fort of Mungasht; and at a few miles north-east of the agreeable little town of Roumiss (Ram Hormuz), situated amidst gardens and orange groves, 6 it is joined by the western branch called the Abi-Zard, 7 a consider- Stocquelar's Fifteen Months' Pilgrimage through the Untrodden Tracts of KMzistdn and Persia, in 1831 and 1832. 8 Ibid. ^ MS.

After the junction at Khaliph-abad, the Kerdistan river The Kerdktan flows a little more southward, 1 and then, under the name 0 f branch • the Jerahi, becomes not only navigable for country boats, but carries a large body of water in a S.S.W. direction towards Dorak. At six miles from this town, the river makes a deep short bend to the south; and a great diminution of its waters takes place, in consequence of six irrigating canals being cut from it, to fertilize the populous country stretching west ward. Part of the water thus diverted is carried into the town, where it unites with the canal already mentioned as coming from the Karun, near Sabla. This canal has been mistaken for a branch of the Jerahi by those who have ob served that boats occasionally pass along it from one river to the other. On these canals, as well as on the minor branches derived City of Dorak. from the Jerahi, there are numerous villages, 2 having commu nications one with another, as well as with the chief town, by means of curious suspension-bridges, or more properly dykes, the ropes and links of which are made entirely of reeds. Dorak, the capital of the district, is situated in a marshy plain, and contains about 6000 inhabitants, who live in houses built with sun-dried bricks, and having sloping roofs. It is defended by a fort and a mud wall, and is sur rounded by date plantations. Commerce is carried on by means of the canal with Mohammerah and Basrah, and the people sometimes call it Little Basrah. 3 A few miles below the town the now diminished Jerahi The JeraW enters some marshes, in which another portion is lost, whilst Persian Gulf, the remainder, under the name of Lusbah, makes its way, by a southerly course, to the Persian Gulf. The stream here, though very much reduced, is still navigable for boats. The last river to be noticed is the Tab, which, however, only in part belongs to Khuzistan, since it forms, in the 1 Major Rawlinson, Vol. IX.

IX. lower portion of its course, the line of separation between this province and that of Fars. The eastern and larger branch comes from Fars, and is formed by the junction of the Harharas with the Rudkhonick-Shir, and other afflu ents, at a spot about 20 miles W.N.W. of Shiraz. Its course is north-west as far as the considerable village of Fai- lioun, from whence, much diminished by irrigation, it runs nearly west to Zehitoun, and there it receives the Keir-abad river, or Tab 1 branch, which comes thither along the borders ol Fars, by a W.S.W. course, passing eight miles eastward of Be'ibahun. The river, now of considerable size, preserves a western course as far as Indian, a town of about 4000 inha bitants ; up to which, when ascended by Lieut. Whitelocke, of the Indian navy, in 1836, it was found to be navigable for boats of twenty tons. From hence the river inclines more southward, and has a tortuous course through an alluvial soil to the Persian Gulf: an extensive population have their dwelling on its banks. Although, like the rest of the province, belonging to Persia, the southern portion of Khuzistan (anciently Cissia), which extends westward almost from the Indian to the Kerkhah, may in some degree be considered as a separate government under the Sheikh of Ka'b (Chaab), who pays a moderate annual tribute, in lieu of all taxes, to the shah. This chief derives his income from the goods imported through Mohammerah, as well as from the extensive rice-grounds and tine date-plantations along the Shatt el Arab, Karun, and Jerahi. He also draws a revenue from the manufacturers of the thriving town of Dorak, which is his principal residence. The Beiglerbeggie of the province resides almost entirely in Dizful, though the capital is Shuster. The latter city con tains about 20,000 inhabitants, and probably between 5000 and 6000 houses, partly in ruins. These cover an elevated and insulated piece of ground, extending from the left bank of the western Karun to the right bank of the eastern branch. Within its dilapidated walls there is, on the western side, a castle overlooking the fine bridge constructed by Shapur, and The Masan of Abu-l-fedd.—Translation by Mr. Rassam.CHAP. IX.] CULTIVATION, PRODUCTS, ETC. 203 the ancient excavations at its western extremity. A little way northward of the city, at the bifurcation of the river, is the famous reservoir called. Shadarwan, with the bridge of Shapur, and several deep and fine khanats, which will be hereafter noticed. In addition to the care of cattle,' which is the prevailing Productions of occupation, agriculture is carefully attended to, and the quan- the country ' tity of tobacco, rice, and other grain (especially barley) pro duced along the banks of the rivers, is considerable. Some cotton is likewise grown; and in the district of Ahwaz, sugar was abundant at no very distant period. On the lower parts of the Karun and Kerkhah, as well as in the Chaab country, dates are sufficiently abundant to be an article of commerce. In addition to the bitumen and naphtha of Bandi-Kir, Dara- napth, &amp;c., tents, red cloth, coarse woollens, and some cottons, are manufactured; the last chiefly at Dizful, where dyeing is extensively practised. Large flocks of sheep, with a portion of goats, camels, horses, and mules, are to be seen on all the rich pasture-grounds of Susiana. Occasionally permanent walled villages are met with ; but Dwellings of the greatest part of the inhabitants live in tents, which are the people ' of a large size, being supported by a number of poles, in parallel rows, lessening in height from the ridge towards the sides, which are very low. This kind of tent is more commo dious than that which is in use in other parts of Persia, or in Arabia. In the latter country, more frequent changes of resi dence render one of a lighter and smaller construction necessary. Khuzistan represents the Susiana of Strabo, 1 as well as Cities of the Cissia of Herodotus. 2 Towards the eastern frontiers are the ruins of Rhajoun and Kerdistan in the centre, those of Agings (probably represented by Ahwaz) towards the west; Rudbar, Se'imarrah, Badaca, and I'wani-Kerkh on the Kerkhah; and finally, near the latter stream, are those of Sus, Susan or Shushan, 3 the ancient capital. Sus is the Persian as well as the Hebrew name for the lily, a flower which abounded near this winter residence of the Assyrian 1 Lib. XV., p. 727. 2 Lib. V., c. Hi. 8 ' I was at Shushan, in the palace.'—Daniel viii. 2. 2 D 2204 SUS. THE CHOASPES, [CHAP. IX. monarchs, 1 and was considered as the emblem of purity. Susana was a name originally applied by the ancient Jews The ancient to those daughters who were the most fair; and probably from them the name was received by us. 2 Susan signifies White Lily, and Susannah, My TV kite Lily ; the termina tion ah being a feminine possessive pronoun. The capital of this province was also called Memnonia, 3 from the sup posed founder, Memnon : its walls were compared by Strabo to those of Babylon, 4 to the ruins of which city those of Sus have a very striking resemblance, even at this day. Cissiana, the country of the Cosssei, is evidently part of the Chus 5 of the sacred Scriptures, the Ethiopia of Moses; and its name was derived 6 from Chuschi, an Ethiopian. That the geography of the province was well known before the time of Herodotus may be inferred from a passage in his works, where it is said, that Cissia is watered by the river Choaspes, on which is the city of Susa, and the palace of the great king. It is added, that its waters alone were thought worthy of being drunk by the monarch. 7 The river Choaspes and the country itself appear to have been minutely represented on a brass plate, which exhibited an outline of the whole earth. 8 SentifkTwSi r ^ e geographical position of the Kerkhah and the ruins theKerkhah; of Sus, near its banks, identify that river with the Choaspes of Herodotus, which some have supposed to be the same as the Eulseus; this opinion, however, seems to be in opposition to the distinct statements of Strabo 9 and Pliny. 10 We are told, that the son of Abutites met Alexander be tween Babylon and Susa, and having offered the submission of his father, he conducted the invader to the river Choaspes, where the latter was met by the satrap in person, with pre sents of regal magnificence. 1 Steph.

But as the trunk of this river, the presumed Eulseus, is formed by two great arms, the western branch would seem to represent the Copratas, which comes after the Choaspes, as well as the Pasitigris ; 6 and the eastern, the Hedypnus, which falls into the Eulseus coming past the Asylum of the Persians. 7 And, as the Jerahi is a separate stream, it may in this case be the Adunam, 8 and the Koru-Khan-Kendi of Timur's march to the eastward. L uristan extends westward for about 270 miles, from the borders of Fars 9 to those of Kirman-shah, 10 with an ordinary width of about 70 miles; and a superficies of nearly 19,500 square miles. Being along the Bakhtiyari range, it is chiefly mountainous, 11 although there are some plains toward the opposite side, which are well watered by the numerous affluents of the Karun, the Dizful, and the Kerkhah rivers.

The province is subdivided into the districts of Luri- Kuchuk and Luri-Buzurg: the former is westward of the Dizful river, and near the plains of Khawah and Alishtar, on the borders of Assyria. 8 The Wall (anciently the Atabeg) resides in Khorram- abad, which is the seat of his government: here a fort occupies the crest of an isolated rock, which rises in the centre of a precipitous pass ; and the town is on the south western face, near the commencement of the rich plain. This place probably represents the Diz Siyah, or Kuh Siyah, The Batten which originated the title Cosscean? The latter, or Luri- Buzurg, is generally known as the Bakhtiyari country; which, like the other portion, was subject to the Atabegs,' whose fastness, Mungasht, occupies a detached mass of scarped rock, which is deemed impregnable. 4 This part of the country contains two grand lire-temples; one near the ruins of Manjanik, 5 and the other, called Masjedi-Suleimani- Buzurg, on the river Karun 6 Ancient ruins. It contains also the ruins of several cities ; such as Man janik (near Mungasht), 7 Mai Amir, or Eidij, and Susan, on the Karun ; 8 and among the ruins is an abundance of arrow head inscriptions.

It lies between 27° 20' and 31° 42' N. latitude, and between 49° 20' and 54° 20' E. longitude, and has the shape of a quadrilateral figure, each side of which is nearly 220 miles long. It has Kirman and Laristan on the east, the Persian Gulf on the south, Khuzistan on the west, and 'Irak Ajemi on the north; with a superficies of about 44,335 geographical miles square, or nearly one-third of France. 3 At its south-eastern extremity a high chain of mountains, forming the continuation of the Jebel-abad range, runs W.

The plains of Sahara Laeshter and Dagumbeson are without cultivation; but those of Basht and Sahara Dawater, near Ardicoun, are very fertile: about Basht there is a profusion of box and myrtle, which give a delightful perfume. 3 The valleys near the town of Failioun produce orange-trees and abundance of rose-bushes; and in those near Deh Hassan-Ali-khan, are oaks, fine walnut and other fruit trees, especially large standard apricots. 4 Fars contains the salt lakes of Bakhtegan (also called Ninz) and Dereachte, which are in the neighbourhood of Shi raz ; there is also a fresh-water lake in the plain of Zerdan. The principal streams are the Band-emir, or Araxes, which receives the Kur Ab, or Cyrus, as it runs from west to east m the centre of the province, and eventually falls into lake Bakhtegan; and the Nabon, whose course is from Firoz-abad southward to the Persian Gulf: in this country are also the higher parts of the two branches of the Tab.

The modern places of some note are Darabgerd, Jarem, Abu Shehr. Fasa, and Firoz-abad, all towards the eastern frontier; while, on the western side, are Kazerun, Mayeen, Oujan, and several smaller places. Abu Shehr (Bushire), the second place and the principal seaport, stands upon a low, sandy point, running N.W. on one side of a bay, and the harbour, though defective, is the best on this coast; Con- goon, Bander Delem, and Cogoon, being only suited for boats. Towards the land side, which is low and marshy, Bushire is defended by a loop-hooled wall, flanked by twelve towers, and contains a population amounting to nearly 10,000 souls. The houses are of a very ordinary class, but a few badgeers, or wind-towers, occasionally relieve the sombre appearance of the place. At 34 miles W. N.W. of this port are the rocky islands islands. Karrak and Corgo, which are separated from each other by a narrow channel. The former is inhabited by a few pilots and fishermen, who are chiefly employed at Bushire, of which the island is a dependency ; and it is of some import ance on account of its good anchorage, and abundant supply of excellent water. Shiraz, the capital of the province, occupies the centre ofshinu. a mountain basin, with rich gardens and fields extending from the walls to the foot of the surrounding mountains. It is constructed 2 of unburnt brick, and is surrounded by a ditch and a wall, flanked by semicircular towers, which rise some feet above the parapet.

The latter are built in the form of a cross, and are well supplied with goods imported from India, Constantinople, and Russia, as well as from the west of Europe, The shops display good specimens of work in gold and silver; also copper utensils, rose-water, dried fruits, goats'-hair, spices, tobacco, fine linen, and the silk and cotton brocades, for which last this city was celebrated in the time of Ibn Haukal ; s and there is still a mint, in which karoons, and the other coins of the province, are struck off. andent Persist Tllis territory represents ancient Persis, which name was at one time applied to the whole kingdom. Persis extended eastward, from Khuzistan to the borders of the two Kar- manias, 3 and likewise northward, from the Persian Gulf to the Parachoatras range ; 4 while, towards the N.E., it bordered the Parthian territory. 5 The limits thus given extend the territory of Elam to the borders of Lar, 6 and it represents, at the same time, the Nimruz, or Kusdi Nimrodz, 7 of tradi tional history, which subsequently extended, eastward, to the Indus, and northward to Balkh. 8 Persis was watered by the Araxes, Gyndes, Oroatis, Arasis, Pelevar, and Bagrad. Its cities were Corna, Axima, Arbrea', and Artacana; besides many others whose sites are unknown. Persepolis was the capital in the time of Alexander; more anciently, the seat of the government was at Pasargada, 9 the Persagadis of Quintus Curtius; 10 but as this historian speaks of the fortress of Persepolis, and the city of Persagadis (qu. Farsa-Gerd ?), it is possible that the extensive ruins in the plain, near the former, may be the Pasargada of Pliny. 11 1 In the time of Ulug Beg there were 24,000 houses.—Ogi]by's Asia, p. 3.

This central district is surrounded by Fars, Kho- rasan, Mazanderan, Gilan, Azerbaijan, Ardelan, and Luristan. It extends from Fars, 1 northward 210 miles to the crest of the Elburz range; 2 and from the borders of Luristan, 3 eastward for 235 miles, to those of Khorasan, 4 with a surface exceeding that of Fars; or about 57,481 geographical miles square. The great plain of Khorasan and Kirman runs into the eastern and central parts of 'Irak, but the rest of this province is entitled to its local appellation, Belad el Jebel, being de cidedly mountainous; for, in addition to the numerous chains of naked rocks which intersect the territory in different direc- it. features, tions between the Elwand and Elburz ranges, the offsets from the districts of Hamadan, Luristan, &amp;c., form one extremity, 1 In 31° 25' N. latitude. 8 In 360 N - latltude - 8 The Elwand range, in 48° 20' E. longitude. 4 In 53° 20' E. longitude. 2 E 2212 DISTRICT OF HAMADAN.

Although inferior to Fars in fertility and cultivation, 'Irak contains fine plain/ 8 and valle y s an( i r i c h plains, with excellent pasturage, and con siderable tracts of cultivated land. Amongst the valleys may be noticed those of Hamadan, Khoonsar, Yezdikhast, and Roach (S.W. of Ispahan), Kizil U'zen, &amp;c.; and, among the plains, the great tract extending from Ispahan to Teheran, together with the productive regions of Komishah, Sultamyah, Kashan, Kasvin, and Ahman-abad. The last district is on the confines of Fars, and in it is situated, on the border line between the two provinces, the singular castellated town of Yezdikhast, occupying an isolated rock of about 600 yards long by 50 wide. The town commands the opening of a valley bearing the same name, which enters, like a deep fissure, into the plain itself, of Kama- Along the slopes of the Elwand, the ancient Orontes, is the elevated district of Hamadan, with which Kurdistan may be said to terminate. The capital is in a cultivated amphi theatre, shaded with elms, poplars, firs, &amp;c., at the foot of the picturesque Elwand. This mountain is covered with verdure almost to its snow-clad peak, and abounds with springs, in addition to the fine stream 1 which traverses the town. Arrow-headed inscriptions 2 mark the antiquity of a site generally considered to be that of Ecbatana, the capital of Media Magna. It boasts of the castle of Darius, the sepulchres of Esther and Mordecai, with the tomb of the philosopher and physician Avicenna. The spacious Maidan (now a market), and the' once splendid mosque of Jumah, be speak the grandeur of the city at a time anterior to its destruction by Timur. It contains about 10,000 houses, 3 and the palace of the governor, who has been usually a prince of the royal blood. Komishah, Towards the eastern side of 'Irak is the town of Komi shah, consisting of three separate villages, which, with their inclosures and garden grounds, cover a considerable space. The bazars are good, and, although much decayed, this place still contains about 3000 souls. 1 The Narwend.-—Morier, p. 264. 8 Ibid., p. 267. MS. Journal of Mr. A. A.

It contains a palace built by Abbas the Great, a iine college, and upwards of 30,000 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in the manufacture of copper utensils, or silk and cotton stuffs. Some miles northward is the town of Koom, which, though partly in ruins, contains about 12,000 inhabitants. It possesses also the tomb of Fatima ;* and, on that account, it is a favourite place of resort for the Shi'ah pilgrims. Kerbela is another town, which is much fre quented for devotional purposes by persons of the same sect. On the edge of the same plain, at some distance towards the N.W. of Koom, and occupying the lowest declivity of the Elburz, stands the large commercial and flourishing city of Kasbin, once the seat of the Soifeean dynasty, and now containing about 8000 houses. More eastward, on the southern slope of the same range, Description of is situated the present capital, Teheran. The city is on the e eran ' border of a cultivated plain, which contains many villages, but very few trees, and, except in the spring, no verdure. A mud wall, flanked by numerous towers, and a ditch, inclose the city; within which there is a citadel, containing the palace, the treasury, and the extensive but irregular building constituting the harem, with its gardens. The mosques, colleges, baths, and karvanserais, are, as usual, numerous; and the bazars are well provided with the ordinary supplies for an eastern people. The city contains about 170,000 souls ; which number is, however, reduced to something like 60,000, when the summer heat obliges the court and many of the inhabitants to encamp on the plain of Sultaniyah, and elsewhere. About 29 miles E.N.E. of Teheran is the pass of Imam- Supposed Cas- Zadeh-Hashem, which is supposed to be the principal Fan Gates • Caspian gates ; 2 and, about 90 miles eastward of the capital, is the plain of Dio Sefid, which leads to the pass into Mazan- deran and Aster-abad.

Ispahan, the former capital, occupies the central part of an oval plain, which is inclosed hy a range of mountains, pre senting a singularly serrated outline; the lowest part is on the N.E., and the highest on the S.W. side of the city. From an elevated pass leading through the rugged and rocky belt on the latter side, there is obtained a fine view of this mountain basin, whose circumference is about 30 miles. 1 It is well watered by the tortuous Zeud-rud, which flows through it rather southward of its centre. Description of Not far from the right bank are the extensive Armenian the city; suburbs, gardens, &amp;c., of Julfa; and, on the opposite side of the stream, abutting upon four noble bridges, is the city itself; which, although of a heavy brown colour, owing to the materials with which it is built, is still one of the most striking in the east. It has two citadels, and contains the splendid Chehel el Sittoon, with six other attractive palaces, having gardens laid out with canals, and walks shaded by stately chinars. Besides these, there are numerous khans, medresses, mosques, &amp;c., with public walks leading up to them : the great Mai'dan is 490 yards long by 166 broad. Numerous light arches and arabesque ornaments adorn the public rooms of the different houses, while the mosques, medresses, &amp;c., are surmounted by lofty minarehs. and gilded domes. The city is backed by rugged mountains, rising like a gigantic wall beyond the surrounding gardens, in which numerous pigeon towers are conspicuous; but on entering it the pleasing illusion produced by the view from the exterior vanishes, and ruinous houses, untenanted palaces and colleges, with half-occupied karvanserais, the consequences resulting from the removal of the v court, meet the eye in every quarter; its bazars. i n f ac t 3 the bazars alone show some signs of the activity required to supply the ordinary wants of a great city. They are either crowned by cupolas, or covered with slight 1 A distance of about 12 miles separates the mountains on the western side from those of the eastern: the shorter diameter being about eight miles.CHAP.

These bazars are, as usual, allotted, in separate divisions, to objects of foreign or internal commerce; and, on the sides of each gallery, in the box-like compartments which serve for shops, may be seen saddlers, carpenters, shoemakers, &amp;c., exercising their several callings; whilst objects of commerce from India or Europe, together with the cotton and silk stuffs, the velvets, glass, pottery, &amp;c., of the country occupy the rest of the space. At a period not very remote, Ispahan contained upwards of 600,000 souls; but its population at present scarcely exceeds 150,000.

The Wali of this district, who is also the principal Kurdish chieftain, main tains feudal state in the palace at Sehnah, which is considered as the capital of Kurdistan. The Serai occupies the summit of a hill, around which is the town, containing about 4000 Sunnie, 200 Jewish, and 50 Nestorian Catholic families. 4 The southern district resembles the northern in its general D^tnc^and features, and has, like it, a population chiefly nomadic.

The northern slopes of the latter are furrowed by parallel descending fissures ; and the plain onward is, for the most part, covered with a dense forest, in which are numerous huts, either surrounded by rice^ and corn fields, or, more frequently, by rich orchards: for the fine soil and warm temperature of this part of Persia produce the most luxuriant fruits and vegeta tion. These bounties of nature are, however, accompanied by fevers and other diseases, which are caused by exhalations from the ground. 1 MS. Journal of Mr. A. A. Staunton, R.A. P. 28, Vol. IX.

Productions and forms the western part of this region ; being narrower of Gllan, and closer to the mountains, it is more exposed to periodical inundations than Mazanderan. The orange-tree, sugar-cane, and cotton plant, do not succeed; but, with these exceptions, and a larger cultivation of silk and rice, the other products are nearly the same as in that province. Its commerce is, however, superior, on account of the profits derived from its raw and manufactured silks. The sea trade is through the port of Enzelle; that by land, with Mushed, Herat, Ispahan, and Teheran, takes place principally along the substantial causeway 2 which secures the passage of laden animals during the inundations. Mazanderan, the country of the Mardi, 3 has a superficies and of Mazan- of 8126 square miles; and, owing to its exuberant vegetation, and the indigenous flowers clustering in wild luxuriance round the trees, it is justly considered as the richest portion of Persia. In this elysium of the Kajar princes, the finest elms, cedars, cypress, and box trees abound, in the plain along the Caspian, as well as on the slopes of the Elburz, the higher parts of which are covered with shrubs and brushwood. In addition to European fruits, oranges and pomegranates, silk, cotton and sugar-cane are produced, with rice and other grains in abundance. 4 It possesses, like wise, the mercantile depots of Balfroosh and Amol. On the coast is an abundant fishery of sturgeon, tunny, carp, and salmon ; and from thence is drawn the chief supply of caviar for the Russian market. The capital is Saree, the ancient Zadracarta. 5 These two provinces, together with the others before men tioned, represent the Media Magna of the ancients, which 1 From the people called Kileck.—Ogilby's Asia, p. 26 ; and probably the Gelse of Herodotus, lib.

This province extends from the Kizil U'zen, or borders of Extent of Irak, 1 185 miles northward, to the Russian territory on the Azerbai j an - Aras ; 2 and from the borders of Kurdistan, 3 210 miles, to the Masula mountains ; 4 it, therefore, has a surface of about 25,285 square miles. In addition to the Kendilan or Kurdistan mountains at Mountains, the western border, and those of Masula on the eastern, it is intersected by the Sehend, Kibleh, Kafilan Koh, 5 Sevilan, 6 and their inferior ramifications, which are separated from each other by deep and often rugged ravines, but occasionally opening into extensive valley plains, or table-lands, such as those which run into the country from 'Irak. Although the scarcity of timber and verdure give it an arid appearance, Azerbaijan is one of the finest provinces of Persia; and, wherever the soil has been turned to account by irrigation, it is very productive. Among these cultivated portions may be mentioned the tracts round lake Urumiyah, the plains of Morand on the north of Tabriz, those of Khoi to the N.W,, Ardebil on the east, Lylan, Miana, and others, towards the south; all of which produce madder, with nearly every kind of grain and fruit in abundance. The principal rivers are the Araxes, on the border, with and rivers, its affluent, the Kara su, the Jaghatu, the Sosar-chai, the Aji, and the Salyan, which fall into the salt lake of Urumiyah; and the Kizil U'zen, with its numerous tributaries, which intersect and water the central parts of the district; this last river is afterwards known by the name of the Sefid-rud (the Amardus). 7 The principal towns are Ardebil, Abbas-abad, Mehrand, Siral, and Khoi; the latter is a fortified place, containing 1 In about 36° 10' N. latitude. 2 In 38° 55' N. latitude. 3 In 44° 20' E. longitude.

But the most flourishing part of the province is that which surrounds the shores of lake Urumiyah. On its western and southern sides are Dilman, in the valley of Selmast, a town of about 15,000 inhabitants, with Sas- sanian sculptures in its neighbourhood; 1 Urumiyah (the supposed birth-place of Zoroaster), with about 12,000, 2 Nak- hodeh, and Ushnei; and So-uj Bolak, 3 with the ancient caves of Karaftu, and the ruins of Shiz at some distance south eastward of the lake. On the eastern side of this body of water are Dehergan and Binab, and beyond the latter is the town of Maraghah, containing about 15,000 inhabitants, and having several fine excavations in the neighbourhood. Descripticncf Tabriz, the seat of government, is a fortified city of some little strength, and is situated in the centre of the province, near a range of arid mountains. It contains about 8000 houses, built, as usual, of sun-dried bricks, good bazars, several mosques, karvanserai's, and an extensive maidan, or square, within the walls. At the south-western extremity of the town is the citadel of All Shah, and near it the remarkable structure called the Ark, intended, as it is said, for an open Musjed, and con structed soon after the time of Harun al Rashid. It occupies three sides of a square, with a massive double wall nearly 100 feet high, having an arched recess in the interior side. The top of the building commands a fine view of the distant mountains towards the west, the plain of Ahmedia, and the numerous villages and inclosed gardens, kiosks, &amp;c., forming the extensive suburbs ; besides that constant adjunct of every oriental city, the cemetery: the size of the latter, owing to earthquakes, 4 cholera, plague, war, and oppression, has been greatly increased at the expense of the population, which, perhaps, does not now exceed 20,000 souls. 5 1 Colonel Shiel's Journey.-Vol. VIII.

In summer the heat of the province is considerable, and Temperature of during winter the cold is intense ; for, although nearly in the province - the latitude of Athens, the elevation of the country causes the snow to remain on the ground for many weeks, during which time a severe frost prevails; the climate is, however, healthy. This province represents Media Atropatene, which bordered Its ancient Media Magna along the line of the Amardus, now the Kizil name ' U'zen, or Golden river, and included the tract northward of that river, as far as the Araxes; it also extended from the Caspian to the same distance westward of Lake Urumiyah. 2 Near the last were the Matiene, and, more eastward, the Cadusians and the Caspians, together with some nomadic tribes. 3 The lake (says Strabo) is on the east of Armenia and Matiene, and is on the north of the latter, as well as of great Media. It lies also towards the south of the people living at the corner of the Hyrcanian Sea. 4 The capital was Gaza, 5 the Azata or Azaga, of Ptolemy. 6 and capital. It is now called Shiz and Takhti-Soleiman, and is the Atro- patenian Ecbatana of Rawlinson. 7 It would, however, appear, that at a remote period this province was designated Southern, or greater Media ; 8 the first country of the Arii at the foot of the Caucasus being Northern Media.

The northern parts of this province are mountainous. One branch quits the great range near the southern portion of Aster-abad, and runs eastward, by Abbas-abad and Nisha- pur, to Mushed, making, with the former, a crescent-shaped mountain district nearly 100 miles in extent where widest. From the vicinity of the capital, this double chain runs W.S.W. to Herat, but with less width than before. A little to the southward of Mushed two branches diverge from the northern roots towards the opposite extremity of the pro vince.

The district of Yezd, one of the most important of these District, oases, produces fruits, silk, and cotton, in abundance, with, however, a more limited supply of grain, owing to the deficiency of irrigation. 1 The city is surrounded with gardens, beyond which there and city of is a sandy plain nearly inclosed by high hills, and at a short Yezd ' distance from the frontiers of Kirman. It contained about 7000 families, one-third of whom are industrious Gabrs. It is of moderate size, well peopled, and cheap, 2 and celebrated for the beauty of the women. 3 Being the great caravan depot between the countries lying east, west, and north, and having the additional advantage of producing carpets, felts, cotton, and superior silk manufac tures, it is a place of greater trade than any other in the empire. 4 At the distance of four farsangs from Yezd is the rich plain of Baft, watered by a fine stream, on which are nume rous country houses; it enjoys a fine temperature. 5 According to native accounts, many of the other oases are extensive, and contain populous towns, such as Khubbus, to Khubbus. the S.E. of Yezd; Tubbus, to the N.E.; Turbut, Kaff, Gunah-abad, and other places; among these may be noticed Bushrewgah, which is said to contain a population of 30,000 souls, and Turshiz; and the latter is described as a perfect garden. 6 Several of the plains and valleys of the mountains are very fine, especially those along the slopes northward of Mushed. The fertile district beyond Kalat Nadiree is 50 or 60 miles in length by 12 or 15 in width; it is well watered, and con tains about 2000 families, who are protected by steep and 1 Captain Christie : Pottinger's Travels, p. 421. 2 Edrisi, p. 419; Tome V., Recueil de Voyages, &amp;c.

It has a citadel, in addition to the exterior walls; these are flanked by towers, and sur rounded by a ditch; and the town, together with the gardens, country-houses, &amp;c., about it, cover a space whose circum ference is equal to about six leagues. 8 Its population was estimated 4 at 100,000, but it now scarcely exceeds 50,000, 5 There are some fine colleges, karvanserais, and a spacious public walk running east and west through the great square; this last contains the gaudy building within which is the famous shrine dedicated to Imam Riza. The people are employed in the manufacture of sword-blades, knives, copper utensils, velvets, silks, and cotton, and also in the preparation of turquoise and other stones, which, together, furnish returns for the caravan trade to Tartary, India, and the interior of the kingdom itself. tow^ofArter Province of Aster-abad lies northward of the abad.

The southern border of Aster-abad abuts on the Elburz, and the northern, which is swampy, chiefly on the Caspian Sea: on the whole, it possesses a degree of beauty and richness seldom equalled, and never surpassed. 8 The chief town (Aster-abad) is clean and respectable; and the view from the heights above, towards the Elburz on one side, and the Caspian on the other, is strikingly rich ; but the air is damp and noxious from exhalations. 9 ^ Eraser's Journey into Khordsdn, pp. 53 and 54 of Appendix.

X.] ANCIENT PARTHIA. 225 This province represents the Hyrcania of Herodotus; 1 and, according to Ptolemy, 2 it touches the Caspian Sea, and lies west of Margiana, east of the Mardians, and. N.E, of Media. Aster-abad and Khorasan together constitute the Parthia Parthia in of Pliny, which had Aria to the east, Media Magna west, generaL Chorasmia north, with Persis and Carmania to the south. 2 The original country, however, or Parthia Proper, was less extensive, being confined to the mountainous district lying between Hyrcania and Aria ; and of this district Hecatompylos was the capital. 4 This at one time formed part of Hyrcania, and being but a poor, mountainous, and wooded country, 5 it was not even of sufficient importance, when it had become independent of Hyrcania, to constitute a separate satrapy; since we find the Parthians serving with three other contingents in the army of Xerxes. 6 But at a later period its sovereignty extended over all the its divisions countries beyond the Tigris and Euphrates, as far as the and cities ' shores of the Red Sea. 7 Ptolemy makes four great divisions of this kingdom; the first, Parthia Proper, was on the borders of Hyrcania, and was called Comisene; the second, lying south of it, was Choroane; the third, Parsetacene; and the last, Tabiene, which formed the south-eastern ex tremity. 8 In addition to Hecatompylos, the capital, he enumerates the cities of Pasacarta, Rhoara, Araciana, Charax, Apamia, Rhagsea, and about 18 others, 9 the positions of which are little known. As a kingdom, Parthia goes back no further than the time of Arsaces (about 256 years B.C.) ; but its cavalry, which was numerous, early obtained a high reputation, in conse quence of the dexterity which it had acquired in the use of the bow while executing a feigned retreat. 1 Lib.

From the eastern side of Cape Jask, it stretches irregularly along Mekran, in the general- direction of N.N.E., as far as its northern extremity; 3 and from thence it runs N.W. about 90 miles to the south-eastern extremity of Khorasan, 4 which province it skirts nearly due west for upwards of 200 miles, as far as the north-eastern extremity of Fars. 5 Passing near Lake Bakhtegan, it proceeds again onward, in a S.S. W. direc tion, to the Jebel-abad mountains, which it follows towards the W.S.W., forming at the same time the northern side of Laristan, 6 as far as the extremity of the last-mentioned province. The surface of Kirman (including Laristan) contains about 72,741 square miles; but, excepting the information derived from the natives, and the accounts furnished by Tavernier, Pottinger, and some other adventurous Europeans, little has been known of the interior of this province since the time of the ancient geographers.

The latter district is of a triangular shape, and takes its name, Moghostan, or Date-tree wood, from the number of date trees growing in the country. 2 Near the western extremity is the river Anamis, now Minnow, or Mina-ab (blue-water), the Harmozia of Nearchus, 3 from whence a beautiful fertile plain, covered with orange-groves, orchards, and vineyards, 4 extends to Minab, the chief town. This place is divided into three parts, called the high, the low, and the middle; the houses in all three are of wood, and the town is surrounded with groves of date-trees. The Nebo of the Arabs (the Conar of the Persians), a kind of soap plant, much used in the baths, abounds in this province. The ancient kingdom of Lar has been recently traversed Gamrdn. along two different lines, from Gamrun (Gambroon), or Bander Abbas, which is its principal port. This place, though exposed to great heat and very unhealthy, contained, as late as the visit of Tavernier, large factories belonging to the English, Dutch, and French nations. 5 The shorter of the lines of route above alluded to passed Routes through northward through Killatoo and the flourishing walled Lar- towns of Taurem and Forg, extending as far as the fron tiers of Fars, a distance of about 98 miles; the greatest part of the country appeared to be well cultivated, and to 1 Ptolemy, book VI., chap. vi. 2 Ogilby's Asia, p. 31. 8 Lieutenant Kempthorne.—Vol. V.

On the northern and southern side of this place is a mountain range of considerable elevation. In addition to the capital there are some small towns and villages, surrounded by fields and gardens, which produce all kinds of grain, madder, cotton, honey, gum (from the babool tree), fruits, and nuts. 5 Westward from Nurmanshir to the capital it is chiefly desert, but with some cultivation about the villages, which are most numerous and thriving in the rocky country between the capital and Fars. 6 The cit y of Kirman is not far from the mountains, and occupies part of a spacious plain, which, is intersected by 1 MS.

In the bazar (which is extensive, and partly covered with elegant domes), are exposed for sale fine shawls, matchlock- guns, numuds, carpets, the celebrated wool of the province, 1 gums, fruits, &amp;c., in addition to fur-skins, silk, tea, coffee, copper utensils, and different articles imported from Bokhara and other countries. The excellent surveys performed by the officers of the islands in the Indian navy have made us well acquainted with the Persian 1 Gulf, on its eastern shores. Fourteen singular precipitous masses of rock form a chain (partly double) of different sized islands, nearly parallel to the coast of Kirman. They are apparently of volcanic origin; and, being almost deprived of vegetation, with the exception of the rich but sickly Kenn, their appearance is strikingly dreary and arid. H ormuz (Ormuz) is the eastern extremity of the chain, isle of Hormuz, and consists of a number of isolated hills of rock-salt and sulphur, which compose a mass of about 15 miles in circum ference, 2 destitute of springs and vegetation, but abounding in copper and iron ore. 3 On a plain, near the northern extremity of the island, are the cisterns and other remains of the once commercial Hormuz; which, in the time of its prosperity, had 4000 houses and 40,000 inhabitants. 4 The port and anchorage, which gave such importance to its port, the spot, are within two miles of the town. The present inhabitants number about 300, and these are employed in pre paring rock-salt, from which the Imam of Maskat (Muscat), as proprietor, derives a considerable revenue.

These districts, together with the different islands, formed part of the territory of Mithropastes at the time of the visit of Nearchus, who learned from this monarch that the tomb on the island of Tyrina (Kishm) was that of Erythras, 2 whose name was given to the adjoining part of the sea. 3 1 Ptolemy, book VI., chap. viii.

The women are fair, and of the ordinary size; whilst, on the contrary, the men are of a slight, tall, bony make, and are inclined to be rather muscular. Owing to their activity and temperate habits, they are comparatively free from disease; and they generally attain a considerable age, a hundred years not being very uncommon. 1 The inhabitants of this kingdom consist of two great classes; viz., those who labour, and those who subsist by other means. Shepherds, cultivators, mechanics, artisans, shopkeepers, &amp;c., belong to the inferior; whilst mirzas, magistrates, lawyers, merchants, physicians, ecclesiastics, and courtiers, belong to the superior classes. The supreme government is managed by the sovereign, who is absolute master of the lives and property of his subjects. The Shah's person is held sacred; and this character is supported by the dazzling splendour of his court, and the high-sounding titles with which he is approached, such as Shah-in-Shah, 3 Kibla-e-Alem, 3 &amp;c. 1 Ogilby's Asia, p. 42. 2 King of Kings, and Celestial Germ of Heavenly Race.-Malcolm's History of Persia, Vol. I., p. 545. y 3 Point of the Adoration of the World.—Sketches of Persia, Vol. II., p. 138.CHAP. XI.] PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES. 233 Governments of the first class are intrusted to the Shah's Chiefs of sons and near relatives, who become sardars (viceroys, oj .?^ 111068 - satraps), and are merely assisted by a mohussil, or treasurer, sent by the king, to see the revenue collected. The secondary provincial appointments are intrusted either to begler or kulom begs, according to their importance. The towns have either a hak'm (mayor), or a calenter (a higher class of magistrate); the small districts an inferior officer, called a zabut; and the villages a chief, or ketkhodah. The mountain and nomad tribes have their own laws, Administration which are administered by the chief as representative of the of sovereign; and his judgments are, in a great measure, guided by patriarchal usage. The fixed inhabitants have two kinds of tribunals: in the one (the sherrah courts), the civil and criminal law are administered, agreeably to the text of the Koran, as well as the traditions of the people, by the Sheikh ul Islam of each city or town, assisted by the kazi. In the other (the Urf courts), the Shah presides, or the governor of a province as his representative, with the assistance of the magistrates and other local authorities, who receive evidence and award punishments short of death. The highest sen tence of the law, as well as the decision in appeals, rests with the sovereign; and it may be observed, that capital punish ments are not particularly frequent. Two centuries since, wisdom, justice, and sobriety formed Education of , - « N , ,. , . princes. (as during the youth of Cyrus) the leading objects oi the princes' education from the age of fourteen. In the present day, the princes are taught to observe the external forms of decorum and religious ceremonies. At seven years of age, a course of grammar, logic, sacred law, and philosophy, is commenced; riding, field sports, and martial exercises then follow; and with these the education may be said to termi nate. From his earliest years, the heir to the throne hears little except extravagant compliments, and witnesses on every side a blind submission to his will. It is, therefore, not surprising that the monarch should feel persuaded that the Murray, London, 1827. The Great King.—Ogilby's Asia, p. 80. Shdh Ogli (a holy man's descendant).—Ibid., p. 70. VOL.

In a kingdom where the sovereign obliges even the heir apparent to stand before him at the head of the other princes, etiquette and precedency naturally become objects of the first consideration, especially with the rich and noble. Martial exercises and hunting take the next place ; and in both of these occupations they excel from childhood. Courses of Education is usually intrusted to a mulla, who commences instruction. w ^] 1 grammar, theology, and arithmetic. To these succeed short courses of mathematics, philosophy, geography, astro nomy, history, and biography; but poetry and polemics engross the chief attention of those who are to receive a liberal education. 1 Ordinary instruction is communicated in schools; every town, village, and camp, and most of the large mosques, being provided with a teacher. During the day, boys are taught to read poetry; the study of the Koran follows, and then that of the Persian classics. Those destined to be mullas next study Arabic, logic, law, and theology, which subjects are occasionally followed at one of the colleges by ethics, metaphysics, history, medicine, and astronomy—above all, poetry, in order that the student may be prepared with scraps and sentences suited for every occasion. Literature, The Magian and Pehlevian literature must at one time modern. an have been spread over the whole of Western Asia; but scarcely anything, except the occasional references to them which were made in the reign of Nusheravan (in the sixth century), now exists, 2 and both may almost be said to be lost; unless, indeed, any remnant should be hereafter discovered in the yet undecyphered inscriptions at Persepolis, Sus, and else where in Persia. 3 In later times, the encouragement given by the rival sovereigns of Persia, Ghaznein, and Turkistan, in the tenth century, caused literature to flourish for a time; and it is now slowly recovering from the blighting effects of 1 Elphinstone's Kabul, pp. 188, 189.

The Persians have produced some treatises on medicine, astro nomy, and other sciences, besides some valuable historical 1 and geographical 2 works, as well as others on ethics, theology, and polemics; but it is chiefly in poetry 3 that the Persians excel, and this has been successfully cultivated in every branch. 4 Sculpture, among the Persians, has gone on declining since Sculpture, the Sassanian period; and that of the latter period is far inferior to the sculpture of the Persepolitan age. The paint ings on the walls of the palaces are scarcely superior to those of the Chinese, to which, indeed, they have much resemblance in the brightness of colouring, and in the faults of per spective. The Persian music is superior to that of the Arabs; and in Music, softness it has the advantage of the Turkish ; but the violins, cymbals, drums, and tambourines of all these people are nearly equally rude. Over the whole of Persia may be seen that delicate kind of Architecture, arch, which, with some modification, constitutes the principal feature of the Saracenic, Moorish, Gothic, and Saxon archi tecture ; and here, as elsewhere, it is made to spring from light pillars, much ornamented. The palaces, mosques, col leges, bazars, khans, domes, tanks, and light bridges of this kingdom, are constructed with taste ; and the Persians, being excellent masons, as well as adepts in stucco work, their buildings (private houses especially) are superior to those of the Turks, as well as of most of the other eastern people. But it is in the construction of bunds, open canals, and the mining operations connected with that important work the Kahreez, that the Persians most excel. 1 Such as Mirkhoud's History of the Kings, Prophets, and Khahfs; Ta- barl (Chronicles); the Universal History of Al-beydawi; the Jihdn Ara, &amp;c. 2 Such as the Wonders of Creation, the Seven Climates, &amp;c. s The SMh Ndmeh', of Ferdusi (their Homer), and Ansari (king of poets), graced the eleventh century. . * Sadi, Ahii Muhammed Nizdmi, and the soft but lofty strains ot Hahz, are well known. 2 H 2* Imports.

In addition to objects of the first necessity, such as shoes, clothes, carpenters and smiths' work, silk, woollen, and cotton goods, carpets, felts, cutlery, jewellery, china, earthen ware and copper utensils, are prepared by the people, who have thus not only the means of carrying on an internal trade, but likewise of making exports. Copper, silver, and gold, are coined in the mints of Shiraz and Teheran. The imports most in demand are lambskins for caps. Cash mere shawls, Indian and British muslins, calicoes and stuffs; spices, sugar-candy, fine cloths, opium, henna, indigo, tea, fine china and Nankin; together with muskets, Russian or Ger man hardware, cutlery, cloths, needles, looking-glasses, beads, &amp;c. But the greatest impediments to an exchange of commodi ties exist in the country, on account of the deficiency of sea ports, rivers, canals, roads, and wheel carriages; for the only ports are Abu-Shehr, Mohammarah, and Recht; and from these, goods must necessarily be transported on the backs of animals, alternately across the wide-spreading saline tracts, and the arid mountain-ridges which separate the cities and cultivated districts from each other. The nature of the cli mate limits the time of travelling to the autumn and spring, when the caravans are exposed either to attacks by robbers in passing by the routes of the desert, or to the vexatious imports levied in the towns. But the ordinary wants of man, and the love of gain, triumph over all these impediments ; and caravans have in all ages traversed the steppes of Persia and Central Asia, notwithstanding the changes those countries have undergone from wars, tumults, conquests, and revo lutions. The great caravan lines are in five directions. The first passes westward from Central Persia towards Baghdad Meso- potamia, Syria, and Asia Minor.

And finally, a fifth proceeds to India by two distinct lines, which unite at Herat. One of these routes comes to this town fromCHAP. XI.] CARAVANS, COMMERCE, ETC. 237 'Irak, and the south-western provinces of the kingdom, through Shiraz; and the other from the north-west, by Teheran, Nishapur, and Mushed. Eastward of Herat, how ever, the united lines pass through Kandahar, Kabul, and Jellalabad, to Attock, from whence it branches out to dif ferent parts of India. The value of the different commodities enumerated by Lieut. Annual Conolly as being sent along this route, cannot well be less thScommerce. than 800,000/. sterling in the course of the year. The trade through Recht, Balfroosh, and other ports on the shores of the Caspian, amounts to nearly 400,000/. The purchases made by Persians with cash at Constantinople during the years 1840 and 1841, amounted to 570,000/. each. As the port of Abu-SMhr sends to India goods to the value of 400,000/., exclusive of the trade from Mohammarah; if to these be added the caravan trade to Aleppo and Baghdad, there will be an export trade amounting to about two mil lions. Therefore, as something like a balance must prevail, the commerce of the modern provinces 1 can scarcely be much short of four millions annually. The ordinary revenue of Persia is derived from duties levied Sources of revenue. on the preceding commerce; from rent-charges of different kinds, such as the produce of crown lands, mills, water courses, public buildings, and capitation taxes; 2 and from the imposts upon cattle. These, from a rough estimate, produce between six and seven millions of tomans, and do not include what is levied by annual fines and confiscations, nor the saa- derant raised for troops, couriers, and the royal retinue when travelling. These last exactions are amongst the heaviest grievances to which the Persian people are exposed; and but a small part, either of these taxes or of the surplus revenue of each district, finds its way to the public exchequer. Agreeably to the ancient customs of the east, the viceregal Numerous courts resemble that of the sovereign; and the support of these is the heaviest charge which is borne by the people.

Shah Abbas abolished the inefficient system of provincial troops and militia, by revert ing to the ancient practice of keeping up a regular army; and during Chardin's travels, the numerical strength of this force was equal to about 80,000 men. 2 At present, the standing army, exclusive of the Kurdish and other irregular cavalry, consists of fourteen battalions of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and six or eight troops of artillery, or nearly 13,000 men, who have been brought into an efficient state by British officers, and are supported at a very trifling cost; 3 but the commissariat is very defective, irregular The bravery of the men has been sufficiently shown in the late attacks on Herat, and at the storming of Bast, as well as on other occasions. Moreover, they possess the important qualification (for a country like Persia) of cheerfully accom plishing long and difficult marches, even when scantily sup plied with necessaries. The chief force, however, consists of irregulars, which, on an emergency, and with the requisite funds, might exceed 200,000 men; 4 a large proportion being I'liyat cavalry, who perform feudatory service.

XI.'] DRESS OF THE PERSIANS. 239 that of other nations, yet its cost, together with the expenses of the household, consume nearly the whole of the public revenue. Had it been otherwise, the extreme parsimony of the late king would have enabled him to leave a richer trea sury than that which fell to the lot of Muhammed Shah. 1 The Persian dress differs greatly from that of the Turks : Walking and the curling hair of the men falls behind a high, pointed, black g lambskin cap; and, instead of the ample flowing garments of the Sunnie, the Shi'ah is to be distinguished by a dark caba, or coat, fitting very close to the shape as far as the waist, with tight sleeves, left open towards the wrists, a rolled shawl girdle, containing a short dagger, or, if the wearer be a mirza, the writing materials. The lower part of the garment, how ever, is loose as far as the ancles; and this, to a stranger, gives him a feminine appearance ; 2 especially with the addition of high-heeled green slippers, or the shoes made of quilted cotton or leather, which usually form part of the walking dress. When mounted, boots replace the shoes, and a pair of loose trowsers (shulwars), which are sufficiently large, not only to inclose the skirts of the coat, but occasionally to carry some provision for the journey. On these occasions, an outer caba, or loose cloak, is added, not unfrequently of sheepskin, with the fur inside. 3 A garment of the latter kind, or more fre quently of thick, pliant felt, thrown loosely over the shoulders, a high, pointed felt cap, with cloth bandages round the legs, compose the usual winter attire of the shepherd, the mule teer, and poorer peasant.

Dresses and^ mantle, form the usual costume of the superior class of women, the women. with the addition, however, of pearls, rings, and armlets. Their hair, which is adorned with pearls, and gold or silver coins, falls in thick tresses behind, in a manner far more be coming than that of the Turkish dames. Within doors, their attire (as I observed from the terraces during my visits to Shuster and Dizful in 1831) is both slight and simple. The head was enveloped in a large kerchief, generally black; and a kind of white bedgown, with a pair of loose trowsers and high-heeled slippers, completed the dress. Out of doors, the Persian female strictly follows the ancient style of dress. Those of the middle class wear wide trowsers, pressed into ample yellow boots, with an upper garment either of white or dark cotton. This is very loose, and is covered with a checked cloth of such ample dimensions, that it envelopes the whole person, with the exception of a small portion of the face, which may be seen through a kind of gauze mask. The rnW-cky Their cookery is superior to, although it resembles, that of the Turks. The mid-day meal is chiefly of vegetables, the more substantial one being soon after sun-set, when those who can aftord it display a variety of tempting viands, served either in a well-lighted room, or (during warm weather) on a ter race, amidst shaded candles and ornamented lamps. Tepid water and soap having been handed to the guests, who are seated round a leather cloth, with cakes of bread before each, the dishes are brought in, either on low wooden tables, or on a number of metal trays, one of which is usually allotted to three or four individuals. Lighter matters, such as cakes, curds, dried sweetmeats, with lemonade, and different beverages' prepared with milk, are consumed before the more substantial viands are introduced: these are ragouts, and meats stewed in rich sauces, or roasted on little skewers ; together with pil- laus, s P lce(i or plain, and piles of rice, or of rice and peas heaped over the meat. With the exception of the light pear-tree rinkmg spoons for the iced sherbets and various preparations of milk the food is taken up with the fingers, and dispatched so speedily, that but a momentary interval seems to pass, from ie brief bismillah of the host, until the fragments on theCHAP. XI.] DIET, AND HOUSES. 241 trays are transferred to the attendants, and warm water is again carried round. Kailiuns, coffee or tea (the latter rarely), are then brought in, and renewed at intervals: but occasion- ally, when the number of guests is limited, the forbidden pleasures of opium, wine, and spirits are enjoyed. 1 The ordi nary townspeople, however, have, as may be supposed, less tempting fare, and the inferior shopkeepers are wont to supply themselves from the kabob, or cook-shops in the bazaars. Although poultry and meat are not by any means scarce, Dietin general, the chief part of the diet in Persia is of a much lighter de scription. It consists of eggs, boiled rice, or wheat prepared in the same manner, bread, hard cheese, koroot, 2 clarified butter, and coagulated milk in the state called mast. The latter is boiled, without taking away the butter, and then by adding to the new milk, when cold, either some rennet, or a por tion of the old stock (Mayal), a slightly acid but agreeable beverage is produced, particularly for summer. It seems to agree admirably with the Persians ; and that it has continued to do so for ages is sufficiently clear, by the fact that Pliny mentions it, with an observation that it was in use before the sowing of corn was known. 3 The cottages of the poor are built either of earth, or of Cottages, layers of bricks, usually unburnt, and cemented with mud, mixed with chopped straw; and they seldom contain more than two small rooms. The roofs are terraced on beams, when wood is to be had ; but at other times, four or more low brick domes cover the building. In general, there are two or three small out-houses, built in the same manner, for cattle, grain, and implements of husbandry, the whole being well inclosed, and having only one small, low entrance-door into the court. The houses of the rich are likewise surrounded by a high Dwellings of .'l 0 the superior dead wall, inclosing different sets of apartments, built round classes, as many separate courts or little gardens, which generally 1 ' When I took leave, the MuM filled ray baracho with very good wine.' —Tavernier's Persian Travels, p. 44. * Another preparation of mast, which being dried in the sun and rolled into thin wafers, will keep throughout a distant pilgrimage. 8 Lib.

These apartments are appropri ated to various purposes : some of them constitute the harem khanah, and others, the public rooms for company; the rest are occupied by servants, or are used as stables. The diwan khanah, or reception hall, like that of the Turks, is supported by tall wooden pillars, with light and ornamented arches. It is generally open at one extremity, and the host is seated at the other, near the entrance of an inner and more private apartment. The Persian rooms are extremely simple, having neither tables, drawers, chairs, nor stools ; a rich carpet at the upper extremity* and some thick namads at the lower, with a few ornamented lamps, being all that appears till the meals are brought from the harem to be placed before the guests. With the exception of the busy bazars, khans, and mosques, a Persian town presents only a succession of narrow streets between dead walls, and generally encumbered with filth and the ruins of houses. The villages are in a great degree simi lar to the towns; and from the necessity of obtaining pro tection for the inhabitants, the cattle and the grain, they are almost invariably walled ; gardens or orchards surround them, and beyond these is the cultivated ground. But though towns and permanent villages are numerous, a large portion of the people constantly live in tents; and to tents the inhabitants of the towns also resort during their frequent and distant pilgrimages. The tents used by the better classes on such occasions are spacious, lofty, and much ornamented with bright and gaudy colours. They are of canvas or thick cotton, with high walls, which, as well as the top, are generally lined; and the former is usually stif fened with spreaders at short intervals. There are separate inclosures for the servants and the harem, and the latter is surrounded by an outer inclosure of the same materials. The details of pitching and striking the tents are, from frequent practice, performed with order and facility. The erratic tribes use tents covered with a kind of coarse black cloth, chiefly of goat's or camel's hair. They are some times single, but more frequently double, and they afford an excellent shelter from the weather, as the threads swell whenCHAP. XI.] MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. 243 wetted, and thus become impervious to the rain. The tent of the common people is from 20 to 25 feet long, by 10 or 12 feet broad, 8 or 9 high in the centre, and 3 or 4 at the sides, which are usually closed by reed-mats, instead of hair-cloth. It is supported by two, and occasionally, when the size is considerable, by three or more poles in a row; and the space within is divided by a curtain, so as to separate the apartment of the men from that of the women. In Persia, as in Barbary and in most parts of the East, Formalities the. preliminaries of a marriage are (without the parties marriage, having met) carried on by a female relative, who first sounds the mother of the lady, and then a formal deputation on the part of the youth is sent to the parents of,,the latter. Being affianced, the suitor endeavours to obtain the sum which he has agreed to pay; whilst, on the other hand, a provision is made by way of dower, consisting of some clothes, but chiefly carpets, cooking apparatus, china-ware, and household utensils. These matters of detail vary according to the wealth of the parties, and, in the case of the rich, are pro vided immediately; whilst the poorer people sometimes re quire a year or two for making good the arrangements. The contract stipulating for a provision in case of divorce, or the death of the husband, is then drawn out, and is signed by the kazi, or a mulla, in the presence of witnesses. On the appointed evening the bride is conducted to the Rejoicings on house of her husband, accompanied by the relatives, friends, the occasion - and neighbours of both parties, with bands of music and singers, firing of muskets, and other noisy rejoicings. Among humble individuals these festivities conclude with a supper; while the rich make a ruinous display, which con tinues during many successive days. 1 In addition to the permanent marriages, which, for each man, are restricted to four, others of a temporary nature take place in the presence of the kazi; when the woman, 1 Chardin describes the festivities of a great wedding at Ispahan, which lasted fourteen days, with a succession of guests; the courtiers, king's favour ites, generals, pontiffs, chancellors, secretaries, and men of note, including the sovereign, being received successively in conformity to rank and etiquette. —-Voyage, Tome VI., p. 213.244 festivals and entertainments.

Amusements of At home the Persian of distinction spends his time chiefly in the harem, where the household affairs, and even the matters which relate to the stables, are regulated. Abroad he lounges in the public baths, or amuses himself with hawking, hunting, wolf-baiting, throwing the jereed, and other martial exercises : splendid arms and fine horses (some of them, for show, being stained of an orange or pink colour) are objects in which he highly delights. Mutual visits con sume a large portion of the day, when the guests (seated on the rich carpets in the Biroum) are amused with fortune tellers, jugglers, buffoons, story-tellers, music, draughts, cards, fireworks, illuminations, and, more rarely, professed dancers, singing in chorus. 3 These entertainments are most splendid on such occasions as the feast of the new moon, 4 that of free dom when alms are given, 5 and the Bei'ram : also on the festival of the new year (Nau-ruz), the offering of the camel, 6 and that of roses; but especially the commemoration of the death of Ali, of which there is then a lengthened representa tion, so well managed as to produce, on the part of the audience, loud sobs and other outward symptoms of grief, people tlie The exercise of their several callings in the bazar, the cheap luxury of the bath, and meeting in coffee-houses to 1 Ogilby's Asia, p. 57. a Ibid. 3 Ibid., p. 79.

In the country, instead of frequent ing the bath and coffee-house, the intervals of leisure between the agricultural labours of the fixed inhabitants, and the pastoral occupations of the nomadic people, are filled up by listening to tales, stories, and the recital of portions of the Koran. Wrestling, and other athletic exercises, serve occa sionally to vary the seeming monotony of their lives. Making men's clothes (at least in part), sewing, spinning, Occupations, • t i • J j. 1 j-1 0 * ™ ie embroidery, cooking, and keeping accounts, appear to be me women, ordinary occupations of the women at home ; and garden, or country parties, chiefly on Friday, with visits to their friends in the baths, as well as at their houses, constitute the chief amusements abroad. It is not the custom, even for husbands, to interfere with these pleasures; and the women of Persia enjoy more liberty than we are accustomed to associate in idea with the seclusion of a harem. They have, moreover, the advantage of a better education than is given to the ladies in Turkey. In the country the women sew, spin, bake, cook, prepare milk and cheese, and fetch water ; in addition to which a portion of the agricultural or pastoral labour devolves upon them. While engaged in such occupa tions, they are necessarily less secluded than at other times, and are only partially veiled. Unless a death happen to take place during the night, the Funerals, funeral follows immediately after it. The body is washed with rose-water; then, being wrapped in a white sheet and cotton shroud, it is carried on a bier to the grave, where the priest, having read some passages from the Koran, throws earth'on the body as it is finally deposited in the ground. No coffin is provided, and the corpse is placed on its right side, with its face towards the west. If the deceased be rich, a funeral feast is kept for several days after the ceremony, and alms are distributed at particular intervals. But when a person of rank dies, it is not unusual for the king to com mand the body to be conveyed to Mesjid-Ali, or one of the other places of Shi'ah pilgrimage ; followed by his charger bearing the arms, clothes, &amp;c., of the deceased, and also by246 STATE OF MORALS.

He is notorious for a total disregard of truth, and for the fraud with which his ordinary dealings are con ducted. He is devoid of shame in private life, and as insen sible to disgrace in public; and, provided he can escape punishment, the most dishonest artifices are viewed as legiti mate means of accomplishing his ends. He is guilty of the most shameful debauchery, and superstitious as well as hypo critical in religious matters. He is also faithless in friend ship, subject to *strong prejudices, and of a revengeful dis position. His minor faults are garrulity and a love of vain display, to which last even personal comforts and cleanliness are too often sacrificed; he is remarked for a dogmatical and egotistical bearing, and a haughty demeanour towards in feriors, with, as usual in such dispositions, the utmost ser vility towards those above him. Their polite- This dark picture is not, however, without brighter spots. Owing to his politeness towards strangers, and an apparently hospitable disposition, the first meeting with a Persian usually makes a favourable impression; though the offer of his house means no more than the Spanish compliment in like cases. 2 He is, moreover, quick-sighted, 3 sociable, witty, and affable; buoyant in spirits, well acquainted with the forms of politeness, and, to a certain extent, inquisitive in matters of science and art; and, it may be added, of a tolerant disposition in religious matters, unless when his prejudices against the Sunnies happen to be awakened. Though not now confined to water and the simple diet of the time of Cyrus, 4 the Persian is moderate in his food, and not only capable of changing the sloth of his harem for most active 1 Ogilby's Asia, pp. 55, 56. 8 The phrase, ' it is yours,' or ' it is at your command,' may be easily traced back from Spain into Barbary, and from thence into Arabia. 8 Ogilby, p. 47. 4 Herodotus, lib. I., cap. Ixxi.CHAP. XI.] MANNERS AND CHARACTER. 247 exertions, but likewise of continuing them under the greatest privations. The courage of the Persian is not of the higher order, but it is far from being defective when brought to the test. The profession of arms, as in ancient times, 1 still occupies the first place in the estimation of a Persian ; and, if any particular trait might be selected to designate a ^character which cannot be trusted, and yet ought not to be despised, it is his application to the exercises of the field, and plundering forays against neighbouring tribes. The Persian, like the modern Kurd and Turkoman, is Skill in horse- almost always mounted; and, having been trained from his man8 ,p ' infancy, he is one of the most expert horsemen in the world. He is, in fact, quite unrivalled in his skilful management of the animal when ascending the steep sides of rocky moun tains, which by most persons would be considered altogether inaccessible for a horseman. The Bakhtiyari and other tribes, maintaining a kind of half independence in the moun tains, are also very expert riders; but every Persian, man and boy, is a finished horseman, and particularly skilful in loading and firing from the back of the animal. 2 Like his Parthian ancestors, he can turn round when pursued, and fire his long gun directly to the rear. He then gallops off at full speed, hanging down from his saddle on the off side in such a way that the greater part of his body is covered by the horse. It is not an uncommon thing to see a Persian, whilst going at a brisk pace, stoop down, take a sheep, or even a much smaller object from the ground, and carry it off with un- relaxed speed. 3 The habits of the Persians are decidedly predatory ; their Propensity to robberies are of daily occurrence, and are committed without pl respect to persons; for, in addition to the more ordinary instances which I witnessed during my journey in 1831, the 1 Herodotus, lib. II., cap. clxvii. 2 The sling is just of sufficient length to allow of its supporting the piece over the left wrist, whilst the hand grasps the muzzle, so as to facilitate the loading. 3 On one occasion, a fowling-piece, belonging to Lieutenant Lynch's party, was thus taken up from the ground, but the timely use of a rifle recovered it.248 PREDATORY HABITS. [CHAP. XI. subjects of Fat-h All Shah were observed hanging on his rear as he moved from his encampment towards Ispahan, with the same desire to appropriate a part of his baggage to them selves, if the opportunity had occurred, as they would have manifested had he been an enemy. Scarcely any other civilized country with which we are acquainted contains so few inhabitants, or those of such a mixed description, as Persia in her present state ; and even of these, a large proportion live apart, wandering from place to place with their flocks, in the very heart of the community of which they form a constituent, and, in one respect, an influ ential portion, since they supply a large part of the military force of the kingdom. These wanderers have the name I'lyats, by which the Per sians designate the whole of those tribes who subsist by their flocks, and also that portion which is employed in the pearl fishery. h The I'lyats do not admit that they belong to the old Persian stock, but believe themselves to be descended from strangers, who had been attracted by the thirst of conquest, like the Saracens from the west, or the followers of Jengiz Khan, and other adventurers from the east. The I'lyats settled in Persia at a recent period, and have preserved their peculiar habits and customs. The funerals of the Bakhtiyari, for instance, are attended with dancing and other symptoms of rejoicing : and if the man should have been killed in battle, the rejoicings (and this is the case also among the Arabs) are on that account the greater. The I'lyats are brought up in ignorance of almost everything, except tending their flocks, weaving tent cloth, occasional cultivation of the ground, and martial exercises. The head of each tribe is its leader in war, or in the predatory excur sions ; and he practically teaches his hardy followers to despise the peaceable occupations of the cultivators, who, when not sufficiently protected, are frequently plundered of their corn and cattle. The I'lyat chiefs and their families are the only permanent aristocracy of Persia, in which kingdom they occupy a posi tion nearly resembling that of the old feudal chieftain inCHAP. XI.] STATE OF THE 1'LYATS . 249 Europe; and at times they have been raised by their personal talents, aided by fortuitous circumstances, to the throne itself. 1 The smaller communities are governed by the Rish-Safid, Their or elders (grey-beards), who have patriarchal authority i n property ' deciding disputes, and much influence in other respects, par ticularly in the formation of marriages, which are almost invariably confined to the members of the tribe. Their wealth consists in camels, horses, asses, mules, cows, goats, and sheep, with which they move at a certain time from the Kishlak, a warm tract, to the Yailak, or that which is cooler; but the locality is not changed without the shah's permission. They pay a moderate tax upon their cattle and sheep, both of which many of them possess in abundance, and they are besides called upon to equip and furnish his majesty with one horseman and two foot soldiers for every ten families. 2 The I'lyat communities usually consist of twenty or thirty ^ g occupa ' families. They make carpets and tents, and have all things within themselves except clothes, copper utensils, pack- saddles, and personal ornaments for their dress, and these they obtain from the Persians. Being entirely a pastoral people, their property is calculated by the number of animals (more particularly sheep) which they possess. These con stitute the ordinary medium of traffic, and they are sheared twice in each year. 3 Though much concerning this people has been collectedTheAfsMr of late, and many tribes have been visited, 4 yet a great deal remains to be done before the number of these wanderers can be ascertained with any degree of precision. It may be ob served, however, that in those parts which have been explored, the population proves to be more numerous than had been 1 Fat-h 'AH Shdli, grandfather of the present sovereign, was an instance of this sudden elevation. 2 Morier on the I'lyats of Persia, Vol. VII.

Allowing one-fourth for the usual exaggerations of the east, there would still be about 600,000 families, which, at an average of four and a half persons to each, would give 2,700,0001'lyats. The revenue understood to have been collected in 1830 and 1831 on the Kanats and families, gave six millions for the cultivators, manufacturers, and other fixed inhabitants of the towns and villages of Persia. The grand total is, therefore, about eight millions. This is widely different from the forty millions of subjects, which was the number estimated by Chardin. It must not, however, be forgotten that Abbas II. possessed nearly the whole of 'Iran; and if that territory were included, there would be, according to the preceding calculations, a population of upwards of thirty millions. It may not be unacceptable in this place to introduce a table which will put it in the power of the reader to compare the preceding account with the state of I'ran about nine centuries since, at which time much attention appears to have been paid to the population and revenue of the country. Ancient As early as the close of the second century of the Hijrah statistics. guide-books were written, which, according to Ibn Haukal, contained a description of the curiosities to be found in the different towns; and likewise a detailed account of the land and other taxes, the factories, productions, and traffic by ships as well as caravans. Abu Yusuf has made a statement of the revenue in the time of Harun al-.Rashid : Ibn Khallikan has given in much detail that of a portion of the empire; and Ibn Khaldun has collected with great care accounts of the productions of 36 provinces; 1 but the following extracts made by Dr. Aloys Sprenger, M.D., from the valuable manu script copy written by Ibn Khordadbeh, 630 a. h ., con tain ample and most interesting details on this subject. 2 The 1 Translated by Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall, Table of the Revenue of the Muhammedan Empire in the time of Maimun.

XI.] PRIVILEGES OF THE MUSLIMS. 253 regulations of the Khaliph. Omar became the model in subse- Allotment of quent times for the adjustment of the tribute to be paid by e the conquered provinces. Being pressed to apportion such tribute, this prince replied that, if he were to divide the land amongst his followers, there would not be any thing left for those Muslims who should succeed him; whereas, if it remained with its present possessors, it would furnish munitions of war in addition to a yearly tribute. And to secure these objects he made the following arrangements, by which, as will be seen, the Muhammedans constituted a privileged aristocracy, whose attention was directed entirely to conquest. The government laid down by Omar, in agreement with the conditions of Muhammed, was founded on the Koran and the traditions of the Prophet; and the original law was, that the Muslim should not pay any taxes to government: the only duty of the true believer was to give the alms defined by law, i. e., the tithes of those products of the land which are not perishable, as corn, dates, &amp;c.; and one in forty from cattle, sheep, &amp;c. (but not from horses) ; he was also to pay the toll for wares imported or exported, which was usually one in forty, or two and a half per cent, of the value. All these duties were destined for beneficial purposes; as for the poor, for releasing Muslim prisoners, keeping up roads, providing for travellers, &amp;c. The third part of the khams 1 was employed for the same purposes ; whilst the khaliphs appropriated to themselves, after some dispute, the two other parts ; these were destined for God, his Prophet, and the relations of the latter. Government, and the army, which consisted of volunteers, and of the were entirely supported by the dzemmis or people under pro tection, i. e. such nations as refused to accept the Muham- medan religion at all, or at least not before fighting. To those the conditions which were made when they capitulated or were subdued were to be kept sacred. The pay of the soldiers con sisted of four-fifths of the booty, and sometimes of lands, con sidered as booty, which were called 'Ikta ah. The unbelievers who submitted to the flood of conquest were offered the 1 Khams is the fifth part of the booty taken by fighting, also the fifth part of mines, pearls, and generally of any thing which is not obtained by cultivation.254 TAXES LEVIED ON CHRISTIANS, ETC. [CHAP. XL Taxes paid by benefit of Islamism : if they received it, they were to enjoy the the Rayah. same rights as the Muslims ; if not, they were asked whether they would pay the land and capitation taxes, and if they refused to do this, they were attacked by the sword. The conditions, however, varied for different nations. It was a general rule that they should pay double the toll, i. e. five per cent.; that the rich should pay forty-eight dirhems a year capi tation tax ; the middling class twenty-four dirhems; and the poor (working men) twelve dirhems; women, children, and persons unable to work, paid nothing. 1 But Omar ben Abd-el-Aziz went so far as to calculate what a man could in a year gain hy working, and what he could subsist upon, and he claimed all the rest, amounting to four or five dinars a year. The capitation tax was called Jizyah and sometimes Kharaj-ar-rowos. The principal revenue from the dzemmis was the land tax, which was sometimes so much increased as to be half the pro duce of the land. The technical term for all the taxes from the people under protection, and the tribute from enemies not brought under subjection by force of arms, was Fay. Super fide 8 of The khaliph commenced with the Sowad or cultivated 'Irak, which is 125 farsangs long, and 80 broad; the square mea sure is, therefore, 10,000 farsangs: each farsang is equal in length to 12,000 cubits 2 of those which are called Morsdah, 3 or to 9,000 Hashemite cubits, and a square farsang is equal to 22,500 jeribs, 4 so that 10,000 square farsangs give 225,000,000 jeribs. For regulating the land tax, 75,000,000 jeribs were deducted in consideration of the mountains, rivers, towns, &amp;c., therefore 150,000,000 jeribs remained, half of which, accord ing to Mas udi, were cultivated, and the other half left for pasturage, &amp;c. The capitation tax ceased as soon as they became Muslims. Ibn Khordadbeh states, that 25 such farsangs make a degree. Koehler, in his preface to Abu-l-fedd's Syria, takes 18f farsangs to a degree. 3 Such a cubit is equal to 144 grains of barley placed side by side, accord ing to Ibn Khordadbeh and Rev. S. Lee's Ibn Batuta, p. 34, note. Jerib is the name of a measure of land, and the corn which such land pro duces in the first instance is stated to be equal to 60 sds square. Kefaya, com mentary on the Hedaya.CHAP. XI.] ALLOTMENT OF THE TAXES. 255 From the Sowad were taken, as land tax, two-fifths of the Taxes paid by produce of wheat and barley, if the field was watered naturally; that prov,nce ' three-tenths of the produce of wheat and barley, if the field was artificially watered by means of wheels or Kanats ; one-third of the produce of dates and grapes; and one-third of the growth of gardens ; also one-fourth of the spring-harvest. This was given partly in kind, and partly in money. It seems that it was ascertained, in the survey of Omar, how much ground there was for barley, palms, &amp;c., in the Sowad ; because under Kobad, only the general regulation was made, that 1 dirhem should be paid for each of these 150,000,000 jeribs. The further divisions were probably left to the inhabitants, as is done in India. But Omar settled distinctly, that for every jerib of field (if the above parts were not given in kind) there should be delivered 1 kafiz of the produce and i dirhem in money, whether the field had been ploughed or left in pasture. Besides this, there were to be paid, for 1 jerib of grapes, 10 dirhems; accord ing to another tradition, 8 dirhems; for 1 jerib of sugar, 6 dir hems ; 1 jerib of wheat, 4 dirhems ; 1 jerib of barley^ 2 dirhems; 1 jerib of sesame, 5 dirhems; 1 jerib of cotton, 5 dirhems; 1 jerib of spring-harvest, 3 dirhems. 1 According to the price of corn at that time, we shall find Cost of wheat, that 56 lbs. of wheat cost 1 dirhem, the price of two-fifths of a jerib having been fixed at 5 dirhems, or Ls-. 10r/. nearly, after deducting 64 lbs. (1 kafiz) from 768 lbs. (the produce of one jerib). This will allow a correct estimate to be made of the money Value of the value at that period. Moreover, it is to be remarked, that the dirhems of the time of Omar had a value equivalent to 1 dirhem and 2^ daniks ; 2 in the time of Harun-al-Rashid they had the weight of 1 mithkal, 3 and were no doubt Persian money. No tax was paid for forage, nor for any of those products which are perishable, such as melons, dates, cucumbers, &amp;c., whilst from all those which can be preserved, as corn, nuts, almonds, linseed, oil, &amp;c., the kheraj was to be delivered; but according to some doctors, only when the quantity of corn exceeded that 1 Abu Yusdf, in his Letter to Harun-al-Rashid, fol. 23, recto. 2 Six daniks make a dirhem. 3 One mithkal is equal to 1J dirhem.chap. xi.] tributes of other districts. 257 The districts of the Tigris, together, paid 8,500,000 dirhems. Kufah with its environs belonged in 358 a.h ., when Ibn tax paid by Haukal visited this city, to the diwan of Baghdad, and paid u a ' 30,000,000 dirhems a year as kheraj. Under Maimun, the kheraj amounted to 37,780,000 dirhems, and there were, besides, 14,800,000 dirhems of other duties. Basrah paid in the same year (358) 6,000,000 dirhems. According to Ibn Khaldun, the country between Basrah and Kufah paid to Maimun 10,700,000. Hirah, when first conquered by Khaled, paid 80,000 dir hems land tax ; and the male inhabitants amounted to 7000, of whom 6000 paid the capitation tax. The tribute of all the Sowad, at the time of the Khosroes By the Sowad, Kobad, amounted to 150,000,000 dirhems; at the time of &amp;c ' Omar ben Khattab, to 120,000,000 dirhems; in the reign of Abd-ullah ben Said, to 135,000,000 dirhems; under Hejaj ben Yusuf, to 18,000,000 dirhems, into which do not enter 100,000,000 which were raised illegally; under Omar ben Abd-el-Aziz, the province paid 124,000,000 or 120,000,000 dirhems ; under Ibn Hobeira, 100,000,000 dirhems; and under Yusuf ben Omar, 170,000,000 dirhems. Abu Yusuf (fol. 18, recto) states, that the kheraj of the Sowad did not amount to more than 1,000,000 dirhems previously to the death of Omar ben Khattab, but this must be a fault of the transcriber.

When Omar was Khaliph, he had the intention of introducing throughout all Arabia the same religion and laws; and the Nejranites who refused to conform he obliged to leave their country: but he gave them some villages in 'Irak, where they settled, retaining their former name, Nejrani.

It must be admitted, however, that in this investigation there is little to guide the inquirer beyond the very brief description which is contained in the book of Genesis; and the difficulty of the research is the greater, as the designations given in the scriptures must be traced among those which were imposed by a people, whose language, in all probability, differed from that of the Pentateuch, and who, moreover, took possession of the tracts about the Black and Caspian seas, after those tracts had ceased to be called by their original names. It may be added, in order to account for the uncertainty which prevails respecting the Pison and Gihon, that the rivers which are presumed to have borne those designations, flow in a direction contrary to that of the Tigris and Euphrates, and wateredCHAP. XII.] PISON AND GIHON. 267 countries which were inhabited by tribes having little inter course with the Jews; and thus their connexion with the site of Paradise may, subsequently to the time of Moses, have ceased to be remembered. Under such discouraging circumstances, any attempt to Havikb and elucidate the geography of Eden might have been deemed (ju8h ' hopeless, if it were not that many indications afforded by the character and natural productions of the country presented themselves to me during the progress of my rather extensive researches in that part of the world. From these, and from the fact that the sources of the Euphrates and Tigris, and of two other great rivers, exist within a very circumscribed space in Armenia, I have been led to infer that the rivers known by the comparatively modern names of Halys and Araxes, are those which, in the book of Genesis, have the names of Pison and Gihon; and that the country within the former is the land of Havilah, whilst that which borders upon the latter is the still more remarkable territory of Gush. Some of the indications alluded to will be found in the description already given of the four rivers themselves, in the first, second, and third chapters; and the reader is referred to what follows for other corroborations of the hypothesis which has been adopted respecting the locality of the terrestrial Paradise, as a part of the more extensive territory of Eden. According to the tradition fondly cherished in the wild Traditional valleys of Central Armenia, the tract allotted to our first 81te of Eden ' parents,—or, as the Hebrew expresses it, the Paradise in Eden towards the east, 1 included the northern division of the pashalik of Musul, and it extended from this part of Assyria to some little distance north of Erz-Rum: its western extre mity was in the vicinity of Tokat, towards the Halys, whilst the eastern boundary included some portion of the district beyond lake Van. This extensive and still fertile tract of country comprehends, as will be presently seen, the early settlements of two of the branches descended from Noah It coincides nearly with that which originally constituted the principal part of Greater and Lesser Armenia; and within its 1 Genesis ii. 8. 2 M 2268 SOURCES OF FOUR RIVERS. [CHAP. XII. limits are the elevated ranges of Ararat and Nimrud, which form parts of the vast chain of the Taurus. Sources of four Without attaching particular importance to local impres- nversnear . . ti i-i Ararat. sions, it must be admitted that those traditions which place Eden in that part of Asia, acquire a certain degree of proba bility from the fact, that we actually find in the great plateau round Ararat,—that is, within a circle whose radius is about ninety miles,—the sources of four noble rivers, which flow from thence to as many different seas, and of which two, at least, are known, from the description given in the Bible, to have been connected with the first abode of man. Various Scarcely any subject has given rise to such diversity of ceming S Eden. 0 pi n i on as the site of Paradise. Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Arabia, Central Asia, and, indeed, almost every other division of the earth's surface, has, in turn, laid claim to the distinction of inclosing within its boundaries this interesting spot. The fact that the Euphrates and Tigris are two of the rivers of Eden appears, however, to limit the inquiry con cerning the position of the Garden to the countries in the vicinity of both ; but hitherto the evidences in favour of any particular place within this tract have been so little conclu sive, that two districts very distant from each other, and totally different in soil, climate, and geographical features, have, by different persons, been assigned as the most probable situations. One of these is in the parched plains towards the lower part of the courses of the rivers, and the other is the mountainous country about their sources. Reason for The circumstances now about to be presented to the reader's piadng it near notice willj it is hoped, make it apparent that the latter district possesses the best-founded claim to the privilege of having received on its bosom the parents of the human race. We are told that a river (or rivers, for the original word has both a singular and a plural signification) 1 went out of 1 Some commentators have considered this word as implying a mass of waters; and one explanation is, ' that a stream or supply of water went from the country of Eden into the garden, where it filled the pools and reservoirs, and thence^went out into other countries in four different directions, forming four rivers.

Whatever doubts may be entertained about the first and Certainty of second streams mentioned in the book of Genesis, there can fomthriveS be little regarding the third, which flows at present, as it did in the time of Moses, towards the east of Ashur, or Assyria, bearing, in the Chaldean language, the name of Hiddekel, Dekel, Dijel, or Diglath, and Tigris, from its well-known swiftness. 1 Still less can there be any uncertainty about the fourth, which was evidently too well known to require more than the brief but expressive sentence, ' and the fourth river is Euphrates.' 2 Presuming the identity of the third and fourth rivers (Tigris and Euphrates) to be sufficiently established, the in quiry is reduced to that of Pison and Gihon; the sources of which, according to scripture, must be sought for in the same region, and there only; since we find it stated that the separation takes place in Paradise itself. At the head of the fertile valleys of the Halys, Aras, Tigris inquiry con- and Euphrates, we find, as might be expected, the highest ETnd 6 mountains which were known for a great many centuries after sec0Tld - the Flood; and in this lofty region are the sources of the four great streams above-mentioned, which flow through Eden in directions tending towards the four cardinal points. The passage in the original is,— dwi rwiivb rrm tisp am» pn-na mp^nb ^ 'inn of which the following has been given as a literal translation: ' And a river (or rivers) went out from Eden, to water the garden : thence it (or they) spread out; that is, had four heads.' Here the words went out must be equivalent to ' rose infor as the gar den was planted in Eden (Gen. ii. 8), the river need not flow out from Eden in order to water it: the words signify to spread, or dissipate, but not divide. The succeeding verses plainly show that there were four distinct rivers corre sponding with the four heads, as their names are given.—MS. of Dr. Aloys Sprenger, M.D. 1 Where it becomes rapid, it takes the name of Tigris, which, in the Median tongue, signifies an arrow.—Pliny, lib.

Armenia well AH can appreciate the advantages of navigable rivers, and the blessings of an abundant supply of water; but those only who have travelled over a blighted wilderness, exposed to the scorching rays of a noon-day sun, tortured with the appre hension of missing the still distant well, can feel in all its force, how much the fitness of any territory to be the abode of man in a state of bliss must depend on the abundance of its waters. It is not, therefore, at all surprising that tradi tion should have assigned, as the site of the earthly paradise, the fertile region watered by the numerous affluents of the Halys, Araxes, Tigris, and Euphrates; especially since this tract, owing to the variety of its surface, climate, and tem perature, is adapted for the growth of almost every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. 1 This also was the seat of what may be considered the second paradise, and the centre of post-diluvian civilization; 2 having been the first portion of the new world which emerged from the deluge; when, after the most awful catastrophe ever connected with the history of mankind, Armenia was peopled for the second time. In describing the countries about the sources of the four rivers, it will be convenient to set out from the Jaghi Tagh or Mountain of Flowers, (so called by the Armenians 'from the great beauty of its valleys,) on whose side, which forms one of the slopes of Ararat, the Murad branch of the Euphrates 3 has its rise. Not far from thence is the plain of Erz-Rum, whose extreme length is about 40 miles, from S.W. to N.E., along the northern branch, and whose greatest breadth is nearly 20 miles, from N.W. to S.E.; its elevation Genesis ii. 9. * This region occupies the country between the Caucasus and Tarabuziin and at one time it was called Ethiopia.-Fallmayer's Geschichte des Byzan- tmischen Kaiserthums, p. 3. y The Arsanias of Pliny, lib.

This region also represents Cappadocia, which, according to Strabo, has a width of 1800 stadia, from Pontus to the Cilician Taurus, and about 3000 stadia in length, from Lycaonia and Phrygia to the Euphrates. 1 He adds, that its mines contain the onyx, the crystal, the celebrated vermilion of Sinope, and a stone resembling ivory; it likewise produces grain, fruits, wine, and cattle of all kinds in abundance. 2 Lake e v' about ^ eastern s ^ e 0 f the Euphrates we find the productive valleys through which runs the Murad branch of that river, besides the splendid scenery of Mush, Bitlis, and the shores of lake Van. 3 The latter are covered with poplar, tamarisk, myrtles, and oleanders, whilst numerous verdant islands scat tered over its placid bosom offer a prospect altogether enchant ing. The country, moreover, enjoys a temperate climate, and its sky is almost always serene. 4 Another traveller, who is more brief, but not less expressive, says, the scenery of lake Van is the most beautiful he has ever seen in Asia; 5 and Mr. Brant designates the gardens in the vicinity as the great charm and boast of Van: in one place they cover an area of seven or eight miles long by four miles broad, with vine yards, orchards, and melon grounds. 6 TigriT 0ftbe Between the Euphrates and lake Van lie the verdant plains of the Tigris: these, except where open spaces are left for the growth of maize, melons, gourds, and cucumbers, are covered 1 Strabo, lib.

At intervals a picturesque cottage appears, like a nest, among the trees; and the silence is occasionally broken by the sounds proceeding from a distant mill. 1 Southward of the eastern extremity of lake V an are the Valleys of valleys of the Zab, the Berdizawi, and those Of the Assyrian Kurdl8tin - Khabur, which are occupied by the long-secluded Christian tribes of the Kaldani, 2 also by the Nestorian Seceders, 3 and the Yezidi; with these the travels of Mr. Ainsworth have just made us acquainted, and there is ground to hope that a beneficial and lasting intercourse will be the result. The adjoining territory of Urumiyah forms the south- District of eastern portion of the supposed limits of paradise; towards Umm,yab ' the extremity of which, and a little way from the southern shores of the lake, is the plain of Solduz. This is a magnifi cent district, having extensive rice grounds, and meadows pasturing at least one thousand mares ; it is likewise covered with herds of buffaloes, cows, sheep, &amp;c., and contains numerous villages, which teem with a prosperous peasantry. 4 The remainder of the district, of which Sa^amast is the western portion, presents one vast extent of groves, orchards, vineyards, gardens, and villages. 5 This description may be partly applied to the country round the flourishing town of Khoi; and, with still greater propriety, to the tract extending its prosperity, along the river Araxes, which, for striking mountain scenery, interspersed with rich valleys, can scarcely be equalled; this district accords, therefore, in every respect, with the best notions we can form of the cradle of the human race. Here, say the Armenians, was the vale of Eden. On the summit of Mount Ararat, at no great distance from hence, the ark rested; and here, also, the vine was first cultivated by Noah, 1 .

He says, that, south west of Erivan, Araxmais, son of Armenac, built a city of hewn stones in the plain of Aragaz, near the left bank of the river called Gihon, whose name was then changed to Arast, or Araxes, after his son.® Genesis ix. 20, 21.

The former, or that part of Asia Minor which lies between the Kizil-Irmak and the western side of the Caucasus, has not been, as yet, perfectly explored; but it is known to produce abundance of the very finest wool, and to be exceedingly rich in different kinds of metals. The mines which existed in ancient times are situated about Tokat, Gumish Khanah, &amp;c., and are still partially worked. 3 With respect to the second tract, the land of Havilah, Havnah, or more correctly, Chavilah, Eeland, 4 after much pains and research, concludes, that it coincides with the Colchis of the ancients. According to Herodotus, 5 this province is bounded on the north by the Phasis; but other writers do not make it reach further in that direction than Ophis. Moses Choronensis calls the province Egeria, and divides it into four districts, viz., Mamalitia, Agrica, Chozia, and Zania, which last is also called Chaldea. 6 It appears that, when the earth was divided in the days inhabited by of Peleg, the sons of Cush directed their course towards this cush 0DS 0 region; and their progress may be traced as they turned westward, at the foot of the Caucasus, advancing along the 1 Cronus, or Ham, reigned in Lydia, and built Byblus, in Phoenicia.— Bishop Cumberland, 'Times of Planting Nations,' London, 1724. 2 Herod, lib.

XII.] ABUNDANCE OF GOLD. 277 Reland seems to have been the first who advanced the opi nion that the land of Havilah was identical with Colchis; 1 Haviiah. but Colchis is, in reality, only a part of Havilah, which was watered by a river of the first order, and included the village ot Haivali, with the district of Chalvata, in Lesser Armenia; so that, in fact, it corresponded nearly with the pashaliks of Sivas and Tarabuzun. The abundance of the precious metals in ancient times, in Gold in Colchis, is indicated by the fable of the golden fleece, and in Colchls * the adjoining territories of Media and Persia, 2 by the account of the golden throne 3 which was presented to the king of Mazanderan after his battle with Kai-Kous, and also by a passage in Herodotus, 4 where it is said that 1000 men had golden pomegranates suspended from their spears, and that 9000 Persians and Medes had the like ornaments in silver. These circumstances show at least that gold and silver were Gold in Asia to be obtained in those parts ; and to this day they are found MlIlor ' occasionally both in Armenia and Asia Minor. Herodotus also states, 5 that the lonians were the richest people in Asia, possessing abundance of gold, silver, copper, and stuffs of various colours. He further mentions, that Xerxes, when passing through the central parts of Asia Minor, received from Pythius, the son of Atys, a present of a plane tree and a vine, both of wrought gold, besides a sum of money equivalent to about three and a half millions sterling; an enormous amount, even without making any allowance for the differ ence in the value of money in ancient and modern times. The precious metals were drawn from the earth by means of forced labour, which, it may be presumed, from the well- 1 Colchis and Havilah are evidently the same name, the monosyllable is heing merely the termination.

We read in Strabo, 3 that Alexander sent Memnon, with a body of troops, to the gold mines which then existed near Cambala in Armenia; and Ibn Haukal, speaking of Haditha (on the Tigris), says, that the river Dijlah runs by the skirts of Mount Barmah, on which are fountains yielding gold dust and bitumen. 4 The amount paid by the different satrapies in gold and silver to Xerxes, 5 must, of itself, establish the fact, that not only in Asiatic Ethiopia, but generally throughout the Assy- nan empire, the precious metals were anciently obtained in great abundance. They might, in all probability, still be found in the same regions; for Malte Brun states, 6 that gold is obtained at Ma'den ; and indications of it were recently met with by Mr. Ainsworth a little way south of that place; 7 from whence, according to Sestini, gold was carried to Con stantinople as late as the year 1781. 8 At this day, the silver mines of Gumish Khanah and Demk, near Jarabuzun, as well as those between Yuz-Kat and Tokat, might be turned to some account. 9 Pliny asserts that the mountains of the Caucasus, 10 and con sequently Colchis, abound with precious metals and stones; a De Virtutibus Mulierum, pp. 262, 263. n W' n 'J'', , ' 1 Lib.

The Emeralds, former writer enumerates twelve kinds of emeralds, the best ot which, he says, are called Scythian, from the region in which they are found. 1 None, he adds, are harder, or have less faults; and these are as much superior to others, as the emerald itself is to other precious stones. 2 Solinus also speaks of this tract as abounding in emeralds of the first quality, and superior to those of Egypt, Media, and even Chalcedon. 3 The stone called schoham is found The Schoham. on the river Thermodon, near Amisius; 4 this is supposed to be the Sapphire of Pliny; 5 who says it is found as far west as Chal cedon, and is also obtained in Media. We have likewise the stone called lapis Armenius, 6 which seems to have been con- founded with lapis lazuli; and another, having the colour of red lead, 7 to which Pliny gives the name of sandyx. 8 Few words have given rise to more discussion than nfrlS in Genesis. 9 Some writers consider it to signify the gum Opinions cou- which is described under that name by Pliny : 10 while others, Bdellium, apparently with greater reason, have referred it to some more precious substance. The learned Reland, for example, thought that schoham, or emerald, was the bdellium of Moses; also Eu- gubinus, and St. Jerome, were of the same opinion: 11 but Bero- aldus, Kimchi, and Benjamin of Tudela, with more probabi lity, have fixed upon the pearl; 12 and it is remarkable that, in the same sentence, the last designates this precious stone by the I Lib.

It may be added, that the gum supposed to be here indicated, as well as turquois, beryls, and the onyx, is found there in a still greater quantity: therefore, whether the Hebrew word really meant a gum, a stone, or a pearl, the locality in question is equally proper, since they are all to be found there.

On the Nahr Malcha, a little way north of Babel are the Ruins of ruins of the Kush of Abu-l-feda ; 2 a name which seems to be Kush ' quite as ancient as the former city, and from whence and its neighbourhood the inhabitants were transported by Shalma- nazar to Samaria. 3 The word Chus remains almost unchanged in Kush, Shus, Names derived Sus, and Kushasdan, the Land of the Sun, and the Land 0 f fromChus - the Magi. 4 It is also repeatedly mentioned in close connexion with the territory lying northward and north-eastward of Baby lonia. The Jews are to be called from Assyria, from Cush, from Elam, and from Shinar. 5 Again, Elam and his brother Ashur were tributaries of Chus, whose descendants occupied the country of the Hindi, the Paracani, and the Ethiopians, 6 the Asia of Moses Choronensis. This people were indifferently called by other nations Cushan, 7 Cuseans, Erythreans, Oritse, &amp;c.: and some of them passed into Africa under the name of the Hycsos, led by their enterprising chief Saites, 8 bearing still their original designation of Ethiopians. That Asiatic Cush has been rightly placed in the territory Asiatic Cush adjoining Colchis, seems tolerably clear from some of the old near Colchls - writers.

The mounds, tombs, coins, and ancient inscriptions of Asia Minor furnish the antiquarian with a link which seems to connect the earliest works of art belonging to Fran with those of Europe; and specimens of the former, together with some remains of the written language of Assyria, are to be found beneath as well as above the surface, accompanied by the ruins of edifices, which were executed by the Greeks and Romans when they occupied this part of the Asiatic continent. Asia Minor has been the scene of a series of great events, which may be traced back from the labours of the Apostles, to the wars of Mithridates against the Romans, to the dazzling times of Alexander and Xerxes, and even to the heroic age 2 o 2284 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. [CHAP. XIII. itself, on which a new light has been cast in consequence of the discoveries recently made towards the south-western side. Se r i V o a rd 0 Asil The name Asia ' according to some learned critics, belongs to a very remote period, and different geographical interpreta tions of the word have been given, among which are an ele vated or a primitive country, and one on which the sun does not set. It is not, however, easy to imagine that a very ancient people would have given a general designation to the whole of this great continent; and it is more probable that the name belongs to a comparatively late period: it is supposed that, in the first instance, the name was applied to the country nearest Greece, from whence it extended to the Halys, and from thence gradually further eastward, till the whole tract from the shores of the Mediterranean to Behring's Straits was so called. S mSL The P eninsu la of Lesser Asia extends northward from the Sea of Cyprus to the shores of the Black Sea, and eastward from the shores of the Mediterranean to the banks of the Euphrates; its breadth in the former direction being about 360 miles, and its length nearly 600 miles, it has the shape of an irregular parallelogram, which, exclusive of Cyprus and the other islands, contains 151,699 square geographical miles ous'character. ^ a ? eneral wa y ^ diversified country may be described as a wide spreading table-land sloping westward of the Euphrates, and gradually sinking below the level of the pla teau of I'rdn, of which, however, it may be said to form the continuation: in fertility, and in some other particulars, Asiatic Turkey differs from the Persian territory, though many of the leading features in both are precisely alike. The interior of the former contains many sheets of water of ffreat magnitude, but for the most part it consists of a succession o. ^tensive plains not unfrequently furrowed by deep valleys either separated from each other by lofty chains, or com pletely inclosed by them, becoming, in the latter case, so many remarkable mountain basins. The limits of the extensive upland containing these plains and basins are marked by an elevated and almost continuous chain, around which, at a lower evel, a succession of narrow plains border the shores of the editerranean and Black Seas; the culminating points of theCHAP.

The different directions of these numerous chains were, till recently, almost unknown; but in the journeys made by myself, and subse quently by other travellers, they have been followed at inter vals in many different places, and therefore a general descrip tion of them may now be given with a considerable degree of accuracy. The most remarkable peaks appear to be in the prolongation The Anti- of the range which, at p. 68, has been already followed to the Tauru8 ' north-eastern extremity of the territory. This chain is desig nated the Anti-Taurus by Strabo, 1 who also seems to have included under this name the mountains of the Moschi and their continuation along the western shores of the Caspian. 2 But as the writer elsewhere speaks of the source of the Euphrates as being on the northern side of the Taurus, 3 it is evident that he then applies the name to the chain northward of Erz-Rum. We find, moreover, that even the Caucasus itself was so called in the days of Pliny ; 4 and as it included Armenia, Media, &amp;c., within its branches, 5 it may be inferred that Anti-Taurus had a local, and Taurus a more general application, particularly as the width of 3000 stadia 6 (in many places) nearly agrees with the space between the Cilician Taurus and the northern abutments of the Western plateau of that mountain. In branching from the Caucasus this last chain skirts the'andUs^ eastern side of Imiretia, and afterwards, under the name of the Perengah Tagh, it runs nearly south-west along the deep valley of Ajirah, in the district of Tchildir, from whence it turns southward and again westward along the valley of the Acampsis, westward of which, bearing the name of the Kop Tagh, it enters Lesser Asia. 1 Lib.

Occasionally the elevation approaches 5500 feet, 1 and the Taurw; acclivities are so steep that but little corn is cultivated on it. Portions of the westward slopes are clothed with chestnut, beech, walnut, alder, and poplar of large growth; whilst, on the opposite side, the vegetation is more scanty, and the bare hills are interspersed with tracts of pine forest, or small oaks mixed with Scotch or spruce fir, and some few beeches or alders. 8 From the left bank of the lower Jorak the chain runs south-westward as far as the deep valley of Gfimish Khanah, along which it sends branches to Tarabuzun. I t is chiefly a limestone formation, with volcanic rocks and some granite. It has nearly the same elevation as the preceding part of the chain; and, like that part, is remarkable for a suc cession of wild and rocky ravines, with streams flowing down its slopes on each side, the slopes towards the Black Sea being, m many places, covered with an underwood of arbutus rhododendron, rose bushes, and wild vines. Near the silver mines, a little southward of the town alluded to, the prin cipal range makes a western sweep almost in a direction parallel to the coast, and so continues by the town of Niksar (Ne^Csesarea) and onward to the valley of the Char-Sham- bab Su, from whence, under the name of Ak Tagh and the layshan fagh it preserves nearly a westerly direction as far as the banks of the Halys in the neighbourhood of Osmaniik A limestone formation prevails throughout this wooded range which, although grand and marked throughout its course is more particulariy so in the neighbourhood of Gnmish Khanah and Niksar.

To the northward an inferior chain runs parallel to the An inferior Black Sea; its slopes are covered with timber, and have inBiacksea.^ many places a rich underwood of vines, myrtle, arbutus, &amp;c., interspersed with fruit trees, hemp, and other productions; and southward are other branches, two of which separate for a time as they diverge from the principal range southward of Niksar. The more northern of these, under the names of the Ferahad Tagh, and the Arzlin Tagh, runs westward between the valley of Amasiyah and the vale of Tirkali; whilst the southern, called the Aklo Tagh, 1 separates the latter from that of Tokat, and sweeps westward round the sources of the Iris to Zileh. From hence it runs northward, and having joined the other arm near Amasiyah, it takes a western direc tion, and finally connects itself with the Kirk Delim and Koseh Tagh, ranges which border the Halys beyond Osmanjik. The former range rises to 3090 feet, and contains several small sepulchral grots, in addition to a remarkable colossal monu ment resembling the Tombs of the Kings at Amasiyah f and the latter forms its prolongation till it joins the Tavshan Taghi, or Hare Mountains, which are of sandstone and limestone, rising to 3690 feet near the borders of the Halys. 3 On the western other^ side of this river the range is renewed in a westerly direction, and it soon after shows the rugged peaks of the Alkas Tagh or Olgassys, in which are numerous fossils, in addition to mines of salt and orpiment. 4 From this chain are sent out, in the direction of Kastamuni, the Ilik Tagh, and Yeralah Goz Tagh; and again, northward of that place, into the Baldr Kureh-si or copper district, the groups of Kizil Kara Taghi, and Bakir Sultan.

The latter is the commencement of the Bithynian Olympus, which, like that of Paphlagonia, is chiefly of limestone, and covered with timber; its successive groups carry the line westward along the borders of Bithynia to the banks of the Sakariyah or Sangarius, and from thence, under the name of the Kudje Tagh or Demir ji range, into Mysia. This great arm is, as will be presently seen, connected on one side by the Murad Tagh with the Southern Taurus, whilst on the other it sends out the celebrated branch of Ida, and other offsets, towards the shores of the Propontis; the highest and most remarkable being that which takes a north-west direction, along the southern side of the Bithynian capital. Splendid oriental planes shade the houses and walks at the foot of Mount Olym pus, and the sides of the latter present groves of large chest nut and walnut trees, which, in ascending the mountain, are succeeded by the oak, fir, spruce, and near its bare crest, the juniper; this crest, at an elevation of nearly 5000 feet, over looks the city of Brusa and the rich mulberry plantations of the surrounding plain. The northern side of the plain is shut in by spurs and offset branches from the main chain, whose sides, clothed with myrtle, broom, heath, the Valonia oak, 1 and a profusion of arbutus, are reflected from numerous fresh lakes, and the picturesque inlets of the Sea of Marmora. interior chains. Reverting to the chains which intersect the interior. From the north-eastern extremity of the territory, double lines of groups take a diagonal direction, and, as they advance, partly inclose the head valleys of the Frat, the Lycus, the Halys, and the Melas. The more northern of the two branches forms an acute angle with the Pontic chain as it diverges from it in a south-westerty direction, passing along the Sheitan Dereh-si (Devil s Valley) and the plain of Lorl to the town of Gemeri, 1 Quercus Aegilops.CHAP.

From thence it con tinues in the same direction to Kara Hisar, previously show ing, towards the east, the elevated Almali Tagh and the high ground near U'leh-Sheivan, with the lofty and remarkable mountain of Gaur Tagh rising above it on the north. The range is chiefly of limestone, bearing the barberry and Description of rose-bush, near the half sunken villages of the Armenian and bra«c 0 h. them Kurdish population, and its sides are covered with pine forests almost to Kara Hisar. Here, however, naked masses of red sandstone mark the seat of the extensive alum mines of Shebb- Khaneh, and likewise connect the mountains on the northern side of the valley of the Yechil-Irmak (Green River) and the plain of Akshar with those forming the limits of both to the south. The former range, under the name of Tekeli Tagh, sweeps westward of Kara Hisar, where, being designated Gemi-beli (ship peak), and subsequently Koseh Tagh (Mount Thin Beard), it bounds the wide table-land as far as a point 20 miles north of Sivas, where it separates. One branch, called the Ak or Akajik Tagh, continues along the plain of Kaisariyeh till it meets the north-western offsets from Arjish Tagh, and it consists of groups of hills less or more continu ous, occasionally showing Armenian or Turkoman villages on its wooded sides. The other and more considerable branch has nearly a western direction, first showing the lofty and remarkable peak called Yulduz Tagh (Star Mountain) and the limestone chain of Chamlu Bel, 1 sloping into the valley of The ciiamiu Tokat from a height of 5260 feet, and having, as the name e ' indicates, its sides covered with pine forests. 2 The groups southward of the plains of Sivas and Kaisariyeh are bolder and more numerous than those lying to the north ward, which have just been followed. Towards the eastern side is the Kara-Bel, which, from the and Kara-Bel, point of junction with the Tekeli Tagh, skirts the table-land of Sivas and the southern side of the plain of Kaisariyeh ; and a little way down its slopes, southward of the former town, is Yarbassan, which is the Yailah or winter habitation of an 1 Scydisses of Strabo, lib, XL, p. 419. 1 Ainsworth's Assyria and Babylonia, p. 288.

The chain is composed of serpen- tines, gypsum, and sandstone; and it rises to the height of 5790 feet, having on its wooded sides the springs 1 of the eastern branch of the Halys. With the exception of an open ing about midway between Sivas and Kaisariyeh, which leads to Gurun, the range is nearly continuous, wooded, and pre serves a considerable elevation till the culminating point of Arjish Tagh rises from its vast volcanic bed to the height of 12,809 feet. 2 Mount Arjish may be considered the centre from which a succession of volcanic groups spread in different directions. One chain takes a north-westerly direction, along the eastern side of the Halys, till at length it joins the mountains of Angora beyond that river. Its principal peaks are the Aka-juk Tagh, Haji-Bektash Tagh, rising to 3780 feet, Khirkah Tagh, 3095 feet, Karvanserai Tagh, Baranli Tagh, Boz-uk Tagh, ^ara Goz Tagh, 4180 feet, Begrek Taghi, and Denek tagh,' in which are the mines of the same name, at an elevation of 3340 feet above the sea. 3 Limestone and sienite prevail in these groups, which generally inclose plains, and they are usually wooded. 4 The districts of Kaisariyeh and Ak-Serai' are more rugged, and peculiarly marked by their wild and stony ravines, inter spersed with some productive plains and fertile declivities. 5 The action of volcanic matter in those districts may be traced by the groups of Akajik Tagh, Kojah Tagh, and Sari- bulak Tagh (granite), which skirt the eastern side of the lake; also by the loftier peaks to the southward of Hasan Tagh and Karajah Tagh ; here the upland of lava has been rent into deep and narrow secluded glens, studded with pinnacles and rocky precipices; but on the western side of the geat salt lake (Tuz Goli) the operations of nature are less strongly marked.

In this direction also are the groups of Bor 6 and Kiz-hisar, with the conical mass of Hasan Tagh to the north-west, rising to the height of 8000 feet; and again, south-westward of this mountain, a succession of vol canic excavated rocks prolongs the line through the dark and stony district of Kara Bunar to the Taurus. 7 A little distance southward of the Kara-Bel is the lofty limestone range of Dumbu Tagh, abounding in native iron, terminating in the latter direction with the deep valley in which Divrigi and the range of Erumbat Tagh, overhanging it on the southern side, are situated. The eastern extremity of the valley thus formed is shut in by high rocky precipices; and, at some little distance westward, running nearly in the prolongation of the valley, are the snow-clad summits of Yamur Tagh. Again, more southward, and parallel to the preceding chain, is the extensive range of Sari-chi-chak (highest peak), with the Akjah Tagh near its southern slopes; the volcanic groups of Arab Groups near Baba, Gol Tagh, and Arab-Kir, occupy, at intervals, the Aral&gt;Kir ' rest of the space, as far as the spot where the Dujik Tagh is broken by the river Euphrates, which here sweeps round the rocks of Munshar : 8 from hence fir-clad limestone groups prolong the line in a south-westerly direction to the valley 1 Mr. W.

This singular town is in the heart of the moun tains, and occupies a central point from whence three great arms may be followed in different directions. One of these is marked by a double line of groups running north-westward to the prolongation of the Kara-Bel at the plain of Kaisariyeh ; and its principal peaks are the Kara Tunus Tagh Yel Gadu- gi, the Sarichik Tagh (Yellowish Mountain), the Shemah Tagh (Mount Flambeau), the Teger Tagh, the Viran Shehr Tagh, and the Khanzir Tagh; which are composed of lime stone and gypsum, rising at the highest point to about 5400 feet. 1 - Again, on the opposite side of Gurun, the valley of the Tokhmah-su is bounded by an almost continuous chain, formed by the groups of Bel-li-Gedik Tagh, rising to 5625 feet, 2 and those of the Akjah Tagh, which are connected with the slopes of Taurus proper, a little way southward of Malatiyah. The third, or remaining branch, which is alpine and picturesque, diverges almost at a right angle, or south-west from the valley of the Tokhmah-su, and it incloses the Tashli Gokcheh, the Kara Bunar, and the Abasil-li valleys in addition to two extensive plains. The first of these is surrounded by the groups of the Yel Gadugi, the Gok dil-li arid a part of the Ali Tagh ranges ; and the second, called the Ova al Bostan, lies between the flat and lofty limestone ridges of Casterman, Jebel Sersaf and Kusher Tagh. Towards its northern termination, with an elevation' probably exceeding 7000 feet, the chain separates the head waters of the Saihun and Jaiihan, whilst the opposite, and, perhaps, higher extremity is lost m the southern Taurus. The sides of this extensive chain are clothed with the largest timber, chiefly pines- whilst the fissures and ravines have an underwood of arbutus' myrtle, rose, and other shrubs.

It now remains to notice the southern abutments of the Taurus proper: plateau, by continuing the description of the range denomi nated Taurus proper, from the borders of the territory to which it has already been followed. 1 From the banks of the Euphrates, near Gergen Kal'eh-si, the chain takes a west- south-westerly direction through the pashalik of Mar'ash, showing the elevated limestone summits of Ura Baba, Ashur Tagh, Nurhak Tagh, Kanlu Tagh, Najar Tagh, Tojik Tagh, Ak Tagh, and Ali-Sh6hr Tagh. The last is a little way northward of the capital, and it is called Gouger-houad by the Armenians; 2 from which neighbourhood the Amanus branch quits the southern, and, as has just been seen, the Anti-Taurus quits its northern slopes. Thus far the Taurus occasionally presents bare and steep acclivities, but in general it is thickly wooded, and singularly marked by the extraordinary depth of its valleys, which are thickly clothed with a variety of shrubs, and, not unfre- quently, quite shut in by stupendous precipices. A few miles westward of Mar'ash a change takes place, its description . ij 'i i r we8 ^ war( i and the chain presents three distinct naked ridges, each 01 Mar'ash. which is composed of masses of rock with conical summits, having nearly equal elevations: since snow remains on the ridges throughout the summer, that elevation must be con siderable ; and it increases on approaching the Pylse Cilicise, where it is about 13,000 feet. The vast masses of limestone, of which the chain is almost entirely composed, are usually separated by wild and deep parallel ravines, which are either shut in by steep wooded acclivities, or vertical precipices, through which passages are effected at intervals, but with much difficulty. The scenery, though far superior, may, in some respects, be compared to that of the Tyrol; and the paths being carried some hundreds of feet above the foot of 1 See above, p. 10. a Mem., &amp;c., par St. Martin, Vol. I., p. 181.294 BRANCHES FROM THE TAURUS.

The chain of Taurus proper afterwards decreases in heio-ht and runs in a S.W. direction between the districts K6niyeh and 1 ch-ili, as far as the pass of Laranda, beyond which it is divided into two great branches. One of these, preserv ing the name of Taurus, continues in a westerly direction, or nearly parallel to the coast, sending out, besides those numerous offsets which caused the name of Trachea to be r f , g lv en to Western Cilicia, the Solyman Tagh, with other the interior. ^aUC CS, southwards into Lycia and Caria.

N.W. through the mountains, and subsequently through the plains of Niksar and Tashova, where it takes the name of the Char-shambah-su. In the plain near Boghaz Kissan Kal'eh, this river, the ancient Lycus, is joined by the western branch, or Iris, which is called the Tokat su. The latter has its springs on the southern slopes of the great chain, at some little distance to the S.W. of the town of Niksar; and, after running in this direction through the vale of Tokat, it takes a western course along the Kaas Ova to the village of Karevli, from whence it sweeps northward to Tourkhal, where it again runs westward, through a valley and along the south side of Alti Aghaj Tagh, into the plain of Amasiyah. On entering the latter, it is joined by an affluent coming from the south, and soon afterwards it receives a considerable, river, which is formed by two branches. The southern and more considerable of these is at first known by the name of the Alajah Chai', whose several springs unite southward of Churum, and the trunk thus formed, bearing the name of Tchoterlek Irmak, runs westward, and again north-eastward, is joined by the into the valley of Amasiyah; just short of which the northern irLikf e branch comes into it, by an easterly course, from the slopes of the Kirk Delim mountains in the vicinity of Churum. This branch now seems to have nearly an E.N.E. course till it joins the Yeshil-Irmak, or Green River, at the spot already mentioned; just afterwards it receives another affluent coming from the westward, in the neighbourhood of Boghaz Keui-Ghieul, or Stephane Palus. 1 After these accessions to its waters, the Yeshil-Irmak, or Char-shambah-su, appears to take a northerly direction, till, under the former name, it enters the Black Sea about 10 miles eastward of and enters the , Black Sea.

The western and principal arm appears to have two sources in Lycaonia, which, after uniting near Sevri-Hisar,- takes a N.N.E. course through the wide and flat plain 1 ' in which it meets the eastern branch. The latter is formed by several streams, one of which, the Angora su, has two branches, viz. the Tabanli Chai and Chibuk 'su, both of which rise to the eastward, and unite below, or a little westward of that place. And in a wild and rocky valley, at some distance in the latter direction, the trunk is joined'by the Tcher su, which comes from the Murtah Ovah-si, nearly 25 miles north of the city, 2 and flows through a similar country. After a tortuous course of about 20 miles W. S. W. through a country of gypsum, the trunk formed by the Angora river and the Tcher su, enters into defiles of granite, and then falls into the Sakariyah, or western arm.

The Mseander now inclines a little more westward, and is increased by the Kara su (Mosynus), the Arpah su, the Cheena Chai' (Marsyas), and many inferior tributaries, as it makes a tortuous course between Lydia and Caria, till it enters the Mediterranean nearly opposite Patmos. On the south-western side of the peninsula are the copious streams watering the plains of Cilicia, two of which have their most distant sources in the Anti-Taurus, northward of A1 Bostan, and subsequently traverse the whole width of the Taurus from north to south in a remarkable manner: again, farther west, the high ground north of Golek Boghaz separates the western branch of the ancient Sarus from the principal source of a third stream, the river of Tarsus. The latter is the celebrated Cydnus, which, under the Rise and name of the Mezarluk Chai, has its rise in the heart of the cydnus. great chain, and on the southern slope of the elevated ground in question; from whence it flows by Golek Boghaz, winding S.S. eastward through the pass, and along the plain in the same general direction, receiving in this part of its course, but more particularly on the western side, several affluents coming from the southern slopes of the Taurus. A short distance from Tarsus the Cydnus breaks over, and partly through a ledge of brecciated rocks, with a fall of about 18 feet, resembling that of SchafFhausen in miniature; it is, however, more picturesque, since it forms several wooded islands as it approaches the town. A little southward of the city it receives a considerable feeder from the north, and taking nearly the direction of the latter, the trunk has a south-westerly course through the alluvial plain to the shores of the Mediterranean.

Scarcely two miles eastward from the termination of the Springs cfrt* Cydnus is the estuary of the river Saihun, whose trunk is formed by the meeting of two great branches almost in the heart of the Taurus. The eastern and more distant of these has one of its springs at Cheralik, on the sides of the Yel Gadugi range, some miles southward of Gurun; 1 and another more westward in the mountains, near Viran Shehr, from whence the stream flows southward by Tomarse and Jemnick to the supposed point of junction below Farashak. 2 The main eastern stream has not been followed, but its windings through the Anti-Taurus and along part of the Taurus can scarcely give less than 150 miles distance before it reaches the western branch. The latter, under the name of Kar- mushlu-su, has its source near Bulderun Khan, 3 from whence it flows south-westward for nearly 30 miles along the Ailah Tagh, receiving midway an affluent coming from the slopes of the Uch Kapu Tagh, southward of Nigdeh. Being turned by the Kizil Tagh, the river makes a bold sweep south-east ward, along the north-eastern side of this mountain; at the extremity of which it falls into the main branch, previously receiving the Bozanlti-su. This considerable affluent is formed by the union of many streams on the northern slopes of the Bulghar Tagh, of which the Kara Gechid-su is the principal. This last comes from the slopes of Armud Beli Tagh, from whence it sweeps westward and southward through the ruins of Faustinopolis ; and leaving these it flows fe.b.K to the hot springs and ruins near Takhta Kopri. Here, having received from the west two large affluents, the trunk lorces a passage in the previous direction through the Bulghar ^agh to Ak K6pri and the ruins of Padandus • from which, bearing the name of the Bozanlfi-srt, it passes along the southern side of the Kizil Tagh into the Kar- mushlu-su ; and the united waters fall into the eastern Mr. Ainsworth's Journey from Kaisariyah : Vol. X.

Near the village of Jakli Guba, a considerable stream, the Mamish Chai, comes into it from the north; and, after this accession to its waters, the trunk of the Saihun scoops a valley bed first southward, and then south-westward, through the plain, to Adana, where it has a width of 1050 feet; its course from thence continues as before for upwards of 30 miles through the rich alluvion of Campestris to the estuary already noticed. The next river, the Jaihan, has a still longer course, and. Branches of like the preceding, it has two principal branches. One of these flows from the Anti-Taurus westward to A1 Bostan ; from whence, after being joined by two affluents from the north, it continues in the previous direction for about eight miles. Here it is joined by another tributary, which in coming from the slopes of the Bel-li Gedik range 2 gives to it a southerly direction ; and a little onward it is joined by a more considerable stream from the west. The latter has two branches: the northern, the Goksun-su, after an eastern course of about 30 miles, receives the Tengin Dereh-su from the S.W., just before it falls into the Jaihan. This last now takes a southerly direction, receiving, as it flows onward, the Nargileh Suyu from the'east; again, the Ternis-su from the west; and finally carrying a considerable body of water through the deep and wooded valleys of Taurus proper, till at a spot about nine miles S.

From thence it flows N.W. through Shehr Ovah, 1 in which it is joined by two or three affluents from the high ground to the south, and finally enters the main stream in the valley of Aghr Tagh. From the neighbourhood of Mar'ash the trunk of the ancient Pyramus runs W. S.W. and sweeps round the mountains of Anabad into the deep valley separating the Durdun Tagh range from the Taurus : along the latter it preserves the same general direction through forests of pine, broken by deep ravines and stupendous rocky precipices, till at length it enters the plain of Cilicia, in which it receives the Kaisha-su and another stream from the slopes of the -Taurus : and again, near Am-zarbah it is joined by two affluents. One of these, the Salakat, or Saurtin Chai, makes a bold sweep, first south-westward from Kars, then north westward, and, finally, southward, in which direction it passes the town and castle of Am-zarbah. About four miles om the latter place it unites with the eastern branch; and again, at the same distance southward, the trunk is entered by a great branch from the north. This fine river, which also bears the name of the Jaihan, has its springs in the Anti-laurus, from whence it winds through the recesses ot laurus proper, at some distance westward of the town of bis, and of a castle which has the designation of Kara Sis. In this part of its course it is joined by so many considerable streams, that it is navigated by rafts some time before it reaches the plain, along which it passes a little westward ot Am-zarbah, and pursues its southern course to the point of junction already noticed. The trunk formed by these different branches appears to make a gentle sweep westward of south to Misis (the ancient Mopsuesta), where it has a and ^ &amp;C - ^ ^ Ai — N °^CHAP.

After a course of about nine miles to the S.W., and being joined by an affluent coming from the north, the Jaihan or river of the World sweeps southward, and again eastward, passing through marshes into the sea at the southern extremity of the Bay of Ayas, where it has already deposited a considerable tract of alluvial soil. 1 1 According to the prediction of an ancient oracle, the soil deposited by the Pyramus will in time extend the coast of Cilicia till it joins that of Cyprus.

In addition to the affluents of these two abundant Slvas district, rivers, the greater part of the territory is watered by the two principal branches of the Char-Shambah, which have already been noticed. The extensive pashalik of Sivas has Mount Taurus towards the north; the Anti-Taurus traverses its centre from S.E. to N.W. ; and an offset of the latter, which runs northward of Mount Arjish, skirts the eastern side of the Halys. These ranges give to the district of Slvas a very diversified surface, which is now chiefly occupied by the flocks of the Kurds and Turkomans; although, in general, like the fertile Gadolinitis at its north-western extremity, 1 it is admirably adapted for the most productive cultivation. In the latter portion of the province is Bafra, a town with Towns of Bafra, two mosques, a fine bridge, and about 700 houses on the right bank, at about 10 miles from the estuary of the Halys ; and towards the interior is Vezir Kopri (formerly the Kedi Kal'ah, or Ghedakara 2 of the Turks), a town containing about 1070 houses. 3 Lastly, we have 'Osmanjik, the ancient 'Osmanjik, Otressa, a bustling post town of about 300 houses, with a proportion of khans and mosques, and a noble bridge of 13 arches over the Halys ; besides a castle, which, from the summit of an isolated rock, commands a view of the whole. 4 A little way southward of this early station of the Osmanli conquerors is Churum, a town having a castle, 16 mosques, and churum. several khans and baths, and nearly 2000 houses. It is now governed by an A'yan, under whom are also the towns of Saz, Haji-Hamzah, Iskelib, Kasar, and 'Osmanjik. About 22 miles eastward of the latter is the district of Merzivan, which contains mines of silver, copper, and salt; also a town of the same name, with about 15,000 inhabitants, under a Vaivodeh. Again, eastward of Amasiyah, is its remaining dependency, the town of Niksar (Neocsesarea), which has a castle and 1 Strabo, lib.

The deep and extensive valley of the city of Strabo 3 is further remarkable from its picturesque character, and from containing an elevated citadel, beneath which the singular and almost inaccessible tombs of the kings of Pontus have been excavated in the face of the rock. Amasiyah is under a Musellim, who pays a fixed sum from the products of the district; and the average crop of silk collected is about 66,000 lbs. 4 There are two other dependencies of the jtashalik in this Towns of direction, Tokat and Zileh. The latter contains 2000 houses on a rising ground, whose summit is occupied by a fortress.

Yuz-Kat is governed by a Musellim, and although decayed, it still contains nearly 4000 houses; it is situated in a valley, and has several mosques, one of which was built after the plan of St. Sophia at Constantinople. On the borders of the Halys, at some distance westward of Kir-shehr. Yuz-Kat, is the Turkoman district of Kir-shehr, which con tains the fertile plain of Sogher; and, northward of the latter, the Sanjak of Denek Ma'den. 4 To the south are the A'yanliks of Haji-Bektash and Mujur; the town bearing the latter name contains 600 houses; and nearly in the centre of the whole is a valley, in which stands Kir-shehr, the capital, a town of about 4000 inhabitants. Owing to the religious fanaticism of the Dervishes this place presents the contrast of wretched houses going to decay amidst gardens of remarkable fertility. 5 Although eastward of the Halys, the district is now under the Pasha of Angora. Near the eastern side of the territory is the Musellimik Town of of Divrigi, with the mines of Siliski in the neighbourhood. The former town, the Tephrene of the Lower Empire, 6 con tains about 2000 houses, situated amidst gardens in a fertile valley, shut in to the north by the Dumbu Tagh, on which is the castle ; and by the Erumbat Tagh to the south.

The former contains an ancient castle, and 1000 Armenian and Turkish houses, situated amidst gardens, at the meeting of two deep and picturesque valleys. The latter place contains two mosques, numerous gardens, and a singular castle, occupying a high rock, which overlooks a precipitous pass along the banks of the Tokhmah-su. 3 City of Sivas. The extensive city of Sivas, or Suas, 4 is built on one of the affluents of the Kizil-Irmak, nearly in the centre of an extensive plain which stretches E.N.E. and W.S.W. It contains two castles, each placed on a hill, also 1000 Arme nian and nearly 5000 Turkish houses, partly tiled and partly flat-roofed, which, are intermingled with gardens, baths, khans, medresses, and mosques. Of the last there are nearly one hundred, which, being in the best style of Arabian or Persian architecture, are striking edifices; their minarehs and entrances are particularly elegant. The bazars are well supplied, and there is a considerable transit trade by the routes proceeding from the city.

Eastward from Tarabuzun are the districts of You- mirah, Surmenah, Of, Riza, and Lazistan ; all of which, with the exception of that of Of, are known under the general name of Lazistan, from Lazii, the name of the people. It contains the small ports of Khotz, Solocler, Riza, Eski, Townof Tarabuzun, Kopa, Makral, and the mouths of the Makala • amsun ' and Kendris rivers. 1 Some distance westward of the capital is the Kera-shundereh su, on which was ancient Cerasus; 2 and farther along the coast are the small towns and ports of Terabolis (Tripoli), Kerasun, the ancient Pharnacia; 3 also Ordou, Fatsa, Unieh (Oenoe), the estuary of the Yeshil-'Irmak, which terminates below the town of Char-shambah, amidst groves of fruit trees; and, finally, the ancient Amisus, now Samsun, nine miles westward of the river. The latter town is under a Musellim, and it contains about 450 Mussulman houses. At the eastern extremity there is a castle, and at the western are the government buildings, containing the copper, lead, &amp;c., brought hither for shipment. The anchorage is open but safe, 4 and a road was in consequence made from hence to the interior, through Sivas, by the late Reshid Muhammed Pasha in 1835.

The houses of the former portion rise one above the other on the steep sides of the hills enclosing this part of the valley; and they are remarkable for being covered with sloping roofs of shingles. The mines still worked are in this quarter, but the neglected district abounds in copper, lead, and silver. Nearly two miles from hence is the remainder of the town, situated at the meet ing of the cross valley, by which, in all probability, the Greeks entered that of Gumish Khanah from the south-west Vmzfin 0f ^ ara ' r ^ e capital of the pashalik occupies the lower slope of the chain which rises abruptly from the shores of the Black Sea; and the city having a back-ground of richly-wooded pic turesque mountains, the view is particularly striking, whether seen from the land or the sea. The most ancient part of the city, the probable site of Trapezus, is an elevated plateau, forming a rectangular tongue of land, extending about 800 yards from north to south, and 250 from east to west; it is fortified with walls, and square or hexagonal towers, and at the southern extremity is the castle, a more elevated building, which serves as a citadel for this portion of the town. Deep valleys covered with trees are on the eastern and western sides of the plateau, and over each is a bridge leading to the houses and gardens of the suburbs, which extend northwards to the sea; the bridges lead also to a second parallelogram about 900 yards long and 800 yards wide, which partly encloses the first, and is fortified in a similar manner : it is on rather a lower level, and lies on its northern side. The walls and towers were probably con structed by the Genoese when they had possession of the place ; and the remains of the ancient mole may still be seen running into the sea. &lt;s roadstead.

The city is believed to have been founded about 2000 years b.c. 1 The 16 Sanjakliks composing the Vezirate of Anadoli Ancient pro- proper, include the whole tract northward of the district ofZZu. IConiyeh, and westward, from the limits of the preceding districts on the banks of the Halys, to the shores of the Black and Mediterranean Seas ; so that they nearly represent the Asiatic proconsulate of the Romans, viz. Lydia, Ionia, Caria, Mysia, Phrygia, and the district of the Hellespont; 2 they also constitute the Asia proper of Ptolemy 3 and Strabo; that is, the whole of the territory within the Halys, with the excep tions of Pisidia, Pamphylia, and a part of Phrygia. In describing the former portion, it will be proper to A'yiiniik of commence with the A'yanlik of Aidin, which occupies the Aldm ' interior, stretching from the lower part of the Mendereh northward by Tireh to the river Kodus or Geduz, and east ward along the former river, till it includes Aidin, Sart, Guzel-hisar, Allah-shehr, and the principal town, Tireh. This fine tract, which is mentioned by Homer, 4 contains Soghiah. the governments of Soghiah and Saru-Khan, of which the former has the district of Ai'din to the east: it extends along the shores of Ionia, from the banks of the Buyuk Mendereh to those of the Kodus, and is remarkable for the bold and striking scenery formed by its numerous headlands, bays, and inlets, especially that of the chief town, Izmir, Saru-Khan touches the northern extremity of Soghiah Sam-Khan, and Ai'din, and consists of a narrow strip, which extends eastward from the Gulf of Sandarli to the plains beyond Ak-hisar, With the exception of the Kiziljah, Musa Tagh (Mount Tmolus), and the range of Boz Tagh (Mount Sipylus) to the north, it is almost entirely a rich plain, which is abundantly watered by the Kodus and Mendereh, with their tributaries : near the rivers are seen the fig, vine, olive, plane, pine, wild pear, and oleander; but the country is thinly 1 Falmayer's Geschichle des Byzantinisclien Kaiserthums, p. 4. 2 Notit.

It contains the town of Durghut-li Kasabah (commonly called Kasabah), 1 which consists of nearly 2000 houses ; 8 and Manser, or Manisa (Magnesia), the capital. The latter is a modern city, stand ing at the foot of Mount Sipylus, near the southern bank of the Kodus, and containing a population of about 25,000 souls: the town is in a thriving condition, having many mosques, khans, &amp;c.; and it equals, if not surpasses, Smyrna in its public buildings. Including the interesting coast of Ionia, Lydia proper had the iEgean Sea on the west, Phrygia on the east, Mysia on the north, and Caria on the south. 3 The three branches of Ak Tagh 4 towards the southern limits, Musa Tagh 5 in the centre, and a branch of the latter, with Mount Sipylus near the northern extremity, traverse the territory from east to west: these branches form the limits of the Mseonian plains, as well as of the rich and well watered The Hermus or valleys lying along the Hermus. This river, the Kodus of the Turks, is formed by three principal affluents, the most northern of which, the Demirji-chai, or ancient Hyllus, rises in Phrygia, and flows south-westward from the slopes of the Demirji range to the borders of Lydia, where it is joined by the united waters of the Ghiediz-chai and Ameh-chai. The former of these, which appears to represent the Hermus, 6 flows south-westward from the slopes of Morad Tagh, and again W. N.W. into the Demirji-chai, receiving just pre viously the Aineh-chai, which at first has a southerly course from the Demirji Tagh, and afterwards flows westward from Selenti. The trunk thus formed, which represents both the Hyllus and Hermus, flows S.W. through the Katakekaumene to Adala, beyond which it receives, from the E.S.E., the Allah Shehr, or Cogamus river, and afterwards the Pactolus, which is formed by several small affluents on the southern side of Sart. The Hermus flows westward from thence to 1 The Rev. R. G. Renouard. 8 The Rev. F. V. Arundell's Discoveries in Asia Minor, Vol. I., p. 21. 3 Pliny, lib. V., c. xxix. 4 Messogis. » Tmolus. 8 Col.

The next stream southward is the lesser Mseander, which is formed by the junction of two branches ; the shorter coming by a southerly course from Kiziljah Musa Tagh, and the longer flowing west ward from the Messogis range, near Tireh, or Caystrus. The trunk thus formed, bearing the name of the Kuchuk Mendereh, flows south-westward into the Gulf of Scala Nova, and by its position it evidently represents the second Mseander, as well as the Caystrus. 1 On the coast of Ionia may still be traced the sites of Ancient sites Pygela, Neapolis, Marathesiume, Teos, with the temple of inIonia ' Bacchus, Corycus, Phcenicus, Erythrse, and Phanu. 2 In the interior of Lydia also were many places of note, such as Larissa, Bagse, Tabala, Mseonia (Megne), Magne-ad-Sipylum, Apollonis, Attaleia (Adala), Carissa, Angame, Nicsea, Cay strus, Tripolis, Tralles, Nyssar, Magnesia, and the extensive remains of Saittse at Sidas Kal'eh. 3 At Yeni Bazar are the ruins of a theatre, a stadium, and those of the celebrated temple of Diana Leucophryne, which was scarcely exceeded by that of Ephesus. 4 But the original Asia was still more remarkable, in consequence of possessing five of the seven churches of the Apocalypse. 5 Those within its limits are Thyatira, Philadelphia, Ephesus, Sardis the ancient, and, lastly, Smyrna, the commercial capital and great emporium of Lower Asia. The first of these sites, once the Hyda, or Hyde of Homer 6 and of the Maeonians, 7 occupies a beautiful situation on the banks of the Pactolus, where the remains of a theatre, a stadium, a palace, the vast Ionic temple of 1 Col.

The rugged, picturesque mountains, which for nearly 20 miles extend along the northern and southern shores of the Gulf of Ismir, give it an European rather than an Asiatic character ; for the capacious inlet is not by any means unlike some of the firths in Scotland. Near the southern side of the entrance is the fine anchorage of Oarlse (Vourla), and at the bottom, or eastern extremity of the inlet, is the harbour of Smyrna, which is defended by a respectable castellated building, and affords a fine anchorage close to the wharfs. Smyrna. The city, with its extensive groves of cypress, orange, and fig-trees, rises amphitheatrically from the water's edge in the form of a triangle, some of the ancient walls remaining, and a castle on Mount Pagus constituting its apex; Turk town forms the western, and Frank town ? with its stores, wharfs, &amp;c., the eastern, or opposite extremity. Plain houses, with tiled roofs and gaudily painted balconies, some twenty mosques, and a proportion of khans, baths, and kiosks, interspersed! together with the prominent buildings which display the flags, and not unfrequently the taste, of the different European consuls, produce an effect which is at once striking and peculiar to Smyrna. The mixture of styles of architecture the picturesque environs of the city, and the numerous vessels belonging to all nations which ride at anchor or stand under sail, constitute a coup d'oeil almost rivalling that which is presented by the splendid scenery of the Bosphorus. The population approaches 130,000, and consists of about 1 Leake's Asia Minor, p. 265. Journal written during an Excursion in Asia Minor in 1838, by Charles Fellows Esq 289. . Herodotus. lib.

Sets of athletic porters removing weighty boxes, or ponderous bales of goods suspended between two poles, and wine and other shops stocked with European goods, mark the limits of the Frank quarter; the rest of the town shows the varied cos tumes of the Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Mugrebbins, and the still more important looking Chavasses of the Consuls and other authorities. Near the suburbs are seen the Xebeques and other sun-burnt inhabitants of the interior provinces : these people invariably avoid the town, remaining outside with their camels till the delivery of their goods enables them once more to enjoy the open country. The remains of a theatre, portions of cisterns, and a stadium, and antiquity, in addition to the medals found at different times, show that the present town occupies the site of the queen of Asiatic cities. Besides being the seat of the arts and sciences, it was one of the thirteen which contended for the honour of having given birth to Homer; 1 and, on its reparation, 2 Alexander the Great bestowed such care and pains that Strabo pronounced it to be the finest of all the Ionian cities. 3 According to the same authority, the name was derived from Smyrna, an Amazon who conquered Ephesus, from whence her followers advancing, drove away the Leleges, or iEolians, 4 and built ancient Smyrna, 5 20 stadia from the present city; but being driven out, they retired to Colophon, and afterwards they took possession of the actual site. 6 Ancient Smyrna was at the bottom of the Hermeean Gulf, 1 It contained a statue and temple dedicated to Homer, and coins Were struck to commemorate this locality as his birth-place.-^Strabo, lib, XlV., p. 646.

Kar£i arie80f The g overnment of Kara-si touches that of Saru-khan, from whence it extends northward, along the coast of iEolis, till it joins that of Bighah, and again eastward, to the borders of Khodavendi-kar, a little beyond Balikesri (Csesarea), the chief town. Near its northern extremity it has the river, which, after a short course, falls into the Gulf of Adra- myttium; and, at its southern limits, the Bergama-sti, or Caicus, which has a western course from Kirkagatsh, where the trunk is formed by the junction of several branches coming from the interior towards the north and east.

Some few valleys, such as the Kemereh, are highly cultivated and beautiful; 2 but, for the most part, the country is without villages and covered with plane-trees, olives, and pines, with an underwood of laurel, arbutus, vine, clematis, woodbine, and myrtle. 3 The shores of the island of Mitylene, however, are still richer; and its capital occupies the slope of a peninsula at the water's edge, above and on each side of which are seen a succession of rich valleys, with villages and kiosks peeping through wooded slopes and rich underwood. The kiosks, for the sake of coolness, are of a peculiar construction, being either a kind of turret raised on four posts above the ground, or a wooden building surmount ing a square stone tower, beyond which it projects on every side. In addition to the island of Mitylene, Kara-si contains the Sanjaks of Balikesri, Adramyti, Sandarli, and Ayasmund. ' Herodotus, Life of Homer, c. ii. Strabo, lib.

It is intersected by the Kaz Tagh (Mount Ida), an offset from Mount Olympus, which runs north-west, having inferior groups to the eastward and westward; and it is watered by several remarkable streams, springing from the slopes of this range. On the eastern side are the rivers ^Esepus, Granicus, and Rhodius. The first, under the name of the Boklu, or Sataldere, takes an eastern course from the loot of Mount Ida, and afterwards flows northward to the shores of Marmora, west of Cyzicus. The second, also called Ostrola, has two sources 1 in the same quarter ; its estuary is a few miles westward of the Boklu-su; and the third, or Madem Tschaldar, flows from the northern slopes of Mount Ida to the Dardanelles, at the town of Charnak-Kareh-si. On the western side of the Kaz Tagh the Ghuimbruck-su has its springs near Saliklar, from whence it winds westward by the temple of the same name; after passing near Ilium Novum, it turns northward, and terminates in the Dar danelles. The interior of Bighah presents an undulating surface, its ancient covered with olives, plane-trees, walnuts, &amp;c., besides an cltie8 ' underwood of laurel, myrtle, arbutus, and an abundance of the valonia oak. In addition to the pashalik of the Dar danelles, this A'yanlik contains the towns of Kapouda-keui, Bunarbashi, and Bighah, the seat of the local government; it includes the pashalik of the Dardanelles, and, together with the preceding district of Kara-si, it very nearly represents the Mysia of the ancients.

Buffaloes, wild boars, herons and other aquatic birds feed in the numerous marshes. At Hissarjik, about four miles westward of north from Buiiarbashi, are the ruins of New Ilium; and three miles onward, in the same direc tion, is Mount Tepe, or the tumulus of Ajax, having the supposed ruins of Rhoeteum on its northern side, overlooking the Hellespont. The position of ancient Troy at Buharbashi determines the Course of the river eastward of it to be the Simois, and that on the west Scailoander - the Scamander of Homer. 1 The course of the latter, after passing the village, is nearly north-west, or almost parallel to the Mendereh (the Simois) for about a mile and a half, and it forms a marsh, on the eastern side of which, at some distance onward, may be traced the remains of a bed once carrying its waters into the Simois ; but at present the prin cipal stream of the Scamander makes a tortuous course of about two miles along the western side of the marsh to Yerkasee Keui, from whence a canal conducts nearly the whole of the stream, by some mills, to the Mediterranean at Beshika Bay. A small portion, however, still runs into the Mendereh, which makes a tortuous course from thence, in the general direction of north, to the sea at the town of Kum Kal'eh-si. Half a mile southward of the latter place, between the Mendereh and the sea, are the tumuli called after Achilles and Patroclus; and a little further along the iEgean, beyond the village of Yerii Shehr, are the ruins of Siffeum 2 and Achilleum, near the tomb of the former hero. 3 The other streams to be noticed are the Khalifatli- Asmak or Heptaporos, and the Dumbrek-su. The former flows through the Troad a few hundred yards eastward of the Mendereh, and, after receiving the latter, the ancient Thymbrius, it falls into the Hellespont by one branch near 1 Iliad, lib.

A little lower, on the Asiatic side, there is another Turkish town of some size, called Lampsaki, close to which the current sweeps as before, nearly south-west, to the bay oi feestos, a distance of about 20 miles, with an ordinary width of from two and a half to three miles. This bay pre sents the rich and varied scenery which terminates the two great continents, whose shores are bordered by ranges of ele vated wooded hills, clothed with productive vineyards, inter mixed with groves of chesnut trees and oaks, together with broom, arbutus, cistus, and myrtle.

The distance from castle to castle is almost two miles, and there is the additional difficulty of a current of three miles per hour to be stemmed by an ascending fleet from thence to Cape Berber. At this passage, which is one mile and three-quarters wide, commence those defences which become so formidable on approaching the narrowest part of the Dardanelles, where an increased current and a sharp bend combine to give effect to different batteries mounting about 600 guns, most judi ciously placed, so as not only to give a cross fire at the distance of 760 yards, 1 but likewise to rake ships at certain places ; and this without causing any injury to the works on the opposite side.

They are usually but little above the surface of the water, and the last, in going upwards, is Chamli Burnu (Pine Point), a battery of 30 guns, on the point of Sestos, pro bably near the spot where the famous bridge of Xerxes touched the European shore. On a projecting point opposite to Kilidu-l-Bahr is the Asiatic and Asiatic castles, Tchannak Kalesi, Charnak Kal'eh-si, having, like the cas &amp; ' other, heavy batteries on each flank looking up and down the stream; in addition to which there is one of a semicircular form on Point Berber, three miles from thence in the latter direction, and two others on the horns of the bay eastward of the castle; the more distant of these, which is called Nakarah Burnu (Cape Drum), is a stone work, mounting about 84 guns, nearly on the 1 1520 yards from castle to castle.

The calibre of these ponderous guns varies from 18 inches to 3 feet in diameter; and, as their muzzles project beyond the face of the work, they must necessarily be loaded outside of the embrasures ; and they are, in consequence, kept ready to fire at any thing coming within the direct line. No vessel is permitted to pass except be tween sun-rise and sun-set, when a Tezkereh, or pass, must be obtained from the authorities for this purpose. The castles and defences are intrusted to a Mir Miran, or superior pasha, who resides in the Asiatic castle, around which is the town, containing about 9000 souls, and several potteries; but, owing to the marshes westward, towards the plains of Troy, it is at certain seasons very unhealthy.

A colony appears to have passed into Mysia from the banks of the Ister, 2 but the country was previously occu pied by people from Lydia; 3 and hence the ancient Mysians were considered to be Lydians by some, and Thracians bv others. 4 Khodavendi-kar, the next tract, stretches eastward from Bighah to Kodjah-ili, and from the shores of the Propontis southward to Sultan-Om, beyond Olympus. It contains the towns of Yeni-Shehr, Bazar-keui, and the district of rusa; and, except that it includes a small portion of the extremity of Mysia, it represents the western part of Bithynia. 1 Kodjah-ili, the adjoining A'yanlik, has that of Boli and the estuary of the Sakariyah on the east, Khodavendi-kar on the west, and Sultan-Ofii on the south.

This tract contains the towns of Kadi-Keui and Iscondar, in addition to Ismkmid, the seat of government; and it represents the central part of Bithynia. Boli has the Black Sea on the north, the Eyalet of Kasta- Boundaries of muni on the east, Kojah-ili and the lower Sakariyah on the B61, ' west; and on the south, portions of the districts of Sultan Ohi and Angora. It contains the towns of Filiyas, Hisar- Aiilu, and ErekM on the coast, Oura-shehr to the south, and Boli in the interior; the latter is the seat of government for this portion of territory, which, together with Kojah-lli and the chief part of Sultan Ohi, as well as of Khoda-vendi- kar, is comprehended within the limits of ancient Bithynia. The chain of the Taurus has already been followed into this province : it becomes higher, and its northern branches more numerous, as it approaches the centre; and it is still more elevated towards the western limits, where the country is very mountainous. In addition to the affluents of the Sakariyah, already its rivers, noticed, the province is well watered by several considerable streams ; one of the largest of these is the Filiyas, which, from its source at the foot of Yaila Tagh, has a N.N.E. course towards the Black Sea, receiving about midway the S6ghanli-su, a river whose affluents rise far to the eastward, and so close to those of the Parthenius that they have been hitherto considered as flowing into the latter, instead of running westward. One of these affluents, the Araj, flows from the western side of the Kastamuni hills, and unites with a western branch, the Namamli, or Cherkesh; and, two hours from thence, it is augmented by the S6ghanli-su com ing S.S.W. through Za'faran Boli: the trunk thus formed, having forced a passage through the Orminius range at the foot of the Sarkhun Yaila-si, it subsequently receives the Milan-su (Hypius) ; and, having afterwards entered the Filiyas, or Billeeus, the latter runs northward into the322 RIVERS OF BlTHYNIA.

Five other streams descend from the mountains between this and the Sakariyah ; 2 and, finally, westward of the latter is the Rhyndacus, separating Bithynia from Mysia. This stream, the Edrenos of the Turks, waters a part of the plain of Kutahiyah and the ruins of Azani; it then skirts the southern side of Mount Olympus, and, after forming the lake of Apollonia, and receiving below it the Kara-Der6h-su and the Su-Sighirli-su, it falls into the Pro- pontis. The Su-Sighirli-su, which represents the ancient Macestus, 3 comes by a northerly course from Singerli; to which place, under the name of the Simaul-su, it flows in a westerly direction, skirting the Demirji range from its source in the lake of Simaul. 4 Previously to Mr. Hamilton's journey the Su-Sighirli-su was supposed to terminate in Lake Maniyas, or Miletopolis, a considerable piece of water about 15 miles westward of Apollonia. The tract constituting the ancient Bithynia is remarkable for the extensive and picturesque inlets of Ismid and Mou- dania, and the beautiful fresh-water lakes of Iznik, Cgesarea, Gallus, ?abanjah-gol, Yeni-Shehr, and others of inferior size, which give additional interest to scenery almost everywhere striking.

This site is partly occupied by Harakli (Band Eregli), a modern town of 1500 souls, situated a little way eastward of the Kilij, or Lycus river. 2 Towards the interior are Duseprum, or Duzchah, a village having some Byzantine remains ; Prusa-ad-Hypium, near the town of Uskub, with some Pelasgian architecture; Latania, now Khandak ; and, lastly, Hadrianopolis, near which is Boli, the chief town of the district. This place contains about 4000 inhabitants, and is built on the slope of a hill overlooking a fertile plain covered with villages and cultivation. 3 Near the western bank of the Sakariyah are Agrilium, now Agriiium, Vezir Khan; Leucae, at the neat town of Lefke, which is eucae ' situated in the middle of a beautiful valley between the Gallus branch and the Sakariyah; and Sophon (now Sabanjah), a town of 200 houses, built upon the edge of the lake, amidst inviting forest scenery. In the interior, towards the S.S.W., and on the eastern borders of Lake Ascania, are the extensive walls, gates, and still perfect battlements of Nicsea; within which are the remains of temples, with some inscriptions belonging to the Grecian city; and also the, present village of Isnik, amidst the ruins of mosques and baths belonging to the Turkish city. Five hours northward is ancient Nicomedia, now Isnikmld, Nicomedia. or Ismid, a town containing about 30,000 inhabitants, with a dock-yard.

Towards the former extremity there are six bridges crossing the valley ; and some of these have on them rows of houses forming the continuation of the principal streets, which are paved and clean. The houses of Brusa are better and more substantial than they are in other parts of Asiatic Turkey, and the kiosks, gardens, baths, and other public buildings bordering the rich plain, constitute part of a luxuriant and pleasing landscape.

The width of the channel, on quitting the Black Sea, from the Cyanese rocks to the Asiatic shore, is nearly a mile and three-quarters, and the direction of the current from thence nearly S.W., between hills clothed with junipers and other shrubs, and rising abruptly from the water: the width gradually decreases, till, at two miles from the entrance, the passage between the new castles scarcely exceeds half a mile. Nearly one mile and three-quarters onward are Rum-ili, Hisar, and Anadoli Hisar, or the Old Castles, commanding a passage of 1100 yards in width: ori ginally they were similar to those of the Dardanelles, but not326 Buyukdereh.

This inlet usually contains a fleet of Turkish men-of-war and numerous European merchant vessels, anchored opposite the country palaces of the ambassadors, which adorn the shore from hence to Therapia. A little below the latter situation the current forms a deep bay on the Asiatic side, and sweeps westward to Balti Liman, from whence it flows southward between Rum-ih-hisar and Anaddli-hisar, where the width is but 600 yards. 1 A little lower stands the most recent of the numerous palaces belonging to the late Sultan, who, in oppo sition to the superstitious feelings of the Turks, erected it on the shores of Anadoli.

Southward of Angora are some streams running into the Halys; the western side of the territory is watered by the Enkun-su and some other affluents of the Sakariyah, whilst to the north and west are those of the Filiyas and Bartan. It has just been shown that the geography of the former is different from that which has been hitherto represented in the best maps; and this is likewise the case with the latter river. 1 See above, page 5. 2 Ibid., pages 5 and 6.CHAP.

The western of these, the ICojahnas Irmak, has two sources near the village of K6- jahnas, and the trunk, 28 yards wide, which is formed by their junction, runs through a deep alluvial soil at the rate of two miles and a half per hour, with an ordinary depth of six or eight feet, which is occasionally increased to 14 or 18 feet. 1 The O'rdeiri, the eastern and more considerable branch, flows N.W. from the foot of the Durnah Yailasi, in the district of Za'faran Boll; and from thence to the sea-port of Bartan, a town of 650 houses, occupying the rich valley of the Parthenius: 8 the trunk formed by this and the pre ceding river is called the Su Chati. The surface of the district of Angora, westward of the Features of city, presents a succession of level tracts, scarcely broken by Angora ' low, barren, undulating hills, without timber or cultivation. Towards the N.E. cultivation prevails from Angora to Hasan O'ghlan; to this succeeds the district of Kankari, a cold upland of gypsum, 3 interspersed with volcanic cones, such as Karajah Weran 4 (Burnt Mountain), and some cultivated valleys. In one of these is Yaprakli, which is celebrated for an annual fair of seven days; and another, the vale of Tosiyah, is remark able for its fields, gardens, and vineyards, which, as well as the town itself, the ancient Decia, are watered by the Gok-sti (Celestial stream). 5 The central part of the adjoining district of Kastamum is and the centre occupied by the extensive upland formed by the Iflanis 0 f of ? astamuw - Za'faran-Boli, and Kastamuni, together with those of Dadahi and Saban Chilah, which lie to the N.E. of Mount 1 Mr. Ainsworth's Journey: Vol. IX.

But its more precise limits were the Parthenius on the west, the Halys on the east, and Galatia on the south. 2 The towns in the bordering district of Western Galatia Town8of are, Iskelib, a place of considerable extent, with a castle Galatia. perched upon a singularly bold and naked rock ; 3 Kal'ah-jik, a town of 900 houses, at the base of an isolated conical rock, the summit of which is occupied by a castle built above the houses ; 4 and ancient Changn, now Kankari, the principal place in the district of that name, with a ruined castle, several mosques, khans, and public baths ; it contains 18,000 or 20,000 souls, and is a place of considerable trade, though hitherto unknown as such to Europeans. 5 The metropolitan city of Angora and its citadel occupy Description of two rocky hills, nearly in the centre of Western Galatia. Angora ' The town is watered by one of the affluents of the Sangarius, and contains about 10,000 Muhammedans, 5000 Christians, and 200 Jews.

Its western side is mountainous, being intersected by the chain of the Murad Tagh and its numerous ramifications, which in close the valleys of the Rhyndacus, Macestus, Hermus, and Meeander. The western side consists chiefly of plains lying along the upper branches of the Sangarius ; whilst the centre is an extensive upland, of which the plain spreading in a south-westerly direction, from the Kutahiyah beyond Altun Tash, is nearly 50 miles long by 20 miles wide, and has an elevation probably exceeding 4000 feet above the Black Sea. The small Sanjaklik of Sultan Ohi, now a dependency of Sultan Ow.&amp;c.

Nearly 22 miles E.N.E. from thence is Kutahiyah, with an extensive castle, which is partly ancient, and occupies a high hill close to the S.S.W. side; this castle is pro bably on the site of Cotyseium. The city is at the entrance of a valley, and at the foot of the Poorsal Tagh, on the western side of the plain. It contains the usual proportion of mosques, khans, baths, fountains, bazars, and about 10,000 houses with tiled roofs like those of European Turkey; subterraneous aqueducts run beneath the streets. It is the usual residence of the Vezir of Anadoli, but Kutahiyah and its 32 dependent villages are under a Musellim. South-east of the capital are' the interesting Phrygian remains with inscriptions, and the Troglodyte habitations of Doganlu, probably ancient Nacoleia ; 3 southward is the A'yan- Aituu Tash, lik of Altun-Tash; and to the south-west those of Gediz, a picturesque town on the borders of Mysia, with a striking mosque; and 'Ushak, a still larger place, which is celebrated lor the best manufactory of Turkey carpets. 4 At the eastern side of the district, near the borders of that of Afiyum Kara- J^ar, are the Aghaliks of Segicler, ancient Sebaste, 5 and Ishekli (Eumenia), 6 a picturesque little town. ^ ™ a w 8 Minor ' v ' 19 ' 2 Ibid ' 142 - 3 Ibicl -' PP- 24 . 34. t ; J ; I ? amilt0n ' Vo1 - VI1 - Part 1 ' P- 38 ' of the Royal Geographical Tat w Arundell,s Discoveries in Asia Minor, Vol. I., pp. 104, 105 . 7; J ' neon's Journey, Vol. VII.

The former are at Selenti, and the latter near the village of Sidas Kal'eh, where are the remains of a stadium, several temples, and other public buildings. 6 Nine hours, or about 22 miles S.S.E. of these Phrygian remains, is the modern town of Kulah, at an eleva tion of about 2250 feet above the sea. It contains upwards of 1500 gloomy-looking houses, 7 built of lava at the foot of the volcanic cone 8 called Kara Devlit (black inkstand). This is one of the three remarkable pits or bellows noticed by Strabo as belonging to the Katakekaumene, or under burnt district, which extended 500 stadia in length by 40 stadia in width along the borders of Phrygia and Lydia. 9 From the southern side of Kulah a rugged stream of lava has forced its way through the plain of Sandal and Kaplan Alan, till its course was broken by the Hermus.

The present inhabitants are of that mixed de scription which prevails throughout the peninsula, amongst whom the nomadic Kurds and Turkomans hold a prominent place: but according to Herodotus, the Phrygians were bar barians, and the most ancient of all people. 2 Hamid extends from Afiyum-Kara-hisar southward to the Lakes of district of Tekeh and the Taurus, having Aidin and Mentesha ami ' on the west. It is separated from the latter Pashalik by the chain of Baba Tagh; and it is watered on this, or the western side, by the Kopli-su, the Banas Chai, and other affluents of the river Mendereh. Near the eastern side of the district is the extensive and beautiful lake of Egerdir, 3 which now unites with that of Hoiran to the north ; and farther west is the lake of Ascania, in the midst of beautiful scenery. 4 The government is intrusted to a Vaivodeh, who resides in its principal Isbartah, a well-built town, interspersed with gardens and 0WI1S ' watered by numerous streams. 5 In addition to places of in ferior note, Hamid contains the towns of Yalobach, Antioch, Buldur, and Egerdir, with its castle, and it is picturesquely situated at the southern extremity of the lake of that name.

Towards t:he western side it is watered by the Cheena Chai (Marsyas), and other affluents of the Maeander ; and towards the east by the Dalamon Chai or Indus. The latter, which probably likewise represents the Calbis 1 of Strabo and Ptolemy, 8 has its source at Mount Cibyrates, in Greater Phrygia; it is joined by 60 rivers, besides torrents, during its course to its estuary, near the city of Caunus, 3 and by the Patara or Xanthus, with the Maugher Chai' and numerous other affluents. Within its limits also are the extensive lakes of Ayelan- Ghieul, Schedder Yaila, Ghieul Hisar, and Kenygeeze, in addition to numerous inlets, such as the Gulfs of Mandelyah, Kos, Makri, Karagia-aghatch, and the magnificent harbour of Marmarass.

The latter is near the village of Minara, and exhibits a pile of ruins, comprising numerous rock-tombs and sarcophagi, in addition to a temple and a theatre, which are backed by the rugged peaks of Cragus, and command a striking view of the country surrounding the rich valley of the Xanthus. 2 Towards the lower part of this valley are the ruins of the ancient capital, comprising a theatre, several temples, triumphal arches, walls, and elaborate tombs' altogether displaying the most elegant designs, with highly finished poetical subjects in bas-relief. 3 The site of Xanthus itself is extremely romantic, portions of the ruins being on beautiful hills; others rise perpendicularly from the winding river, or crown the summits of rocks, whilst a rich plain, the mountain chain of Patra and the range of Cragus, complete the panorama 4 of the most considerable of all the cities of Lycia. 5 The inscriptions lately found in the Lycian character are of great importance in connexion with the early history of that country, since they belong to a period antecedent to its occu pation by the Greeks. Col. Leake, however, in his remarks on the inscl-iptions, &amp;c., found in Caria and Lycia by Messrs Forbes and Hoskyns, observes, that we cannot safely ascribe an earlier date to those inscriptions than the fifth century B.C., or about the period when Lesser Asia was subject to Darius Hystaspes. We know that the first colonists from Greece to Lycia settled m the valley of the Syrbes or Xanthus; but it was not till about two centuries before the Trojan war that thev succeeded in driving the ancient inhabitants'from the recesses of Mount Solyma. 6 Subsequently Lycia appears to have been governed by a kind of federation, consisting of six principal, and 17 secondary cities; deputies were sent from each, and the governors, magistrates, &amp;c., were chosen from the whole ' lp° lonel Leake ' s Remarks on Mr. Hoskyns's Survey.

The tombs and excavations of Xanthus, as well as the vestiges of Tlos, and other ruins, dis play a different style of architecture from that of the Greeks or Romans ; and we find that a separate language, and a peculiar written character, likewise prevailed in the country. 3 By some, the Lycian language is supposed to be derived Ancient from the Syro-Phoenician, whilst, from its resemblance to the language - Sanscrit and Zend, Grotefend and others conclude that it belongs to the extensive Indo-Germanic family, 4 which would seem to link the inhabitants of this portion of the peninsula with those of ancient Assyria, and consequently with the Phoenicians of the latter region. 5 According to Herodotus, the Lycians derived their name First inhabi- from Lycus, the son of Pandion, who came into the country tante ' on being expelled from Athens ; but after the arrival of the Cretan chief, Sarpedon, they bore the name of Termilae. Previously they were called Solymi, and at an earlier period Milyans, from Milyas the first name of the territory. 6 But the colony conducted into Lesbos by Xanthus, and the contin gents sent, about five centuries later, to the Trojan war by the Termilae and Troes, 7 the two principal nations of Lycia, claim for that people a more remote origin.

Therefore, instead of the in habitants of this part of the peninsula having come originally from Syro-Phoenicia, it is probable that the spread of mankind carried a Lycian colony in the latter direction. Stephanus states, 2 that Ascalon was built by Ascalus, a Lydian; and a direct connexion must once have subsisted between Asia Minor and the countries southward, since Lud or Lydus, the grandson of Meon, Menes or Osiris, who reigned over Lydia, Phrygia, &amp;c., 3 subsequently under the name of Mizraim reigned over Egypt. 4 It may be added, that Tyrrhenus emigrated westward from Lydia, 5 and Pelops from Phrygia, when these countries were dependencies of Assyria. 6 The Pashalik just described (Mogolla) completes the districts of the Vezirate of Anadoli; the other governments yet to be noticed, westward of the Kizil-Irmak, are Koniyeh, Mar'ash, and I'ch-ili. The first of these, which is aiso called Kharidj or Karaman Proper, has, on the west, the Sultan Tagh, which separates it from the districts of Tekeh and Hamid; on the north Kara-hisar and Angora; on the east Mar'ash and part of Sivas, and on the south Fch-iH, or rather the interven ing chain of the Taurus. Besides the district immediately around the capital, the Pashalik of Koniyeh comprises, towards the west, the San- jaks of Isaura, Seidi-shehr, Beg-shehr, and Ak-shehr; towards the east the Musellimlik of Ak-serai', the Vaivodehliks of 1 Herod., lib.

Towards its eastern limits tlie district is watered by some of of the affluents of the Kizil-Irmak and Euphrates, and towards Kharid ^ its southern limits by those of the Saihun and Jaihan, but in the northern and western quarters it is more scantily supplied by other streams, which, after short courses, usually terminate either in lakes or marshes. In this extensive Pashalik there is a marked contrast be- Its mountains, tween the scenery and character of the country near its eastern and western limits. At the latter extremity the great barriers of the Taurus and Sultan Tagh present a bold, elevated, and rugged outline, having near the base some cultivation; in the lower regions the oak, ilex, arbutus, lentisk, and juniper abound, and above, are forests of pines ; amidst the forests are several fine valleys and small plains, forming, with the sur rounding rocks and woods, the most beautiful scenery. 1 North-eastward of the mountains there is a wide-spreading and lakes, bare surface, separated nearly in the centre by the south western prolongation of the limestone range of Emir Tagh, 8 which runs to Ladik. From hence a volcanic formation con tinues to Kara Bunar, and is lost in the Taurus ; 3 elsewhere it is divided by the undulations which mark the limits of the different plains, such as those of Koniyeh, Nigdeh, Bulavadin, Ak-shehr, &amp;c. These tracts are almost exclusively pastoral; many of them being not only marshy, but partially inundated at certain seasons. Permanent villages, with some trees and a little cultivation, are however occasionally seen; and the surface of the district is still further diversified by a series of lakes, forming nearly an equilateral triangle, which extends about 120 miles to the north-east. The base of the figure is formed by three sheets of water lying between the ranges of Sultan Tagh and Emir Tagh. The centre of these is the 1 Leake's Journal in Asia Minor, pp. 104 and 105; and Fellowes's Journal, pp. 165, HI, 175. 2 Mr. Ainsworth's Journey, Vol. X.

The plain spreads round, on the eastern side, to Emir Tagh, and on the western to Sultan Tagh. At the foot of the latter are the villages of Isakli and Essenek Keui, with several others; and at about six miles south of the extremity of the lake is Ak-shehr (once Philomelium), the residence of the Musellim of the district. The town contains two fine mosques and about 600 houses, rising above each other on the slope of Sultan Tagh, amidst luxuriant fruit-gardens; and northward of these is a castle, with the remains of other buildings. The district appears to represent Phrygia Paro- reius, and the ruins alluded to may be those of Philomelium which were to the north at the commencement of a plain. 4 The remaining lake, forming the apex of the triangle, is called Tu z Goh or Tuz Choli (salt desert), and by the Turkomans 1 uzlah (Saltern or Salt-work). 5 Its extent may be estimated at 45 miles from south to north, with a width varying between Caralitis of Strabo.-—Mr. W.

The great lake is without fish, extremely salt, and shallow towards its borders, which usually terminate in marshes. The plains on the eastern side contain the tents of the people, pas ture lands, and the salt mines of Tuz Koi. 2 On the western side are the habitations of the Kurds, who occupy the plains spreading from Iskil (a town of 400 houses) round the Murad Soho Goli, or Murad-su-Golu, salt lake, which latter, how ever, is almost dried up in summer. With the latter, the Palus Tattseus of the ancients, 3 the Towns of monotonous plains of Koniyeh terminate. The towns at the * ai?ar,yah - north-eastern extremity of the district are Kara-hisar Yara- pason (Osiana), with 300 houses on the banks of the Halys ; 4 Neu-Shehr, a pleasing and cleanly place, with 2800 houses, on the side of a bold rocky ravine ; also the town and valley of Injeh-su (slender water), which contains 1500 good houses, under the government of a Musellim; and, finally, the similar government of Kai'sariyah, once Mazaca, 5 and the Mishag of the Armenians. It is the chief place of the small district called Kai'sar by the Turks, which extends a little way round Mount Arjish, and nearly represents Cappadocian Cilicia. 6 The city contains about 8000 substantial houses, of which pro bably one-fourth are tenantless; it occupies a portion of the fine plain lying south south-eastward of Arjish Tagh ; and it has in the interior a castle nearly on the same level as that of the exterior walls. The Cursor Jami', and some of the other mosques, are fine buildings, and the bazars are good, but else where there are evident symptoms of decay.

The Selatyns, or royal mosques of Sherif Altun, Sultan Alau- d-din, and that of Sultan Selim, are fine specimens of the delicate tracery and laboured fret-work belonging to the later architecture of I'ran, as are some of the Jami's, and a few of the numerous Medresehs or colleges of this city; and the sepulchral chapel of the Persian poet, Mevlani Jelalu-d-din (Aladdin). The site of the ancient palace of the warrior Sultan Selim is now occupied by the Konak of the P^sha, in which are some Arabesque remains; but the building is an ordinary Turkish house of wood and clay, with a dirty out side staircase leading from a spacious court to the reception rooms. Walls about 30 feet high, flanked at intervals by square its population, towers, and, like those of the ancients, perfectly vertical, sur round the city, which has a circumference of nearly 3 miles, independently of extensive suburbs on the eastern and south eastern sides, besides Zilleh, an independent Greek town of 800 houses, situated 4 miles N.N.E. from it. The population rather exceeds 40,000 souls, 2 a part of whom are employed in the manu facture of carpets and in the preparation of leather, cotton, wool, and hides. The gardens of Koniyeh produce a variety of fruits ; and the plain supplies grain, flax, &amp;c., in addition to an abundance of pasture. At one period of the year a consi derable part of the plain is inundated; but the inhabitants do not appear to suffer from malaria to the extent which might be expected. The inhabitants of the Pashalik consist of Turks, who and mhabi- dwell in the towns; Kurds and Turkomans, living alternately in the plains and mountains; and Troglodyte Christians, of whose origin as a people there does not seem to be any his torical or traditional trace. 3 We know, however, that the 1 Plin., lib.

Mar'ash^ Tlle P ^ sll ^ lik of Mar'ash extends from that of Koniyeh eastward to the Euphrates, and again southward from the Sivas district to the borders of Syria. With the excep tion of the comparatively level country towards the river, it consists almost entirely of lofty and wooded mountains, being traversed by a portion of the Anti-Taurus near its northern limits, by Taurus Proper near its centre, and more southward by a part of the Durdun Tagh, from which the Amanus branch runs in a S.S.W. direction into Syria. This part of the Pashalik is amply watered by the affluents of the rivers already described (pages 295 to 301), viz. the Saihun and Jaihan, in addition to the eastern Melas and other streams which flow into the Euphrates. At its eastern limits, on the banks of the Euphrates, is the Musellimik of Gergen Kaleh-si, and between this place and the capital are those of Besui, a town of 2800 houses, in a limestone glen, without gardens'or even trees, and Adiyaman or Hisn Mansur (ancient Carbanum), which contains several mosques, the remains of a castle, and' about 1100 houses in the midst of gardens and groves. 3 Sb ti0n 0f ^ 0n tlle slo P es of tllis P art of the Ta urus, also, are the small districts and towns of Kakhtah, Kerkun, Bozuk, Tokariz, and Sumeisat, each under a Kurdish Boyah Bey. Again, north ward are those of Ali-shehr, A1 Bostan, and Yarpus. ' West ward is the A'yanlik of Kars, and southward, almost on the borders of Syria, are Riam Kal'ah (already described) and Am-tab, the supposed Antiochia ad Taurum. This city is on the river Sajur, at the foot of the mountains, and near the commencement of the plain leading to Aleppo: it is shut in, ^ i! tlle plain ' by a low ran g e of ; and, on a detached hill, rising above the higher part of the town, at the opposite extremity, is the castle, a respectable work, strikingly like that of Aleppo. 4 In addition to some fine mosques and 3 M er0d A • lib ' L 'J* ^ 2 Strabo ' lib - XII., p. 544.

It has commercial communications with Aleppo, O'rfah, Mar'ash, and the port of Alexandretta, and is, on the whole, a place of more importance than the capital itself: the inhabitants are occupied with the manufacture of calico. About midway, on the slope of the lofty Aghr Tagh, and City of projecting southward, are three remarkable shoulders : of these Mar,asb ' the central one is occupied by the castle, and the two others, as well as the intervening valleys, by the city of Mar'ash; the parts of which communicate with each other by several bridges. The city contains about 25 mosques of an inferior description, and 3500 houses of wood and clay; these are badly constructed, but striking from their situation, as this singular mountain town overlooks a rich plain about 30 miles long and from 12 to 16 miles wide, producing abundance of tobacco, with rice and other grains. On the slopes of this part of the Taurus the timber is particularly fine, and there is a mine of excellent iron, which is worked successfully; there is also a mine of native steel. Mar'ash, also called Kermania (the Germanicia of the Lower Empire), probably owed its existence to the pass through the Taurus, which is situated northward of this place along the slopes of the Ali-Shehr. The latter mountain is approached from two different direc- Passes of the tions, viz., southward from Ain-tab, and westward from the' laurus ' town of Sis. The former route passes through Mar'ash, and as far as that town it is tolerably good; but northward it becomes a mere bridle-path, winding along a succession of steep shoulders and precipitous valleys, which succeed one another almost to A1 Bostan. In quitting the plains of Cilicia, near Sis, the other route proceeds through the moun tain Kasabah of Kars, 1 from whence, as far as the junction with the Ain-tab road, and even beyond that point, it consists of a succession of the most intricate, difficult, and dangerous passes. The first route across the Taurus is, however, to the eastward, a little way from the Euphrates: it runs through the village A post-town in England represents relatively the Kasabah of Turkey.352 CILICIAN GATES. [CHAP. XV. of Pelvereh, the ancient Perre, and the connecting point in the Antonine Itinerary, between the routes from Cappadocia, Mesopotamia, Lesser Armenia, and Syria. The summit of this pass is near the picturesque village of Erkenek, which has an elevation of 3828 feet; and northward from thence, the bed of the Gok-sii is at once a road and a water-course, through a rocky glen of limestone precipices: this was lately made passable for artillery by Hafiz Pasha. The Pashalik of Mar'ash represents the eastern extremity of Cilicia with part of Cataonia and Melitene, and is thinly peopled by fixed inhabitants, consisting of Turks and Kurds, with a large proportion of Turkomans; the occupations of all are almost entirely agricultural. The narrow strip of I'ch-ili stretches westward from Mar ash to Tekeh, between the Taurus on the north and the Mediterranean on the south, and lies opposite to Cyprus, which forms part of the jurisdiction. On the western side of this territory, the Taurus sends those numerous branches which procured for the district the appropriate name of rugged Cilicia (Trachea); whilst the extensive plain of Adanah was distinguished by that of Cilicia Campestris, on the borders of which the slopes of the mountains terminate with a number of parallel branches enclosing fertile valleys. On one of the former, at the distance of 12 hours eastward of the Cilician Gates, stands the castle of the chieftain Badinjan O'ghlu, a massive pile of buildings with a platform about it, command ing a prospect of singular richness and beauty. Below are seen the Jaihan and Saihun, winding through the cultivation and pastures of the Turkoman tribes, who are spread over the plains of Tarsus, Adanah, and Misis; and more inwards, in the direction of Sis, there is a succession of cultivated valleys, separated by low shoulders, crowned with villages or rather hamlets embosomed in a rich foliage of oak, chestnut, arbutus, myrtle, &amp;c., with the Durdun Tagh and the rugged snow-clad peaks of Taurus in the back-ground. Towards the western termination of the arms thus prolong ing the slopes of Taurus to the level of Cilicia is the deep rent or fissure which extends throughout its width from theCHAP.

The S £* wm mgs of this break in the mountains give a distance of about 83 miles, the ride having, in my case, with good horses, con sumed 26^ hours. The pass has this peculiarity, that instead of traversing a high mountain, such as that of Ali-Shehr, it runs oyer a summit-level of moderate height towards each extremity; and as both are approached through deep rocky defiles, the celebrated gates may in consequence be considered as consisting of two distinct portions. Beginning southward, an ordinary mountain valley, having a width varying from 1 to 2 miles, winds north-westward between wooded shoulders, crowned with villages for a distance of about 25^ miles from the plain of Adanah to Golek Boghaz. The advanced posts of the Egyptians were near the latter point, where the pass nar rows to about half a mile; and a little forward, to about 200 yards, between precipitous ledges of limestone, rising to 200 and sometimes to more than 500 feet. On the lower parts of these ledges are occasionally seen traces of those extraordinary excavations which here and elsewhere show the difficulties surmounted by the ancients in opening their roads. Several high batteries occupy a tongue a little on one side, so as to command the pass from the approach, and prevent a direct attack. In the mountains, some 8 or 10 miles to the N.W., Mines, are the silver and lead mines, from which, at one time, Ibrahim Pasha vainly expected to fill his coffers almost without expense. The pass of Golek Boghaz has an elevation of about 3000 feet; the village of that name has 5000, and the mines 9000 feet, wliile the crest of this part of the Taurus is 13,000 feet. 1 North eastward of this part of the pass a water-course serves for a time as the road; and the scenery from thence by Menzil Khan is alpine, and scarcely less striking than that of the Ali-Shehr pass. Rocks protrude through pines, cedars, &amp;c.; and their bare conical summits rise above the woods to a height of 3000 or 4000 feet. This is succeeded by a narrow valley covered with pines, near which the Kara guhid su, the western affluent 1 According to the calculations made by Signor Borriano, the director of the mines, in 1835. VOL. I. ^ Z354 ANCIENT FYLJE. [CHAP. XV. The passes of the Saihun, directs its course southward along a grand and thfrrnks 7 picturesque valley, whilst a third valley presents a succession of'wooded hills as it runs E.N.E. by Bereketli Ma'den towards Kai'sariyeh. A short distance north-westward of the separa tion just noticed, high and bold rocks close in upon the road, as.well as upon the bed of the river, scarcely leaving a suffi ciency of room to pass north-westward along the latter; this leads into another wild and rocky valley, which runs from the opposite side of the stream. The approach to these valleys, especially from the southern side, is commanded by the bat teries and entrenchments which, till recently, were the advanced posts of the Sultan's troops. All things considered, these are stronger and more defensible than the southern defiles. This, no doubt, is the spot called Pylse, which was not only narrow and overlooked by the hills, but its approaches were broken by a number of streams spreading on every side from the foot of the mountain. 1 It is, in fact, difficult to imagine anything more formidable than would be the approach to either of the Pylse Cilicise; and if the passes just men tioned were the only means of entering the province, stones thrown from the heights would, as Alexander remarked, be sufficient to overwhelm the assailants; 8 but as there are valleys on the sides of these passes, it is obvious that their flanks may in every case be gained by foot soldiers, and not unfrequently ta h rned inaybe c&amp;va ^ r y also ma y turn tliem - Tta road, after clearing the pass, winds for a time along the wooded slopes, and then descends into an ordinary valley plain, in which is the castle of Mar'ash, and the town and castle of Nigdeh towards the commencement of the plain of Koniyeh. Although the dis tance to the latter from the plains of Cilicia is considerable, yet the route is comparatively level, and the passage is suited for caravans and even carriages ; and being the easiest route across the Taurus, as well as the most direct line of communi cation with the central parts of Asia Minor, its general use in ancient times may be easily accounted for.

In the interior, at some distance westward of Mout, 5 is Ermen^k, the ancient Philadelphia; and S.S.E. the ruins of Diocaesarea. The province of I'ch-ili comprehends the Pashaliks of Mout Si's, and Ain- and Adanah, the town of Adanah being the seat of govern- zarbah ' ment. The former territory, which constitutes the western part of the province, is very mountainous; and in this respect it contrasts strongly with the eastern portion, which is charac terized by extensive plains. Towards the north-east of the province is the castellated town of Sis, containing 1000 houses, which are built round a remarkable rock rising abruptly from the plain. A few miles south-eastward is the still more remarkable city of A'in-zarbah, the ruins of which are very distinct, and occupy the slope and crest of an isolated, lofty, and almost inaccessible rock near the banks of the Pyramus: and lower down on this river is Misis, the ancient Mopsuesta. Sixteen miles west by north of the latter is the capital of the district, a flourishing but ill-built town, contain ing 8000 houses and several good mosques.

T he soil throughout Asia Minor, with the exception of the volcanic and rocky districts, is very fertile, and the plains are amply watered by the rivers before mentioned, with their numerous affluents. A large portion of the surface, parti cularly in the territory bordering the two seas, and that near Tokat, consists of a fine alluvium, covered with rich herbage, or the finest grain crops. Its superficies rather exceeds that of Spain, which kingdom, according to Adrien Balbi, 1 con tains 137,400 square miles. An elevated plateau, furrowed with valleys and intersected by numerous chains of lofty mountains, characterizes the sur face of Asia Minor as it does that of Persia; yet the climate of the former differs essentially from that of the latter, and indeed of every other country with which we are acquainted, though it has been considered as most nearly resembling that of the European peninsula above mentioned: the modifica tion of the temperature, which is due to the geographical 1 Abrt5gt5 de Geographic, p. 595.358 CLIMATE SOUTHWARD OF THE TAURUS. [CHAP. XVI. position of Asia Minor, is, in consequence of the elevation of the country, considerable; and the variations produced by its forests, lakes, and rivers, are such that a general descrip tion can scarcely convey an adequate idea of the climate of this region. Asia Minor has three great natural divisions; the first and principal of which is the remarkable tract which, stretching from east to west between two great ranges, may be considered as one vast mountain—the Taurus of Strabo; 1 the second consists of numerous valleys and plains, forming the slopes of this elevated territory towards the shores of the Black Sea; and the third is a similar tract at the opposite extremity, or southward of Taurus; this constitutes the remainder of the peninsula. JboutTarsus In be g innin g with tlle climate of the last division, it will &amp;c. ' be found that, towards its eastern extremity, notwithstanding the temperate breezes from the sea on one side, and the wooded slopes of Taurus on the other, such an overpowering degree of heat is experienced, especially in the cotton and tobacco tracts near Tarsus, Adanah, and Sis, that a large por tion of the inhabitants are obliged to leave their crops for a time, and take shelter in the mountains, in order to avoid the formidable malaria engendered about those places. But in the remainder of this pashalik, and still further westward, in those of I'ch-ili, Tek6h, and Mentesha, the aspect of the country is greatly changed, and the temperature is lower. Instead of the uniformly rich soil of Campestris and Campus Aleius, 2 there is a succession of rocky and wooded mountains enclosing rich valleys or small plains, among which are the swamps near Limyra, those along the Dalomon Chai, 3 the Maeander, 4 and the Caystrus, 5 and also the marshes about Caunus, the noxious exhalations from which gave rise to the * Its width is said to be 3000 stadia, or nearly 340 miles : see above, p 71 • and Strabo, lib.

XVI.] CLIMATE NORTHWARD OF THE TAURUS. 359 * cynical remark of Stratonicus, the guitar player, that he could not call a city unhealthy in which even the dead continued to walk about. 1 During the trying and generally, to Europeans, fatal seasons of rain and extreme heat, it is the custom of the inhabitants of Caria and Lycia, after putting in their crops, 2 to remove to the mountains ; and a journey of one or two days is sufficient for the transport of the families from the sheltered but unhealthy valleys producing the orange, lemon, grape, tamarind, silk, and tobacco, 3 to an alpine temperature. But the climate which generally prevails at other seasons on the southern slopes of the Taurus, in a line eastward from Samos to the borders of the district of Tarsus, is quite agreeable, and accords with that which, by Herodotus, 4 has been ascribed to Ionia, Lydia, Caria, and Lycia. The tract of country whose climate approaches nearest to climate about that which has just been described lies along the shores of the ^ arabuzun ' Euxine and Propontis. The valleys, forests, and streams on the northern side of the Taurus produce, during summer, a great degree of humidity in the atmosphere within the limits of the Pashalik of Tarabuzun, while the warm breezes from the Black Sea diminish the severity which would otherwise prevail during the long winter in this mountainous region. Malaria prevails near the river Jorak as well as in some few Seasons for tracts along the coast westward of Tarabuzun; and on the flults approach of the unhealthy season (the autumn) some of the Laz remove from the town of Choruk-su to a better climate : 5 else where, although exposed to the effects of alternate heat and moisture, the climate of this extensive pashalik must be con sidered healthy. The seasons for the different kinds of grain, for hemp and flax, for the mulberry and other fruits, are late ; cherries are not ripe till the beginning of July, and figs and grapes, at soonest, towards the end of September. 1 Strabo, lib.

In the adjoining tract, which extends westward to the Halys, and also in Kastamnm, the mountain barrier of the Taurus continues to recede from the coast, and in these dis tricts the temperature is less humid than in the former; being, besides, less subject to sudden changes, there is but little malaria. SjXJT&amp;r' B61^, tlie next P rovince ' though in the same latitude, is exposed to a much greater degree of humidity, owing to the extensive forest, expressively called the sea of trees, which extends from east to west over the district of Boli and part of that of Kojah-ili. At the town of Bar tan especially, and at some places southward along the river which terminates at that place, and again near the Filiyas and Kilij rivers, fevers prevail towards autumn. The remainder of the last-men tioned pashalik, together with Khodavendi-Kar and Bighah, occupy the southern shores of the Propontis and Hellespont ^ the interior of this tract is remarkable for a diversified surface, consisting of numerous lakes embosomed in mountains, which are covered with forests of the Valonia oak, arbutus, &amp;c • it has on the south side the great barrier of the Olympic chain and on the north the deep inlets of the Sea of Marmara; and within its limits, the tepid breezes coming from the placid bosom of the latter assist materially in shortening the dura tion of the winter and in diminishing the heat of summer During both seasons a degree of mildness prevails which is scarcely known on the European shores of this sea; and with the exception of the town of Charnak-Kal'eh-si and the plain westward which suffer at times from malaria, the climate is decidedly healthy, and altogether the most agreeable in Western Asia. It now remains to notice the prevailing temperature of the rest of the peninsula, or that of the principal division. This as has been seen, occupies the space between the two preced- ing tracts, and thus connects them geographically; but it differs from them in the degrees of heat and cold to which it is subject, being in general much greater. Within the limits of Taurus, eastward of the Halys, are the productive regions of Pontus and Cappadocia, which, althoughCHAP. XVI.] CLIMATE OF THE CENTRAL UPLANDS. 361 cold from their elevation, enjoy a fine and moderate climate. Mildness of more especially in the plains and valleys described in the PontU8 - Xllth Chapter. But on the other side of this river a marked change is experienced. The bare plains of Galatia and Cen tral Phrygia are succeeded by the woodless Axylus, 1 and the cold and bare Lycaonia. 8 These tracts have an ordinary ele vation, which varies between 2250 feet above the sea at Kulah, 3 to 3000 feet in the Iflani of Za'faran Boli, 4 and amounts to about 4000 feet at the plains of Podalia and the corn dis trict between Lycia and Caria. 5 Being for the most part with out timber, and scantily supplied with the necessary verdure to assist in preserving moisture during summer, the surface becomes parched by the extreme heat of the latter season. Large portions of the country, especially the districts near Katakekaumene, are now, as in ancient times, exposed to fre quent earthquakes, 6 one of which convulsions desolated Kai- sariyeh in August, 1836. Towards autumn another change is experienced, and the table-land in question is deluged with torrents of rain, soon after the cessation of which it is covered with snow, as the harbinger of a severe and lengthened winter. The elevation and the exposure of the surface on these Extremes of upland plains readily account for that extreme temperature fn the nd 0014 which so greatly contracts the periods most suitable for the u P laild8 - exploratory journeys of the traveller and the agricultural occupations of the people. To the former, such rapid changes cannot be otherwise than extremely dangerous, since they are accompanied by every shade of temperature, from the severe cold at night to the powerful noon-day heat; but time has at length enabled the natives to withstand their effects.

XVI. the pasture is almost burnt up by the approaching hot season, the Kurds,, Turkomans, &amp;c., remove to the elevated valleys in the mountains, and there remain till the cold weather enables them to resume their former localities, which usually are at no great distance, although on some occasions they take their flocks to a milder tract within the limits of Syria or Meso potamia. The animals differ but little from those of Persia and Meso potamia; but the buffalo, which is found in a wild state towards the shores of the Black Sea, is one exception, and the Angora goat, whose beautiful silky hair is the effect of climate rather than peculiarity of breed, is another. Bears, wolves, jackalls, squirrels, and the kaplan or hunting tiger are more numerous, as are serpents and scorpions; but, on the other hand, the hyeena and the lion are seldom found. The Taurus abounds with birds of prey, especially eagles and vultures ; and one kind of the latter exceeds the condor in size. 1 Amongst the birds may be noticed our magpie and the hooded crow ; 2 also the woodpecker, the bee-eater, the black and white heron, wild geese, ducks, teals, widgeons, and coots; the black and common ibis, 3 the common and blue jay or roller, the aigrette, the flamingo, the francolin, and different kinds of bustards; the little owl, and the Indian owl; 4 the desert, the black, the grey, the red-legged, and a still larger partridge, not yet described; also nightingales in countless numbers; and, finally, the Aleppo plover, 5 a remarkable bird with a spur to its wing, which is also found near the banks of the Nile. The fields of Asia Minor suffer comparatively little from that scourge of the East—the locust; but to the entomologist and herpetologist the country would in other respects furnish a rich and almost untrodden field. Serpents are common; and leeches are taken in such numbers as to be one of the principal articles of commerce. Sea and river fish likewise abound; and the latter, as well as the trionyx 3 Vultur Cinereus, Linn. 2 Corvus Cornix. 6 S f ra - 4 Athena Indica, Gould.

The palm is seen occasionally ; but this and other tropical Fruits, fruits do not arrive here at the same perfection as they attain at a short distance southward. The pistachio, the quince, and the carob or locust-tree 1 flourish; and the rest of the vegetable productions are nearly the same as those of Southern Europe, but are more perfect. Of trees may be noticed the spreading cypress 2 (Arbor Trees and vitse), the stone pine (Pinus pinea), the wild pear, the Judas-tree shrubs ' (Cercis siliquastrum), the Siberian crab, and the carob or St. John's head (Ceratonia siliqua). The chestnut and the wal nut are usually of large growth ; the oriental plane, as well as the beech, attains an extraordinary size; and the like may be said of many shrubs, such as the olive, bay-laurel, oleander, myrtle, and heath,—the last being almost a tree. In some parts of the country wild vines cluster over the trees, beneath which there is a thicket of wild lavender, lilac, and white cistus, rising to the height of 4 or 5 feet. Elsewhere tracts are covered with the flowering acacia, the arbutus (Arbutus unedo), and rhododendron, all in the greatest perfection. The chief products are silver, copper, iron, lead, and alum; J i r e oduc ^ t ons of fine figs, grapes, and other fruits; grain; silk, cotton, hemp, and hemp-seed; flax, tobacco, opium, saffron ; madder, mastic, and other gums; galls, yellow berries, sheep's wool, goat's hair, skins, hides, leeches, sponges, wax, honey, salt, and some wine. The people of the country are employed in weaving tents. Employments hair-bags, and the celebrated carpets; in the preparation of otthepeople- various kinds of leather, and the manufacture of culinary utensils. These furnish the means of carrying on a domestic trade, and likewise afford ample returns for the purchase of British and other manufactured goods; but the commerce is trifling compared with that which might be prosecuted in a country occupying the most favourable position possible, hav ing extensive lines of sea-coast, along which are chains of 1 Ceratonia siliqua. 2 A variety of the Cupressus serapervirens. 3 A 2364 COMMERCIAL ROUTES.

Again, a route strikes into the interior from the harbour of Kelendri, passing through Mout and Koniyeh; and a little further there is another going northward from the well-known commercial port of Adaliah, through the JaTafd' 7 ™ 0pium districts ' t0 Kutahiyah. At this place the routes from Smyrna, and other points on the western coast, meet that of Constantinople, and proceed eastward through Angora to Sivas. By means of a military road through Amasiyah and Tokat, Sivas has the advantage of receiving goods in 17 days from the port of Samsun; and likewise of commanding open ings into Armenia, Persia, Kurdistan, Syria, and Mesopotamia. The first of these routes takes an east-north-easterly direction to Erz-Rum, where it meets the ancient and now important line from Tarabuzun, and afterwards proceeds by Bayazid Khoii and Tabriz into the heart of Persia. The next, south ward, passes through Divrfgi to Mush, Van, &amp;c.: the third is that which runs towards Syria and Arabia, and which has already been noticed; and the fourth keeps nearly a south easterly direction, by Malatfyah, Diyar Bekr, Mardin, Mosul, and Baghdad to Basrah. The last only requires a good road, with a little encouragement in other respects, to become im portant to our commerce, since along it, there is a succession of large towns m a tract of country which, in addition to its many natural resources, has the advantage of a steam communica tion at one extremity with India, and at the other with Eu r C from f ur T : the iril P orts from the latter to the interior, through kamsun, in the course of 4 months, in 1888, were 2480 packages, and the returns were 4850 packages of goods for shipment. 1 Tarabuzun, however, promises to be the success- phicaUournar' 8 &amp;C '' VoL X&gt; Part IIL ' 443 &gt; ° f the Royal Geogra-CHAP, XVI.] COMMERCIAL OBJECTS. 365 ful rival of Sivas, especially in summer, when the journey into Persia from that port is shorter by many days, and the goods passing in that direction have in consequence increased from 5000 bales in 1830 to nearly 20,000 in 1834. 1 Nor are the advantages of the Persian Gulf less apparent, the route from thence to Mosul, by way of Mush, Bitlis, Se'rt, and Jezireh, being accomplished in 22 days, whereas 27 days are consumed between Samsun and that city : from Mosul there is a water transport by rafts to Baghdad, and by boats from the latter city to Basrah. When the peninsula constituted a province of ancient The trade Persia it was divided into 5 districts, which yielded about one- by seventh of the revenue of the empire; but although its resources are greatly diminished since those days, the produc tions already enumerated would afford a full equivalent for the imports. These are at present chiefly confined to coifee, sugar, spices, cutlery, British yarns, cloths, muslin, and printed goods; but the heavy taxes which are exacted on European as well as Asiatic imports, added to the still more ruinous system of farming monopolies on almost every branch of indus try, seriously diminish the trade of the country. Meat, oil, fruits, soap, tobacco, coffee, salt, charcoal, and goods,—in short, all the wants of the town's people are taxed by the governor to a degree which, in some places, has much diminished the imports since 1835. The permanent dwellings of the inhabitants are sometimes Dwellings of on the plains, but more generally on the sides of the hills and mountains overlooking the latter, or in wild and secluded rocky valleys; and they are of three kinds. Those in the last situa tions are partly or wholly excavated in the live rock, and usually consist of one or two apartments, closed towards the exterior by an arched wail, through which a supply of light is admitted. Urgub, Sowanll-Dereh, Kirk Hinn, Yarapason, Doghanli Afiyum-Kara-hisar, Gelvedereh, and Tatlar, are specimens of these singular grottoes, which contain dwelling-houses, dove- 1 Mr. Brant's Journey through Asia Minor, &amp;c., Vol. VI.

XVI. cotes, tombs, and chapels. 1 The habitations on the slopes are also partly excavated, and like the Armenian houses, they con sist of two, three, or four apartments, formed with rough logs of timber covered with earth : they are almost deprived of light; and the principal portion of the interior space is allotted to the animals. Description of The Tchiftlik or farm-house of Anadoli consists of a larsre a country i • i r • • i t . . mansion. court-yard with a fountain m the centre : on three of its sides are low buildings, such as stables or sheds for cattle, &amp;c.; and, on the fourth, are raised apartments, constituting the dwelling. A roughly-constructed wooden stair-case leads to a long gal lery or corridor, having a carved and painted ceiling supported by wooden arabesque pillars, beyond which it projects about 18 inches. Opening into this corridor are several rooms, of which the principal is the Salamlik or place appointed for the transaction of business or the reception of guests ; and through out this part of Asia Minor such apartments scarcely differ from one another in plan or furniture. On entering, there is a kind of passage or gallery about 4 feet broad, extending from one side of the room to the other, with its floor on a lower level than that of the rest of the apartment: wooden pannels, with an architrave above, ornament the interior of the wall, and the ceiling is painted. This space is appropriated to the attendants, and to persons of an inferior class who have to make application to the master of the house for advice or relief ; here also the visitors leave their boots, shoes, and outer slip pers, rather than be guilty of the greatest of all breaches of good manners among the Turks, that of soiling the carpets. It likewise contains, on one side, cupboards and recesses in the wall for coffee-cups, bottles, water-jugs, basins, tobacco-pipes, and the instruments for cleaning them ; whilst on the other it is separated from the higher part of the room by a wooden balustrade, through the centre of which there is a passage to the place of honour. The latter is a platform, raised one, or at most two, steps above the floor; it is covered with rich car- Compare Mr. Ainsworth's Travels in Asia Minor, pp. 201-202, 208, &amp;c., with Mr. W. J.

The room is moderately well lighted by two rows of windows; those in the lower row consisting of screens of oiled paper protected by wooden shutters, and those of the upper row being furnished with painted glass. The ceiling and upper part of the walls are painted with ara besque patterns; and below these, between the windows and niches, are displayed the arms, and not unfrequently the orna mented saddles, bridles, &amp;c., of the proprietor. Behind, and usually communicating with the reception- room, are the kitchen and other apartments connected with the har^m; and adjoining the latter is the garden, which, in addition to an abundance of flowers and shrubs, generally con tains a kiosk or summer-house. These small buildings, which are so placed as to command Description a pleasing prospect, are either square or oblong on the plan, hou^ uinmei and the sides are deeply recessed, for the purpose of affording shade at all times. The exterior presents a handsome project ing pagoda-roof, below which are windows, niches, trellis- work, &amp;c., whilst arabesque arches and a painted ceiling, some times representing the early part of the evening, when the moon and stars are faintly seen, constitute the ornaments of the interior. In the milder situations, where it is not necessary to con- Cottages, struct half-sunken houses, those of the peasants are either built of rubble masonry, or they consist of a wooden frame filled up with wattles and clay, or unburnt brick: they rarely exceed 2 rooms; a verandah or rustic portico covers the entrance. The flat roof prevails generally throughout Asia Minor; it is formed of rough beams, with layers of reed or straw across; and above these is a thick coating of clay, which is kept water tight by the occasional use of a stone roller. But in those districts where timber is abundant the cottages are entirely of wood, and each closely resembles an ancient temple, with its portico. 1 1 Mr. Fellowes's Account of Discoveries in Lycia, &amp;c., 1840, p. 129.Edifice for travellers. Tents of the Turkomans. Tents of the Kurds, &amp;c. 368 TENTS OF THE TURKOMANS, YURUKS, ETC. [CHAP. XVI. The number of houses in each village varies from 15 to 50, and the villages being numerous, are usually at short distances from one another: in each the rites of hospitality prescribe that a building be set apart for the use of passing strangers, and this becomes also the usual meeting-place of the inhabi tants. At certain seasons the Turks and Turkomans retire from these dwellings,—the former to other houses in the moun tains, and the latter to tents on such of the lower acclivities as will enable their camels and other flocks to find pasture in the neighbourhood. These moveable habitations are of small size and simple construction, and are not unlike those of the gipseys in Europe: round bell-shaped frames of light wicker- work, covered with carpets or thick felt, serve for the dwelling- places of one portion,—perhaps the primitive branch of this ancient people. But amongst the more civilized Turkomans who frequent the Cilician and the neighbouring plains, a better kind of tent is in use. That of the Beg or Chief is of ample dimensions, and well provided with carpets, cushions, &amp;c.: it contains also a stock of provisions sufficient for the exercise of an indiscri minate hospitality. The tents of the ordinary people are of goats' hair, about 25 feet in diameter, and have several rows of poles, which cause the roof to have the appearance of a number of little black cupolas. The lower part is sometimes closed with bundles of faggots, but more generally by a kind of wall made of reed-mats : an interior separation is also formed of such mats for the use of the women, and for culinary purposes. The black tent of the Kurd and Yuruk is formed of the same material as that of the Turkoman, but it differs from the latter in being of an oblong shape, supported by only two or three poles. Like that of the Arab, it is kept open towards the shaded side in summer, and the sheltered side in winter : when on the move, it is customary with the inmates of the villages composing each particular tribe to remove together, and encamp around their chiefs as they successively occupy suitable tracts along the line of their migration, southward or northward.CHAP. XVI.] KARVANSERAIS. 369 The construction of the houses in the towns of Asia Minor Houses and is almost uniform. The better description have their base- bizars ' ment stories of stone, but the upper part is a wooden frame filled in with clay, or sun-dried bricks, generally flat, but occasionally having a tiled sloping roof, below which may be seen latticed openings through the otherwise dead walls. The monotonous appearance of these places is, however, in some degree relieved by the public buildings, as the bazars, khans, baths, madresehs, and numerous mosques. The long galleries of the first, which are either covered with Arabesque arches in brick-work, or with simple matting, are allotted in portions to saddlers, shoemakers, and other traders, and contain the different kinds of merchandise: and as every transaction, small and great, is carried on in this building, the streets being as it were deserted, the bazar may be said to represent the town itself. The karvanserais take the next place ; and in Asia Minor, Karvanserais. as in other parts of the East, they are almost uniform as to plan,—having a single entrance through double gates into the interior quadrangle, about which are spacious vaulted stables, and numerous double rooms, each pair consisting of an inner and an outer or open apartment. A fountain occupies the centre of the space, and around it, at small distances, the mer chandise is neatly placed in heaps : these edifices are admirably adapted for the commercial dealings of the East, being substan tially built of stone, and admitting of the property being safely deposited within the enclosure during the halt. 1 Turkish khans seldom exceed one story, but those of Persia Khans, generally have two, and are not only larger but finer specimens of architecture. A strong tower at each angle flanks the exterior, and also defends the approaches to the entrance, which is usually through a fine Saracenic gateway. At all the angles, interior staircases lead to the upper story, and also to the top of the building, which is partly covered with small domes, and consists, in part, of a level terrace ; the latter por tion is the usual sleeping-place in warm weather. 1 See Plate XVIII. for the interior of one of these buildings.370 FOUNTAINS, BATHS, AND MOSQUES. [CHAP. XVI. The khans of the East are either constructed by govern ment and let at a fixed rent, or are founded by charitable bequests ; and in either case the expense to the traveller, even at those in the towns, is trifling, whilst at those on the high roads it is almost nominal; the khanji or keeper being con tent with a trifling gratuity in addition to the income which he derives from supplying barley for the animals ; and rice, fowls, milk, charcoal, &amp;c., for persons who desire to purchase them. The distance between these buildings seldom exceeds an ordi nary day's journey with loaded animals ; and it is not unusual to find that, in other places, through the generosity of the Muslims, there have been constructed fountains or cisterns, to which, in case of drought, the inhabitants bring supplies, in order that the traveller may have the comfort of finding water without inconvenience or delay. The object next in estimation among eastern people is the bath. This also is a square substantial stone building, which is covered with one large and several smaller domes ; and like that of the ancients, it has several apartments, which, in suc cession, are of higher degrees of temperature, up to that of vapour. Shampooing, cracking the joints, and the rest of the ceremony being completed, coffee, pipes, and a little sleep, ter minate an every-day luxury, which comes within the means of the poorest individual. The mosques likewise differ but little from one another. A paved court surrounds each, and from it a spacious flight of steps leads to the entrance of the building : within the court is a fountain, and usually a flock of blue Mecca pigeons. A scarlet curtain being removed, the visitor is at once inside of a spacious square apartment, which is either carpeted or matted, according to the season ; and, with the exception of a few sen tences from the Koran, which are inscribed on the walls, the interior is remarkably plain : it is at the same time rather imposing, owing to the effect of the light, which by day is introduced beneath the dome, and at night is reflected by thousands of coloured lamps arranged in festoons. To the finest of these buildings there are four minarehs, which are carried up separately from the ground, and terminate in aCHAP.

A building with two or more minarehs is called a jami', whilst that with a single tower of this description, or none at all, is designated a mesjid. The fixed inhabitants of the peninsula are composed of Turks, Language. Armenians, Greeks, and Jews ; and the nomadic people consist of Turkomans, Kurds, Yuruks, Xebeques, and some Gipseys. The prevailing language, however, is that of the dominant or Turkish section, which has been adopted even by the Greeks. The Armenians and Kurds, however, have preserved their ancient tongues, and the latter speak a dialect of ancient Persia. The Muhammedan is the most general religion; and being Religious at once the basis of the civil as well as the moral law, 1 it seems toleratlon - to influence every act of life ; but most happily it is no longer characterized by that fierce and uncompromising spirit which at one time impelled the followers of the Koran to have recourse to the sword as the means of making converts. Even the desire to increase their numbers by gentle arguments does not now prevail to a great extent among the Muslims; and although here, as elsewhere, complaints of harsh treatment are not wanting, it is certain that the Christians of Asia Minor enjoy in a high degree the blessings of toleration. It may, indeed, be reasonably anticipated that the followers of Muhammed will at length be absorbed in a Christian popula tion, as a natural consequence of the more rapid increase of the latter. Owing to the villages being situated at a distance from the Agriculture, great routes, the traveller frequently passes an extensive tract without seeing more than a few tents dotted here and there over the wide-spreading plains; and he may at first conclude that the rural population of this peninsula consists only of per sons whose occupations are pastoral. Agriculture is not, how ever, by any means neglected; and the supplies in the numerous bazars prove that the husbandman's labour is rewarded by ample returns, whilst the state of the villages shows that the See above, pp. 86, 253. 3 B 2 /372 FOOD, DRESS, ETC.

The women's faces are partially covered, and their hair, which is carefully braided, is much ornamented with gold coins; the rest of their attire is of cambric muslin, and they show more of the person than is customary with the Turkish dames. They live, however, almost as much secluded; and they employ their time in executing fine work, such as embroidered handkerchiefs, nap kins, bags, and purses.

The Armenians, for instance, believe that Christ had but one nature, while the Greeks contend that he had two, and that the Holy Ghost is derived from the Father only: the secular clergy belonging to each of these two sects are permitted to marry once before they are ordained. Like the Roman Catholics, both the Armenians and Greeks have the seven sacraments, and believe in transubstantiation; fasts are also strictly enjoined, not only every Friday, but more par ticularly at four periods of the year ; at such times their food consists of dried or salted fish, olives, and bread ; but during Lent the Armenians are restricted to the two last. A light and active figure in a short Turkish dress, with a Dress of the black turban, distinguishes the Greek 1 from the Armenian, although, like the latter, he wears long moustaches and no beard. The Greek women are less secluded within doors, and less covered without than those of the Armenians; their attire is also lighter and at the same time more ornamented, parti cularly the hair, to which, from their infancy, are appended numerous gold and silver coins of all sizes: they are equally expert in the use of the needle, and, it may be added, they are no less deficient in education. The fishing and coasting trade of the peninsula falls chiefly to the Greeks, who display in it considerable activity, not however without the commission of occasional acts of piracy. In the interior the latter people are shopkeepers or agriculturists; and a mixture of cunning and bad faith characterizes their dealings in each capacity: although naturally quick, and very intelligent, they are neither trusted nor considered trustworthy by the Turks. A taste for bright and gaudy colours prevails among the and of the Kurds of Asia Minor, who wear a flowing, gay-looking, striped turban, with a deep fringe sometimes hanging on one side, but generally down the back.

Household occupations, spinning goats' hair or wool, and making bags, carpets, &amp;c., are the employments of the women. Out of doors their faces are sometimes covered, but this is not the case within : they are passionately fond of dancing and other amusements, which they enjoy in common with the men ; and their fidelity shows that they appreciate the confidence which is reposed in them, character bf The character given of the Kermanj of Assyria 1 is very the Kurds. f rom that which is attributed to the Kurds of Asia Minor, among whom theft and robbery, indifference to their ill-understood religion, the absence of truth, and relentless revenge, extensively prevail.

The figure of the Turkoman is good and athletic, but his countenance is not prepossessing, being broad and flat, with sunken eyes ; his arms are—a lance, a sahre, and a short gun or pistols; horse exercise, smoking, and tending their flocks, are the sole occupations of the men. 1 P. 125.CHAP.

They are brunettes, and are generally ruddy, with expressive countenances; their figures are good, and their per sons are cleanly, without being loaded with ornaments. They have yellow boots, crimson trousers, and a white upper dress of ample dimensions. Some wear a red tarbush, falling towards the front instead of behind, as is the case with that of the men, whilst others braid their black hair in tresses beneath a band formed of Venetian sequins, or other gold coins; and it is usual to have a ring through the left cartilage of the nose.

Nominally they are followers of the Koran; but its precepts and tenets have scarcely reached these wanderers, who are at the same time nearly free from the crimes of theft and depredation. That pride of birth to which the Kurds and others attach such importance is almost unknown among them; and they differ from easterns in general, in giving portions with their daughters, instead of receiving a compensation on the occasion of a marriage. Camels, goats, sheep, and oxen, constitute their wealth : the last are used as beasts of burthen, on which they place panniers to carry their families, and occasionally the large double bags filled with grain, 1 which, as well as their arms and clothes, they purchase; the simple fare already men tioned satisfies their truly primitive wants.

The masters of the country have so much in common with the people above noticed, that they may readily be recognized as an offset from the same stock,—the Turk being the warrior, as the Turkoman may be denominated the shepherd branch. Corruption The former has been pronounced to be ignorant, ferocious, ment govern vain, bigoted, and incapable of civilization; as an inferior, cringing and servile, but overbearing, presumptuous, and tyrannical when in power. From the Sultan himself to the lowest Delibashi the rulers are unrestrained by definite laws, and use the power which they possess to obtain, by the most oppressive exactions, the means of filling their coffers : in general the persons in authority purchase their posts; and being without fixed salaries, while they are liable at any moment to be displaced, they seek only to enrich themselves ; and thus venality and corruption prevail in every department of the government. 1 It is perhaps in a great measure because their prominent failings are not concealed, that so many of the darkest shades of the human character have thus been given to the descend ants of those conquerors whose names belong to the early history of the country. But whilst it is admitted that the people have greatly changed since the formation of the empire, it will probably be found that the 'Osmanli deserves a less unfavourable character than that which has been given to him by some individuals whose opinions are yet entitled to great consideration. theiS 10f Fru g al in his diet, and almost entirely free from the stimu lating effects of wine, or the agitations of European society, the Turk has a well-formed and robust frame, which is pre served in a healthy state by his equable temper, his regular life, and the practice of manly exercises.

On the other hand, it must be owned that he is lamentably deficient in education, from which cause, and the love of ease, which induces him to neglect all exertion, the powers of his mind are not developed. The European is often induced to tax his bodily and mental indolence of powers to the utmost in the hope of enjoying a state of repose the Turks ' at a future day ; but the Turk is content to loll upon his diwan ; to pass the time with his guests, his chibuk, and his coffee, till the appointed time comes round of visiting the mosque, the bath, or the coffee-house, or of repeating his prayers at home. Games of chance being prohibited by the Koran, chess or draughts take their place ; and when surrounded by his friends, he may, after briefly despatching a simple meal, be found listening with deep interest to eastern tales and pro verbs, or else enjoying the amusement of public dancers ; and occasionally also he indulges in the forbidden pleasure of wine or opium.

The generality of tlie Asiatic Turks continue to wear long beards and flowing garments, and to have their heads covered; they also retain the ancient posture in sitting; 1 and they affect the utmost simplicity both in their household furniture and their travelling equipage. The Turkish Of the condition of the women a stranger can have but little opportunity of forming a correct estimate, since the cus tom of excluding the females from the society of men (which belongs to a period long antecedent to Islamism) is strictly followed, even to their absence from public worship in the mosques. But from the attention which the men pay to their help-mates when on a journey, as well as from the privilege which the latter have of meeting together in the baths, the cemeteries, and at country pic-nics, and from their mutual visits to each other s houses, it is clear that a reasonable indul gence is not in reality denied by the husbands, who are said to find that at times the ladies take unfair advantages of the free dom which they enjoy. Polygamy prevails chiefly among the rich, and is quite the exception with persons of the middle and lower classes. 2 In their excursions of pleasure the ladies are enveloped in muslin dresses, and have only a portion of the face uncovered: 3 at home they are employed in knitting, and in executing plain needle-work or embroidery. Charity of the Although of a grave, phlegmatic, and even a listless exterior, the Turk is remarkable for his gentleness towards his children ; and he makes no difference between them and his slaves or other servants. In addition to alms to the widow and the orphan, his generosity is frequently exercised in constructing mosques, khans, and fountains ; trees and burial-grounds are 1 See Plate XV. 2 In 1830 the extensive city of Brusa contained but one individual (the Musellim) 'who had more than one wife. 3 See Plate XVIII.CHAP.

These tombstones are usually beneath the shade of a cypress-tree or a rose-bush. In summing up his character, it may here be observed, that Their Piety, truth, openness, and candour, contentment and entire resigna tion to his lot, are qualities seldom denied by any one to the Turk: his memory is extraordinary, and his judgment is generally sound ; while the safety of travellers, as well as the attention commonly paid to them, sufficiently proves his fidelity and hospitality. Religion, such as it is, being founded upon the Koran, pervades almost every act of his life, and mixes with every occupation. Frequent prayer is universally prac tised, whether the individual be in the bath, the field, the coffee house, or the mosque; and as alms are freely bestowed, abject poverty may be said to be scarcely known in the country. Amongst men of the higher class, the stranger meets with a measured and distant, but a refined manner ; and among all a ready attention to his personal wants ; 1 the chief inconveni ence which he feels while in the country arises from the retardation of his progress, which is caused by the general indolence and procrastinating disposition of the people. At the conquest of the country, the Turks allowed the TheMtan people to retain a number of their ancient customs; and they made the rulers whom they placed over the different provinces nearly independent of one another, as they had been under the reigns of the ancient Persian monarchs. This kind of govern ment exists at the present time, the rulers being, as in Europe 1 On one occasion the writer, returning with an aged Turk and his wife to a small farm, which had just been evacuated by the Russians, the good couple shared with him their dwelling and a little food which had been brought thither, and prepared principally for, their only child.380 GOVERNMENTS OF ASIA MINOR.

XVI. during the middle ages, so many military despots, of whom the Sultan is the chief; and except some few restrictions which have been imposed on him by the Koran, the power of the latter is absolute. Gradation of In a time of danger, the whole of the territory is placed under a great functionary, who takes the title of Vezir of Asia, for whom of late there has been substituted a military commandant called the Anadoli Velessi. Some of the prin cipal governments are intrusted to Dereh Beis (lords of the valley), who are hereditary chieftains : then follow the Pashas of three and of two tails, who govern Eyalets, which contain several Sanjiacs; and next are the Musellims or simple gover nors ; below each of these is the Sanjiac Bei', the A'yan, the Agha, and lastly the Delibashi or simple head of a village. The chiefs are nominated from year to year by the firman of the Porte; each is absolute within his own sphere; and by pos sessing a delegated power, he becomes the representative of the sovereign, and the dispenser of justice. There is, how ever, in each district or town, a court in which, after hearing evidence in its simplest form, justice is administered by a Kadi. Avanias. In theory, now that the civil and military authorities are separated, the administration of the law, and the fiscal regula tions of the Khaliph 'Osman, 1 are nearly perfect; but unfor tunately the former is frequently tainted by bribery, and the latter are disregarded. The most fruitful sources of oppres sion are the avanias or fines, which, under various pretexts, are exacted from the people by way of punishment for supposed offences. But as these fines, like the assessment of the haraj and the land taxes, are levied by means of a local council, composed of the elders of each district or village, the propor tions are justly allotted, and the evils in consequence, though serious, are much less felt than they would otherwise be. Notwithstanding what is thus taken from him, the peasant of Asia Minor still enjoys a fair portion of comfort,—even the calamity of a dearth is lessened by prohibiting the export of 1 See above, p. 254 to 261.CHAP.

That the ancient inhabitants of the peninsula were princi- Ancient pally from Assyria is highly probable, since, in addition to the people ' proofs already stated, 1 we find, from Herodotus, 2 that the JLeuco-Syrians dwelt on the borders of Paphlagonia; and, again, 3 that those of Cappadocia generally were Syrians. The Syrians are also mentioned by Strabo as being near the Halys, and in the vicinity of Amisus ; 4 and it is certain that the reli gion of the Persians prevailed westward as well as eastward of the Halys. Temples of Men Pharnace, or the moon, existed at Zileh and Sebaste; also in Lydia, Phrygia, Persia, and Albania: 5 and the goddess of truth, Anaitis, had a temple at Zileh 6 (where there was held a fete to Sacca). This deity was also worshipped amongst the Armenians, at Acilis^ne, 7 and the Persians,® as well as among the Lydians. 9 The Phrygians, like the Persians, sacrificed to the sun (Mithra), to heaven or Jupiter, and to the earth; 10 they likewise had temples to Belus, Cybele, and Rhea: 11 added to these evidences, we have, in the monumental inscriptions of Lycia, 12 in the style of the architecture, and especially in the so-called Sara cenic arch, as well as in numerous troglodyte habitations of the peninsula, as many marked resemblances to the works of the Assyrians. The observations of Strabo still further con firm the opinion, since he says that the Syrians extended from Babylon to the Issus, and again from the latter place to the shores of the Euxine. 13 The traces of the Hypachsei or Phoe- 1 P. 342 to 344. 2 Lib.

The tract of country at whicli we have now arrived touches Africa on the south, Arabia and part of Mesopotamia on the east, and Asia Minor on the north. It forms, historically as well as geographically, a bond of union between those countries, the connexion in the first respect ascending almost to the time of the deluge: the region has also a particular interest from the circumstance that it is the centre from whence Phoenician commerce and civilization and, at a later »period, the Christian religion was diffused over Europe. Syria, in its most extended signification, the Belad-el-Sham, Extent of or the country on the left, as it is called by the Arabs (such Syiia ' being its situation with respect to Mekkah when looking eastward from thence), has the figure of a trapezium whose base coincides with a portion of Mesopotamia as well as of Asia Minor at the Armenian Gates (in 36 45'30'N.L.), and whose opposite extremity rests upon a corner of Africa as well as Arabia Petrea in 30° 57': its western side is washed by the great sea at Ascalon, in 34°. 30', and it extends eastward from thence till its limits meet Arabia Deserta at Zelebi, in 39° 49' 42'. From this ancient city it runs along the valley of Tadmor, and again south-westward till the Nile separates it from the Continent of Africa. This territory384 THE AMANUS. [CHAP.

Principal fea- One of the most striking features belonging to this re- tures of Syna. country is the long valley which contains the Dead Sea, the river Jordan, and the chain of lakes running northward from thence to the foot of the Taurus. With the exception of a ridge forming a water-shed between the eastern and western streams, nearly in 30° 10' N.L., this singular depression extends along the western side of the country, having on each side, through nearly 6° of latitude, an almost continuous chain of mountains, from which nume rous offsets strike into the interior in difPerent directions. But this chain of mountains, on account of its great eleva tion, the numerous rivers to which it gives rise, the lakes at its base, and the character of the people inhabiting its slopes, is entitled to a detailed notice. Designations, As has been already noticed, the Southern Taurus sends the Amanus. out from the Durdun Tagh, at a point a little westward of Mar'ash, the Alma Tagh or Amanus, which takes a south westerly direction for about 30 miles, and then runs south ward for 18 more ; leaving, as it enters Syria, only the narrow passage of the Armenian Gates 1 between it and the Gulf of Iskenderun. As it advances southward along the coast it bears the name of Jawur Tagh (infidel mountain), and sub sequently that of the Akma Tagh, or more commonly the Beilan mountains. The base of the chain consists of masses of serpentines and diallage rocks rising abruptly from the plains on each side, and supporting a tertiary formation, terminating with bold rugged peaks and conical summits, having at the crest an elevation of 5387 feet. The sides of this mass are occasionally furrowed by rocky fissures, or broken into valleys, between which there is a succession of 1 Strabo, XVI., p. 151; and Leake's Asia Minor, p. 209.chap. xvii.] the mountain passes. 385 rounded shoulders either protruding through forests of pines, oaks, and larches, or diversified by the arbutus, the myrtle, oleander, and other shrubs. Some basalt appears near Ayas, and again, in larger masses at some little distance from the N.E. side of the chain. The latter may be traversed at three different places: the first pass is nearly opposite to the ex tremity of the gulf; and by this it is probable that Darius, after his defeat, fled from the plain of Issus towards the upper pass of the Amanus. The second leads from the plains on the eastern side to the port of Bayas, and, though moun tainous and difficult, this was the ordinary route by which the buffaloes of Muhammed Ali conveyed timber to be em barked for Egypt. The third and easiest has a good roadj which is carried up a moderately-steep ascent for three hours, and then descends still more gradually to the plains on the eastern side. Beilan, a pretty mountain-town of about 400 houses, stands just below the summit of the pass, which is 1584 feet above the Mediterranean, and it has the advantage of being in a healthy situation within 9 miles of the port: the latter may be seen at a short distance from the highest houses. Southward of Beilan the chain becomes remarkable for its Course of the serrated sides and numerous summits, of which the Akma the Bay of Tagh shows about fifteen between that place and the valley Antloch ' of the Orontes. The sharp ridge of diallage rocks, called Jebel Kaiser^k or Rhoms, sweeps to the W.S.W., preserving nearly the same elevation as the preceding part of the chain, till its wooded slopes terminate with the rugged and serrated peaks of Cape Khanzir, which, at an elevation of 5550 feet, overhangs the sea, and separates the Gulf of Tskenderun from the bay of Antioch. Again, a little way further southward the Jebel Musa quits the south-western extremity of the Alma Tagh, and from thence it skirts the northern basin of the Orontes till it terminates above the ruins of the Syro-Mace- donian Seleucia and the excavated slopes of Mons Pieria;—the latter is connected with Cape Khanzir by a line of precipices stretching along the coast. The pine-clad range of Jebel Musa is of limestone, and may be considered as an outlying vol, i.386 ANTI-CASIUS. [CHAP. XVII. portion of Mount Rhoms: it is imperfectly connected with Mount Casius by means of the hills of Jebel Siman ; whilst other groups, also of moderate elevation, but of still greater beauty, connect the principal range with the hilly district of Casiotis: finally, successive groups prolong the eastern slopes of the Amanus to Azas (Kilis), from whence the range proceeds till it ends in the Jebel Balkis above Bir, on the banks of the Euphrates. The principal groups are those of Sheikh Ba- rakat, extending towards the east, and the hills crowned by the towers of Antioch, from each of which an extensive chain may be traced. From the neighbourhood of that city the bold limestone mass of Anti-Casius takes a south-western direction to Bei't-al-Moie (Daphne 1 ), and proceeds onward in the same direction to Jebel Sheiksinah or Ordu Tagh; from whence, as before, it skirts the southern side of the Orontic basin till it ends at the western extremity of the bay of Antioch with the remarkable culminating peak of Mount Casius, which is bounded on its southern and eastern sides by a deep valley celebrated for its fine tobacco. Geological With the exception of some highly crystalline gypsum near Mounfca^ius, its foot on the eastern side, and some diallage rocks, serpen tines, &amp;c., towards the south-eastern extremity, this great mass, like the preceding part of the chain, is entirely composed of supra-cretaceous limestone, rising abruptly from the sea to the height of 5318 feet. 8 This is, however, very different from the height implied in Pliny's remark, that a spectator on the mountain, by simply turning his head from left to right, could see both day and night. 3 In the lower and wooded region, at 400 feet above the sea, is the temple said to have been consecrated by Cronus or Ham on this mountain. 4 The birch and larch trees below are succeeded by thinly- scattered shrubs, but the upper part of the cone is entirely a 1 Strabo, XVI., p. 750. 2 As ascertained by the late Lieutenant Murphy, Royal Engineers. 3 Lib.

From the extensive valley just noticed, an elevated range advances southward ; and from this proceed several trans verse ridges, with a succession of deep valleys and rocky crags, forming that wild and almost uninhabited country which extends from the western extremity of the chain to Ladikeyeh, and onward from thence towards the principal ridge. The latter, under the name of Jebel Kraad, quits the Principal ridge eastern extremity of Anti-Casius a little way beyond Antioch &gt; Casius. and from thence this chalk formation presents a tame rounded outline as it runs SLS.W. along the upper Orontes, forming the water-shed between that river and the Nahr-el-Kebir. On the banks of the latter the chain takes the name of Jebel Nosai'ri or Ausari, and runs southward at the distance of 12 or 15 miles from the coast, passing Kal'at Muzyad, and onward to Kal'at-el-Medik. This part of the chain is much lower than that beyond the ^ a e r 1 '? 1 ' nd Orontes : like the latter, it is chiefly a chalk formation, par- Lebanon, tially covered with pines or oaks, but in general it is but scantily wooded ; and with the exception of its western slopes, on which olives, vines, and the celebrated tobacco of Ladi keyeh are cultivated, it for the most part presents a rounded outline and barren aspect. The Nosairi chain is also of chalk, and its general elevation scarcely exceeds 1000 feet: it is steep towards the Orontes, while on the western side it descends in low irregular hills and vine-clad slopes into the plain of Jebile; by the scarcity of timber, this chain differs much from the hills northward of the Orontes. In its onward course the Jebel-el-Gharbi, or the western mountain of the Arabs, becomes better known as Jebel Libnan or Mount Lebanon, and is of a lofty character; its principal peaks are Jebel Akkar, Jebel Arneto, and Jebel Makmel. The last is a little way southward of the mountain recess containing the celebrated cedars, which in this sheltered spot, and in a few other places only, have attained an extraordinary size: it in general should be observed, however, that although indige nous to the soil, the cedars scarcely exceed the size of mere388 VALLEY OF THE ORONTES. [CHAP. XVII. shrubs. The course of the chain from hence is rather west of south as far as the country of the Druses, and it shows at intervals the elevated peaks of Jebel Sanin, Jebel Rhuan, and Jebel Baruk. It is almost entirely composed of masses oi limestone, rising abruptly from the valley of Zahle and Baal- bec, or Coele-Syria on the eastern side, whilst on the western there is a succession of lower mountains forming wooded basins and rich valleys, which extend from thence to the sea- coast northward of Beirout. As the crests of this part of the great range are covered with perpetual snow, they must have an elevation of more than 7000 feet: on their steep sides are forests of pines, oaks, and other timber, while at intervals are plantations of mulberries ; and grain is cultivated on a succession of narrow terraces supported by stone walls. In certain places these little gardens completely encircle the mountain basins for which this part of the country is so re markable, giving to them, in consequence, the appearance of gigantic amphitheatres, of which the scattered flat-roofed cottages seem to form separations between successive rows of seats. Rich and varied scenery of this kind interspersed with convents, vineyards, villages and towns, prevails on the western slopes of the principal chain (Jebel-el-Drus), which inclines rather west of south, keeping usually at the distance of 12 or 15 miles from the coast, till, a little way south of Kal'at-esh- shukifj it is broken by the Nahr Kasimiyeh or Leontes. The valley of the U pper Orontes is confined on the eastern side by a range similar and parallel to that which has been followed along its western limits. A chalk formation, being the continuation of Mount St. Simeon, or Sheikh Barakat, skirts it in a south-westerly direction as far as the picturesque town of Edlip, which has been thought to resemble Athens, 1 and proceeds from thence to Jisr Shuger. Eastward of the latter place commences the stony platform of Rei'ha, whose eastern side is broken into wide and rocky valleys, and which connects the former part of the chain with the Atmenas or Upper Shashalu. The Atmenas carries on the line to Kal'at-^U 1 Burckhardt 's Travels in Syria, p. 122. Murray : London, 1822.CHAP. XVII.] ANTI-LEBANON. 389 Medik, and continues along the western side of Hamah till it forms the Anti-Lebanon Mountains nearly opposite to Horns. The preceding portion is but little known, having scarcely been visited: it appears to be of limestone, and presents from the plains near its eastern side a bold and rugged outline. Under the name of the Jebel-es-Sharld (Eastern-Mountain) the A nti-Lebanon, at which we are now arrived, takes a south-westerly course along Coele-Syria, 1 now the valley of Bika, showing, as it runs parallel to the Ijebanon, 2 the peaks of Zibdeni, and again those of Es-Sharki just before the range is broken by the Boghaz; through this opening one of the caravan routes passes from the great valley, and continues from thence nearly in an easterly direction to Damascus. The chain is of limestone, almost continuous, and has a width of about 20 miles, with an elevation at its crest probably ex ceeding 9000 feet. Towards the valley of Baalbec it presents steep acclivities without pasture or trees, and is thinly peopled; but on the opposite side the villages are more numerous, corn is cultivated, and the hills are covered with mulberry plan tations. After a south-westerly prolongation for a short distance Branches of beyond the Wadi, Jebel-es-Sharki sends out two branches libanon' from its western, and soon afterwards a third from its eastern slopes. The smaller of the two former diverges from the Anti-Lebanon in a south-westerly direction, enclosing on one side Rai'shiyah and Hasibiyah, as well as the fertile Wadl-el- Tei'm, in which those rivers are situated, till, with the ex ception of a precipitous gorge on the banks of the Leontes, it unites with the elevated range of Lebanon. Although not by any means lofty, this range forms the water-shed between the last-mentioned river and the streams flowing eastward into the Nahr Hasibiyah ; and is remarkable as it separates the northern valley from that which lies to the south, and through which flows the celebrated Jordan. The basin of this river becomes more distinct as it extends southward; but the hills forming its western limits are much lower, and are less strongly 1 Strabo, XVI., p. 754. * Ibid.gqq the merj arjun. [chap. xvii. marked than those on the opposite side. The prolongation of the western range, from the B6ghaz ) passes in the neighbour- hood of Kalat-ish-Shukif under the name of the Merj Arjun : for some distance it runs along the Leontes, and then quits it in two branches, which are almost parallel to each other, taking as before a south-westerly direction. The eastern and lower of these branches consists of swelling limestone hills, and valleys covered with the prickly oak, 1 occasionally show- in^ basaltic rocks on the eastern side. The higher and more western range of Belad Bshirrii* is undulating and cultivated, having a succession of hill and dale thickly wooded on the western slopes, or towards the sea. The south-western pro longation of this and the preceding range are cut off by a cross-range of a similar description, which, from the coast, about four miles south of Tyre, traverses this part of the country in a south-easterly direction as far as Safet, where it meets the principal range belonging to the western side of the valley. The latter quits the Merj Arjun where the separa tion above mentioned takes place; and from thence it runs southward or parallel to the Nahr Hasibiyah and the lake of El Huleh, passing Keds Kedeh and Kubr Hairan, to Safet. These hills are, for the most part, rounded and tame, and are generally without trees or shrubs; they show at Kadita, as on the shores of the lake of Tabariyeh, dark volcanic stones ; and again at Safet numerous naked volcanic cones. 2 Beyond this town the principal chain becomes less marked, and the groups sent westward from it more numerous but less de fined. In its southern prolongation from Safet, the former, as it approaches the waters of Tabariyeh, sends out the groups of Ish Shagur in a western direction as far as the plains of Acre : and again from the banks of the Jordan, southward of the lake, a double line of groups takes the same direction along Wadi-el-Bireh; of these the most remarkable peaks Mount Tabor, are the wooded limestone cone of Mount Tabor, rising to more than 1000 feet above the plain; that which is called the mountain of precipitation beyond Nazareth; and in a line 1 Biblical Researches in Palestine, &amp;c., by Ed.

This range, Giiboa, and after taking, for a time, a south-westerly direction with an of sTmaria.'' 8 elevation of about 1100 feet above the plain, sends one line of groups towards Samaria, whilst others, also wooded, are pro longed by Jezreel, and onward in a north-westerly direction till they terminate with the shrub-clad Jebel Mar Elyas, or Mount Carmel, which rises to a height of about 1200 feet at the southern extremity of the Bay of Acre. Two parallel ridges, or rather a rocky upland, may be said to prolong the mountains from Gilboa southward to the borders of Arabia Petrea. This mass is frequently broken by longitudinal or transverse valleys; the latter generally tending east and west; and one of these, the Wadi Suleiman, which may be said to divide the mass into two equal portions, runs in the lattter direction nearly in the latitude of Jericho. The northern or higher part of the ridge first shows the groups of Samaria, Jebel-el-Tur (Mount Gerizim), and afterwards Mount Ebal, whose rocky ridges partly enclose the town of Nabulus, and are crowned with ruins at an elevation of about 900 feet above the base. 2 Again, further south, the mountains of Ephraim continue Valley of Merj in the same line till the three parallel ridges of rock and Ib ' the intervening cultivated valleys are broken by the valley above mentioned; which afterwards takes the name of Merj Ibn Omeir, and is prolonged westward to Akir or Ekron. 3 From this place a lower ridge or offset-range curves round to Ludd (Lydda), and from thence it runs northward till it joins the principal range near Samaria; whilst on the eastern side a range of steep bluff hills, nearly of equal elevation, occa sionally pierced by Wadis running eastward, but elsewhere having precipitous flanks, enclose the valley of the Jordan as far as Jericho. Southward of these the hills assume an arid, desolate appearance, which increases as they advance along the western shore of the Dead Sea, towards the extremity of 1 The little Hermon of Dr. Robinson.

XVH. which a triple line of groups are sent south-westward into the desert. Along the sea the chain presents a succession of naked and precipitous cliffs, which rise like walls from the edge of the water, and terminate with rugged summits; hut, as in the valley of the Jordan, the chain is at intervals broken by almost imperceptible Wadis. One of these, the En Nar, terminates where the mountains first touch the Dead Sea; and at about midway towards Jerusalem are the sin gular convent and numerous excavations of Santa Saba. 1 Northward of this extraordinary valley there is a succession of rocky ridges, the most remarkable being that called the Temptation, which may be said to connect the range of Jericho with the peak of Olivet; the latter, with an eleva tion of 2556 feet, 2 marks from a distance the position of the Holy City. North-westward of Jerusalem are the hills of Gibeah, Mispeh, and El Jib, and a succession of other bare ridges, having between them cultivated valleys running S.E. and N.W. as far as Merj Ibn Omeir. Again, southward of the city, undulating ground, partially covered with oak and arbutus, with olive groves and vines, and partly cultivated, connects Mount Sion with the southern and more elevated portion of the upland. The eastern side of the latter termi nates with a rocky range, which, in running southward, almost from Bethlehem to Hebron, is broken by several Wadis, one of which, the El Khulil, runs for some distance from Hebron towards the S.W., having a ridge of hills paral lel to it on the southern, and another on the northern side. The latter is the continuation of three ridges, which, com mencing westward of Bethlehem, and forming the western limits of the upland, run southward till they merge into a single range opposite Hebron; from whence the ridge runs S.W for some distance, and again S.S.E. till it joins the preceding chain on the frontiers of Syria. - The numerous hills enclosing the still fertile valleys of Judea are chiefly of limestone, sometimes in loose masses ' scantily covered with sheep-grass, and presenting the same 1 Plate XXV. s Schubert's Reise, vol.

Reverting to the centre of the territory near the yal- Jebei Keish. ley of Bika, where the mighty chain of the Anti-Lebanon separates after having thus far formed the eastern limits of the northern depression. Here, as already noticed, the easternmost branch quits the slopes of Jebel-ish-Sheikh, or Mount Hermon, 1 from whence the low broad spur of Jebel Kei'sh runs southward nearly parallel to Lakes El Haleh and Tabariyeh; from the last of which it is at intervals prolonged by other groups to those of El Wastiyeh, eastward of the Jordan. The two other ridges run south-westward enclosing Piam of Raishiyah and Hasibiyah as well as the fertile Wadi-el-Teim, in which they are situated. The easternmost of these forms the proper prolongation of the Anti-Lebanon. It is of limestone, furrowed with valleys, and partially wooded, and its crest has an elevation which is usually estimated at 10,000 feet above the sea; it afterwards slopes south-west- ward into the plain north-west of Banias ; this plain is cul tivated, and contains several villages. The remaining ridge takes a more westerly direction as it diverges from Anti- Lebanon above the sea; and after sending its cultivated slopes into the plain north-west of Banias, it is again pro longed southward along the Nahr Hasibiyah and the eastern side of Tabariyeh till it is joined by the Jebel Keish, near the extremity of the latter. From Tabariyeh lake the chain runs in two ridges parallel to the Jordan, and afterwards it skirts the Dead Sea as far as Wadi-el-Ghor, on the borders of Arabia Petrea. Opposite the valley of the Jordan the chain shows m sue- Moun^M at ^ cession the fine bold peaks of Jabel Attarus, Jebel Ajlun » Jordan. Jebel Mo'rad, and Jebel Jelad (Mount Gilead) ; and again, eastward of the sea of Lot, Jebel Hesban, Jebel Madeba, 1 Robinson's Biblical Researches in Palestine, &amp;c., vol.

The latter part of the chain, which runs through Amnion and Moab, is a formation of no great elevation, and for the most part of a rocky, barren, and desolate appearance ; but the former is entirely different. The wooded slopes of this part of the chain command, on one side, striking views not only of the rich valley of the Jordan and the hills enclosing it; but also in the distance the groups around Jerusalem, Nabulus, Tabor, and Safet: those slopes may be contrasted with the park-like scenery of the country lying eastward of Jebel 'Attarus, which, from its commanding position, is pro bably the Nebo of the Scriptures. Head of the As might be expected from the nature of the country, the Orontes. extensive depression lying between the preceding chains of mountains contains the principal water-courses of Syria; in its northern portion are the basin and lakes of the lower Orontes, and in its southern, those of the Jordan. Beginning with the former, the most distant branch of the Orontes has its two sources on the western slopes of the Anti-Lebanon in about 34° 5' N. lat., and about 10 miles N.E. of Baalbec ; from hence they run north-westward, and, uniting as they approach the village of Labweh, the trunk bearing the latter name winds northward for about 10 miles along Coele-Syria till, at the village of Ar-Ras, 1 it falls into the basin of a much more abundant stream. The latter, once called Typhon, 2 but now El-A'si, or the Rebel, bursts at once from the foot of the Anti-Lebanon with a more considerable volume of water than the former, and preserves the same name as it flows northward: it is fed by numerous streams from the slopes of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges nearly in 34° 22' N. lat. One of these, having also the same name, joins it with a considerable body of water, and gives it, for a time, a north-easterly direction ; but on entering the valley of Homs it resumes its northerly course, draining as it ad vances the slopes of Jebel Anzeyri, and forming, as it ap- 1 Mr. Burckhardt Barker's Journey to the Orontes, vol.

The Orontes flows northward from the extremity of Bridge at the latter, passing a mile and a half to the westward of Homs, to which a supply of water is carried by means of a small derivation; it continues to flow northward for some miles, and then makes a great bend, sweeping round the foot of Mount Erbayn, and issuing from between rugged moun tains at Hamah, where it is crossed by a bridge of thirteen arches. 1 After running through this city, it flows north-westward Lake ei Taka. along the rich pasture-valley of El Ghab, passing a few miles westward of Kal'at-el-Medik, and a little beyond, it receives an affluent which, after a short course, enters it on the eastern side. This stream issues from Lake El Taka, which, in addition to the carp contained in it, is remarkable for such an abundance of black fish, from five to eight feet in length, that the fishermen, by throwing their harpoons at random, fill their boats in the course of the night. 2 The main stream now turns northward between the Anzeyri mountains on the west and Jebel-el-Ala, the prolongation of the Armenas, along the eastern side; and it continues to Jisr Sogheir, still preserving, its northern direction, but running slowly, and, owing to marshes and irrigation, con veying a diminished volume of water. On reaching the plain of 'Umk it makes a bold sweep to the north-west and west, as far as Jisr Hadid, receiving an affluent from the mountains above mentioned ; and again, a little lower, another tributary called N ahr-el-Butuyune, which, like the former, has a northerly course. About five miles below the iron bridge, as it is called, the Orontes receives its great northern branch, the Lower Kara Su, a navigable river containing a greater volume of water than the parent stream, which it enters on the northern side after a short course from the Aga Denghis, or White Sea. This remarkable sheet of water occupies the western portion of the extensive plain of 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 143. 8 Ibid., p. 137. 3 E 2396 affluents of the orontes. [chap. xvii.

At the eastern extremity is the river Afrin (probably the Uprenus of the ancients), which also has two sources in the abut ments of the Amanus westward of Kilis; from thence it flows southward, passing a little way to the south of Gindarus, and proceeding in the same direction to Jebel Sheikh Barakat, near which it makes a sweep westward through a fine pasture- country, and finally enters the lake with a body of water which, even in summer, has a width in some places of nearly 200 yards. Two inferior streams flow W.N.W. through the plain of'Umk, and also enter the lake on its eastern side. Its extent and The sheet of water formed by these different affluents has depth. the shape of a parallelogram, which extends west-south-west from the Upper Kara Su for about seven miles to the Lower Kara Su; and again from the foot of the Beilan Mountains eastward for about 20 miles to the Afrin and the other affluents above noticed; but during the seasons of floods it covers a much greater extent. At the western side the lake has a depth of six or eight feet, which is reduced to three or four feet along the three other sides where it is marshy ; it is, however, navigated by the flat boats of the country, which, by the use of poles instead of oars, traverse it in every direction with cargoes of merchandise, and especially fish. The supply of the latter is quite as abundant as that w T hich is obtained from Lake Taka on the Upper Orontes; and the black or cat fish, 1 about two feet long, are so plentiful, that when cured they afford a cheap supply to the whole of the Aleppo Pasha- 1 The Macropleronotus niger.CHAP.

Two men are employed in fishing: one of them poles the canoe to a suitable spot, such as the fall of water under the bridge of Murad Pasha, and the other, by drawing along the bottom a hook attached to a piece of bamboo, takes the fish either by the head or some other part of the body. The Lower Kara Su issues from the south-western extre- The Orontes mity of the lake, and flows through the pasture-grounds with of Antioch? a7 a gentle current for about five miles into the Orontes above Guzel Burj (pretty town) ; this small village is a boat-station, and, as it were, the port of the lake. Six miles below the junction of the northern and southern branches, the trunk of the Orontes forces its way through numerous fish-weirs, and winds among the myrtle-clad hills of Antioch; from whence it flows onward, skirting the richly-picturesque slopes of Daphne. It afterwards makes a tortuous course to the S.W. between steep and wooded hills; its fall here is considerable, and its bed is, in several places, obstructed by rocks. In approaching the sea it receives from the hills around Jebel Sim an, first the Kuchuk Kara Chai, and then the Buyuk Kara Chai, a consider able mountain-stream, whose bed and banks are adorned with the oleander, the arbutus, and other shrubs. Having forced its way through the striking scenery presented at every turn by the rocky slopes at the foot of the hills of St. Simon, the main stream enters the plain of Suweidiyeh, through which it winds along the foot of Mount Casius till it passes over a difficult bar into the spacious bay of Antioch. The distance by land from the shore to the city is only 13|- miles, whilst, by the windings of the river, it is 21 miles, with a fall of 300 feet. If a path were made for horses, and the fish-weirs with some rocks were removed, the river would be navigable for track-boats as far as, and even beyond the capital. The flooding of the Orontes depends almost entirely upon its floods, the rains which commence towards the beginning of the month of November; from which time, till the snow falls in the early part of January, there is a gradual and tolerably regular increase; the river afterwards diminishes till a change' is caused by the melting of the snow in April; in which, and398 THE LEONTES. [CHAP. XVII. the following month, the river is at the highest; it then falls till November. At times, the floodings are sudden and con siderable ; but, in general, owing to the basins formed by the lakes and marshes on the southern, as well as the northern branch, the changes are gradual and regular throughout the year. Course of the The next stream to be noticed is the Nahr-el-Litani, or Le- Leoutes to the 0Iltegj sourC e is in the same valley, at no great distance from those of the Southern Orontes, but it takes an opposite di rection. At a spot scarcely 6 miles S.W. of Baalbec it issues from a small lake near Tel Hushben, 1 and from thence it flows southward along the centre of the fertile valley of the Bika, receiving from the slopes of the Lebanon and Anti- Lebanon many streams, the largest of which comes into it from Jebel Sanin, a part of the former range. In its subse quent course the Litani passes a few miles eastward of Zahle, and then proceeds south-westward to join Temir, where it sweeps to the S.E., and after a time again south-westward, through the narrow and fertile valley lying between Jebel Drus on the one side, and the Jebel Arbel, or the westernmost spur of Jebel-ish-Sheikh, on the other. Towards the extremity of the latter, and near the southern extremity of Wadi Bika, in about 33° 27' N. lat., the river, now bearing the name of the Nahr-el-Kasimiyeh, makes a bold sweep to the west, and forces its way through the Lebanon Chain, passing in the first instance along a wild precipitous gorge, 2 over which there is a wooden bridge of one arch (Jisr Bughu), just op posite to Kalat ish-Shukif. Here the river has a width equal to about one-third of that of the Jordan above Tabanyeh, with a considerable depth; and having traversed the Lebanon range it flows for a time to the south-west; it then turns to the west with many windings, and ultimately passes through a broad tract of meadow-land and cotton plantations into the sea, at a point nearly 5 miles north of Tyre. 3 slope of the That the slope of the country itself is now towards the country. ^ 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, &amp;c., p. 10.

The chain of lakes formed along the stream become so many recipient basins for its superabundant waters during the season of floods, and they afterwards afford the means of regulating its decrease. The most northern branch of this river has its springs at Northern the western foot of Jebel-ish-Sheikh, about a mile westward Jordan ofthe of the town of Hasibiyah; from whence, bearing the name of that town, it flows rather westward of south, along Wadi-el- Teim. Subsequently it passes about 4 miles to the west of Banias, and it continues winding through the plain till after a course of about 25 miles it enters the Bahr-el-Huleh through an extensive marsh, having previously received from the Merj Arjun a stream called the Nahr-el-Khurah. The estuary of the Nahr Hasibiyah, properly the head-waters of the Jordan, is at the northern extremity of the lake, close to the termina tion of a shorter and more abundant river, which is formed by the junction of two branches. The eastern, which is also the more distant of these, has two springs which immediately unite at the foot of Tel-el-Kadi, about 4 miles west-north- west of Banias; from whence, under the name of the river Dhan and the lesser Jordan, it flows southward into the Hulet-el-Banias, in which it is joined by the western branch. The latter which has generally been considered to be the Jordan, though the Dhan and Hasibiyah rivers are of greater extent, bursts at once as a copious stream from a cavern at the foot of a precipitous rock, 3 miles southward of Lake Phiala, from whence, according to the people, it comes by a subter raneous passage. After washing the northern side of the village, the Nahr-el-Banias takes a south-west direction, through a volcanic country covered with shrubs, into the Ardh-el-Banias, along which, after joining the western affluent, it flows onward through pasture-ground and marshes; and eventually falls into the lake. The waters of Merom 1 seem to have preserved the extent assigned to them by Josephus, 2 1 Joshua, db. xi., ver. 5. * Lake Samochonites, 1 miles long, and 3|- wide.400 COURSE OF THE JORDAN. [CHAP.

Marshes, teem ing with aquatic birds of all kinds, nearly surround the lake ; to these succeed, on the western side, a well-peopled tract of undulating ground, and beyond the latter are the chains of wooded mountains which form the limits of the valley on both sides; these gradually approach each other till, at its southern extremity, the basin is narrowed almost to the width of the Jordan. Continuation On quitting the lake, the river Urdun or Jordan 1 flows o ie nver. south-westward, with a rapid current in a narrow bed, as far as Jisr Beni Yakoub, 2 where it has a width of about 80 feet, with a depth of 4 feet. Below the bridge it takes the name of Sheri'at-el-Kelbi'a, or the great watering-place ; and here it becomes more sluggish, receiving, as it flows through the Ardh Asiferah, several affluents from the slopes of the moun tains of Safet: after winding for about 10 miles from the last-mentioned lake through a valley varying in width from two to three miles, it separates the western mountains from the rich tract of Batihah on the east; and its waters again spreading out, form a second and more considerable lake. The Sea of The Sea of Gennesereth occupies the mountain-basin formed within the sweep made by the two great chains as they run southward. It has the shape of an irregular oval, whose ex treme length from north to south is about 12 miles, and its greatest width near Tabariyah is upwards of 5 miles. It is everywhere surrounded by a chain of rocky, bare, and brown- coloured mountains, which throughout its circumference rise abruptly from the borders of the lake almost to equal heights. Although such a woodless belt must of itself be devoid of anything picturesque, yet, when contrasted with the deep tint of the placid lake and the depth of its volcanic basin, a very pleasing effect is produced, and the view of the lake from the castle of Tiberias is decidedly striking.

The river, which is wide and fordable, Jordan • makes a tortuous curve along the foot of the western hills for nearly 5 miles, when it receives the Sheriat-el-Mandhour, the Hieromiace of the Greeks, and Jasmuth of the Arabs 1 and Israelites, Joshua, ch. xv., v. 35. This stream is formed by the union of several branches in the Gaulonitis ; from whence the trunk flows westward, passing near Omm Kais, (Gadara), and afterwards through a succession of wild and wooded valleys till it reaches the main stream: there the latter, to distinguish it from its affluent, becomes known as the Sheriat-el-Kiber as it flows through a rich wooded valley at a lower level than the rest of El Ghor. It inclines rather west of south as far as the ford of Beisan, where it has a width of 140 feet, 2 and is 3 feet deep. 3 In approaching Beisan, and also after having passed that The Jordan place, the stream tends towards the eastern side of El Ghor, Dead sea. which here has a width of about 6 miles, and it has in many places a luxuriant growth of wild herbage; but the rest of the space betwen the western range and the wooded slopes of that which borders the Decapolis, presents for the most part a parched soil, with some trees and a few spots cultivated by the Bedawins. 4 At about 5 miles below Beisari, the Jordan inclines towards the western side of the valley; and after wards it preserves nearly a middle course between the upper and lower banks which enclose its waters, the former during the high, and the other during the low season: it then flows along the Wadi Ghor as far as the ford El Keln, below Jericho. In the remainder of its course the Jordan flows along the eastern side of the plain, passing through a bed of willows, reeds, and shrubs, and along a desert tract covered with a nitrous crackling crust. This dark-coloured rapid river daily adds about six millions and ninety thousand tons of water 5 to the Dead Sea : the Arnon and other streams fall 1 Edrisi, p. 338, Ed.

But the green waters now occupying the place of a territory which once, for its fertility, was compared to the 'Garden of the Lord:' 1 the deep and precipitous valleys, and the masses of bare and shat tered rocks, together with the solitude which prevails, render this region one of the wildest on the face of the earth. Lake Asphaltites is only a part of the Wadi-el-Ghor : it does not spread into an oval shape like that of Tiberias; and except at each extremity, where it forms a kind of bay, it preserves nearly a width of 9 miles throughout an extent of about 39 miles from north to south. 2 These are less than the dimen sions given by two ancient writers, 3 and more than those of Strabo, 4 but in the bay which the Jordan enters, the width scarcely exceeds 3 miles ; it is, however, as has been observed by this geographer, very deep; for, according to a recent ex amination, the soundings in many places give more than 300 fathoms : 5 at the southern extremity it becomes shallow, with the appearance of an ordinary lake, into which a sort of flat broad peninsula projects from the eastern side, having at its extremity a ford which is occasionally used by the Arabs in passing from Kerek to the western shore near Wadi-es- Seiqul. 6 The long winding bay alluded to sweeps round from the peninsula to the southern extremity of the Dead 1 Gen. xiii. ver. 10. 2 Biblical Researches in Palestine, &amp;c., by Edward Robinson, D.D. s Diodorus Siculus, lib.

It bubbles up from the bottom and collects on the surface of the water, generally in small quantities, which find their way to the shore ; but occasionally it forms a large mass like an island; and this, being discovered, is speedily broken up and sold by the Arabs, 4 as it was in ancient times, when it produced a considerable revenue. 5 The evaporation from a body of water which for seven or Great evapom- eight months is exposed to a burning sun, concentrating its 10n - rays on a basin of naked rock, must be very great; and at times its sombre-looking exhalations have the appearance of water spouts. 6 The Wadis contain the Seyal, which produces gum Arabic, 7 the semr, 8 the thorny nubk or sidr, 9 the tama- 1 Travels of Irby and Mangles, p. 452. 8 Biblical Researches, &amp;c., vol.

There are birds also, which, con trary to the received opinion, are seen flying over the sea ; 4 and in former times, according to Edrisi, boats appear to have been in use to transport fruit and vegetables from side to side of lake Za'ra. This, he adds, was also called the lake of Sodom and Gomorrah, from the cities of the people of Lot, which, having been submerged by the will of God, their sites are now oc cupied by the fetid waters of the Dead Sea. By another writer it is stated that fire destroyed the obstinate Tha- mudites for not listening to the warnings of a messenger sent from heaven ; 5 whilst others say that bituminous flames de stroyed the rebellious sons of the giant Ad, 6 or Nimrud. But whatever variety there may be in opinion as to the cause, almost all writers, whether sacred or profane, agree in at tributing the catastrophe to the guilt of the inhabitants. Like many other bodies of salt water, it is without any out let, and it is remarkable from being about 1446 feet below the Red Sea. 7 The relative heights of the basin of the Jordan and Red Sea make it impossible that the waters of the former 1 Travels of Irby and Mangles, pp. 354, 355. 8 Twelve or fifteen feet high, witH a trunk of two or more feet in diameter.

The tion with the Bamian source of the river is said to be on a higher level than that sea; and therefore it is not impossible that before, by the sinking of the land, the present basin was formed, a river might have found its way southward to the gulf of Akabah. We have not had such regular observations as would enable us to judge of the state of the Jordan through out the year; but from those which have been made at intervals, it appears that the river continues low during the winter, and, like the Euphrates, begins to increase towards the spring. The change becomes very perceptible during the month of March; 1 in April there is a further increase, and it is, probably, at the highest, as in the time of the Ex odus, during harvest, or about the middle of May, 2 when it is augmented by the melting of the snow in the Leba non. At this season the waters find space in lake Haleh as well as in the basins of Tiberias and the Dead Sea; from the last of which, in particular, a great evaporation taking place, the excess is, in part, carried off, and the overflowing of the Jordan is rendered much less than it would other wise be. » Messrs.

Its surface contains about 7372 square miles, or is rather less than that of the kingdom of the Netherlands. Mountains. The western side is very mountainous, being traversed from north to south by the elevated range of the Amanus, and in an eastern direction by its diverging branches. Towards the centre other offsets run southward from the Taurus to the neighbourhood of Kills, where they consist of trap andCHAP. XVIII.] SURFACE OF THE COUNTRY. 407 basalt. From hence, a limestone ridge, the Lelin-Tagh, extends in a south-westerly direction by A'zaz to the culmina ting point of Sheik Barakat, and onward as far as the district of Armanas, sending off to the west the Anguli-Tagh, which ultimately flanks the valley of the Orontes to the east. Again, more eastward, undulating hills separate the rich and exten sive plain of Aleppo from the almost unoccupied country which, with the exceptions of Jebel-el-Has, Jebel-el-Amri, and the triple range of Jebel Dana Tagh, stretching south ward of Munbedj, consists of a level sheep-tract extending from thence to the right bank of the Euphrates. In general the soil throughout the Pashalik of Aleppo is The soil, excellent, and its climate so good that it has been compared by Dr. Heifer to that of southern Austria; but although ad mitting of a fourth variety, the temperatures to which it is subject will be found to correspond to one or another of the three natural subdivisions of the territory: these last are dis tinctly marked by their structure, their aspect, their elevation, and their animal as well as their vegetable productions. The first of the zones or belts contains the warm districts and features of stretching along the eastern and western slopes of the Amanus. The former portion comprises the level tracts lying along the lower part of the southern Orontes, together with those of the ancient Campus Martius, and the extensive plain of 'Umk, which surrounds the lake of Antioch, and is entirely composed of lacustrine deposits at an elevation of 305 feet above the Mediterranean Sea. The ridges and higher ground along the valleys of the Yagra, the Afrin, the Kara Su, &amp;c., are occupied by the stone-built hamlets of the Kurds and some few Turkoman villages; the level tracts, which are also without towns, being partly covered with impenetrable beds of gigantic thistles rising to the height of 10 or 12 feet, and partly occupied by the Turkomans, whose camps and flocks extend for some distance round Murad Pasha. The remainder of the territory, which includes the classic ground bordering upon the shores of the Mediterra nean may be considered as divided into two portions by the remarkable headland of Ras-el-Khanzir.

The bay has a width of 18 miles and a half at the entrance, and from thence the inlet, which is capable of containing all the fleets of Europe, extends 37 miles to the north-eastward; it gradually diminishes, how ever, in width till it terminates near the Kara Kapu (black gates), which separate Cilicia from the portion of Syria lying along the western slopes of Amanus. piaiu near the With the exceptions of some broken ground towards the Mediterranean, anc [ the ridge of hills five miles northward of Iskende- run, through which is the pass of Sakal-tutan (Jonas' pillars), the narrow district here spoken of forms a continuous plain of rich light soil, extending from the southward to the Jebel Rhosus, 1 which rises abruptly from the sea. It is thinly dotted with Turkoman villages, which are pleasantly situated amidst fine walnut trees, wild vines, orange groves, and culti vation ; the rest is pasture land, with occasionally marshes, as at Iskenderun, Two branches About seven miles south-eastward from the borders of ChaTriver! Syria are the remains of a considerable city, probably those of Issus or Nicopolis, with the ruins of a temple, a part of the Acropolis, an extensive aqueduct generally with a double row of arches, running E.S.E. and W.N.W. These, in addition to the walls of the city itself, are entirely built of lava, and still exist in considerable perfection. Nearly 14 miles south ward from thence, the Deli Chai' quits the foot of the Amanus in two branches, which, after traversing the Issic plain, unite at the foot of the mountain just previously to entering the sea. The principal of these branches makes a deep curve towards the N.E., so that a body of troops occupying one side might see behind and outflank those posted on the op posite side ; 8 in which, as well as in other respects, the stream appears to answer to the Pinarus of Alexander's historians. A little southward of this river are the castle, khan, bazar, 1 Strabo, XVI., p. 751. * Arrian's History of Alexander's Expedition, by Mr. Rooke, vol. I., p. 80. London, 1814.CHAP.

Again, five miles southward is the pass above noticed of Sukal-tutan, and at nearly the same distance onward the fine bay and anchorage of Iskenderun, with an open but convenient landing-place on a bold beach; but, in consequence of the accumulation of the sand by which the mouths of the streams descending from this part of the Amanus are choked, a pestilential swamp extends from the very edge of the sea almost to the foot of the mountain. In the marsh towards the latter are some trifling ruins, which may possibly be the site of ancient Myriandrus; and within a mile of the shore are the remains of a castle and bridge constructed by Godfrey of Bouillon. There is, however, but little to mark the site of Alexander s commercial city; but there are several buildings which served for stores at the period when this was the most flourishing of all the landing-places in the Levant. The success of the small cut made by Mr. Martinelli, in 1833 and 1834, sufii- ciently proves that a trifling outlay, including the use of a small machine, would make the place comparatively healthy; and, in addition to the advantages to be derived from drain ing the marshes, there would be obtained access to the town of Beilan at the distance of eight or nine miles from the shore. This prettily situated and healthy town, which was at one time celebrated for its gold embroidery and saddlery, is now reduced to about 700 half-ruined houses, which occupy 1 Re™™* 'ear both sides of an elevated gorge, having the two portions con nected by a bridge. Near the town are the remains of two aqueducts, and a part of the Roman road between Chalcis and the sea. The tract lying to the westward is a mere strip, which stretches from Iskenderun along the lowest slopes of the wooded range of Mount Rhosus, passing by Karatch, Arsus, and the village of Karousein to Cape Khanzir. It is thinly peopled by Turkish and Greek peasants, who are but 1 Pocock thinks this is the Pictanus of the Jerusalem Itinerary .—Description of the East, p. 174, vol. II. VOL.

At nine miles from the extremity of the gulf the village of Arsds marks the site of ancient Rhosus; it contains about 50 mud houses built along the banks of a small river, 1 amidst the remains of walls, arches, and a Corinthian temple. 2 Boundary line The remainder of the coast is the bay of Antioch, or the pfsSs 1 of entering in of Hamath, 3 of which Cape Khanzir forms the Tripoli. and northern, and the slopes of Mount Casius at Ras-el-Basit the southern extremity. From hence, the line separating the pashalik from that of Tripoli runs eastward along the northern slopes of Jebel Kraad to Nahr-el-Kebir; from whence it follows the mountains of the Nosairiyehs, first in an easterly and then in a southerly direction, skirting the western side of the Orontes towards Ain-el-Talka; a little short of which place the line strikes eastward across the mountains of Re'iha, 4 and onward along those of Elahas till it includes the town of Dei'r and the bank of the Euphrates below that place. Within these limits, and about 11 miles S.W. of Aleppo, are the ruins of a castle, and near it a circular basin of about 150 feet in diameter and upwards of 70 feet deep, with grottoes excavated in its sides. It is known by the name of Sunk village, the sunk village; and although probably the crater of an ex tinct volcano, it has quite the appearance of being artificial. Fourteen miles farther in the same direction is the village of Dana, at which are the grottoes, cisterns, sarcophagi, and other remains of the ancient city of that name. Again, 13 hours S.W. by W. from Aleppo is the town of Sermein, which is remarkable for the great number of its cisterns and wells, and for the troglodyte habitations of the poorer peasants. 5 Nearly 10 miles N.W. by W. from thence stands the pictu resque town of Edlip with many similar excavations, and also several Christian remains ; 6 and eight miles south by west of ' Rhosus, built near a river at the foot of Ris-el-Khanzir.—Jaubert's Edrisi, tome VI., p. 132.—Recueil de Voyages. s MS.

The plain of Aleppo is everywhere thickly covered with villages and hamlets, consisting of houses either of stone or sun-dried bricks ; and wood being scarce, they are usually covered with pointed clay-built cupolas, one or more on each building. In the vicinity of each place there is generally one of those conical mounds, from 30 feet to 170 feet high, which have been aptly compared by Colonel Estcourt to giant mole hills, and are among the most remarkable features of this part of Asia. They appear to be the Komata of the ancients, and are at present called Hinks by the Turkomans, and Tells Hinks, or by the Arabs; but opinions are much divided on the ques tion whether they are natural or artificial. Their seemingly regular positions, overlooking towns and villages, give them the appearance of mounds raised for the purpose of defence; but more attentive consideration has led to the conclusion that they are natural, although in many instances they par take of both characters. Mr, Ainsworth observed that these monticules sometimes contain boulders of basaltic and other rocks, which must have been carried in a southern direction from the hills lying to the northward, and deposited in the plain, where they formed the kernel of a rock, around which other materials were gradually piled up. But it is also pro- 1 Burckhardt's Syria, p. 125. 4 Ibid., p. 123. 3 G 2412 THE ANCIENT CHALUS. [CHAP.

TheKow^,or The plain is watered by the river Koweik, which has two sources in the elevated ground southward of Ain-tab; and the larger, owing to the abundance of its fish, has the name of the Baluk Sii (fish river). It is formed by many rivulets descending from the hills between Kilis and the village of Kara Weyaw: after the junction of the streams, the trunk takes an eastern course, and on entering the plain of Aleppo a little beyond Sayyadok-ko'i, 1 it receives the northern branch, which comes from the vicinity of Ain-tab; and soon after wards through a canal constructed by Mr. Vincent Germain of Aleppo, it is augmented by a portion of the waters of Sajur : its elevation, on entering the plain, being about 1263 feet above the level of the sea. its fish. There is but little doubt that this river is the Chalus of Xenophon, 2 since its distance from Beilan is about 68 miles, which, in a mountainous country, would require three long marches, agreeably to the statement made in the work referred to. Another coincidence may be observed in the quantity of fish with which the river abounds : more particularly the Aleppo eel 3 (Simmak Ingliz), the shad 4 (Babuge), and the common loach 5 (Kebudi) ; one of which may have been the representative of the Syrian divinity. 6 This fish is still pre served with much veneration in the pond of Jami' Ibrahim at O'rfah. 7 The small but abundant trunk of the Koweik winds south ward along the shallow bed which it has scooped in the plain of Aleppo, for a direct distance of about 40 miles to Edrisi's description nearly coincides with this account; he says the Koweik rises near the village of Sindb, six miles from Dabec.—Jaubert's Translation, Recueil de Voyages, &amp;c., tome VI., p. 136. 2 Anabasis, lib.

The lake contains a great many small islands, and its surface is literally covered with flamingoes, geese, ducks, and other aquatic birds. In winter time its circumference probably exceeds 50 miles, and at this season its waters are somewhat bitter; but afterwards they gradually dissolve a portion of the concentrated particles of salt with which the bed is impregnated. During the dry season, however, the extent of the water is reduced to less than 30 miles in circumference, while the powerful evapora tion of the summer heat causes it gradually to crystallize, and fine salt is formed in such quantities as to supply a consider- ble part of Syria. Although but a small place, Sphiri is remarkable for its Prosperity of prosperity, and the pleasing contrast it affords when compared p in ' with other Arab villages. The houses are well built of sun- dried bricks, and contain several clean apartments looking into an interior court. The inhabitants have become settled cultivators, and enjoy the advantages of an improved system of husbandry, with better farming implements than they formerly had: these, and the practice of irrigation have been intro duced by the sheikh, who is thus enabled to obtain a succes sion of crops; he has also made a good road, and planted trees on each side in order to afford an agreeable shade. 2 A plain, bearing marks of having formerly been &gt; culti y ate ^'^ c a ? e n s t ^ ulti . extends south -westward from the village of Sphiri to the El vation&gt; Amri range, and in this last are extensive and well-con structed troglodyte habitations ; there is also an ancient i After Aleppo, it passes Kinnisrln, thence to the Merj-el-Ahmar, and is lost in a marsh.— Jaubert's Edrisi, Recueil, &amp;c., tome VI., pp. 135, 13b.

Being distant 12 hours S.S.E. from Aleppo, Colonel Leake is of opinion that Belad Chan Azra may be the an cient Androna; and it is probable that the ruins mentioned by the Arabs to Dr. Heifer, which are six hours farther on towards Palmyra, are those of Seriane.

This stream has its source at a place called Dabb, or Dhahab, near the foot of the hills to the southward of Munbedj : from thence the Nahr-el-Dhahab, or Golden River, probably the Daradax ofXenophon, flows southward, passing by Taidif, and near the fountain of El Bab; after which its course tends a little way westward of Abu Ja'ber. It now inclines S.S.W., and after flowing about 40 miles in this direction, or nearly parallel to the Koweik, its waters are lost in those of lake Jabul (more Lake Sabak- properly Sabakhah, i. e. brackish) a little beyond the village of that name: both the village and the lake are situated in the valley of salt; and the latter having received three short streams near its western extremity, extends from thence east ward for about 12 miles, with a breadth varying from about three to five. Like El Melak, it is celebrated for the quan tity of salt produced, especially after wet seasons; when the salt is collected, it is transported on animals to Jabul, where it is dried, winnowed, and separated into heaps, according to its different qualities.

Ruined castles. Twenty-four miles E.S.E. of the ruins just mentioned, amidst chalk hills and dry valleys, are the mosques, Ziarats, and other ruins of Balis, which extend for a distance of more than two miles, parallel to, and about half a mile from, the bend made at this place by the river Euphrates. The prin cipal buildings are two small castles, apparently of Roman architecture, with a wall 12 feet thick; also the remains of a ditch, some Saracenic arches, and a remarkably fine octagonal tower of three stories, 3 rising from a square base to the height of 75 feet, and having an interior staircase. There are be sides some vestiges of the port or landing-place, at a spot where, at one time, the river washed the northern side of the Barbalissus of the Peutingerian tables; the Balis and port of the Syrians ; 4 and probably the Baalitz or P'thora of Baalim ; 5 which is 53 miles from Aleppo, and the same distance from Kinnisrin.

Towers of which are at the town of Dei'r, 4 and on the slope of a hill Zelebl ' rising abruptly from the right bank of the river, is Halebi or Zelebi. This striking place is fortified with walls and towers which, as well as the public and private buildings, are con structed of fine gypsum. The town has the form of an acute triangle, whose base rests upon the river, whilst its sides ascend the steep acclivity of a conical hill, and terminate on its summit with a small acropolis. As the whole is com pletely seen from the exterior, the necessity of an increased number of flanking towers becomes very apparent: twelve of these works defend the southern side, and eight the northern or shorter side; whilst on that of the river, which is not commanded, they are farther apart. In the town are the remains of a temple, and an extensive palace containing many ornamented apartments; also numerous well-constructed pri vate dwellings, supported by arches; and in general the build ings are so well preserved that the mind can scarcely be brought to feel that all have so long been unoccupied. The city of Zenobia was probably built by the queen of ci &lt;y of that name, and resorted to by her at certain seasons, in order Zenobltl - that she might enjoy the refreshing breezes which are felt along the valley of the Euphrates. It also appears to have been the principal passage leading from Palmyra into Assyria; for, a little below the walls, and opposite the ruined castles of Halebi on the left side, are the remains of an embankment, partly arched with bricks 15 or 16 inches square, but chiefly of solid stone. 1 Strabo, XVI., p. 746. 3 Anabasis, lib.

Necropolis occupies a prominent situation in the valley and along the declivity of the hill westward of the town, and it is remarkable for a number of square towers precisely of the same construction as those near Palmyra. These monuments of mortality usually consist of three stories, the lowest and middle appear to have been tenements of the dead; whilst the upper story served as a place of defence, and terminated either with a flat, or a pyramidal roof surrounded by battlements. In one of these tombs Captain Lynch recently discovered a female mummy whose face was covered with a thin mask of the finest gold, which is to be seen at the India House; and in another tomb is an inscription, which was copied by Mr. Ains worth. 1 ei Ressafa. In this part of Syria, at the distance, according to the Arabs, of four hours southward of A1 Hammam, is the El Ressafa of the Ommiade Khaliphs, 2 which no doubt connected Palmyra with the Zeugma. It is entirely deserted, but cannot be called ruinous; the walls and many of the interior build ings being in an excellent state of preservation. The town displays a mixture of ancient with Saracenic, Muhammedan, and Christian architecture ; the last being of a comparatively late period, since there is a well-built modern Greek Church within the walls. T^rivcr In the western and northern portions of the district are several fine valleys lying along the Kersin, the Sajur, and their affluents. The former river rises in the hills a little way south-west of Rum Kal'ah, and flows southward to the Kurdish village of Kara dash; from thence it proceeds south- south-eastward by that of Rashil, and continues in the same direction between undulating hills; it passes about eight miles westward of the village and Tell of Balkis, on which latter are the ruins of a temple, and at length washes the flourishing and now celebrated Kasabah of Nizil, which contains about 1 / U) AW .

XVIII.] RIVER SAJUR. 419 200 clay-built houses, the remains of a Greek Church, and a ruinous castle overhanging the Kersin. A little below, the latter is crossed by the bridge which leads to Bir, and soon afterwards it receives an affluent coming eastward from the Nizib hills. 1 Except during the rainy season, the Kersin is thus far fordable ; but it is deeper during the remainder of its course, which is eastward, till it falls into the Frat a few miles below Port William. The Sajiir, the next river southward, and a more considerable Course of the stream, runs almost parallel to the Kersin, but with a more S ^ ur lengthened course. The principal branch has two sources, which, after running a short distance along the southern slopes of the Taurus, unite at the eastern side of Ain-tab; and a little way south-eastward it is joined by an affluent coming from the hills westward of the village of Arul. The trunk now flows with a tortuous course along a deep bed between two ranges of hills, for a distance of about 30 miles, to Tell Khalid, a small village situated at the foot of one of the monticules already noticed as being so common in this part of the country. From an oval base of about 300 feet in length by 200 feet in breadth, this remarkable and chiefly artificial Tell rises in the shape of a truncated cone to a height of nearly 174 feet; and on its summit are some trifling remains of the castle which was an object of contest during the wars of Salah-ed-din, 2 and the subsequent invasion of Taimur. Just below the village, the Sajur receives its western affluent, it enters the the Keraskat, which flows into it from the village of Jiljamah, Eu P brates - about 25 miles to the north-west, where it has two sources. Here the Sajur, now a considerable stream suited for boat navigation, makes a bold sweep eastward; and, after running about 12 miles as before, between two ranges of low hills of chalk, it receives a feeder coming south-east from the village of Tell Izan; after which it inclines more southward, and finally forms five short branches and four islands as it enters the Euphrates, 3 near the tent village of Sarasat.

Yet we know that the Syrian city of Ninus Vetus 2 flourished under the name of Bambyce, 3 and subsequently of Hierapoiis, 4 or the Sacred City of the Greeks, 5 and that it contained the rich temple which was plundered by Crassus; 6 finally, it bore the name of Munbedj 7 or Bambuche, and had a succession of sovereigns in the 5th century of the Hijrah. 8 The ancient city was near the eastern extremity of Comagene, or Euphratensis, which had Samosat at the opposite extremity. 9 Some ruined mosques and square Saracenic towers, with 1 Jisr Munbedj, two days from Hdrdn.—Jaubert's Edrisi, p. 155, tome VI., Recueil de Voyages, &amp;c.

Of the smaller, the enclosure and portions of seven columns remain; but it seems to possess little interest, compared with the larger, which may have been that of the Assyrian and Phoenician Astarte, 1 or Astroarche (queen of stars), which afterwards becailie the Syrian Atargatis, 2 or Venus Decerto. 3 Amongst the remains of the latter are some fragments of massive architecture, not unlike the Egyptian, and 11 arches form one side of a square paved court, over which are scat tered the shafts of columns and capitals displaying the lotus. A little way westward of the walls there is an extensive Ancient roads Necropolis, which contains many Turkish, with some Pagan, an(1 a&lt;lueduct Seljukian, and Syriac tombs; the last having some almost illegible inscriptions in the ancient character. From this quarter may be traced the two roads which led to the Zeugmas; also the remains of a Khanat running in the direction of the Sajur, from whence this work, so peculiar to the Assyrians, probably brought a supply of water. East ward of the city is the extensive aqueduct which, at a later period, supplied the town from the range of hills about seven miles to the south-south-east, called Jebel-Dana-Tagh. Two miles southward are the tents of the Beni-Said-Arabs, whose flocks occupy the pasture-grounds which extend from Balis to the Sajur. From this river to Bireh-jik the country is cultivated by fixed Kurds and Turkomans of the Barak tribe. Along the different routes which have been traversed between the latter place and the shores of the Mediterranean, successive villages and hamlets of clay or stone are met with at short intervals, but very few places possess any particular interest. 1 There were temples of this goddess in Palestine.—Jos. Ant., lib. V., c. xiv. 8; at Tyre : ibid.; against Apion, lib. I., s. 19; and atSidon, 1 Kings, c. v., and v. 33. 2 Strabo, XVI., p. 748. 3 Herod., lib.

V., c. xiii. and xxiii. ,422 KIL1S AND A'ZAZ. [CHAP. XVIII. Amongst these, however, may be noticed the ruins near the village of Corus; the latter being situated on the slopes of the Taurus, 1 about 40 miles north by west of Aleppo, or nearly the distance given in the Itinerary; it is probable that the ruins are those of Cyrrhus, the chief town of the ancient Cyrrhestica. Fifteen miles south-east by east from thence, and on the lowest slopes of Taurus, is Kills, the seat of a Turkoman government, whose limits nearly correspond with those of the province just mentioned. The town, which occupies a valley opening southward, and the slopes above it, is of stone, and tolerably well built; it contains an inferior bazar, 23 good mosques, some baths, and about 12,000 inhabitants ; these consisting of Armenians, Turks, Kurds, and Turkomans, but chiefly the last, who are at once agriculturists and carriers; and the site appears to correspond with that of ancient Ciliza, being .32 miles north of Aleppo. Ten miles south-west of the preceding town, and about 26 miles north by west of Aleppo is A'zaz, a Kasabah in three separate portions, containing about 250 badly-built houses partly enclosing a Tell, which is rather larger than the generality of those on the plain of Aleppo. The mound is nearly circular, and partly of lime-stone, with a circumference of about 250 yards at the base, and 90 yards at the top of the cone, which is about 120 feet high; its natural kernel having been increased to this extent in order that the work might be more defensible. As this place appears to represent the Arsace of the Itinerary, the walls on its summit may be the remains of the citadel, which probably occupied this commanding ground, and opposed for a time both the conquests of Salah-ed-din/ and the advance of Taimur Beg; the latter, having got pos session of it, bestowed some care in strengthening its fortifi cations. Previously to its occupation by that chief, it was a fief of the Latins, who had been called in to protect the place against the sultan of Aleppo. 3 Eight miles S.S.W. of A'zaz, and near Basul, are the remains of two ruined convents; and 1 Corus ' built on the side of the Taurus, two days from Munbedj.—Edrisi, tome VI., p. 139.—Recueil de Voyages, &amp;c. 2 Hist, des Huns, tome II., p. 232. 3 Ibid., II., pp. 97, 98.CHAP. XVIII.J CONVENT OF ST. SIMON STYLITES. 423 a little southward, beyond the village, stands the castle of v Bassuet, which was erected to command this part of the deep valley and the passage of the river Afrin: the latter, at this place, is 200 paces broad in the low season. Again, about 10 miles S.S.W. on the northern shoulder of Ruins of the Sheikh Barakat, in a rocky and somewhat dreary situation, st! Simon, and at about two-thirds of the way towards the summit, are the ruins of one of those monastic establishments so frequently met towards the southern extremity of the pashalik. Near a very handsome church, ornamented with Tuscan windows, is the principal part of the Convent of St. Simon Stylites, a quadrangular building, having aisles with double^ arches, and cloisters along two of the sides, and the remains of a handsome but small chapel inside. Nearly a mile and a-half to the northward are other ruins of the same kind; and again two miles southward, a similar pile of buildings constructed, as well as the cisterns, of grey limestone, of which this part of the country is almost entirely composed. Fourteen miles west -north-west of the convent, at about Thermal 400 feet above the level of the Mediterranean, are the three thermal springs 1 and the Turkoman tent-village of A1 1 These are comparatively of recent origin, and appeared after different earthquakes; they vary in temperature, being respectively IT, 98-7, an 99-5°.424 ANCIENT ANTIOCH.

Hammam; and 10 miles onward in the same direction, the Gdl Bashi river and marsh are crossed by a bridge and causeway of 17 arches, 1 which were constructed at Murad Pasha by a vezir of that name, in order that the road might be open during the rainy season, not only from Aleppo to Iskenderun, but also round the Aga Denghiz to Antioch. The Amanus rises abruptly from the western shore of the Aga Denghiz, leaving in certain places only a very narrow strip. Nearly midway between Murad Pasha and Antioch, Khan Karamoot is situated in a strong defile, which is commanded by Kal'-at-Pagras, the strong-hold where the celebrated chieftain Kuchuk Ali was for some time enabled to defy the power of the Sultan ; his supplies being obtained by contributions levied on the passing caravans. Near the opposite side of the great lake are the Kurdish villages occupying the crests of the hills which enclose the Kizil Chai, Chateli Chai', the Kara Su, and the other affluents of the Orontes, already noticed; by these the western side of the pashalik, northward of Antioch, is amply watered. Scarcely a vestige remains of that portion of ancient Antioch which, according to Pliny, 2 must have occupied the northern banks of the Orontes. 3 Walls and square towers of surprising solidity 4 encircled the residence of the Syrian monarchs, the seat of pleasure, the centre of extensive com merce, and the third city of the habitable earth. 5 The south ern portion of Riblatha, 6 or Hamath the Great, 6 occupied a singular and most striking position. This part of the city was bounded on the south-east by a high range of rocky hills, and on the opposite or north-western side, by the valley of the Orontes; whilst deep precipitous valleys formed its north eastern and south-western limits. The walls have a circum ference of nearly seven miles, and form an irregular parallel- Kurdish villages.

The city appears to have covered the plain and the sides of the hills eastward, on the rocky declivities of which are some ancient remains. Amongst these may be noticed a building with a square basement, containing four Saracenic arched entrances; the whole is surmounted by a round tower, probably Norman, rising about 30 feet higher. Again, at no great distance above the gate of St. Paul are the ancient excavations forming part of the church of St. John; and in the vicinity a colossal head, probably that of a Sphinx; also a full-length Egyptian figure, both in bold relief, cut in the solid rock evidently at a very remote period. In a retired spot towards the centre of the mountain ridge are the remains of a circular structure, about 90 feet in diameter, partly excavated in the rock; it is enclosed with a wall four feet high, and is traditionally connected with the Pagan immolations to Jupiter. Near the western extremity of the city a portion of the stPaui's walls has been razed to build the barracks and serai* of Ibrahim Pasha; but from thence along the Orontes to St. Paul's Gate, as well as on the rest of the circumference, the limestone walls and towers are remarkable for their superior construction, vol. i.426 ANCIENT WALLS AND TOWERS. [CHAP. XVIII. The Acropolis For the defence of the lower part of the city no particular of the City. e £p or |- 0 £ gj^ was necessary; hut with respect to the higher, the greatest ingenuity was exercised in securing the weak points at the opposite extremities of its rugged contour. Walls and circular turrets, constructed in different ages, occupy the northern and highest extremity of the range, at the head of a wild ravine; from whence a castellated build ing, once the Acropolis, commands an extensive prospect of the lake of Antioch, and the Beilan mountains, as well as the valley of the Orontes, and of the sea from Jebel-el-Akra to Cape Khanzir. By a bold effort of genius, a wall has been carried from the eastern side of the castle down the almost vertical face of the cliff, and again from thence across the deep valley beneath; beyond this, in a no less extraordinary manner, it is made to ascend the opposite steep hill in a ziz- zag direction; and it is again carried in the same daring manner down the opposite side, till it joins the western walls near St. Paul's Gate. Construction But it was in overcoming the defects of the ground at the of the Towers. , „ , V , , 0 southern extremity of the city that the skill of the Romans is most conspicuous. Owing to the steepness of the declivity, the ordinary platform surmounting the wall here becomes a succession of steps between the towers, which are very near one another, and have a story rising above the wall, to protect the intervening portions from the commanding ground out side. The towers are of uniform construction, about 30 feet square, and project each way so as to defend the interior side, as well as the exterior face of the wall; the latter is from 50 to 60 feet high, and 8 or 10 feet broad at top, which is covered with cut stones terminating in a cornice. The towers are perfectly upright, and have interior stair-cases, and three loop-holed stages resting on brick arches; the uppermost having a stone platform, and a small cistern beneath. Low doors, or rather posterns, afford a passage along the parapet; so that these structures may be regarded as a chain of small castles connected by a curtain, rather than as simple towers. The precipitous valley outside of the wall is crossed by a bridge of five arches, once part of the aqueduct which ex-CHAP.

The modern Antakiyah covers but a small part of the Houses of . in&lt;&gt; - ancient site, the remainder being for the most part occupied with mulberry-groves, vineyards, and fruit-gardens. It con tains several baths, a synagogue, a Muhammedan college, and 14 mosques: the houses are Turkish as to plan, but of inferior construction; usually of stone, though frequently consisting of a wooden frame filled up with sun-dried bricks, and having a pent roof covered with red tiles. Exterior stair-cases lead from a court shaded by orange and pomegranate-trees to corridors and balconies; and the doors and windows of the buildings generally face the west, for the sake of the cool breezes coming from that quarter during the greater part of the summer: the streets are narrow and dirty, being but partially cleansed by a gutter in the centre. The most remarkable gate next to that of St. Paul is Bab- Su- el-Jisr. or Suweidiyeh : l it leads to a Muhammedan bridge of four low arches over the Orontes, which at this spot is but 60 yards wide. On the southern banks are several tan-yards, and both above and below the bridge are several fine Persian wheels, some of which are nearly 60 feet in diameter. Their power in working corn-mills is increased by dams of reed stakes and other light materials, which usually cross the stream above each, in order to raise the water, and at the same time serve the purpose of productive fish weirs. Edrisi describes the buildings of Antioch as being ma g ni ' ficent, its markets flourishing, the industry and resources of its people great, and its manufactures and commerce prosperous. 2 But at present the bazars are poor; the principal products being confined to the sugar-cane, fruits, silk, cotton, leather, 1 The three other gates are Bdb Hadid and Bab Ladiklyeh, both leading southward, and Bib Ginein, or the gate of the gardens. 8 Jaubert's Edrisi, p. 31, tome VI.; Recueil de Voyages et de M&amp;noires.

The census Antiocb in takeii by lhr{ihim in 18 35 } of the intended capital of the restored monarchy of Syria, gave, exclusively of about 6000 Egyptian troops, a population of 5600 souls, a large proportion being Greeks, who are under a patriarch. Though time and misrule have reduced the city in which the disciples of Christ first received their distinctive appellation to the level of an ordinary Turkish town, the natural beauties of the environs remain. About two miles and a half south-west of the city, in a rocky cleft shaded by a prodigious oriental plane- Fountain of tree, is the translucent fountain of Zoiba; and near it some Zoiba. remains of aqueducts, walls, bridges, &amp;c., mark an ancient site, probably that of Antigonus. About three and a half miles farther, in the same direction, situated in an amphitheatre amidst wild scenery of luxuriant beauty, is Beit-el-Moi'e, or the house of water. Here the numerous fountains of ancient Daphne burst at once from a grove of bay-trees on the side of the hill, from whence the water passes in numerous streams through broken ground, forming two shaded cascades, amidst numerous islets, rocks, and petrifactions; a striking and picturesque effect being produced, not unlike the grand view of the second cataracts of the Nile in miniature. After turning several mills, the stream flows onward through bay- trees, myrtles, and oleanders, till it is lost in the wild and rocky scenery of the Orontes; with which are mixed corn fields, mulberry, pomegranate, and myrtle-groves, interspersed with aromatic plants.

Daphne. On the other side of Jebel Musa, beyond Suwe'idiyah, are the ruins of the once magnificent port of Antioch, and those of Seleucia Pieria. The walls of the city and suburbs remain; the latter touched the mole, and were of a triangular shape ; while the former were quadrangular, and had a double line of defence, with the northern side abutting on the hill, whose summit was crowned by the Acropolis. A gate led from the suburbs towards the sea, and on the opposite side of the city, towards Antioch, was another; this was adorned with pilasters, and defended by handsome towers. The space occupied, including the suburbs or market-place, has a cir cumference of about four miles, and is filled with the ruins of houses. The basin is enclosed by a massive wall of cut stone; Ancient Basin, it is an irregular oval, extending upwards of 400 paces north eastward from the suburbs, with a breadth between the city and the sea-wall which increases from nearly 200 paces at the northern to 300 paces at the southern extremity; so that there would be sufficient space for a large fleet. At the former extremity were the flood-gates; and there was, beyond the entrance, a passage of about 200 paces long430 TOMBS OF THE KINGS. [CHAP. XVIII. Ancient Basin, by 50 paces wide. The first part of this opening is cut through solid rock; and on each side are visible the remains of defensive towers, partly excavated, together with the niches in which the flood-gates had been suspended.

One portion of the excavations, called the Tombs of the Kings, has a facade and suites of apartments, with columns and stair-cases leading to a singular set of chambers above. In some of the grottoes are the remains of paintings, with remark- ably bright colours; in general, however, they are ordinary excavations, without architectural ornaments, and many of them appear to have been common troglodyte dwellings.CHAP. XVIII.] TUNNELS AT SELEUCIA. 431 But the most interesting part of the remains at Seleucia Hollow-way, is the line of excavations cut through the rocky mountain from the north-eastern extremity of the town to the edge of the sea, a little northward of the entrance of the port. The first part of this extraordinary work is a hollow way of 600 feet long, by 22 feet wide, and in some places about 120 feet high; and the second is a regular square tunnel, 293 feet in length by 22 feet wide and 24 feet high; which, like the preceding portion, is cut through a compact tertiary limestone. [View of the Tunnel and Hollow way at Seleucia.] To the latter succeeds another hollow way of 204 feet and tunnels at long by 22 feet wide; from the bottom of which, at the southern side, whilst the excavation itself descends more rapidly, a supply of water was carried along a channel of 18 inches wide, preserving nearly the same level till it reached the exterior side of the hill, from whence it was carried southward into the city. In this portion of the work, which is 110 feet high, a narrow stair-case descends along the side of the rock, from the top of the excavation, to within about 14 feet of the bottom ; which probably was the ordinary level432 THE SITE OF ALEPPO.

In a recess near the opposite extremity of this cut are some well-executed tombs in the upper part of the rock, and a little onward the effects of time are apparent, in the water having forced a passage through the southern side of the excavation, from whence it proceeds along a steep rocky descent into the great basin. Thus far the general direction is W. ^ S.; but the excavation now sweeps gradually round, and, at 322 feet northward, it is crossed by an arch bearing some imperfect inscriptions; 1 finally, about 588 feet farther, the hollow way, which in this part is 30 feet high by 17 feet wide, terminates abruptly without any kind of steps, at nearly 30 feet above the level of the sea. site of Aleppo. Aleppo, the modern capital, is situated nearly in the centre of the district, amidst extensive pleasure-grounds, which dis play a singular mixture of esculent plants and flowering shrubs, blended with patches of cotton, tobacco, and various kinds of standard fruit-trees, intermingled with those of the forest, such as the oriental plane, the willow, the ash, the white poplar, and the kharrub or locust-tree. Gardens ian This tract, which has the name of the Syrian gardens, is sheltered by a range of hills of no great elevation, of which Jebel Adam forms the southern and south-eastern portions; and on whose slopes are excellent vineyards and productive groves of the pale-leafed flowering pistachio tree. The Habeb 2 of the natives covers several low stony hills, the highest being that in the centre, which is occupied by the castle; and it is strikingly situated in a kind of amphitheatre, watered by the river Koweik, or rather in a hollow extending east and west, which is divided by a valley crossing it from 1 IMP CESAR ITAEHO HA NO AT 10 RAMI Jaubert's Edrisi, tome VI., p. 136.—Recueil de Voyages et de M^moires Paris, 1840.CHAP. XVIII.] PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 433 north to south. The town is fortified by a substantial wall about 40 feet high, with towers at intervals rising eight or ten feet higher; there are seven gates, and previously to the great earthquake it contained nearly 40,000 houses. Contrary to the practice generally followed in the East in Construction of the construction of buildings which may resist the shocks 0 f tlie houses - earthquakes, these houses are two or three stories high, resting upon substantial arches, and are entirely of stone, with the exception of the roofs. The latter, as usual, consist of flat terraces, frequently containing beds of shrubs and flowers, amongst which visitors pass for considerable distances along the roofs of the houses, having the assistance of ladders where there is a difference of level. The streets are roughly paved, generally with the addition of foot-paths; and are kept tolerably clean by the daily rounds of scavengers with donkeys and panniers. Besides whole streets of arched buildings for merchandise, Bazars, &amp;c. there are several extensive and well supplied bazars which, as usual, are divided in separate portions for the dealers in spices and drugs (the latter strangely enough including confection ery as well as different kinds of goods). Other sections are appropriated to the use of goldsmiths, silversmiths, copper smiths, blacksmiths, tailors, saddlers, shoemakers, &amp;c. The city contains about 60 baths, 200 fountains, 100 mosques, as many coffee-houses, several Oakous or religious institutions, with a proportion of Madresehs (colleges), public schools, and Mekhemeks or courts of justice. There are also five Christian churches, and several fine two-storied Karvanserai's, some of which are partly occupied by silk-spinners, common weavers, and a numerous body of men who manufacture silk stuffs, coarse cottons, &amp;c. The castle stands on the summit of a fine conical Tell, with The castle, an oval base of about 450 yards by 250 yards; it is nearly 200 feet high, and chiefly artificial, having its lower slopes faced with stone. A deep ditch surrounds this work, which is passed a bridge of seven arches, or rather a narrow ascending causeway, defended by a castellated building at the outer, and a second at the inner extremity, where a draw-434 CASTLE OF ALEPPO.

Although much injured by earthquakes, this is still a fine specimen of a work belonging to the time of the crusaders, to which Saracenic defences have since been added. A Cufic inscription over the gate is dated in the sixth century of the Hijrah. The walls and square towers follow the crest of the mound, and present a double line of defence, there being, quite round the castle, a loop-holed gallery beneath the parapet: the longer sides of the structure, or those towards the south and north, have in the centre of each a square tower rising from the bottom of the ditch to the foot of the walls, and flanking the sides of the mound. On the summit there is another tower about 60 feet high, which no doubt was constructed for a look-out place; and certainly it commands a most extensive view, especially towards the Beilan mountains. At a considerable depth, and nearly in the centre of the castle, there is a well with a sloping descent like that at Cairo, which gives a com munication with the two towers defending the ditch, and also with some subterranean apartments. In the latter there were, at the period of my visit to Aleppo in 1832, several balistse, catapultse and other weapons, such as bows and arrows, which appear to have remained there since the evacuation of the place by the croises. There were besides some interesting specimens of ancient ordnance, consisting of guns, each roughly formed of iron bars hooped and welded together, so as to form an imperfect bore. Probably this rude kind of instrument was used by the Turks before they cast heavy artillery. 1 But a still earlier attempt to employ gunpowder in war is understood to have been made by this people in Egypt, where there exists a kind of mortar formed by excavating a rock.

But, although well built and clean, the interior of Aleppo Present state of excites much of the disappointment experienced by the traveller 8 in erior ' on entering almost every oriental city: except in the vaulted stores, or the more busy arcades of the bazars, which, as usual, may be said to constitute the city, the place presents a succession of narrow streets, closed by dead walls, and occasionally pierced with small latticed openings; but since 1822 its riven walls and ruined buildings exhibit every stage of destruction, from an inclining or broken arch to a shapeless mass of stones. In many places the damaged arches are seen still supporting portions of dwelling-houses; and it is said that they were the means of preserving the inmates: it may therefore be presumed that, in some cases at least, this architectural feature possesses advantages over a solid wall, in resisting such convulsions as that which then desolated Antioch. The excavations a little way eastward of the town are the Excavations only vestiges of ancient remains in the neighbourhood. They are very extensive, and consist of suites of large apartments, which are separated by portions of solid rock, with massive pilasters left at intervals to support the mass above. Owing to the regularity of the plan, and the pains bestowed in their execution, these rocks are easily distinguished from the rough quarries from whence stones were taken to build the modern city. According to tradition, ancient Aleppo was also situated on Supped site the river Koweik, 20 miles southward of Antioch; and this town, is the position of Kinnisrin ; it is therefore probable that the ruins there represent the Aram Zobah of the Scripture, 1 after- 1 Psalm Ix. ; and Benjamin of tudela, by A.

No disorders or nightly tumults occur; and instances of murder and robbery are extremely rare. 3 Number of the The deaths which occurred during the catastrophe of 1822, and the abandonment of the place by many persons subse quently, has reduced the number of the inhabitants of Aleppo from upwards of 150,000 to little more than 100,000 souls. The people, independently of passing Arabs, Kurds, and Turkomans, consist of 66,500 Turks, 3000 Armenians, 19,000 Greeks, 4500 Jews, 5000 Maronites, and 2000 Syrians and Aleppines, of whom the parent stock was a mixture of Euro peans and natives, the former being chiefly Greeks. The nomadic people of this pashalik are composed of the Henadi, the Bern Said, and other Arab tribes, 4 with the addition of a few gypsies, here called Kurpadh, also some sections of Kurds and Turkomans. The habits and customs of the sons of Kaktan and Ishmael do not differ from those of their nation; but in this part of the world the social state of the two last-mentioned sections of people has undergone some change.

XVIII.] TRIBES OF THE DISTRICT. 437 continue to be wanderers; but some branches of this people are located on the slopes of the mountains and the crests of the hills, which enclose the valleys of the Sajur, the Kersin, Afrin, &amp;c. In these portions of the country the Kermanj have been allowed to retain the patriarchal government; the Boyah Beg, or chief of the district, being answerable to the authorities appointed by the Sultan for the taxes, labour, and duties to be performed by his people or tribe. The dwellings of these Kurds hold a middle place between Dwellings of tents and permanent habitations, and the number of houses the Kurds ' ^ in a village vary from 15 to 40: they are constructed of mud, or of the rudest kind of rubble masonry; and the people, though extremely ignorant, are of peaceable and hospitable dispositions. The majority of the Turkomans are nomadic; but certain branches of this people, as the Ryhanlu, the Jerid, and the Richwans do not quit the plains of Syria, and they are in some respects more civilized than the others. Their chief retains the ancient title of Malek or king. About forty-five years ago Haider Agha, one of the Extension of Ryhanlu chiefs, induced some of his tribe to become cul- a &amp; riculture - tivators; and the advantages of this mode of living becoming manifest, the practice of agriculture gradually extended. In order to encourage it, Ibrahim Pasha intrusted local pdwer to certain chiefs, as Achmet Beg of Murad Pasha, and Muhammed Beg of Kilis; the former has adopted the modern dress of the Sultan and Pasha, but he continues to live in tents after the manner of his ancestors, and keeps up a sort of feudal state on the plain of 'Umk; and the latter has established himself at Kilis, which he has made the seat of the government committed to his care. The rest of the agricultural population consists of Turks, Syrians of the a portion of the Anzeyrys, who have spread into the pashalik dlstrict from that of Tripoli, and also some Syrians. The last occupy the ravines on the northern slopes of Mount Casius and Anti-Casius, as well as some of those on Mount Rhosus and the Amanus, and live in small secluded villages. Their houses usually have sloping roofs, which are covered with tiles ; and those of the better kind have two small dwelling-438 SYRIANS OF THE DISTRICT. [CHAP. XVIII. Houses of the rooms, attached to which are the stables for the animals. In general, however, the houses consist of a single apartment, one end of which is appropriated to the cattle and the other to the family; a separation being formed by a row of high conical wicker baskets containing grain, flour, &amp;c. The building is either of wood and clay, or of stone; and it is fre quently within or adjoining a mulberry garden. Agriculture and the care of silk-worms, together with the preparation of silk, which last is performed chiefly by women and children, are the occupations of the people. They have some good horses, and numerous bullocks for farming purposes. The dress of the Syrians consists of a coarse muslin turban twisted round the head like that of the Bedawin; also a long white coarse woollen cloak, and common boots or shoes. The women's dress is likewise of home manufacture, and they do not cover the face. The food is particularly simple, consisting principally of eggs, milk, and coarse bread, with a large pro portion of cucumbers, water melons, and other vegetables. They appear to be unacquainted with the tenets of the Koran ; and not having any knowledge of a sabbath, their mysterious rites have been thought to relate to some kind of idolatry; their history also is supposed to be connected with that of - the earliest inhabitants of the country. Be this as it may, it is but right to observe, that during our lengthened intercourse we almost invariably found them well disposed, and of a par ticularly gentle and retiring disposition. Before the arrival of the Egyptian Pasha the existence of this branch of the Syrian people seems to have been scarcely known.

As the communications appear to have been constant, and the warlike inroads from Assyria frequent, the population along the line of the great route towards southern Syria would be exposed to repeated and sweeping changes; butCHAP. XVIII.J CLIMATE NEAR THE COAST. 439 being once peopled by the invaders, the recesses of the moun tains westward of this line might long continue undisturbed. No road traversed this part of the territory ; and whilst Epi- phania, or Hamath the Great, and other places more eastward, communicated with Assyria, Tedmor, Damascus, &amp;c., the deep valleys on the slopes of Mount Casius and the Amanus were, in all probability, excluded from any such intercourse. Therefore, it is not by any means improbable that these Syrians may be the descendants of the most ancient inhabi tants, whose manners have continued almost unchanged, notwithstanding the revolutions produced by the wars of the Arabians, Turks, and Christians; as well as by the influx of the Kurdish,Turkoman, and other tribes. The most genial of the three kinds of climate which are Temperature ^ experienced in the pashalik of Aleppo is that comprised within a the alluvial plain of 'Umk and the adjoining coast from Is- kenderun to the lower Orontes, including the valleys running into the latter, among which are those of the greater and lesser Kara Chai. This beautiful tract, in which the vine, the pome granate, the bay, the oleander, and the myrtle are so luxuriant— may be considered as having a mean elevation above the sea of about 280 feet, and an average temperature of 65 or 66 degrees. Although somewhat stony in certain places, the soil in gene- SoUand pro- ral is a rich loam; and as the spring rains which succeed a short but rather severe winter are immediately followed by a considerable degree of heat, the country is singularly pro ductive in fine silk, cotton, corn, fruits, and tobacco. Thun der-storms, accompanied by heavy showers, occur now and then during the summer months, and this part of the country is likewise occasionally visited by earthquakes.

The inhabitants are healthy and robust, although they are not by any means free from intermittent fevers; cataracts and other diseases of the eyes also prevail; and there are some cases of cancer and dropsy. Temperature The second description of climate is the upland of Aleppo, with the country stretching eastward and westward from thence, including in the latter direction the valleys of the Afrin, the Sajur, &amp;c. This tract has a mean elevation which rather exceeds 1300 feet above the sea, and an average tem perature of about 57 degrees. Immediately round Aleppo the soil is stony, but elsewhere it consists chiefly of rich loam, to which more eastward succeeds an indurated clay, with a beaten surface; but towards the banks of the Euphrates the latter is replaced by beds of chalk. Although the mean annual temperature is so moderate, 1 this tract differs from the preceding by the severity and long duration of the winters, as well as the heat of the summers. Partial cuiti- Being, like the steppes of the old world and the savannas of the new, deprived of large timber and the higher kind of vegetation, the surface of the ground becomes greatly parched in summer ; whilst the elevation of the plateau and its position between the Taurus and Lebanon, together with its exposure to winds cooled by the evaporation of the desert, sufficiently account for the existence of a lower temperature than that - which prevails elsewhere in the same latitude. When left to nature, the plain of Aleppo is covered with compositse and umbelliferse, which, in the spring, are succeeded by an abun dant vegetation ; a large proportion of it only serves, however, for pasture-ground to the nomadic people, the rest of the surface being partially cultivated by the Fellahs and agricul tural Turkomans, who frequently do not care to cultivate the same spot for two successive years. The rains commence some days earlier, and are more fre- 1 This was ascertained by the observations made on the temperature of the springs, by Mr. Ainsworth.CHAP.

The calamity of August, 1822, was preceded by a violent wind, and its subsequent passage from east to west, throughout an extent northward to Kaiseriyeh and southward to Cairo, as marked by its effects at Adankh, Ain-tab, Rum Kal'ah, Bir, Damascus, and other places, was ascertained to be almost instantaneous. 3 The air being pure and dry, intermittent fevers and other The Aleppo diseases are less frequent than in the preceding region; and, as the inhabitants attain a good age, this part of the country may be considered decidedly healthy; although the people in the uplands, especially near the capital, are subject to a pecu liarly unpleasant disease called the Aleppo button, which seldom fails to leave a disagreeable scar on the face. As at Baghdad, the hard boil in question is attributed to the effects of the water; it is, however, more general here than there, and a resident of Aleppo rarely escapes the disease. The third climate comprises the higher tracts which extend climate near from Bir by Am-tab to Kilis; and again from the latter the mountalns • along the foot of the Taurus and slopes of the Amanus.

With the exceptions of the valuable pistachio nut, abun dantly produced round Aleppo, the adis, an excellent pea, which is cultivated about A'zaz, Kills, &amp;c., and the wild po tato, 1 the vegetable productions differ but little from those of the rest of Syria. Wild animals. Amongst the animals, however, may be noticed the lion, the bear, the leopard (Nimer) 2 , the hunting tiger (Faadh) 3 , the lynx (Wushak), the black-eared lynx (Kara Kulak), the striped hysena, the wolf (Tib), the porcupine (Kimfud), 4 the squirrel, the ratel, the sabel, several kinds of jerboa, the pole cat (Eben Aarse), and the mangusta. 5 The stag 6 is met on the slopes of the Taurus, also the wild goat, 7 and more southward the fallow-deer, 8 the roe-buck, 9 two kinds of gazelles, 10 the hare of the mountain and that of plains, the latter of which has long hair and ears.

Different kinds of falcons, some not described, are probably more numerous in this than in almost any other part of the globe. They form part of the regular establishment of the rich Turks, and are generally seen near the tents of the Turkoman chiefs. The latter pride themselves on a thorough knowledge of every thing connected with these fine birds, and with the exciting amusement of the chase, more particularly that of the gazelle. The privileged stork, the pelican, 1 and several kinds of aigrette abound; owls, great and small, are numerous ; likewise the francolin, the solitary snipe, the sanderling, and nearly every other kind of bird belonging to northern Europe, from the cock of the wood and the bustard to the diminutive wren (here migratory), are to be seen at certain periods passing southward and again northward through the pashalik. There are, however, some birds which more particularly belong to the district, such as the green parrot, the locust-eater, also a kind of quail about the size of a small pigeon, the kata of the Arabs, which, at times, literally darkens the air by its num bers ; and the Tair-el-Raouf, or the Magnificent.

XVIII.] COMMERCE OF ALEPPO. 445 Besides the change caused by opening a route to India Former state of round the Cape of Good Hope, there has been, from other ^ commerce - causes, a considerable decrease in the commerce of Aleppo. Formerly there were in the city 40 Venetian and as many as 18 or 20 French mercantile houses, chiefly in connexion with Marseilles, while only two or three were English; and scarcely 80 years ago there were six caravans which pro ceeded annually to Baghdad: the largest consisted of nearly 12,000 camels, and the smaller from 5000 to 6000; so that about 50,000 camels left Aleppo annually, besides those which went to Damascus, Beirut, Kurdistan, and Asia Minor. Whereas, in 1832, the number scarcely exceeded 6000; the French establishments were reduced to one or two agency houses, and there was but one regular British establish ment. Being placed between the river Euphrates on one side, and ^ the Mediterranean Sea on the other, with the advantage of state, easy land communications to countries lying southward, northward, and eastward, Aleppo is admirably suited for commerce, but its inhabitants want the address necessary to excite in their simple neighbours, the Kurds, Turkomans, and Arabs, a taste for the conveniences and luxuries which commerce would supply. The towns of Edlip, Antioch, Mar'ash, Ain-tab, Orfah, Diyar Bekr, and Mardin, though well-situated as depots for articles of merchandise, are destitute of proper European agents j and it may be added that a want of information respecting the topography of the district has hitherto, in a great measure, prevented commercial operations from being extended beyond the walls of the city. In 1836, when the merchants at Aleppo proposed to pay the compli ment.of meeting the steamers then engaged in surveying the river, and Balis was named as the most convenient place, they were found to be ignorant even of its existence ; our visitors were, in consequence, merely two travellers.

But, as the number of our mercantile establishments is in creasing, more extensive dealings are likely to be undertaken;446 IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. [CHAP.

At present, the whole of the transit trade depends upon native dealers who come from the towns above mentioned with very slender means and very limited credit, to make purchases at Aleppo. Want of capital seems at present to be the great bar to an extension of the trade. There are about 70 Muhammedan, and 30 native Christian houses in Aleppo; but the united capital of the former is not supposed to exceed 70,000/., whilst that of the latter is less than 150,000/.: and, as the Eu ropeans are chiefly commission merchants, the shopkeepers within and about Aleppo cannot be accommodated with the long credits which the nature of their dealings requires. The European imports are coffee, sugar, spices, inferior rum from America, rice, cochineal, indigo, dye-woods, amber, lead, tin, earthenware, calicoes, cotton-twist, muslins, cambric, English cloths and stuffs, gold and silver lace, French and German cloth, Genoa silks and velvets, German glass, cutlery, quicksilver, and coral; which, at a moderate cost, are brought on camels from Iskenderun and Ladikiy£h. In addition to these, galls, buffalo skins. Mocha coffee, Cashmir shawls, pearls, and Indian goods, are brought by the caravans from Mesopotamia; and, like the former articles, on the limited scale suited for the present demand. Coarse cottons and rich stuffs of silk, and silk mixed with cotton, gold, and common thread, together with iron, copper, and tin vessels, are manufactured at Aleppo for home use; and a bare sufficiency of wheat, barley, maize, &amp;c., is cul tivated to supply the wants of the inhabitants. The exports are limited to a small quantity of silk, with hare, fox, and other skins, which are chiefly sent to the French and Italian ports; also galls, cotton, goats' wool, sheep's wool, hemp, flax, yellow berries, olive oil, soap, saffron, safflower, sponges, barilla, bees'-wax, madder, and wine. The balance of trade, however, is greatly in favour of Europe, the imports being almost double the value of the ex-CHAP.

Moreover, the want of returns frequently obliges British vessels to proceed from Iskenderun to Smyrna and other places to complete their cargoes. A more moderate scale of duties on the products of Syria would in time remedy the evils by drawing out the resources of the country; for, if agriculture were improved, and the natural riches, such as iron, native steel, goats' hair, silk, olive oil, madder, saffron, &amp;c., were turned to more account; also, if the sheep's wool were more carefully washed and prepared for the British market, there would be ample returns for a flourishing commerce. In 1831, All Pasha, now the chief of Baghdad, and then Navigation of governor of Aleppo, with a view to the commercial prosperity &amp;c.,^ropo r sed S ' of the latter city, was about to clear a part of the ancient port of Seleucia^ and to give at the same time another great outlet for goods by re-opening the navigation of the Euphrates. Ibrahim Pasha also proposed to equalize the bed of the Orontes so as to make it navigable for track-boats to Antioch, and this last is quite practicable, notwithstanding the great strength of the current The windings of the river give a distance of nearly 41 miles from Antioch to the bar, and as the difference of level between these places is 269 feet, there would be a gradual fall of about six feet and a half per mile: a row of piles running into the sea in a line with the western bank of the river, would probably keep the bar sufficiently clear to admit country vessels with facility, and the northern branch of the Orontes might then be ascended to Murad Pasha at least; whilst the southern could be navigated by means of light boats to Jisr Shugher, if not much higher up. None of these improvements have been, however, carried into effect. But with such a harbour as that of Iskenderun, the finest on road the coast of Syria, as far as regards commerce by sea, nothing Fr is wanting but an improved road to facilitate the intercourse. 1 Six or seven years ago, the imports from England to Aleppo amounted to about 160,000/., and the exports were roughly estimated at about 12,000/.448 PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. [CHAP. XVIII. The resources and advantages are, moreover, so great, that a little time and a trifling impetus would probably be sufficient to restore the commerce of Aleppo to what it was 50 or 80 years ago, when goods were sent so largely from thence into Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, and the southern parts of Asia Minor; and even to raise it to a state of far greater pros perity.( 449 ) CHAPTER XIX.

T he Eyalet, formerly the Pashalik of Tarabolus, is situated Extent of between the Pashalik of Aleppo and those of Damascus ara 0 U8 ' and Akka; it is separated from the first by the line striking from Ras-el-Basit towards the Orontes, 1 and it extends southward from thence along the second district till it meets the third in the Kesruan; having the Mediterranean Sea on the west, and the Lebanon and Nosairian ranges for its eastern limits. With the exception of a plain, extending along the coast its features, from Tripoli to Ladikiyeh, this tract consists almost entirely of a chain of mountains, whose eastern side rises abruptly from the level country; whilst, on the western, there are numerous offset branches, consisting of steep ridges and deep valleys, succeeding one another till they terminate in bold hills near the coast. The Orontes forms part of the eastern limits; the other streams, which have comparatively short courses, partake of vol. i. 1 See above, page 410.450 nAhr-el-kebir. [chap. xix. Rivers. the nature of mountain torrents, flowing westward into the Mediterranean. The river next in point of size, the Nahr-el- Kebir, waters the northern extremity of the district, and it is formed by the confluence of several streams near Ai'n-el- Labben, two of which, the Ain-el-Afschan, and the Ain-el- Suka, descend from the Ansarian mountains; whilst the northern and largest, which is formed by two branches, the Moie Ham and the Moie Erdjeg, comes from the eastern extremity of Jebel Kraad. From their junction at A'in-el- Labben the trunk flows along a deep and narrow valley, at the foot of Jebel Sahun, and preserves a south-westerly direction till it carries into the sea, about two miles south ward of Ladlkiyeh, a body of water which is considerable even in summer. Course^ the Between this river and Tortosa the country is intersected 6 ir ' by a number of torrents, to which, a little beyond that place, the Nahr-el-Kebir, a more considerable stream, succeeds. The latter has, in the neighbourhood of Mar Djordjos, several sources, which meet a little to the westward of Djopta, from whence the trunk thus formed, which represents the ancient Eleutherus, 1 flows nearly west by south along the valley separating the Ansarian range from that of the Lebanon, and finally reaches the Mediterranean nearly 10 miles southward of the town just mentioned. During the winter the Nahr- el-Kebir occasionally becomes so much swollen that the Hamath caravans are at times obliged to remain for weeks on its banks before they can cross. 2 River of Tripoli. The river of Tripoli, another considerable stream, is formed by three branches, viz.: the Gubban, the Nahr Bashan, and the Abri All or Kodis Chai', all of which come from the vicinity of Bshirrai, in the valley of Eden; these having united a little to the eastward of Tripoli, the trunk flows through the town and into the sea at the port. The eastern side of the district presents a succession of steep slopes, covered with timber or pasture, and having patches of cultivation around the villages and hamlets of the 1 Plin., lib. V., cap. xx. 2 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 161.CHAP. XIX.] TARTOUS, OR TORTOSA. 451 Kurds and Mitaulis; but the steep ridges separating deep valleys and mountain basins, whicli are occupied by hundreds of villages, constitute the features of the country on the western side. Wherever it is practicable, the industrious inhabitants have raised walls to support terraces, on which are cultivated vines, mulberry, and olive trees ; and interspersed with these, are patches of tobacco, hemp, wheat, dhurrah, &amp;c.; the rest of the surface, being a mixture of the boldest rocks, shaded by pines, cedars, &amp;c., presents the most animated and striking scenery that can well be imagined. Marked natural separations have given rise to eighteen Subdivisions of subdivisions of this district. Immediately northward of ara 0 u8 ' Tripoli itself is that of El Saure, peopled by Maronites; and onward, near the foot of Lebanon, is El Akkar; again, to the north-eastward is El Shara; and still higher, Szafeita, the capital of the Ansaries. A little way to the westward of this place is Mar Djordjos, an extensive Greek convent, with vineyards and olive groves around; 1 and on the coast north ward of El Nahr Kebir is the district of Tartous. Within the town of this name, or rather Antartous, 2 now small and poor, are the remains of a Gothic church and castle. In the time of the Crusades it was a place of great strength, and it is still defensible, 3 being washed by the sea on one side, and elsewhere defended by two lines of well-constructed walls, with a double ditch. Outside of these, towards the south and east, are some fine excavations and other remains of the Remams about ancient city of Orthosia. 4 Two miles westward is the castellated island of Ruad, covered with buildings, and still defended by walls, the highest part of which is at the northern extremity. On the eastern side, opposite the anchorage, are the remains of ancient piers, and on the other is a portion of the sea-wall; it is constructed with large stones, and probably was part of ancient Aradus 5 (Arvad, 6 or 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, pp. 159,160. 2 Edrisi, tome IV., p. 351. 8 An attempt to carry these works was the only failure which occurred during the late operations in Syria. 4 Strabo, Jib.

Its modern representative, Tortosa, has been celebrated in the opening of Tasso's Jerusalem. 2 Markab About 14 miles northwards of Tartous is the small town of Markab, crowning a high conical hill at the distance of nearly a mile from the sea; it is surrounded by strong walls, and, except on one side, where it is inaccessible, there is a double line of defence, supported by a large strong tower on the eastern, and another on the western side, both of them probably erected by the knights of Jerusalem, and Baneas. About 9 miles northward, are the ruins of Baneas ; 3 and nearly at the same distance, farther along the shore, those of Jebili (Gabula) 4 with the remains of a fine Roman theatre, and a great many sepulchral excavations in the rocks by the sea-side. 5 Bay and town The district of Ladikiyeh is understood to commence at of Ladikiyeh. p;[ ace . the plain of Tripoli extends 10 miles farther to the banks of the Northern Nahr-el-Kebir; its rich soil is only partially cultivated, and the produce is chiefly cotton and tobacco; the latter being by far the most esteemed throughout Turkey. A little beyond the river just named, the projecting tongue of Cape Ziaret forms the southern, and a rocky point, about 3 miles farther, the northern horn of the bay of Ladikiyeh; near the extremity of the former is the dilapidated port protected by an old castle, and adjoining these, are the stores and houses of the Marina. Nearly half a mile from thence, on the slope of the hill, is the town of Ladikiyeh, which, in the time of Edrisi, was flourishing and populous; 6 it now contains 5 mosques, 3 Greek churches, one Ar menian Latin convent, a tolerable bazar, and about 1000 1 2 Kings, chap.

The place contains 150 Maronites, as many schismatic Catholics, nearly 2000 Greeks and 3500 Muslims, or about 6000 inhabitants in all, under a Mutesellim, whose govern ment includes the country southward to Jubeil, northward to the foot of Mount Casius, and north-eastward by Candeleh to the Orontes. The sepulchral chambers at the northern extremity of the Remains at bay, the remains of a triumphal arch and Corinthian temple, Ladibyeh ' together with those of an aqueduct and other ruins around, show that Laodicea-ad-Mare was much more extensive than the present town, although, owing to its connexion with Aleppo, it is still one of the most important scales 1 in the Levant. The districts in this part of the country with which we Districts of r . ! 1 r 1 El Fetuh and have of late become better acquainted than we formerly were, j u beii. are more numerous to the south and south-east of Tripoli. Beyond Nahr Ibrahim, in the former direction, is that of El Fetuh, containing the small town and half-ruined port of Meinet Bordja, to which salt and wheat are brought from Cyprus. The district extends eastward along the Kesruan; and to the northward, also along the coast, is that of Jubeil. The latter has a ruined port, and a pretty but small Maronite town of the same name, surrounded by fruit trees and vine yards. 2 Jube'il is enclosed by a wall of about a mile and a Townof Jubeii. half in circumference, with square towers at intervals, apparently of the time of the Crusades; it contains a castle and a bridge, and around are some ruined columns with other remains of the Gebal of the children of Ammon, 3 which supplied caulkers for the fleets of Tyre, 4 and at a later period was called Byblus. 5 Owing to the treachery of Raymond, 1 Scala, or Rada, from the Arabic Kalla (port).-Volney's Travels in Syria, 2 ' Edrisi, p P 356, tome V., Recueil de Voyages et Memoires; Pans, 1840. 8 Joshua, chap.

To the eastward of the first, which is inhabited chiefly by Greeks, is the extensive tract of El Dannye, and higher in the same direction, the great mountain amphitheatre of Bshirrai', which contains a Maronite village of the same name, having 120 houses and 7 churches, sur rounded by gardens of mulberries and other fruits; and on its southern slope is Kanubin, the summer residence of the Maronite Patriarch. This remarkable monastery overhangs a precipitous rock, in the upper part of which, in addition to a church dedicated to the Virgin, and some 40 or 50 cells for the monks, a sepulchral grotto has been excavated for the deceased patriarchs, and another for the priests. On the opposite side is the pretty village of Eden; and higher up in a valley at the eastern side, are the remains of the celebrated forest already mentioned, from whence Solomon was supplied with cedars.

This city, now Tarabolus-el-shaan and the capital of the City of Tripoli. Pashalik, has continued to flourish since the time of Edrisi, 1 and it exemplifies the eastern principle of leaving things as they happen to be found; for it has now, as it had in ancient times, three separate divisions, viz., the Marina, the Town, and the Fortress, which probably represent the sites of the triple town once occupied by the Tyrians, the Sidonians, and the Aradians : 2 at a later period it was the most important city of Phoenicia. 3 The first contains the stores and the dwellings of ship- Bay and an- wrights, labourers, and others connected with trade. The chorage - buildings in this portion are mean, but prettily situated round a bay and an anchorage, which is but imperfectly sheltered by a string of rocky islets, defended by seven square Saracenic towers at equal distances around. About a mile and a half to the eastward, at the base of a triangular plain, is the second and principal portion of the town; this part, which is perhaps the best built in Syria, stretches north and south along the western slope of a hill enclosing one side of Wadi Kadisha, and is picturesquely situated amidst luxuriant groves of orange, lemon, and mulberry trees, interspersed with the dark green of the spiral cypress. Tripoli contains good shops, an excellent bazar, several Population, large mosques, baths, khans, and about 2000 houses, many of which have gothic arcades below, and are covered either with small cupolas, or the ordinary terraced roof, commanding generally a view of the sea. Being intersected by the stream, or rather canal of Nahr Abu AM, water is easily conveyed by means of conduits in every direction; so that few houses are without the luxury of a fountain in the court, and not unfre- quently also jets d'eau in the reception rooms. There is an extensive soap manufactory, and a population of about 3000 Greek catholics, 1000 Maronites, and nearly 14,000 Turks. 1 P. 356, tome V., Recueil de Voyages et M&amp;noires, &amp;c.

The town is enclosed with an ordinary loop-holed wall, and is surrounded by the fruit groves already noticed, which extend up the side of the hill to the eastward. On the latter is the remaining portion of the city, now the fortress, and once the Acropolis, which occupies the whole of the summit, and completely commands the town by the fire of 19 guns. Castle of The work consists of a very high scarp, flanked by square Tripo11 ' towers, and is without a ditch, being as usual constructed, probably by the Saracens, along the extreme edge of the hill. A little to the eastward there is another hill rather more elevated, which is separated from that of the castle by a deep ravine. A little way up Wadi Kadisha there is a convent of Dervishes, and half an hour's journey farther, the valley is crossed by the aqueduct of Koutaret-el-Brins, from which a canal conveys drinking water into the town along the left side of the Kadisha. Ancient Tripolis was one of the last strong-holds held by the Crusaders, from whom it was taken by the Mamelukes in 1289 and it is farther remarkable in consequence of being the first place where the existence of the sugar-cane, then called zucre, or sweet-honied reed, is noticed. 2 Productions Being rather low, and embosomed in gardens, the heat of and inhabitants m • 1 • • • , • • •,. . r . , ■ . of the plain. Tripoli gives rise to intermittent levers at certain seasons, to which, however, owing to the sea-breezes, the Marina is much less exposed than the other parts of the town. Where cultivated, the rich soil of the plain of Tripoli produces the sugar-cane, cotton, silk, grain, and the finest tobacco; higher, it is pebbly and less favourable for cultivation, yet the steep sides of the mountains produce silk, oil, grain, and wine. The Pashalik contains Arabs, Kurds, Mitaulis, and indeed a portion of all the different branches of people belonging to Syria. The western side of the Pashalik represents the northern part of Phoenicia, to which her daring mariners added Cyprus.

The principal or south-western part of the island has the form of an irregular parallelogram, which, with a width of about 40 miles, extends from south-west to north-east, a distance of 90 geographical miles, 1 and then terminates with a long narrow peninsula, running in the same direction an additional distance of 35 miles, to the elides or keys of Cyprus, a string of islets close to the promontory of the same name, 8 the Dinaretum of Pliny. 3 The surface of the country is almost entirely occupied by the elevated range known as the third Olympus of heathen mythology, whose culminating points are Santa Croce (Olympus) and Thrados, which have an elevation of 7000 feet; and the slopes of these mountains descend both to the northern and southern shores. On the former side the chain is bold and rugged; and, in addition to numerous Greek villages on its sides, one of its elevated valleys contains the modern capital, Nikosia. On the southern side the scenery is still bolder, presenting itg metals and a deeply-serrated outline with thickly-wooded sides, which are mmera s ' broken by masses of limestone, or furrowed by deep picturesque valleys, in which grow the narcissus, the anemone, and the ranunculus. These valleys, as well as the slopes, are dotted with villages, hamlets, vineyards, and patches of cultivation, among which appear the towers built to protect the crops. The mountains contain gold, silver, copper, emeralds, and the Paphian diamond, in addition to quarries of asbestos, talc, and red jasper. The level tracts are chiefly confined to the country around the capital, and the plains of Limosa, Larnika, and Famagosta, where marshes have been formed by streams whose beds are occasionally dry. The fruitful and well-irrigated tract at the western extremity forms the modern district of Baffa, one of the seven San- jakliks into which the island is divided by the Turks.

About 60 stadia to the north-west is the later Paphos, 3 a city which we are told was constructed by Agapenor on his return from Troy, and is now represented by the existing town, Baffa. This town contains the Venetian Church of St. George, with a castle commanding the port, and the remains of another higher up. In the time of the Romans it was the seat of government for the district, and it was the chief town in the western division of the island when St. Paul converted Sergius Paulus, the deputy of the Proconsul ; 4 it then con tained the fine temple dedicated to Venus by king Aerias. 5 South-eastward is the Sanjak of Episcopia, probably Cu- Limasoi. rium ; 6 and farther south that of El Nimasoun or Limasol, a prettily-situated town, which contains a good market and numerous buildings,; 7 and a little way onward is Old Limasol, and the site of the Phoenician Amathus, 8 at which place there was a temple dedicated to Venus. 9 Kata ebia and t ^ le nort ^ iern s ^ e t ^ le island are the Sanjaks of Kernebia and Kata, two agreeable towns, having bazars well furnished with provisions and stores of merchandise, &amp;c. ,; 10 also that of Jerma, a small place defended by a fort, and having in the neighbourhood extensive catacombs, which are supposed to mark the site of ancient Ceraunia.

It contains a fine khan, several mosques, one of which was formerly the fine gothic church of St. Sophia; also the serai of the Mutesellim, once the palace of the kings of Cyprus; and about 12,000 inhabitants, chiefly Greeks, who are under an archbishop, the metropolitan of the island. The remaining sanjaks are those of the two principal ports, Famagosta. which are situated, the one on the south-eastern and the other on the southern coast. Famagosta, the more northern port, occupies a part of the extensive plain of Messarea, and is situated a little southward of the river Pedia, on the coast opposite to Ladikiyeh, with which, and one or two other places on the coast of Syria, it has some trade. The modern town, like almost every other place in the island, is much reduced, and only occupies part of the space enclosed by the Venetian walls. The latter are remarkable in consequence of having so successfully resisted the Turks, till this people terminated the protracted and bloody siege of the town, in 1570, by the application of gunpowder, then probably for the first time used in regular mining operations. In the adjoining plain of Tamasea 1 stood Tamaseus, so Constantia. famous in ancient times for its copper mines; 2 and a little way northward, the second Salamis, so long the seat of a remark able kingdom ; 3 its site is now occupied by Constantia, whose extensive vineyards are deservedly celebrated for the most luscious wine.

It is situated in the plain adjoining the salt marshes along the river Tesio, and nearly a mile and a half from the store-houses at the port called Salines. The population is under 6000 souls; and the inhabitants, like those of Famagosta and other towns in the plains, are exposed to intermittent fevers, and also oc casionally to the plague. The villages on the slopes of the mountains, as well as the rest of the country, are very healthy ; and the Cypriots in general are a fine race of people. The island, which in the time of Edrisi contained numerous villages, cultivated fields, woods, meadows and mines, 1 is now almost waste; in certain places, however, the sugar-cane succeeds admirably. The other products are fine silk, cotton, hemp, tobacco, corn, wine, oil, opium, fine honey, turpentine, madder, pomegranates, oranges, lemons, and other fruits; the exports of wh,ich might be increased so as to realize the abundance existing in the time of Strabo. 2 The ancients gave various names to the island, such as Cerastis, 3 alluding to its numerous promontories; Cypros 4 or Cyprus, from an indigenous shrub; it was also called Aerosa, from its copper mines. There have been preserved some his torical traces of the island, which are particularly interesting. It appears, according to Eratosthenes, 5 that the Phoenicians first visited Cyprus 17 centuries before our era, and not long subsequently it was occupied by the Ethiopians and other people, 6 amongst whom probably were the sons of Cethimus and the descendants of Japhet, who, according to Josephus, 7 were its earliest possessors, and who called the island Cethima. 8 The Salaminians, led by Teucer, son of Telamon, founded Salamis in the island about 1160 B.C. 9 This city became the Jaubert's translation of Edrisi, p. 130, tome VI., Recueil de Voyages, &amp;c. 8 Lib.

Alexander, Cyprus fell to Antigonus, who was subsequently deprived of it by Ptolemy, and it continued to belong to Egypt till it was seized by the Romans. It afterwards formed part of the Eastern Empire, to which it remained subject till it was taken, in the year 650, by the Saracens, under Moa- wiyah Ebn Abu Sosian. Subsequently it reverted to the Greek Emperors, and was governed as a separate principality by one of the Comneni till 1191. In that year, on a supposed affront, Richard Cceur de Lion seized the island, which he first sold to the Templars, and afterwards transferred, with little ceremony, to the Lusignans, by whom it was retained nearly three centuries. In consequence of a marriage, it sub sequently came to the Venetians, with whom it remained till 1570, since which period it has belonged to the Turks. The Pashalik of Sai'de, or Akka Proper, is situated between Limits of Saide, the preceding Pashalik and those of Damascus and Gaza; 01 having within its limits at the northern extremity the Kesruan, which formerly belonged to Tripoli. A line running from the bay of Jumi north-eastward along the latter as far as the eastern slope of the Lebanon, and a little north of Baalbek, separates the district from that of TaraboMs, from which latter it extends southward to Kaisariyeh: its southern limit extends eastward from the Mediterranean to the Anti-Lebanon, and to the great depression of Lake Tiberias. The tract adjoining the latter portion of the district has already been described and the remainder, which extends westward to the shores of the Mediterranean, is divided by the river Kasmieh (Leontes) into two nearly equal portions, which, however, present a marked contrast to each other; the territory to the northward of the river just mentioned, representing the greater part of Upper Galilee, is furrowed with gorges, ravines and cultivated valleys, whilst the territory on the southward side, or the 1 Lactantius, lib. I., c. xxi. ' See above, page 401.462 PLAINS OF GALILEE. [CHAP. XIX. remainder of Upper and the whole of Lower Galilee, encloses Plains ofSafet several fine plains. One of these, that of Safet, stretches north eastward of that place along Lake Houle, towards the border of Upper Galilee. Another, called El Buttauf, extends from Kana-el-Jelil as far in the direction of Lake Tiberias as El Hattin, where was fought the battle between the Crusaders, under Guy de Lusignan, king of Jerusalem, and the Saracens, under Salah-ed-din, who gained a complete victory. 1 A little way from Kana-el-Jelil commences the Ard-el-Hammar, which extends in a S.S.E. direction for some distance along the mountains at the western side of the Lake ; and farther on, at the southern border of Lower Galilee, is the plain of and Esdraeion. Merj Ibn Amir, formerly Esdraelon, which has been alike remarkable for its fertility and as the site of historical events. Here occurred the discomfiture of Sisera, and the defeat of Ahab ; and here Napoleon gave effectual support to Kleber, by defeating the Turks between the village of Fuleh and Mount Tabor. South-westward of the hilly ground about Nazareth, the plain has a width of 12 miles, and in some places 15 miles ; and with the exceptions of a few undulations, principally some hills about Jezreel and little Hermon, 2 it is quite level, and extends south-eastward for nearly 20 miles along the upper branch of the Nahr Makutta. A valley proceeds from thence along the lower part of that river to the bay of Akka; and there are three others of more considerable extent diverging from its opposite extremity. The most northern of these, Wadi-el-Biri, runs from the foot of Tabor Jezreel of j nto the valle y of the Jordan; the next, that of Jezreel, which is wider and more level, extends in the same direction, from the villages of Solam 3 and Zer'in, near which is the fountain of Jalaad or Jezreel, 4 to Beisan, 5 having the hills of Hermon on the northern, and those of Jelbon, anciently Gilboa, on the 1 Commonly called the Battle of Tiberias.—Mill's Hist, of the Crusades, vol.

On a conical hill, 8 miles north-west, are the village and ruined castle of Sufurieh, anciently Sepphoris, 2 or Dio Caesarea, and the Hebrew Tsippori, 3 with other remains, pre sumed to be those of the Palace of Herod ; and n little onward is the choicest tract in the land of Zabulon. This remarkable plain has an extent of barely five miles, by less than two miles in width, with several pleasing hamlets here and there on the sides of the wooded hills by which it is enclosed.

Features of the The well-known conical Mount Tabor, the Jebel Tur of the country. Arabs, is the highest in this part of Galilee, and its rounded slopes are richly clothed with the valonia oak, besides fine myrtles, the wild pistachio, and other shrubs, which partly cover the ruins on the summit. The elevation of this mount above the base at the village of Dabura (Debora) probably exceeds a thousand feet, and the view from thence is both extensive and pleasing. To the north is the mount of Beati tudes, with the snowy peak of Jebel-es-Sheikh, the greater Hermon and the highest of the Lebanon range towering above in the distance. Eastward are the low mountains extending from Tabariyeh along the western side of the Jordan, with the blue ranges of the Haouran beyond. On the other side of the plain of Esdraelon, towards the south and south-west, is little Hermon, with the range of Gilboa rising to 1000 feet; beyond these are the wooded mountains of Ebal and Gerizim, with the lower parts of Carmel more westward ; and finally, in the latter direction the sea is seen through the range which bounds the plain of Akka. Productions of The latter is partly of sand and partly cultivated, and ex- 'Akka lain of tends from the bay of Kai'pha northward, between the moun tains and the sea, as far as the Tyrian ladder. 2 Beyond this precipitous tongue of land it is renewed, and is almost con tinuous from thence, by Tyre and Sidon, to the limits of the district near Beirut. Its width seldom exceeds three miles, and it is thinly peopled, though the cultivated spots yield ample returns of tobacco, cotton, hemp, grain, and fruits ; the rest of the district is mountainous. Northward of the river Kasmieh, the offsets of Jebel-el- Drus cover the districts of El Schomar and El Teffahh, which present a succession of ridges one above another till they ter minate with the rugged peaks of Jebel-el-Drus itself. The flanks of these offsets, for the most part, display scattered 1 Biblical Researches in Palestine, by Dr. Robinson, vol.

Advancing northward into Schaff, in the territory of the Features of the Druses, the mountains assume that bolder character which sXff y about has been sketched in describing this part of the Lebanon mountains. 1 In some places huge masses rise abruptly from the edge of the sea, whilst in others they gradually recede from it, showing peak above peak, and forming in certain places rocky basins or amphitheatres, on whose sides are vil lages and cultivated terraces shaded by lofty pines or cedars, with, not unfrequently, a convent or monastery above, over looking the whole. Towards the interior, the slopes of Jebel Riehan, and the Features about neighbouring part of the Lebanon, are generally formed by a Jebel Rielian ' succession of hogs'-back ridges, separated by deep gorges or ravines, with walnut-trees on the lower slopes; and about midway are villages and hamlets surrounded with terraces, on which are grown cotton and hemp, besides grapes, olives, mul berries, and other fruits: higher up are forests of pine; and on the summit a profusion of myrtle, with usually a village, adjoining which is either a convent or an Emir's serai. But occasionally the scenery is of a higher cast—a deep and wide gorge terminating in an amphitheatre of valleys and ridges, studded with villages. From the ruined Ionic temple at Deir-el-Kul'ah, for instance, the view presents a great amphi theatre covered with terraces, amidst which 45 Druse villages may be counted in addition to Mar Kana, and several other convents, with the serais of Ras-el-Mittan; beyond these is Jebel Riehan, with the snow-clad peaks and furrowed sides of Jebel Sanin. No sooner has one narrow, ridge in this singular country been gained than another valley or amphitheatre appears teeming, like the preceding, with villages, to reach some of vol. x.

XIX. which, although at short direct distances, a whole day is fre quently consumed in ascending and descending from one village to another by zig-zag paths or steps. The bold ridges separating these mountain basins divide the country, like that of the Maronites, into many small districts, of which Deir-el- Kammar is the principal. Extent of the Immediately northward of these little mountain republics is Kesman. ^ s i n g U i ar tract of the Kesruan, which, as has been already mentioned, forms the northern part of the Pashalik; it ex-; tends for a distance of 20 miles along both sides of the Nahr-el-Kelb, with a breadth varying from three to six miles. Numerous offsets from the main ridge run into this valley, on the wooded sides of which are the cultivated terraces and villages of the Maronites; and on their summits are substan tially-built and extensive convents, commanding views of some of the deepest valleys and the wildest mountain scenery that can well be imagined. The principal Chief, the Emir Ab- dallah, who resides at Razir, has 33 villages and 11 convents belonging to liis jurisdiction; and the other, the Emir Haida of Soleima, has 50 villages and several convents. But at one period the Kesruan was much more extensive than it is now, and had its northern limits on the Nahr Kebir, or Eleutherus. In such tracts as the preceding the valleys and rivers must be numerous; but, except in the rainy season, the latter are small, and inferior to those of mountainous countries in ge- Courseofthe neral. One of the most considerable is the Nahr-el-Kelb a 16 ' e ' (dog river), which waters the preceding tract; it is formed by the junction of the Nahr Salib, the Nahr Leban, and Nahr Backeita, after descending through the deep valleys furrowed in the side of Jebel Sanin. The trunk, which represents the ancient Lycus, then flows westward with a tortuous course through the rest of this wild, wooded country, till it reaches the sea near the southern extremity of the bay of Juml. T wo miles eastward of Beirut is the estuary of the Nahr of that name, which flows thither by a western course, after being formed by two considerable streams, the Nahr-el-Sazib and the Nahr-el-Leban, which come from the higher part of LebanonCHAP. XIX.] RIVERS OF 'AKKA. 467 through the deep and interesting valleys of Sheibani, Soleima, Deir-el-Rughan, and Ras-el-Mitan. Ten miles southward of the town is the Nahr-el-Kadi, or Dermer, probably the Ta -Nahr-ei-Kadi. myrus, which has but a short course from the neighbour hood of Deir-el-Kammar. Again, farther south, and a little way north of Sidon, is the Nahr-el-Owely, or Baruk, the ancient Bostrenus, which reaches the sea after a W.S.W. course from the slopes of Jebel Baruk towards the summit of Lebanon. Southward, the country has fewer large rivers. Besides the small streams already mentioned, there are others terminating at the coast, near Tyre and Sidon; and the Numan, or BeiusandKe- Belus, which flows from Safet westward, through the valleys risun r,vers ' of Hanein and El Karum, and enters the sea a little way southward of Akka. There is lastly the Kerisun, which has two branches, the southern and principal stream flowing from the southern slopes of Gilboa, and thence north-westward through the plain of Esdraelon, in which it receives the Kischar (Kisar) coming from the vicinity of Endor. The trunk thus formed, called El Nahr Makutta,is of inconsiderable size, and flows north-westward along a pleasing valley at the foot of Mount Carmel, till it enters the bay of Kaifa, receiving, on the northern side, a little way short of the latter, a small affluent called the Nahr-el-Kelek, or Katedieh. On the opposite side, about Lake Tiberias, are the plains already noticed, and some valleys ; but in the northern part of the depression the character of the country is materially changed; here Jebel-el-Drus rises abruptly from the plain : jebei-ei-Drus. but instead of having offsets enclosing deep valleys, as on the western side, it presents rounded shoulders thinly covered with oaks, pines, and other trees, with villages and cultivation at distant intervals. Such is also the character of the eastern side of the Lebanon range, opposite to the district of El hchaff, and again on the grassy slopes of Jebel Sanin, where the vil lages are still less frequent. On this side, the nomadic people, such as Kurds, Turko mans, and Arabs, bear a much larger proportion to the fixed population than on the western side of the district, which con- r r 3 o 2468 beirut.

Ancient road. The modern towns and ancient remains, particularly in the northern part of the Pashalik, are of considerable interest. In the limestone promontory overhanging the sea, on the southern side of the Nahr-el-Kelb, a narrow road appears, from an inscrip tion, to have been cut by the Emperor Antoninus Pius to afford an easier passage than that of the higher and more ancient road. Along the remains of the latter have been cut several antique figures, attired in the ancient Persian costume and wig; and as many tablets with the remains of cuneiform inscriptions. Town of BeMt. Six miles to the S.W. is Beirut, the port of Damascus, and, commercially, the most important place in Syria. The town is situated on a kind of shoulder, sloping towards the shore from the north-north-western side of a triangular point, which runs more than two miles into the sea. The town contains upwards of 3000 houses, all of stone, well built, and generally lofty; and some of the best display the consular flags of different nations. The Bazar is ade quately supplied for the wants of the Maronites, Muslim, and other inhabitants, who number nearly 15,000 souls. The streets are narrow, only moderately clean, and usually have in the centre a deep channel of flowing water. The place is enclosed on the land side by a substantial wall flanked by large square towers ; besides which, three were constructed as an additional means of defence in advance of the works, by the Emir Fakr-ed-din. On some rocks at the north-western ex tremity of the town are two castellated buildings to defend the harbour, or, more properly, the anchorage, which is exposed to the west and north-west winds. The innermost castle is con nected with the town by means of a causeway, resting upon arches of unequal size, partly constructed with ancient columns; and through which the sea passes. Beyond the southern extremity of the town there is a basin capable of con taining four or five small vessels; and in its neighbourhood are some cisterns excavated in the rock ; there are also some portions of mosaic pavements and other remains of the city.GHAP.

In the sixth century Beirut was considered to be the finest state of com- city of Phoenicia, but many changes for the worse occurred merte ' subsequently, particularly in the time of the Crusades. A great improvement has, however, taken place of late by the re opening of the European trade with Syria through this port ; and British commercial enterprise is likely now to be propitious to the town. Seventeen miles southward, Saida, or Sa'ide, the modern re- Town of Saide. presentative of the Phoenician capital, is situated on the north western slope of a promontory which runs south-westward into the sea; and the ruins of a fine castle, constructed by Louis the IXth of France, occupy high ground at the southern side of the town. The latter contains about 1800 houses, and nearly 7000 souls ; and being in two portions surrounded by gardens, backed by vineyards and mountains, the appearance is striking. The upper part occupies an acclivity, but owing to the streets being narrow and shaded with matting, it is rather sombre. The lower part, however, 4 is agreeably situated along the shore, where there is a fine two-storied khan, which was at one time a factory belonging to French merchants, and in a flourishing state. Nearly opposite to this building are some rocks and the remains of the port of Sidon the Great, which continued celebrated from the time of Solomon ; 5 till, with the view of excluding the Turks, it was partly filled by Fakr-ed- din ; so that vessels must now anchor near a ridge of rocks at 1 Plin., lib.

Convent of In the mountains eastward of Sidon is the convent of Mar Elias, and a little northward the villa of Jun, which were alternately the residences of Lady Hester Stanhope. Again, and town of about 12 miles north-eastward of Jun is Deir-el-Kammar, the Deu-d-Ram- ca p- ta j 0 £ ^ D ruseSj a ver y singular town of 8000 or 9000 souls, situated on the eastern side of one of the principal valleys in this part of the mountains. The town contains about 8000 Druse and Maronite inhabitants, two Maronite and as many Melchite churches, with nearly 1900 substantially- built dwellings, which form a succession of terraces and a number of narrow streets. In the upper part of the town there is a well-supplied bazar, displaying the rich abbas or cloak, in terwoven with gold or silver threads, for the manufacture of which it is celebrated. On still higher ground, forming a separate hill, or rather shoulder, stands the great pile of building, once the serai of the Emir Bechir. Terraces sown with corn, or on which are planted fruit-trees, particularly the mulberry, extend for some little distance, chiefly to the eastward of the town; and in different spots around the latter there are many sepulchres of an unusual kind. They are stone buildings, 1 II., XXIII., 741; Od., XV., 118. 2 Isaiah, chap. XXII., v. 12. 3 Jos., Ant., Lib. I., c. i., s. 2. * Amounting to 300 vessels.—Herod., lib. VII., cap. Ixxxix.

A castellated entrance leads into an outer court of the latter, round which are arcades, partly used as stables, and partly by the guards and other attendants; on the western side there is a Saracenic archway leading into a second court; and beyond is a third court, which is that of the harem. The second court is in the eastern style, having in the centre a large marble fountain, prettily shaded with orange-trees; and around it are the church and principal apartments, forming several suites. Some of the rooms have Arabesque ceilings and recessed walls, much ornamented with fret-work. These rooms are, however, far inferior to any thing associated with our ideas of a palace ; but the deficiency in this respect is more than compensated by the wild and striking scenery presented from the terraces of the building. Beneath is a deep and winding valley, which at first presents, on one side, terraced gardens, trees, and shrubs, with bold rocks beyond; and on the opposite side is the town, backed by high and rugged mountains, through an opening of which the sea is visible in the distance. 2 About eight hours' journey eastward, on the road to the Bika, is the monastery of Mar Elias, surrounded by vineyards and thriving mulberry plantations ; and, at the commencement of the valley itself, is situated Zahle, one of the principal towns Town of z a hie. subject to the Druses; it contains nearly 9000 inhabitants, and 1500 mud-built, terrace-roofed houses, containing one room, or at most two rooms in each. With the exception of a few Turkish and some Druse families, the inhabitants are 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 193. 4 See Plate XXIII.472 heusn nieha. [chap. xix. Greek Catholics, under a bishop. There are five churches, in addition to a monastery, in the town, where some cloaks, with coarse cottons, are manufactured and dyed by the people. As in the time of Volney, Zahle derives importance from being the intersecting point of the routes between Ba'albek, Damas cus, Beirut, and Mar Elias. It is situated in a kind of recess at the edge of the plain on the lowest slopes of Lebanon, and may be distinguished at some distance by Lombardy poplars of large growth rising above the other trees and houses. A little way eastward, near the village of Keeah, which contains 150 houses, there is a sepulchral building containing a tomb, said to be that of Noah ; the tomb is 10 feet long by 3 feet wide, and is a favourite object of Muslim pilgrimage.

At the western side a flight of steps, supported by two columns, leads to the pronaos and cella of the principal « temple, in which are the remains of columns and Ionic pilasters. Beyond these are some stone steps, then a platform, and another staircase going to the top of the structure, the necessary space for which appears to have been cut out of the mass of rock. Sepulchral In this neighbourhood, not far from the village of Fursul, Fursui! 10 ' 8 at and at the commencement of the plain called Habis, there are a great many sepulchral excavations in the face of the rock, which presents an oblong flat surface upwards of 100 feet high. Some of these chambers are extensive, and contain many re cesses, but the architecture is of an inferior description; several of them are so high above the plain as to be quite inaccessible. A little distance from thence are the remains of a temple called Kerah, which has been similar to the temple at Heusn Ni&amp;ha. Two or three hours northward of these ruins, on the other side of Jebel Sanln, are the dilapidated remains of a rude temple, probably belonging to a very remote period; near which, at a spot called Fakkra or Mezza, in a wild and rocky glen, are two stone pyramids.

Even with the ground there is an entrance on the north side, and there is another at a higher level on the east side. The passage leading from the former is an inclined plane ascending to the interior of the pyramid, and after making several bends nearly at right angles, it unites with the passage from the other entrance. From the place of junction a single gallery proceeds, with a gradual ascent, in directions nearly parallel to the sides of the structure; and when almost at the top, a branch gallery on the southern face turns off at a right angle and leads to the chamber already mentioned. These remarkable pyramids occupy a secluded nook high on the slope of Jebel Sanin, and nearly midway in a direct line between Beirut and Baalbek; the spot is approached with some difficulty, the passage winding through broken masses of limestone, which in some places contain troglodyte dwellings: VOL.

[chap. xix. the masses terminate with rocky pinnacles of a thousand shapes, and, except that their colour is gray, the effect produced by them is not unlike that of the celebrated mer de glace in Switzerland. Town among To the north-eastward of these pyramids a Mitaulis town of Ba'albek. at about 100 wretched houses has been built in the fertile Bika, amongst some of the most finished specimens of ancient archi tecture which the world can produce. The splendid remains at Ba'albek are, however, too well known to require more than a brief notice of some of the most striking portions. At a little distance the principal remains appear to tower like the ridge of a hill above the elevated platform on which they stand (see Plate LIV.) The latter is about 1100 feet from east to west, with a width of nearly 700 feet from north to south, and on it are several buildings, chiefly extending in the former direction. At the eastern extremity, a handsome flight The propy- of steps leads to a Corinthian propylseum of about 260 feet in length, including the exhedrse, which are decorated with Co rinthian pilasters at the extremities, and which have been con verted into defensive towers. Beyond this portico there is and courts. a hexagonal court of 144 feet diameter, independently of the surrounding chambers, which are, however, in a ruinous state. At the western side of this enclosure there is a gateway and a sloping ascent into a grand quadrangular court, occupying the central and highest part of the platform; it is 347 feet from north to south, and 317 feet from east to west, indepen dently of the surrounding apartments: some of these were elegant semicircular alcoves of 30 feet in diameter; others are of larger dimensions, and either square or quadrangular, with light arched roofs. In the interior are several niches, probably once containing small statues, or figures in relief, and on the exterior there appears to have been a kind of colonnade opening into the court, in the centre of which there is an elevated platform of considerable extent, and on it some remains of a structure, possibly one of the altars of Ba'al. Beneath are two vaulted parallel passages extending from the eastern to the western extremity, whose entrances are in the hexagonal court below; and they are connected with eachCHAP. XIX.] THE PRINCIPAL TEMPLES. 475 other by a third passage from north to south. The smaller Vaulted pas has suffered much from time, but the larger is a complete sages ' tunnel of 17 feet wide by 30 feet high. The walls and the semicircular arch resting upon them are of admirable work manship, both being formed of large blocks of closely fitting stones. There are recesses or apartments on each side ; and galleries on the same level appear to have continued this sub terranean communication towards the temples and to the western side of the plateau. The latter extends 283 feet westward of the court first The great noticed, with a breadth of 118 feet, and it had on it a temple temple ' of elegant proportions. There are standing six Corinthian columns, probably part of a splendid peristyle which ap parently had 10 columns in front, and 19 on the sides. Those which still remain are of exquisite proportions and colossal dimensions, being 7 feet in diameter, and, with their pedestals, 71 feet high; in adition to which, there was an en tablature of 11 feet 9 inches, composed of two layers of cut stone, which, together with a fine cornice, give a height of nearly 80 feet. The shafts of these columns are formed of three pieces beautifully fitted without cement, and strengthened with iron cramps fixed into a socket in each stone. A little way southward there is a smaller but more perfect ^youthem temple. This structure is a parallelogram of 225 feet by 118 p feet, having a peristyle of Corinthian columns, 45 feet high, 19 feet in circumference, 9 feet apart, and at an equal distance from the wall. The columns were surmounted by a bold cornice, 7 feet high, from which a fine stone ceiling, with sculpture, representing a Ganymede and other figures, was carried to the wall. Originally, each of the two longer sides of the peristyle had 14 columns, and the shorter 8; but some have fallen into the area below, whilst others have slipped from their pedestals, and lean unbroken against the walls of the temple. The entrance to the interior of the latter is at the east end, through an exquisitely carved door-way, 26 feet hiffh by 20 feet wide; having a staircase on each side leading to the top of the building. The interior space, 118 feet long by 65 feet wide, had niches on each side, and two screens, at J 3 P 2476 ANCIENT IMPORTANCE OF BA'ALBEK. [CHAP.

Substruction of But the pleasure derived from visiting these magnificent the temples. S p ec j mens 0 f Roman art is lost in astonishment when the substruction itself of the monuments is attentively examined. This probably belongs to a remote period, compared with that of the upper part. It is formed with massive hewn stones, of ponderous weight; three of which, near the angle, are more particularly remarkable for their prodigious size ; the largest being 67 feet long, 14 feet broad, and 9 feet thick ; and, in the great quarry, about three-quarters of a mile from the town, a still more gigantic stone remains, almost separated from the rock, preparatory to being transported to the building. Names of the It is unknown by whom, or at what time, the city was founded. Its Greek name, Heliopolis, has the same significa tion as the Syriac word Ba'albek (the city of the sun, or of Ba'al), by which it is now, as in very ancient times, designated. It is, doubtless, the Ba'alath 1 of Solomon; and it may be on the site of the palace built for the daughter of Pharaoh. 2 Its position between Tyre and Palmyra must have rendered it, anciently, a most important commercial station; and to serve as such it was, no doubt, originally founded; but when the trade of the country was diverted into other channels, the prosperity of the city declined: being at length abandoned, even the knowledge of its existence was for a long time lost; and, as was the case with Tadmor, it has only of late been rescued from oblivion. The remaining or southern portion of the Pashalik of Akka includes a part of the coast of Phoenicia, together with the whole of the provinces of Upper and Lower Galilee: in 1 1 Kings, chap.

Although very moun- of ' Akka ' tainous, the ridges surrounding the plains are lower and more rounded than those to the northward ; and the villages of Galilee, instead of being constructed with difficulty on steep acclivities, are for the most part placed either' on swelling hills or on the rounded shoulders of low mountains, where cultivation is carried on without the additional labour of con structing terraces. The villages are small, some distance apart; and the country being thinly peopled, it is only now and then that the traveller perceives one : each of them consists of a cluster of square dwellings, like as many huge blocks of stone placed on the side of a hill, and each is sur rounded by fields, some of which are enclosed with fences of thorn, or the prickly pear. At the eastern boundary of the district is the strong castle of Esh Shukif; and southward of this are the plain and lake of Gennesareth : the former containing the site of Ca- site of Ca^r- pernaum, which is near Am-el-Tin, on the border of the 'o^o^Taba- latter. 2 A little way beyond this place, and still on the shore 'y® 11 - of the lake, is Tabariyeh, or Tiberias, the capital of a district of the same name, with a castle on some high ground at the north-western extremity. It contains a fine mosque, once a Christian church, and two others; one of which is on the spot where Peter is supposed to have thrown his net. About 1000 Jews occupy a separate quarter, close to the lake, in the centre of the town; and there are about 3000 Turks, Arme nians, and others. The ancient city was between the present town and a spot remarkable for its warm springs; but the remains are trifling. On the right bank of the Jordan, eight miles southward of the lake, is Bei'san, a modern village of about 80 houses, with the ruins of an Acropolis on Tell Beisan; there are also those of a theatre, with some tombs, and other remains of Bethshean, the ancient Scythopolis. 3 1 De Bello Jud., Lib.

Besides the so-called Mount of Precipitation, in its vicinity, towards the south-east, tradition has fixed many other remarkable localities, such as the fountain of the Virgin, the workshop of Joseph, and the stone on which Christ dined with his disciples. On the northern crest of an arid ridge is an extensive Gothic castle, with some circular towers, probably constructed in the time of the Crusades: on its southern slope there is another, of more modern date; and between both, on some broken ground, forming three separate shoulders, is the town of Safet, or Japhet. This is about 20 miles north-eastward Town of Safet. of Nazareth, and is one of the four cities of Galilee so much venerated by the Hebrews; from its proximity to Esdraelon, as well as its singular position, it is probably also the site of Bethuliah. 1 It is neatly built, and contains about 700 houses, occupying the slopes in such a way that, in some 1 Judith, chap.

The former occupies the northern extremity of the peninsula, once an island, and also part of the neck of land which now connects the latter with the main. The town is tolerably clean, and contains one mosque, the ruins of an ancient Christian church, with nearly 700 houses, usually of one story, and about 2500 persons. The inhabitants obtain the requisite supply of water from two cisterns a little way outside of the town; and, as these are in an artificial isthmus, an opinion prevails that the supply comes from the fountains of Solomon, at Ras-el-Am. Remains of the On the side of the isthmus are the remains of the walls and one of the gates; part of the walls, with several columns and other vestiges of the ancient city, may also be traced along both the eastern and western side. The eastern buildings form one side of the small port, from which some trade is still carried on, chiefly in cotton and tobacco; and at the northern extremity is the fort and pharos constructed by the Crusaders. At the close of the eleventh century it was a pretty town, with a suburb ; and was famous for the manu facture of glass, earthen vessels, and white stuffs of superior 1 The castle and a great part of the city have since been destroyed by the terrible earthquake which visited this part of the country on the 1st January, 1831. 8 Jos., De Bello Jud., lib.

Of the more ancient city, however, there are few or no vestiges ; for it is doubtful whether or not the fountains already noticed, and part of an aqueduct, are such. About nine miles south-south-west is Cape Blanco, and Ancient road, the remarkable road called the Tyrian ladder; 4 and from hence an ancient paved road leads by Ras Nakhora to the celebrated Ka'iseriyeh, the Gath of the Philistines, sub sequently Csesarea, 5 which, as late as the time of Edrisi, was a large city, surrounded by suburbs, and defended by a strong citadel. 6 Portions of the walls, and of an aqueduct, with a temple and some granite columns, are the principal remains of 1 Edrisi, tome V., p. 314, Recueil de Voyages et de Memoires, &amp;c. 2 Rollin's Anc.

Jebei Mar The sides of the striking headland of Jebel Mar Elias present masses of limestone, partially shaded by olive and walnut trees; to these, higher up, succeed a variety of shrubs and odoriferous plants, forming in some places thick brushwood; which, however, becomes scanty towards the summit. The latter is occupied by a summer-house, erected by Abdu-llah Pasha, and by the Carmelite convent, overlooking the sea, at the western extremity. In the rock below the latter is the extensive grotto, supposed to be that of Elias, and many smaller excavations; and at the termination of the northern slope of the mountain are two castellated buildings, between which is Kaifa, probably Ephah, 2 a small walled town, with a mole and anchorage, defended by the lower castle. A little beyond the latter is the southern extremity of a fine bay, about nine miles in extent; on the northern horn of which stands Acre, the capital of the district. The Jezzar In addition to about 2500 stone-built terraced houses, Acre, properly Akka, contains a fine arched bazar, several mosques, khans,-baths, and other public buildings; amongst which may be noticed the arsenal, granary, and the Latin convent, which is a very large building ; also the Serai of the Pasha; and, nearly in the centre of the town, the Jezzar Jami'. The last, which is amongst the finest mosques in Asiatic Turkey, was constructed by the celebrated Pasha of that name (Jezzar, or Butcher) with ancient materials, chiefly brought from Kaisariyeh. The interior displays arabesque walls, partly covered with fine marble; and the exterior a grand cupola, a lofty minareh, a fine entrance portico, and a spacious court, with a fountain shaded by trees: a covered 1 Benjamin of Tudela, by A.

The Supply of Serai, once the Konak of the same Pasha, is a high castellated water ' keep, on which are mounted several guns; and it is situated in rear of the north land front: to this is joined the Harim, which, like the other part of the structure, has a high tower near the extremity, to serve as a place of retreat. The streets of the town are numerous and narrow ; and, in 1830, Acre had the cleanliness of a western city ; no camel, dog, or other animal being permitted to pass the inner ditch. The town was amply supplied with water, partly from cisterns and partly from the lowest slopes of the mountains, about four miles to the north-east; being brought by a conduit, on which, at short intervals, were towers, like those between Belgrade and Constantinople. Scarcely two miles further, towards the north-east, is the country-house of Abdu-llah, the former Pasha; which is prettily situated in the midst of gardens, and is remarkable for a mixture of Chinese, Turkish, and European architecture. At 1200 yards eastward of the town is the celebrated Cour de Lion Mount, on which Napoleon, and, subsequently, Ibrahim Pasha, caused some works to be constructed. The fortress of Acre covers a tongue of land running south- J^eof the westward into the sea, and its defences form an irregular en pentagon, with two fronts towards the land; the three others, which follow the contour of the peninsula, being washed by the sea. These consist almost entirely of a single escarp, from 27 The ramparts, feet to 31 feet high; with 81 guns, 13 mortars, and 9 how itzer guns, or 103 pieces of ordnance in all, to command the approach ; but the works are altogether defective with respect to flanking fire, and they are exposed to be enfiladed, especially the long front facing the west. The two land fronts have double, escarped, enceintes, which are separated by a dry ditch. The inner enceinte consists of an ordinary loop-holed Turkish wall, from 35 feet to 40 feet high, flanked by towers, and forming a salient angle as it crosses the peninsula. The shorter side runs nearly north from the bay for a distance ot 400 yards, when the longer makes with it a right angle, by J 3 q 2484 SIEGES SUSTAINED [CHAP, XIX.

Nearly the whole of the ramparts of the inner line, and a great part of those raised since the town was besieged by Buonaparte, are taken in reverse, at the height of 90 feet, by the fire of the castellated work already mentioned. The outer works, which were added by Jezzar Pasha after the memorable failure of the French general in 1799, consist of two bastioned fronts, with escarps from 30 to 40 feet high from the bottom of the ditch to the cordon, and earthen parapets; the ditch, which is dry, has a reveted counterscarp; there is also a tra versed covered way, and an imperfect glacis, defended by 53 guns of different calibres: in this fortress, a garrison of 3000 irregulars resisted the Egyptian fleet and army from the 20th of November, 1831, till the third bloody assault, ordered by Ibrahim Pasha, terminated, on the 27th of May, 1832, the protracted defence made by Abdu-llah Pasha. 1 Its remarkable position between Syria and Egypt must have given import ance to Akka, even at' the time of the Canaanites and Phoe nicians ; and the former here successfully resisted the tribe of Asher. 2 Powers which It appears to have had some privileges granted to it by have held the Alexander during the siege of Tyre ; and after the division of his empire it fell to the share of Ptolemy, who enlarged it and gave it the name of Ptolemais. 3 In the time of Augustus it had become a great city ; 4 and, in addition to the castle and mole near the south-eastern extremity, there are some vestiges of it a little way outside of the town, towards the east and south-east fronts. In 636 it fell into the hands of the Khaliph Omar; subsequently to which, during a period of more than 400 years, the Christians, and, amongst these, two English kings, contended for it with the Saracens, till at length, in 1517, after a protracted and honourable defence, made by the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, from whom it derived the 1 Three outworks were added on the land side, and some improvements of the defences were made by the Egyptians previously to the bombardment by the combined fleets on the 3rd of November, 1840. 2 Judges, chap.

The southern territory had before formed a dis trict which usually was independent of the other Pashaliks. in addition to the Mutesellimlik of El-Kuds, it contained the Melkana or appanages of Yafa, Ludd, and Ghuzzeh, or Gaza ; and its limits included the kingdoms of Samaria and Judea. Gaza touches the district of Akka a few miles southward of Kaiseriyeh ; having the Mediterranean on the west, the valley of the Jordan and of the Dead Sea on the east, and Arabia Petrsea on the south in about 30 24', N. Lat.; from whence the line runs northward along the territory of Egypt to the well of Kafa on the Mediterranean shore. At this spot, which is six hours' distance south of Gaza, are the re mains of ancient Raphia, 1 the last town of Syria, where two granite columns yet standing are supposed by the natives to mark the division between Africa and Asia. 2 1 Polybius, lib.

Towards the north, however, both the Nahr-el-Akhdar and the Nahr-Abu-Zabura enter the Mediterranean ; and seven miles southward of the latter, another called El-Nahr-Arstif, also enters that sea. This stream flows from the mountains of Samaria, in which it has two affluents; the northern branch rising near Sanur, and the southern westward of Nabulus. A little short of Yafa is the Nahr Aujeh, which flows in a northerly direction from Ludd, along the side of the plain of Sharon, and at length making a bold sweep W. and W.S.W., it proceeds through the latter into the sea. Between Yafa and Askulan is the Nahr Rubin, with ^ Nah^ two very small streams; and at the latter place is the river of the same name, which has several affluents in the western hills of Judea; these having united, the trunk flows through W adi Simsim into the sea. Again, beyond Gaza are two winter streams, the one ei Nahr Beisan, flowing along Wadi-el-Sheria and the other through Wadi Deir. Towards the eastern side of the territory are Wadi Bireh and El Nahr Beisan ; and six miles southward of the latter is the river El Malik, which, as well as the others, falls into the Jordan; again, 16 miles southward is El Fariyah, which is formed by the Nahr Bidan and other affluents, whose sources are near the water-shed a little distance north of Nabulus. The other streams which run into the valley of the Jordan southward from El Ahmar to Wadi Fuwar skirt ing Jericho, as well as those which fall into the Dead Sea, only flow during part of the year. But although there is so little running water, there is a tolerable supply of this neces sary of life ; for the rains not only moisten the soil, but also fill the tanks and reservoirs with which the inhabitants now, as in former times, are 1 provided. As already noticed, 2 the principal ranges of the district are those of Camel and Gilboa to the north; the first makes from the sea a southern sweep, which is prolonged by the second into * Go into the land, and into all the fountains of water, &amp;C .-1 Kings, chap.

In addition to the Bedawins, who occupy nearly the whole of the eastern and part of the western side of the territory, many of the other inhabitants of Judea are half nomadic; the soil itself is inferior to that of Galilee, and, though gene rally fertile, it has that sterile appearance which in warm countries is the consequence of defective cultivation. Valleys of The valleys of Judea westward of Jerusalem are Wadi Suleiman, with those of Ismael, Abii Gosh, and Es Sumt or Elah, all partially cultivated, more particularly the last, in which it is supposed that David overcame Goliah. Towards Bethlehem are Wadi Mar Elias and Wadi-el-Ahmah; again, southward of that town are Wadi Khureitun, Wadi Tekua, and Wadi-el-Tuheishmeh ; the latter an irregular valley, which may be considered as being prolonged southward by that of Wadi-el-Khulil to some distance beyond Beersheba; it produces in many places fields of grain, fine grapes, and other fruits. 1 Immediately northward of Jerusalem is Wadi Jehosaphat, and beyond, those of Beit Hanina and Suweinit, both bending north; the latter being afterwards known as the stony valley of Bethel.

The former are numerous, and, like those in Judea, are generally surrounded by a wall, within which are flat-roofed stone-built houses, usually of one apartment only; but in Samaria the walls enclose gardens and fields.

Near the northern limits is Jenin, the Ginea of Josephus, 1 a town of about 400 houses, in the midst of gardens; and about 12 miles S.S.W. from thence, prettily situated on the slope of a high and almost isolated hill, is the extensive village of Sebustieh.

The modern Town and har- town of Yafa contains an old castle, a khan, a large convent bour of Yafa ' for the reception of pilgrims, likewise some small churches and mosques, and a large soap manufactory. It contains about 4000 Christians, with as many Muslim inhabitants, and nearly 1800 well-built houses covering the western and northern slopes of a hill which projects a little way into the sea. A natural breakwater, running N.N.E. along the shore, on which there appears to have been a quay or pier, forms a kind of harbour for small vessels on the south western side of the town ; there is also tolerable anchorage near the north-eastern side ; and the view presented from the sea by a succession of streets, consisting of dome-covered houses, with a rich belt beyond of nopal or cochineal, orange, and pomegranate trees, is particularly pleasing. As the port of Jerusalem, and the last fortified town of its fortifica- Syria, Yafa becomes an important although by no means a tl0n8 • strong place. The two sea fronts, forming part of an irregular hexagon, have a simple escarp wall, with scarcely any flanking defence. The four land fronts are, however, better flanked; but the escarp is low and badly built; a faussebray and ditch surround the whole; but the works, especially the southern and south-eastern fronts, are commanded from the ground near Sir Sidney Smith's bastion. These defects might be partially remedied, and the castle and other large buildings would provide the necessary accommodation for the garrison. Buonaparte carried Yafa by assault after a siege of three days; and some of the prisoners were afterwards shot by his order, on the ground that they had broken the parole previously given by them at Gaza. By the ancient Phoenicians the city was said to be ante- &gt; diluvian.; 1 and tradition assigns this spot as the place of the completion of the Ark.

A little westward of the Yafa gate there is a cistern 30 paces long by 25 paces wide and 20 feet deep, with steps at one angle to descend into it, and a roof resting upon Saracenic arches. Near the western side of the town are the remains of an enclosure like a court, within which is a square tower about 120 feet high, commanding an extensive view of the plain and surrounding country. This place has been supposed to be Arimathea; it was large, handsome, and flourishing in the time of Edrisi. 1 Lydda, or Two-and-half miles E.N.E. is Ludd or Lydda, once called Diospoiis.

It is an open town, seated on a tabular hill, and surrounded by fruit gardens hedged with prickly pears, amidst which, on the lower ground eastward and south-eastward, are the two villages or suburbs of Harrat-et-te-Jear and Sejaeth, which latter is between the town and Samson's Mount ; 9 and on the other side stretching northward is the largest olive grove in Palestine. 10 The population amounts to about 10,000 souls, 11 and till recently it was the seat of the local government. After Tyre had fallen, this place held out for two months against Alexander the Great, who was twice wounded during the siege. At the time of Sandy's visit in the seventeenth century there were some remains of a temple, probably that of Dagon, in the centre of the town ; and there were other ruins on the southern side. At the eastern side of the territory, not far from the sites Hebron, of Sodom and Gomorrah, are two remarkable places, Hebron and Beit-el-Lahm; the former, which is the more southern town, is prettily situated amidst olive plantations and pro- 1 Zephaniah, chap.

The three portions of the city, together with the intervening gardens, occupy both sides of a deep and narrow valley, extending N.N.W. and S.S.E., which was probably once the field of Machpelah. 1 It contains Population of about 8000 inhabitants, several mosques, two synagogues, some khans, baths, and 1500 stone dwellings; many of them with pointed arcades below, and having either terraced roofs or roofs covered with low cupolas. But the celebrated The great mosque, which is towards the north-eastern extremity, is the mosque. principal object in the place. At the northern side of the enclosure there is a flight of steps to the entrance of the building, which is a quadrangle surmounted by a cupola, and having minarehs; the high walls and pilasters around the court appear to be ancient, and these, as well as the body of the structure, are very plain. A descending passage leads to the basement story of the mosque, probably once the cave of Machpelah, in which were deposited the bones of Sarah and Abraham. On the eastern slope of the hill, to the northward of the mosque, are the remains of a castle; here, also, is the bazar, and the principal part of the town; the latter extending across the valley, and again along a portion of the western declivities. Northward, beyond some'gardens, there is another part of the town; and between these is a pool or reservoir, about 80 feet long by 50 feet wide, and 18 feet deep: in the bed of the valley, farther south, there is a second, called the lower pool, 2 which is 120 feet square and 20 feet deep, with a flight of steps at each angle.

A little way eastward of the town is the convent, an extensive pile of buildings, enclosed by very high walls, resembling those of a castle, with a small postern entrance, which is opened occa sionally. It is tenanted by Greek, Latin, and Armenian monks, having within the church of the first the gaudy structure erected for the second branch of its inmates by the Empress Helena. Below, there is a small grotto, with an altar in a recess, which is understood to be the cave of the cave of the Nativity, in Bethlehem Ephrata. On the western side of Natlv ' t&gt;- the valley is the presumed well of the mighty men ; 7 and a little way northward, the tomb of Rachel, covered with a Muslim cupola. Three miles south-west of this spot is Kal'at- el-Burak, having within it a pool, which possibly may be the shut-up or sealed fountain, 8 and is apparently the principal feeder of the three adjoining reservoirs. Being on the slope of the hill, they descend in succession, the bottom of the first being nearly on the same level as the surface of the second, which carries the surplus water into the third and lowermost. The last is 582 feet long by 207 feet wide at the east end, and 148 at the west, with a depth of 50 feet. 1 Gen., chap. XXXV., v. 27. 8 Gen., chap. XXIII., v. 2; Jud., chap. I., v. 10. s Josh., chap.

The central fountain is 423 feet long by 250 feet wide at the east end, 160 at the west, and 39 feet deep. The upper and smallest is 380 feet long, 236 feet wide at the east end, 229 feet wide at the west, and 25 feet deep. 1 An aqueduct carries a supply of fine water along the side of the hills to Bethlehem, as it formerly did to the once brilliant capital of the luxurious Solomon. When approached by the ordinary pilgrim route, Jerusalem has something of a desolate appearance, presenting at the top of a stony valley a range of turreted limestone walls, above which appear only a few of the most elevated dwellings, and some of the cupolas and minarehs; whilst, like most other eastern cities, the interior is but a succession of dull streets and dead walls, sloping eastward, interspersed, however, with gaudy churches and heavy-looking convents. But when raised from the heights near the eastern side, the effect is particularly striking, the whole city being seen from thence in complete detail. The Mount of Olives, or Jebel-el Tur, commands, to the southward, a view towards Bethlehem and some of the hill country of Judea; atfid eastward is seen part of the valley of Santa Saba, with the Dead Sea glittering beyond, at the foot of the mountains of Arabia Petrsea. But, westward, the scenery is still more remarkable; in this direction. Mount Olivet descends rapidly into the deep ravine of Kidron, on the slope near the bottom of which is the garden of Gethsemane, and a little lower the tomb of the Virgin Mary; also those of Jehoshaphat, Absalom, and Zachariah. 2 On the sloping crest beyond this deep and narrow valley stands the city itself; which, in addition to many public buildings, contains upwards of 3000 good houses, distributed in four separate quarters, which cover as many hills, the whole being enclosed by lofty walls, flanked by square towers. The city has the shape of an irregular lozenge, whose western side skirts the valley of Gihon, while its southern side runs along that of Ben Hinnom; the northern side is near the hill of Titus; 1 As given by Dr. Robinson: my measurements were in paces. 8 The son of Barachiah.CHAP. XX.] REMARKABLE BUILDINGS. 497 and, lastly, the eastern side runs almost north and south along the valley of Jehoshaphat, having in the centre the gate of St. Stephen : just southward of the latter, rising above the walls, is Mount Moriah, whose buildings are the fore ground and principal part of the panorama. The quadrangular terrace on which they stand occupies about one-fifth of the area of the city, being about 500 yards from north to south, with an average width of nearly 300 yards from east to west. Almost in the centre are the graceful minarehs of the mosque of Omar, which, with its arcades, courts, and innermost enclosure, almost rivals the great and costly edifice of Solomon, which it has replaced. The body of the Kubbet es Sukhrah, or Dome of the Rock, Dome of the is octagonal, very spacious, and of Arabian architecture; its Rock ■ eight sides being much ornamented with bright coloured porcelain and rich fret-work, and it is surmounted by a spacious cupola. Beneath the latter is the celebrated Hadjar, the concealed stone of the Muslims, who designate the whole enclosure El Harim (the holy) ; also El Harim esh Sherif, (the noble sanctuary). On the same terrace, a little way southward, there is another The Mesjid-ei but inferior building, designated, par excellence, the Mesjid- Aksa ' el-Aksa, 1 which has a portico of seven arches, with a glittering arabesque cupola, and is supposed to occupy the site of a very ancient place of worship. The extensive crypts and gateway below this building are undoubtedly ancient, and the arches apparently Roman, probably of the age of Herod. 2 Extending from Mount Moriah towards the northern and north-western walls, is the second and inferior quarter of the town, which, with its gardens and olive groves, covers the hill of Bezetha. Akra, the third and most extensive division, touches the 'Akra. preceding quarters on their western sides, and has in its centre the three domes of the Holy Sepulchre; a little way from thence are the Greek, Syriac, and Coptic convents, and 1 Ordinarily this means a mosque, with all its enclosures. s Mrs. Bonomi; see Hogg's visit to Alexandria, p. 282, &amp;c.

On the higher ground beyond, and Castle of, almost touching the walls, is the castle of David; northward David • of which, on the most elevated spot in the city, is the Latin convent; and about the same distance southward, on lower ground, is that of the Armenians, a less conspicuous but still more extensive pile of building, with a large garden reaching to the gate of Sion. On the southern and eastern slopes of this hill are the remains of the aqueduct of Solomon, and below is the valley of Hinnom, which falls into that of Jehoshaphat, or Kidron; the former contains the lower pool of Gihon, and the latter that of Siloam, with the village of the same name. On the summit of Mount Zion are some mosques and other Turkish buildings, in the midst of which are the tomb of David, the place of the Last Supper, and the house of Caiphas. This hill, which is the southernmost and smallest of the four belonging to the ancient city, appears to the left of the temple, outside of the present walls, and it completes the remarkable cowp-cTceil which is formed by the houses, convents, churches, gaudy domes, and graceful minarehs of Jerusalem, these being thrown out with a clearness which belongs to nature only in that region. Magnitude of The circumference of the present city is about two miles the city. anc j a half. thg western side extends from Mount Zion to a distance of 800 paces along the valley of the Gihon, and the eastern side to nearly 950 along that of Jehoshaphat; whilst the northern and southern sides join their extremities by two lines, which run in a slanting or north-eastern direction. Besides the gate already noticed on the east, there are five others, viz., that of Yafa or Bethlehem on the west, the Zion and Dung gates on the south, and finally those of Herod and Damascus on the north. Between these, a little way north, is the grotto of Jeremiah; at some distance farther are the extensive and well-finished sepulchral excavations called the Tombs of the Kings; and a little onward those of the Judges; these last are smaller than the others, and their architecture is greatly inferior. Owing to the space occupied by the public buildings, the number of private houses in Jerusalem is comparatively few;CHAP. XX.] ANCIENT SITE AND NAME. 499 and in 1830 the population scarcely exceeded 15,000 souls, of Population, whom more than one-third were Muslims; the rest are com posed of Jews and different sects of Christians, the last being rather more numerous than the sons of Abraham. At the south-west corner of the Mesjid-el-Aksa are the remains of the bridge mentioned by Josephus as crossing the valley of the Tyropceon; and portions 1 of the former walls Traces of wails, may likewise be traced at intervals along the eastern and western sides of the present city. There are some massive remains near the southern side of Mount Zion, and others considerably to the northward of the gates of Damascus and Herod; it is evident, therefore, that the ancient walls must have enclosed almost double the space occupied by the modern city; and they probably had a circumference of about 3| geographical miles. 2 The time of founding the city is supposed to be at least as Earliest site, remote as that of Melchizedeck, who met Abraham near this place, then called Salem (Peace), 3 and it appears to have then occupied two of the hills, Mounts Akra and Zion. About 1879, B.C., the city was taken by the Jebusite branch of the Canaanites, who built the fortress called Jebus on Mount Zion; and the compound, Jebus-Salem, is supposed to have given rise to the present name. 4 The two northern portions of the city were taken by Sanctity of the Joshua B.C. 1442; 5 but 400 years elapsed before David took 0117 ' the castle on Mount Zion. 6 That the neighbouring hill of Mount Moriah had previously been sacred, is evident from its having been chosen as the place for the sacrifice of Isaac, and from the command given to Dan to rear an altar there. Herodotus himself gives it the name of Cadytis, 7 or the Holy; and this epithet it retains to the present time, being called Kuds-el-Sherif (Sanctuary of the Just), and Bei't-el-Macaddes 1 Jos., De Bello Jud., lib.

Herod the Great adorned the city; and with it the whole of Judea became a Roman province under his grandson (Agrippa II.); the subsequent revolt of the Jews brought about its siege and destruction by Titus, a.d. 70. 3 Adrian rebuilt the city on the site it now occupies, and in less than three centuries the name of Jerusalem was almost lost, that of Elia Capitolina, given by Adrian, being substi tuted for it. In 613 it was taken by the Persians, from whom, fourteen years later, it was recovered by the Greeks. In 636 it capitulated to the Khaliph 'Omar, by whom, seven years afterwards, the great mosque was erected on the site of the temple. The Crusaders occupied the city from its capture in 1099 till it was taken by Salah-ed-din in 1188. 4 After wards it was subject to the Latin princes, then to the Egyptians, and finally to the Turks. But with the exception of a trifling tax, now understood to be abolished, and rigid exclusion from the mosque of 'Omar, the Christians and Hebrews have long enjoyed the privilege of flocking to the Holy City. The former, to deplore the loss of their magni ficent Temple ; and the latter, to witness the dust of Calvary covered with a gaudy structure. The portal of the structure is guarded by Turkish cavasses, and its interior is occupied by Latin, Greek, and Armenian churches, in addition to several small chapels placed around the Holy Sepulchre, for the use of the Maronites, Jacobites, Coptic, Abyssinian, and Georgian Christians. 1 Ibn Haukal, p. 37, Sir W.

XX.] PASHALIK OF DAMASCUS. 501 The Pashalik of Damascus includes the remainder of the Limits of the Syrian territory, and even within its ordinary limits it is the pa8h41lk * most extensive district of the country; but occasionally both Gaza and Tripoli have been considered as Eyalets under its jurisdiction. The government of Sham, in its restricted limits, has on the west the Pashaliks of Tripoli, Akka, and Gaza; on the north it touches that of Aleppo; on the east it is bounded by Arabia Deserta; and finally, on the south it touches Arabia Petrsea. It extends from the last about 275 miles in length, with a breadth, according to the existing boundary (from the Anti-Lebanon eastward to the valley of Palmyra), of about 85 miles. Along the western side of the districts are the valleys of Features of the the Jordan and Bika, also several offset branches from the country ' ranges closing their eastern sides; some of these branches run a good way into the interior. And one of these, the Jebel-el Jusche, quitting the slopes of the Anti-Lebanon, under the name of Jebel Salahiyah, passes Damascus in a north-easterly direction, and then separates into three branches; one, called El Utala Safire, takes an eastern direction ; whilst the others, as the Jebel Ruak and Jebel Kassium, run north-eastward beyond Tadmor, showing bare rocky ridges tinged with deep purple, and a lofty serrated crest. With these exceptions, and the rocky tracts. El Ledja, &amp;c,, southward of Damascus, also some undulating hills elsewhere, the central and northern parts of the Pashalik may be considered as one level tract, which, under the name of the plain of Djolan, commences a little way eastward of Tabariyeh, and is succeeded by that of Djedur. This last plain, which runs along Jebel es Sheikh, although occasionally broken by undulating ground, continues northward, passing by Damascus, Hums, and Hamah, till it meets the Pashalik of Aleppo, when it proceeds eastward from the foot of the Anti-Lebanon to the Arabian desert; thus forming, between the latter and the mountains, an inter mediate plateau, about 2000 feet high. In general the soil is rather light, but very good, especially in the valleys of the Orontes and Jordan, which are partially cultivated; but although equally susceptible of cultivation towards the eastern502 RIVERS OF THE pisHALIK. [CHAP. XX. side, the latter is almost entirely pasture ; grain being the exception in the Ledja and some other tracts. The rivers and valleys of this extensive district are numerous; The Barrada. but in general the former do not reach the sea. The Barrada, one of the most important, has its northern source at Am-el- Hawra Ujmt, from whence it flows southward along the Anti- Lebanon ; and in the plain three miles eastward of Zibdeni it receives a short affluent flowing through that place. The trunk then makes a tortuous course in an east-south-easterly direction through a rich valley, alternately bordered by bold rocks and wooded hills. It passes the village of Souk, where there are some remarkable excavations; then that of Abila, and subsequently those of Dei'r Kamar and El Faidja, when it receives a fine stream, the Ain-el-Faidja, 1 and carries onward a considerable body of water; but on approaching Damascus a bifurcation of this river, the ancient Chrysorrhoas, takes place. One branch passes near Jebel Salahiyah, and along the northern side of the city, 2 whilst the southern is directed into eight different channels, 3 which, after watering the city and fertilizing its extensive gardens, re-unite a little beyond; Abana and and the trunk, probably the Abana, or Amana, 4 is joined by piiarpar. ^ nort j lern branch, possibly the Pharpar, 5 which has also been greatly diminished by irrigation. 6 Shortly afterwards, the trunk enters the marshes and Lake of Bahr-el-Merdj Atibe, receiving just previously on its southern side the Nahr-el-Berde, and another tributary, the Awaadj Kisweh. The former descends from the district of Rasheia in two branches, which unite at the foot of Jebel Rabusieh, from whence the trunk makes a tortuous course; first eastward * 1 Edrisi, p. 350, tome V., Recueil de Voyages, &amp;c. 3 Plurimi tamen Damascum ex epoto riguis amne Chrysorrhoa fertilem.— Pliny, lib.

The other and larger stream rises on the slope of Jebel Heisch, from whence, with a full stream, it flows to the north-east, passing El Kessue, and winding onward through undulating and usually bare hills, into the Barrada, a little below the former. The lake in which these and the former streams terminate, spreads eastward for about 9 miles, with an average width of nearly two miles; the other streams in this district being of inferior size, it will be best to notice them in describing the country southward. This tract, the ancient Persea, in the largest sense, contains Extent of Jebel Belad-el-Belka on the south, Jebel Ajlun, El Kura, &amp;c., on es Szaffa ' the west, Belad Haouran and four rocky districts to the north, of which the most distant is Jebel es Szaffa. The latter ex tends from Jebel Haouran northward to the plain of Damascus in the form of a parallelogram of about 20 miles in length by six miles in width; and, being without springs, it has no other supply of water than that of ponds and cisterns, which are filled during the rainy seasons. The centre of this district consists of an extensive plain, two days' journey in circuit, enclosed by a ridge of volcanic rocks, generally forming irre gular masses of broken ledges heaped together; amongst which, however, are small patches of pasture, and occasionally a little cultivation. The entrance into this singular tract is through a narrow pass between high perpendicular cliffs, called El Bab es Szaffa, which is about two yards wide. 1 On the eastern slopes is the tract called El Rohba, which ei Rohba. contains some ruined villages ; and at the western side there is another tract named El Harra, to indicate the nature of its surface, which is covered with small-sized stones. Stretching along the south-western side are the plain and ei Lowa. valley of El Lowa, both watered by a river of the same name. The latter rises on the south-western slope of Tell Schiehan, and flows northward by the ruined town of Om Ezzeitun, which is partially occupied by about forty families of Druses. 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, pp. 93, 661.504 EL LOWA AND EL LEDJA. [CHAP. XX. Ruins at Om It is situated on a low hill, and has a circumference of about Ezzeitun. ^ wo m ii es&gt; There are some inscriptions, with the ruins of two inferior temples, one of which is of the Ionic order, and a reservoir of about thirty feet diameter, probably once a crater, which has been increased by excavating the rock. In the centre is the shaft of a column, intended to show the depth of water. The stream continues to make a tortuous course north westward along this fine valley, which displays in many places luxuriant herbage, and passes the villages of Essamera, Om Haretein, El Hadher, Khelkeir, Meharetein, El Hazzem, and Essura, from whence it inclines rather eastward of north, and terminates in the Bahret-el-Merdj. Besides the preceding places, which are only occasionally inhabited, the extensive plain on each side of the Lowa contains many interesting re mains, such as the castle and temple of Sour; the extensive ruins of Soneira ; and also some at the villages of Hyatti, El Hait, and Mejaddan ; but at present there are little more than the pastures of the Arabs, and some small spots cultivated by the Druses, in the intervals between the masses of volcanic rocks. The surface of The Ledja extends westward from the preceding valley to the Ledja. 0 f Loehf. It is rather larger than Es Szaffa, and although the soil is stony, it contains several pasture tracts and some cultivation, particularly in the outer portion of the district. The interior is occupied by the Selman, the Medledj, the Szolout the Dhouhire, and the Siale tribes of Arabs, who breed a vast number of goats. 1 Some of them also keep a few sheep and cows, and occasionally sow wheat and barley in certain spots. The surface of the greater part of the Ledja presents a labyrinth of volcanic rocks cleft asunder in various shapes, but generally forming a series of concentric circles, separated by fissures from 15 to 20 feet deep, through which, by any stranger at least, an exit is found with extreme diffi culty. This tract represents the north-western part of the rugged Trachonites, 2 in whose rock-bound recesses the Arabs 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 111. 2 Strabo, lib. XVI., p. 155.* CHAP. XX.j RUINS OF PHCENESUS. 505 pitch their tents with the same degree of security which this country gave them in the time of Herod's government. 1 Towards the S.S.E. limits of this remarkable country Ruins at Mis- are the villages of Darra, Djeha, and Keine el Loehf, at theS s orPhoe * last of which are some ruins and inscriptions. In the centre ^ are those of Anchere, Deir Dhami, Stir, Djeddel, and Dama, the last being the principal place, and at its northern limits are the ruins of ancient Phcenesus, now the deserted town of Missema. Its walls have a circumference of nearly three miles, and it contains the ruins of several public buildings, amongst which may be noticed those of a handsome temple with a Doric portico, and a roof supported by four Corinthian columns ; some inscriptions are also found on the spot. About a mile to the eastward there is a conical-shaped solid stone building, 24 feet in circumference and 15 feet high, with a spiral staircase outside leading to the top; but no inscription was found to show whether the structure was sepulchral or had some other object. Towards the north-western limits of the district are the vil- Ancient build- lages and ruins of Zebair, Zebir, Adzim, Sur, and some other kT at Zebair ' inconsiderable places, which are alike ruinous, and apparently similar in construction; they are here called Haush, meaning a defensible village.

The better sort of the dwellings have one court, and sometimes a second, with apartments about it; but in general the houses are small, with heavy roofs of stone slabs, which are of sufficient length to reach from the side walls to the top of one which extends along the middle of the building, or to the top of an elliptical arch supported by columns, in a like position. The doors are, or were, of one slab of cut stone, seven inches thick, turning on stone pivots, let into the cap and ground sills; and an iron chain passing through slanting apertures secured the door inside.

The third, Ezra, is the principal town of the district, and has a most singular situation, being built in the midst of a mass of volcanic rock. It contains two hundred Turkish, some Druse, and a few Christian families, who live principally in the ancient buildings ; their chief occupation being to prepare millstones and weave cotton stuffs. In addition to the private dwellings, which for the most part are in good preservation, there are the remains of palaces and other public buildings, some of which at a later period have been used as churches.

Not far from the source of this stream stands the small Corinthian Temple of Salem in ruins, with some other remains scattered around. Onward, near the right bank, is the Druse village of Nejran, which contains some ancient buildings with stone doors ; and on the opposite side of the stream the founda tions of ancient Keratha, or Gerasa; still further on are the Druse villages of Kerbert-Hariri and Busser. In the other branch of the Loehf, are the villages of El Medjidel, Tebuc, Bossin, and Shaara. The last must at one time have been a considerable place, but its inhabitants are now reduced to 100 Druse and Christian families. It contains some inscriptions, the ruins of several large large buildings, and one of the square watch-towers which are so common in this part of Syria. NArAC€WOY AAYCO€C€AnYCHAP.

One of these is watered by the Moiet Maaz, which flows eastward from Kelb Haouran and then south-westward along the foot of the mountains, into the plain near Bozra; but the principal water-courses flow west ward. Towards the north is Nahr Kanouat, which, as already noticed, waters the Loehf, and nearly in the centre are the two branches of the Nahr Nedam; the northern of which flows from Ain-el-Merdj by Soneida into the southern branch coming from Kuffer. The trunk thus formed winds westward, till near the extremity of the plain it is joined by a tributary coming from the vicinity of Aaere; and these together 2 form the principal branch of the Jarmuk, or Sheriat- The Jamuk. el-Mandhier. These mountains are almost entirely occupied by branches of the Druses, and the plains westward by the Bedawins. The former live in villages and towns chiefly con taining clay-built dwellings, constructed near or upon the sites of ancient cities ; and although the buildings are humble, they appear to be neat and cleanly. The Bedawins vary in number from 80 to 200 families, or more, who occupy ancient houses of the description already given ; they rarely contain more than a single apartment, and the number of these ruined towns show that this tract was at one time thickly peopled. On the flanks of this tract are the towns of Sueida and Zaele; the latter is situated on the slope at the commence- 1 Probably Mount Alsadaxnus of Ptolemy, lib.

The former town is seated on a declivity of some high ground on the western side of Jebel Haouran, and its ruins cover a space of nearly four miles in circumference. It is supplied with water from several Birkets, two of which are very large ; and a good deal of cotton and tobacco are grown by the Druses, who partially occupy the ancient buildings; of these there remains part of a street with arches, apparently for shops on each side. The ruins consist of part of a temple like that of Kanouat, with a crescent-shaped building, probably once a fountain, containing three niches. There is also a solid struc ture 30 feet square and 26 feet high, with six Doric pilasters on each side. There may have been an entrance and a sepul chre in this part of the building, and the roof probably terminated pyramidically. The angles, and not the sides, of the structure face the cardinal points of the horizon, and there is a Greek inscription on the north-eastern wall; several other inscriptions occur in different parts of the ruins, and one of them is in Hebrew. Remains at On the south-eastern slope is the ruined town of Maaz, in Ayeen. a ver y romantic and secluded spot, shaded by willows, 2 and almost five miles south-eastward is Ayeen, which contains about 400 families, with two springs walled in, and the re mains of four public buildings, 3 on one of which there is a Greek inscription.

There is a spring at this place, and several inscriptions.

In cer tain places at the western side of the tract, but more particu larly towards the south, there are masses of basalt ; the prevailing formation, however, is limestone without streams of water, and almost entirely deprived of trees. Cultivation appears occasionally near the villages, but the rest of the sur face is covered with scanty herbage, barely sufficient for the camels, sheep, and goats of the Arabs and Druses.

The Pasha of Damascus intrusts the local government to the Druse Sheikhs, but they endeavour to appease rather than control the Bedawins, and the plains become in consequence common property. From May to September especially, they are covered with the El Fuhaily, the Es Sudiyeh, the El Aisy, the Beni Szakher, the Serhhan, 2 the Hammame, the Aniza, and other tribes of Arabs. Towards the northern extremity of this wide-spreading plain ei Mezarieb, are the villages of Ghabarieb, Didy, and Ba'al Me'on, now or Ashtaroth - called Es Szananamein, or the Images. 3 The first has a ruined castle and reservoir, and the last, which is of consi derable extent, contains the ruins of several buildings, also two square towers, and some Greek inscriptions y Nearer the- centre are El Harra, Om-el-Mezabel, the town of Eshmiskin, or Shemskein, which has a bridge, and is of some extent, being considered the second place in the Haouran. A little way towards the interior is El Mezareib, the ancient Ashtaroth ; 4 south of which is Susim, or Sisim. 5 Mezareib contains a number of springs, and is considered the third place in the Haouran; but it is more remarkable as the first halting-place of the Mekkah caravans, and for the warehouses contained in the castle; to which are annually sent ample supplies of wheat, barley, biscuit, rice, tobacco, horse furniture, and am munition, all separately kept for the use of the Pasha and his suite when taking charge of the pilgrims. South-westward are El Hereyik, El Herak, Melihat-el- Remtha, or Ghazale, Daara, and Tell Hussein ; and, southward, Eleneh Amathus - and Remtha. 6 The last contains about 100 houses, each partly a cavern; and it occupies several calcareous hills: in 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 305. s Ibid., pp. 306, 301. 3 Dr. Zunz on the Geography of Palestine, p. 405. 4 Colonel Leake's Preface to Burckh., p. xii. 5 Ibid., 407. 6 Ibid., 407.512 the decapolis.

Decapoiis. The country lying westward of the latter, and stretching northward from the river Zerka, or Jabok, to a little beyond the Jarmuk, represents the ancient districts of Galaaditis, Sueta, and part of Batanea; these, together, nearly comprise the territory of the Decapoiis, and the land of Gilead; part of which was allotted to Gad, and the remainder to the half- tribe of Manasseh. Features of the Near its western limits, from north to south, are the small country. mountain districts of El Kefarat, El Kura, Jebel Ajlun, and Moerad; and, at the eastern side, those of Belad, Ebad-el- Bottein, Belad Beni Obeid, Ez Zueit, Jebel Zerka, and Ard- el-Bethinyeh. These tracts consist of low chains of rounded mountains, separated by fine valleys, watered by perennial streams. Towards the north, the latter flow nearly east and west, but more southward they incline W.S.W., terminating, like the preceding, in the valley of the Jordan ; whilst the winter streams near the extremity flow southward into the valley of the Zerka or Jabok. The highest portions of the mountain ranges are towards the centre, about Jabesh Gilead, Jebel Ajlun, and, towards the north, over-hanging the valley of the Jarmuk. Occasionally the slopes are bare, but in general they are very picturesque, being covered with syca more, the wild olive, acacia, oak, and other trees, with under wood of arbutus, myrtle, and oleander, well stocked with nightingales. inhabitants.

The principal sites in the Decapolis are Arbat, Capitolias Abila, Om Reis, Gadara, and Gamala. The first has a castle and fine reservoir at the village of Irbid, the second is supposed to be near the ruined village of Mar Elias, the third is one hour and a half north-east of Hebras, and the fourth and fifth are not far from the Lake of Tiberias. The extensive ruins of Ruins at Om Om Reis occupy an elevated and rocky ridge, which, from the Gadira robably southern side, overlooks the valley of the Jarmuk, or Hiero- max, and also commands a view of part of the southern ex tremity of Lake Tiberias. They consist of two theatres, two temples, part of a colonnade, numerous finely-executed sar cophagi, and other remains, probably those of ancient Gadara, which was situated in the region of Scythopolis, with its villages on the borders of Lake Tiberias, 1 opposite to the plain of Esdraelon; 2 the Jarmuk flowing before it. 3 The position of the ruins nearly corresponds with the assigned distance of Gadara from Scythopolis; and this city, also called Gedor, was on the south side of the above-mentioned river. 4 Ves pasian took it by storm, after a brief siege. 5 The remains of Gamala, a city so celebrated for its pro- Gamala. tracted resistance against the same emperor, 6 are over against Tarichaea, on the opposite side of the lake, and are probably those near Kefr Harob, not far from its eastern shore. The city was on a high and abrupt mountain, which has 'Ajiun. been aptly compared to a camel, 7 being steep on each side. On the crest of Jebel Ajlun (Eglon) 8 is Kal' at el Rabba, or Ajlun, one of the structures of the middle ages; and on its northern slopes are Jabesh Gilead and Pella: on its south western side is Amatha (Amathus); and, on the southern, 1 Vita Josephi, sec. 9 and 10. 8 Polybius, lib.

This village contains about 40 clay-built houses, and Souf - is the principal place in the picturesque district called Moerad at the western side of Wadi El Deir. In the neighbourhood there is an ancient square building, on which are some inscrip tions ; and close to the village are several caverns ; here, also, three copious springs issue from beneath a rock, and, soon uniting, they have the name of the Keruan: at one hour s distance south-eastward the stream flows through Jerash. Remains at The walls of ancient Gerasa form an irregular parallelo- Jerash - gram along both sides of this stream ; but the most interesting portions of the remains extend from north-east to south-west, along the right bank. At the latter extremity there is a fine triumphal arch, a naumachia, a theatre, and a small temple: in front of this last is a spacious semicircular colonnade, from which the remains of a street maybe traced, in a north-easterly direction, to the extremity of the town; the columns are of different sizes on each side, and display two orders of archi tecture. This street is crossed at right angles by one almost in the centre, and by two others nearly equidistant from it. The first of the three is a little way northward of the centre, and it runs from a bridge over the stream towards some high ground north-westward, on which are the remains of a very fine Corinthian temple, with a double row of columns in front, and a single row along the three other sides. The second, which is parallel to the former, has in the centre an open rotunda, with four entrances, a theatre at the north-western, and an arched building, probably a palace, at the south-eastern extremity; and the third has in the centre four large cubical masses of stone, like those in the middle of the great portico at Palmyra; it has also a ruined building, with the remains of a small transverse street at the north-western and a fine bridge at the south-eastern extremity. Not far from the latter there is an extensive arched building, possibly a palace ; which is the principal ruin on the left bank of the river. The higher parts of the ground on each side are occupied with the remains of private dwellings ; and, beyond these, on the north western side, there is an extensive necropolis, displaying a number of finely-executed sarcophagi.

Having the affluents of the Arnon to the south, those of streams, the Zerka on the north, and in the centre the streams falling into Wadi Shaib, Wadi Seir, and Wadi Hasban, this tract may be considered as well watered, except towards its eastern limits, where cisterns become the principal resource of the inhabitants. This part of the country consists of level pasture tracts, which are almost exclusively occupied by the Bedawins. Towards the centre are prettily rounded hills, with villages at intervals; and from thence, almost t;o the Jordan, are low mountains^ bearing forests of oak, olive, and arbutus, with abundance of flowers, and constituting a pleasing landscape. The modern towns of this district are few, and the ruins Modern towns, less interesting than in other parts of Syria.

On a round hill, a little way northward, is the site of El Aal, probably the Elealeh of Scripture. 3 Near the northern limits is the small town of Zey, situated on the slopes of Jebel Jal'ad, also the ruined towns of Jel'ad and Jelaloud; and a few miles southward is Es Szalt, the Castle of Szalt. principal place in the district of El Belka. The castle occupies the crest, and the town both sides of a singular ridge, or tongue of land, projecting into a deep valley, or rather basin, enclosed by lofty hills overlooking the whole. The castle is a respectable work, insulated on the land side by means of a ditch, and having a second or interior line of defence. Szalt contains about 200 Christian and nearly 300 Turkish houses, usually small, and having flat roofs resting upon an arch, like the ancient buildings in the Haouran ; the streets are narrow and dirty, and form successive terraces. The slopes on the opposite or south-western side of the valley are clothed with terraced olive-groves, and those on the north-western with vineyards, in which are watch-towers: above are three rounded hills, the highest of which commands 1 Possibly Kerjathaim.—Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 367. 8 Dr. Zunz on the Geography of Palestine, p. 409. 8 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 365; Isaiah, chap.

Among the ruins of both are those of a colonnade, and also of a bridge, with a space between them for public exhibitions. A little lower, near the opposite bank of the river, which has walls like quays on each side, and is paved at the bottom, there is a remarkable building, probably a public walk; it consists of high walls, forming a half hexagon, facing the west; on which side there is a fine colonnade, and a beautiful arch in 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 354. 2 Ibid., 355. 8 Ibid., 356. 4 Jeremiah, chap.

On the slope of the opposite or northern hill are some excavations, and on its crest the remains of an acropolis, a massive quadrangular building, containing some cisterns. Close to it there is part of a Corinthian temple, and other remains, with a portion of the ancient walls enclosing this part of the hill.

Besides those which skirt the Dead Sea, the principal mountains in this tract, once the land of Moab, are Jebel Urukaraiyeh, Jebel Tarfuyeh, and Jebel-el-Ghuweitheh, which almost make a consecutive sweep from the mountains near the southern extremity of that sea to the upper part of the river Arnon, which once separated the kingdoms of the Moabites and Ammonites. The valley of the latter, or Mojeb, is exceedingly wild and striking: from the verdant stripe through which the river flows, steep and barren rocky banks, with thinly scattered shrubs, rise to a great height, forming a deep and seemingly impracticable chasm. 1 Nearly in the centre is the principal stream, which, after the junction of its two branches—one passing near the northern and the other not far from the southern side of the Kerak— flows westward down the Wadi-el-Deraah into the Dead Sea: its banks are covered, in profusion, with the palm, acacia, aspen, and oleander. 8 Northward, almost midway to the Mojeb, is Wadi Hemad, which has a west-south-western 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 372. 8 Irby and Mangles' Travels, p. 359.CHAP.

From its source, near the castle of El Ahsa, the Nahr-el-Assal, or Honey River, 1 flows westward between Kerak and Jebal; taking, in the lower part of its course, the name of the Kurahy ; and, owing to a hot spring, called the Bath of Solomon, which empties itself into the main stream, the latter becomes almost tepid, 2 The valley of El Ahsa resembles that of Mojeb, but is less ei ahsa. rugged, as the stream flows for the most part through a deep and narrow bed of rocks overgrown with the defle shrub: this stream probably represents the Zared of Scripture, the boundary between the Edomites and Moabites. 3 The surface of Kerak is less hilly than that which is on the north of the Anion (El Belka), but still it is more diversified than the country lying eastward and north-eastward. In some places it is eminently fertile; and although nearly the whole surface is at present a wilderness, or contains only the pasture tracts of the Bedawins, the numerous remains of former culti vation, the many ancient sites and Roman mile-stones, give abundant proofs of the populousness of the whole region in former times. Besides the plains lying eastward between the mountains of Central pia- Tarfuyeh and the borders of Arabia, there appears to be a kind teau ' of plateau in the centre of the country, the northern part of which, called El Kura, extends from the valley of Mojeb almost to the foot of Jebel Attarus, in the Belka; and this probably represents the plains of Moab ; 4 the latter retained the name after the northern part of the territory was taken by the Amorites, to whose country this portion properly belonged. With some exceptions, the plain in question is also prolonged from the valley of the Mojeb southward, through the centre 1 Irby and Mangles' Travels, p. 359. 2 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 401. 3 Irby and Mangles' Travels, p. 444. 4 Numbers, chap.

Stretching along the southern and eastern shore of the Dead Sea, there is another level tract called the Ghaw-arineh, which is lower than the former, and is celebrated for the cultivation of tobacco ; one portion, the Ghor-el-Mezrah, projects so far that at times this part of the Dead Sea is fordable. In general the tract is covered with quite a forest composed of the Osher 1 and other trees already noticed, 2 amidst which are clusters of huts constructed with reeds and rushes, or canes, forming square-shaped villages; about these are fields of tobacco and grain, with some pasture land. 3 The principal set tlement of the Ghaw-arineh is close to the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and the situation of the village Ghor-el- Szafe corresponds with that of Zoar. 4 Indigo is a common production of the Ghor; it produces also a kind of honey, and Assal Berouk manna. 5 From the banks of the river Arnon a Roman road runs south- westward to Bei't Kerim, a ruined city with a temple of remote antiquity, 6 and numerous tanks. 7 The road or causeway proceeds in the same direction to Rabba, where it terminates. This appears to have been the site of the capital, Ariel of Moab, or Rabbath Moab, afterwards Areopolis, whose remains consist of a ruined temple, two cisterns, and several buildings, public and private, within a circumference of about two miles. 8 About ten miles southward of the ancient is the modern capital of Kerak, once Ker-Moab, and at a later period Cha- racmoba. It occupies a steep hill surrounded by a deep and narrow valley, which is itself encircled with mountains. The town has ruinous walls and towers, and some inscriptions, with a castle at its western extremity, and an entrance excavated in the rock ; 2 but some fragments of granite columns are the only remains of antiquity. Kerak is still a bishoprick, and it has 1 Asclepias gigantea vel procera.—Dr. Robinson's Biblical Researches, &amp;c., vol.

The town contains inhabitants of about 150 Christian and 400 Turkish families ; the former are the town ' descendants of refugees from Jerusalem, Bethlehem, &amp;c., who are free from all exactions ; and the latter originally came from the mountains of Hebron and Nabulus. A sheikh governs Kerak, but he has no greater authority in the town than a Be- dawin chief has over his tribe. The inhabitants are so remark able for their hospitality that the town is almost always filled with guests, especially the Bedawms, who delight in living well at the expense of others. 1 The Kerakein intermarry with the Bedawins, with whom they live on good terms; and in some cases they receive from the latter a small tribute annually. Three or four houses are generally built in the same court yard, and they have flat roofs resting on two arches like those of the Haouran. The narrow ravine southward of Kerak contains caverns and wrought tombs, with recesses for sarcophagi. 2 Four or five miles E.S.E. are the ruins of Ruins of Dethas, with a temple, some ordinary Roman buildings, and Dethas ' many cisterns. 3 In the line southward of Kerak is Ain Ferayn, a fine spring, with a ruined city near it; and two miles further is Ketharabba, a village surrounded by gardens, and containing both stone dwellings and the tents of the Beni Ammer. 4 Six miles farther is Oerak, a similar village of equal size; and between this and the borders is one of more considerable magnitude, called Khanzir. This place occupies the declivity Khanzir. of one of the highest mountains on the eastern side of the Dead Sea, and in its neighbourhood are many streams which water the fields ; there is also an extensive tract of gardens in which a portion of the inhabitants are constantly encamped with their cattle ; 5 the whole are under tents in the time of harvest. The preceding, together with El Belka, El Moerad, and the rest of the districts already noticed, represent Persea Proper, the Decapolis, Batanea (Bothi'n), also the Gaulonitis, Auranitis, Iturea, and Trachonitis, of the ancients; that is, 1 Burckhardt's Travels, pp. 379—385. 8 Irby and Mangles' Travels, p. 369. 3 Ibid., p. 372. * Ibid., p. 396, 5 Ibid., pp. 397, 398.

The remainder of the Pashalik is the extensive tract spreading northward and north-eastward of El Gutha, or Syria of Damascus; to the westward of which was the little kingdom of Aram Maachah, stretching north-eastward along the slopes of Anti-Lebanon. Some distance farther in Emessa, or the latter direction is ancient Emessa, now Hums, situated in Hums ■ a vast plain of great fertility, at the distance of less than a mile from the right bank of the O routes, and probably containing upwards of 25,000 inhabitants. The walls have a circum ference of nearly three miles, including the ruins of the castle, which occupies a conical mound towards the southern extremity of the city; the latter, on the whole, has an imposing appear ance, being surrounded with vast cemeteries looking like ex tensive suburbs. Town and North-westward of Hums was the ancient kingdom of plain of Ha- w itliin its limits are the towns of Jisr Shugher, also Seleuco Belus, already mentioned (page 411), Famieh (Apamea) on the opposite side, with fine pasture around; and the capital itself, all in the valley of the Orontes. Hamath, the ancient Epiphania, is situated in the centre of a fine plain on both sides of the river Orontes, which is here crossed by four bridges. There are several mosques, many good houses, showing, however, a mean exterior, and nearly 35,000 in habitants. Water is raised by means of hydraulic wheels with earthen buckets, similar to those in use along the Euphrates. The plain just mentioned extends westward from the Orontes to the wilderness of Tadmor. The western part of the latter has a good arable soil, occasionally fertilized by a stream ; and besides the ruins of many villages, it contains some ancient places which are still inhabited; such are Agontufa and Mamouthie, the latter being remarkable for a pretty minareh; also the extensive village of Rahabah, Atania with its salt lake, the cluster of hamlets called Jerood; and, finally, Kariateen, probably Kir Jathain. 1 This is a walled town of considerable size, and is well built; it occupies both sides of an 1 1 Chron., chap.

Subsequently, the great valley leading eastward becomes more of a desert, frequently having a hard beaten surface, and being elsewhere scantily covered with grass mixed with the camel- thorn (retern), kali, and some other plants. The plain, which varies in width from 10 to 18 miles, is bounded on each side by a chain of hills running W.S.W. and E.N.E.; that on the north-west being considerably higher than the other, and generally it so continues for about 50 miles, when both of them meet a double range of steep serrated hills, forming another wide valley which terminates at Deir, and may be considered as separating Syria from Arabia. At the point of junction, a pass about 1£ miles in length, traverses the north-western chain, and connects the two Wadis. At the eastern extremity of this singular gorge is the necropolis, which is overlooked by a bold Saracenic castle on the summit of the ridge; and in the plain to the eastward of the latter, at a spot about midway between Tyre and Babylon, are the remains of a city no less remarkable for its commercial importance than its antiquity, having been founded by Solomon, 1 who, according to Josephus, 2 built this city, encompassed it with very strong walls, and gave it the name of Tadmor. Palmyra does not consist of a mere heap of mounds, like the Appearance of ruins of Akkad, Babylon, Chalne, Nineveh, Sus, and Troy, Palinyra - with some of which it was no doubt contemporary ; for having been reconstructed with durable materials, the principal buildings yet remain to attest its ancient grandeur. The city of Palms has not, however, the striking boldness of Baalbek, nor the unique character of Persepolis; nor is its general aspect equal to the coup-d'ceil of Jerash from the great temple ; yet from its situation, touching a wide-spreading wilderness on the one side, and a mountain range rising like a huge wall abruptly from the plain on the other, it produces, in some respects, an effect beyond that of the cities just mentioned. It displays ruined colonnades, temples, and arches, extending about 1 He built Tadmor in the Wilderness, 2 Chron., chap. VHI., v. 4. Ba'aldth and Tadmor in the Wilderness, 1 Kings, chap.

XX. a mile and a half westward of the temple of the Sun, with a wilderness of columns in every state, from the most finished specimens of art to that of complete destruction. A closer ex amination is not, however, free from disappointment, in conse quence of the mixed nature of the architecture, and the columns being of different ages and various sizes. The castle, once no doubt the acropolis, occupies a pro minent situation near the S. S.-eastern extremity of the ruins, where its massive walls rise to about 100 feet in the form of a parallelogram 600 yards long by 400 yards wide. It is sur rounded by a ditch ; and the entrance, over which there is an inscription, is through a double gateway on the south side ; the interior contains a spacious quadrangle constructed with im- The great mense blocks of stone, within which was the celebrated temple temple. dedicated to the tutelary deity of Syria. The present entrance is through a low door in a miller's hut, and this being passed, the interior presents a square enclosure of 679 feet each way, with two rows of columns all round the inside. The temple itself is 124 feet long by 47 feet wide; it is in a good style of architecture, having a peristyle of 140 columns, and the remains of enclosures forming suites of apartments, which, as Heeren justly remarks, are similar to those of a splendid khan, suited for the accommodation of the brother merchants of ancient Tyre, at this stage of their journeyings to and from Babylon. The entrance gate nearly faced the setting sun, and its soffit presents a zodiac similar to ours. 1 About 200 yards W.S.W. of this building, there is a richly- ornamented archway and 12 Corinthian columns, in the best style; and some little distance onward, at the intersection of a cross street, are four very large pedestals, on each of which there probably was a statue. Parallel to this, on the southern Colonnade. side, are the remains of an extensive colonnade, also a large cistern; from which, at about 30 feet below the surface, a conduit appears to have conveyed water to the temple and acropolis. Amongst the masses of ruins prolonged towards the N.W. may be distinguished numerous columns of smaller 1 Volney's Travels, vol. II., p. 276.CHAP. XX.] PALMYRA. 625 size, many of them still erect, and marking the lines of the Colonnades, cross streets. The Corinthian columns belonging to the grand colonnade, especially those near the archway, are of fine pro portions and large size ; and on many of them there are Greek inscriptions ; there are also some in Latin, and one in Hebrew. 1 These monuments appear to relate almost exclusively to com mercial prosperity, being public acknowledgments of the bene fits bestowed by Aurelian and others on the merchants and city of Palmyra. 2 In other places are the remains of small colonnades of inferior architecture; whilst dilapidated masses of ruins extending along the southern side of the great avenue, almost to the foot of the mountain, display architraves, friezes, pediments, &amp;c., belonging to a later and less interesting period of the arts. The sepulchral towers of the necropolis are not the least The necropolis, remarkable remains of Tadmor, of which they may be con sidered as forming the western extremity. As already noticed; these singular tenements of the dead occupy the gorge, and indeed part of the slope of the hill below the Saracenic castle; some are tolerably perfect, but the greater part are quite in ruins. The towers are square, with two, three, and sometimes even four stories. In the centre of each was a space about 30 feet long by 10 feet wide, with some busts in basso-relievo at the farther end of the chamber; and sometimes on the ceiling are half-length heathen deities painted on a blue ground. From the floor to the ceiling on both sides are a number of recesses divided by shelves into compartments more than 6 feet long by 2 feet wide, but rather less in depth, so as to give the requisite space in each for a mummy ; 3 and when tenanted, the aperture was closed by means of a stone or marble door. These towers generally have flat roofs, but in some few Sepulchral instances they terminate with a stone pyramid. The build- lowers - ings are of red sandstone; apertures like windows light each 1 Found in a small building adjoining the avenue.—Irby and Mangles' Travels, p. 273. 2 Heeren's Researches in Asia, pp. 440, 442, 446. 8 Mummies and mummy-cloths were likewise in use in the dependant city, Zelebi, the city of Zenohid, see p. 418.526 PALMYRA.

Among these sepulchres Aqueduct. passes the principal aqueduct by which water was conveyed about three miles to the city from the grotto called Ephea; and near the spring, which is tepid, there was an altar de dicated to Jupiter. Another spring, which is also tepid and sulphureous, bursts at once from the earth near the ex tremity of the ruins with a considerable volume of water; after passing through the conduit it unites with the preceding stream in the melon ground, near the date groves, eastward of the ruins. Further on, in the latter direction, the surface of the country is covered with saline particles; and nearly six miles S.E. by E. of the city there is a lake which produces salt in such abundance as to give lucrative occupation to more than 500 Arab families who at present occupy the ruins. There are two other places in this part of the country of some Arach and importance, viz., Arach and Soghne. The former, which is also called 'Irac, is described by the Arabs as being a consider able place : it is situated at the foot of the hills, about 18 miles north-eastward of Palmyra; and the latter, which is also large, about 14 miles farther. Ancient im- The restoration, by the Arabs, of the earliest name, together Palmyra. 0 with the peculiarity of the position and other circumstances, sufficiently prove that the ruins of Tadmor occupy the site so advantageously selected as a commercial emporium, in which the merchants of Phoenicia and Asia Minor could meet and traffic with those of Babylon and Nineveh. It appears to have continued so exclusively commercial as to obtain the name of the city of merchants ; and, being neutral, its friend ship was equally courted by the contending Parthians and Romans, who were at the same time supplied from and through Palmyra with all those luxuries which, in the time of Pliny, 1 absorbed the wealth of the latter people. In the time of Adrian, Palmyra was at the height of its glory, and the principal temples were probably constructed about that period. It continued to be a free and prosperous Roman city 1 Lib. V., cap. xxv.CHAP. XX.] DAMASCUS. 527 till Odenathus, and afterwards his widow, Zenobia, as Empress Fail of Pai- of the East, attempted to throw off the Roman yoke: the lattery- being signally defeated near Hums, the capital was desolated by Aurelian, and its commercial prosperity was at an end. In the sixth century Justinian fortified Palmyra, probably the western part, as an advanced post against the Persians ; and in 634 it was taken, and the ancient name restored by the Khaliph Abu Bekr, whose death took place soon after he had accomplished his grand object of mastering the capital of Syria. Both as regards ancient and modern times, Damascus, the City of Da- place now about to be noticed, claims even a higher interest mascu8: than Palmyra itself, being one of the oldest cities in the world, and perhaps the only one which has continued to flourish from its very foundation. This city, to which are applied the epithets Eden of the its situation Muslim, one of the Gates of the Kaaba, and the Eye of the arid envi,0 ' , • East, occupies the centre of a tract of productive fields and luxuriant garden ground. Like a pearl in the desert, it is situated near the eastern slopes of the Anti-Lebanon, and its territory forms the principal part of the territory of El Gutha, a district containing about 80 villages, which probably represents the ancient and limited kingdom of Aram or Syria of Damascus. With the exception of the suburb of Salahiyah, a mile and a half to the north-west,, the City of Praise, and the City of Joy, 1 as it has been designated, occupies level ground; and the view from the suburb, as well as that from the opening of the hills beyond, is strikingly beautiful. The mass of the town forms a triangle, one side of which extends nearly three miles N.W. by W. from Salahiyah; and another almost an equal distance N.E, by N.: it is surrounded by the remains of its ancient walls, and within is a castellated citadel, besides the usual proportion of khans, baths, serais, sparkling cupolas, and tapering minarehs ; it is embosomed in flower and fruit gardens, dotted here and there with numerous kiosks shaded with trees; the whole forming a wooded belt at least 30 miles 1 Jer., chap. XLIX., v. 25.528 DAMASCUS. [CHAP. XX. in circumference, which terminates on one side in an almost boundless wilderness. The interior of the city is not unlike, but on the whole it is rather superior to its younger sister. Grand Cairo, and its character is more peculiarly oriental ; perhaps more strikingly so throughout than even Baghdad Or Ispahan. The Khan Towards the centre of the town, situated in the middle of a fine covered bazar, is Khan Assad, the masonry of which con sists of black and white marble in alternate courses ; and with respect both to the plan and elevation, this is one of the most imposing structures of the kind in the East. A finely-executed Saracenic gateway leads into a large paved court, having a handsome marble fountain in the centre, and about it' an arcade with pointed arches and rich Saracenic mouldings. Under the arcade are placed the heaps of merchandise; and above it there is a spacious corridor, adjoining which are sun dry apartments used as counting-houses by the principal merchants ; instead of the ordinary flat terrace, these are covered by low elliptical domes. The scene below is one of great interest, being peculiarly characteristic of the country; for in its ordinary state the great court presents crowds of noisy Arabs, scrambling as if between life and death about their laden camels; some preparing to start, others arriving, and a few keeping their animals recumbent till the bales can either be received into the magazine, or placed in some part of the surrounding bazar. The bazar. The latter, being as usual laid out in streets separately ap propriated to various trades as well as to different kinds of merchandise, presents another busy and animating scene. Christians and Jews are seen moving from place to place with a speed which indicates that gain is the object, amongst laden camels, mules, and asses ; besides these, there is a mixed crowd of idlers such as no other city can present; and among the loungers, the Bedawin, with his flowing dress and long spear tipped with black ostrich feathers, occupies the most prominent place. The Druses of the Haouran, with their peculiar close-fitting turbans, their ample cloaks, alternately striped black and white, and long matchlock guns slung atCHAP. XX.] DAMASCUS. 529 their backs have the next place ; the ordinary portions of the crowd being made up of Christians of various denominations. Damascus is celebrated for its numerous coffee-houses and shops of confectioners and bakers, besides its abundant sup plies of meat, rice, vegetables, and fruits for the ordinary wants of the inhabitants. There are about 400 public cook- shops, in which ready-made dishes are prepared for sale. The city is still remarkable for its silk manufactories, and for Manufactures its jewellers, silversmiths, white and copper smiths ; also for of Damascus - its carpenters, trunk, and tent makers; but perhaps the various articles of leather are the most prominent manufac tures. These are boots, shoes, slippers, saddles covered with velvet, and bridles highly ornamented with cowrie shells, besides the trappings of camels and the commoner equip ments of a caravan, such as tents, strong net bags, water- skins, &amp;c.; indeed, no where else in the East can caravan preparations be made with the same advantage and speed, There are, in the city, eight synagogues, one Latin and three Franciscan convents, in addition to four churches, and some churches and others now converted into mosques. Of the latter, there are mosques ' about 200, the finest of which was once a cathedral dedicated to St, John of Damascus; it occupies the site of a Corinthian temple, some of whose columns (of granite) still remain. Besides the body of the Christian structure, 1 with its fine dome, there are two courts; the smaller having on three sides a portico of granite columns, and the largest, which is paved with marble, has a cistern in the centre, with a double row of columns supporting light arches, about it. Another mosque at the north-eastern corner of the city is supposed to contain some remains of a temple to Serapis ; but with these exceptions the rest of the structures are Turkish; and many of them were intended as mausolea for different khaliphs. In addition to the principal divisions occupied by Chris tians, Jews, and Turks, the city, like Cairo, has many sub- 1 The metropolitan church dedicated to St, John the Baptist was built by the Christians and became a mosque in the time of the khaliphs.—Ibn Haukal, Sir W.

Being of sun-dried bricks, the exteriors of the houses of Damascus have a mean appearance ; but on entering through a low and narrow door, the interior is found to be generally handsome. The ordinary dwellings are of small size, and nearly alike, having almost invariably a court surrounded by slightly raised arcades, with the harim and other inner apart ments adjoining them ; there are also one or two small rooms opening on a terrace above. The houses of the richer inhabi tants, whether Hebrew, Christian, or Muslim, generally have two large courts, with a fountain shaded by trees in each, and apartments around. The rooms belonging to the inner court are allotted for the harim, kitchens, &amp;c. The outer and larger court, in addition to a terrace with some small rooms above, has below, an Arabesque saloon of reception containing a raised diwan richly carpeted, and its walls are either gaily painted, or are covered, as well as the columns and ceiling, with small triangular-shaped mirrors. The buildings of the town itself have terraced roofs, but those in the suburbs are gene rally covered with several small cupolas of a conical shape. Josephus ascribes the foundation of Damascus to Uz, the grandson of Noah ^ but according to the Orientalists, it dates only from the time of Abraham f to whose steward, Eliezer, or Djemshah, it owed its origin and its name ; 3 but according to Josephus, 4 Abraham found the city existing when he came from Mesopotamia, and reigned there for a time. After the time of Hadadezer, 5 it became the capital of an independent kingdom under Rezin ; 6 it was also that of Seleucus Nicanor; and during the time of the Greek Emperors of Constantinople it was celebrated for its wealth, luxury, and magnificence. 1 Jos., Ant., lib.

Except the ancient walls Ancient of the city, the Saracenic castle, the site of two temples, and remai,ls ' some excavations at Salakiyah, there are few remains. The street called Strait is still shown between the castle and the western side of the town; also the houses of Naaman and Ananias and that from which St. Paul escaped. [Scene of St. Paul's descent in a basket.] There cannot be much doubt that Abanah and Pharpar 1 are represented by the two branches into which the Barrada divides itself; on the banks of this river are the kiosks and coffee-houses, so much the delight of the people of the city. Independently of the numerous pilgrims passing from Persia, Population. Turkey, Mesopotamia, and India, the population of Damascus, with the addition of Bedawins and Druses may at times amount to 200,000 souls, of whom the permanent residents have been variously estimated at from 120,000 to 150,000 souls. The former of these is probably about the true number, including nearly 5000 Jews, and about 11,000 Armenians and Greeks. The remainder are Turks of what may be considered as the old school, who retain the flowing garments and projecting turbans of their fathers; and have the credit of entertaining a 1 2 Kings, chap.

Temperature. Being 2237 feet above the level of the sea, a bracing cold ness commences in November, and the climate of Damascus is far from being so mild as has been supposed. Even in summer time, the heat is lessened by the quantity of vegetation, as well as by breezes from the Desert on one side and the Lebanon on the other. Owing to the first of these causes, however, intermittent fevers prevail in the autumn ; yet, on the whole, Damascus must be considered a healthy city, and in it aged people are very numerous.( 533 ) CHAPTER XXI. climate, productions, people, and social state OF SYRIA.

Owing to its mountains, Syria, which is generally considered three kinds of to be a warm country, has, on the contrary, especially in the tem P erature - central parts, almost every variety of temperature, sometimes within the short space of one day's journey; and the climate is in consequence very trying to the European constitution. In those tracts which are most peopled there are three kinds of temperature, viz., the cold, the warm and humid, and the warm and dry. The first belongs to the country between the higher slopes climate of the of the Lebanon range and the mountains on whose summits '°™ taino ' s lies perpetual snow : throughout this tract a sharp winter, like that of the north of Germany, is experienced from the end of October to April, when a comparatively mild spring succeeds; this is followed almost immediately by the powerful heat of summer, and by the rapid growth of the vine, the white mul berry, the olive-tree, the cotton-plant, &amp;c. The second embraces the slopes adjoining the coast of the climate of the Mediterranean, together with the adjacent plains of Akka, coast ' Tripoli, Baalbek, Antioch, Beirut, and Tyre ; also those in the interior, such as Esdraelon, part of Persea, the western side of Damascus, the valley of the Jordan, &amp;c., in which534 climates of syria. [chap. xxi. tracts the winters are so mild that oranges, bananas, &amp;c., flourish in the open air. The summer, however, brings with it a clammy and oppressive, although fertilizing heat, and the winter and summer have each a rainy season. The first con tinues at intervals from November to January, and the second, setting in at the beginning of April, speedily fills the grain. Climate of the A comparatively mild winter prevails, with some rain, and parts,' eaStern occasional intervals of frost and snow, in the third climate, which comprehends the south-eastern parts of Syria; the snow, however, only remains on the ground for a short time. A high degree of temperature, accompanied by dry parching winds, belongs to the summer in this zone. The winds here alluded to come from the bordering desert, and sweep over the tracts stretching southward, as well as the pasture grounds northward and eastward of the capital; and their effect is in creased in consequence of these tracts being screened from the humid winds which prevail between the coast and the western slopes of Lebanon, insalubrity of The latter portions, and indeed many other parts of the the coast. Syrian territory, are insalubrious, as is shown by the number of deaths in the principal towns; for Yafa, Akka, Sai'de, Tri poli, Ladikiyeh, Tortosa, Beirut, and even Damascus, suffer at certain times from fever ; and to this may be added the ravages of the small-pox. The rest of the territory, particularly the plains towards, and bordering upon the desert, may be consi dered healthy, although the mortality is considerable, especially during the visitations of the plague, which, from patients being abandoned by their friends (through fear of contagion rather than from the violence of the disease itself), sweeps away thousands. Not even in the west does the patient who is attacked get any thing like a fair chance of recovery, being wholly or partly deserted; though, as will be noticed in an other part of this work, 1 the disease seems to be only a form of typhus fever. In the districts of Tripoli, Akka, and Damascus, three descriptions of soil prevail. In general that of the moun- In the Personal Narrative.CHAP.

The natural harshness of the soil is overcome by industry, and the slopes and terraces are rendered sufficiently fertile, while the lower parts of the country are naturally productive. The second and richest district are the plains of Esdraelon, Soil of the Zabulon, Ba'albek, part of the Decapolis, and Damascus, as Deca P ol,s » &amp;c - well as the valleys of the Jordan and Orontes, which for the most part consist of a fat, loamy soil, like that of Umk, and the other tracts already noticed in northern Syria. Being almost without a pebble, it becomes, when dry, a fine brown earth, like garden mould, which, when saturated by the rains, is almost a quagmire, and in the early part of summer becomes a marsh: when cultivated, most abundant crops of the finest tobacco, cotton, and grain are obtained. The remainder of the territory chiefly consists of thesoiiofthe plains called Barr by the Arabs, and Midbar by the Hebrews, s^rfaT parts of each word signifying simply a tract of land left entirely to nature, and being applied to the pasture tracts about almost every town in Syria, as well as to those spots where vege tation almost entirely fails. Such spots prevail in the tracts towards the eastern side of the country, where the soil is mostly an indurated clay with irregular ridges of limestone hills separating different parts of the surface. The better description of soil is occasionally diversified by hill and dale, and has very much the appearance of some of our downs, but is covered with the liquorice plant, mixed with aromatic shrubs, and occasionally some dwarf trees, such as the tamarisk and acacia. Many of the tracts eastward of the Jordan are of this description, particularly those near the Haouran, which, under the name of Roman Arabia, had Bozra for its capital. The inferior tracts are frequently coated with pebbles and black flints, having little and sometimes no vegetation; their cheerless and monotonous aspect being relieved at intervals536 MINERALS AND ANIMALS.

Minerals of Mineral productions, as far as they are at present known, appear to be but few. Iron is abundant in the Kesruan, and coal is worked near Beirut; silver, quicksilver, bitumen, and iron have been found in the Anti-Lebanon, 1 and near Hasi- biyah ; and, as in the time of Tacitus, 2 bitumen is collected at the Dead Sea; rock salt is also found in the same neighbour hood. As yet, however, there is not any appearance of either copper, tin, lead, or gold, in the country; although from these metals being mentioned in the Hebrew writings, 3 it is probable that they will eventually be found, wild and As in northern Syria, jackals, foxes, hyaenas, and wild boars are numerous; and there are leopards, 4 porcupines, and some bears.

But the wild goat, the bouquetin of the Alps, appears in the Haouran and other parts, tame animals. Camels and horses are numerous, chiefly of the Arabian breeds; but of the former, the heavier and more enduring animals produced by a mixture with the race of Turcomania, are wanting; the asses and mules, especially the former, are, however, greatly superior to those in other parts of Asia. The heavy-tailed sheep and goats with long hair and pendant ears are the ordinary animals of these classes.

Besides the trees already enumerated in the 18th chapter, there are many others—as the cedar, the butm, or wild pistachio, 3 the nopal, a kind of broom of large size, the kharub, or locust-tree, 4 the date, the defle, 5 the orange, the lemon, the fig, and the Fmits pomegranate. Almonds and other common fruits, as grapes and olives, are more flourishing in the central and southern than in the northern parts of Syria. The sweet-honied reed—the well known sugar-cane—is still grown where the Crusaders found it in the eleventh century. 6 Indigo is cultivated on the shores of the Dead Sea, and in some places along the Jordan ; and cochineal has recently been introduced about Tripoli. At the latter place, and around Beirut as well as Damascus, and in the intervening districts of the Lebanon, silk is produced, but with a proportion of hemp, tobacco, and occasionally in some few places a little cotton.

The grain harvest, which is the principal one, takes place at the end of May or early in June ; later, the hummus, a kind of vetch, comes in with other crops, but on a small scale; for apathy, the besetting sin of the Turk, causes the quantity, particularly of grain, to be regulated by the actual Understood to be the Tetrao A1 Katta. 6 Mill's Hist, of the Crusades, vol.

The imports are French and German cloths, cutlery, coffee, long-cloths, twist, rice, salt, indigo, cochineal, copperas, tin, pepper, pimento, and yarn; and from the Persian Gulf, pearls, muslins, with other kinds of Indian and Persian goods; and the value of the whole being greater than that of the exports, the difference is made up by cash payments. impediments There are besides, many other disadvantages to which the to commerce. . . 1 ^. | r. , , country is subject, such as the want 01 good harbours and carriage-roads into the interior, the deficiency of capital, and the absence of that confidence which often supplies its place; also the high rate of interest (from 12 to 30 per cent.) on borrowed money ; and, above all, the improvident habits of the various branches composing the people of Syria; from the Turk, who contents himself with what he has, to the lawless Bedawin who levies an enormous tax on the merchandise as it passes the desert. But as trade flourished at one period notwithstanding the impediments which have always existed, it would do so again; and with two such emporiums as Aleppo to the north, and Damascus, touching the desert, to the south, the country would soon change a state bordering upon poverty for one of comparative richness. The latter city, besides its intercourse with Europe through A sweetmeat called dibbes, which is made from grapes, and supplies the place of sugar, is an article of export to Turkey.CHAP.

Besides a fair portion of shopkeepers who retail woollen and other goods, there are about 90 Muhammedan commercial establishments, 30 kept by native Christians and 24 by Hebrews; also two British houses and one French house. There is, for the settlement of disputes, a tribunal of commerce, whose members are of different nations and religions, and nearly in proportion to the number of merchants belonging to each. We find that, from the most remote period, the narrow Ancient in- strip stretching from Akka northward to Tortosa, between pSeS. of the Lebanon mountains on one side, and the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on the other, was occupied by the Phoeni cians, who had previously dwelt on the Erythrean Sea, 1 which name was then probably applied to the Persian Gulf; The interior, as far as the valley of the Jordan, was occupied by the Jebusites, Hittites, and other descendants of Canaan; the tract lying along the coast, to the southward, contained the five satrapies of the Philistines, viz., Gath, Ekron, Ashdod, Askulan, and Gaza; whilst the countries beyond the Jordan were in possession of the Susim, Emim, Anakites, and other Cushite branches. The whole of the preceding territory was, in the first instance, known by the name of Chna, or the land 2 of Canaan ; then by that of Philistia, or Palestine : 3 it extended to the frontiers of Egypt, and included three provinces west of the Jordan, viz., Judsea, Galilee, and Samaria, with two beyond, Persea, and Trachonitis. Subsequently, this terri tory became known as the land of Israel, or the Holy Land; which extended from Sihor, 4 on the brook or torrent of Egypt, 5 1 Herod., lib. I., c. ii., and lib. VII., c.

The more northern, and probably the earliest of these, was Aram Zobah, 4 which touched Aram Naharaim, or Mesopo tamia, and possibly is the Hobah of Genesis, 5 being on the left hand, or north of Damascus. That part of the adjoining valley of the Orontes which lies to the north-west of Zobah appears to have constituted the ancient kingdom of Hamath, of which Riblah, on the east side of Ain 6 (the fountain), after wards Hamath the Great (see above, page 424), or Epiphania, was the capital: this kingdom, in the time of Solomon, was part of Zobah, being called Hamath Zobah ; 7 and, subse quently, it contained the Roman districts of Cyrrhestica, Chalcitis, Chalybonitis, and Epiphania, with part of Palmy- rena. The little but important kingdom called Syria of Da mascus, was formed by some bands under Rezon, the son of Eliadad, who, having fled from king Hadadezer, reigned in Damascus, 8 and was succeeded by a long line of kings, who made war alternately on Israel and Judah. Westward of the kingdom of Damascus was that of Aram Maacah, 9 also called Maachati, 10 and Abel-Beth-Maachah, 15 a 1 Dr. Zunz on the Hebrew Geography of Palestine.—Benjamin of Tudela, by A.

On the western slope of this part of the Lebanon was Syria Syria of Rehob. of Rehob, or Rohob, 1 afterwards Geshur, 2 a small kingdom in the interior of Phoenice, which appears to have been older than those of Damascus and Aram Maachah. Finally, Syria of Tob, 3 or Ish Tob, which fell to the half tribe of Manasseh, was situated at the north-eastern extremity of the same terri tory. As the subject will be noticed more at length in another Ancient inha- place, it may here be observed merely, that the early inha- of bitants of Aram were derived from two branches of the line of Ham, viz., the Phoenicians and Canaanites; and from the descendants of Abraham, who was of the line of Shem: these last found the language of the former settlers in use towards the east, while the Philistines (see above, pp. 83, 84) spoke the Syriac, or Aramaic, a dialect of the Aramean, which has a written character of great antiquity. After the invasion of Tiglath Pileser, the worship of Ancient reii- Rimmon, 4 and of Adad, or Benhadad, appears to have been gl0n of Syria ' replaced by that of Astarte; to whom magnificent temples were raised, particularly at Hierapolis. 5 Besides the temples to the Queen of Heaven, or Queen of the Stars, there appear to have been many deities whose names were derived from the Chal dean Bel, in connection with the sun; such as Ba'al at Sidon, Ba'al Berith, Ba'al Semen, See.: and there were likewise temples dedicated to Thalissius, or the sea, to Hercules, Adonis, Osiris, and other deified men. The invention of letters has been attributed to the Phoe nicians, 6 and, in very early times, arithmetic, astronomy, and philosophy, were cultivated in the country, which was then the emporium of commerce, and celebrated for arts; more par ticularly the manufacture of glass, and the Tyrian dye. 7 1 Num. chap.

A remnant of the inhabitants who succeeded the Phoe nicians and Canaanites may, it is supposed, still be traced about Nabulus, and likewise amongst the Ansarians and Ismail ians: the first, no doubt, are the descendants of the people brought thither from Assyria by Shalmanasar and Nebuchadnezzar ; and these are now divided into several reli gious sects, of which the three principal are the Dositheans, the Lebadeans, and the Gorthem : the two other branches alluded to appear to have come from later stocks. The Ansarians, also called Nosain, are, according to Mannert, descended from a people who, under the name of the Nazareni, had their own prince as late as the time of the Romans; and are still powerful, being able to arm 12 or 15,000 men ; they are occa sionally mixed with a few Arabs, Kurds, and Turkomans, and occupy both slopes of the great Nosairian range, from Kal'at- el-Hosn northwards to the southern part of the district of Tenets of the Aleppo. The Ansaries consider Adam, Christ, and Mu- nsanes. hammed, simply as prophets; but they regard Abel, Peter, and especially All, as personifications of the Divinity. Many of them believe in the metempsychosis ; but there are different sects, such as the Shenisea, the Kelbia, and the Mokledjye ; l the first of which, as worshippers of the sun, are connected with the idolatry of Babylonia. Their tenets are, however, involved in mystery, and are likely so to continue ; for in conversation they practise the same system of deception which is, in part, the safeguard of the Druses; by whom they are claimed as an apostate branch. 2 It is laid down that nothing concerning their religion is to be disclosed to strangers ; that they must love their brethren, be charitable, refrain from theft and swearing, and patiently endure poverty and ill treatment from their wives. The ismaiii. The other branch, the Ismaili, or Assassins, are less nume rous, and their tenets no less mysterious.

The Ismaili are reported to adore the pudendum, and, on certain days, to mix in promiscuous debauchery; but whatever in reality may be the nature of their rites, their faith is so carefully concealed, that even the contents of their religious books are only known by those who are fully initiated. 3 It is not improbable that the territory at the south-western Descendants extremity of the Pashalik of Aleppo contains a tribe of sy r tns earlie8t Syrians, who are the descendants of the earliest people of the country: they occupy the ravines on the northern slopes of Jebel-el-Akrab, and Anti-Casius, as well as some of those on Mount Rhosus and the Amanus; and they live in small secluded villages. Their houses usually have sloping roofs, covered with tiles; and the better kind contain two small rooms for the family, with others for the animals; but in general there is only a single apartment, one end of which is appropriated to the animals, and the other to the family; a kind of separation being formed by a row of high conical earthen vessels, called kowari, which contain grain, flour, &amp;c.

Indeed, before the arrival of the Egyptian Pasha, the existence of this branch of the Syrian people scarcely seems to have been known.

As the communications appear to have been constant, and the warlike inroads from Assyria frequent, the population along the line of the great route towards Southern Syria was subject to repeated and sweeping changes, while the recesses of the mountains west ward of this line continued long undisturbed. No road traversed this part of the territory; and whilst Epiphania, or Hamath the Great, and other places more eastward, communicated with Assyria, Tadmor, Damascus, &amp;c., the inhabitants of the deep valleys on the slopes of Mount Casius and the Amanus were, in all probability, excluded from any intercourse with their neighbours; hence they have continued almost intact, notwithstanding the various changes caused by the wars of the Arabians, Turks, and Christians, as well as the influx of the Kurds, Turkomans, and other people. The other parts of Syria having been invaded by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Saracens, Crusaders, and Turks, the inha bitants consist of many different races, who still preserve their particular habits and manners.CHAP. XXI.] GIPSIES AND ARABS. 545 On the plain of Esdraelon, and some other tracts towards the south-eastern side of the territory, Arabs are frequently seen with their tents and flocks, and occasionally are perceived the wicker booths of the Turkomans; but on the slopes of Lebanon and those of the Nosarian range, the tents of the Arabs are fewer, and the Turkoman booths more numerous; both, however, are mixed with Kurd villages, and occasionally with the more portable habitations of the Gipsies, here called Gipsies of No wars : these are the Xebeques and Zingani of Asia Minor, Syria ■ and the Kurpadh of Aleppo (see above, pages 375 and 436), whose manners and customs, scanty dresses and temporary dwellings, seem to carry us back to that primitive state of the world in which permanent buildings were unknown. The country round the Dead Sea, as well as the tracts The Mousta- northward, along both sides of the Jordan, are occupied by the rabe - Moustarabe, who, as will elsewhere be shown, are descended from the ancient Arabs, mixed with the children of Lot and the different branches from Abraham ; l and also with some of the still earlier inhabitants of the land, as the Emim, &amp;c. But the dispersion of the descendants of Isaac had in fact com menced in the time of Shalmanasar, and it continued to increase during the reigns of the Ptolemies and the first Roman emperors, when the people occupied the different parts of the world, to which the destruction of Jerusalem is generally supposed to have driven them. A remnant of the Hebrews is still to be found in the cities Hebrews. ofTabariyah, Safet, Nabulus, Hebron, Damascus and Aleppo, as well as in every large town, and occasionally also in the villages of Judea and the Decapolis, but especially in Jerusalem, near the site of the beloved temple. 8 Few of them are now shepherds or cultivators, merchandise and different kinds of trades being their principal occupations; and they receive from the government that secondary kind of protection which the Muslim is wont to bestow (see pages 253, 377) on those who 1 The descendants of Isaac, Ismael, and the sons of Ketnrah.—Gen., chaps.

The Mitauiis occupy a portion of the northern part of the district of Akka, but they are principally found in that of Tripoli and on the slopes of Lebanon near Ba albek, also towards the western extremity of the Pashalik of Damascus. In the 17th century, however, their territory was more extensive, not only in the interior, but also on the coast, where it included the ports of Sur and Jube'il. They are presumed to be a branch of the ancient Syrians, who in later times embraced the doctrines of Ali: to these they adhere so rigidly that an earthern vessel out of which a Christian may have drank is forthwith broken ; and even their own clothes, if touched, are considered unclean. In other particulars, also, they resemble the Shiahs of Persia, andCHAP.

A short carbine is the ZmS* principal weapon carried in these excursions, which are made on horseback; and cruelty is apt to be added to robbery when an ^ unfortunate traveller happens to fall within their grasp. Baalbek is almost their only town; but, being an agricultural people, their villages are numerous. The houses are of clay, and frequently have a kind of portico, but they are flat-roofed', and seldom contain more than a single apartment; one end of which is occupied by the family, the floor being sometimes raised, and the other by the animals; a row of high conical baskets of grain being the only separation. A house is set apart for strangers, that the dwellings and utensils of the people may not be contaminated. A patriarchal chief regulates the ordinary concerns of the village under a principal chief, an Emir of the Harfuth family. As a body, the brave and warlike Mitaulis are able and willing to resist the weak governments of the Pashas, when the demands made in the name of the Sultan are pronounced to be unreasonable. The Christians consist of a limited number of Armenians, Sects of whose patriarch resides in the convent of Bezommar, and Christian8 ' Greek Catholics, whose principal seat is at Mar-Hann-Shouar, where there is a printing press, a library, &amp;c.; there are also some Syrian Greeks, or Melchites, who have a ritual in Arabic; a few Jacobites, and the Maronites. The last, who are the most numerous, chiefly occupy, as we have already seen, the mountainous district of the Kesruan, together with some portions of the adjoining tracts ; they use a mixed dialect of the Arabic and Syriac, and the written character of the last. Occasionally they live in separate houses, but generally in stone hamlets or villages, which, owing to their situations, are usually defensible; each has a chapel and tower, with a bell. Their ritual is in Syriac, and Kanubin is considered to be the ecclesiastical capital. The patriarch has under his jurisdiction 12 bishops, some of The Maronite*. whom are scarcely above want, and upwards of 200 convents. The high walls surrounding these extensive buildings contain kitchens, refectories, dormitories, and the other accompani- 4 A 2548 COUNTRY OF THE DRUSES. [CHAP. XXI.

The Maronite districts form two small and almost independent republics; each being under an Emir belonging to one of the principal families of the adjoining territory, over which, as a body, the Maronites exercise considerable influence.

Throughout this tract a kind of republican independence is maintained under the Sheikh Beshir, a hereditary chieftain, who resides at Shouf. But, by way of control, a Muhammedan, now the Emir Beshir, is appointed by the Porte, whose system of government consists in maintaining a sort of balance between the Christians, to whom he is supposed secretly to belong, and the Druses. His authority extends from Belad Akkar to the district of Akka, but his revenue, including the miri collected for himself, does not exceed £10,000, whilst the Sheikh Beshir, with his feudal state and retinue, who 1 The others are El Djessain, the Kesruan, El M&amp;tin, El Soleima, El Gharb, El Eokany, El Tahtany, El Djord, El Shehhar, El Menaszef, El Aaarkouh, and El Kharroub .—Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, pp. 204, 205.CHAP.

A fire-place in the centre, a raised diwan at one side, and several cupboards recessed in the walls, constitute the furniture of the interior; but a terraced roof, shaded by mulberry and pomegranate trees, serves as a second room, and is the sleeping place in summer, as well as the chief resort of the family ; passengers also occupy it occasionally, for as the roof of one house is the ordinary passage to that of a higher building, the terraces are common to all persons, but a stranger must not enter the dwelling itself; the Druses are, however, disposed to live in harmony with Christians, though they do not intermarry. Arabic is the language spoken. Their character. Patient industry, in which the females largely share, deter mined valour, extreme pride of birth, hospitality, extending to the unflinching protection of strangers, deadly feuds among themselves, an absence of respect for the ties of blood, the dread of a public insult, and exceeding love of their romantic country, are some of the leading characteristics of these mountaineers. Those of Shohba and the Haouran are less marked in point of character, having become more assimilated to their neighbours of other creeds. Religion. Their religious rites are but little known, but they have a priesthood, of which the first class is the Akkal, or initiated, who have charge of the schools, and perform certain unknown ceremonies every Thursday in their closed and guarded oratories, the women being part of the assemblage. Islamism was introduced among them by Hakim, Khaliph of Egypt, in 1030; when in public they perform its rites, but in private it is otherwise, and they are said to abhor all religions except their own. 1 In order to conceal their religious opinions the more effectually, they always, on being questioned concerning them, profess to be of the same faith as the inquirer, whether he be Christian, or Muslim, or Pagan. 2 They keep a register of births, and cannot disinherit their children; they do not 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 201. 8 Benjamin of Tudela says they are heathens and unbelievers, who confess no religion.—By A.

Indeed, a belief prevails, and on fair grounds, that the religious rites of the Druses resemble those of the ancient Samaritans. The remaining sections of the Syrian people, viz., Kurds, Dwellings of Turkomans, and Turks, were probably connected with one theKurd8 ' another at a period not very remote. Some villages belonging to the first are found on the slopes of the northern districts of Lebanon, and now and then a few of the second on the ad joining plains of the Bika; but the chief parts of both branches are in the district of Aleppo. The dwellings of the Kurds appear to hold a middle place between the tent and the better kind of permanent habitation. One large apartment serves for every purpose, a part being fitted as a stable, another ac commodates the cattle, a third serves for the store of pro vender, &amp;c., and the fourth is appropriated to the family. The villages are roughly constructed either with mud or the worst kind of rubble masonry, and the houses in each vary in number from fifteen to about forty; but, during the warm season, tents are substituted for the houses, and are pitched close to the village. Amongst the people who inhabit some of the remote villages Their character in the mountains, may still be found that fierce spirit and the other unfavourable traits of character already given to the Kurds (see above, pp. 125, 374) ; but in general those of Syria, although exceedingly ignorant, have the redeeming points of a peaceable and hospitable disposition. As we have already seen, the majority of the Turkomans are essentially nomadic, and remove from Asia Minor with their flocks during the winter, using either circular booths or small-sized tents; but certain branches of this people, such as the Ryhanlu, the Jerid, and the Rishwans, do not quit the plains of Syria, and they are in other respects more civilized. They use a large black goat's-hair tent, which is supported by several rows of short poles; that of the chief, who still retains552 TURKOMANS AND [CHAP. XXI. the ancient title of Malek or King, is readily distinguished by its superior size; it forms the centre, around which those of the different sections of the tribe are pitched, the tents of each section encircling their immediate chiefs ; and in the case of the Ryhanlu and some of the other Turkomans, the en campment covers an extensive tract of country. Dwellings and The Turkoman tent is clean, and having a division, it con- Turkomarus.^ 16 tains two comfortable apartments. A large fire occupies the centre of the outer apartment, or that of the men, around which is the diwan; and during the intervals between the meals, coffee is frequently handed to the guests in cups about double the size of those used by the Turks and Arabs. Bur- ghtil, rice, eggs, honey, dried fruits, cheese, bread, lebben, and occasionally meat, constitute the ordinary fare of the Turko mans; to which the richer add pilaus, stews, and rebabs. The men have a well-formed athletic frame, with a taste for bright and gaudy colours and showy arms. The women are good looking, but much plainer in their attire than the men ; they do not join the latter during the meals, but they freely enter the men's apartment at other times, and converse with them without covering the face. They are particularly industrious in their household occupations, which include the manufacture of tent cloth of goat's hair, large double bags of the same material, and fine woollen carpets, which on the whole rival those of eastern Persia; the blue, green, and red dyes of the Turkomans being superior to those of Kirman and Yezd.

Ibrahim Pasha, as the best means of encouraging this desirable spirit, intrusted local power to certain chiefs, such as Achmet Bey of Murad Pasha, and Muhammed Bey of Kilis. The former has adopted the modern dress of the Sultan and Pashas, but he continues like his ancestors to dwell in tents, keeping up something like feudal state on the plain of 'Umk ; and the latter is established in the town of Kilis, which he has made the seat of theGHAP.

The principal riches of the Turkomans, however, consist in cattle; but in the spring they carry to Aleppo, Antioch, and other places, carpets, bags. Traffic, and the produce of their fields, also sheep's wool and lamb's wool, butter and cheese; taking back cloth, coffee, sugar, sweetmeats, &amp;c. At other times their chief employment is the transport of merchandise ; and their favourite animal is a low set powerful camel of a cross breed between the double humped or Bactrian and the Arabian camel. The better qualities of the Turkoman do not appear to have suffered in consequence of his having made some approach to civilization; and although he may not get credit for such good qualities, he has carried with him into the plains of Aleppo hospitality and fidelity to his engagements, in addition to a fair share of honesty in his dealings with mankind. The migrations of this people are quite in accordance with Migrations of their pastoral habits: their manner of removing from one theTurkomans - place to another differs from that of other nomadic people in the employment of cows and oxen as beasts of burden, the goods to be conveyed being distributed among them; each animal carries one or two large bags of grain; some have besides, either kitchen utensils, tents, or booths ; poultry, and even cradles with infants, are slung to others. Goats, sheep, &amp;c., form part of the line, and each day's march is in con sequence, as may be supposed, very short. The ordinary language in use is a corrupted dialect of the Turkish. The character of the masters of the country, who are no Character of doubt the principal branch of the preceding stock, differs but ^ Turks ' little from that already given. 1 The Turks of Syria are, however, especially in Akka, Damascus, and Jerusalem, less tolerant, and have more of the haughty spirit of past times than those who live in Europe and Asia Minor; but if the former still continue in some degree intolerant with respect to the so-called infidel, it may, on the other hand, be observed that the traveller who is the guest of a Muslim not only finds himself safe with his host, but is in no danger of being robbed or injured by any other of that creed. 1 See above, p. 376-378. VOL. I. 4 B554 BEDAWiN AND FELAHS. [CHAP. XXI. The limited furniture of a Turkish dwelling has already been described, 1 and the travelling equipments of a Turk are also simple: they consist of a tent of small size, a carpet, a mattress, a coverlet, and a cloak ; whilst the culinary articles are limited to a couple of saucepans, one within the other, a couple of dishes, and as many plates arranged in the same manner, with a round leathern table. His provision is a bag of oil or butter, some salt, pepper, rice, dried raisins, cheese, dates, and a stock of coffee-berries; to which are added a complete appa ratus for making coffee, which, with the cups, are carried in a light case; also a* tinder-box and a pipe, the most indispen sable item of the whole. The last occupies the time whilst coffee is in preparation, during a noon-day halt, and while the pilau is being prepared in the khan or encampment for the night: when enjoying his pipe and his coffee, the Turk seems to have every thing that he desires. Independently of the artisans and the trading inhabitants of the towns, the people of Syria are either nomadic or agri cultural, or such as partake of both denominations; and some of these last are to be found in almost every part of the terri tory. The first are the Bedawins, who move with their flocks from one pasture ground to another; they are under the patriarchal government of a chief, who acknowledges, but scarcely obeys, the authority of the Sultan, as exercised by his Pashas. The third are such as the sedentary Arabs and some few Kurds and Turkomans, who, being partially cultivators, are necessarily subject to the local authorities at one period of the year; but becoming nomadic at another period, they then pay no tribute. The second are the Felahs, who are purely agriculturists; they comprise the bulk of the Christians, Druses, Osmanlis, and other inhabitants, and are amenable to the laws of the country; which, however despotic in theory, are really mild in operation. It is true that the power of the Sultan is dele gated almost unconditionally to the four great Pashas, and again downward from them to the Mutesellim, the Ay an, the Agha, and even the humble Sheikh-el-Belad ; each of whom is 1 See above, pp. 366, 361.CHAP. XXI.] TENURES. 555 considered as open to a bribe, and ready to oppress the people in Administration order to increase his own wealth ; yet the exactions are fairly of iu8tice ' apportioned by persons acquainted with the means possessed by each individual. Moreover, in civil as well as in criminal cases, a salutary check is caused by the publicity of an open investigation, and by the influential effects of the Koran. The Ayans, Mutesellims, and other chiefs adjudicate trifling and even serious matters, whether criminal or civil, subject, how ever, to an appeal which, in some instances, is made to the authority of the Sultan, but ordinarily to the Mekemeh, a court of common law, annually held in the principal towns under a Kadi, sent by the Sheikh-ul-Islam from Constanti nople ; these Kadis appoint deputies to preside in courts held in other towns for the adjudication of causes. The Koran is the recognised guide in all cases of difficulty; but throughout Syria, as elsewhere in Turkey, capital offences are rare, and those of a trifling nature are prevented or punished by the cavasses, who are organized in almost every town for this purpose. The tenure of lands and other property in Syria is well Law of entails, ascertained, and the holdings as well as the transfers are care fully registered. Certain tracts which were not cultivated in the time of Selim still belong to the Sultan, and are annually farmed to the highest bidder. Vakou or entails are common in Syria, and are made by private individuals either to endow mosques, khans, or other public institutions; or, as with us, to confer property on the eldest sons and next heirs. Real property, such as arable land, gardens, vineyards, buildings, &amp;c., goes by inheritance first to the son and grandson, next to the father and grandfather, then to the brother, followed by his son, next to the uncle, followed by the cousin. A husband's claim is allowed after these; and lastly, any indivi dual becomes the heir of the slave on whom he may have bestowed freedom. In addition to the taxes previously existing, the Pasha of Excise and Egypt levied excise and custom duties on grain and other imports to the amount, in some instances, of 10 per cent, on the latter. Animals carrying goods were likewise subject to a payment called Paatch for the repair of roads; there were 4 B 2556 taxes. [chap. xxi. also monopolies of salt, wine, spirits, &amp;c. The salian, which in old times had been levied by the sheikhs and others for the support of passing strangers ; and another tax, called Firdeh, were re-established. The latter was a war tax levied on houses and property to an amount varying between 15 and 500 pias tres, according to the supposed ability of the individual. All males above fifteen years of age were subject to this tax, and also to the intolerable grievance of a forced conscription, amounting to 10 per cent, of the most active men: But these oppressions have vanished with the restoration of the Sultans authority, and things have returned to their former state. The Land and tole- principal imposts now are the min, or land-tax, and the ration taxes. j ( } lara j j or toleration tax; the latter was exacted by Ibrahim Pasha on the male rayahs, or subjects who were not Muslims, at the rate of from 15 to 60 piastres for each person, instead of 3, 5, or 11, as formerly levied, 1 The former is a tax on as as much land as can be ploughed by a pair of oxen in eight hours; and according to the laws of the Sultans 'Omar and Selim, 2 it varies from a nominal rent of some barleycorns to as much as half of the produce. The import and other duties are particularly moderate, and, with the exception of the arbi- Avaniaa trary levies called avanias, which are too often oppressively increased by the local authorities for their own benefit, the inhabitants of Syria have but little of which they ought to complain ; still less have the slaves, who, as elsewhere in the East, form part of the family, and are treated as such.

The peasants generally have sufficient food and clothing, and either a horse or a mule; and ■ Volney's Travels, vol. 11., p. 410. For the taxes in the time of 'Omar see ahove, p. 253, &amp;c. Ibid.CHAP. XXI.] OCCUPATIONS OF THE PEOPLE. 557 a state of comfort prevails in their dwellings. The clothing, Dress of the although homely, is warm and substantial; it consists of coarse peasa,ltry ' shoes, or sandals, a small turban, flat at top with twisted cords pendant on one side, loose cotton trousers, and a close-fitting garment, between a cloak and a coat; the latter is made of thick woollen cloth, with narrow stripes of black and crimson alternately, without a collar, and partly open above in front; this, with a sash or belt above it, is almost the universal attire of the men throughout Syria. That of the women is likewise simple, being usually of coarse white cotton, and very full. The Druse females frequently wear a blue jacket and petticoat with some coins attached to the hair; but their chief ornament is a singular conical-shaped horn of chased silver, projecting about 18 inches from the forehead, 1 to which it is attached ; it is also balanced by a heavy weight behind the head; it is not removed even at night, and in the day-time the costume is completed by throwing a piece of white cotton over it, so as to envelope the whole person. In addition to household matters, the women assist their husbands in their agricultural labours; and their principal amusements consist in frequenting the bath and in forming Amusements parties for excursions into the country on Fridays, when some relaxation is permitted. The amusements of the men are also of a quiet cast, being chiefly confined to smoking, which they indulge in almost at all hours; frequenting the coffee-houses and baths, or having at home social meetings, when music, recitation, story-telling, and draughts, and occasionally an improvvisatore, are introduced. The town occupations consist in the exercise of the mecha- and occupa- nical arts : the men follow several useful trades, as those of people, smiths, carpenters, and bakers, these last being the most nu merous : besides the occupations already mentioned, a consi derable proportion of the population is constantly employed as mukeros, with their animals, in transporting goods from the ports, and also between the towns in the interior.

W. Thompson of Beirdt, Col. Campbell, lately consul-general for Egypt and Svria Mr. Fareen, previously consul-general of the latter country, and Her Majesty's consuls, Messrs. Werry and Moore. In every estimate some con siderable sections of the people, such as Turkomans, Kurds, and Syrians, have been left out; it is therefore probable that more extensive intercourse will show that the estimate in the text is rather below than above the true amount.( 559 ) CHAPTER XXII. arabia.

Geographically, the preceding territory forms a portion of arabia con- that which is about to be described, since by its south-eastern sydfand 1 * prolongation, the plateau of Syria forms the peninsula of Africa - Arabia, which ever has been one of the most interesting countries in the world. The physical structure of this exten sive region seems to belong to Africa, rather than Asia; whilst the almost uniform surface of its vast wilderness, like a great sea, at once separates and connects both continents. Arabia forms an irregular quadrangle, containing upwards its extent and of 22 degrees of latitude, from Thapsacus to Bab-el-Mandeb, and boundane8 - 26 of longitude, from Akabah to Ras el Hadd; the former being a distance of 1415, and the latter 1540 geographical miles; or, according to the Arabs, it is a journey of 100 days in a north-westerly direction, viz., from Aden to the borders of Syria. 1 Arabia is bounded on the west by the Red Sea, on the south and south-east by the Indian Ocean, on the east by the Gulf of Persia, on the north by the Upper Euphrates, Syria, &amp;c.; and it covers an area of more than 1,100,000 square geographical miles: thus it rather exceeds the magnitude of India within the Ganges, and consequently it is the greatest peninsula in the world. The ancients were well acquainted 1 Arabic MS. in the British Museum, p. 1502; translated by Dr. A. Sprenger.560 ARABIA IMPERFECTLY KNOWN. [CHAP. XXII. with it, but there has been so little intercourse between that country and Europe for several centuries, that our knowledge of the interior is now far short of that which was enjoyed by the Greeks and Romans. It is true that Arabia has lately been traversed by Euro peans, in different directions, but it will be seen by the routes of Niehbuhr, Burckhardt, Seetzen, and others, that only a comparatively small part has been visited; the rest would be quite a blank, were it not for the brief accounts given by Arabian authors, and such notices as have been handed down by Ptolemy and other ancient geographers. The vast tract lying between Syria and the Indian Ocean, offers a wide field for the extension of geographical knowledge, which may be obtained without any extraordinary difficulty or danger; for, with the exception of the mysterious fate of the intrepid Seetzen, there has not been a fatal journey into Arabia during the last 40 years ^ nor, perhaps, during a much longer period. In the preceding pages the mountain system of Syria has been carried from the Taurus to the termination of Wadi-el- Ghor. The latter encloses the southern extremity of the Dead Sea; and, as the name signifies, it is a tract lying between two ranges of mountains : this tract, here, as well as to the northward, is chiefly desert. The eastern side of Wadi el Ghor is intersected, and partly fertilized by several streams flowing along the Wadi Kurahy, and other valleys, amidst shrubs and verdure; but, on the opposite side, it is 1 There is little doubt that a prudent man, especially one of the medical profession, might make his way along the interesting line from Damascus to Shammarj and having explored Nedjd, in a southerly direction, in the first instance, he might turn his steps towards the countries of the Sabeans, Himya- rites, &amp;c.: this being accomplished, he could proceed at leisure from thence, by the route followed by Mr. Borowski along the borders of Hadramaiit and Mahrah, to the Persian Gulf at Maskat. Such an undertaking was recently commenced by Lieutenant Thomas Edmunds, 3rd Native Infantry, Assistant Resident at Kerrac, who, after taking a part in the late campaign in Syria, proceeded to Jiddah, where his exploratory journey was cut short by an illness which obliged him to proceed to Bombay; at that place the illness proved fatal, and deprived the service, as well as the community at large, of a valu able member.CHAP.

Here it is bounded by the pro- Valleys and longation of the hills of Esdum, a narrow ridge of rock salt, Edo ntain3 of with a coating of chalky limestone, which curves first to the south-west, then to the south, and finally sends out an offset lines of cliffs eastward. The latter, with the exception of the aperture caused by Wadi-el-Jeib, separates Wadi-el-Ghor from its southern prolongation, called Wadi Arabah, which only terminates at the Gulf of Akabah. The prolongation of this extensive depression has so much the appearance of the bed of a great river, that if its slope in the centre (Wadi- el-Jeib) did not tend towards the Dead Sea, one would exclaim that this is really the ancient bed of the Jordan. 1 Towards the southern extremity the valley has a width of about four miles, running N.N.E., between two chains of mountains, and is full of sand-drifts. 2 The mountains on the western side are from 1500 to 1800 feet high, and on the opposite side they rise to from 2000 feet to 2500 feet; but between them a marked difference prevails. The former chain, which borders the desert of El Tih, being wholly bare and sterile f whilst the latter is covered with tufts of herbs, and occasionally with trees. The mountains of Edom consist of a succession of nearly parallel ridges, which, eastward of the Arabah, have together a width of 15 or 20 miles. The wadis which they enclose are full of trees, shrubs, and flowers; whilst the upper slopes are extensively cultivated, though the higher part of the ridges, 4 particularly the peaks of Mount Seer or Hor, and the extraordinary masses of rock enclosing Wadi Miisa have a barren aspect. At about one-third of the distance from hence, along Supposed Wadi Arabah to the Dead Sea, is the supposed watershed, wldrlrabah having an almost imperceptible slope northward, and receiving a number of smaller valleys, such as Wadi Ghurundel, Wadi- el-Jerafeh, and others, which fall into the depression from each side. The great Wadi itself widens till, towards the northern extremity, it probably has a breadth, from side to 1 Count de Bertou, London Royal Geographical Journal, vol. IX., p. 279. 2 Dr. Robinson, vol.

But the most remarkable feature of this region is, the existence of the hollow called El Jeib; a wadi within a wadi, thus forming a second depression in the centre of the first, and running from south to north between high precipitous cliffs. 1 El Jeib gradually widens from its commencement near the supposed watershed till its breadth, on approaching the ridge of Akrabbim, is nearly halt a mile. 2 The position of these salt hills, which intervene between the Dead Sea and the higher level of the Arabah, and the existence of a watershed in the latter, are circumstances which sufficiently show that if the waters of the Jordan once flowed to the Red Sea, some convulsion of nature must have caused a depression of the whole of El Ghor, and likewise a partial change in the Arabah. The mountains bordering the eastern and western sides of this wadi, afterwards skirt the Gulf of Akabah till the former touch the eastern shore of the Red Sea, and the latter become part of the group of Sinai; so that first, under the name the Amanus, then under that of the Ansarian range, and, lastly, constituting the prolongation of the Lebanon, an almost continuous chain of mountains extends from the Taurus to the stupendous group called Jeb-el-Tor, by the Arabs. All are familiar, from infancy, with the name ot tne mountain from whose summit Moses brought the epitome of the Jewish laws. And Sinai has been so fully described by Maundrell, and other travellers, that in all probability we have a better knowledge of this spot, than of any other with which we are acquainted by description; but they who have ascended its peak can never forget the grand panorama pre sented to the view as the eye darts from one dark and lofty peak to another, till at length it rests upon the level space round Mount Horeb. From an elevation of 7530 feet, 3 a sea of mountains of red granite, deeply tinged with various shades of purple, presents itself in every direction; their rocky masses extending south ward to Mount St. Catherine and the Gulf of Suez, and again / Dr. Robinson, vol.

Over all this scene most of the narrow wadis being hidden, the spectator looks in vain for anything like a plain or valley, or even the appearance of verdure. St. Catherine, in the group of Sinai, is the culminating Branch from point of the mountains of Arabia Petreea: from this a great Catherine, branch runs in an east-south-easterly direction; and the mountain system of Arabia, which strongly resembles that of Iran, appears to have its root in this offset. The branch just mentioned winds along the western side of the territory for a distance of nearly 1400 miles, forming part of the lip of the vast basin of the Red Sea; on the other side of this sea there is a similar range, running parallel to, and at nearly an equal distance, from the African shore. The former, as has just been seen, is connected with the primitive formations of Asia Minor; and, in striking south-eastward, it first skirts the Gulf of Akabah with bare pinnacles of rugged trap or basalt, and then inclines a little more towards the interior: its succes sive groups are less or more connected together, and it makes a sweep round Medina, sending towards that city different offsets, such as Jebel Ohod, the scene of the most arduous of Muhammed's battles, Jebel Ayra, situated on the opposite or south-western side of the town ^ also Koba, El Kebleteyn, with others, which are chiefly composed of red granite. Onward the chain inclines towards the Red Sea, enclosing Mountains a succession of rocky defiles and occasionally plains, some of Mekkah and which, such as El Nazyr, 2 are of considerable extent; it after- Medma - wards changes its direction, sweeping round the eastern side of Mekkah under the name of Jeb-el-Kora, or Karrah; a bare rugged mass of calcareous rock, mixed with black flints and scattered masses of granite, and having the summits nearly on the same general level. Such is the prevailing formation as far as the former city; from whence, to the latter, por phyry, granite, and limestone rocks are found in the highest ridges, and calcareous masses in the lower.

It then curves round the eastern side of the Kaulan district, and under the general name of the mountains of Sana it inclines alternately towards the Red Sea and the interior till it terminates at the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb with the peak of Jeb-el-Manhali, which rises to the height of 865 feet. 1 In the previous part of its course the chain shows the peaks of Mount Rema, near Bei't-el-Fakih, which rises to 8000 feet, and Jeb-el-Saber, near Ta'ez, probably the highest point throughout the whole line. This mountain was ascended in 1836 2 by Monsieur Botta, who found an ancient castle on its crest. It is much furrowed by deep valleys, which are usually watered by per manent streams. The rest of the chain in these parts consists of rugged insulated masses of flint much broken into valleys ; on the artificial terraces of which the coffee plant is cultivated with great industry and success. 3 Several groups diverge from the main ridge and form infe rior chains less or more continuous; these cross Arabia in diffe rent directions, but principally run eastward till they meet the Persian Gulf, or the river Euphrates. Other ridges fol low the southern coast, presenting for the most part, in an extent of nearly 1250 miles ^ that is, from the entrance of the Red Sea to Ras-el-Hadd, innumerable hills of lime and sandstone, and perpendicular cliffs of bare rock, intermixed with shelving banks of white earth: they are without a tree, or the appearance of verdure. From Ras-el-Hadd the chain runs northward along the coast to Maskat and Cape Mus- sendom, and afterwards along the Persian Gulf. 1 Captain Haines, I.N., on the South Coast of Arabia: Royal Geographical Journal, vol.

In the latter the mountains - part of its course, that is, along the shore of the Persian Gulf, the chain presents a serrated outline, with rugged and desolate looking slopes, which, except a tint of purple, and this is observed early and late in the day, are of a barren fiery red; the chain consists probably, in great part, of limestone, except behind Tehameh, where schistus and basalt predominate. The rest of this range forms a high and rugged wall, com posed of frowning masses of granite, rising abruptly from the water, not unfrequently to an elevation of nearly 6000 feet; and is almost entirely destitute of soil and herbage. One uniform scorched dark-brown colour, often approaching to black, prevails almost to the entrance of the Persian Gulf; where, as has been seen, the chain has a no less desolate 1 Captain Haines' Chart, vol.

Other groups, forming portions of ranges, occur in the interior; of these there is one on the borders of Hadramaut; and there are others in Belad-el-J of; there are, also, some in the desert of Ahkaf and in 'Oman ; of all of which we know little more than that they take an easterly direction, especially those which skirt the latter district. 1 Nearly in the centre of the territory there is a considerable arm, which diverges from the main chain near Tai'f, and runs east-north-eastward from thence, passing a little distance north of Der' Ayyah, where the mountains have a barren appear ance. 2 Onward the chain inclines more eastward in passing through El Hassa, from whence it proceeds to the shores of the Persian Gulf, which it meets in the neighbourhood of Bahrein. Reinan, and subsequently Captain Sadleir, skirted these mountains during their journeys, and found them to be of moderate elevation, chiefly of sandstone rock, having their sides furrowed in parallel lines by the numerous torrents which exist in winter. Mountains again occur more north ward, which run into the interior from the neighbourhood of Medina, passing through the districts of El Kassyn, El Sedeir, and extending, it is presumed, to the Persian Gulf, near Grane, where they present a low range of crumbling sand- rock. Towards the northern limits of Nedjd is El Jebel Shammar, a district described by a Muslim traveller, Yusuph- el-Miliky, as having mountains as high as those of Lebanon, and covered with forests ; but the hills decrease in height, and become quite bare as they approach Mesopotamia. Between Shammar and the borders of Syria other and lower ranges are met with, which, on approaching the edge of the territory, present masses of sand-rock much resembling those of Persia, and having the appearance of huge crumbling walls. Again a double chain commences in the desert beyond Damascus, 1 Lieutenant Wellsted's Travels in 'Oman, &amp;c. 8 Captain Sadleir, vol. Ill, p. 412, of the Bombay Literary Society.CHAP.

One of its branches passes along the Mountains western side of Palmyra, whilst the other, the present boun- aboutPalm y ra - dary of Arabia on the north, skirts the eastern side of the great valley plain in which that city stood : the plain continues to be thus enclosed as far as the town of Zelebi. Here the chain is broken by the river Euphrates ; but, as we have seen, it is renewed beyond the river, and takes the direction of Sinjar. 1 These mountains gradually, from their commence ment, become more elevated till they enclose Palmyra, when they are apparently at the highest, having probably an eleva- vation of 2000 feet above the plain; they present to the view great masses of limestone and gypsum, and have a more regular outline than is usual with such rocks. Of precious stones, Arabia has the topaz, the onyx, and a Precious stones stone which is not found any where else, and is called yemanior and rnetals ' akil. 2 The agate is found near Mocha; emeralds, in the Hijar; beryls and cornelians near Sana and Aden ; 3 malachite in the cavern of Beni Salem; also jasper, amethysts, and turquoises, in the environs of the village of Safwa, about three days' journey from Medina. Diamonds, 4 the sardonyx, 5 and the topaz, 6 were obtained from this country in former times. Of metals, silver, iron, lead, and copper, 7 are met with in dif ferent parts of Arabia; and the last, recently in 'Oman. 8 Gold is mentioned by the ancient writers; and in all probability it will be found when the country is better explored, but it is not known to exist in Arabia at present. 9 Bitumen is obtained in Arabia Petrsea; and in Arabia Deserta, lignite coal. 10 At the northern extremity of the Dead Sea is found the stink-stone, stink-stone, whose combustible properties are ascribed by the 1 See above, p. 48. 4 Niehbuhr, Beschreibung des von Arabien, p. 142. 3 Niehbuhr, vol.

Here this rocky coast changes its direction, running south-westward to Abo- thubbee, then westward to Ras Macheereeb. It now trends northward to Has Reccan, which forms one horn of the deep bay of Bahrein ; along this it makes a western curve, and then trends N.W. to the Shatt-el-Arab; previously forming the three remarkable bays of Abothubbee, Katif, and Kouweit or Grane.

The last form, however, a distinct branch of trade; and though less valuable now than formerly, the writer had an opportunity of ascertaining, in 1836, that it produced more than 30 lacs of rupees, or upwards of 300,000/., which probably is a fair average of the yearly value. 1 From April to August, the winds are from the N.W., that Prevailing is, down the Gulf, sometimes blowing a fresh gale for about wind8 ' three days, but principally pleasant breezes with a portion of light winds. 8 In part of August, September, and October, there are winds from all quarters, but chiefly from the N.W., with light airs and calms. 3 During the remaining months the winds are variable, from N.W. to S.E., occasionally blow ing fresh, but generally with moderate force ; and land and sea breezes 4 are sometimes felt. In the central parts, and even along the eastern side of the Gulf, the navigation is sufficiently easy; but the survey by the Indian navy has shown that along the whole of the western coast rocks interspersed with some islands prevail; and one of the latter, Pheleche, shelters the harbour of Grane. Souths islands, ward are Khubbah, Guttart, Garrow, and Omahnaradam, with a coast almost unnavigable for nearly 80 miles south eastward, or as far as the Hargose, Farsey, and other islands composing Biddulph's group; and from hence shoals and pearl-banks extend eastward to Bahrein.

From hence the coast becomes bolder, and the sea less obstructed; and it continues so beyond the celebrated Arab town, fort, &amp;c., of Ras-el- Khaimah as far as the headland of Cape Mussendom; the coast trending south-eastward from thence is without islands, except in approaching Maskat and Ras-el-Hadd. As already observed, the outline is particularly wild and bold between those places, and it so continues to Bab-el-Mandeb, having in the interval the projecting capes of Ras Madrake, Monteval, Fartash, Baghashu', Makallah, and Aden, with the islands of Kuria and Muria close to the high and desolate-looking coast of Mazedra; and about 180 miles from thence is Socotra, an extensive island, long celebrated for its aloes.

Lastly, the islands of Jebel Zoogur, Uarnisli, and Perim, tlie last being situated in tlie Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. These, and thousands of islets between them, are coral formations, and are constantly increasing; the bed of the sea itself is also covered with coral, and from hence is derived the Hebrew name, Bahr-souph (Sea of Sea-weed). The islands, with almost the single ex ception of Kamran, being deprived of harbours, they become a serious impediment to any navigation but that of steam, and the vessels have to pass up and down a narrow sea which has been aptly compared by Strabo to a salt river; that writer describes it as full of rocks, enclosed by high mountains, and into which no river, and scarcely any rain falls. Owing to the winds, barriers formed on each side by the mountains, the changes of the seasons cause a strong north-west wind to prevail down the Red Sea from the middle of May, with little or no intermission till September, and upwards, or towards Suez, during the rest of the year; and experience has taught the Arabs here, as in the Persian Gulf, to commence their annual voyages towards the close of the favourable monsoon, and return with the next, so as to have a fair wind along either the African or Arabian shore. Although this trade includes the principal as well as the inferior places along both coasts, it must of necessity be limited, but at the same time it is cheap and certain. The existence of a fresh-water lake at El Asha, 1 and several in Nejd, as ascertained by Captain Sadleir, has esta blished the fidelity of Strabo in this particular. 2 There are others, but of small size, in Arabia Felix, in Tehameh, 3 and in 'Oman, and one called Salome has recently been discovered by Monsieur Chedufau and Colonel Mary in Ahkaf. 4 But the rest of the surface of Arabia appears to be without any thing like 1 'Vol. III., p- 464, of the Bombay Literary Society. 2 Lib.

[CHAP, XXII. a body of fresh water, and even salt lakes are almost equally rare, the Bahr-el-Merj, eastward of Damascus, the lake near Palmyra, and one or two elsewhere, being all that are known to us at present. Except the Euphrates, which washes Arabia for about 977 miles, and a stream rising eastward of San'a, which is said to The Sayi or pass through Hadramaut to the sea at Kaijah, also the Sayl or Bicheh, which flows from the province of Asir eastward through the valley of pawasir, and onward into lake Salome, it may be said that there is no other considerable river within its limits, and there are comparatively few rivulets. It is true that the valleys now and then have large streams which are fed by the mountain dews, but for the most part these exist only in the winter season, and they are confined chiefly to the western side of the great range forming the watershed which so unequally divides the territory. On the other side, as at Nedjd, they are lost in plains, marshes, or lakes. 1 Wadis. The workings of such winter torrents produce valleys, and these, whether dry or containing water, whether barren or cultivated, the Arabs call either ghadirs or wadis ; they are very numerous, and are altogether the most remarkable fea tures of the country. The wadis have hills on both sides, rising above the surface of the adjacent plain ; the ghadir, on the contrary, is only a hollow in the plain. 2 Mirage. The distress occasioned in Arabia by a deficiency of water is frequently increased by the tantalizing appearance presented by the sirab or mirage in that country. The light refracted in the rarified air immediately above the heated ground gives rise to the resemblance of an extensive lake, and the thirsty traveller, advancing towards it, finds the flattering delusion recede before him. In the early part of the morning, while some dew remains on the ground, the perception is remarkably strong; every object is then also magnified, so that shrubs appear as trees, and under them frequently appear their images inverted, as if reflected from the surface of water.

A general level - narrow strip of land forms its boundary on the eastern and western sides, and on the southern coast a belt of rocks con nects the two preceding tracts. The eastern depression, or that which forms one side of the basin of the Euphrates and the western shore of the Persian Gulf, is comparatively narrow, but in the upper part very fertile ; that of Tehameh on the opposite side of the territory is wider; it extends almost the whole way along the Arabian Gulf, and it is but partially cultivated, although the soil is sufficiently good. The re mainder is an elevated plateau, containing probably five-sixths of the superficies of the whole peninsula. It slopes gently both northward and eastward, till, in the former direction, it merges in the plains of Syria, and in the latter it joins the range of hills which separates it from the plain running along the basin of the Euphrates and the western shores of the Per sian Gulf.

Nature of (he covered in many places with pebbles and flints, generally pre- S011 ' vails, and here, as in Persia, the apparent aridity of the ground may well justify the opinion that it had never borne a crop. Such is the statement of many writers, who, never theless, have inconsistently admitted that the country sup ports a numerous population, with flocks of sheep and goats, besides camels and horses. Delia Valle, Captain Jenour, 1 and Colonel Capper 2 have, however, given more favourable ac counts. Numerous flocks constitute the wealth of the Beda- win, who wanders from pasture to pasture over a wilderness which, as we shall presently see, produces a sufficiency for the wants of its pastoral inhabitants. The impression so generally prevails that the interior of Arabia is covered with deep moving sands like those in the deserts of Libya and Zahara, that it is with some hesitation an account yery different in this respect is now about to be presented to the reader. It is true that, as in the case of the extensive territory of 'Iran, the cultivated land is by far the smaller proportion, and the remainder presents, in different 1 Route to India in September, 1785. 4 Journey to India.574 DESERTS OF ARABIA. [CHAP. XXII. Sandy deserts, places, the four descriptions of desert already noticed; but happily the worst and most forbidding portion forms the ex ception. The deep sand which characterizes this kind of desert is found at certain places in 'Oman and Tehameh, and again in the level tract near the upper part of the shores of the Red Sea, also in some spots about the lower Euphrates, likewise in El Asha, and probably at intervals in the deserts of Ahkaf and Roba-el-Khali. In these tracts nature denies all verdure and every kind of tree or shrub, with the exception of the date-tree, whose roots, in some spots, find moisture, stony deserts. Another kind, which presents a hard baked surface of flints and pebbles caked together and seemingly quite impenetrable, also forms- part of the surface of Arabia. This is scantily supplied with verdure, but it displays a few hardy shrubs, and now and then some deep purple-coloured lilies, which are almost leafless. Salt deserts. A third description, the salt desert, is more common. Saline tracts with a brittle cracked surface are met with eastward of Palmyra, and in other parts of Arabia Deserta; also in El Asha and Nejd, and doubtless in Roba-el-Khali. In these parts of the territory are found the soap-plants, sheinan and el kali, with occasionally the rhetem, or camel-thorn, and even the leafless purple iris. Somewhere towards the eastern side of the Roba-el-Khali, an extensive plain covered with a quick sand of great depth, has recently been met with by Baron Von Wrede, who was unable to find a bottom with a line of 60 feet. 1 TheBarr. These unpromising tracts have probably given rise to the belief that Arabia is merely a vast arid desert, either inter spersed with spots of fertile ground 2 or almost entirely a de sert, 3 whereas the greatest part is of the fourth kind, called Barr 4 by the Arabs, which, in fact, is merely an uncultivated land, 5 diversified with hill and dale, like the Dorsetshire downs.

Seated. 7 Cul ' Moreover, we learn from sacred as well as profane history, that the Ethiopians, the Assyrians, the Hebrews, and the Egyptians crossed the wilderness of Arabia at various times with immense armies, and consequently the country could not have been then a barren desert: the practicability of such movements was evident to me in my two journeys from and to Damascus. During the first, which was towards the end of the autumn of 1830, the coolness, even in the day time, rendered a cloudless sky desirable, whilst we suffered severely from frost at night. In the second journey, which was in the summer of 1837, the heat was very oppressive during the greater part of the day, but the nights were most agreeable. We were gratified also from sun-set to day-break, and more especially in the evenings and mornings, by the sweetly cheering notes of the nightingale, issuing from the liquorice bushes, which generally covered the plain; but as we approached the lower temperature, at the foot of the Syrian mountains, we no longer heard this unexpected tenant of the wilderness. 1 Malte-Brun mentions this bird as being met with in that portion of the peninsula which is so gene rally considered altogether desert, and where most certainly there is but little cultivation. To the observations made by Monsieur Mengin, whilst Sources of serving with Ibrahim Pasha s army, as well as those of Cap- respecting it. tain Sadleir, whilst crossing from El Katif to the shores of the Red Sea, and to the verbal narration of M.

Almost the only notices previously obtained were drawn from the works of Yusuf-el-Miliky or other oriental writers, and from an English traveller of the name of Reinaud ; 2 to which may be added the recollections of Mr. Rassam, who, when quite a boy, accompanied Ibn Wahidol into Arabia. 1 This is the bulbul of Syria and the nightingale of England; the bulhul of Persia is our thrush.—See Ainsworth's Assyria and Chaldea, p. 43. 2 See Zach's Corresp., vol.

Journey of This journey continued for several months, during which time the tribe, whose guest he was, continued moving from one pasturage to another, making zigzag wanderings from Hillah almost to the shores of the Red Sea; visiting those tribes who were friendly, and avoiding the others, as is the custom with the children of the East. No interruption was experienced, nor did either water or pasture fail, which must have been the case if the interior of Arabia were merely a wilderness of sand. Mr. Rassam was so young, and the period is now so distant, that he can give but few details concerning the country. But although he saw not the numerous cities of Arabia Felix which are named by Ptolemy, 1 nor the palaces and temples which may have existed in the five kingdoms into which that region is said to have been divided, 2 still his account, as well as that given by other individuals, make it clear that the country is partially cultivated, and more thickly peopled than is commonly supposed. 3 Numerous ruins show, however, that many tracts now occupied by the Bedawins had at one time fixed inhabitants; but it remains to be ascertained whether beds and hills of moving sand, such as those in Baluchistan, 4 are very frequent in Arabia. 5 southwestern In a countr y 011 tile ver g e and partly within the tropics, territory. deprived at the same time of shade as well as of a due supply of water, a parched soil and extreme heat are naturally to be expected.

The extreme heat of summer is, in consequence of the elevation, much lessened; whilst at night there is frost, and even snow- occasionally during the winter months. Moreover, the mis chievous and oppressive effects of the heat are diminished hy the dews; without which, says Niehbuhr, no vegetables could exist in such places as Mekkah and Mokha. 1 In Yemen, and towards the shores of the Red Sea, some rain falls in spring, but the periodical rains begin in June, and end in Periodical September; whilst, on the opposite slopes of the range of rain8 ' mountains, the rainy season continues as late as the middle of November. More eastward, on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and the banks of the Euphrates, the rains begin towards the commencement of December and end at the beginning of March; about the upper Euphrates the rains continue still longer. The fact of occasional rains in Nedjd during the summer is mentioned by Captain Sadleir, 2 and also by Mengin, who witnessed them during the sieges carried on in that country by the Pasha. In general an agreeable freshness prevails throughout the Purity of the great plateau of Arabia ; which country for its extent is pro- air ' bably one of the healthiest in the world. Indeed the air of the wilderness shews its purity, not only by giving a long and healthy life to the Bedawin, but likewise by its beneficial effects on those who enjoy it only for a time; an instance of the salu brity of the climate was afforded in the case of the officers and men of the late expedition, when returning from Baghdad under Major, now Lieut.-Col. Estcourt. Tried as they had previously been, by hard work and exposure, the journey was regarded with apprehension ; but scarcely was it commenced when an improvement was perceptible; and before the wide- spreading wilderness was exchanged for the verdant suburbs of Damascus every individual found himself greatly improved in health, if not entirely recovered.

They stated, that, generally speaking, the surface soil in the countries which they tra versed, would not admit of being raised in columns sufficiently dense to inflict such a calamity, and that whatever may have occurred in the African desert, nothing of the kind, to their knowledge, has taken place in Arabia. 3 The simoom, however, they added, is hot and suffocating, and has frequently caused the death of persons who have been unable to shelter them- 1 The^Universal History, vol. XXXVI., p. 457 (London, 1779), says that between the cities of Mekkah and Medina there is an extensive sandy desert, where the dry sands blown up and down by the winds often overwhelm whole caravans. At p. 438 of the same volume, speaking of Arabia Deserta, we are told that there are neither men, beasts, birds, trees, grass, nor pasture to be seen; nor any thing but great rolling sands and craggy mountains.

Time of sowing Wheat and barley are sown about the beginning of March, corn ' and towards the end of May or beginning of June they are reaped ; but scarcely has the crop been housed (which takes place about the middle of June) when the surface immediately assumes^ that parched appearance which has been remarked under similar circumstances in Iran. 1 But if we exclude the sandy, the indurated, and the pebbly portions of the surface, the soil is adapted for cultivation; the want of trees to preserve moisture, and the scarcity of water being the chief obstacles to the success of the agriculturist. The soil consists of good clay, which becomes sufficiently productive whenever the Arab turns his attention to husbandry, and to what is in such countries its most indispensable branch, the management of water. At present the supply of his flocks depends upon wells, which are often at considerable distances from one another, and not unfrequently on his arrival at one he is denied the expected refreshment in consequence of the pre- ProbabiHty of sence of another tribe. It is, however, more than probable, if foSgationf 1 sufficient pains were taken, by sinking Artesian shafts, 2 that &amp;c - water would be found at a moderate depth throughout nearly the whole of Arabia; and if a system of khanats like those in 'Oman and Persia were to be added, so as to convey water to a distance, in all probability a sufficient quantity would be obtained not only to irrigate and fertilize many places which at present are desert, but even to renew the productive state which existed at a former period. At this day cultivation is found round Doom and the three villages of Taifie, Jerood, and Attane, on the caravan route between Damascus and Pal myra. On the same route there is also Karyatein, which is sheltered by trees, well watered, and contains about 800 houses. Even round Palmyra itself there is much ground under tillage; and besides what is observed in Arabia Felix, Oman, &amp;c., in parts of Arabia Petrsea, at the distance of four 1 See above, pp. 78, 79. 2 Such as those described in Buckland's treatise on Geology and Mine ralogy, vol.

The Sherarat Arabs hunt them, and eat their flesh, but not before strangers. 14 Among domestic animals, owing to its great importance. The camel, the first place must be given to the camel, a creature admi rably suited for traversing boundless plains and deserts, not only from the peculiar construction of his feet, but owing to the valuable property of possessing a second stomach, or rather a kind of cell or separation, which is sufficiently capa cious to retain water for many days, his food being carried in another part of the stomach. A kind of dough called maabouk, consisting of chaff and barley, or barley meal and chopped straw, some of the seed of cotton being usually added, is made into a sort of loaf, about three pounds weight, and forced down his throat; and with this food, in addition to the grass 1 Burckhardt's Bedawin and Wahhdbi, p. 126.

According to the statement of some travellers he can travel without water for nine days, or even 20 days in extreme cases. Importance of The camel is in every way constituted to be the chief com- the camel. ^ of and one of tlie choicest gifts he could have re ceived from a beneficent providence ; for without his assistance the countries in which he is chiefly used must have been almost without any commercial intercourse. Indeed the Bedawin could no more traverse his native country without the assistance of this animal than a maritime people could cross the seas with out ships ; and this invaluable creature has in consequence been happily designated a living ship, or the ship of the desert. The Bactrkn There are two kinds of camel; that of Central Asia, called camel J. rian bocht, or the Bactrian camel, is a low, bony, heavy-looking, but powerful animal, covered with long shaggy hair of a deep brown colour tinged with black, and having two humps ; the other, which belongs to both Arabia and Africa, has but one hump. The latter animal is of a much lighter make, and is covered with short smooth hair, sometimes of a cream colour, but usually a light brown. He stands several inches higher than the Bactrian camel, and can bear heat much better. There is, however, a perceptible difference between the size of the animal used in the interior of Arabia and that which is bred towards the northern and eastern limits of the territory. The Syrian camel, for instance, as well as that belonging to Upper Mesopotamia, is larger and more hairy than those of Nedjd, which are considered the choicest breed, and, in con sequence, the Arabs call this country Om-el-Bel (mother of camels). In addition to the different classes, the Arabs distin guish the age and other states of the camel by particular names, and each tribe has a particular mark to distinguish the camels belonging to it from those of other tribes, the different marks being not fewer than 80. The average burthen of the strength of the Arabian camel rather exceeds 800 lbs., 2 and that of the Bac- cameL trian camel is between ten and fifteen hundred weight. 1 Skinner's Journey to India, vol. II., p. 112. 2 A calculation of the loads of 800 camels gave 830 lbs. each.CHAP. XXII.] THE CAMEL. 583 The dromedary also is of two species, the Bactrian and the The dromedary. Arabian. Those of the former kind have two humps, whilst the latter have only one. This class of animal is light and fleet on which account he is kept and trained exclusively for speed, pretty much as the race-horse is kept in Europe. In Arabia there are three classes of camels with one hump; the first, which is the largest and clumsiest, called khowwas. The khowwas. is used to carry heavy burthens at the slow and measured pace of a large caravan. Those of the second class, called deloul, or saddle camels, are selected when young from the former, and, being more active, they are employed on journeys singly, or with light caravans consisting of similar animals. In Arabia the creature is guided by the voice, with the assistance of a stick gently applied against the off side of the neck ; but in Africa and India, a nose-ring and cord reins are used. To give an idea of their strength it may here be mentioned Rate of walk- that with four of these animals the writer crossed from Basrah ing ' to Damascus, a distance of 958^ miles, in the space of 19 days and a few hours (the average rate being more than 54 miles in 24 hours); the camels having no other food than that which they picked up in the wilderness. The pace of the animal measured 6 feet 5 inches, and from 44 to 46 paces were taken per minute. 1 The third class possesses as much superiority over the ordi- Swiftness of the nary camel, as our race-horse does over the farm-horse; it bears the name of Hajin in Arabia, Maherry in Africa, Hur- kary in Asia, and it is the dromedary of the Hebrew Scrip tures. 2 This animal is lightly formed, and of a very pale brown, approaching a cream colour. Being well trained, his speed with a man on his back and no baggage, is between eight and nine miles per hour, and he can accomplish, at the utmost, about 70 miles in 24 hours for two or three days in succession. On one occasion Muhammed All, with organized relays, sent an express to Ibrahim Pasha, concerning the British Expe dition, which occupied only five-and-a-half days between Cairo 1 This was the average of many calculations taken with a stop-watch. 2 1 Kings, chap.

Those of Nedjd are m very high estimation ; but the best, according to Edrisi, belong to the people called Mehret or Mahrak, among whom the animal is taught to understand what is to be done, and to dis tinguish the name by which he is called. 3 In this part of the country, the camel is fed upon a kind of dried fish. Mule camel. Besides the Bactrian camel, the Turkomans have a mule breed between this and the Arabian animal, with a hump which can neither- be called single nor double, though more near the latter than the former. This is a large, useful, and highly prized animal, capable of transporting from 1,000 to 1,200 lbs. with ease ; but the creature is short-lived, and the Arabs do not breed from him ; giving as a reason, that the progeny are intractable, and bad-tempered.

XXII.] THE HORSE. 585 of the chest. Captain Sadleir speaks of the employment o f the The camel used camel at Remah in Nedjd, in drawing water from deep wells ; for drau 8 ht - and the guns of the Pasha were drawn by camels from the shores of the Red Sea, to Der'ayyah, when that place was besieged. 1 Lieutenant Wellsted also mentions their being used in 'Oman for the former purpose. 2 Camels are occasionally put to the plough in Afghanistan, and they sometimes work the water-pulleys on the borders of Arabia. We applied, as an experiment, six camels to one of the heavy carriages of the Expedition, and they appeared to answer the purpose. Next, in point of utility, but first in estimation, is the horse, Description of an animal displaying those qualities which might be expected horse™ ian from him in his original country. Elsewhere, individuals of this species may be more showy, and even more powerful, but it is only in Arabia that the horse is found in a state border ing on perfection. Here he is remarkable for a small head with pointed ears, peculiarly clean muscular limbs, a corre sponding deliate slender shape, rather small size, and large animated eyes, expressing that intelligence which, as in the dog, is the consequence of being constantly with the members of his master's family; in fact, he generally shares their meals. He is frequently allowed to frolic through the camp like a dog, and at other times he is piqueted at the entrance of the tent; he is exposed to the weather at all times, and compared with the treatment of his species in Europe, he is scantily fed. A meal after sunset, consisting of barley, in some parts of the country, and camel's milk in others, or a paste of dates and water, which in Nedjd is mixed with dried clover and other herbs, constitutes his usual sustenance ; but on any extraordinary exertion being required, flesh is fre quently given, either raw or boiled. The Bedawins count five noble breeds of horses, all, it is Fi^nobie understood, derived originally from Nedjd, viz., the taneyse, the manekeye, the koheyl or koklani, the saklawye, and the julfa; of which the last and the koklani are particularly prized. The julfa, a small active animal, capable of enduring 1 See Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society, vol. III., p. 469. 2 Travels in 'Omdn, &amp;c., vol. I., p. 437.586 KINE. [CHAP. XXII. The breeds of great fatigue, 1 belongs to the province of El Ah'sa; the other, horses various, jg larger, is from Yemen, or more properly Nedjd, and is most valued. Of the choice breeds there are many branches; there are besides, other breeds, which are considered secondary, and every mare of noble blood, if particularly swift and hand some, may give rise to a new stock. The catalogue of distinct breeds in the desert is therefore almost endless, and the pedi grees of individuals are verified by certificates which are handed down from father to son with infinite care, and not unfre- quently they belong to more than one family, for there is often a co-partnership in mares, and hence arises the difficulties attending the purchase of one. It is, however, certain that the Arab horses deteriorate when taken elsewhere, although both sire and dam may be of first-rate breeds ; by the latter, and not the former, as with us, the Arabs trace the blood. The prevailing colours are a clear bay, sorrel, white, chestnut, gray, brown, and black ; but the number of horses in Arabia, is comparatively few ; 2 their places, for almost every purpose in life, being supplied by camels. Buffaios. Next to the latter, in point of number, are the buffalos, which are to be found in most places where water is abundant; their milk is rich and tolerably good, although inferior to that of the goat or cow. Bulls and cows take the next place to the buffalo, and like those of India, they have humps, and are of small size; some bullocks purchased at Suweidiyeh, produced each, only about 224 lbs. of meat. The ass. Besides the preceding animals, the country possesses asses and mules, both of large size; the former are often white, and are prized on this account, as well as for their speed and easy paces. The ass is probably the original animal of its kind in the country, for it is first mentioned in connexion with this part of the world, 3 and it was afterwards considered as a royal animal. 1 On one occasion the writer rode upwards of 1000 miles upon a small Arab horse. The animal had a good feed of barley at the halting-place every night, and he completed the journey in perfect condition. 2 The writer has seen a large tribe with only two or three horses, and at times without any. 3 Gen., ch. XII., v. 16; Exodus, ch. IV., v. 20.CHAP. XXII.] DOMESTIC ANIMALS. 587 Goats are very numerous throughout the country, and sheep Goats and still more so; the latter are of the large-tailed breed, and they 8lie6p ' yield good wool; the average weight of each is about 40 lbs.; the mutton is excellent, and generally at the low price of one penny per pound. Like our own cottages, the Arab hut, or house, is seldom The cat. without a cat, occasionally of the large Persian breed, 1 but generally the common domestic animal like that of England. Mixed breeds are also to be found in the country. The dog is The dog. still more general; for, contrary to the received opinion, he is met with everywhere in the East, both in towns and in the country, except at Medina; this faithful animal is almost as much cherished by the Syrians and Arabians as by Europeans, whether a wretched mongrel, or belonging to one of the pure breeds. Of the latter kind, is the fierce companion of the wandering Turkoman, with its long ears and winter coating of long soft hair. The shepherd-dog is not inferior to our own in any respects. There is also the town or bazar dog. Bazar dog. besides crosses of the dog and wolf and the dog and fox. Dogs of a particular kind are seen in great numbers about, and gene rally forming the only sentinels of every Bedawin encamp ment ; but the most striking animal of this class is the Mace donian greyhound, which, with the usual addition of a hawk perched near the entrance of the tent, forms part of the suite of a sheikh, or other chief, throughout most parts of the East. This animal is about the height of a full-sized English grey hound, but rather stouter; he is deep-chested, has long smooth hair of a blood-red colour, and a tail nearly as much feathered as that of an Irish setter. 2 His speed does not quite equal that of our highest bred dogs, but he keeps it up so much longer that he is tolerably certain of running down the fleetest gazelle. Ostriches are found in the great Syrian desert, especially in Ostriches, the plain extending from the Haouran towards Jebel Shammar and Nedjd. Some of them are found in the Haouran itself, and a few are taken almost every year, even within two days' journey of Damascus; this is accomplished in the following manner: 1 Katta aiemi. 8 Pl ate XXIII.

Towards evening the ostriches return, and not perceiving any enemy resume their places, generally both at once, upon the eggs; the gun in due time is discharged, and the Arab finds next morning one of the ostriches, or frequently both, killed upon the spot. 1 The mkhama. Another large bird occasionally appeared passing southward in such great flocks as to cover the swelling hills of north western Arabia with their tall erect figures ; seen on the hills at a distance they looked like a force clad in pale gray, with sentinels and outposts carefully placed on the flanks to give notice of the approach of an enemy from any quarter. All our efforts failed in approaching this wary bird even within rifle distance. It appeared to stretch its head upwards like the ostrich to a height of more than four feet, and was uni formly of a pale gray colour, like the heron; the name given to it by the Arabs was rukhama. Various other In another place, the tall bird called tair-el-raouf, which frequents the north-western border of Arabia, has been described f and the general list in the Appendix contains the cinereous, the Gesnerian, and other vultures, bonellis and other eagles, several falcons, four kinds of owl, pelicans of the largest size, also a variety of aigrettes and king-fishers, the kat, a kind of pigeon, covering the plain in thousands, also different sorts of bustard; the same list will show that crows, sparrows, and almost all other European birds and tame fowls are here to be found. It is understood that in Nedjd and the southern parts of the territory, the pheasant, the jungle-fowl, the Guinea-fowl, also a bird with beautiful plumage, called thaer-el-hind, are met with; and Niehbuhr notices some about Aden, but they are as yet undescribed. Reptiles. Among the reptiles and insects are serpents of several kinds, 1 Burckhardt's Bedawin and Wahhdbi, p. 123; also Colonel Capper's Journey to India, pp. 62 and 68. 2 See above, p. 444.CHAP. XXII.] REPTILES AND AQUATIC ANIMALS. 589 lizards, scorpions, centipedes, wasps, bees, tortoises, and lizards; Locusts, rats and mice are also numerous, and of various kinds. Myriads of locusts appear occasionally in every part of Arabia, Persia, Mesopotamia, &amp;c. When a cloud of those devouring insects approached Aleppo in 1835, Ibrahim Pasha, with his usual decision, sent out the whole of the garrison, and all the men, women, and children of Aleppo, to collect them; each indi vidual being forced, under a penalty, to produce a certain quantity, amounting to many thousands. Burckhardt observes that, in Arabia, locusts are known to come invariably from the east, and the Arabs accordingly say they are produced by the waters of the Persian Gulf. The province of Nedjd is particularly exposed to their ravages; and they sometimes overwhelm it to such a degree, that having destroyed the harvest, they penetrate by thousands into the dwellings and Their ravages, devour whatever they can find, even the leather of the water- vessels. The Bedawin, as well as the inhabitants in Nedjd, the Hijas, &amp;c., are accustomed to eat the locusts. The Arabs, in preparing them as an article of food, throw them alive into boiling water, with which a good deal of salt has been mixed; after a few minutes they are taken out and dried in the sun; the head, feet, and wings are then torn off, the bodies cleansed from the salt, and perfectly dried in the sun, after which pro cess whole sacks are filled with them. They are sometimes broiled in butter : the Arabs of Sinai alone do not eat them. 1 In the rivers are found, as low as Ana, the beaver, the The beaver. otter, 2 and, as is asserted, the crocodile, or alligator ; 3 also the tortoise, the turtle, the trionyx or gymnossus, which is described in the Appendix. The rivers also abound with fish, especially carp and barbel; and in addition to these are the eel, and the celebrated black fish called semmak-el-aswad, 4 commonly called the cat-fish, which is about two feet long, 1 Bedawin and Wahhdbl, p. 268. 9 In the Lamlum marshes; see the Travels of Ives, p. 255. They are also frequently met with in the upper part of the Euphrates. 8 One was seen several times by the officers of the Expedition, but they failed in obtaining a specimen, notwithstanding their own exertions and those of the natives; the latter were, however, quite aware of its existence. 4 Macropteronotus.—Ainsworth's Assyria, &amp;c., p. 45.590 SPICES AND CORN.

Great quantities are brought up this way, and sent to Aleppo. Mr. Ainsworth calls them magur, from the name of a fish in the Ganges. Spices, &amp;c. The more valuable productions of Arabia are nutmegs, 1 frankincense, myrrh, and other spices, 2 senna leaves, aloes, and cassia, odorous woods, different balsams, and even indigo ; this valuable commodity is often mentioned by old writers, and it is still found westward of the Red Sea. The indigo shrub of Arabia 3 is of an inferior kind, but it is used by the people of the country, who, when it happens to be scarce, contrive to extract a dye from a species of polygala. 4 The crowfoot, hore- hound, buckler mustard, trefoil, treacle mustard, whitlow grass, camomile, fescar grass, hawkweed, and ox-eye, are also met with in Arabia. 5 General pro- The borders of Mesopotamia, the western shores of the auctions. p ers i an Gulf, and the eastern shore of the Red Sea, together with portions of Arabia Petrsea and Deserta, and the extensive provinces of Yemen, Nedjd, El Ah'sa, Tehameh, and Oman, are partially cultivated; and the general products of the country consist of soap, wool, cotton, indigo, goats hair, tobacco, wheat, rice, barley, honey, millet, Indian corn, dhurrak, salt, sulphur, sesamum, manna, and the castor oil plant.

On the banks 0 f northofArabia - the Euphrates we find alder, silver poplar, weeping willow, oak, ash, the plane-tree, sycamore, beech, walnut, and almost everywhere the tamarisk. On the borders of Armenia, above the frontiers of Arabia, the pine is very abundant; and like the other trees, it attains a great size. In Nedjd it is understood that there are considerable forests, Forests in such as that of Shammar, which is described by Yusuf-el- Ned ^ d ' &amp;c ' Miliki as being very extensive ; the timber in that forest had suffered very much during the preceding campaign of Ibrahim Pasha, but Captain Sadleir mentions having seen in his journey a good deal of wood in other parts of the province; the tama risk he found large enough to roof houses. The forests of Aden and Hadramaut are mentioned by Niehbuhr; and fine large walnut and other trees were recently seen at several places in the oases of 'Oman by the latest traveller who has described the country. 1 Elsewhere, in the interior, are found the custard apple {Anana reticulata), mulberry, orange, lemon, lime, and other fruit-trees; but compared to the great extent of surface, these are, like the population, very thinly scattered over the country. Besides the date-tree, whose branches and fibres serve for Fruits, so many domestic uses in Arabia, and whose fruit, from its quantity, superior quality, and general use to persons, whether at home or on a journey, may justly be regarded as a common necessary of life, the fruits of the country are citrons, 2 figs, pears, quinces, tamarinds, almonds, apricots, apples, plantains or bananas, grapes, 3 melons, pumpkins, mangos, 4 pomegranates, oranges, lemons, plums, figs, peaches, blackberries, and wal nuts, the produce of trees of large growth in 'Oman. 5 In Wadi Gharendel, as well as elsewhere, there is a small juicy red 1 Lieutenant Wellsted, I.N. 2 In 'Oman; see Lieutenant Wellsted, vol.

Wax and honey are plentiful; the Hijaz, in every part of its mountains, abounds with the latter, but that from the south of Taif is most esteemed. 5 Grapes of the best quality grow in the mountains behind Mekkah f and in addition to these, the dried apricot, reduced to a paste, is received all over Arabia from Damascus. Mixed with water it makes a refreshing drink, and being portable it constitutes a portion of the food on a journey, especially for the Turkish troops. 7 The celebrated dyes of ancient Tyre, and the blue cloths and broidered work, of which the last is said to have been car ried from Babylon in chests made of cedar bound with cords, 8 have, like the cities themselves, passed away, and the commerce of Arabia is only a feeble remnant of what it once was. 1 The Peganum retusum.—Burckhardt's Travels in Syria, p. 474. a The Peganum. 8 Gossypium herbaceum.—Lieutenant Wellsted's Travels, vol.

The last might be rendered Soap, a much more considerable article of trade, being of excellent quality. It is made from the ashes of the plants called chuddraife, rugge, cutlaif, samah, and shiman; and the last, which produces the best quality, abounds in the country east ward of Damascus. 2 It has a soft juicy stalk, of a yellowish brown colour, resembling in its form coral, or rather the sam phire plant, but somewhat rounder. It grows to the height of 18 inches or 2 feet, and the Arabs perfectly understand how to burn and prepare it. The productions above enumerated are either sold, orimport«. exchanged for steel, lead, tin, copper, and iron utensils, boots, shoes, ammunition pouches, and other articles of leather; together with swords, fire-arms, ammunition, carpet-stuffs, besides articles of clothing, including shawls and muslins, which are received from India on one side, and from Europe, principally Great Britain, on the other. 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

But these designations are unknown to the inhabitants.of the country; and it seems most proper to conform to the distribu tion which is followed at the present time both by the natives and foreigners. Modern dis- According to the Arabs and Turks, the peninsula contains, independently of the islands, fifteen districts, three of which are entirely desert; viz..

Bounds of the The long tract of the Hijaz, or holy land of the Muslimi, ^iljaz ■ has the territory of Nedjd for its eastern, and the Red Sea for its western limits, and it extends northward along the latter from the Bay of Kurne so far as to include the greater part of Arabia Petrsea. Arabia Petrsea, or Stony Arabia, accurately characterizes the tract to which the name is applied, and its limits are well defined. It has Lake Asphaltes and a part of Syria to theCHAP.

This tract, therefore, comprises the mountainous peninsula of Sinai and the desert of El Tih to the north-west, and from hence it stretches southward till it includes Mount Hor and Wadi Musa, or the whole of the district of Schera and Jebal, toge ther with Moab, Ammon, and the country northward of Bozra 1 as far as Ezra. Throughout most of the distance from Ezra to Suez the country presents, especially in the Ledja and Haouran, masses of solid rock, or circular belts of stone, separated by deep and narrow crevices, which are crossed with great difficulty. 2 Notwithstanding the limited spaces which, between the Ancient cities, rocks, are fit for cultivation, the region eastward of the Jordan and Dead Sea once possessed the splendid Roman cities now known by the names of Amman, Jerash, Bozra, Kanouat, Shobba, Shaara, with many others, besides numerous smaller towns scattered over that part of the country; therefore when Stony Arabia constituted the chief part of the kingdom of Aretas, the people must have partly depended upon imports for a supply of corn, and on cisterns or large tanks 3 for water, as tljere are very few streams in this district. There are, as has been seen, many villages scattered along inhabitant, the north-western frontiers of the tract under consideration, particularly in the Loehf, Ledja, and Haouran, but at present there is scarcely anything deserving the name of a town. The fixed inhabitants cultivate the wadis and other spots between the hills with successful industry; the rest of the people are Bedawins, either belonging to, or subject to, the well-known 1 This is the last place of any note given by Ptolemy in Arabia Petrsea. 8 The writer passed the night in a small Bedawin encampment of the AniztSh which was placed in one of these craters; out of this he threaded his way next morning, after about two hours of severe exertion, sometimes crossing and at others endeavouring to follow the circular passages : these formed quite a labyrinth. 8 I saw a tank about 300 yards square, which, from its position, may have been constructed to supply Jerash. 4 G 2596 THE HIJAZ.

As the cities of the Decapolis, those of the Haouran, and, above all, the cavernous and rock- bound capital Petra 1 itself, derived their importance from the commerce passing to and from Egypt, Tyre, Sidon, and the rest of the Mediterranean coast, so many of the villages of Pilgrims are the present day are supported by the pilgrims going to the man^ villages, holy cities; a kind of bazar is held at each halting-place of the caravan, or at least the means are there afforded of purchasing fowls, rice, and provender; the Bedawin also being attracted thither by the hope of gain by sale or plunder. Much of the tract eastward of Wadi Arabah has already been noticed ; 2 for, although forming part of Arabia Petrsea, it is included in the pashalik of Damascus, whose nominal limits jebei Tor only terminate at Jebel Tor Hesma, a high mountain one day Kesma. north of Akabah. 3 The castle at the latter place is situated in a large date plantation, and is an ordinary Turkish square- built work, with strong walls to defend the pass. It is placed a few hundred paces from the sea, at the termination of the Akabah, and its name signifies a cliff or steep declivity. 4 A very little way northward of the entrance of Wadi Akabah Ezion Geber. are the ruins of Ailah, near which was situated Ezion Geber. 5 At the former, or Akabah-Ailah, 6 according to Makrizi, 7 is the commencement of Hijaz, or, as it is also called, Belad-el-He- besch ; 8 a tract which extends south-eastward till it meets the territory of Yemen, at the small port of Hali. 9 The whole coast line is locally called Djar, and the mountainous tract at the eastern side, Nedjd Hijaz. In general this district may be considered barren, having sandy plains towards the sea, and in the interior rocky ridges intermixed with some fertile tracts. 1 El Hadjar, a stony citadel in the mountains of the Thamoudites.—Edrisi, ed.

The first station has some trees, chiefly date plantations, with several wells of sweet water, and at the other there is likewise good water and some pasture ground. South-eastward is the watering station of Selma, and farther, beyond Kal'at Ezlam, that of El Astabel, or Astabel Antar, where the only water is supplied from a few holes dug in the sands of the valley. One station onward is Kal'at-el-Wodjeh or Wedge, where there is good water, and about six miles westward of the castle is the small town of the same name, with an excellent harbour, easy of access, and abundantly supplied by the Billec and Hautemey tribes of Bedawin. 1 The succeeding station south-eastward is Akra, where only offensive water is found after a long march; and the next is El Houra, or Dar-el-Ashreyn, which is the twentieth from Cairo; it has indifferent water, which is a strong ape rient. 2 This is a dry wadi, although containing many trees, and the shrub called arak, of which the pilgrims make a kind of tooth-brush. About 63 miles south-south-eastward of the latter station is Yamboo-el-Bahr, a walled town situated along Town of the northern side of a deep bay, forming a spacious harbour, Yainbo0 - whose anchorage is protected by an island at the entrance, and it is so deep that ships can lie close to the shore. The town is divided into two unequal parts by an inlet flowing into it from the bay; the larger division is properly Yamboo, and the smaller El Kad ; 3 both are enclosed by a wall and towers, comprising an area of almost double the space occupied by the houses, 4 and near the latter are some plantations of mangroves. Yamboo is completely an Arab town, and the houses are worse built than those in any other in the Hijaz; it may, however, be considered as the port of Medina, one-third of the way towards which is the fertile valley of Yamboo-el-Nakhel, or Kara Yamboo, containing the country-houses of the rich inhabitants of the sea-port. 1 Survey by Captain Elwon and Lieutenant Pinching, of the Indiau Navy. 2 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

The soil is fertile, being watered by many wells and running streams, and the tract extends several miles. It is bounded on the west by low mountains, in which are extensive excavations, with sculptured figures. 1 The pil grims' route continues eastward to Hedia, on the borders of the district of Khiebar, 2 whose inhabitants, the Beni Missead, Beni Schakan, and Beni Anaesse, are supposed to be the remains of the Riehabites.

Medina-el-N%, the city of the Prophet, first called Yatreb, is situated on a plain at the foot of the principal chain, and on the border of the Arabian desert; which is here a dead level spreading southward. 3 On the western side of the town the ground is of volcanic rock, and uncultivated; but elsewhere it is surrounded by walled gardens and date plantations, inter mixed with wheat, barley, and clover fields, generally enclosed with mud walls : 4 the ground beyond, within a circle of 12 miles, including Jeb-el-Ayre on the south, Jeb-el-Ohod and Jeb-el-Thor, on the north, is considered sacred. 5 The city itself has nearly the shape of a pear, and at the smaller extre mity there is a respectable castle situated on a rocky eminence; towards the larger end is the great mosque El Harim ; and outside of this part of the city is the burial-ground called El Bekya, which is very extensive. The streets of the city are narrow, dirty and gloomy; but the houses are good, being of stone, well built and generally two stories high ; the place is surrounded by a stone wall, having three gates, and is flanked by some SO towers, with a ditch, which was added by the 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

On the western side of the city is the Monakh, or halting place of the caravans, and beyond are the suburbs ; these consist of summer houses and ordinary build ings, the latter having courts with low apartments round them; which, together with date and other gardens, occupy more space than the city itself. 2 A supply of water is con veyed through the town, by means of a deep kanat coming from the mountain of El Khoba on the southern side ; and in winter time the torrent of Seyl-el-Medina gives an additional supply. 3 Vegetables and various fruits are brought in abun dance from the fine gardens round the village of El Khoba. There are in the city an extensive bath, two fine and several inferior Medressehs, in addition to the Mesjid All, the Mesjid 'Omar in the Monakh, and other inferior mosques in the suburbs, as well as in the city ; but the grand attraction is the Mesjid en' Neby, which was founded by the Prophet himself.

It consisted of a brilliant diamond star suspended immediately above the Prophet's tomb, and various vessels set with jewels; also ear-rings, bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments, which had been sent as presents from all parts of the empire : 2 but notwithstanding this loss the harim is very rich, having property and annuities in almost every part of the sultan's dominions. 3 History of the The mosque was originally a small chapel, surrounded by mosqiie. muc [ walls, which were erected after the flight of Muhammed from Mekkah.

Road to Mek- The road from Medina towards Mekkah, after traversing some rocky ridges south-westward of the former city, gradually descends from the higher plateau, which is nearly on a level with that of Nedjd ; and after passing for seven hours through a succession of rocky valleys, full of winter torrents and thorny trees, it arrives at the plain of Fereysh. From hence it passes the Wadi-es-Shohada, and afterwards the more extensive valley of El Nazye, which is ten miles long and six miles broad ; it is thickly covered with acacia-trees, and bordered by ranges of hills, partly composed of granite and partly of limestone. 4 From hence a wide valley leads to the pass of Jedeyde and 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

On making an incision in the bark the juice issues, and is taken off with the thumb-nail, it is then put into a vessel: the gum is of two kinds, white, which is most esteemed, and yellowish white. 4 Jeb-el-Sobh, the territory of the brave tribe of Sobh, con- jeb-ei-Sobh. tains many fertile valleys, which produce grain in addition to the more valuable commodities just noticed. 5 A few miles north-westward is Bedr, or Beder Honeyn, a Country from small town, enclosed with a mud wall, and celebrated for the t0 Ko1 ' battle fought by Muhammed in the second year of the hijrah. Uneven ground and rocky valleys continue eastward to Bir es Sheikh ; from whence to the Haj station of Kolleya the sur face is either flinty or of cultivable clay, with some sandhills bearing a few trees ; among which is, now and then, a hamlet. 6 Onward it is chiefly sand, with tarfa (tamarisk-trees) and some tamarinds (thamr hindi), and this soil continues as far as Kholeys. The country hereabout is a wide plain, in several parts of which are date groves, together with fields of dhurrah, and other grain, 7 amidst scattered hamlets, of which Es Souk is the principal. This plain merges into another, called El Barka, which, though gravelly and sandy, produces the ashour 8 and acacia, and these trees abound as far as Wadi Fatimah.

The appearance of the city, at other times, is sombre ; no trees or gardens cheer the eye, and there are but few khans, baths, serais, or even mosques. There are but few cisterns for collecting rain; the well Scarcity of water is brackish, and during the pilgrimage sweet water water ' becomes an absolute scarcity. 2 At other times the city is chie-fly supplied by a conduit coming from the vicinity of Arafat, a distance of six hours ; this extensive work was constructed by Zebeyda, wife of Harun-el-Rashid. In the widest part of the valley stands the famous Beit Beit uiiah.

The top of the ka'bah is bare, and opposite the black stone an opening is left in the curtain. The latter is manufactured in Cairo at the expense of the Sultan, and is always of the same form and pattern. On the 25th of the month Zul' Kade the old one is removed, and the ihram ^ (stripping) continues during the absence of the pilgrims at Arafat, or about 15 days. The new kessoua is then displayed, and its colour, shape, and gentle undulations in the midst of a vast square produce a singularly imposing effect. The ka bah itself, as well as the custom of clothing it, appears to be of Pagan origin, and to go back at least to Asad Toba, one of the Himiyarite kings of Yemen. 2 But according to Muham- medan tradition, the structure was raised by the personal labour of Abraham and Isaac; and on the spot which is asserted to have been once occupied by a similar building erected by Adam after his expulsion from Paradise. Opposite the centre of the western side, two slabs of verde antico mark the supposed tombs of Hagar and Isma'el ; 3 and on the same side, about two feet below the summit of the structure, is the Myzeb or water spout, said to be of pure gold. It projects about four feet, and has at the extremity a hanging gilt board, called the Beard of Myzeb, to throw rain water clear of the building. 4 Round the ka'bah there is an oval-shaped marble pavement, enclosed by 32 gilt-poles, and suspended in each of the intervals are seven glass lamps, which are always lighted after sunset. Outside there is a second pavement, about eight paces broad, and rather more elevated; then another, six inches higher, and eighteen inches broad, on which are the five makams or places of prayer. Beyond these are the mambar (pulpit).

Except by its great extent the rest of the structure differs but little from a first-rate mosque: the court is a parallelo gram 250 paces long, by 200 paces broad, with 19 entrances and seven minarehs within the enclosure. The eastern side has four rows of pillars, and the others interior of the only three ; each pillar is rather more than 20 feet high, and court ' from 18 to 23 inches diameter; but they are very irregular, some being of white marble, others of granite or porphyry, and the rest of common Mekkah stone. Every four of these support a small dome, of which there are 154, all plastered and whitewashed outside. Lamps are suspended from the domes as well as in wreaths between the columns; some of them are lighted every night, and the whole during the ramadan. The floors of the colonnades are coarsely paved, and seven causeways, nine inches above the ground, lead from thence to the ka'bah, which, by some strange oversight, is not quite in the centre of the Mesjid-el-Harim; and the whole enclosure is several feet below the level of the surrounding streets. During the service the Imam takes his post near the gate Devotion and of the ka'bah, and his genuflexions being imitated simul- profanatlori ' taneously by 7000 or 8000 persons from various parts of the world, the effect is so striking, especially when the lamps are lighted, that it cannot fail to impress the most indifferent with some kind of awe. At other times boys play in the great square, and porters cross with luggage when it is their nearest route; but what is infinitely worse, the enclosure is often the 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

This last is a considerable town, situated in the midst of a barren country covered with saline earth, and without gardens or vegetation of any kind, except a few date-trees. It is about 1500 paces in length, by half as many in width, and surrounded on the land side by a wall with towers and a ditch. There is a small castle at the southern, and a battery at the opposite extremity of the town, on which there is a piece of ordnance carrying a ball of 500 lbs., whose fame alone is considered a protection to Jiddah. 3 There is a defective port with two small quays, only adapted for the say, the smallest vessel that navigates the Red Sea; those of greater size being obliged to anchor in the roadstead, about two miles from the shore. 4 The best part of the town is a long well-built street of two-storied houses, running parallel to the sea, containing several good khans and lined with shops. The other streets are not paved, though in general they are wide and airy; the huts of the peasants and labourers form part of the town, and the latter presents a complete mixture of Indian, Arabian, and other families, amounting to 12,000 or 15,000 souls. Jiddah is imperfectly supplied with water, partly from cis- 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol. I., p. 215. 8 Ibid., pp. 321, 322. 8 Ibid., p. 15. 4 Ibid., p. 16.CHAP.

Not having any manufactures the inhabitants are either sea- wealth, &amp;c., faring people, or traders by sea as well as to the interior; and of Jiddah - being in some degree the port of India, Egypt, Africa and Arabia, Jiddah is well entitled to its Arabian appellation, which signifies rich. 1 Some merchants possess property to the amount of 200,000/. sterling, and there are at least a dozen mercantile houses, each of which has a capital varying from 40 to 50,000/. sterling. 2 The coffee trade, chiefly from Yemen, and the Indian trade, being the principal branches of commerce. Jiddah is governed by a pasha of three tails, whose authority extends over Sowakin and Massona. The public revenue arises almost exclusively from the customs here called ashour (tithes), which are fixed at 10 per cent., and yield about 400,000 dollars, 3 chiefly from spices and Indian piece- goods, perfumery, &amp;c. The market is well supplied with ghee, meat, fruits, and vegetables. The population is estimated at 40,000 souls, which is at least one-third more than that of the capital. In the interior of the country, two hours east-south-east of Mekkah, is the valley of Muna, in which the pilgrims are enjoined to make a halt; and four hours onward is the well- known plain of Arafat, covered with shrubs and low acacia- trees. Near the centre stands the half-ruined mosque Jami Ibrahim, and two miles northward is the low mountain from which the plain takes its name. This granite hill, which is also called Jeb-el-Rahme (Mountain of Mercy), rises to about Jeb-ei-Rahmc. 200 feet at the north-eastern side of the space; and, though near the mountains encompassing it, it is separated from them by a rocky valley. At the foot of the hill flows the canal of Mekkah, and beyond, for some distance southward and east ward, the scene at times is most animated, having the Egyp tian pilgrims on one side, the Syrian on the other, and beyond, the bazar, with the troops and other attendants of the Pasha. It is so arranged that the Hajl from both parts should 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol. I., p. 29. 2 Ibid., p. 30.. 3 In 1814.—Ibid., p. 94.608 plain of arafat.

The plain spread at the foot of the latter occasionally contains 3000 tents and 25,000 camels. 1 At its eastern extremity is the canal of Mekkah, and near it a small tank, also a cluster of huts called Kahwet Arafat, belonging chiefly to the Beni Koreysh, who cultivate vegeta bles in a valley extending southward. At Kahwet Arafat the road enters the mountains, ascending gradually as far as the wells of Wadi No mar, seven hours and a-half distant. The country is intersected by rocky valleys, producing an abun dance of acacia-trees, and presenting gneiss, quartz, some mica and granite, 2 with red granite at the summit of the ridge called Jeb-el-Kora. On the slope are the huts Kahwet Kora, from whence the camel loads are carried to the summit of the mountain on mules and asses; the loads are again carried onwards by camels, which then descend rather rapidly to Ras-el-Kora. This is the most beautiful spot in the Hijaz, being picturesquely situated amidst granite rocks and large shady trees, interspersed with vines, European fruit-trees and verdant fields, the whole extending from two miles and a-half to three miles east and west, and a mile in width. Ihe Hodheyl tribe are scattered in hamlets over this fine tract, and their houses are well built of stones and mud. Each dwelling contains three or four apartments, which receive no light but from the entrance; they are, however, neat and clean, and their furniture consists of carpets, woollen sacks, wooden bowls, earthen coffee-pots, with a matchlock, which is kept in a leather case. 4 To this succeeds barren ground, and then a steep declivity of sandstone leading into the fertile Wadi Mohram, which is so denominated because it is here that the pilgrims going to Mekkah invest themselves with the ihram or pilgrim's wrapper. 5 The whole chain of mountains ^ 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

Tai'f is in the centre of a Description of sandy plain, about four hours' march in circumference; this Taif ' is overgrown with shrubs, and encompassed by the low moun tains called Jebel Ghazoare.^ The town is an irregular square of about two miles in circumference, surrounded by a wall with towers and a ditch. It has, in addition, a castle occu pying a rocky elevated site at the western side, and forming part of the wall. 4 The houses are mostly small but well built with stone, and have their sitting-rooms on the upper floor. 5 The streets are broader than is usual in the East, and in front of the castle a large open square serves for a market. 6 Taif is supplied by a copious well within, and another without the walls, and is celebrated all over Arabia for its fine air and beautiful gardens, 7 the nearest of which are three quarters of an hour to the S.W.: the others are at the foot of the moun tains, and they produce abundance of roses, fine grapes, figs, quinces, and the other fruits of Jebel Kora. 8 Four hours south-eastward of Tai'f, is Wadi Lye, watered Wadi Lye. by a rivulet, and containing many houses with fine gardens on the borders of the stream. After traversing the moun tains for two hours, from Lye there is a descent into the great plain stretching eastward, on which, at about 12 hours from Taif, stands the small town of Kolakh, built on the most frequented road from Nedjd to Zohran, and the sea-ports of Yemen. 9 At the distance of 18 hours from Kolakh, along the plain on the eastern side of the great range, is Wadi Sobeyh, the first district in Nedjd, and beyond its north- 1 Burckhardt 's Travels in Arabia, vol.

Towns. On the western slope of the chain are the towns of Mok- howa, Shagga, and Doga. The first is a stone-built and large town, with a good market, and is situated in a fertile country; the second is a small place, and the third, which is one day south-eastward from thence, has also a good market, but the houses are constructed only of brushwood and reeds. 1 On the coast, towards the south-east, are the fort of Leet, or Liht, with a small town and harbour formed by the island of Kish- ran. Two days and a half southward is the well-known port of Coomfidah; and again, one day further in the same direc tion, the small harbour of Halli, at the southern limits of the territory of Mekkah and that of the Hijaz. 2 Extent of Yemen, the adjoining province, is at the southern extremity of Arabia, having the Indian Ocean on the south, the Red Sea on the west, the Hijaz on the north, and on the east the desert of Ahkaf, with part of the province of Hadramaut, and it contains a superficies amounting to nearly 68,700 square miles.

This district has few permanent streams, yet it contains several towns and 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol. II., pp. 388, 389. 8 Ibid. 3 Ibid.CHAP.

Parallel to the latter are Districts of many islands of small note, and at short intervals between Te ^ me ^* these, a multitude of coral reefs and islets. At the northern extremity of this low country is the tract extending from the slope of Jebel Beni Said to the sea, and again from the bor ders of the Hijaz, south-eastward, to those of Abu Arisch. Towards the northern extremity, are Jafofe, Ernege, and Nahood ; in the centre, Dubban and El Wussim; and on the south, Widin and Makerah. The district of Abu Arisch forms the continuation of the am Arisch. former, and is a narrow strip between 17° 40' N.L., and Te- hameh Proper, in 15° 52' N.L., extending eastward from the sea till it touches the chain of mountains towards the southern extremity, and at the other meets the district of Khaulan. The latter is situated at the foot of the chain which here forms a kind of amphitheatre, and it is the second of this name, the other being near Sana; but the tract itself is little known. Towards the north of Abu Arisch are Attaid-Sebt, Darb-Niab, and Sancan ; towards the south are Bedoni, Har- rad, and Bahas ; and in the centre the town and harbour of Gezan, or Jozan, with some salt springs in the vicinity. This place has a considerable trade in senna, and it is surrounded by flourishing villages, with all kinds of fruits. 1 Opposite to it is the island of Farsan, containing the grotto of pearls. A little way from Jozan is the district of Sabayah, containing the town of Selameh; and less than two days from thence is the capital, a walled town, and the seat of a sherif. 2 The Beni Halal Bedawins are the dominant tribe; they live in tents, are poor, and addicted to robbery. 3 The remainder of the plain country is Tehameh Proper, TeMmeh which stretches south-eastward of Abu Arisch from the Proper ' mountains to the sea, as far as the chain bordering^ the north ern side of the district of Aden. Towards the northern limits is Lohayah, a kasabah 4 containing chiefly herdsmen, and only defended by a few towers. Several houses are of stone, 1 Arabic Geo. MS., translated/by A.

It contains a small town and an excellent harbour, in which vessels proceeding from India to Jiddah usually get wood and water, with refreshments. 3 A parched barren country, scantily supplied with water, prevails to the southward as far as Hodeida, containing at intervals large villages, in one of which there is a tannery, in another a pottery, and in a third indigo is prepared. 4 The town is situated at the north-eastern side of a sandy bay, where it is sheltered by a point of land running N.W.; the harbour of Hodeida is, in consequence, superior to that of Lohayah, and it is defended by a small citadel, situated near the sea. The houses of the merchants, as well as those of the principal Arabs, are of stone, but the rest of the town is composed of huts built of mud and straw. It is under a dola, whose rank and authority correspond with those of a pasha in Turkey; and the revenue is raised by duties levied on the export of coffee from Be'it-el-Fakih, which is the chief port. 5 The latter city is situated about 35 miles to the south-east; and on the road thither are a number of coffee huts, but very few villages. The city is large, and the most considerable coffee-mart in Arabia, being only half a day s journey from the hills, where it is chiefly grown, and also at a moderate distance from the harbours of Lohayah and Mokha. The town, which is ■ distinguished as Bei't-el-Fakih-el-Kebir, is situated in a naturally infertile, but now carefully cultivated plain. A citadel occupies the centre, around which is the town, consisting of detached buildings of stone; many of these have, however, become uninhabitable, owing to the ravages of a species of white ant, called ard by the Arabs. 6 1 Niehbuhr's Travels in Arabia, vol.

The city is close to one of the finest and best-watered valleys in the district; but although interesting from its aqueduct, its numerous mosques, kubbets, &amp;c., it has little more than the shadow of the splendor which, as a royal residence, it once possessed.

This tract extends along the crest and both slopes, but chiefly the eastern side of the great chain which traverses the country in a south-easterly direction, and it comprises the best part of Arabia Felix. The epithet Happy was derived from its climate and fertility, and its abundance of corn, vines, cattle, and spices. It has also wholesome water and warm springs, numerous brooks, and an agreeable temperature. Its kings have splendid residences, and the condition of the people indi cates that they live in a state of comfort. 2 Sets' 0f mountains separated by deep valleys, with small plains occasionally intervening, cause this part of Arabia not only to be naturally divided into provinces, but also broken into a number of petty states, each under an almost independent local government. These tracts, which elsewhere in Arabia are generally designated Nahuet (district), in Yemen take the name of Mikhlaf: there are seventy-four of them, in addition to eight principal divisions. 3 Asir. A sir, one of the latter, forms the northern termination of the province, and is of considerable extent, stretching from the great range here called Jebel Beni Said, eastward to the frontiers of El Ahkaf, and from the borders of Hijaz south ward to the smaller districts of Senhan and Abybda. This mountainous country contains several tribes, of which the principal are the brave Asir; it contains also the villages of Asir, Shekrateyn, Ed-dahye, Shohata, Ed Djof, and others. 4 1 Niehbuhr's Travels in Arabia, vol.

Two caravan routes lead from Aden into the interior : one passes along the eastern slopes of the mountains by San'a, the other crosses one part of the chain, and, after sending a branch to Mokha, it proceeds northward through Tehameh. Both take a north-westerly direction for about 18 miles to Lahaj, a dirty town, situated in a plain, which produces much grain and a variety of fruits. This place contains the palace of the sultan of the Abdale Arabs, and about 5,000 inhabitants, of whom some are Jews and a few San'alis.

From Abb the road inclines north-westward along the slopes of the mountains to the town of Mechader, which is on a hill, and the seat of a dola; and from hence it leads to Yerim, a moderate sized Makhlaf, with a town of the same name, situated on the northern slope of Jebel Sumara, a higher mountain than Mharres. 1 Some miles onward, in the previous direction, is Damar, or Demar, a small town, thinly peopled, once the seat of the Himyarites. The town and its castle are most agreeably situated on a mount; the former is well watered and abundantly supplied. It is under the super intendence of a dola, and has a famous school, in addition to 5000 well-built houses. 2 On the mountain north of the town are the mosque and Maad-be-jebei. gardens of Maad-be-Jebel, where the learned men assemble; and one day from thence are the ruins of an extensive build ing, with 66 columns below, and 64 columns above (probably part of an aqueduct), called the throne of Balkis. 3 To the N.E. is the mountain of Hirran, which is celebrated for its cornelians, and another, which contains a mine of native sulphur.

This is a small district, with a considerable town of the same name, which, according to tradition, was founded by the Ayyubites. 2 It is situated in Wadi-el-Jend, a cultivated tract, surrounded by high hills, and has a fine mosque, built by Melik Afdhal, with a medresseh called Mojahidiyeh, established by Ibn Mansur, and two others by 'Omar Ben Mansur; one of these, called Eshrefie, has a library which is said to contain 100,000 volumes. The town is walled, and the strong castle of 'Orus occupies a high hill a little way to the N.W. 3 The distance from Ta'ez to Mokha rather exceeds two days, whilst that to Zebia exceeds three, the road running through a cultivated country, 4 and passing, about midway, Mushij, or Maushij, a fine village with a large mosque, and celebrated for many thickets of yasmin (jessamine), within each of which is a well District of 0 f p Ure water. 5 The district is called Ossab, of which the Ossab. r . . . , fortress of He'is, situated m a deep ravine, eighteen miles to the N.N.E. is the capital, and the residence of the sheikh. 6 From the latter place the caravan route proceeds through Zebid and Be'it-el-Fakih, preserving a north-western direc tion through Tehameh and along the coast of Mekkah, whilst the route to San'a proceeds north-eastward over a difficult country.

Onward is the village of Sarnfur, on the slope the di8trict - of Jebel Harran, with the coffee plantations of D6rah and Moihak; the latter is a village containing 50 huts and a khan or simserah, near the crest of the mountains overlook ing San a. This tract contains fine valleys and undulating ground, enclosed by rugged hills, and mountains rising to 1500 feet above the plain. It produces wheat, barley, jowari, fruits, indigo and coffee. The coffee plantations are usually small spots of a square shape, enclosed by a wall to prevent the soil from being washed away. The plant flourishes most in a moist soil, in which it rises to the height of 12 feet. The bean is gathered twice a year, and the two crops yield about 10 lbs. for each tree ; 2 the coffee is of seven different quali ties, viz., Scheridji (the best), Ordemi, Mattari, Harrasi, Hab- bat, Haimi, and Shirazi. 3 Connected with these productive farms, there are numerous khans, here called simserah, 4 which have the double object of affording accommodation and being places of trade. From Mofhak the bridle-road passes Suk-el-Kahmis, the Country from village of Bowan, and the hamlet of Yazil, and continues to S8fir Udhein t0 El Hudhein. From the last village there is a gradual ascent to the crest of the chain, where the hills form an immense circle, studded with castles on the peaks, and numerous small hamlets, with a small white mosque to each, on the sides: the hills here are cut into terraces from top to bottom. Beyond this natural amphitheatre a barren stony table-land extends by the village of Motteneh to that of Assur, which is situated at its eastern verge, overlooking the capital and its beautiful valley. The latter contracts at its northern and southern extremities into an ordinary wadi, that of Tank-el- Yemen being its continuation towards the south. On the west it is bounded by the table-land of Assur and Luluwah 1 Mr. Cruttenden, vol. VIIL, p. 273, of the Royal Geographical Journal. 2 Ibid., pp. 278, 279. 3 Hammer Purgstall, art.

The latter is richly wooded and covered with villages, and it abounds in streams which supply the city. The other mountain is famous for its iron, and on its summit, at an elevation of 1500 feet above the plain, are the ruins of the castle of Ghamdan, which is ascribed to Shem, 1 and to which there is an ascent by means of 1600 steps, city of San'i, At the foot of the mountain is the city of San a itself, with the suburb of Bir-el-Assab adjoining it on the eastern side. Both are surrounded by walls, and towers, and, including the gardens, which almost always form part of an eastern city, the circumference is five miles and a-half. The city is defended here and there by a few old guns in a bad condition. Baths. There are seven gates and 20 mosques, and many of the latter are very handsome, displaying gilt domes; the baths also are good, and are much frequented by the merchants, who discuss there the state of the coffee trade, over a hukkah and a cup of kahwe, or keshr, a beverage prepared from the roasted husks of coffee beans, and tasting like tea. 2 Population, The better description of houses in Sana are of stone, and those of the inferior people of burnt bricks. The principal street has a handsome bridge in the centre, and a considerable volume of water passes down it during the rainy season ; but the other streets are narrow. The population numbers about 40,000 persons, including 3000 Jewish artisans. The modern citadel is at the eastern side of the city, near the site of the ancient structure, and it contains two palaces. Palaces. Adjoining the city are two large palaces belonging to the imam, both built in the Saracenic style, with extensive gar dens adjoining, and enclosed so as to be defensible ; the larger is called Bustan-el-Sultan, and the smaller, which is the most ancient, Bustan-el-Metwokkil. 3 In the valley, about two miles and a-half N.N.W. of the 1 Notes from Seifotistan, in Johannsen's History of Yemen, p. 104; also MS. 7496, fol. 10, in the British Museum. 2 Niehbuhr's Travels in Arabia, vol.

Five miles westward is Wadi Dhar, another town, surrounded by gardens and vineyards, which produce excellent grapes. In the latter, the vines, like those in the north of Italy, are trained over trellis-work, four feet above the ground. Including these three places, the population of San'a approaches 70,000 per sons. 1 An aqueduct and the ruins of the castles and palaces already mentioned, are the only remains of the ancient city, which, like the modern, was deservedly celebrated for its delightful situation, 2 its pure air, and for the little difference between the temperature of summer and winter. 3 The principal manufactures of San'a are the wares formed of the famous steel of Nakam, and striped or other stuffs called Beda and Sareh, which are used for turbans, dresses, &amp;c.; also articles of the fine white and yellow leather called cordovan in Eu rope. 4 The title of imam dates from the time of Suleiman the Magnificent, or about 310 years ago, 5 that of sultan having been assumed by the chief a little previously to the establishment of the Wahabi power. The military force of the imam, in the time of Niehbuhr, consisted of about 4000 infantry and 1000 cavalry. 6 The city, which at one time was called Esal, or 'Osal, 7 was Salubrity of founded by San a Ben Zal Ben Aber, and it once contained 1 e Clty ' the palace of Yahsab the Himyarite and the idol Ghamaden; the latter was placed over a well, whose water was used for purification at the new year. 8 On account of its salubrity, and the abundance and cheapness of the supplies, San a has long been the favourite resort of the sick. 1 Mr. Cruttenden, LN., vol.

The adjoining tract, called Belad»-el-J6f, extends from Nejran on the north, to Jaffea on the south, and from the borders of Yemen on the west, to El Ahkaf on the east; and besides Nedjan and some inferior places, it contains two remarkable cities; one of them, called Mareb, is on the site of the ancient capital, 1 and in its vicinity was the territory called Ard-es- Saba, the land of Sheba. 8 Mareb. Mareb is two days eastward of San'a, and so fertile is the surrounding country, that corn is sown and reaped there three times in the year. 3 The town is situated in a valley, on which another, a day's journey in length, terminates. The latter is enclosed by two ranges of hills which, at the eastern extre mity, approach so nearly that the interval was closed arti ficially, and the remains of the bund called Sitt-e-Mareb are said to be still visible. This celebrated dike 4 appears to have been a huge mass of masonry, such as we see at Oedipore and other places in India, crossing at a great elevation from side to side of a deep mountain valley. The valley at Mareb is filled during the rains; and at other times the water retained in it is fed by six or seven streams which meet there. 5 At the time when the bund failed, the body of water discharged was sufficient to produce what was called the inundation of Aram. In the vicinity of this place are the ruins of two castles, the one said to have been the work of Solomon, and the other of his queen (Balkis). city of Saba. The other city, called Saba, and supposed to be on the site of Sabe Regia, 6 is seated upon a mountain, where the air is considered to be so salubrious that the place is not exposed to any kind of disease; it is also supposed to be free from ser pents and vermin. Moreover, it is believed that idiots on coming thither recover their reason; and many other advan- equally marvellous are ascribed to the place. The 1 Arabic Geo.

The surface, as the name implies, is elevated, but it is diversified with mountains, valleys, and plains. The latter are celebrated throughout Arabia for their excellent pastures, which abound even in the deserts after rain ; and that the country in general is not by any means the barren desert which it has been hitherto represented to be is sufficiently evi dent from the fact that a contest has been carried on for several 1 Some writers consider the mountainous district Nedjd 'Aridh as a separate province. 2 Jomard estimates the distance in a straight line between the two gulfs at 270 leagues. 8 Jihdn Numa, p. 528.CHAP.

Mountains of which traverses the centre of the territory from N.E. to S.W. the P rovince = The range called Jeb-el-Tueyk runs from the former extremity in a north-westerly direction; beyond this is Jeb-el-Shammar, with the elevated peaks of Aja, or Edja, and Solma; and westward are the mountains of El Kassym and Jeb-el-Tai. The wadis and streams are proportionably numerous. Except along the routes of M. Reinan and Captain Sadleir in the central parts, the interior and the subdivisions of this extensive tract are but partially known. At the north-western extremity of the territory is the coun- Principal town try of Jof, or J6f-es-Syrhan, the hollow or low country, which ()f the district ' contains a cluster of seven or eight villages, at about ten minutes' distance from one another, and each is denominated Suk, or market. Dournet-el-Joudol is the principal place, and it has the castle of Sebeki-Kara on the east; Teima is the second, and this also has a castle. The houses are of sun- dried bricks, roofed with palm or date branches, and each suk is surrounded by a garden of palms, locally called houta. Each garden contains a deep well, from which the water is raised by camels. Some wheat is cultivated in this district, which contains the river Baai'rad and two remarkable springs, one called Ai'n-el-Temer, or the fountain of dates, and the other issuing from a block of marble. 2 The inhabitants of this tract make boots, sword-hilts, horse shoes, lance-heads, &amp;c., which, as well as their dates, they sell to the other Arabs. There is an ancient and lofty tower Ancient tower, rising in steps like a pyramid from a square base, till it ends almost in a point; it has three floors and as many flights of steps leading from one to the other. Three hours S.E. from hence commences the sandy plain of Edd-hahi, covered with coarse grass and a tree called ghada, in which are wild dogs and cows, the latter resembling the domestic animal. 3 1 Ibrdhim Pdsha was eight months before Der'ayyah.—Captain Sadleir, Bombay Lit.

Five days south-eastward of Jof begins Jeb-el-Sliammar, another district, extending one degree in latitude, and nearly two degrees in longitude. It is traversed with some difficulty, owing to its forests and mountains; the latter of which have been compared to the Lebanon. 1 The principal peaks are Mount Solma, Mount Aja, or Edja, and Mount Aujan. The first derives its name from a wise woman, and the second from a man so called. They contain the tribe of Beni Thai, and are situated in the centre of the territory, between the towns of Hail and Faid. 2 The last is said to derive its name from Faid, a son of Ham ; it is walled, and has a castle with an iron gate, also a granary to contain wheat and other produc tions. Towards the northern side of the district is the mountain called Ranel Dhah, with the castle of Sabzah at its foot. In the neighbourhood is the fortress of Dumat-el- Jaudal, which is said to have belonged to the Himyarites; and one day from thence is the castle called Kara Shokaik : elsewhere there are other castles, which have been built of white stone. 3 The principal places, in addition to those already mentioned, are Sir, near Mount Aja, with its numerous troglodyte habi tations, Kofar Mastadjeade, Milkian-el-Rum, inhabited by Greeks, and Kahfa. One of these, possibly the first, repre sents the Zamotaso of Ptolemy. 4 The population must be considerable, since the Beni Shammar, the principal tribe, can muster 7000 matchlocks. 5 One day farther to the south-east commences the district of El Sedeir, a quadrangular tract, extending from Jeb-el- Tueyk about If 0 of latitude and 1^° of longitude. It con tains many small places, such as El Zelfy, Harmeh, El Tueym, and El Medjmah, to the north; Djeladjel in the centre; and southward.

Forests of the latter, interspersed with cultivated fields, prevail throughout this district. 1 About 50 miles S.W. is El Kassym, a tract producing also palm andEiKa^ym. fruit trees, but chiefly covered with heath. It extends more than one degree of latitude, and upwards of two degrees of longitude. Near the northern side are Rowar, El Shoubak, El Tannoumah, and El Helalyeh. On the western side, where it is chiefly desert, are the wells of Uddas and Bir All; to the south, Boureydeh and Batah-el-Nebanyeh; towards the east is El Khabb, and towards the centre. El Rass, whose inhabitants claim descent from the Beni Yam of Nejran. Anizeh is the chief place. This town is situated in a valley ? plentifully supplied with water; it is extensive, well built, and is considered beautiful. 2 It appears to be of much com- Commerce of mercial importance, being in the heart of Arabia, and the Aniz ® h ' centre of the caravan trade to Damascus, Baghdad, Basrah, Grane, Khatif, El Ah'sa, and Der'ayyah, that is, towards the Persian Gulf on one side, and the Red Sea, through Medina and Mekkah, on the other. Merchants, chiefly from the Gulf, assemble at this place, bringing Indian rice and goods to the bazars. 3 The fort was rased and the town much dilapidated when taken by Ibrahim Pasha. Wadi Sarr connects this district with that of Teza'at, Wad! Sam which is also called El Woschem, from a valley and elevated mountain of this name. 4 It lies to the south-east and has the shape of a long triangle, whose apex is in the latter direction, the eastern side being formed by Jeb-el-Tueyk. Near the south-western angle are Bessam, El Forrah, and Uscheyker; at the north-western side are Ain-el-Sir and El Horayb; at the south-eastern side, the plain of Hussiah, the village of Dorama, the wells of Aoorez, and those of Surmudda. In a flat gravelly desert, and nearly in the centre is Shakra, a town which for eight days resisted Ibrahim Pasha, who, in consequence, rased its walls. It contains a good mosque and a market-place, and is surrounded by date-groves, plantations 1 Jihan Numa, p. 52'7. 2 Arabic Geo. MS., &amp;c. - 3 Captain Sadleir, Bombay Literary Society, vol.

South-eastward is the dis- District of trict of Yemameh, with a wadi of the same name, which is con sidered as the garden of Arabia. The wadi is situated at the south-eastern limits of the province, and it contains four streams, viz., Judah,Hajar, Nahr Sheikh-el-Ghanun, and Nahr Sheikh en Ne'am, which have their springs in the Jeb-el-Ram; it has also many fountains, of which the most celebrated are Ain Hadhra, Ai'n Hai't, and Ain Ram. 2 This district contains many villages watered by kanats, and it is very productive in wheat, the sugar-cane, and dates of peculiar sweetness, with other fruits. The name of the district, as well as that of the principal town, anciently Jaw, or Jauva, was derived from the brilliant eyes of Yemameh, niece of Tasim, 3 a descendant of Amelek-ben-Hascha. The Beni Jedis tribe also at one time inhabited this part of the country, but a chief having exacted a signorial claim on the occasion of a marriage, a war broke out, in which one of the tribes was nearly exterminated. A Destruction of noble named Rebah-ben-Mere, however, escaped to Yemen, two tribes. , • t v and, alter a time, returned with an army under Hasam-ben- Tobai, king of the Himyarites. By the_ aid of this force he surprised and destroyed the opposite tribe, and thus both became extinct. The territory, as well as the borders of El Hajar, once the seat of the Beni 'Aad, was subsequently occu pied by the Beni Hanifa, and a part of the Modhar tribes The Tasim are said, in ancient times, to have worshipped an idol made of honey and butter, which they were accustomed to eat when hungry. 4 Wadi-el-Khardj forms the northern limits of the district, 1 Captain Sadleir, Bombay Literary Society, vol.

The town contains 2000 houses, many of which are well built and of two stories. In this district there are, it is understood, about 300 villages. 3 Ten miles north-westward, seated in a narrow valley on the Description of south-western side of the chain of Jeb-el-'Aridh, is the capital, Der ' a y yah - which is watered by an abundant stream, and agreeably situated amidst date plantations and gardens producing apri cots, figs, grapes, pomegranates, citrons, and other fruits. Der'ayyah is composed of five small towns or villages, forming two principal divisions, the eastern portion, called Selle, being on one side of the deep ravinet and Tarifa, the western, on the other, the whole is enclosed by a wall and towers. Before the destructive siege by Ibrahim Pasha the town contained 28 mosques, 30 medressehs, and about 2500 houses, gene rally good, some of brick, others of stone, and its population exceeded 15,000 souls. 5 The Wadi Beni Hanifah, that of the capital, is strong, having but two approaches, the one at El Ayemeh on the west, and the other on the east of Der'ayyah. 6 Yemameh and the chain of Jeb-el-'Aridh, together with Nedjd 'Aridh. Waschem and the other districts already noticed, stretching to the N. W. as far as Jeb-el-Shammar, constitute the extensive district of Nedjd Aridh, or the mountainous part of Nedjd. 1 Abu-l-fedd, in M.

The district of El Haryk, which is one day and a-half south -eastward of Yemameh, is about 90 miles from east to west, and nearly 40 from north to south, and at the latter extremity it touches Rhoha-el-Khali. It contains Naim, El Hebrah, El Malka, El Hulah, and El Haryke, the principal place ; but the tract itself is almost unknown. Near the south-western extremity of Nedjd, on the borders of Hijaz, is the tract called El Bakarra; southward of this is Wadi Taslys, and again, a little farther, Wadi Sobeyh, a district extending for about 80 miles along the eastern side of the great chain, with a breadth of about 20 miles. It con tains, near its south-eastern limits, the towns of Ranyeh and Tabala', and, almost at the north-western extremity, that of Taraba. The latter is a considerable place, as large as Tai'f, and remarkable for the abundance of its dates. The town is walled, flanked with towers, and situated in the midst of well- watered palm groves and gardens, at the northern extremity of Wadi Sobeyh. 1 Eastward and north-eastward, from its borders to those of Rhoba-el-Khali, is the fertile district of Scheran, extending, in an oval shape, north and south. Towards the latter extre mity is Wadi Scheran, a spacious valley, with many branches falling into it and, at the opposite is Bische, the capital, of The town is defended by a strong castle situated in a broad valley of the same name, which extends six or eight hours, and abounds with rivulets, wells and gardens. Being on the principal route between Nedjd and Yemen, Bische is con sidered to be the military key of the latter province.

The Dowaser Arabs are described as being very tall, and almost a black race: they live here m winter, and remove to more fertile pastures during the summer. Next to these are the Beni Kelb, whose language is so barbarous that it has been compared to the barking of dogs. 1 El Afladj, the last district to be noticed, lies immediately ei Afladi north-eastward of Wadi Dowaser, and is of an oval shape. It contains Mescheylleh, El Anegley, El Ghoal, El Kharfeh, Starah, Hararah, Leyle, and El Bedey; but, like the former district, it is scarcely known. Onward is the principal desert of Nedjd, which extends Principal north-eastward nearly 5° by upwards of 3° in width from the de8ert ' south-eastern to the north-western side, where it is bounded by Jeb-el-Aridh. This portion of Arabia has long been con sidered a mere sandy waste, only watered from the clouds ; but recent accounts show that it is not quite so desolate; and it is at least partially inhabited. In summer time it is wholly deserted, being without wells; but in winter, after rains, when the sands produce herbage, all the great tribes of Nedjd, Hijaz, and Yemen, pasture their flocks in parts of this desert, bordering respectively on their own countries. 2 Nedjd is the original seat, as well as the present centre, of the Wahhabi power; and to the firmness of this people in maintaining their new religion, as well as to their gallant defence of their country, against the inroads of the Pasha of Egypt, we are indebted for the little knowledge that has been recently gained of the state of the province. This is derived from the observations made by Monsieur Mengin, who served in Ibrahim Pasha's army; also from Captain Sadleir's journey, and that of M. Reinan, which was made long before. One of the principal routes is from El Khatif, in a west- Routes, south-westerly direction to Der'ayyah, and another lies more southward: this was followed by Captain Sadleir, from El Hassa by Amer-Robbia and Manfouah to the same city. From this there is a caravan route to Mekkah, keeping S.W. along the slopes of Jeb-el-Aridh; and passing by Soda, Kar- 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

Another proceeds from Der'ayyah, N.W. by Shakra to the commercial town of Anizeh, from whence there are four principal lines, on all of which the communications are more or less active. The first proceeds northward to Jeb-el-Shammar, from whence there are three branches: one by Syneh to the river Euphrates, another direct towards Meshed All, Baghdad, &amp;c., and the third north-westward, through J of, to Damascus and Syria. A second line, which is largely used by pilgrims, proceeds from Aniz6h by El Rass, Dat, Wadi-el-Miah, Jebel-el-Mawyeh and El Henakyeh; from whence, instead of continuing in a westerly direction, its course is a little west of south to Medinah; and from the latter place, either by the grand route to Mekkah, or for the accommodation of merchandise, south-westward through Yambo-el-Nakhel, to the coast. Adjoining Nedjd to the southward, and forming the conti nuation of Rhoba-el-Khali, is another tract, said to be of a similar description; and the district of El Ahkaf, which some geographers include in Yemen: but the Turkish authors 1 con sider it to be a distinct province. Boundaries of El Ahkaf covers a large portion of southern Arabia, having El Ahkaf. Arabia Felix on the west, Hadramaut on the south, 'Oman on the east, and Nedjd to the north. It has been supposed to be entirely without inhabitants, and owing to its sterility alto gether impassable ; 2 this, however, can scarcely be the case, since one of the khaliphs 3 raised a considerable body of troops in this part of Arabia. Edrisi speaks of its sandy wastes, adding that there are few inhabitants, and but little com merce. 4 Recently a lake has been discovered in the interior, 1 Chapter on Arabia in the Jihan Numa; translated by Dr. Sprenger. 2 Ahkdf is one of the most dreary regions on the face of the earth.

It is now independent of the Imam of San a, being governed by three princes, viz., the Sultan of Rasses, who resides at Medjeba, the Sultan of Mosaka, who lives at a place of the same name, and the Sultan of Kara, who resides in a castle upon the mountain of Kara. Beldd Schafel, and Belad- el-Dahla, belong to the two sheikhs of those places. Shugra, Sughra. properly Sughra, the principal port, is now a village of 200 persons, with a roughly-built castle, which for some months in the year is the residence of the sultan. 2 Thirty-six hours N.W. of Sughra, Wadi Bahrein winds through the moun tains. The numerous streams of this valley flow into an extensive lake of the same name; and Mein, which has 1500 souls, is the largest village in the district. 3 About 65 miles to the eastward of Sughra is Kandha, near Kaudha.

The |own extends about a mile along-shore and is of a triangular shape; it contains a mosque, a custom house, and about 6000 inhabitants.

Six towers have been constructed for the protection of the place; behind which Jeb-el-Gharrah rises 1300 feet above the sea. The inhabitants consist of the Beni Hasan, the Yafa'i and Karachie tribes, with some Banians and other foreigners, in all amounting to about 4500 souls; they have some remains of the ancient trade to India: gums, hides, coffee, and large quantities of senna, being exported from thence in return for cotton, cloths, lead, iron, crockery, rice, dates, sheep, honey, aloes, frankincense and other spices, and also some slaves; 5 there is besides a considerable coasting trade. 6 The route from this port to Sihun, now the capital of Hadramaut, is by Tukam, Jeb-el-Akar, Wasel, Kaidah, a considerable place, Sa ah, Abd- al-Beti and Tarbal. 7 In this district and the bordering tract of Ahkaf tradition 1 Royal Geographical Journal, vol, IX., p. 151. 2 Edrisi, ed.

Only a small part is washed by the Persian Gulf; the rest is on the ocean, which being usually much agitated is called Bahr 'Oman, or the Swelling Sea.

The intervening space, in a line running north-west ward to the Persian Gulf, is a desert tract, merging into that of El Ahkaf; the distance to the latter nowhere exceeding 150 miles from the sea. In addition to what has been collected by other individuals, the recent travels of Lieut. Wellsted, of the Indian navy, have made us well acquainted with a considerable portion of the interior of this interesting province. Here the mountain chain, already noticed as almost encir cling Arabia, becomes very marked. Under the name of Jeb- el-Felluh it runs almost parallel to the coast from the neigh bourhood'of Ras-el-Hadd, till it makes a south-western sweep opposite Maskat, where it is chiefly mica slate, from 1000 feet to 2000 feet high. 2 Soon afterwards it resumes a direction jeb-ei-Akhdar. parallel to the sea, under the name of Jeb-el-Akhdar, or the green mountains.

But on the whole the effect is good and striking, as the houses rise in ter races along the rocky slopes, whose dark, craggy and frowning summits are crowned with forts connected by crenellated walls, supported by numerous batteries defending the harbour. Seated in another cove a little way to the N.W. is Muttra, Muttra. or Matarah, which is a considerable town, almost entirely a place of business, and containing more well-built houses than Maskat. At intervals of a mile, or a mile and a half, there are three other coves: the first called Kalehat, with a village dependent upon Matarah ; the two others also have each a vil-' lage; and all the three villages are about the same size. The decided encouragement given to trade by the present distin guished and liberal imam has peopled the town with a mixed race, descended from Arabs, Persians, Kurds, Syrians, Indians, Afghans and Baluches, in all about 60,000 souls, who have become acclimatized in a place which is almost invariably fatal to Europeans. 1 The inhabitants manufacture sugar, ulwah, some cloaks and coarse cloths ; but commercial pursuits are the principal occupations. 2 The chief exports are dates, madder, 3 sharks' fins (sent to China), and salt fish, which are 1 The thermometer stood at 106° in the shade at 5 p.m ., 10th April.

Here the coast becomes exceedingly wild and bold, presenting as far as. Cape Musendom a rugged chain of mountains, rising abruptly from the sea to the average height of 2500 feet, without having any beach except a little coral, and only an occasional valley striking inwards. These show some date-trees along the rivulets, but scarcely any cultivation ; 3 which is also the case throughout the mountainous tract stretch ing from thence to the western shore.

This, which is also called the pirate-coast, commences with Pirate coast, the port and town of Ser, the capital of the small district of Belad-Ser, in the vicinity of Cape Musendom ; from whence it extends, by Ras-el-Khaimah, south-westward to the bay of Bahrein, a distance of 350 miles.

The principal tribes are the Jawasimi, the Menasir, Beni As, and Mahama, who number IQ^SO 1 males, and have at least 1500 vessels, varying in size from 10 to 400 tons, with which, dur- piiacy ing the intervals between the pearl seasons, they at one time practised, infested the southern frontier of Arabia and the northern shores of India, generally putting to death the crews of vessels which fell into their hands. The existence, in the fourth cen tury of the Hijra, of pirates carrying on their depredations systematically, not only along the coast, but often far out at sea, is mentioned by Ibn Haukal, 2 and also by Edrisi. 3 But in later times this evil became more formidable, by the union of the piratical tribes with a part of the Wahhabi people; the latter transferring their hostility to mankind, from the deserts to the ocean surrounding them. This state of things conti nued till the stronghold of Ras-el-Khaimah (Cape Tent) was captured and rased to the ground in 1819. The port then contained 63 large vessels and many smaller; but since the treaty made at that time with the Jawasimi by Major-General Sir Keir Grant, Abuthabbee, about 120 miles to the south west, has been their principal seat. The Company's cruisers in the gulf have, however, been sufficient to keep down their latent but strong predilection for their old occupation.

The shores about it are very low, and it is surrounded by shoals, which are partly dry at low water. A range of moderately high hills runs through the centre of the island, which is fertile and has numerous springs of good water, with plantations chiefly of date-trees; but it is only partially cultivated. There are on the island 15 villages of various sizes, and two towns. Ruffin, the smaller of these, is built round a fort on the ruins of a former town, and it is situated on a hill seven miles southward of the capital. Manama, the chief town, and the most respectable in the Town of Persian Gulf, is at the north-eastern extremity of the island; it contains good buildings, a well supplied bazar, and about 40,000 inhabitants. Independently of from 2500 to 3000 small craft belonging to the pearl fishery, there are upwards of 140 vessels, of various sizes, employed in trading. To the north of Manama there is a good harbour, which is however exposed to north-west winds; and there is one smaller and safer to the south-east: both of them are partly formed by the island of Arad.

The latter consists of five divers and five pullers to each boat, of which there are at Bahrein alone about 1500; and there are Seasons for about as many more elsewhere. There are two seasons for col lecting the oysters; the first, which is short and cold, is in June, when diving is practised only in the shallow water along the coast; but it is not before the intense heat prevailing from July to the middle of September, when the water is as warm as the air, that this trying occupation can be pursued without causing intense suffering from the cold. The diver is provided with a net tied round his waist to contain the oysters, then his ears being stuffed with bees' wax, and his nostrils compressed with Manner of a piece of horn, he is lowered into the water, the descent being facilitated by means of a cord with a heavy stone at the extre mity ; on this he stands, holding the rope, and after working hard for a period which probably averages less than two minutes, he shakes a cord attached to the boat as a signal to be drawn up; but his stay under water frequently does not exceed 35 or 40 seconds. The operation takes place on an empty stomach, and under favourable circumstances as to temperature; the task is repeated 12 or 15 times in a day, without being consi dered injurious to the constitution. 1 Some precaution is, how ever, necessary, and when the diver is overcome by fatigue he must abstain from food, till he has been refreshed by sleep; but notwithstanding all his bodily exertion, a favourable season seldom gives him more than a clear profit of from 30 to 50 Spanish dollars^. The pearl-fishery has rather declined of late years, but the produce is still considerable ; 8 two-thirds of it, when taken out of the shells and dried, belong to the mer chants at Bahrein ; the pearls are sized by sifting them. ^ Colonel Wilson, in the Royal Geographical Journal, vol.

The north-western extremity of Bahrein is barely 10 miles from the Arabian coast, and there intervenes, but nearer to Bahrein than to the coast, an uninhabited island, called Jeb- el-Hussein. An extensive flat, called Teignmouth Shoal, extends at least 10 miles northward of Bahrein; and some miles farther towards the north-west is the Island of Tirhoot, or Taroot, which is 10 miles long from N.W. to S.E.; it is well watered and thickly covered with date groves ; l and on the mainland, just opposite, is El Khatif. This is the prin- Town of ei cipal town of the district of the same name; it is situated on low ground amidst gardens, and contains some good houses, which are surrounded by walls and defended by a citadel. The population is about 6000 souls; to which Yebrin and the 15 other surrounding villages give an addition of 19,000 souls. 8 There is some trade with India, particularly with Surat, but the principal commerce is with Bahrein. The district pro duces an abundance of rice, also wheat, barley, dates and other fruits, among which are musk and water melons, the latter weighing from 35 to 40 lbs. ; 3 and the revenue of the district of Khatif, independent of the pearls, is 86,000 German crowns. 4 A little way westward of the town are some remains which are supposed to mark the site of ancient Gerrha, the Regio Macina of the Greeks. 5 The desert district of Debenah succeeds, and stretches north- District of westward of El Ah'sa, along the Gulf, near the upper extremity De ena ' of which is Grane, or Quade, a considerable town situated on a kind of peninsula at the southern side of a fine bay, forming an extensive harbour.

Grane is 43 miles S.W. of the bar of the Euphrates, with which river it has a second communication by going round the Island of Boobian; it is completely an Arab town, the houses being clay-built, with several small flat-roofed apartments, built round a court; and it probably contains more than 8000 persons. It is situated in a very arid country, badly supplied with water, and almost deprived of verdure and cultivation, with the exception of a few dates; but in other respects the place is flourishing, having about 800 bagalas for the trade by sea to India and other parts. It carries on an inland trade by means of caravans, which go to Yemen, Nedjd, the Hijaz, &amp;c., and also from the neighbouring city of Basrah to Mekkah, &amp;c. The interior of El Ah'sa presents a varied surface, contain- ing a good deal of desert, but having at intervals camps or vil lages and sometimes towns. It is subdivided into several small districts, the most considerable of which bears the same name; it is also called Lahissa, and is justly celebrated for its small TownofFoof. but remarkably active breed of horses. Foof, the capital, is surrounded by a mud wall 50 feet high, with two gates, and a ditch: it is situated about 96 miles south-eastward of Khatif; and, including the suburbs, a large open village with cultivated grounds and date plantations to the eastward; there are about 15,000 inhabitants.

On the road to the capital, about 54 miles from Khatif, is the walled village of Jomiah, situated in the midst of date groves, and abundantly supplied with water, especially an extensive lake, which fertilizes the adjacent plain. 1 Three quarters of a mile northward of Foof is the fort of Mubarrez, or Mubuyez, surrounded by a deep ditch defended by lofty towers; it has one gate leading to an extensive open suburb, which, with the inhabitants of the fort itself, probably amount to 10,000 souls.

Wheat, barley and rice are cultivated here, also apricots, figs, melons, and other fruits; and the tamarisk is sufficiently large to be used in roofing dwellings. 1 Elsewhere permanent villages are occasionally met with, which are separated from one another by desert tracts encrusted with salt, and occa sionally by patches of sand between low ranges of hills, and at intervals occur the camps of the Bedawins. Between Amer Rabbia and El Ah' sa by the short road, the surface is covered with grass, bushes, &amp;c. ; amongst the latter are the babul-tree {mimosa) and some others bearing wild plums; deer and horses are found in this part of the country, 2 but there is only one village, Howarah, which is situated on the frontier of Howarah.

To these Route from must be added the route from the coast of Phoenicia, through ScaspLn Baalbec and Palmyra, into Assyria; and one which, diverging Sea. from this at a point beyond the Tigris, proceeded to the Cas pian Sea. Some inferior routes also crossed the peninsula between the Persian and Arabian Gulfs. Tyre not only created, but long maintained, a mercantile activity on the seas and in the harbours of Arabia. 1 This activity existed in the time of Arrian, who observes, 2 that the whole of Arabia abounds with mariners, pilots and merchants: the latter are said to have exported native commodities to all the ports beyond the Straits quite to Baryganza (Beroche). At a later period a vessel of Seraf is stated (by Abu Sai'd) to have been found on the coast of Syria ; and, if the statement could be relied on, this would prove that the Arabians had then circumnavigated Africa. In the time of Solomon commerce was in full activity by the route of Tadmor; and there is little doubt that trading voyages down the Arabian Gulf were made before the time that the Jewish monarch sent ships to Ophir. Subsequently Beroea supplanted Tadmor in the wilderness as an emporium ; and the camels of the Arabs and Turkomans transported goods from different parts of the coast to Aleppo in the space of from 20 to 50 hours, according to the route chosen. European goods were either carried from that city to the eastward on other animals, or transported by water. In the sixteenth century England largely shared in this com merce, when a fleet of boats was kept at Bir, and the nature and objects of the trade to Babylon were clearly defined.

A few set out from Damascus and Jerusalem, and also from Egypt and 'Oman to the interior of the country; those from the last-men tioned territory convey Indian goods, and are usually accom panied by pilgrims.

But it is to be observed that, however oppressive the exactions may appear, they only amount to a small per-centage on the passing goods, and are not sufficiently formidable to affect materially the profit derived from the commerce. It is uncertain whether the name of the peninsula was derived from the Hebrew, arabah, or oreheh, a wilderness, or from the simple word arah, which in Hebrew, as well as in the language of the country, means a multitude composed of dif ferent tribes; which has always been the character of the popu lation of Arabia. The Turks, the Persians, and most other Asiatics, give to this territory the name of Arabistan, but the people themselves call it either Belad-el-Arab or Jezirat-el- Arab (the Arabian Island); which name is understood to be derived from Arab, one of their ancestors. In the Old Testa ment it is generally designated Kedar, 1 from the son of Ish- mael, or Kedem, 2 before, or east; and Erz Kedem (the Eastern Land) was in the first instance applied to the part of Arabia lying eastward of Palestine, and inhabited by the descendants of Hagar and Ketura ; 3 as well as to that which lies more southward; from this last region the sons of Esau drove the Horites of Mount Seir. The Arabs are generally, in the Bible, designated children of the East ; 4 they are the Cedrei or Kedarenians of Pliny.f The tract thus occupied by the posterity of Esau forms one of the three great divisions named by Ptolemy, viz., Arabia Petraea, 6 which geographically is part of the Hijaz, and is sur rounded on the other sides by Egypt, Palestine, and a part of Syria.

Most of this terri tory was the gift of Abraham to the sons of his concubines. 6 Although mountainous and rocky, it produces wool, goats' hair, honey, wax, wheat, and barley; and the princes of Kedar were the merchants who supplied Tyre with lambs, rams, and goats. 7 In the time of Ahab, King of Israel, Mesha, King of Moab, contributed an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thou sand rams, with the wool; 8 and about the same period the Arabians, in addition to a tribute of silver and other presents, furnished to Jehosophat, King of Judah, 7700 sheep and 7700 goats. 9 The chief town and capital of all Arabia was Arecem, the Rekem of the Arabs; 10 so named, says Josephus, after 1 Genesis, chap.

The town, which contained the palace of Aretas, the King of Arabia, 3 is situated in a deep and narrow rocky fissure, 2000 paces long, enclosed by inaccessible mountains, leaving only one entrance; on the sides of which this surprising city was hollowed out in the clefts of the rocks, it is said, by the Tha- mudites. 4 Arabia Deserta, the next of the ancient divisions, touches the preceding from Ezra to Thapsacus, 5 and extends from Mespo- tamia to El Hajir, and also to the borders of Nedjd and Hijaz, Ancient people or Yemen in its greatest extent. It was occupied by the Com- Deselta. ia chabeni and Aesitse near the Euphrates; the Catanii, or Batansei, towards Syria, and the Agabeni on the borders of Arabia Felix. Besides these there were the Rhaabeni, and lastly the Orcheni on the Persian Gulf. 6 Arabia Felix. The principal division, Arabia Felix, is that part of the peninsula which also bears the name of Yemen; and which probably was first occupied during the western spread of man kind. The latter name has the double signification of the right, or south (the spectator looking eastward from Syria), and feli city or prosperity (youmn). It is stated, that when the sons of Kaktan, the son of Amir, the son of Szaleh, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, settled in this place, the Arabs said, the sons of Kaktan will be happy ; 7 and from this circumstance the name of the province is supposed to have been derived. This limited tract was soon extended, and became the seat of the Himyaritic kingdom; and it was afterwards known as the territory of the Sabeans, which in the time of Strabo was embellished with temples, palaces, and houses, like those of Egypt. 8 Under the name of Arabia Felix, it was gradually 1 Ant., hb.

And, it may be added, as an indication that these two branches of the line of Noah have had possession of the country, that in Southern Arabia there are found the names of Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, Sab- techa, Sheba, and Dedan, the sons and grandsons of Cush, 2 and also those of Sheba, Havilah, Almodad, Hazarmaveth, Hadoram, and Ophir, the sons of Joktan. 3 Arabic MS., 1357, in the British Museum; translated by Dr. Aloys Sprenger. s Genesis, chap.

XXV.] THE ANCIENT TRIBES. 659 According to the Arabian historians, 'Ad, king of Yemen, Ancient led the .greater part of the giant (powerful) race of Ham into Africa, and made a settlement along the Nile ; and it is stated Africa - in the history of Arabia, written by King Juba, about thirty years before Christ, that the people living between Meroe and Syene, were not originally Ethiopians, but Arabs of the first or Cushite branches. 1 To these branches belonged the Tasim and Jadis (in Bahrein), the Adites (in Yemen, and part of Arabia Petrsea), the Thamoudites, the Amalekites, the Jorhamites, the Obailites (Abil or 'Obail), the Bern Abd Dhakhan, and the Omayyim or Omaim. 2 These were the Arab el Ariba, the pure Arabs, or Arabs by excellence (Kou- lass), who are now extinct, with the exception of some traces of the Amalekites (Imlik or Amlik), and the Adites, who are disseminated amongst the modern tribes. Besides the preceding tribes, there were on the border of Syria, the Casluhim, the Capthorim, the Horim, the Rephaim. the Emim, Zuzim, and Zamzummim, 3 all branches of the Canaanites, many of which have disappeared; but, according to the historians of the country, the Berbers of the present day are descendants of Ham through those branches. In the Appendix to this volume are given three tables, exhi biting the three great branches of the Arab family. The first contains the descendants of Ham; the second, those of Shem; and the third the mixed race, or that which descends from Ishmael; and there are added a series of tables exhibiting the names of the modern tribes with their numerical strengths. The history of the country is almost entirely confined to The descend- that of the second and third branches of the people; who, and Ishmael having never been conquered, have remained free from admix- ^epSsuia. ture with any foreign race. In general they have confined themselves within the limits of the peninsula; the Tobbai, however, during the period of their greatest prosperity, carried their arms to central Asia, and, at a later period, religious enthusiasm enabled the Muslim Arabs to subdue a consider- 1 Sharpe's Early History of Egypt, p. 96. 8 Arabic MS. in the British Museum, 7357. 3 Gen., chap.

Greatest extent able portion of Asia, the northern shores of Africa, and even empke Arabian to enter Europe itself. The Arabian empire then extended from the confines of Tartary to the interior of Africa, and from the western part of India to the shores of the Atlantic. But, with the exception of the bold attempt of the Wahhabi Ibn Sihoud, Arabia has since exercised no influence beyond its own boundaries. The Cushites having been the first people who emigrated from Mesopotamia, their language was necessarily one of the most ancient which has been used by mankind ; and there are fair grounds for believing that this is what is now known as The Himyantic the Himyaritic, which is understood to be still spoken by the spokenf 6 8ti11 tribe of Ehhkeli, in the country near Mirbat and Zhafur, 1 and is almost identical with the dialect in use amongst the inha bitants of Mahre and Shehri. 2 It is exceedingly rich in the articulations and sounds ; 3 and has a character of a square form, to which much similarity may be traced in that which is used in the languages of Phoenicia and Abyssinia, both of which are derived from the Aramaic. The inscriptions in the Musnad, which have been found at Nakb-el-Hajar, also at Hisn Ghorab and Jebel Hamum, three miles from the village of Mayoki in Wadi Sheikawi, sufficiently connect the inhabitants of this part of the country with the ancient Tobbai. The language here spoken is sup posed to be the remains of that which was used by the Aadites, who, according to general belief, occupied Hadra- maut, Shehr, Mahrah, and some of the territory more northward. The followers It appears to have been adopted by the followers of Kaktan spokeadialect instead of their own, which was the Souriyyanih branch of of the Aramaic, Aramaic ; this last is supposed to have been used by that people when they quitted the plains of Mesopotamia; and also at the period when Abraham migrated from thence.

XXV.] ANCIENT RELIGION OF THE ARABS. 661 Souriyyanih, therefore, seems to have been a language inter mediate between the Chaldean and that of the Canaanites. It is nearly the same as the Arabic of the Koran, which was one of the two ancient languages of Arabia. 1 An ordinary dialect now generally prevails throughout the territory. Without doubt the Cushites carried with them from Baby- The earliest Ionia the religion of the patriarchs, a good outline of which £ Arab/was appears in the tenets of Khaled Ben Sanan Habsita. These th a a t t ri ^ c ^ e are, first, one God, who is the Creator and Governor of the P world; secondly, the resurrection of the dead; and, thirdly, the punishment of vice and the reward of virtue. 2 To this pure religion soon succeeded ' the adoration of heavenly spirits, as mediators between man and one immutable Holy Being, and to these they raised temples and altars for sacrifices and supplications, to which were subsequently added fastings.' 3 It may easily be imagined how powerfully the first wan derers through Arabia would be attracted by the softened light of the Queen of Stars, which at once illumined their steps during their lengthened journeys, and regulated the periods of time; and it is not, therefore, surprising that the moon became the object worshipped by Ad and his subjects. 4 But, ere long, the 'Adite worship was superseded by that The worship of Saba the grandson of Yarab, who was surnamed Ab-del- supereedeTby Shams, servant of the sun, 5 no doubt because he established that of BaaL the religion of Baal; and probably, also, because he adopted as a measure of time, the solar in preference to the lunar year. The Canaanites worshipped both the sun and moon; and on the adoration of these two heavenly bodies was engrafted that of the seven planets, the twelve signs of the zodiac, and twenty-four constellations; these became the objects of wor ship in Yemen. But, in other parts, other objects of adora tion were chosen.

There were also the Syrian Gods, Asaf and Naicla ; 2 and Surva and Ya'uk, two idols which, it is pretended, were worshipped in the time of Noah. 3 After wards deceased men became objects of adoration; but some, as the Korashites and Beni Kenana, worshipped the Creator, (Aziz) ; others paid divine honours to angels or genii, whilst some denied all kinds of revelation, and followed the very lowest kind of idolatry. The tribe of Kodhail worshipped Sawa ; the tribe Modlig and the tribes of Yemen, Yagtruth ; Dhu el Kela worshipped the eagle (Nasr) ; Hamdan wor shipped Ya'uk ; and Tafif, Allat. But the followers of Shem generally, and the descendants of Abraham more particularly, continued to be pure theists, until their tenets were gradually lost in Sabaism, which became general in the time of the Israelites, when even the ornaments about the necks of the camels, particularly, one of a crescent shape 4 had reference to this idolatry. 5 Belief of the Astrology always formed a part of Sabaism, in which mode astrology/ 11 of faith the heavenly bodies were peopled with divine intel ligences, by whom it was supposed the lives and actions of men were regulated. The Arabians believed the predictions of astrology, but their faith was not so comprehensive as that which prevailed in Chaldea and Egypt, where a separate class of men, devoted to astronomy, professed, from celestial obser vations, to deduce a knowledge of coming events. Amongst the Arabs the regularity of the movements of the heavenly bodies was made subservient to a more practical purpose, and the stars became objects of interest as the guides of their wanderings; whilst the return of the seasons, the phases of the moon, and other phenomena were observed with care, on account of their use in regulating the ordinary concerns of 1 Volney's Supplement to Larcher's Herodotus, p. 193. 2 Ibid. 3 From the Kamus, by Dr. Aloys Sprenger.

The Arabs, in fact, maintained that no individual deserved to be considered an astrologer who was not thoroughly acquainted with the science of astronomy. No doubt, at the period of their migration into Arabia, the Cushites possessed some knowledge of astronomy, and this may have been extended by the arrival of the Kaktanites, and the descendants of Abraham from Mesopotamia The great pastoral wealth of the Arabian chiefs in ancient Reception of times enabled them to dispense, especially to strangers, an travellers - extensive hospitality. Men were employed in the day time to collect, and even compel, guests to come in; and that this generosity might be equally indulged at night, beacons were kept burning to point out to the benighted traveller where he might find shelter and entertainment. If the stranger chanced to be one of the rawi, or travelling historians of those days, or even a muhaddith, that is, a reciter of tales, a class of men who availed themselves of the opportunity to offer occasional compliments to the host and his guests, he was loaded with presents to an extent which sometimes impo verished the donor. A circumstance of this nature gave rise to the proverb, ' like the generosity of Hatim Tai,' Such hospitality was not confined to the great, for the tent or house of an ordinary chief, like those of Abraham and Lot, was always open, and the host frequently sat at the door for the purpose of inviting the wayfaring man. After being refreshed, the stranger proceeded on his way, to enjoy at his need the hospitality of another chief; and he was usually furnished with a small supply of food suitable for the continuation of his journey. Even an enemy was sure of a hospitable reception. The pagan Arabs abstained from incursions and every kind Occasional of hostility during the four sacred months of the year, and o^CSs. likewise during the continuation of many of the ancient fairs, which were established for the benefit of commerce and the extension of social intercourse between distant places. One fair, which lasted nearly a month, took place in Dumak-el- Fandel, at certain periods, for the purpose of buying, selling, and barter; another took place in Hijaz, near the present temple of Mekkah, probably on the plain of Arafat. There664 ANCIENT FAIRS. [CHAP. XXV. was one in 'Oman, another in Arem, and another in Kais- esh-Shajz, which continued several days. A fair was held at 'Aden for aromatic drugs, precious stones, and other valu able merchandise, and one at Rabiya, in Hadramaut, where were sold goat's leather, and cloths of different colours, which were manufactured in I'ran. But the fair at Poetical con- Akath was the most interesting of all. Here poets competed S of 'Akath with one another for a prize, and the poem of the victor was copied in letters of gold. 1 This fair, and indeed nearly all those which were instituted for commercial dealings have ceased since the time of Muhammed, whose religion and policy have been most prejudicial to the country. andofOukazh. The fair of Oukazh, was not only a great annual market, at which all the tribes of Arabia met for the purposes of com merce, but it served as a focus, in which was collected the literature of the country. Here poets, who were also war riors, met to celebrate their individual exploits in verse, and thus peaceably contend for the honours due to military merit. This fair was held between Taif and Nakhlah, and commenced with the new moon of Dhou'lqadah, which was the commence ment of a period of three months, during which all hostilities were suspended. Whilst the fete lasted, the competitors appeared in masks; and, in the recitations, their voices were supplied by those of the public criers, who remained near them, and repeated aloud their words. As the competitors were unknown to one another, the meeting could not give rise to any quarrels ; but, on the contrary, it was the means of pre serving a spirit of emulation among the different tribes there assembled. Moreover, this congress of poets contributed to unite in one the various dialects, and improve the language of Arabia. 2 Before the time of Muhammed, the chiefs of Arabia not only prided themselves on a long line of ancestors, but gloried in the number of followers, the extent of means at command for their support, and freedom from the vice of avarice.

He was frequently exercised m mock combats; and he was almost constantly engaged in racing, hawking, or hunting. A feudalism pre- vaiied in Arabia; and the military institutions of the country were essentially chivalric ; youths of rank, as soon as they became qualified, were admitted to the rank of warriors, and to the enjoyment of all the privileges of that class ; and, like the knights of Europe, they considered war as the only occupation m which, consistently with their dignity, they could engage. The tribe was led into the field by its chief, and the chief fought for victory; but his followers fought for him ; and not unfrequently, in order to save the effusion of much blood, a war was decided by champions selected by both parties. A due subordination to the chief of the tribe was maintained; but there existed a spirit of companionship among the members, which secured mutual support in battle. The banner of the tribe was the rallying point; but when a prodigious effort was to be made, a young and beautiful maiden on horseback took its place, that, by her presence, she might incite the warriors to the performance of such acts of valour as the occasion should demand. In addition to the preceding circumstances, in which the customs of the ancient Arabs resembled those of Europe in the middle ages, may be mentioned trials by ordeal; the point of Trials by honour in keeping the promise of protection; and the sus- ordea1, pensions of hostilities on certain days of the year, particularly during the seasons of the great festivals. During the times of ignorance, as those were called which preceded the epoch of the Hijrah, the religion which the Arabs had derived from Mesopotamia and Chaldea, had departed from its original purity. Some persons even denied the existence of a Creator, asserting that Nature was the source and preserver of life, and the majority were sunk in the grossest idolatry. VOL. i. 4 Q666 ANCIENT SCIENCE AND ART. [CHAP. XXV. The philosophy of Arabia in the earliest ages may be collected from the dialogues in the Book of Job: it is evident that the Astronomy, stars were then divided into constellations ; for in one passage 1 Bookof Job. the Deity calls upon the Patriarch to say whether he can bind the delights of Chimah, and loosen the bands of Chesil, which have been interpreted to signify the Pleiades and Orion. A star, or cluster, is also mentioned under the name of Mazzaroth; and it is remarkable that the isolation of the earth in space is indicated 2 by its being suspended from nothing. The balancing of the clouds, the formation of rain, and the effects of frost in contracting the breadth of water, are noticed, 3 together with the quarters of the horizon from whence proceed tempests and fair weather. 4 Concerning the arts, we find written characters in use, and the practice of engraving on stones. 5 Mining and smelting operations are alluded to; and various precious stones enumerated. 6 Molten looking-glasses, probably metallic mir rors, are mentioned ; 7 and the shortness of life is illustrated by comparisons with the swiftness of post-messengers and ships. 8 objects of Respecting natural history, it will be found that many noticed in that beasts and birds are incidentally noticed in the same book; and the plants which are mentioned prove that botany must have been attentively studied; agriculture was practised, and the sounds of the harp, the organ, and the timbrel, were heard at the social meetings of the people Owing to the nature of the country, and the mode of living, the people of Arabia have had but little opportunity of dis playing their ingenuity in the erection of buildings; yet the bSiigs in structures in Tehameh, 'Oman, Nedjd, and the Hijaz, which Arabia g a re almost entirely in the Saracenic style, show much taste. The Khanats, elsewhere described, are precisely similar to those of Persia; and the excavations of Petrsea, Yemen, and the Hijaz, are vast monuments of the skill and industry of the ancient people of the country. The great dyke of Mareb, among other structures, is in that style of architecture which 1 Chap. XXXVIII., v. 31, 32. 2 Chap. XXVI., v. 7. 3 Chap. XXXVII., v. 10, 16. 4 Ibid., v. 9, 22. 5 Chap.

They consist of a series of subterraneous apartments, contain ing reservoirs which are connected together by means of earthen pipes proceeding from the innermost tanks, which receive their supplies of rain water from the heart of the limestone rock. The ancient fortress, on the summit of Mount Agatha, in Reservoirs of the Termino of Mercadel, in the island of Minorca, contains Minorca - two remarkable cisterns for rain water; both unquestionably Moorish, as is evident from the nature of their construction, as well as an Arabic inscription on one of the towers of the enclosure. These vast reservoirs differ from those of Gibraltar, by being raised buildings, instead of excavations, and they are at the same time of much greater dimensions, being together capable of containing 2173 tuns, or upwards of half a million of gallons. The enclosures to contain the water are con structed of large blocks of concrete, known by the Moorish name of Tapia, which is composed of sand, lime, and pebbles, well tempered, thoroughly wrought together, and then moulded in wooden frames ; walls of this kind possess strength, solidity, and durability, equal to those of stone itself, 1 particularly when covered with a coat of cement.

His voice is rather effeminate, and does not, therefore, accord with his manly com plexion, which is a dark brown, tinged with olive. His dress is probably as simple as it was in the days of Abraham ; and its form is apparently the same as that which is indicated by striped cloaks Herodotus. 1 That of the ordinary Bedawin consists of a thick cloak of moderate width, having, up and down it, alternate stripes, either of brown or black, and white. Beneath the cloak, and under a pair of ample cotton drawers, is worn a thick shirt, of the same material; the drawers are kept in their place by means of a girdle of embroidered leather, about three inches and a half broad, containing sometimes a small curved dagger, with an ornamented hilt; but more generally only a clasp-knife, suspended by a chord on the right side. Strong sandals, or coarse shoes, of red, or, more frequently, yellow leather, cover the feet, and the legs are rarely encum bered with stockings. Instead of the ordinary turban of other eastern people, the head and the greater part of the face of the Bedawin are protected by a yellow striped kerchief, made of silk and cotton, one end of which is allowed to fall behind, and two others on the shoulders; the kerchief has a row of points of the same materials, neatly plaited, by way of border. The kefiyeh. This head-dress, called a kefiyeh, is kept in its place by means of a peculiar cord turban, of mixed colours, composed of camel's hair; the cord is about an inch in diameter, and is rolled five or six times round the kefiyeh, as near the top of the head as possible. On his finger are several turquoise rings. Summer and In the summer time the Bedawin is content with the cotton dresses! 118 shirt; while the sheikhs and richer individuals wear, at this season, a long dress, either of bright-striped silk, or printed calico. 2 When travelling, an Arab has commonly an abba in addition. This is a large outer cloak in one, or, at most, two pieces, and of the simplest make, being almost square, and having an opening for the neck, with one on each side for the 1 Lib. VII., cap. Ixix. 8 See Plate XXIII.CHAP. XXV.] ARMS OF THE ARABS. 669 arms. The Arabs seldom shave the head, and the hair is eit er plaited, or left in a natural state, falling in a profusion of ringlets which sometimes almost hide the face. They take more pains with the trappings of their horses, and the orna ments of their camels, than with their own persons ; and they pride themselves on the number of trinkets worn by the females belonging to the family. Arms may be considered an indispensable part of the dress of an Arab, for he is seldom, if ever, without them. The ordinary weapon is a bamboo lance, about 13 feet in length. Lances and ornamented with two round tufts of black ostrich-feathers cSl 8word8 near the point, which is tipped with iron, usually square, and about eight inches long. 1 In addition to the lance, he fre quently has a couple of javelins to hurl at his enemy when he is unable to reach him with the lance. The bow and arrow are occasionally, though rarely, seen. A much curved sword is the common weapon, and the Arab also carries a small round leather shield, slung at his back. An iron mace, bristling with pointed spikes at the larger end, is also an ordinary weapon of the Bedawin; but when this cannot be procured, he contents himself with a short stick, having a large round knob at the extremity, which is generally ornamented with rude carving. In close quarters, this primitive weapon would deal out a severe blow ; and, in addition, the Arab is gene rally provided with a common sling for throwing stones, when game, or his enemy are at a certain distance. These last are, however, as may be supposed, the weapons of the very poorest people. Whenever it is possible to obtain one, the Arab uses a long matchlock-gun, and two powder- Matchlocks, horns, one filled with fine powder for priming, and the other, which is much larger, containing ordinary powder for loading. He also has several leather pouches pendent from his shoulders, containing different implements for keeping the matchlock in repair, and carrying wadding, spare match, tinder, flint, and steel. But the Arab is equipped in the most approved style, when. 1 See Plate LXXXIII.670 POLITENESS OF THE ARABS. [CHAP. XXV. instead of the powder-horns and other articles, he is provided with a particular kind of belt, which is either worn round the waist, or over the shoulder, and contains a certain number of separate charges; each enclosed in a piece of reed corked at the upper end. The balls are apart in a leather pouch, so Chain armour that the whole is ready for use in a moment. Chain armour and hdn^ts ^ gteelj an ^1^ ; also padded armour, made of soft leather, are occasionally seen in some parts of Nedjd, as well as the adjoining territory of Yemen: whatever the armour be, it is constantly worn, for it is the custom of the Arab to be at all times equally prepared for hostilities; a feel ing of security being quite unknown to him. Cleanliness of The day commences with prayers ; but a scarcity of water, the Arabs. ^ tdt ^ difficulty of carrying it, compels the Arab to dispense with most of the ablutions enjoined by the Koran; yet, considering the circumstances in which he is placed, and particularly his wandering life, the habits of the Arab are cleanly. Even in the Desert, he always washes his hands, before, as well as after a meal; and he appears to take more pains with his face and teeth, than is customary among Euro peans. According to Burckhardt, 1 the tooth-ache is unknown in Arabia. Salutations. Gravity of demeanour, and natural politeness, approaching to formality, appear to be an inseparable part of the Arab's character. He never enters, nor leaves a tent, without ex changing the usual forms of recognition and salutation with all those who may happen to be present. These salutations which include kissing on each cheek, when the parties have not met for some little time, are repeated with untiring pati ence through the round of visits, which occupy each successive day. The women are nearly of the same complexion as the men, but they have rather less of the olive colour. Their faces, particularly round the eyes, together with their hands and feet, are stained with indigo, which is worked under the skin with the point of a needle, so as to represent stars and other 1 Bedawln and WahMbi, p. 54.CHAP.

Their eyelids and lips are stained with purple, and The hands and their nails, as well as the soles of their feet, and the palms of feetstained - their hands, are dyed with henna, 1 of an orange colour. The custom of painting the face existed in the time of Jeremiah ; 2 and it has been supposed that Job's third daughter took her name from the implements used in this operation. 3 In the left cartilage of the nose is worn a large gold ring, Nose-jewds, for which is sometimes substituted an ornament, consisting of &amp;c ' two or three circular plates of gold, in the form of a rosette, in the centre of which, attached to the pin passing through the side of the nose, is a turquoise or some other stone. 4 Numerous rings of gold, silver, or glass, according to the means of the wearer, adorn the wrists or arms, while large ornaments of silver, iron, or glass, surround the ankles; the metal ornaments are hollow, and sometimes there are attached to them a number of small bells. These are called khalkhal, and the rings hejil. Coarse cotton trowsers, drawn close round the ankles, and loose above, are worn, while a long shapeless dress, of a deep blue colour, and of the same material as the trowsers, extends from the neck to the feet; the latter are almost invariably The face not bare. The head is either bare, or covered with a dark blue ceakdl^ con cotton kerchief, which is thrown over the black, and sometimes matted hair. Veils and wrappers, which almost hide the face, are in use among the sedentary Arabs; but the Bedawin females only cover the face when they are on a journey. 5 When young, they are pretty; but, owing to their exposed life, they early become ill-favoured, and, in this respect, the men have greatly the advantage. The Arabs take two meals in a day, the lighter in the morning, and the more substantial one after sunset; but coffee is taken several times in the interval. They live chiefly on vegetables, such as rice, wheat, and dhurrah, or barley- 1 The Lawsonia alba of Linnaeus, whose leaves are dried and powdered for the purpose. a Though thou rentest thy face with painting.—Jer., chap.

They, however, readily eat jerboas, 1 lizards. Locusts eaten, hedgehogs, locusts, and, in general, every animal which they happen to meet with during their journeys, except the hog. Locusts, strung together, are exposed for sale in some of the petty bazaars; these are usually broiled, although it is by no means uncommon to eat them without any kind of dressing; and the liver of the sheep is eaten in a raw state. 2 The milk of the camel, which is poor and slightly saline, forms a part of the food of the Arabs and of their horses, and sometimes an inferior kind of butter is made from it. The Camel's flesh flesh of that animal is so much esteemed, that when lame- Tdainty!* 1 aS ness, illness, or any other cause arrests its progress during a journey, it is speedily killed and divided amongst all who have any claim to a share of what is sought with the utmost avidity. Sour milk, Cheese, and goat's or sheep's milk, dates, bread, or dhurrah, honey cake, some boiled rice mixed with butter, a preparation of bruised wheat called burghul, or a cake composed of honey and butter, form the chief food of the Bedawins. The common evening meal of the poorer sort is a dish called ayesh, of flour and sour camel's milk, made into a paste and boiled. On the arrival of a stranger, a kid or lamb is either baked whole, or put into a pilaf. Fish is not much in request, nor is it eaten from choice even when it happens to be abundant, which is often the case near the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris. The favourite beverage is sour milk, called Leben, the prepa ration of which is understood everywhere throughout Arabia. Cheese is universally eaten, and in some places it is very good. Throughout Mesopotamia, and especially in the market of Baghdad, it is scarcely inferior to our Chedder. But the greater part of the Arab cheese is of a very different quality ; it is usually formed into small lumps, less than the size of a bean, much salted, and is kept in leathern bags for use, both at home and on a journey. Butter is almost as common as cheese, and it is made in a most primitive manner. A skin half filled with milk being 1 The Anizeh regard the jerboa as a great dainty.—Burckhardt's Bedawin and WahMbi, p. 35. « Ibid ^ p 138CHAP.

When fresh it is pretty good ; but when kept long it is scarcely more than tolerable oil.

The buildings at the north-western extremity of the ter- Buildings on ritory, both ancient and modern, have frequently been noticed; ^ternfrontier. and the buildings at the western side 1 scarcely differ from those on the eastern, or Mesopotamian side. The latter are of rubble masonry, with terraced roofs; and usually contain upper as well as lower apartments, which are generally of small size, badly built and imperfectly lighted. But an infe rior abode, a kind of hut, made of wattles or other light materials, is occasionally constructed; this is sometimes a mere cube, scarcely exceeding six feet on each side, at other times it is round, and terminates with a dome which is covered with cloth ; in each case the entrance is through a very low door. The building is movable, so as to suit a people in a half-nomadic state, and may be considered as having an inter mediate place between stone houses and tents. The latter differ from those of the Persians, Kurds, and Turkomans, 2 chiefly in being of a more portable construction. The shape Tents of the is generally oval, and the material is of black goat's hair, Arabs- mixed with that of the camel; this is usually supported by two poles eight or ten feet high, which are placed along the middle; but when the tent is more spacious, as is that of the sheikh, shorter poles are placed at intervals, usually three towards each side, and three in the middle. A low, movable curtain, often of wool, closes the tent on the side exposed to the sun or cold, according to the season, and another curtain separates the men's apartment from that of the women ; the former contains the packsaddles of the camels, against which the men recline. 1 As described by Niehbuhr, vol.

Many of them follow strictly the laws of the ancient Rechabites, for they neither build houses nor sow seed, and they dwell in tents. 2 Slaves, when they have any, are treated in every respect as part of the family. The comfort, and even the wealth of an Arab depends upon his camels: every man has at least one; with ten a man is considered poor; with thirty or forty his circumstances are easy, and with sixty he is rich. 3 The govern- Among the great tribes the government is strictly patri- Sir 1 - archal, with gradations of authority, according to the number of people, from the head of a single family to the malik or sheikh el kebir, whose power extends over a number of tribes. In the book of Job there are frequent allusions to a regular system of governnent in Arabia, and particularly to the admi nistration of justice; the Hebrew lawgiver himself con descended to follow the advice of his Arabian father-in-law in appointing men of truth and hating covetousness to be rulers over thousands, and rulers over fifties, and rulers over tens. 4 Among the Arabs at the present day, the individual 1 See Plate LVIII. 4 Jeremiah, ch. xxxv,, v. 7 ; Diod.

Unless there should be some decided failure of means or The sheikhs capacity, the she'ikhship is generally continued in the same taUtyT hospi family, although in some rare instances a change is made in favour of a braver, and more generous individual belonging to another. The sheikh does not, however, derive any revenue from his followers, but, on the contrary, his patriarchal posi tion obliges him to keep an open house; for which his own property, and a proportion of what is derived from the employ ment of the tribe as carriers, added to a share of the tribute, and occasionally of the plunder, afford the means. He has the privilege of leading the tribe against an enemy, and, in conjunction with the chief men, of settling the terms of peace. He also regulates the movements of the camp, fixes the site to be occupied, and has the right of entertaining strangers. As head of the tribe, he is at once the lawyer and the judge, and when his authority fails to reconcile the quarrels of his people, he decides upon the case, and dispenses justice, and dispense subject, however, to an appeal to the malik; and, in reality, J his power is very limited. There are few written laws, except those framed by Muhammed himself; but to these have been added various customs handed down for ages from father to son ; so that the petty governments of Arabia have become mixtures of theocracy, monarchy, and democracy. The sen tence of the sheikh, which may extend to life, is frequently commuted at the intercession of a third party, with the addition of a present; but at the same time there is an under standing that wherever the delinquent goes, he is bound to declare his own guilt, as well as the sentence, and the name of his benefactor. An Arab taken in the act of robbing an individual belong ing to his own camp, is condemned to lose his right hand; but custom allows him to save the extreme penalty by forfeit ing five she camels. 1 But when a man who has robbed those of 1 Burckhardt's Bedawm and Wahhdbi, p. 100. 4 R 2676 PUNISHMENTS FOR CRIMES.

Punishments another tribe, is taken by those whom he has plundered, he for robbery, -g at length i n ahole about two feet deep, with his hands tied, his feet chained, and his hair twisted to a stick on each side of his head. Tent poles, corn sacks, and other heavy articles are then heaped over him, leaving barely the power of breathing, so that his alternative is either a miserable death, or the payment of the highest possible ransom. 1 In the case of an attempt to rob the pilgrims, the usual mode of punishment is to impale the robbers at the moment the cara van starts for the next station, leaving them to perish on the stake, or to be devoured by wild beasts. 2 In the case of an unseen murder, the accused is obliged to lick a hot iron with his tongue. If burnt, he is pronounced guilty; and if not he is set at liberty : but he is liable to for feit a camel to the judge. Tortures Besides the preceding punishments, there are some peculiar inflictedf ly to the Arabs which are singularly cruel; but, happily, now almost obsolete. To extort money, the Aniz^h sew up the individual to the neck in a fresh camel's skin, which, being quite tight at first, causes such pain as it dries, that he soon gives in. Another punishment is to put him into a well covered with skins till he is almost suffocated. Elsewhere an iron visor is gradually screwed tighter under the chin till the effect is produced; or a bag of red pepper is tied over the mouth and nostrils, which being necessarily inhaled with the breath, painful suffocation is speedily the consequence. But the most refined cruelty said to be exercised by the Arabs is the prevention of sleep, a whip being applied for this purpose till the protracted torments of the unfortunate individual are terminated by death. Supplicants No cruelties are ever exercised upon an individual who has iri a formal manner sought the protection of the chief of the tribe whose hostility he has reason to dread. One form of appeal is to seize the tent pole of the she'ikh, and call out for his protection ; another is to throw a stone and hit him. 1 Burckhardt's Bedawin and WahMbi, p. 93. 2 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol.

They have neither imams nor priests, and they observe no fasts; more over, they enjoin the destruction of all buildings dedicated to saints. Friday, which was venerated in Arabia before the time of Muhammed, is their sabbath. Civil and religious equality appear to be the main objects with them; and it was part of their plan to banish the Turks, as well as other people who do not properly belong to the peninsula; on this account their religion is favoured by the Bedawms, who at one time spread its doctrines to the banks of the Euphrates, and the shores of the Persian Gulf. Superstition prevails throughout Arabia in great force. The supposed power of the evil eye is, perhaps, one of the most ancient and most rooted of their prejudices; and accidents occurring in a Superstitions, tribe or family, such as the death of an individual, or the loss of a camel, are ascribed unhesitatingly to some stranger who had, as they suppose, cast his eye upon the man or animal. The effect of enchantment, they think, is indicated in a long- continued illness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, &amp;c.; but more especially in the sudden loss of reason ; and against all these evils the Arab considers himself in a manner protected by wearing an amulet round his neck or arm. Dreams are supposed to foreshow every future event to indi-678 courtships.

A pretended necromancy also prevails in the country; practised. ^ or are individuals, like the witch of Endor, who profess to bring up within a magic circle any individual who may be named. Arabia is the land of fiction and romance, and tales of good and evil genii are still repeated by the travelling bards, who to the great delight of a large circle of hearers, sitting round the remains of a charcoal fire in the sheikh's tent, by such tales, or by singing traditional songs, repay the hospitality which they receive. Divorces Polygamy is sanctioned by the laws of Arabia, though the allowed. people rarely avail themselves of the privilege, one wife being considered sufficient. But divorces being permitted without a reason being assigned, a woman is often sent back to her family on the slightest suspicion ; a she camel must, however, be sent with her. The woman has also the power of divorce, and if unhappy, she may return to her parents. She cannot be reclaimed by her husband ; l but unless the latter should pronounce the divorce (ent ta' leka), she is prohibited from contracting another marriage. Manner of The out-door occupations of females in the desert afford application opportunities of something like an acquaintance being formed for a wife. by parties before marriage, a circumstance which can scarcely occur in a town ; but if a youth have not seen the lady whom he wishes to have for a wife, he depends upon the report of a female friend or relative ; this being satisfactory, he sends two or three individuals to make a formal proposal to the father. If the parties belong to any of the principal families, and especially if they are of different tribes, the embassy is made with great state, and is sometimes accompanied by the youth himself; in which case the lady has a private oppor tunity, by looking between the curtains, of judging for herself. Having privately expressed her approbation to her parents, a lengthened discussion between the families takes place concern ing the dowry ; this being at length reduced within reasonable 1 Burckhardt's Bedawin and Wahhdbi, pp. 63, 64.CHAP.

Manner of confirms the contract, and reioicinffs suited to the station of making the 4.1 • j i i i r* . marriage tne parties are made^ both before and at the marriage. Among contract, persons in ordinary circumstances, the father, on receiving a proposal, consults his daughter, and returns an answer, if affirmative, presents are sent to the family, according to the lover's means, and about five days later he kills a lamb, before witnesses, near the lady's tent, when the flowing of the blood completes the contract. Great feastings, with music and dancing then take place; and during the succeeding seven or eight days, the camp is a scene of confusion from the sounds of drums, horns, trumpets, and other instruments; at length the bride is conveyed in procession to her future home, seated on horseback, in a kind of sedan, and completely hidden either by the curtains or the bridal presents thrown over it. Great rejoicings take place on other occasions, as the birth of a son, the foaling of a mare, or the arrival of a guest. 1 But the course of true love does not always run smooth, even Eiopemems in Arabia; and sometimes, when the consent of the parents Seasonally, is withheld, a meeting of the parties by night takes place by appointment, and this is followed by a flight, the lover pro- viding swift horses for himself and his mistress. Immediately on their birth, children are named from some Circumcision, circumstance or locality which happens to strike the mother's fancy ; 2 and at the age of six or seven circumcision takes place. This ceremony was practised by the ancient Arabs, and it is still celebrated with feasting and rejoicing, in which usually several families join, for it generally happens, by a little arrangement, that there are several boys to be operated on at the same time. The flesh of camels and sheep, the latter roasted whole, is on such occasions distributed amongst the poorer people of the tribe. Deep and loud lamentations beginning in the tent of a person just deceased, announce the fact to the rest of the camp; and before the body is quite laid out, the mourning women, who are hired for the purpose, commence their 1 Burckhardt's Bedawin and Wahhdbi, p. 192. 2 Ibid., p. 55.680 FUNERAL CEREMONIES.

The funeral takes place in the simplest way, and almost imme diately after death; the women bewailing, and the men following the corpse. The body is carried on an open bier, which is unceasingly passed from the shoulders of one set of bearers to those of another; and at length it is deposited in a shallow grave, the head a little elevated and facing the east. In the case of a sheikh or principal warrior, his camel, stained a deep gray, approaching to black, is led after the body of his master, bearing his cloak and arms, all placed in disorder; and some tribes bury the sword, turban, and girdle with the Periods of body. The men of the camp mourn three days, without mourning. change of dress, and the women seven, fifteen, or forty days ; the latter wear a black borko, or face veil, a black gown, and even a black shift. 1 But those who have lost a near relative mourn during two or more years ; and the children, of each sex, cut off their tresses of hair in testimony of grief for the loss of a father. The sedentary Arabs, and sometimes also the Bedawins plant two cypress-trees by the grave of a friend, and ornament it with flowers, which they afterwards tend with care, in token of affection. Employments Watching their flocks is the only occupation out of doors Arabs male to which the sons of the desert submit; and their amuse ments are hawking, boar-hunting, and horse exercise, in which they use very short stirrups, that they may be enabled, by raising themselves up, to give more effect to the lance and the jerid. Within the tent the occupations of the men border on those which properly belong to women, such as 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol. II., p. 214.chap. xxv.] furniture of a tent. 681 milking the animals, and weaving with a simple loom, called Employments muton, consisting of three sticks. They also use a distaff, oflhe women - keeping in motion as the latter twists and untwists in spinning the wool or cotton. But cooking, fetching and carrying water, like Rebecca, 1 taking the camels to the pasture ground and to water, with the cares of the family at large, devolve almost entirely upon the women. As in the days of Abra ham, the latter have a portion of the tent to themselves ; 2 for a second tent is rarely possessed even by the inferior sheikhs, and sometimes two and even three families live together. The outer part of the tent is appropriated to the use of the Kitchen men, and to a horse when there is one ; it also serves occa- utensils - sionally as a place of shelter for some of the feeble goats and sheep. The inner apartment is the cooking place, the provi sion store, and the place in which the table and kitchen utensils are kept. The latter are extremely simple, and com prise a hand-mill, with two stones for grinding meal; a pestle and mortar for pounding coffee, two or three coffee-pots of different sizes, with a proportion of cups; a kind of portable oven, a large copper pot, an iron girdle for baking bread, some wooden bowls and coarse wooden spoons, a circular table cloth made of ornamented leather, a napkin sufficiently long to encircle it, so as to serve all the guests ; and lastly, a coarse carpet, or a mat if the carpet cannot be had. The Arabs meet at intervals during the day, but more par- Amusements ticularly at night, and usually in the sheikh's tent, which is 0 e men ' considered as free to all, and particularly to the passing stranger. And in the event of receiving a mission from another tribe, even if it be to declare war, the rites of hos pitality take their course before the business is entered upon. Their simple manner of life does not admit of much variety of occupation, and the evenings are generally passed in con versation, with a small cup of coffee now and then, or in play ing at dice or dominoes occasionally. They also have a kind of lottery which is decided by arrows previously marked in a particular way; these being drawn out of a bag or covered vessel. 1 Gen, ch. xxv., v. 5. VOL.

Thege amusemen t Sj w ith the addition of music from one or two of the rude instruments of the country, such as the rababa (a sort of primitive guitar), a kind of bagpipe, a hautboy, or a trumpet, serve to while away the time. At certain periods, however, the tent is enlivened by the visit of a pedlar going from camp to camp, to tempt the females with his finery, and interest the men by retailing news of the other tribes. Another, and perhaps more interesting visit is that of the muhaddith, the rawi, or the improvvisatore, who at once animates and charms the circle by traditional songs, tales, and the recitation of pieces of poetry, often made at the time of delivery, and suited to circumstances, the host and his tribe being lavishly complimented. Manner of With the exceptions of the preceding and some few other foray nga occupations and amusements, the nomadic life is alter nately one of listless idleness or extreme activity; the greatest energy being called forth when a predatory excursion is undertaken. On such occasions a certain number of the tribe, armed and mounted, make a rapid movement in order to surprise and fall upon some ill-protected point; returning with all speed, and bringing, if successful, the flocks and other spoil which they may have obtained. Not unfrequently they find that their own tribe has, by a similar foray, during their absence, been surprised and plundered. An engagement is usually preceded by a wild dance, in which the men, taking hold of each others' hands, vociferate a tvar-song. 1 But the disposition to engage in a pitched battle, or even in an ordinary open fight, has long since passed away. The tent of the sheikh is open at all times to the men of the tribe, many of whom assemble there when any public measure is contemplated; and on some of these occasions a venerable chief may be seen seated with his guests on carpets round a charcoal fire, giving brief directions, whilst coffee is being pre pared and served, for an intended movement, which, according to the season, may commence at night, at daylight, or the following morning. 1 See Plate XCI.CHAP. XXV.] REMOVAL OF A CAMP. 683 The Arab, feeling himself at home in every part of the Preparation desert, requires few preparations, even for the longest journey; foramarch - yet scarcely any scene is more animating than that which is presented by a tribe on the march. In the centre of an encampment is the tent of the emir or sheikh, which, as well as the others, has the lance of the proprietor planted upright at the entrance, and is surrounded by horses, camels, sheep, and goats. A change of residence being determined upon, the task of getting ready the provisions and culinary utensils devolves upon the women; and this being accomplished after the evening meal, all is considered to be ready. Next morn ing, the mixed flock of sheep and goats, accompanied by their keepers and many dogs, also the spare and brood camels, with their young, proceed onward some two or three hours before the camp is in motion. Three or four experienced guides, mounted on light camels are placed in advance, and a certain number of the horsemen of the tribe serve as a guard, watch ing carefully in front, and scouring to some little distance beyond each flank. Some of the shepherds bring up the rear of the flock, and these have generally in their bosoms one or two of the youngest lambs or kids, covered by their cloaks. Whilst this company advances slowly on, the camp is in the full bustle of striking tents and loading camels. These operations require time, especially as the women, in the per formance of the tasks allotted to them, do not, as in Europe, receive aid from the men. But the work being completed, the animals with the heavy baggage, such as tents, bags of grain, rolls of carpet, pots and pans, and fowls suspended in light baskets made of date branches, are sent forward. The Manner in women then take their places, each man endeavouring to women are prevent his wife from being exposed to the gaze of other men conveyed, when getting to her shebrye, or haudag. This is a sort of palanquin enclosed by richly-fringed crimson curtains, and is sufficiently large to permit the occupant at pleasure either to sit or lie at length. It is mounted on a camel, and every Arab who can afford the expense provides one for his wife. The negresses and other female attendants, as well as the children, are also accommodated on camels, the women gene-684 ESTABLISHMENT OF A CAMP. [CHAP. XXV. rally in a shekdof, which is a simpler machine than the former, being little more than a large pannier slung on each side of the animal; it is, however, enclosed by curtains^ like the shebrye. The women belonging to the poorest class of Bedawins have merely an open seat on the top of a rolled tent, or of the bedding, and not unfrequently they have to carry a child or two, either on the lap or in small baskets slung on each side; while thus seated they are frequently employed in kneading bread for the coming halt. Order of the The loading being a gradual operation, the animals move onward in successive groups, each group under the care of some Arabs on foot, who are employed in proportion of one to two, or, perhaps, three camels, which they guide in a track a little on one side of those taken by the preceding groups; so that each section finds pasture, for the animals. Thus an Arab tribe, when in motion, covers a considerable space in width as well as length ; the separate sections closely resemble one another; for each consists of a string of camels carrying tents, household stuff', women, and children, all advancing towards the intended halting-place. These, on account of the flocks, ought to be at a very moderate distance from one another; but when a want of water obliges the divisions to make a long march, a portion of the people advance as rapidly as they can, leaving the rest, with the flocks, to follow; and another day is allowed to these to reach the camp. Here not unfrequently a halt of two or three days takes place. When ever the ground favours it, the spot selected is on one side of the line of march&gt; so as not to be visible to other bodies who The tents dis- may happen to take the same route. The camp is formed reguiarity hout speedily, and without any particular order being followed in placing tents. The moment the sheikh has selected the spot which he intends to occupy, the Bedawins plant their lances in the ground, and, having fastened their horses to them, leave the arrangements to the women ; these hasten to their several locations, pitch their tents near their husbands' horses, and prepare the evening meaL When the sheep, goats. See., afrive, they are placed .round the tents to which they belong, and the encampment is complete. Although one of theseCHAP. XXV.] A RETREAT. Qg5 camps covers a considerable space, especially when the scanti- a ca m p in the ness ot the pasture renders it necessary to pitch the tents at considerable distances from one another, it is often difficult, found - in the wide desert, to find it without a special guide. While on the route, a column is rarely met with, but one may be occasionally seen on the verge of the horizon. Such is the march of an Arab tribe in peaceable times, but a movement is not unfrequently made under very different circumstances; when, for example, the tribe is pursued by one that is hostile, a long forced march is made, the flocks being left behind, and perhaps entirely abandoned. The retreat is protected by the horsemen belonging to the tribe, together with a number of mardouffs; these are camels, each carrying two armed men, who are provided with a bag of dates, another of flour, some water, and a proportion of ammunition; and they have every thing requisite for their defence. During a retreat of this kind the people sleep and take their Preparation of food without halting. In order that they may not fall from food during a their camels while sleeping, they stretch themselves at length^' on the animals, placing their feet in a bag on each side of its neck. The food is prepared by women at certain distances from one another. One, mounted on a camel loaded with wheat, continues grinding with a handmill, and passes the meal to another, who is provided with leathern water-bottles, sus pended on each side of her camel; she having prepared the paste, the latter is passed to a third female, who completes the operation by baking the bread in thin slices on a chafing-dish or portable oven, which is heated with wood and straw. This bread, with a proportion of cheese and dates, are then distri buted by her to those persons whom it is her province to feed, and the frugal meal finishes with a draught of camel's milk. The latter is drawn from the animals as they walk ; the men using for this purpose cadahs, or large wooden bowls, which are passed from one to another. For the protection of persons and property in passing the desert on commercial expeditions, merchants associate themselves together in considerable num bers, under regulations to which the different chiefs along the intended route become, less or more, parties. Such asso-686 MERCANTILE CARAVANS. [CHAP. XXV. A caravan in Arabia generally conducted by a sheikh. ciations have always been called caravans, whose lines of route extend into the interior of Africa on one side, and the distant Four kinds of steppes of Central Asia and China on the other. These caravans. caravans ar e of four kinds; in one kind, called a heavy caravan, the merchandise and persons are conveyed on ele phants, camels, dromedaries, and horses. Another and lighter description has very few elephants; in the ordinary caravan camels alone are employed; and the fourth kind, which is chiefly confined to Tartary and the bordering countries, is one in which the goods and persons are carried by horses. The term ship-caravan is applied to a number of ships which sail together on a trading voyage. In the case of the third kind of caravan, which is the most usual in Arabia, some well-known and influential sheikh engages, from different tribes, a certain number of refecks or associate^, who join him in furnishing the merchants with the means of conveying their goods from one place to another, under the protection of a necessary proportion of armed men as guards, the whole being under the chief himself, who then becomes the caravan bashi. This individual, with the assist ance of some of his immediate followers and the refecks, regu lates the hour of the movement, the direction of, and the duration of the march, the disposition of the look-out parties in front, and on the flanks ; likewise the place of encampment, and the arrangements for each night. In short, an Arab chief, in such circumstances, considers himself responsible for the well-being of the whole ; and, if attacked, he defends his charge to the utmost; he is generally able, however, by nego tiation, through the refecks, to avoid coming to extremities when threatened. The Aggiel Arabs are the most general carriers through the desert, and they are on the whole prefer able to the others, being to a certain extent on friendly terms with the two great tribes the Anizeh and the Shammar; and if the regulated contribution be previously paid at Aleppo or Damascus, safety is secured in case of meeting with either of those tribes, some one person being sent from each city with the caravan as a guarantee. It is, however, more usual for a caravan to take chance, in the hope that the extent of the The Aggiel Arabs pre ferred as protectors.CHAP.

Diction of en camel, which is laden with merchandise, carries two ,1 ' e burthe ' ! - bales of snitable weight, well protected by wax-cloth; besides these, and some few spare camels, a certain number of animals are appropriated for the tents, baggage, provisions, and water of the individuals in charge of the goods, as well as of the persons belonging to the caravan. One Arab is allotted to every two, and sometimes only to every three camels. The march generally continues from seven to ten hours, commenc ing about sunrise in winter, and in the early part of the night in summer. The whole body moves in two or three parallel lines, and, in each, a certain number of animals are united to one another by ropes, but with sufficient freedom to allow them to browse on the rhetem and other shrubs which they may find. On arriving at the destined halting-place, the Arrangments goods are placed on the ground in a circle, the Arabs assist-^ a a ce h . alting ing one another to unload the camels; and the latter, after being allowed to feed for a short time, lie down in a circle round the goods, within which last the Arabs make them selves comfortable for the night. The remainder of the camp is, however, formed without any particular order, except that it is an object to spread the tents over as little ground as pos sible, in order to diminish the probability of being discovered. Baking bread, cooking rice, &amp;c. speedily follow the halt, and, by the time night has fairly set in, nearly all the fires are extinguished. With these precautions it is rarely that a caravan is surprised during the night; and by mutual assistance, during about three-quarters of an hour at daybreak, it is again set in motion, the scouts and flankers disposing themselves so as to obtain timely notice of the approach of an enemy. With the Rate of exception of halts now and then at certain watering-places, travelling * the caravan thus proceeds day by day to the end of the journey, clearing, when in motion, about two miles and a half per hour. The necessity which every Muhammedan is under of visit ing the so-called holy cities, has given rise to special caravans, which, coming from the most distant parts, meet for this purpose in Arabia. Of the devotees, some come from India, entirely by sea, by the way of the Arabian Gulf; others come by688 pilgrims' caravans. [chap. xxv. Damascus and water, only as far as the Gulf of Persia, from whence they cross principal the country ; but Damascus and Cairo are the grand points of assembling union, the former for the pilgrims from Eastern Persia, Central Asia, &amp;c.; and the latter for those from different parts of the continent of Africa. A pasha of rank is annually appointed by the sultan to take charge of the caravan at each of those cities, and provide for the safety of the pilgrims. Men of every rank, and sometimes distinguished females, form part of such caravans. The historian El Fasy relates that the mother of Motassem Ibn Allah, 1 performed the pil grimage a. h . 631, with 120,000 camels. At an earlier period, viz., a.h . 97, 900 camels were required to transport the wardrobe only of Solyman Ibn el Malek; and, in our time, the wife of Muhammed Ali was distinguished by the magnificence of her tent, and her truly royal equipage, 500 camels being employed in carrying her baggage from Jiddah to Mekkah. 2 Caravan from Ever since the kaliphs were in the habit of accompanying it, Constantinople. ^ gy r j an b een m ore numerous than that which goes from Africa. Both are, however, regulated by the sultan's hatti-sheriff; and the branch from Constantinople, which may be considered the principal, collects in its passage through Anatolia, the pilgrims from Northern Asia. It finds at every station a karvanserai, and is protected by the different pashas while passing through the territories which they respectively govern, till 'it arrives at Damascus. Here it halts, in order to purchase provisions, and make other preparations, including the acquisition of Arabian camels, which become absolutely necessary for the accomplishment of the remainder of the journey. The rich hajji form a party by themselves, amount ing sometimes to as many as forty or fifty individuals, including females. The latter are accommodated in a shebrye or shekdof, and occasionally, for those who are wealthy, there is provided a kind of palanquin, called tack-y-van, having four long shafts, by which it may be suspended between two mules or two 1 The last of the Abassides. 2 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol. II., p. 44.CHAP. XXV.J MARCH FROM DAMASCUS. 689 camels. Few ordinary travellers undertake the journey at their own risk, or with their own camels, since this would subject them to the ill-treatment of the mekowem. The latter furnish camels, provisions, tents, and servants for some twenty or thirty individuals, who, besides the camels for their baggage, have each one with a man to lead it at night; they provide also water, coffee, breakfast and dinner, at the cost of about 200 dollars, from Damascus to Mekkah. 1 Processions through the streets of Damascus, and to the mosques, announce that these preparations have been completed, and that the pasha is about to depart. He quits Damascus by the gate of Mekkah, accompanied by the pilgrims, who bring with them, for sale, shoes, slippers, embroidered stuffs, and European goods. Cash mere shawls, and other productions of their various countries, in order to diminish the expense of the journey. The different Arrangement sections of the caravan are placed in geographical order, of the sectl0n8 ' according to the towns and provinces to which they belong, an arrangement absolutely necessary to facilitate the formation of the encampments, and to prevent disorder, especially during the night. A body of cavalry forms the advance, another is posted in the rear, to bring up stragglers, and the rest of the guards, with some field-pieces, occupy convenient intervals in the long line of people, some of whom are on foot, others on camels or horses, and who are composed of various nations and classes. The signal to march or encamp is given at the pleasure of the pasha by firing a gun. In addition to the general superin- officers in tendence of the pasha, there is an officer who takes charge of tbe the order of march whilst in motion; another is responsible for the well-being of the camp ; a third is intrusted with the arrangements for its defence, in the event of an attack by the Bedawins during the march ; a fourth takes charge of the supplies, and keeps the accounts of expenditure for the troops, &amp;c.; and a fifth is the astrologer, who makes known the lucky days and hours for the performance of any important operation. A camel bred for the purpose, being stained yellow with henna, and covered with a rich carpet, reaching 1 Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia, vol. II., pp. 6, 7.690 TRAFFIC ON THE ROUTE. [CHAP. XXV.

The marches are so regulated the marches. ^ j) amascus and Cairo caravans reach Bedr at the same time, each having spent 32 days on the road: six more days carry them to Mekkah, which they enter together; and they remain there three days, waiting for those from Baghdad, Basrah, and India; all of these usually arrive in time to march in one great body to Arafat. Manner of The necessary supplies for this concourse of people are supplies on the carried either in the manner already mentioned, or by a journey. certain number of individuals making a common stock ; but a locomotive bazar forms part of the suite, and, where there are inhabitants within a short distance of the route, milk and other supplies are brought for sale. The caravan, however, comprises many good Muslims, with whom the pilgrimage is a nominal, and trade the real object. Besides the sale of stockings, shoes, and other useful articles by the way, the camps of the Hajji, in and around Mekkah, are converted into one great mart from the moment the pilgrims have gone through the first part of the forms prescribed in approaching the ka'bah. This of itself secures the envied title of Hajji; but a visit to Arafat, in the manner already described, becomes necessary to complete the pilgrimage; and, although not enjoined, it is considered meritorious to extend it to Medina. Into this country the arts and sciences were early carried, and here, at a time when Europe was sunk in barbarism, they were carefully fostered by the wealth and power of the sove reign. During the reigns of the Khaliphs, Bagdad, Cairo, Basrah, Cufa, Orfa, Aleppo, Damascus, Alexandria, and almost every other city of note not only possessed a collegiate establishment, but also contained a number of learned men, who formed the most distinguished part of the community; and the seats of government became the resort of poets, astro logers, astronomers, and philosophers, from all parts of theCHAP. XXV.] SCIENCES OF ANCIENT ARABIA. 691 world. Some few of tlie ancient collegiate establishments are Astronomy still nominally in existence, as well as a portion of the public cuiSatJd libraries. These, and some inferior schools attached to the principal mosques, are, however, all that remain of the splendid establishments of A1 Mamoun, the Augustus of Arabian literature; and scarcely the feeblest trace of former knowledge is any where to be met with amongst the present inhabitants of the country, while the gigantic strides which have been made in Europe are either totally unknown, or are felt to be quite beyond their grasp. In no branch of science is the decline so remarkable as in astronomy. Observations of the heavenly bodies continued, probably, to be made in the country from the times of the ancient Chaldeans; and, on the establishment of the throne of the Khalifs at Baghdad, by the employment of superior instruments, the values of several important elements were determined with considerable accuracy. Among these are the obliquity of the ecliptic, the precession of the equinoxes, the length of the year, and the excentricitv of the solar orbit. By the orders of A1 Mamoun, Trigonometry r- .-ifi i i/nr improved by a degree of a great circle of the earth was measured at uuia, the Arabs, and another at Rakkah ; and the mathematician Albatani made considerable improvements in trigonometry; while, to the labours of Moorish or Arabian astronomers at Cordova and Seville is due the introduction of astronomy in Europe. In Arabia, at present, an astronomical observer is unknown, and the science is reduced to the formation of rude almanacs, for purposes connected with astrology. Every branch of natural science is in an equally low state. Presen^tate^ At one time Arabia could boast of the great physicians A1 e 1116 lca Razi, and Abdallah ibn Sina, the latter of whom enjoyed the title of prince of physicians ; l but the healing art in that country is now reduced to the preparation of a few of the very simplest medicaments, almost entirely from vegetables. In surgery they only practice outward applications, such as cata plasms; and they bleed either with a knife or a large crooked needle. Inoculation for the small-pox has been long in use. 1 Arabic MS., 1357, in the British Museum. 4 T 2692 SCIENCES AND ARTS OP ARABIA. [CHAP. XXV.

The apothecary, called as szandala, 2 was made responsible that his drugs were genuine, and sold at reasonable prices ; and a knowledge of botany and chemistry, with the art of pre paring medicines, were stated to be qualifications necessary to a physician. To these, however, was added skill in astrology. Authors of Besides astronomy and medicine, the ancient Arabs were scienceand skilled in mathematics and the mechanical arts. Ibn A1 Hai- art ' tama produced a work on geometry. 3 Muhammed Ben Maruf another on horology, which included descriptions of solar dials, and both sand and water clocks. 4 And Ahil Az Ismael A1 Jezireh described the art of manufacturing astrolabes, quadrants and other mathematical instruments. The use of numerals came to us from the East, through the intervention of the Arabs, to whom we are also indebted for the arts of preparing superior steel, dressing leather, and dying with indigo. Finally, in addition to the work of Abu Bekr Ben W akshia, 5 on agriculture, there have been some valuable trea tises in Arabic, on the management of cattle, and the cultiva tion of rice. In the times of the Khalifs the Arabs are said to have been acquainted with a species of compass. 6 Among 1 Arabic MS. in the British Museum, translated by Dr. Aloys Sprenger. 4 Ibid., 735T. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid. 6 Ba'ilak Hibdjaki describes a rude compass, consisting of two cross piecesCHAP.

These last, in addition to a school are, as we have seen, still part of the establishment of a mosque; and, besides these schools, there are madressehs (colleges) in the large towns. In the former seminaries an ordinary education is given in Education in grammar, rhetoric, and poetry; the main object of study is, Arabia - however, the Koran, the higher branches of education being confined to the colleges, in which are taught, it is said, history, biography, statistics, philosophy, metaphysics, and eloquence. Scimitars, javelins, hatchets, knives, &amp;c., are enumerated by Trades Arrian, 2 as articles of trade among the Sabeans, whose country ArabTa. 1 in was also celebrated for the manufacture of armour inlaid with gold. This last kind of manufacture no longer exists; even the steel of Damascus, Baghdad, and Yemen is now but little better than that of other places, and the artists of Arabia are now reduced to a few gold and silver smiths, engravers, and gunsmiths. Besides those who follow the occupations of carpenters, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, shoe makers, saddlers, and boat-builders, there are many Arabs who employ themselves in making tents, rough carpets, large bags of camel's hair, or articles of mixed silk and cotton. By way of reproach, the Bedawins designate the towns'- vanity of the people and cultivators, ahl el madar (dwellers in houses of clay, or in the rocks); themselves being in everything con nected with civilization far behind the fixed inhabitants. Very few of them can either read or write; but their wants being few, they do not feel the lowness of their condition; whilst their vanity suggests that their race is the first on the earth. The Bedawins, however, have a thorough knowledge, of all that concerns the breed and care of animals, and they are adepts in hawking and hunting; indeed, almost every great sheikh has a number of hawks, and a pair of fine Mace donian greyhounds, for running down the gazelle. of wood floating in a bowl of water, by which ( a h . 640) a vessel was guided from the coast of Syria to Alexandria. 1 See above, p. 252-265. 2 Periplus mans Erythraei.694 PERSONAL QUALITIES [CHAP.

He is also capable of enduring great fatigue, and many privations. Character of It is difficult to imagine any contrast more striking than the Bedawms. which i s presented by the Bedawin in a town, and the same man when breathing the air of the desert. In the latter case, although indifferent to the beauties of nature, his spirits become elevated; the indolence and silence which charac terizes him in a town is exchanged for the highest degree of animation; and he indulges his lively imagination in in venting or relating tales, and at intervals, on a journey, screaming out some wild song, which, however agreeable to himself, and encouraging to his camel, is any thing but harmonious to a stranger. His cheerful disposition, his frugal repasts, and an active, hardy life, are well calculated to secure the best possible state of health, with unimpaired faculties, till an advanced age; his quickness of sight and hearing are scarcely exceeded by those of the North American Facuityof Indians, and the habits of an erratic life have taught him to steps'*' ^ trace the footsteps of any particular individual or animal. This singular power is called kiafat, or athr, according to Burckhardt, and is said to be more particularly possessed by the tribe of Modlij. 1 An Arab has been known to trace the footsteps of his camel for six days along a sandy valley, which had been crossed in every direction by thousands of other footsteps, and also to name every individual who had passed. 2 He is accustomed also, by placing the mark of his foot at a certain spot, in a particular direction, to make known to his friends that he has been there, and also the route he has taken. 3 His tact enables him to find his way across the desert independently of the compass, which is rarely used by him on land. Ludovicus Bertrommanus, however, men tions that his pilot or guide used a compass, when taking him 1 Arabic MS., 7354, in the British Museum. 2 Burckhardt's Wahhdbi and Bedawin, p. 212. 3 Ibid.CHAP.

It is customary de8ert - with the Arabs to raise small heaps of stones at certain places in the wilderness, to enable them to recognise their situation; and this is also done in order that they may distinguish one reach of a river from another, when there happens to be nothing else of a marked character on the ground. Their confidence in the correctness of their movements is greatly diminished at night, when they cannot distinguish the small differences in the localities ; but during the day they travel to the well or place of encampment with sufficient precision. Those who have had occasion to avail themselves extensively of the services of the Arabs, will readily acknowledge that they are rarely, if ever, mistaken in the general direction of any place in the wilderness ; in fact, a messenger can at any time be found to carry a letter across the desert, from Damascus or Aleppo to Baghdad or Basrah. For such a journey the messenger sets out with no other provision than a bag of dates, and a little water. The Arab people are of two distinct classes, the fixed and Prejudices less .-i r strong among the nomadic, the latter being the most numerous; the former the people of class includes the inhabitants living in the towns bordering the coast upon the river Euphrates, the western shores of the Persian Gulf, 'Oman, &amp;c. There are some also in Arabia Petreea, and near, or upon the western coast of the Peninsula. The people of the towns on this coast are not free from pride and prejudice; but the latter has been much diminished among them by their commercial intercourse with the people of Europe. They appear to be industrious and temperate, and are not addicted to piracy. Their skill in navigation is, however, very small, and they are only able to carry on a coasting trade. Their neighbours in Yemen are remarkable for a greater degree of vivacity, and they evince a sociable and commercial disposition. . The hardy mariners of Abothubee, and the adjoining territory were once strongly addicted to piracy, and the 1 Purchas' Pilgrims, vol. V., b. ii., p. 226.696 CHARACTER OF THE ANCIENT ARABS. |~CHAP. XXV. unfortunate crews of ships which, were taken, were often com pelled by them to ' walk the plank but the activity of the English cruisers has happily put a stop to such practices, and has compelled the people to apply themselves, for their subsistence, to the pearl-fishery and commerce ; so that, now, the navigation along the coasts of Arabia and Persia is liable only to the usual dangers of the seas. Some portion of the people on the western side of the Persian Gulf came, at a period not very distant, from the opposite coast; and, in consequence, the inhabitants of that part of Arabia resemble the Persians in some respects ; whilst the inhabitants of the towns along the river Euphrates are an unmixed race. But, in all, we cannot fail to recognise the branches from that wild stock whose hand is against every man. The character given of the Arabs by Ammianus Marcellinus scarcely differs from that which is indicated in the Scriptures. That writer describes them as a people who are to be desired neither as friends nor enemies ; who are not governed by any laws, nor subject to any kind of restraint; they are compared to ravenous kites snatching up their prey in their flight, but not tarrying if it requires time to carry it off. and by Edrisi. A later writer, speaking of the Bili, an African branch, says these Arabs are capable of all kinds of guilty actions; they are greedy, faithless, sanguinary, and of depraved manners. If vanquished, they disperse; and if victorious, they show no mercy. They have no respect for religion ; and, although punished by the Almighty with various calamities and infirmities, they do not profit by them. 1 Manner of Among the Bedawins war is commenced on almost any troops for war. grounds; but the most frequent cause is some quarrel con cerning water and pasture. 2 In order to collect the warriors when several tribes combine together to make war, a young maiden dressed in black, having her face and hands stained of the same colour, and being seated on a she-camel, blackened for the purpose with smoke and oil, proceeds from one tribe 1 Edrisi, ed.

XXV.] MANNER OF MAKING WAR. 697 to another, calling on the people to recruit, and assemble at an appointed place. A brief message of war and defiance is at the same time sent to the intended enemy, and the latter generally meets it in the same tone and spirit. But in the Preliminaries unusual event of a pacific answer being returned, preliminaries of peace ' are, after long discussions, settled, and generally a marriage follows. This is called hasnat, and, on such occasions, each chief kisses the blade of his adversary's sabre; after which, seven stones are put into a hole made in the ground with a lance, as a token that the hitherto hostile parties have buried their discord for ever. The tactics of war among the Arabs consist only of Attacks made manoeuvres to surprise, and, if possible, disperse the enemy, h7 8urprise ' With the exception of the Shammar tribe, however, all consider an attack by surprise as fair only when made during daylight: the excursions are predatory, being directed upon some weak point to carry off part or all of the flocks as booty, which is shared with those who are left to guard the camp. On the other hand, the friends of those who have suffered never fail to contribute towards the reparation of the loss. 1 The warriors being mounted on horses or light camels, the movements are made with rapidity; and consequently the most vigilant circumspection is necessary on the part of the menaced tribe to avert the danger. In addition to the ordinary precautions, four scouts are sent out occasionally, in different directions, who, applying their ears close to the ground, are able to distinguish the approach of a body of men at a considerable distance. In these forays the capture of a mare is considered as a great achievement, and, when these animals are surrendered in battle, the lives of the owners are spared agreeably to Arab custom; but prisoners of war are Treatment of generally stripped of their clothes, put in irons, and other- P r,soners ' wise harshly used, till an exorbitant price is paid for their ransom; this is also the fate of a whole tribe, when it falls into the power of one which is stronger.

Even the sacred rights of hospitality have been violated by him when the property of his guest has excited his cupidity. Plunder and revenge are, in fact, the governing principles of the Bedawm, and to these tend alike his habits and education ; even the life of the offender does not always suffice to atone for an injury, the members of his family, or the leading members of his tribe, being often made to suffer with him. Moderation Amongst the better qualities of the Arab, one of the first raric^of the places belongs to hospitality, which, without hesitation, is Arabs - extended to every acquaintance, and, during a truce, even to an enemy. The individual in whose favour this virtue is exercised becomes part of the family of his host, and the latter will often defend his life at the expense of his own. The Arab is, in general, justly entitled to the character of being both faithful and generous; and often in entertain ments and deeds of beneficence, he practises the most profuse liberality. His knowledge of mankind is derived merely from the observations which he is able to make on the persons with whom he happens to be brought in contact. He is moderate in his diet, and he seldom displays the unseemly workings of anger, although he is not by any means deficient in feeling. A few kind words go very far toward appeasing his anger; for he is in the main kind-hearted, willing to be useful in his way, and, above all, remarkable for his extraordinary patience and resignation under every kind of trial and disappointment. He is besides altogether content with his lot in life; and, even when poor, he readily slaughters a kid on the arrival of a stranger at his tent. 1 1 Burckhardt's Bedawin and Wahhabi, p. 141.CHAP. XXV.] TRAITS OF BENEVOLENCE. 699 The Bedawin Arabs are witty, sagacious, cheerful, and of The female sex a very jocose disposition; 1 they are fond of a good meal, TeCawiL particularly when given by another, and they frequently meet at the dwelling of the sheikh, in order to enjoy one, or to listen to music and recitations. They seem to be almost indifferent to religion, even the forms of the Muhammedan worship being disregarded by them. They live in harmony with the Hebrews, and are not decidedly hostile to Chris tianity. They are very indulgent to their children, particu larly to the boys, who are permitted not only to sit with the men, but even take part in the conversation. The female sex is much respected by them f they even tolerate, in their wives, a difference of religion, and, generally, the Bedawin women enjoy more freedom than any others in the East. The reputation of the Bedawins for liberality, kindness. Liberality and and a strict attention to their engagements, is attested by Bedawim. the many travellers; among others, by Mr. Griffiths, 3 and Colonel Capper. The latter relates an instance of politeness and liberality that would have done honour to the most polished European. 4 Burckhardt relates of two Arabs a circumstance which almost throws the deed of the good Sama ritan into the shade. The companion of a Bedawin, whilst travelling, being attacked with the small-pox, the latter built for him a hut, attended him as a nurse till he recovered, and daily solicited alms for their common support. The Bedawin was then taken ill of the same malady, and unfortunately died; but, while living, he experienced the like attention from the man whose life he had saved. 5 A Bedawin enters slowly and reluctantly into any engage ment for the performance of a service; but, the terms being settled, the performance of his part may be considered certain. It is well known that the Bedawins habitually transport 1 Burckhardt's Bedawin and Wahhdbi, p. 208. 2 Ibid., p. 81. 3 Travels in Arabia, p. 386. 4 Passage to India, by Colonel James Capper.

Arabs valuable goods belonging to merchants from the different sea- gZd teeasure. ports to Damascus and Aleppo, and from those cities across the desert, under a guard of their own people. In the narrative of the Expedition, it will be seen, that stores of all kinds, including ammunition and fire-arms, and supplies of cash, amounting on the whole to several thousand pounds, were transported by Arabs from the estuary of the Orontes, and from Aleppo to the river Euphrates; and, although they were accompanied by only one or two Europeans, and some times by none, they took no advantage of the circumstance to appropriate to themselves any part of the treasure. Agreeably to custom, the Arabs were generally paid in advance; but the money was faithfully returned when the local authorities prevented the fulfilment of their engagement, and in every instance the contracts into which they entered were performed with the utmost fidelity. Good and evil Some writers have ascribed to the Arabs every vice which SmractCT their disgraces human nature; while they have acknowledged in them very few of the virtues which ennoble it; and others, by dwelling too largely on their virtues, have fallen into the opposite extreme. Both parties appear to be equally wide of the truth, and it may be more justly asserted that, in the character of this people, good and evil nearly equally prevail. It has, at least, been the lot of the writer of this work to witness, in the Arabs, the extremes of both these qualities during the voyage down the Euphrates, as well as during the extensive journeys which he had previously made among them. END OF VOL. I.APPENDIX.n0, ,r *j appendix. 725 No. II. Abstract of a Report on the Natural History of the neighbourhood of Bir, on the Euphrates, presented to Colonel Chesney, R.A., F.R .S., &amp;c., by Mr. Ainsworth. Dr. Helper , a German naturalist of considerable attainments, and who joined the expedition at Bir on his way to explore central Afghanistan, exerted himself greatly in illustrating the natural history of the environs of that town and of Port William. It is to be regretted, however, that the time of his residence was limited to the most unfavourable season of the year —the last months of summer, when the country is subject to a burning sun and want of rain, and the winter, when the cold is prejudicial to the develop ment of animal and vegetable life. Scarcely had the spring commenced when the steam-boats departed on the voyage. During his stay Dr. Heifer, nevertheless, found means to make a large collection of objects of natural history, and several important discoveries. He found that the larger mammalia were neither abundant nor easily ap proached : he satisfied himself of the existence of the Canis lycaon or black wolf in the Sadjour, and of two sorts of foxes; the most common was the Canis corsa, the Isatis of Buffon. The Mustela of the plains he opines to be M. Sarmatica. He ascertained the existence, in the same neighbourhood, of the common leopard, the Felis chalybeata and the F. caracal. The domestic mouse he found to be a new species; the common hare, so frequent at Amelia depot, was seldom observed, and the rabbit was quite wanting. He remarked that the bats belonged to the genera Rhinolophus and Nycteris. The Erina- ceus auritus was observed by Dr. Heifer at Aleppo, and Mr. Ainsworth noticed it at Hawan in Mesopotamia: a species of Talpa in the possession of the latter gentleman is new. The wolf and the jackal are common, but the hyena is met with only on the Amanus. The Hystrix was observed at Bir, and it is most common in shaded rocky places, as at Seleucia Pieria. The Caucasian goat is met with in the Taurus, and a beautiful variety of the com mon goat of the country attracted general attention. Dr. Heifer found the horns of the Ovis ammon in a house at Azass : the sheep are the large-tailed variety which is common in Southern Russia. The collection of birds made at Port William and at other stations contains several undescribed species: the type, however, is decidedly European. The summer birds depart in October, and the winter birds do not remain long- The species belonging to the class of Accipitres are very common in the East. A specimen of the Vultur percnopterus was kept some time at the house at 5 b726 APPENDIX. [N o - II. Antioch : it is less common at Bir than at the latter town or at Aleppo. The Vultur fulvus is also occasionally met with. The genus Falco is much used for hunting, and several undescribed species were observed. One solitary owl was frequently seen among rocks and ruins ; and Dr. Heifer considers it as the Strix Uralensis. Among the Passeres are three species of Muscicapa, the Ampelis garrulus or fallax. The Edolius is probably accidental. The Turdus saxatilis was noticed in the gardens of Bir : there are also many Mota- cillce. Of the Alaudce there are five species, one of which is new : the Par us major and P. ater are observed ; and the Regulus is a bird of passage. There are also many Fringillce ; and the common sparrow follows man even into his dwelling-place. All the European species of Corand some which are new, are there. The genus Alcedo furnished three species, and none of them are European. Among the Gallinacece a single Lagopus was shot by Colonel Chesney. The Tetrao francolinus was met with, but is not so abundant as in the plains of Jilwan. Among the partridges are the Perdix cinerea, P. rufa and P. Grceca ; and of pigeons there were several kinds. In the rocks was found the Columba livia. The Grallatores furnish the Otis tarda, and there are many species of Charadrius and Tringa. The Ibex religiosa, which was not observed at Port William, was found by Mr. Ainsworth to build in a few solitary trees at Serug, in Mesopotamia. At the former place the Machetes pugnax, as well as the Scolopax rusticola and Gallinula, was common. The Euphrates furnished the Fulica porphyria and a few Palmipedes, among which the Anser procellarius, A. larus, and the Pelicanus onocrotalus. The Anser Nubica is found breeding between Port William and Biles. Several interesting species belonging to the class of reptiles have been obtained. The plains furnished two species of tortoise, one of which resembles T. Grceca, but is new. The Orontes furnished us with one species of Trionyx which, if not the Trionyx Euphratica, is a new species ; it was discovered by Colonel Chesney. The Euphrates has afforded, besides the Trionyx to which Olivier first gave a name, two species of Emys. Of Lacertince the plains have afforded three species, and other localities seven additional ones. Old ruins gave three species of Gecko. The chame leon, frequent in the valley of Antioch, is not met with at Port William. The family of Ophidia is numerous. Three species of Coluber were the only poisonous ones. At Port William no snakes exceeding a length of three feet were met with, but in the close, hot, and humid climate of Mourad Pasha, a marsh pent up between mountains, they were found exceeding six feet in length. Seven species of Batrachia have been collected. The dry months did not afford an abundant harvest of insects. The species belonged almost entirely to the families Orthoptera and Hymenoptera, prin- cipally some Truxales, Locusta and Acridii, with some striped Lepidopterce. There were also some Pimelice, two of them very abundant. At the same season the tents at Mourad Pasha were over run by a Scolopendra, a species differing from the African, and attaining a length exceeding three inches. A fortnight after the rains came on Dr. Heifer had already obtained two hundred species of Coleoptera. Among these are many genera which haven 0 - ii.] appendix. 727 been exclusively supposed to belong to the temperate and northern parts of Europe, or which have only some representatives in southern regions. Such are the brachelytrous beetles, of which seven hundred species be long to Britain, and of which forty were found in North Syria. Of the Pselaphi five species were found. Insects that live much upon plants, it might naturally be expected, are not numerous; but the Curculionides amount to sixty species, and there are many Melascince. Coccinellce in abun dance. Chrysomela not so numerous. The genus Carabus, as a type, only afforded one species, C. Hemprichii. The Scarabidce only furnished two species; and of the Lamellicornes there were but few. 5 b 2728 appendix. [no- iii. No. III. WILD ANIMALS OF ARABIA AND MESOPOTAMIA.

The coat is yellowish gray above, and with the tail has brown rings. The Mm longipes of the same author, Gerbillus meri- dianus of Desmarest, is only a little more than four inches in length, and is associated by Cuvier with the Dipus Indicus of General Hardwicke, in which the tail is longer than the body, and like the meridianus resembles the dor mouse in size, although in point of colour it approximates more than any other species to the Gerbillm of the Euphrates. I observed one of these animals that came by its death in a curious manner. In running along a branch of a bramble bush, its tail had been caught by a spine and held fast, and having fallen in this position it was unable, from the great length of the tail, to regain its footing, and thus perished. This species lives in the marshy woods of the forests of Amran, below Racca, and on the Mesopotamian side of the Euphrates. The vegetation of these woods consists of tamarin and poplar, nearly equally distributed. Jasminia, rubus, rosa and wild mulberry less frequent, and a climbing asparagus. DOMESTIC ANIMALS.

These extraordinary birds are seen in large flocks, and it is known that they have the surprising habit of forming a kind of momentary artificial embank ment across the rivers Saggeour and Kouweik ; having for this purpose chosen the shallowest spot, they range themselves side by side in several close ranks, and sit down with their tails to the current and their feathers spread put; by this contrivance they in some degree check the course of the water, which in consequence overflows at the chosen spot, and one of the flock, pre viously placed as a sentinel a little distance from the rest, gives as a signal a cry not unlike that of the stork, but much more shrill, upon which the rest of the flock dart upon the fish, frogs, toads, &amp;c., which are then almost without water, and make a sumptuous repast of all that are thus caught.No- V.J APPENDIX. 733 No. V. REPTILES. 1 Species 1. Trionyx (or Gymnopus, according to MM. Dumt5ril and Bebron). The following description is drawn up by W. Martin, Esq. from a dried specimen, of which the sternum was unfortunately removed by the animal pre server. Total length, from the tip of the muzzle to the end of the tail, two feet; width, about one foot; head and neck, measuring to the anterior edge of the carapace, seven inches and three-quarters. Carapace slightly convex and oval, slightly truncated posteriorly ; composed of nine costal plates, the ribs being eight in number: a double mesial furrow runs along the back leaving a s lig htly convex elevation between them : between the first, and most ante rior, of these plates and the second are two depressions, each about half an inch in diameter, placed near the mesial line, and separated by a space less than a quarter of an inch in extent. The whole upper surface of the carapace, excepting at the margin, irregularly reticulate. The depressions between the costal plates are well marked. The length of the carapace is nine inches, and the breadth seven inches and three-quarters; on the sides of the body the coriaceous membrane extends about two inches beyond the lateral margins of the carapace, the ribs themselves extending about one inch and a half beyond the carapace. Towards the hinder part of the body the membrane gradually increases in width, and over the tail it had attained a width of nearly six inches, of which about two inches and a half are free. The head is in the form of an elongated triangle; the snout is considerably produced and attenuated: the width of the head,at the base is two inches and a quarter; the total length of the skull is three inches five lines ; the space from the eye to the upper lip beneath the nostrils is eleven lines ; the space between the orbits is five lines: on the vertex above and between the orbits the skull is smooth and convex. In both the fore nnd hind feet the first or front claw is the lareest. The tail is rather short and thick; its length is abont four inches and a half. When alive this animal was of an uniform mud colour, sliffhtlv tinted with olive green. __ In many respects this animal agrees with the ( Trionyx JEgy V tia*us), as described by M. Bebron, bnt neither the he«l Tte ^^fbetidt rrUr?—'depressions, ^m the anterior 0 c734 APPENDIX. part of the carapace, are not alluded to in the account of G. JEgyptiacus; they are, however, very conspicuous in the animal in question. There are, it may be added, no pellucid scales, placed in a transverse direction, on the under surface of each elbow, nor are there any depressed convex tubercles, either anteriorly or posteriorly, on the cartilaginous expansion of the cara pace, as are often, though not invariably, found in the G. JEgyptiacus. With respect to the Gymnopus Euphraticus (Trionyx Euphraticus) originally described by Olivier (Voyage en Perse, torn. iii. p. 453, tab. 41), the carapace is described as being broader behind and before, which, it reference be intended only to the osseous disc, is not the case in the present animal. As in that species, however, the circumference of the carapace is smooth, and the skin is folded at the elbow-joint, above, but does not simulate scales. The circumstance of a mesial depression, or, rather, double channel, with a convex line between, down the vertebral column, is not noticed as characteristic of the G. Euphraticus, nor are the smooth anterior oval fovese. Still, however, it is not improbable that the animal in question may be iden tical with that described by Olivier; but it remains to be seen whether his species be distinct from G. JEgyptiacus, a point which his short and imperfect account does not enable us to solve. 2. Gymnopus (undetermined). 3. Agama mutahilis. 4. Scincus cupreus. 5. Coluber Cliff or dii. 6. Coluber Chesneii (Martin). This last species is allied to Col. Hippocrepis, but differs in the shape of the muzzle (which is more acute), in the figure and extent of the nasal and labial plates, and in the disposition of the markings. The labial plates are small and numerous, and in one specimen several are divided. The posterior frontals are small, and in one specimen are divided into two. The anterior frontals are contracted. The superciliary plates are convex; the eyes are small. The scales of the trunk are small, imbricate, and without a keel. The head is pale yellowish brown, the plates beautifully freckled, or finely marbled with dark brown; a brown band traverses the superciliary and verticle plates from eye to eye, and then descends on each side obliquely to the angle of the mouth. The labial plates are bordered with dusky brown, or deep gray. The ground colour of the body above is yellowish brown; a series of square spots of a brown, or olive-brown colour, extend from the back of the neck, above the median dorsal line, to the end of the tail. On the sides of the neck begins a line of the same colour, which soon breaks into elongated narrow marks, which, towards the middle of the body, become confused, broken, and irregular.n&lt;&gt; ' v *3 appendix. 735 duly brown! 0 ' marginS 0f the aWOminal ^ are ^ ^ O Z m w 016 AO the Under SUrface of head ' bod y' and tail .

Allied to the ' Couleuvre a capu- chm, but has the muzzle much shorter and rounder; it differs also in the distribution of colours. The head is broad, the eyes very small, the muzzle very short and blunt. The head is gray, finely and closely marbled, and dotted with black; a ring of which colour encircles the neck. The ground colour of the trunk above is pale cinereous gray, barred with transverse marks of black, broadest in the middle, and having a disposition to assume the arrow-headed form; they unite with the black of the abdomen alternately, so that their direction across the back is not directly transverse, but obliquely so.

A black mark runs below the eye to the margin of the lips, and a second to the angle of the mouth ; a series of blackish spots begins on the back of the neck, and runs down the back, where they become larger, and often broken into a double alternating series ; a line of smaller and deeper black spots runs along each side, and the upper margins of the abdominal plates also are irregularly mottled with black.

A large fossa indicates, as m the aper ture of the nostrils, and within this a valve, only to be seen when the fossa is opened, stretches obliquely across, forming the posterior margin of the nasal canal, as it extends from the bottom of the fossa. The rostral plate is large and rounded above; the muzzle is larger and swollen; the eyes sunk, but are not overshadowed, as in F. elegans, by a single superciliary plate; the scales, however, which occupy its place, are somewhat larger than those covering the top of the skull between the eyes. A large elongated scale intervenes between the nasal cavity and the rostral plate. The scales between the nostrils are larger than those which succeed them; the labials are rather small, the fourth from the rostral being the largest—their number on each side is ten. The scales on the top of the head are small, keeled, subacute at the points; those of the trunk are large, flat, elongated, with round points, and narrowly keeled. Subcaudal plates 47 pairs. Body stout and robust, gradually tapering to the apex of the tail. The general colour of the upper surface is brownish gray, minutely freckled with black, the dots of which are more clustered on the sides, in some places, and at regular intervals, giving the appearance of obscure cloudedor nehulcB.

Absque squamis et integumentis duris, cute molle partes duras skeleti tegente. Partes laterales declives molles. Pedes palmati vix elongati, tribus digitis ungulatis. Nasus prolongatus probosciformis. Cauda mediocris vix retractilis. Ani foramen apertum. Specific Description. Flat, the hard skeleton prominent forward, with a declivity towards the back, and a slight carina in the middle, with bulky membranaceous lobes on the sides ; more conspicuous behind. Head and neck perfectly retractile, feet partly so, tail not at all, but entirely covered by the lobes. Skin bright, shining on the back, and smooth and plain ; but towards the sides and behind wrinkled, much more so on the head, neck, and feet; the under sides much plainer everywhere. Upwards, of a green-olive colour, with large, irregular greenish-black spots, six of which on the lobes behind assume a regular triangular form, besides others dispersed in an irregular manner, like small rice grains. The under side is everywhere of a pale yellowish, or roseate-reddish colour, whiter towards the extremities, with elevated spots, but especially on the extremities, resembling an exantheme {morhilli) in collateral ranges. On the side of the sternum a blue transversal stripe. It is 25 inches long, without the covered tail; 14 inches broad at two-thir parts towards the back, where it is largest, including the pendant lobes. The head, beginning from the neck to the end of the nose, is 4 inches long, pyramidal in shape, and ending in a small proboscis; flat upwards, behind the eyes ; in the middle, a protuberance, obsolete; between the eyes carina, obsolete, broadest near the neck. , Nose ( probosciformis) 9 inches long, and on the upper lip 5 lines broad. Mouth wide, open with two pendant and rather small lobes on the sides. The upper jaw covers the under side. . , il . Lips corneous, biu-e, and of a li«ht yellow eolour, endmg m both jaws, which are substituted for teeth ; they are very strong, and well adapted for organs of mastication. The under lip is considerably shorter.738 APPENDIX. Tongue thick, narrow, and flatter on the lower part, and divided by a small carina into two sections ; on the upper part are prominent succulent, glandulous protuberances, a blue stripe (a blood-vein) running in the middle. Neck rotund, or circular, about 5 inches in diameter behind the head. Legs turned outward, 6 inches in length, with three very strong pale yellowish, or gray-coloured claws, entirely covered when retracted with broad-webbed skin. Tail of an extraordinary strength, 7 inches long from the beginning, and ending by degrees in a point of no more than two lines in breadth ; at the beginning it is more than 3 inches broad. It lives in the Euphrates; and, on warm days, it comes on land, particularly on the sandbanks in the middle of the river, where it remains, if undisturbed, for several hours—two to five hours, or more, lying in the sun covered with mud, so that it would be some times difficult to distinguish it from the ground, if its tardy movements and a peculiar whistling noise did not discover it. The specimen here described seems to have been a full-grown one, many of a smaller size having been seen, but none larger. It was very active, strong, violent (and, against the general rule of the reptile class), extremely passionate. When turned on its back, it could easily turn again, with the help of its fore-legs, and its protracted head and neck. If a piece of wood, rope, or cloth, were placed near its mouth, it would snap after it, and, if it reached it, retract its head entirely with the object, and, with the help of its strong claws, even try to tear it to pieces. It would, if provoked, by pressing air through its nostrils, utter a sound similar to that made by some species of serpents.No- VI.] APPENDIX. 739 No. VI. NAMES OF FISH IN THE RIVER TIGRIS.

District of The territory of Mahrah properly commences where Makal- ^hrah, lah 'terminates, but the present limits of the province include a portion of Shehr, since they extend south-westward to the foot of the Sheikhawi mountains, and again north-eastward to 'Oman; the sea is on the south-east, and El Ahkaf on the north-west. The whole is, however, considered by some of the Arabian geographers as part of ancient Hadramaut, and both provinces are traversed by the prolongation of the same great chain of mountains. The capital, Dzifar, is also called Ahmedyat, from its founder Ahmed-ben-Muhammed, 1 who destroyed the town of Mediyat, on the coast. 2 and of Ainaud. In the interior is the district of Ainaud, with a capital of the same name, situated seven days from Shehr. One day from thence is the tomb of Kaktan, a celebrated place of devo tion ; at which a great fair is also held. 3 Near the coast is the town of Haseks, and a little way from the shore opposite to Sherbadhat are the Kuria Muria isles. This sterile group, five in number, viz., Hellaniyah, Soda, Jebeliyah, Karzawet, and Hasiki, appear to have been what was at one time a con tinuation of the mountains, 4 passing through Morbat and Hasik. The structure consists of ridges of granite, surmounted by a kind of trap or green stone, which, in the form of dykes, pervades the mass, and also appears in the shape of seams run ning in all directions through the granite. In Hellaniyah, the largest, the hills form a cluster of sterile peaks in the centre 1 In a.h . 610. 2 Arabic MS., 7502, in the British Museum, translated by Dr. A.

Of the four other islands which are uninhabited. Soda, the Soda, most considerable in size and elevation, is a shapeless mass of bare rock, chiefly granite, rising abruptly from the sea, about six miles to the westward. On it are the remains of a village and a few tamarisk bushes, but no inhabitants. Jebeliyah, the third, is the easternmost; it consists of two JebeUyah. or three bare rocks, rising to the height of 560 feet, and many small patches of ground, scarcely emerging from the sea ; this is the favourite resort of the gannet, 3 and other sea-birds, but no fresh water is to be found. 4 Karzawet, the fourth, the Redondo of Europeans, is of red- Karzawet. dish-coloured granite, which rises in two cones; the greater being 210 feet high. 5 Hasiki, the last and most western of the group, is about Hasiki. 13 miles from Soda and 20 from the Arabian coast It con sists of a long ridge of hills running north, with two peaks, rising to the height of 400 feet. It is chiefly of reddish granite, without fresh water, and, like Jebeliyah, covered with gannets and divers. 6 The Arabs call these islands Jezair Ben Khalfan, from a family of the great Mahri tribe who seized them. 7 According to local tradition the descendants of the rebellious tribe of A'd here maintained their ancient faith long after the rest of the peninsula had embraced the doctrines of Muhammed; but at length a pestilence swept all away except a young woman, who, being rescued by a passing Arab, became the mother of the present race. 8 1 Dr. Hulton's account of the Kuria Muria Islands, vol.
