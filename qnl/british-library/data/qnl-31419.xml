From Senior Lieutenant W. M. PENGELLEY, II. M.’s I. N., To A. KIN LOCH FORBES, Esq., Secretary to Governraent, Political Department. Muscat, 8th June 1861. Sir, I have the honour to bring to the notice of His Excellency the Honorable the Governor in Council that a few days since, in the course of conversation with Hajee Ahmed, the Wuzeer, 1 discovered that His Highness Syud Thooenee intended shortlv to despatch a warlike expedition to Sohar. 2. Observing the preparations which were being actively carried on in the harbour on board the vessels-of-war belonging to His Highness, I waited on him without loss of time, and entreated him before proceeding to extremities to exert ail the means in Ids power to prevail on his brother Syud Toorkee to resign the governor ship of Sohar, in order to avoid the disgrace of a public expulsion. I also informed him how much it would grieve the Government of India to hear of any approach to either civil war or discord in His Highness’ dominions. 3. In reply. His Highness stated that, as every pacific endeavour on his part had proved futile, and as fresh complaints of his brother's misgovernment were being made to him daily, he had at last determined no longer to submit to it, but by force of arms compel him to yield that fealty due to him alone as sovereign prince of Oman. 4. Seeing that His Highness was on this point inflexible, I wrote immediately to the British subjects residing in the town of Sohar to the effect that it would be advisable they should have their business matters so arranged as to be able to quit the place at a moment’s notice. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) W. M. PENGELLEY, British Agent at Muscat. IFrom Senior Lieutenant W. M. PENGELLE^, II. M. s I. N. t Eritisli Agent at Muscat, To A. KIN LOCH FORBES, Esq., Secretary to Government, Political Department. Muscat, \lth June 1861. Sir, I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Honorable the Governor in Council, that I received yesterday a letter, dated 25th Zilkad (5th June), from His Highness Syud Toorkee, the Governor of Sohar. 2. He complains in it of my having caused the British subjects to leave that place, and solicits that further time be allowed ere Ilis Highness Syud Thooenee should put in force any extreme measures. He likewise states that he is rejoiced to hear that the British Government has placed Sohar under Muscat. 3. In my reply I cautioned him against any attempt on his part to foment disturb ances in “ Oman,” and (quoting a portion of his own letter) requested that, as he felt happy at being placed under the dominion of Muscat, he would favour Ilis Highness o Syud ihooenec with a visit, when I hoped, after a calm and impartial discussion, the evils otherwise to be apprehended might yet be avoided. 4. It remains to be seen if His Highness will avail himself of my counsel. I fear he will not, having previously declined several invitations from his brother. 5. iho letter referred to from Syud Toorkee I gave to His Highness the Imam for perusal. Ho remarked that further delay would be extremely dangerous, and would inevitably tend to weaken his power in Oman. lie should therefore continue Ids preparations, but at the same time he sincerely trusted that his brother would follow my advice and come to Muscat. His Highness subsequently sent me a short note for Syud I oorkee to the above effect. I enclosed it in my reply which left this yesterday evening. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) W. M. PENGELLEY, British Agent at Muscat.RESOLUTION by the Honorable Board, dated \Zth August 1861. Resolved, —Lieutenant Pengelley should be informed that his proceedings generally are approved. The Honorable the Governor in Council will be glad to learn that the British Agent has been able to effect an accommodation between the Sultan of Muscat and Syud Toorkee. Copies of these letters should be forwarded to the Government of India in conti nuation of previous correspondence.( 4 ) No. 29 of 1861. From Senior Lieutenant W. M. PENGELLEY, H. M.’s L N., British Agent at Muscat, To A. KINLOCH FORBES, Esq., Secretary to Government, Political Department. Sir, Dated Seeb, near Muscat, 6th July 1861. / In continuation of my letter to Government, No. 25, of the 11th ultimo, I have the honour to report that Ills Highness Syuil Toorkee, of Sohar, in compliance with my request, consented to an interview with Ilis Highness Syucl Thooenee, on condition that the conference should not be held at the Court of Muscat. 2. I reported this to the Sultan, who declined holding any personal communication with SyudToorkee, save at the capital, which decision I madeknown to thelatter forthwith. 3. Having yet some hope of effecting a meeting between the brothers, and settling amicably their unhappy differences, I left for Seeb (a town on the coast, about twenty-five miles north of Muscat), and wrote to Syud Toorkee that it would afford me pleasure to receive him should he honour me with a visit, my object being to ascertain if he was able to refute any of the serious charges of rebellion and gross misgovernment preferred against him by his brother. 4. In reply to my letter from Seeb, Syud Toorkee stated that he would he happy to visit me, provided I would furnish him with an “ aman,” or pledge of security for his safe return to Sohar. I informed him it was beyond my power to do so, but that I would write to the Sultan on the matter. This I at once did, and His Highness with his usual urbanity replied, that any “ aman ” I .granted should be considered as valid, and be treated with the same respect as if coming direct from himself. 5. I despatched therefore to Sohar the required document, purporting that I “ agreed to be responsible for the safety of Ilis Highness Syud Toorkee from Sohar to Seeb, and during such time as might be necessary in attending a conference with me as British Agent.” 6. On the 4th instant I was pleased at receiving a note from Syud Toorkee written on board a “ buggalow” off Seeb, and mentioning the hour he purposed landing. I at once despatched a messenger to Muscat with a letter to the Sultan, soliciting the favour of His Highness’ presence, as SyudToorkee had visited me at my request and on my per sonal responsibility. I added also that I hoped His Highness would not fail to attend, as the Indian Government would then be aware that every endeavour had been made on bis part to preserve his country from the innumerable troubles originating from civil dissension. 7. On the afternoon of the 4th, Syud Toorkee called, accompanied by about thirty armed followers. Not a word had he to say in extenuation of his conduct. He merely bc^ed that, in the name of the British Government, I would entreat hisI ( 5 ) forgiveness. ITaving intimated to His Highness that I would make no promises, he returned on board, with the full understanding he was to he present the following day at 3 r.M., at which hour I informed him there was some prospect of meeting his brother. 8. About noon of the 5th, His Highness Thooenee arrived from Muscat, escorted by 200 cavalry and one 12-pr. howitzer. I wrote off to Syud Toorkee, saying that he must not fail to keep his appointment, as his brother the Sultan had condescended to come from his capital for the express purpose of affording him an audience. 9. Being fully alive to the significancy of this conference, of the importance attaching to its result, and of the absolute necessity there should be no misunderstand- ing, yet fearing the possibility of being wilfully misapprehended or making matters worse than before did I trust entirely to my imperfect acquaintance with the colloquial, I deemed it prudent to put a curt question or two to the brothers in writing, which it would be impossible for either of them to misunderstand. With this view, I had sent to Syud Toorkee a copy of the few words I intended to address him, and to which I said I expected a favourable reply, adding that, unless he was prepared to do so, he had better return to Sohar with all despatch, as I would not be answerable for his safety. In reply, he sent word to say that he fully agreed to my plan, was deeply thankful to me for the trouble I had taken, and that he intended to humble himself before his brother more than I even required of him. 10. I read to the Sultan the question I intended putting to him. He said he was ever ready to listen to anything Syud Toorkee might have to say, and that, provided he sued for pardon, and gave some security for his future line of conduct, he would consent to any reasonable terms I might propose. Yet he feared Syud Toorkee’s removal from Sohar was incumbent, as he would never prove a loyal subject, and the country would continue in its present state of anarchy. 11. At 3 p. m., instead of His Highness Syud Toorkee making his appearance, I received a note from him stating that the day was too fir advanced to commence business, and suggesting that the interview be deferred until the following morning. 12. It being evident that Syud Toorkee was seriously alarmed, and that he probably designed sailing for Sohar during the night, I sent him a verbal reply to the elfect that, as for such a trivial reason he had failed in his attendance, I considered my duty as a mediator to have thereby terminated. 13. His Highness Syud Thooenee then very courteously asked me if I was of opinion he was now at liberty to arrest his brother. I replied that, as Syud Toorkee had broken faitb with me, he was no longer under the protection of my “ aman, ” and could of course be dealt with precisely as any other of His Highness’ subjects. 14. The buggalow with Syud Toorkee and his followers on hoard was shortly after taken possession of, and escorted to Muscat by two of the Sultan’s armed “ buteels.” 15. His Highness Svud Thooenee and retinue returned to Muscat the followimr morning. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) W. M. BENGELLEY, British Agent at Muscat, m .ii( 6 ) No. 30 of 1861. From Senior Lieutenant W. M. PENGELLEY, H. M.’s I. N., British Agent at Muscat, To A. K1NLOCH FORBES, Esq., Acting Secretary to Government, Political Department. Dated Seel, llth July 1861. Sir, Intelligence having been received from Sohar that the soldiers of the town, and many disaffected people of the district, highly incensed at the capture of their Chief, had determined to reject by force of arms any ruler delegated by Syud Thooenee, I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Honorable the Governor in Council, that on the 9th instant His Highness despatched from Muscat “ Rahmany”.. .. “ Caroline” .... “Curlew” (brig) 24 guns. “Curlew” (brig) !!! ^4 ” anc ^ or Burka, and there to await his presence. 4 = guns ' arrived on the 12th idem. 3. Though on the march he did not fail to pay me a short visit, and acquainted me with the particulars of the subject briefly stated above, His Highness appeared confident that all would terminate satisfactorily, a$, now that the people of Sohar were without a leader, he apprehended but slight difficulty in adjusting minor differences, and establishing on a firm footing peace and prosperity throughout that portion of his hitherto misgoverned territory. 4. In the hope of facilitating this laudable design, and of avoiding the slightest approach to a rupture, I despatched a letter addressed “ to the soldiers and inhabitants of Sohar,” commanding them, in the name of the British Government, to abstain from any acts of rebellion, and as loyal subjects to submit for the future to the mild and impartial rule of His Highness Syud Thooenee. 5. Seeing the necessity of keeping myself in easy communication with Sohar, I purpose, at the desire of His Highness, to quit this for Burka to-morrow, and remain there until matters assume a more tranquil aspect, when it is my intention imme diately to return to Muscat. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) W. M. PENGELLEY. British Agent at Muscat.( 7 ) No. 31 of 1861. From Senior Lieutenant W. M. PENGELLEY, H. M.’s I. N., British Agent at Muscat, To A. KINLOCH FORBES, Esq., Acting Secretary to Government, Political Department. Dated Seeb, 17th July 1861. Sir, I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Honorable the Governor in Council, that His Highness Syud Toorkee is imprisoned in one of the forts of Muscat, and his household, having quitted Sohar, voluntarily share with him his confinement. 2. Should Government see no objection, I would most respectfully beg to suggest that a letter be despatched to His Highness Syud Thooenee, requesting that, in memory of his father (the late Syud Saeed bin Sultan bin Ahmed), a suitable monthly allowance as 4 ‘ subsistence money ” (say from four to five hundred dollars) be granted to his brother during his natural life, or so long as he shall remain faithful to the dominion of His Highness. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) W. M. PENGELLEY, British Agent at Muscat. No 32 of 1861. From Senior Lieutenant W. M. PENGELLEY, H. M.’s I. N., British Agent at Muscat, To A. KINLOCH FORBES, Esq., Acting Secretary to Government, Political Department. Sir, JBurJca, 30th July 1861. I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, my arrival at Burka on the night of the 18th instant. 2. His Highness Syud Thooenee embarked on board the Corvette Rahma?iy on the morning of the 15th, and in company with his squadron sailed for Sohar about noon of the same day. 3. A thousand men (cavalry and infantry) inarched from Burka for the purpose of co-operating with the vessels-of-war, should it be found necessary. I*( 8 ) 4. On the arrival of the force at Sohar, the town, 1 have been informed, was found entirely deserted, the inhabitants having fled into the interior. The guns were loaded and forts manned; but in obedience to a summons from His Highness, the gates were thrown open, and his troops assumed quiet possession. 5. Syud Thooenee, after remaining at Sohar until the 24th instant, returned by land, arriving here on the morning of the 26th idem. 6. The day following I paid a visit to His Highness. I cordially congratulated him on the well planned operations which had been instrumental in effecting a speedy and bloodless termination of an expedition against which resistance only could have been anticipated. 7. His Highness informed me he had appointed his eldest son, Syud Salim (about 22 years of age), governor of the town and district of Sohar. r Aware that he was unable either to read or write, I expressed to Syud Thooeneo my doubts as to his son’s competency for such a very important position. His Highness assured me he had taken great care that Syud Salim’s advisers were men of wisdom and experience, and fully to be relied on ; so much so, that he now felt relieved from all anxiety, being confident that the jurisdiction over that portion of his territory would, for the future, be con ducted in an even and creditable manner. 8. The respectable inhabitants of Muscat, without exception, speak well of His Highness Syud Salim. Judging, however, from his appearance, and from the conversa tions I have held with him, I am of opinion he is by no means superior in intelligence to Syud Toorkee; yet as the former unquestionably takes after his father in disposi tion, it is probable that he may, under good advice, yet become a credit to his country.

I have the honour to report, for the information of the Honorable the Governor in Council, the arrival from Bombay of Her Majesty’s Sloop-of-war Elphimtone. 2. Hearing at Muscat of my absence on duty. Lieutenant Etheridge, Indian Navy, commanding the above named vessel, anchored off Burka, and delivered the Government despatches, as acknowledged in my letter No. 36, of yesterday’s date. 2 pV I ( 9 ) 3. Deeming it expedient not to let pass so favourable an opportunity ot \isiting Sohar, and making myself personally acquainted with Syud Salim s advisers, w ith a view, moreover, of administering to them a few salutary words for their guidance, with reference to their future policy, and being now able to do so with some effect, I leave this at daylight to-morrow in His Highness ship the Caroline, and incompan) with the* Elphinstone. 4. Subsequent to an exchange of salutes between the Elphinstone and the Fort, I had the honour of introducing Lieutenant Etheridge to His Highness. The latter expressed extreme satisfaction at the prospect of an English vessel-of-war visiting Sohar at this eventful period. 5. In conclusion, I have the pleasure of stating that the voice of the public (with but rare exceptions) appears greatly in favour of the recent changes which have been effected in the government of this country; also that general tranquillity prevails throughout Muscat and its dependencies.

Your arrival here is most opportune, and I have the honour to request you will (Jo mo the favour of visiting the town of Sohar, on the Battnah coast, in the \essel under your command. 2. The object I have in view in making the above request is, that you will be good enough to co-operate with me in assuring His Highness Syud Salim, the newly appointed governor, that, so long as he may conduct himself satisfactoiily, and lemain loyal to the rule of his father the Sultan, he will invariably be countenanced and meet with support ;but should he, on the contrary, endeavour at any time to foment disturb ances, or create dissension amongst the Chiefs of the various tribes in his immediate neighbourhood, he will undoubtedly incur the grave displeasure of the British Government.

KINLOCH FORBES, Esq., Acting Secretary to Government, Political Department. Sir, Dated Muscat, 26th August 1861. With reference to paragraph 3 of my letter to Government, No. 37, of 3rd August, I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Honorable the Governor in Council, my arrival at Sohar per His Highness’ frigate Caroline. 2. I at once did myself the honour of calling on His Highness Syud Salim, with the view of instituting a few inquiries into the present condition of the town and neigh bouring district of Sohar, in the execution of which duty, I have the pleasure to state not only that every facility was afforded me, but that the relevant replies I received evinced a degree of candour and confidence on the part of Syud Salim beyond that which I was prepared to anticipate.( 11 ) 3. His Highness, in the discharge of his duties, has the assistance of four advisers, nominated by Syud Thooenee—first, Seyf bin Suliman, now “ waly of Sohar (late “ waly” of Salim and Khaboorah); second, Syud Hamed bin Ahmed bin Imam ; third, Syud Yaharoob bin Khatitain, and fourth, Syud Ali bin Sala. 4. It is with much regret I report that Sohar presented the appearance of having withstood a siege. ?sot a bouse but what was injured to the extent of doois being wrenched oft’and windows removed, and the scorched remains of buildings in open spaces of several hundred square yards bore silent testimony to the work of incendiarism. 5. The town, which is about two miles in circumference, is built close and facing the beach. It is encircled on three sides by a broad entrenchment, and a wall flanked by round towers, in which are mounted a few old-fashioned honey-combed guns of light calibre. The principal fort, which is likewise the residence of His Highness, is situated nearly in the centre, and is about the only building intact and presenting the appearance of solidity. It is a largo irregularly-constructed pile, 72 feet in height, with thick walls, and by far the strongest specimen of architecture to be seen in this part of Arabia; although in some places, for want of repair, it is fast crumbling to decay, yet the portions available either for offensive or defensive warfare, I observed, were sound, and in a serviceable condition. 6. At present there are scarcely above five hundred inhabitants in the whole of the town ; but as confidence is rapidly returning, the people are flocking thither from the country, and business has already recommenced. 7. The deplorable aspect of Sohar, I was assured, is solely attributable to Syud Toorkee’s people. Immediately an individual had the credit of possessing wealth, the same was peremptorily demanded of him. On refusal, also frequently even after compliance, the man’s house was plundered, and its master severely beaten. The money collected in this nefarious manner was squandered in gifts to the Naeem Beni Kuttub and other wild Arab tribes, whose periodical visits to Sohar were thus satisfied at the expense of the respectable inhabitants. For the future when Arab chiefs solicit money, they are to be referred to Muscat. 8. The environs presented a similar appearance to the interior of the town—many houses destroyed ; date trees wilfully felled, and others damaged by fire. 9. For three days I was engaged in ascertaining the legality of certain demands (to the amount of 2,706$) against Syud Toorkee by British subjects of the place—four Banyans and one Jew. Their claims have been admitted, and Syud Toorkee, who is still at Muscat in close confinement, has forwarded to me a draft on Zanzibar for the whole amount, wdiich I have already despatched under cover to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul and British Agent at the above port. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) W. M. PENGELLEY, British Agent at Muscat.MINUTE by the Honorable the Governor, dated the 2±th September 1861. Lieutenant Fenfrellev to lx) informed that, while we recognise the advantages resulting from a termination having been put for the present to the rebellious conduct of the Chief of Sohar without a war, which would have involved several tribes on either side in hostilities, we cannot altogether approve of the part taken by him in those preliminaries which led to the capture of Syud Toorkee. Lieutenant Pengelley has misunderstood his position as British Agent at Muscat. His mediation was proper. To become a partisan was not so. It was still less his duty to give to his zeal the prominence which was displayed by following the Sultan's warlike expedition to Sohar, at an interval of three days, in a British sloop-of-war. The course which it was becoming and open to the British Agent to pursue on this occasion was to accept the offer frankly made by the Sultan, as stated in paragraph 4, No. 29. It was obvious that the terms of such “ aman” would have comprised per sonal liberty, and that any infringement of that by the Sultan would have compelled Lieutenant Pengelley to withdraw from ail communication with the Sultan, and to report proceedings to this Government for orders. On the other hand, had Syud Toorkee failed at the intended interview to satisfv the Sultan of his perfect submission, to which effect in his written reply to the British Agent he offered to engage, Lieutenant Pengelley should then have left him to be coerced at Sohar by the Sultan's employment of troops against him. As the case stands, the Sohar Chief and his friends cannot possibly understand the restricted sense in which the British Agent in paragraph u states that he preferred to afford his protection. He will inform the Sultan that we are unable to congratulate His Highness on the means which he has employed to maintain peace; that we hoped it would have been effected in a perfectly amicable manner, with the aid of the British Agent’s friendly interposition to promote a meeting; that we are surprised that the result instead has been the capture of Syud Toorkee at the appointed place of meeting, and his imprisonment at Muscat, and that, unless with his consent, and the consent of Syud Majid, we do not approve of his removal to Zanzibar. Lieutenant Pengelley, in communicating these sentiments to the Sultan, will let it appear that any such misuse of British friendship is likely to lead to the withdrawal of the British Agency from Muscat. O wI ( 13 ) MINUTE by Mrs Excellency the Commander in Chief, dated 27th Septembw 18G1. Lieutenant Pengelley's hasty conduct in surrendering Syud Toorkee to the tender mercies of his brother, after the former had come under the safe conduct of the British Agent, will be viewed as a downright breach of faith by the Arab tribes. In future the ‘ k aman' of the British Agent will and must be considered waste paper. On such consideration, it is matter for serious reflection whether Lieutenant Pengelley can retain bis post with advantage to Her Majesty’s service. (Signed) W. MANSFIELD. 27th September 1861. MINUTE by the Honorable Mr. Frere, dated 27th September 1861. I participate in the doubts of His Excellency the Commander in Chief whether Lieutenant Pengelley can retain his post with advantage to Her Majesty’s service, after what I fear other nations more civilised and less punctilious on points of hospitality than the Arabs are, will look upon as a decided breach of faith. Lieutenant Pengelley became responsible for the safety of His Highness Syud Toorkee from Sohar to Seeb, and during such time as may be necessary in attending a conference with him. Syud Toorkee, instead of making his appearance at the appointed tune, suggested that the interview should be put off till the following* mornin fr , and ti.at not apparently from any want of faith, but because he was seriously alarmed. Lieutenant Pengelley does not appear to have waited until His Highness Syud loorkee set sail, and thus himself terminated the “ amanbut because he had proposed tbeing seriously alarmed) to defer the interview, he declares, not to Syud Toorkee, but to Syud i hooenee, that Syud Toorkee was no longer under the protection of his 1 aman, and Syud 1 oorkee is seized and made a prisoner before he h*d attempted apparently to put an end to the conference for which he had received a safe conduct. I very much dread the effect this will have upon the British character in Arabia. (Signed) W. E. FREPvE. 27th September 1861. j jI MINUTE by the Honorable the Governor, dated 1st Octolei' 1861. concurred in by the Honorable Board, 1 am as desirous as my lionoralde colleagues can lx? of remoMug Lieutenant Pengelley, but have the same difficulty in finding any one to occupy the position at Muscat just now, so important with reference to our negotiations for introducing the * line of Electric Telegraph, as I had in finding him. The fact is, in all our depart ments we have not above two or three officers competent to exchange ten words with an Arab. I contemplate our removing Lieutenant Pengelley as soon as wo can be satisfied that we have found a fit successor. His removal then will sufficiently mark our dissatisfaction with his conduct in the Sohar affair, while it will, I think, be loss likely to create confusion and disturbances than his immediate withdrawal, with no successor to endeavour by advice to avert open hostilities among the tribes, and generally to look after British interests in that quarter.

In reply, I am desired to inform you that, while Government recognise the advantages resulting from a termination having been put for the present to the rebellious conduct of the Chief of Sohar without a war, which would have involved several tribes on either side in hostilities, they cannot altogether approve of the part which you have taken in those preliminaries which led to the capture of Syud Toorkee. 3. You have, I am instructed to remark, misunderstood your position as British A o-cnt at Muscat. Your mediation was proper. To lend your influence to either of the rival parties was not so; still less was it your duty to give to your zeal the prominence which was displayed by following Uis Highness the Sultan’s warlike expedition to Sohar, at an interval of three days, in a British sloop-of-war. 4. The course which it was becoming and open to you to pursue on the occasion in question was to accept the offer frankly made by the Sultan, as stated in paragraph 4 of your letter No. 29, of the 6th July last. It was obvious that the terms of the “ am an” would have comprised personal liberty, and that any infringement o. k by the Sultan would have compelled you to withdraw from all communication with IIis Highness, and to report proceedings to this Government for orders.J ( 16 ) 5.

As the case stands, the Sohar Chief and his partisans cannot possibly understand the restricted sense in which Vide paragraph 5 of letter No. 29. you state that you preferred to afford your protection. 7. You are now requested to inform His Highness the Sultan that Government are unable to congratulate him on the means which he has employed to obtain peace; that they had hoped that it would have been effected in a perfectly amicable manner, with the aid of your friendly interposition to promote a meeting, but that they are sur prised to find that the result has been the capture of Syud Toorkee at the appointed place of meeting, followed by his imprisonment at Muscat, and that they cannot approve of his removal to Zanzibar, unless with his consent and the consent of His Highness Syud Majid. 8. In communicating these sentiments to His Highness the Sultan, the Honorable the Governor in Council desires that you will make it appear to him that any such misuse of British friendship as that now brought to notice is likely to lead to the with drawal of the British Agency from Muscat.

Dated Muscat, l%th March, 1862. I have the honour to report, for the information of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, that on the 25th ultimo I left Muscat for Bushire, accom panied by Major Henry Green, C.B., and Mr. Walton of the Telegraph Depart ment, with the view of obtaining as much information as possible from the Political Resident at Bushire regarding such places in the Persian Gulf through which it would be possible to carry a line of Telegraph, should the route through Persia not be considered feasible. 2. Leaving Bushire on the 5th instant we landed on the 7th at the Island of Surdy. This Island is said to belong to a branch of the Joasmee tribe (Arabs), and Persia has never been connected or in any way laid claim to it as far as I have been able to learn. It is a fine island, with abundance of good water, and a few Arab families live on it; altogether it is well suited for a station. 3. We next visited the island of Bomora, belonging to the Joasmee tribe of Ras-el-Khyma; it is a good island covered with grass; water is very scarce, but the nature of the soil shows that there must be abundance close to the surface. 4. Leaving Bomora we next proceeded to Sharga, an important Arab town south of Ras-el-Khyma, having a Native British Agent. This individual we took with us to visit Sultan bin Suggur, Chief of the large Joasmee tribe of Arabs: he resides at Ras-el-Khyma, and received us in the most friendly manner at that place. From Ras-el-Khyma we passed round the northern extremity of the Isthmus and landed at Dibhah : this place belongs partly to Sultan bin Suggur, and partly to the Imaum of Muscat: has abundance of water and supplies, and appears in all respects well suited for a station. 5. Proceeding now down the Batinah Coast we landed at Sohar and Burka, both of which places would make good stations. 6. The whole length of the line would be as follows:— 1. From Graine or Quarte sub-marine to Hawlool Island (or, if necessary, to Bahrein), and thence to Hawlool. 2. From Hawlool sub-marine to Surdy Island. 3. From Surdy Island sub-marine to the Island of Bomora. 4. From Bomora sub-marine to Ras-el-Khyma. 5. From Ras-el-Khyma by land across the Isthmus to Dibbah 20 (twenty) miles. 6. From Dibbah by land down the coast of Battina to Muscat.—N. B. All tins coast appears well suited for Telegraph purposes.(■ 7. In conclusion, I believe with proper arrangements that this line might be carried out. Mr. Walton’s report accompanies this letter, and I have the honour to add that this Officer will be of the very greatest service should this route be adopted. I need not say that I have been exceedingly careful not to enter into arrangements or agreement of any description with any of the Chiefs we have visited. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.

No. 20 of 1862. British Residency, Muscat, 18/'A March 1862. To Major Malcolm Green, C.B., H. M's Britisti Agent, Muscat. Sir, With reference to letter No. 266 from the Political Secretary to Government, Bombay, dated 17th January last, directing me to accompany you to the Mekran (’oast, Muscat and Persian Gulf, 1 have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the following as my opinion regarding the proposed line of telegraph between Kurrachee and the mouth of the Euphrates; together with suggestions that have occurred to me regarding it. 2. These opinions and suggestions are grounded on personal observation, Major Goldsmid’s report on the Mekran Coast, Captain Jones’ report dated 20th March 1861, Bombay Government Selections No. XXIV, 1856, and oral informa tion gained from experienced local Officers. 3. I take it for granted that the line is not to touch on Persian territory: also that the hostility of the inhabitants of the provinces which the aerial line will pass through has been greatly exaggerated; and in fact that they are, as they appear, no more barbarous and uncivilized than the same classes in India. 4. I am of opinion that wherever there is land and accessible holding ground for posts, allowing for the weight and strain of the wire, a telegraph line can be erected; and wherever such land is available it is absurd to think of resorting to a cable. The cost of construction of a land line is one-fourth that of a cable, and the risk, uncertainty, and wear and tear of the latter is about one hundred times greater than the former. I think no instance can be adduced of a submarine cable beino' resorted to where land for an aerial line was available, except in the case of the Red Sea Telegraph Company, the result of whose scheme is known to the world. 5. 1 he proposed line under report can be divided for convenience of reference into four sections :— l*’^ from Kurrachee to Gwadur or Charbar, or “ the Mekran Coast Line.’’ 2nd from Mekran (oast to Muscat, or “ Deep-sea Sub-marine Line.” from Muscat to Ras-ool-Khyma, or u the Battinah Coast Line.” from Ras-ool-Khyma to Grane or “ Persian Gulf Sub-marine Line.” * Accompanying Major Goldsmid’s report. ■ -3 * Accompanying Major Goldsmid’s report. i I.—The Mekran Coast Line. 6. From Major Goldsmid’s report we learn that no serious difficulties present themselves from Kurrachee to the Hingole river (marked A on Chart) a distance of 130 miles hy the marching route, and he particularly draws our attention to the twelve miles of country immediately to the westward of the mouth of the Hingole, marked off A to B in Chart.* You therefore ordered the “ Hugh Lindsay” to land us here in order to examine the coast from the Hingole River to the face of the Malan. We ascended the loftiest of the hills called “ Deil Joosh” about three miles to the westward of the Ilingole. These hills, composed of sheet rock or u tullah,” being of volcanic origin are very rough, and are cast up without reference to order or ranges, but they are accessible and present good holding ground ; and although the construction of the line along this range of hills will be tedious, I anticipate no serious obstacles whatever, especially if the assistance and co-opera tion of the Beloochees are secured. From the top of the Deil Joosh we traced a valley running from Has Kutcherie to the Gibbull Upp range, and from a second observation made at B immediately under the Malan, you expressed an opinion that there was another valley at the back of the second range and to the sea-face of the range, at the back of which Major Goldsmid’s party went. If, however, we adopt the line along the coast, which 1 recommend as the best course for several reasons, the matter of these valleys inland will be of no consequence, although it will be a matter of great importance should a route at the real' of the Malan be adopted. 7. Regarding the Malan itself, at first sight the difficulties appear insuper able. From the eastern sea corner the rock appeared to be about 800 feet high perpendicularly. In the last paragraph I have expressed my conviction that we can overcome the difficulties between A &amp; B, or from the Ilingole to the foot of the Malan, and I have no hesitation in stating that a line can be suspended from the top of the Malan, to meet the line at its foot. To accomplish this, the wire must be well insulated: seven strand gutta-percha covered copper wire would be the best. This should be laid in the centre of a coir rope, in order to relieve the wire from all strain, and to prevent abrasion and chafing; this being made fast on the top of the Malan, it could be let down and joined to the main line below. 8. From the 10th paragraph of Major Goldsmid’s letter No. 8, dated Ormarrah 14th January, and his Memorandum dated 7th February, paragraph 3. I imagine that from the top of the Malan to Ormarrah no difficulties present them selves. 9. I conclude that it is intended to establish a station at Ormarrah. I would suggest a small station of observation should also be established at Sonmeanee, with a view to the more rapid restoration in the event of interruption to communication. From personal inspection 1 consider Ormarrah in every way suited for a Telegraph station, more particularly as the harbour can be entered at all times of the year when the open coast cannot be approached. 10. From Ormarrah we proceeded to the mouth of the Roomra River (marked C in Chart), and examined the coast towards Pussnee (marked D in Chart). This is certainly the most difficult piece of country I have ever seen. It is impossible to carry the line along the beach between the foot of the hills and the sea, and the hills themselves afford no holding ground whatever. They are not only extremely intricate and irregular, but are composed of light clay baked in the sun, and are full of holes and hollow ravines. To climb them is exceedingly difficult, as the nobs of earth to which you look for footing and holding snap off*, and can be compared only to brittle pie-crust. The objections to taking the line along the beach are—1st, its extreme narrowness, the sea reaching the foot of the hills at high tides; 2nd, no holding ground for posts, which would also be liable to be washed away by the fresh water rushing down the ravines in the rains; and 3rd, the proximity to the sea would interfere with the insulation, and rapidly corrode even zinc coated wire. 11. We know that this description of hills extends ten miles inland, and verv probably 50 miles; we have no alternative, therefore, but to overcome the difficulties presented in the fifteen miles of coast under notice.12. Having no statistics from which to judge of the average fall of rain at this part of the coast, I conclude from the mountainous nature of the country, and from the marks in the ravines, that at times the rain comes down in torrents. It is at any rate best to he prepared for so probable an occurrence. 1, therefore, recom mend that the line he carried through these hills within a quarter of a mile of the sea. The valleys between the ridges are of very trifling breadth, and by erecting the posts as near as possible together, and as nearly in a direct line as the nature of the country will permit, the strain on e 1 ' M1 be greatly reduced. In order to give the posts a hold m this very brittle clay, I would secure them three feet in the ground on the top of the hillocks, by fixing each into a wooden frame made of two railway sleepers divided up the centre, and by using wire stays from the top of the post to the extremities of the frame. The extra expense attending this plan would not exceed 10 Rupees for each post, or Rs. 3,000 for the whole distance. The posts should also be as short as possible, in order to get rid of top weight. The iron standards without the wooden top piece would do well for this purpose. 13. I am decidedly of opinion that there must be a station at or near Puss- nee, the distance between Ormarrah and Gwadur (180 miles) over bad country, near the sea, being much too great for successful direct working in bad weather. 14. From Pussnee to Gwadur is rough country, but Major Goldsmid reports no particular difficulties, and to avoid the coast marked E to F in Chart we have merely to go inland a few miles. 15. Gwadur itself I consider a very eligible place for an office. A house on the table land at the top of the hill between the sea and the town would serve as a sanitarium, so that employes at the unhealthy stations could recruit their health while performing duty here. 16. Between Gwadur and Charbar, a distance of about 100 miles, I can only judge of the country from coasting along en route to the latter place. The coun try appears rough, but not so bad as some parts already alluded to, and I anticipate no greater difficulties here than on any other part of the coast. Charbar itself appears to be a particularly suitable place for a station, being cheerful, healthy, and clean. 17. I particularly request that it may be understood that in this report on the Mekran Coast I have advanced no theories whatever, and have suggested no thing but what I am myself willing and able to accomplish with practical Assistants. There is no doubt but that there arc many and great difficulties to be encountered, much greater, and many more even than have been met with in the construction of the Indian lines ; and I have no wish to under-rate these difficulties ; at the same time experience has taught us that more serious obstacles can be overcome, and there are none on the Mekran Coast that skill and perseverance cannot surmount. It would be out of the question to attempt to construct this line with men accustomed only to European lines and a European climate. In the Indian Telegraph Department there are many Inspectors and others especially adapted for this duty, having been employed through the mutinies, when they had to exercise their judgment, and others who have been engaged in constructing lines in the Hills, Amman Coast, &amp;c. The Home Government have already sent five Inspectors to the Indian Telegraph Department, with a view that five experienced men should be transferred to the Mekran line. II.—The Deep-sea Sub-marine Line. 18. Should political reasons prevent our proceeding farther than Charbar by the Mekran Coast, we are necessitated to resort to a sub-marine cable to reach the nearest land on which to carry on the aerial line. By the Charts the nearest point on the Arabian Coast to Charbar is Muscat, distant 175 miles. We have as yet seen no soundings between these two places, but the depth is known to be considerable. The length of the cable is, however, so favor able that it will greatly obviate any objections likely to be raised on account of the depth along this route. For this line 1 would propose a very light cable, with strong shore ends, the cost of which when laid down would not exceed £20,000.5 The following quotation on ocean telegraphy from Shaffner’s Manual, page 65G, is worthy of repetition here :— u The real question for future projectors of lines of sub-marine telegraph is not how deep, or how boisterous, or how wide the sea is, but what are the electric limits to the length of sub-marine cables.” 19. It is necessary to add that should any causes that I am at present unaware of prevent the aerial line from extending beyond Gwadur to Charbar, the length of the deep-sea line to Muscat will be increased by sixty miles. III.— The Battinah Coast Live. 20. From Muscat to the shores of the Persian Gulf has been so carefully examined by us within the last few days that no doubt remains that, independent of political or other reasons, the route via Dibbah to Bas-el-Khyma, a distance of 210 miles, is the best for telegraphic purposes. 21. From Muscat, 8 miles to tlie northward, we have precipitous hard rocks, but a valley runs through them to Muttra, and on to the open coast beyond. From Seeb along the coast through Burk ha, Suaick, Sokar and Shenas, to Kore Kulba the coast is perfectly level, and is thickly cultivated the whole distance with date palms, &amp;c. Such an extent of level cultivated coast is not to be found in India. I rom Kore Kulba to Fedgeerah the hills begin to approach the sea, but no obstacles whatever present themselves, as there is a considerable space of level land between the foot of the hills and the sea. Between Fedgeerah and Kore Fakawn there is a hill about a mile in length which abuts on the sea, but if we cannot work round it we can go over it, as the sides are neither precipitous nor rough ; otherwise this piece of coast is flat, and for the greater part planted with date trees. Between Kore Fakawn and Dibbah the hills appear rocky, and in three places they abut on the sea, with a precipitous sea-front, but they offer no obstacle worthy of more than a pass ing notice. ' 1 22. Along this coast stores and material can be landed at any time and at any spot they are required; thus much simplifying the work of construction, and avoiding the usual heavy expense of land carnage. 23. From information obtained orally from Sultan Bin Suggur at Bas-el- Khyma and from his Sheikh at Dibbah, we learned that the distance between these two places is about 20 miles; that there is a good pass for camels, &amp;c.; and that half tne distance is perfectly flat, the other half being stony and through the mountain passes. 24. This line, therefore, from Muscat to Bas-el-Khyma requires no further report, and it could be constructed very rapidly once the material was distributed along the coast. IV. —The Persian Gulf Sub-marine Line. 25. The desiderata for this cable are—1st, short lengths; 2ndlv, good level bottom, sand or mud ; 3rdly, non-liability to injury from ships’ anchors and coral patches. 26- By short lengths the risk that must attend the laying of all sub-marine cables is diminished, and after they are laid they are more easily worked, and in case of total failure the loss is proportionately small. In the 25th paragraph of Captain Jones’ report above noticed he suggests that a single cable should be laid from Khore Abdullah to the Great Tomb or Surdey Island. The centre of the Gulf certainly offers a fine level bottom, the depth not exceeding fifty fathoms, and clear of all anchorages, butthe distance is much too great, exceeding 400 miles. 27. Wliere we can find suitable spots to enable us to make short stretches they should, I think, he taken advantage of. I would propose the following route for the Sub-marine Gulf Line From Bas-el-Khyma to Bomosa Island, which we found to be a fine luxuriant little island, with good water and safe anchorage, dis tance 48 miles, free of rocks—From Bomosa to Surdey, another fine island with abundance of water and a good soil for cultivation, distance 2G miles, extreme depth by chart 42 fathoms; also free of rocks.—From Surdey to Hawlool Island, which wek/L M . . *• n 6 did not visit, but have every reason to suppose is a similar Island to the many we saw, is 120 miles. From this island I would propose to stretch to Has Reccan, or Bahrein, thence toZuzarine, to Garrow, and ultimately to Grane. But if it should be found possible to carry an aerial line along the western shore of the Gulf from El-Katif to Grane, the difficulties and uncertainties attending cabling would be at once overcome, except between Ras-el-Khyma and Ll-Katif. 28. On such Islands as Zuzarine and Garrow perhaps it would not be possible to keep up an establishment, but the cable might be laid so as to touch on them, in order to be able to test in case of accident or failure in the communica tion. The greater part of the Gulf appears to have a level bottom; in case, there fore, of the cable failing at any time, it could be easily over-run,—a process perfectly impossible to perform when it is laid over an uneven bottom, or in great depths. 29. Perhaps difficulties may arise in keeping clear of anchorages, owing to the pearl-fishers anchoring promiscuously between llawlool and the main land oi Bahrein. I am not competent to ' neak with any certainty, not having visited that part of the Gulf; but I would ’ a t.t strongly recommend that enquiries be insti tuted regarding the coast between El-Khatif and Grane, and the feasibility of the cable touching at so important a place as Bahrein. 30. As directed in paragraph 3 of Political Department letter referred to in my first paragraph, I await your instructions as to my future proceedings. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. IZAAK WALTON, Supt. Govt. Telegraph Department. (On special duty.) I•*- • / No. 92 of 1862. From Major Malcolm Green, C.B. Political Agent at Muscat. To The Secretary to Government, I have tlie honour to acknowledge the receipt* of your letter No. 2233 dated 14th July 1862 with accompaniment, and * On 6th October. to re p 0r t as follows for the information of Ilis Excellency the Governor in Council. 2. The bond fide possessions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat are of small extent on the Mekran and Persian coasts, and to those only I understand the instructions in your letter refer. 3. From information collected from every source available at Muscat it would appear that from Gwadur to Pishkhan on the West, distant 25 miles, and from Gwadur to Shahidkoh on the East, also distant about 25 miles, total oO miles, comprises the coast line of the Sultan’s Gwadur territory. From Cape Pishkhan travelling westwards the road, passing through Khelat Territory and a tiact tributary to Persia, again enters the Muscat possessions at I atkooe oi Etej and continues in it to the town of Chahbar, a distance of 20 miles. 4. The total length of coast therefore which belongs to Muscat is 70 miles, viz. 50 in the Gwadur district, and 20 from Patkooe to Chahbar ; a rough tracing is attached showing how the country as far as Bunder Abbas is divided. 5. I have calculated that about 40 Bupees per annum per mile would cover the whole expense of guarding this line of 70 miles, total 2,800 Bupees per annum : my estimate is based on the price of labour, provisions &amp;c. in this country; and previous to receiving Major Goldsmid’s report I had considered that 2000 Bupees should be the sum allowed for the Gwadur territory. 6. I have not received information as to the intention of Government regard ing the extension of the line from Chahbar, whether it is proposed to carry it across the Sea to Muscat and so along the Batinah Coast to Bas-el-khyma or from Chahbar through Persian Territory to Bunder Abbas. 7. The country from Sudeech to Bunder Abbas, a distance of about 200 miles, is only farmed by the Sultan of Muscat from the Persian Government; I have therefore carefully abstained from touching upon any question regarding this tract until further instructions are received from Government. 8. I have to report that the line of telegraph from Muscat along the coast of Batinah would possess the advantage of passing through a country the inhabitants of which are in no way affected by foreign politics; its limits are clearly defined, and it passes for the greater part through the territory of one Government only, the remainder belonging to friendly Arab Chiefs. 1 his line is referred to in my letter to Government No. 5 of 1862 dated 18th March 1862 with accompaniments by Mr. Walton of the Telegraph Department. 9. I beg respectfully to draw the attention of Government to paragraph 100 pao-e 27 of Major Goldsmid’s report, and would suggest that if any doubts exist on^the Mekran Coast as to the actual boundaries of the Khelat and Muscat territories, they should be definitely settled by competent authority without delay int V# 2 conjunction with representatives on the part ot the Khan of Khelat and th(‘ Sultan of Muscat. 10 I enclose a copy of the terms of a convention which I should propose to place before His Highness the Sultan; it is forwarded for any alterations Government may wish to make, and on its return it can be presented to the Sultan for his agreement or otherwise and signature, and then left tor the final decision of the British Government. 11. I have explained the tenor of the convention in general terms to 11 is Highness, and he gives full assurances of furthering the views of Government by every means in his power. . t 0 I have the honour, to be, &amp;c., Hated Muscat, | ^Signed) MALCOLM GREEN, Major, 16&lt;/t October 1862. j Political Agent at Muscat.

That the Sultan of Muscat shall make his own arrangements for the protection of the line of Telegraph through his dominions; but should it appear at any time that those arrangements are deficient for the purpose specified, the 1 olitical Agent at Muscat shall be empowered to call upon the Sultan to make such additional arrangements as may appear necessary, provided that the total yearly cost of such shall not exceed the amount of the full yearly subsidy. 7 That any disagreements between the Telegraph Officials and the subjects of the Sultan shall be referred'to the Political Officer at Muscat, if they cannot be satisfactorily settled on the spot. 8. Continued obstruction or injury to the line may cause revocation of this agreement at any time on the part of the British Government. 9 That for the protection of the line for 50 miles in the Gwadur territory, the British Government shall pay the Sultan of Muscat a yearly subsidy of 2,000 Rupees, and for the twenty miles in the Chabhar territory a yearly sum of 800 Rupees. 10 That the payment for the protection of the line through each territory shall com mence from the date that the Telegraph Officers commence work in such territory. 11 The agreement made between the parties hereto, as above defined, is to be con sidered dependent for completion and effect upon the approval of the British Government. Muscat, } \lth October 1862. S (Signed) MALCOLM GREEN, Major, Political Agent, Muscat.* No. 95 OF 1862. From Major M. Green, C.B. Political Agent at Muscat. To The Secretary to Government, Political Defartment. BOMBAY. Sir, In reporting my departure from Muscat for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council, I have the honour to offer a few observations relative to the affairs of that country during my residence in it of about nine months. 2. At the time of my arrival the affairs of the country were, as Government is informed, in an exceedingly unsettled and unsatisfactory state; a large portion of the most fertile portion of it was in the hands of various tribes in rebellion against their Government, and after my arrival the Sultan as well as the principal people about him appeared for some time to be in doubt as to whether he had the power and means of regaining possession of his dominions; there was not wanting treachery amongst his nearest relatives to add to the embarrassments of the Sultan. 3. I soon noticed that an opinion very generally prevailed that, in preference to allowing any other nation to settle the quarrel between the Imaum and his subjects, the British Government would, were matters allowed to get to their worst, interfere and openly assist His Highness. 4. As I saw that holding this opinion, there was an evident want of energy on the part of the Muscat Government almost amounting to indifference, and knowing that the Sultan possessed both power and means if he chose to apply them, I took every opportunity of discountenancing the expectation of assistance, and continually pointed out to His Highness how derogatory it would be for him as an independent prince to receive assistance from any foreign Government whatever against his own people, and that by doing so he would only still further loosen his power and hold over them. I never attempted to force my opinions u pon His Highness, they were never given unless asked for, but finally affairs became so bad that on the rebels attaking the town and fort of Sohar I felt compelled and justified in informing His Highness that unless energetic measures were taken, I should send H. M. Ship Tigris to bring off the British subjects at that place. 5. My various letters to Government will have informed them of the effect of this measure ; the ships of war of His Highness were at once equipped and he himself having collected several of his tribes proceeded to the disturbed districts, and in a very short time recovered possession of the whole of them, and received the submission of the rebels and their Chiefs. 6. I have information from travellers who have passed through the lately disturbed districts, that for many years they have not been in such a peaceful and satisfactory state, and the Sultan has continually written thanking me for the advice I had given him, and for my having stayed in Muscat at his request during his absence, instead of proceeding to Gwadur as I had intended for Telegraph purposes. 7. The anxiety of His Highness regarding the safety of Muscat during his absence was owing principally to fear of disturbances on the part of his brother Syud Toorkee, thecircumstances relating to whose imprisonment and release Government are fully acquainted with. But Syud Toorkee during the whole time I have been residing at Muscat has given no signs whatever in word or deed of disloyal conduct towards the Imaum, and has generally paid me a long visit once a week since his release. 8. From information I had received previous to my arrival, I had reason to believe that complications would arise from time to time regarding the nationality of a number of people in Muscat and its dependencies, but it^has turned out otherwise; the few trifling differences that have arisen since I have been here, have been easily treated with, nor have the local authorities on any single occasion whatever thrown any obstacle in the way of settlement, and letter No. 2048 of 1862 (Circular) dated 20th June 1862 received from Government, clearly points out the limits of nationality of a great portion of the population of the place. 9. The late Steam postal arrangement has given universal satisfaction throughout the country, and His Highness the Imam has presented a space of ground for a coal establishment to the Steam Packet Company, free of rent for the time during which their Steamers may run to Muscat. 10. I should be remiss did I not report to Government the great benefit which all classes in this place have derived from the presence of Mr. Rozario the experienced Medical Officer attached to this Agency; his skill and kindness and attention to the immense number of patients who have been under his treatment, combined with his knowledge of the language, has gained him the entire confidence of the country people. 11. I cannot too strongly express the great good feeling that has existed during my stay here between His Highness the Sultan and myself, and he takes every opportunity of showing how deeply he values the friendship of the British Government. His Highness has continually informed me how much he is gratified at having an English Officer at his Court through whom he can communicate directly to Government. 12. In conclnsion I have to report that on account of the number of British subjects here, both resident and otherwise, as well as for political reasons, it is advisable that the place should not be left for any length of time without the presence of an experienced British Officer. I have the honour to be &amp;c..

But the province of Oman may fairly aspire, not only to the Patriarchal period, but to an earlier still, to that of the sons of Noah ; for we read in Genesis, that Ishmael had twelve sons, who were the Princes that ruled as far as Sur. And here we have a living memorial of a direct line from the Antediluvian Patriarch, in a tribe on the Southern Coast, called the Adramoth. This tribe possess a peculiar physical configu ration, much like that of the Kocany of India. Even their accent resembles the latter so far that their nationality becomes doubtful till ascertained. If this likeness be considered, the presumption will be that during the infancy of the world the tide of population to India flowed through these regions ; and that the two races may claim Adramoth as their common progenitor. Again, the present Yarubi tribe claim Yare or Jare, the grandson of Shem, as their progenitor. History or tradition, however, throws but little light beyond a period of Mahommedan conquest, when the conquering Kuleefas sent their hordes of invaders to conquer the inhabitants and to settle amongst them. The Government compilation of Persian Gulf Selections gives an account as far back as 400 n. c., when a certain tribe with their leader named Mulluk came from JSedge and formed a government, who was subsequently joined by a tribe from Yemen, called the Henavi. Geographical remarks .—Although maps convey a pretty clear general idea, the special geography is involved in obscurity, therefore if from information gleaned, I bestow a few lines it will not be misplaced here. Taking then Sahara, the great central desert/ as a starting point, we will find extending from its border all round, as far as Yemen on one side, and Bussora on the other, a series of low fertile plains, table-land and ranges of barren mountains ; for example as in Oman, if proceeding inland across from seaboard, the path Avill lie to the extent of about twenty miles—amidst rocky valleys and barren mountains ; subsequently if toward Bostak northward, on a gradually rising plain till the Jubbul Akdar ; and if toward Seymeyl, southward, on low plains till the border of the desert. The distance from the sea-board to the desert has been computed at seventy miles. The Jubbul Akdar, as its name implies, is ever green, and luxuriates in varieties of fruit, also it is said to enjoy a fair supply of frost and snow in winter, and a remarkably temperate summer. The low plains and table-land are watered by running streams, springs, canals under ground, and wells, that would bid fair for cultivation if ruled by a more fostering government, that would encourage the present tillers of land, and induce the wandering tribes to settle down into a more peaceful pursuit, which cannot fail to be a perennial source of wealth. For the cotton of Oman may fairly compete with that of America. It possesses fibre equally long, strong and as beautifully delicate and soft. If compared with the Egyptian produce, I doubt not, it will be found closely allied to it, if not of the same quality. As it is now, it has been for years, the political disturbances, the Wahabee aggressions, the weak rule of the Sultan, and the rapacity of the local officials keep up a constant intestinal feud and distrust, whereby the well-disposed are paralysed, and the marauding tribes gain strength in their predatory pursuits.X V Vi I 2 Geological remarks —The mountains run in parallel ranges in a direction from North to South, and present imposing scenes from their precipitous tops that beetle high into fine crests, sharp ridges, and points. On examination they present a dark columnar form, whose fragments can be easily torn by hand, and which may be termed basalt formation. Sweeping in some places along the flanks to the base, are oblique strata, that terminate below into per pendicular ones. Others there are simply of oblique strata, as if elevated by repeated disturbances at different periods, and also of confused masses, as if suddenly launched forth wherein neither strata nor column can be distin- o-uished. The columnar abound with peroxide of iron, without any trace of lime, but mica seems to pervade in a marked degree, and it can be detected shining by moonlight. Sand stones are dug out of the oblique strata, and in many places, veins of quartz are seen interlaid between the perpendicular ones. Muscat .—Is divisible into a walled town and suburbs. The former is situated on the anterior third of a valley, formed by stretching across of an arm from one range of hills to another, and presents a picturesque appearance, encased as it were in bases of arid hills, that tower high into imposing heights. The latter, the suburbs, occupy the remaining two-thirds, and is divided into two sections, called the Tooyan and Meeabeen, by a hillock thrown between. The Tooyan bears west and consists of a river-bed, in the centre a flat piece of rich dark soil-land, called the Zabadia,—the fat land—some wells containing very excellent water, one of which is protected by an armed tower, called the Kavia, and possesses a mortar-made canal leading to the town. In the vicinity of these wells, fresh fodder, vegetables, and jassamine are cultivated with advan tage. The remaining portion is occupied by lower class of Arabs and Beloochees, who live in mat and date-stick-built houses, huddled together, leaving but a narrow^ space in the shape of streets. And far out on the hill range, is one of the much-spoken-of mountain passes opening westwards over a village called Baham. It is guarded by a folding gate and a body of armed Bedouins. The Meeabeen bears east, owing to it being rocky is devoid of cultivation, save a spot or two. It is utilized for burial purposes, as well for the residence of the lower classes of Arabs and Beloochees, similar to those in Tooyan. Here also is another of the mountain passes opening southwards, over a village called Cidah, and guarded as the one in Tooyan. Town .—Of Muscat consists of spacious houses crowded together in viola tion of all known sanitary laws, and those governing the dimensions of roads and streets, with two outlets, called the Bab Kabeer and Bab fc'ageer—the greater and lesser gate. The former opens into Tooyan and the latter into Meeabeen, both being guarded by armed I^edouins. The most conspicuous, and one worthy of notice is the building called Graiza, a term taken from the Portuguese Iu;reja—the Church. This although much mowed down by time, retains sufficient of its former grandeur as to evince some pretentions to archi tectural skill, and fine taste of 'the builder. It is said to have been the Palace of the Portuguese Governor, but it is evident that it formed also accommoda tion for the garrison soldiers, to the extent of three companies. In front, it is said troops mustered and drilled, and that a band of musicians played every evening to relieve the monotony; for these purposes appaiently a good sized square has been marked out, which is now used as an arsenal. r l he central market appears to have been the original ground-work of the town, and to have been well laid out; but now encroached upon out of all proportion; and, as houses usurped the place of shops, the latter betook themselves to Bab Sageer, which is now the principal seat of the market place. Custom Houses .—On one of the gates, is marked in European cha racters 1624 a. r&gt;., which testifies to it having been built in the seventeenth century. The Wharf, the Office and the Warehouses, though small, and now much out of repair, may fairly vie with many ports of India in construction and completeness. All wholesale transaction is here effected under the supervision3 of the farmer of the Custom revenue, who is supposed to see that there may be no monopoly. Imports .—Rice from Calcutta by ships, from April to June.. Cotton goods from Bombay by bi-monthly Mail Steamer. Sugar from Mauritius, a vessel or two, in August, or March. Cocoanut, rafters, and cloves from Zanzibar in May. Corn from Persian Gulf by country craft, as also silk, wool, opium and nuts, such as almonds, &amp;c., from Bushire and Bunder Abbas, from September to March. Native crafts take from Bombay, rice, sugar, oil, condiments, and different articles of luxury during the fair season. American vessels bring supplies of ammunition, fire-arms, and some articles of household furniture and ornaments. Yemen crafts bring coffee and a kind of coarse sugar. Exports .—Dates from August to January. Salt brought from Khism and Hormuz to Calcutta usually as ballast. Mauritius vessels take salt-fish, corn, and dates in return ; and American dates only of the variety called furd. Yemen crafts take dates of three or four varieties, halwas and fruit to some extent to Calcutta, Bombay, and Persian Gulf. Shark fins for China; fish- maws, cotton and mother of pearl shell to small extent, for European markets via Bombay. Revenue .—Muscat yields a Custom revenue of 100,000 German Crowns, on which the present Government has to depend. But under the late Sultan, Syed Toweynee, Bunder Abbas contributed 35,000, Gwadur 5,000, Chabar 2,000, and Zanzibar 40,000, which made up an aggregate sum of 184,000 German Crowns, a sum by no means adequate for the requirement. Consequently since the separation of Zanzibar the Muscat treasury has been bordering on insolvency, so as to augur an uncertain future. Houses .—Are built in a manner to adapt them to the severity of summer and autumnal heats, and to seclude women from the public gaze. Both of these ends have been amply attained, in the castle-like form employed, borrowed no doubt from Graiza. Each has a courtyard in the centre, and partitions raised one upon another for two stories, all round, and terminate above into an open terrace. Materials employed are sandstone and mud, the latter mixed with fragments of old mortar, gravel and other rubbish, makes up a pretty durable fabric ; but those built with sandstone and mortar are the strongest. The interior is plastered with Gutch, a material that forms an exceedingly smooth surface, that improves by time, so as to require no washing over. Parts, subject to action of water, are plastered with Sarooj, a material absolutely proof against water. Both ot these are worthy of attention in connection with public build ings in Bombay. The Gutch 1 believe to be crude plaster of Paris, it being similar in its properties may be utilised for ornamental devices, as in Muscat. The Sarooj is a combination of Peroxide of Iron with lime and other matter. Had it not been for the apathy of owners there would have been fewer of the delapidated houses than those now seen throughout crumbling into dust, and at this stage only the owners awake to the necessity of doing something. The nar rowness of the street has been taken advantage of by Bunnyas to cover them with mats and bamboos, to exclude the hot weather sun. Cesspools for refuse render every house unpleasant, and unhealthy, and often diffuse the adjacent streets with offensive smells. Muscat Harbour.—Or Cove, as it is called, possesses a good anchorage, and lots of water for vessels of any draught, but it being exposed to the North- Westerly winds, that bring in heavy rolling seas, makes the situation of vessels precarious during the winter and spring. The entrance is guarded by Ports, called the Gulali, the Capitanie, and two Seeras. They were huilt by the Portuguese and are so placed as to direct a cross fire, which makes Muscat invulnerable in front, as the mountain passes do behind. Inhabitants .—From the continual concourse of foreigners, Muscat may be deemed the very Alexandria of the Persian Gulf. The permanent residents 44 need only meet notice here: the Arabs, the Beloochees, the Bunyahs, the Khojas and a sprinkling of a few Persians. Arabs .—Esteem themselves with patrician consideration, wherein lies the cause of many of their shortcomings. They live isolated, without ever holding any social meetings, except an hour’s Court at the door t where some may stop to take a cup of cawa and move on. Physically they are well made. The women owing to their seclusion, are delicate and weak with regular features, and as they partake of the same patrician ideas, they, as a rule, do not make docile or agreeable wives; therefore Arabs would sooner take an Abyssinian or an African concubine than an Arab wife. So marriages are rare, procreation on the decline, a slow, but certain decay is going on ; and strange as it may seem, the proportion of males to females is 1 to 20, and, stranger still, the rate of males to female births bears almost the same proportion. Belooches —Both sexes are strong and given to physical labour; morally and socially they are well conditioned, as can be expected from their ignorant state. They seem happy. They marry early as circumstances will permit them, and are exceedingly prolific. Concubinage is rare amongst them. Bunyahs .—There are two classes, the Bhattias and the Lavanas; the latter from Scinde, called Mooltanee, and the former from Cutch, called Cutchee. They display the same genius for commerce as they do in other places, and it may be added, that they are the mainstay of the Muscat Government. Kojahs.— A. sect of Indian Mussulmen, settled at Muttrah near Muscat. They have been admitted as British Indian subjects up to the year 1859, when they were, under some peculiar interpretation of some legal technicalities, made over to the Government of Muscat, since then their lot has been hard, and they are visibly declining in material prosperity, although they, with the Bunyahs, form the chief trading community, without whom the Sultanet cannot exist, even for a day. The transfer has rather injured than benefited the !State from its tendency to limit the scope of enterprising men from fear of an absolute Government. Morally and socially they are well conditioned. They marry early, and are prolific, but casualties appear to be in proportion, that they do not seem to increase numerically beyond 500 male adults, owing partly 1 believe to early marriages and the overcrowded state of their locality. Population .—Of Muscat has been estimated at 7,000 male adults in town and suburbs, of which about 200 are the Bunyahs. Muttrah .—A town next to Muscat, requires no special notice, it being in general acceptation the same as Muscat. Bedouins .—Of Oman are not so large and strongly made as their brethren of Nedge and Yemen, but are equally active, and excel in the art of using the sword, something after the old Highland fashion as depicted by Sir VValter Scott in the person of Boderic Dim. Intellectually they are in a state of semi-barbarism. They muster in sundry tribes, sprung from the parent stocks Gaffer and Hena, from whom they derive the general designation, the Gaffree and the Heenavi; the latter is the dominant race, and from it proceeds the present ruling dynasty of Imaum. Each tribe bears feudal attachment to its Chief, through whom it K ars allegiance to the Sultan. The latter is through mercenary motives rather than any feudal attachment; a fact amply illustrated by events of the last five years, and at this epoch, exhibits the necessity of the maintenance of a regularly armed force. A body of 500 men armed with rifles wi'l be adequate and can be maintained at 2,000 German Crowns a month, with advantage to the State. It will thereby supplant the existing present giving system, to which there can never be any limit, and which has often placed the Government at the mercy of designing men and mercenary Chiefs. I he semi-barbarism of the Bedouins do not permit them to live in concord. Each tribe with its herds of cattle move far from the other, and from time to time change localities, partly from a desire of isolation and partly in 1 V. ✓ *search of pasture, and should it ever happen that one cross the other, instiantly some old blood feud is recalled that terminates usually in bloodshed. Religion .—They have none, nominally conforming themselves to Moham medanism. but morality is held in high esteem and considerable respect, and attention is bestowed on their women, who are generally well behaved, and attached to their husbands, but will not tolerate the presence of a rival—so that polygamy and concubinage is rare amongst them. A strange peculiarity of the Bedouins ought not to pass unnoticed here. If a sleeping Bedouin be suddenly awakened he will involuntarily draw his weapon and cut down the intruder. Should, however, one happen to get too near a loud commanding shout will bring the sleeper to his senses, and ward off the mischief. From this peculiarity it would seem that they apprehend evil continually. The following is a numerical table of tribes under their respective divisions :— Aggregate total of both sections 89,700 adult males, who acknowledge the Sultan as their ruler, and who can be called upon for active service if means permitted. The late Sultan Syed Saeed computed once the number of men capable of bearing arms at 75,000.G ]k v Court of Muscat .—The Sultan holds four Courts a day at 10 a m. and 4 p. m., to attend the current work of the State, and at 6 a. m. and 9 p. m , to receive visits of courtesy. Europeans are received in the drawing-room at times specia ly arranged. Education .—In Muscat and Oman, is in a limited degree. To read ihe Koran mechanically is all that is sought and taught in private and public school-rooms; and on some favoured few, the art of writing an ordinary letter is bestowed. So Muscat and Oman can produce but few men of letters. There is one in Muscat, however, the fam ms Mohamed Razeek, a Poet and an Historian, and who being a centenarian, and possessing all his faculties unim paired, can relate the remotest incidents with accuracy, and produce a poetical piece on auspicious occasions. Administration of Justice .—Is by two sources, the Shurra Shureef, or the laws of the Koran, and the Salifa. The former administered by a Cadi daily in a patriarchal style at the gate of Graiza; the latter by a committee of mer chants, who are guided by mercantile usage. Capital crimes are rare, and their cases are tried and adjudicated by the Sultan in person. Amusement —Cawa Khana is the only means of amusement to the higher order of Arabs. After passing the day in idleness they repair in the evening to regale themselves with Coffee and the Hooka, and to hear the news of the day. The lower orders, however, indulge in instrumental music, singing and dancing, performed by eunuchs and Seedees. Of the latter, both sexes perform with grace and precision, and on festivals they congregate at the furthest extre mity of Tooyan, and enjoy themselves with spirit. Here a strange display of mesmeric power is made: a circle is traced on the ground, and Seedees of both sexes dance around to the music of a drum, and gradually bv degrees first one and then another becomes infused as it were by a peculiar spirit of violence, and attracted towards the drum, before which they suddenly fall on their knees, and exhibit a most frantic figure, throwing their heads backward and forward, and contorting their bodies with such violence and into such forms that none but mad men could. At last exhausted and seemingly insensible they fall, when an old woman appears, makes passes with her hands across the face, and restores them to consciousness, to enable them to return to the circle to be similarly affected again and again. This is called the Devil’s dance. Arts .—Navigation is taught from father to son, and from Nacoda to Nacoda. Of these, however, the number is fast dwindling off, that but few there are now who can be claimed by Muscat as her own, but the seamen she produces are very superior. Weavers, carpenters, shoe or sandal-makers, are creditable. Pugrees, and Loongees weaved, are peculiar and neat, and much prized by Arabs of Oman and Zanzibar. If they can be imitated it would open a remu nerative field to European traders. Smiths are ordinary, but the art of shoeing horses is not known. Masons are good and excel in ornamental work, embroi dery of Abbas and dagger-hilt engraving, wrought in gold and silver, are rich and unique. Women are capable of coarse knitting and sewing, but owing to irregular application and inventive genius ihe art is stationary. Halwa .—Of Muscat is celebrated for its quality, and highly prized in Bom bay and Calcutta. Slavery .—In Muscat is nominal. Although slaves are bought and sold, their condition is equal to that of freemen in point of ease and comfort, but the misery and hardship endured during transit from port to port is considerable. I hey are brought usually from Zanzibar in country crafts about the end of April and beginning of May, and landed at a place called Kore Grama, near Sur; and from thence hurried overland to the interior of Oman, Batinah, Arab pirate coast, and Muscat. They are not taken to Kore Fakam, Kussab and Kas-al Khyma, as in former times. Provisions. —Of all kinds and at all times are procurable, though at an exor-W / bitant rate. Fraits in abundance, amongst which, the Dergamot Citron stands the most conspicuous. F;od .—Higher classes subsist on rice, fish, vegetables prepared with a fair quantity of ghee and condiments. Meat on rare occasions, as a luxury. They also use wheaten cakes, prepared at home, but those in the bazaar are as good. The lower orders live on fish and dates, and occasionally treat themselves to a cake and a kabob from the bazaar. But locusts, boiled, salted and dried are eagerly sought for by all, as possessing a peculiar invigorating virtue. Probably the phosphorus they contain impart the peculiar virtue. Date-stones, boiled with dried fish, are given to cattle, and is said to produce rich milk in cows, but it seems to me barley and cotton seed produce the best. Climate .—Muscat being situated in North Latitude 23‘38, and East Longi tude 58*36, is immediately under the tropic of Cancer, and probably comes within the first equatorial zone of the isothermal lines of Humboldt. Be this as it may, the Muscat climate possesses many peculiarities equally worthy of study. In order to acquire a correct knowledge thereof, it is necessary to follow the sun in its equinoctial changes, for its daily declination and that of the moon will be found to influence the atmospheric currents which modify the climate rather than any local causes. Thus when the sun’s declination reaches between 22 and 23 degrees North, the southern currents set in and blow from south east, which is no other than the south-west monsoon, directed in this direction by the abrupt turn at Ras-al-Hud. Of the highlands of the Arabian Coast, between which and that of Africa, it pursues its wild course to India. Again when the declination reaches as much south, the northern current sets in and blows from north, north-west, north and north-east, and each of these as they become exhausted are followed by land and sea breezes, or calm weather. These will be evident in the sequel as the seasons are reviewed. The climate of Muscat when spoken of, is usually defined into two grand divisions, the hot and cold weather. Nevertheless, the four seasons on careful observation are distinctly apparent, although their transition from one into the other is insidious, so as to be separable into two grand divisions. Winter. —November, December and January, during which the temperature is at the lowest standard of the year. The sky generally covered with cerri- cerro-cumuli, and strati clouds, which fade at night-fall and give place to heavy dews. Weather calm, with land and sea-breezes up to the first spring in December. New or full moon—when the northerly winds set in with heavy gales and squalls, preceded by the southerly, which, should the winter be propitious, is attended by heavy clouds, thunder, lightning and rain, whereby the temperature is reduced considerably, and the weather rendered fine and healthy, if otherwise, the temperature remains steady, and the season unhealthy. The northerlv winds having once commenced, it continues to blow from the north-west with varying severity uncil the next spring, when the southerly recurs, and blows from three to five days, with rain, &amp;c., to be succeeded by the north-westerly, which, however, frequently, prior to its being settled down, vacillates to north and north-east for a day or two. The northerly winds are dry and bleak, and the southerly warm and moist. The former maintains the Barometer at 30 inches, the latter depresses at 0*30. Spring .—February, March and Apiil, during which the temperature increases a little, slowly at first, then rapidly. Sky generally covered with cerri, and cerro-cumuli' clouds, with dews at night. The northerly and the southerly winds continue as in the winter, unless it be an exception, in which case clouds having collected by the south-east winds, at the north-west horizon, a squall may come from this point, and precipitate rain in pretty good showers ; sometimes the squall brings hail alone. This generally occurs about the end of March, or beginning of April as the springs may fall immediately the calm and oppressive weather follows, moderated at times by the land and sea breezes, the latter commencing late in the day and the former as late in the night, leave v8 the forenoon and evenings exceedingly oppressive, and the land breeze that proceeds from overheated rocks, makes night uncomfortable, and sleep impos sible. During the early part of this season, perennial plants blossom, and during the latter bear fruit, such as mangoes, dates, guavas, apricots, &amp;c. Summer. —May, June and July during which the temperature reaches the highest standard of the year, whereby new agents appear in the field. The great Arabian desert being overheated, sends scorching hot currents of winds, loaded with sand, from the westerly direction towards the sea and Muscat, under which the temperature rises 11G° Fahrenheit, and cumulus clouds overcast the sky. This, which is usually called the simoon, continues to blow with varying severity up to the beginning or the middle of June, when the south-east winds set in and blow with moderate force till each spring, when simoons reappear, and last from two to five days. The south-east winds being a wing of the great south-west monsoon, come charged with moisture that pervades the atmosphere in form of a haze or fog, and lower the temperature from 86° to 90° to the great relief of the people. During this season fruits ripen; Jassamine flowers, and to the Arabs a period of enjoyment occurs. Autumn. —August, September, and October during which the temperature falls, first slowly then rapidly but during the early part, as the monsoon grows weaker, prior to its final cessation, the weather becomes very oppressive and simoons come in about spring as powerful as in summer. On or about the 1st of September, the land and sea breezes set in with cloudy sky, indicating the approach of returning winter. During this season, dates are brought to market. The rule to be deduced from the foregoing is, that during the cold weather, the prevailing winds are the north-westerly up to each spring, when the south-easter ly blow from three to five days, and that during the hot, the reverse takes place. Both of these as they become exhausted, are followed by the land and sea breezes, and their setting in being sudden, give rise to atmospheric eddies in the form of gales, and squalls. This, as a rule, will invariably hold good, the excep tion is when the monsoon sets in early, as it did in 1865, about the 9th of May then the north-west too will set in earlier, about the first spring in November, or to express it better, at a point of corresponding declination of the sun, at which the monsoon commenced ; the exception however is rare, and appears to me to occur every five years, when the summer is more severe, and the winter more propitious. iikun.—Average number of rainy days being in 1863 10° 1864 7° and 1865 13°, may be recorded at 10° a year.

It seems to owe its generation to temperature ranging from 75° to 85,° and prevails in February, March, September and October, when the atmosphere acquires a peculiar epidemic state, giving rise to erysipelatous diseases, and disappears when the temperature ranges below 70° and above 85,° therefore the rains, and the simoons are looked upon by the Arabs as harbingers of healthy weather. This fever has five forms, some of which are malignant and fatal. Malaria .—The greatest bane of Muscat, need not be dwelt upon here at length. Sufficient it will be to say, that materials, or agents necessary for its generation are amply present. That its quantity depends on the presence of moisture on a barren porous soil, and height of temperature, that the absence of one or the other retards or prevents its formation, that therefore, unlike the other fever—the typhus—it is not destroyed by temperature beyond 85° and below 75°—that owing to generation to height of temperature it rages most severely in September, October, November, February, March and April; that at these periods it is likely to be confounded with typhus, that it produces fevers of all types and various neuralgic affections which keep time with spring— and that in many instances cause Andemia, enlarged Spleen, without febrile paroxysms. Cholera .—Is not common to Muscat, it is generally imported from Mecca during the great Hadge ; when the concourse of pilgrims is greater than at the ordinary Hadge. Now since the Cholera Sanitary laws are in operation, as agreed upon by Commission appointed by European Powers, it is to be hoped * A diagram shewing the annual and diurnal vaccillations of Barometer at Zanzibar, Muscat, and Mauritius, favored me by Professor Otto Kersten of Berlin, on my furnishing him with meteorological observations from Muscat, is appended, which will doubtless prove of interest in connection with the Meteorology of Muscat.10 * it will not appear again. The last time it visited Muscat was in Summer of 1865, when it caused great mortality, and darted through the length and breadth of Oman with incredible rapidity. Small Pox, Measles, and Hooping Cough prevail every year from December to April, and every third year with greater severity, and cause great mortality ; 1865, 1868, and 1871 were the last periods of their ravages. Vaccination .—After nine years haranguing and illustration, the people of Muscat have at last come to appreciate its benefit. It can be carried on with advantage from November to March only, as elevated temperature appears to deteriorate the quality of the vaccine matter. During the summer and early part of autumn, Muscat is free from sickness, save an occasional attack of malarious fever about the spring. But sundry cutaneous eruptions common to the tropics, such as Chafes, prickly heat, and boils prevail universally. The boils, owing to the depressing influence of heat, assume forms of carbuncles, ranged together in groups wherever they may appear, and cause great discomfort and pain. Diseases of Lungs, Bowel, and Liver prevail during the winter and spring. In conclusion it may be observed that the climate of Muscat is a prolific source of suffering, and that there is a continuous transition from one evil to another, which if combined with the debilitating influence consequent on the steady range of temperature, it will bo obvious that the strongest constitution must succumb, and bring about a premature old age and decay. Hence, too much attention cannot be paid to general Hygienic laws, and, I may add, that exercise is the best prophylactic, and that he who consumes the most Oxygen, will fare the best. G. ROZARIO. 'No. 65 of 1866. Political Department. From The Secretary to Government ; To The Secretary to the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, Simla. Bombay Castle, kth April 1866. Sir, In continuation of my letter No. 61 dated the 28th ultimo, I am directed to report the arrival at Bombay of two Envoys from Muscat with a letter from Syud Salim, a translation of which is enclosed for submission to His Excellency the Governor General in Council. 2. This letter I am desired to state does not touch on the causes of the late Sultan’s death, and from the information which has come in from a variety of sources, there can now, His Excellency the Governor in Council fears, be no longer much doubt that the story which first reached this Government of Sultan Thowenee having been murdered by his son Salim is in the main true. 3. It is, the Governor in Council concludes, out of the question for the British Government, while such a charge remains unrefuted, to continue with Syud Salim the relations of cordial friendship and alliance which have subsisted for so many years between the Sultans of Muscat and the British Government— nor for the present, at all events, to recognize him as even de facto ruler of his father’s dominions. 4. It is, I am directed to state, for the Government of India to decide whether any and what answer should be given to Syud Salim’s letter; but I am desired to submit that, as the Envoys sent by him appear from Colonel Disbrowe’s account (a copy of whose letter regarding them is appended) to be men of some position and trust under the late Sultan, the Secretary to Government should address them a letter acknowledging the receipt of that which they brought trom Syud Salim, reminding them of the friendship of the British Government with the late Sultan Syud Thowenee, and with his father Syud Sueed, and assuring them of the earnest desire of the British Government to continue on the same terms with every ruler of Muscat— But further stating “ that the Government of India had heard with feelings of the utmost horror and astonishment, that the late Sultan died, not from natural causes, but by the hand of an assassin and that his murder was insti gated if not effected by his own son.“ For a lous: time the Government of India was unable to believe in the truth of a crime so abhorrent to human nature, but it has been confirmed from such a variety of sources, that the Government of India is compelled to abstain from any renewal of its ancient relations of amity with Muscat. “ The Envoys, as old friends and servants of the late ruler, will easily un derstand that nothing is further from the desire of the British Government than to interfere in the domestic affairs of Muscat. The British Government wishes that all the various tribes of the province of Oman should be prosperous, united and happy, free from wars and foreign interference, and had no desire in assisting the late Sultan beyond the attainment of these objects. “ The British Government will require, from whoever may be ruler, the same protection and fair treatment of its subjects according to the laws of the country, which they have hitherto enjoyed in the Muscat territory. “ On this and on all subjects connected witn the affairs of Oman and of the Gulf, the Resident in the Gulf will be as heretofore the representative of the British Government, through whom all communications should be addressed.” 5. Some written communication to this effect, or in such other terms as the Government of India may think better calculated to prevent any misappre hension as to the character of our relations with Muscat, should the Governor in Council thinks be given to the Envoys. 6. It has been gathered from Colonel Felly, that all who were known to have any direct claim on the active interference of the British Government for their protection, have, as far as can be learnt, had an opportunity of leaving Muscat, and that there is no longer any object in sending any vessel to facilitate the removal of British subjects from that port. 7. For the future the points to be attended to seem to this Government to be:— 1st .—The security of the Telegraphic stations at Guadar and Mussendom. Znd .—The prevention of any renewal of piracy. 8. Intelligence has lately been received that the Steamer Amberwitch employed in connection with the Indo-European Telegraph, has broken down at Guadar, and probably requires to be docked for the repair of her boilers. The Steamer Berenice in the Persian Gulf, is also in great need of refitting and recruiting. 9. Colonel Felly’s health will not, the Governor in Council fears, stand anotnei hot season in the Persian Gulf, but he will be asked to return in II. M.’s Pantaloon, which Commodore Hillyar has intimated he is prepared to despatch to the Gulf, before she proceeds to her destination on the East Coast of Africa. 10. His Excellency in Council accordingly proposes to ask the Commo dore to allow the Pantaloon to proceed to Bushire taking Guadar and Mussendom pn route.11. Colonel Pelly will then be able to report whether any and what measures are requisite to ensure the safety of the Telegraph Stations and Esta blishments at both places, and he will be authorised to order at once anything which he may find immediately necessary, and capable of immediate execution. 12. The Governor in Council proposes to direct that the Gun boats Clyde and Hugh Rose should be made as efficient as possible as Guard vessels at the two Stations. Pending a decision of the Government of India (which has already been solicited in the Marine Department) as to the measures to be taken to give those vessels a recognised legal position; the Commodore will be asked to provide for their having the position of Tenders to one of the Men-of-war of his Squadron. This course is not free from serious inconvenience and objection, but the Governor in Council knows of no other which can give the vessels in question a legal position, and provide for the paramount necessity of giving some sort of Naval support to the Telegraph stations, during the season when the orders of the Admiralty will not admit of a Man-of-war remaining on the Persian Coast. 13. His Excellency in Council proposes this measure as merely tempo rary—the permanent provision to be made for the ordinary Police of those seas, being too important a subject to be treated incidentally. 14. Referring to para. 8 of this letter, I am desired to state that instruc tions will be given for sending the Steamer Coromandel in company with H. M.’s Pantaloon, taking such stores, &amp;c., as the Superintendent of Marine may be able to despatch for refitting and recruiting the Berenice and Amber witch. The Steamer Coromandel will be placed at the disposal of the Resident for employment in any way he may find necessary, in place of those two vessels, should they be compelled to leave the coast and return to Bombay to refit. 15. With respect to the Wahabee Envoys, Colonel Pelly will be instruct ed, should he find on arrival at Bushire that they are still awaiting an interview, to inform them that in the altered state of affairs at Muscat, all negotiations are for the present of necessity suspended—that this in no wise lessens the desire of the British Government to see all the Provinces which are under the sway of the late Sultan united and happy under such a ruler as the tribes themselves may approve and free from foreign interference. Colonel Pelly will at the same time be desired to remind the Envoys that the death of Syud Thowenee in no way alters the determination of the British Government to protect its own sub jects while trading in those seas, and to put down in the most prompt and decisive manner any attempt to break the Maritime Truce or to revive Piracy. 16. Finally, I am desired to request that the Government of India may be moved to intimate by Telegraph its approval of these instructions, or any alterations which His Excellency the Governor General in Council may wish to make in them. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) C. Gonne, Secretary to Government.No. 216 of 1866 . Persian Department, 22m/ March I860. Substance of a letter from His Highness Syud Salim, to His Excellency Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere, k. c. b., Governor of Bombay, dated 1th, and received and ordered to be translated on the 21s/ March 1866. After compliments. Further I sent by the Mail Steamer a letter to your Excellency, announc ing the death of my father at Sohar, and hope it has reached your Excellency. When Colonel Lewis Pelly returned from Khusp, I sent to him a letter in charge of my good friends Walee Nasir bin Ali and Hajee Abdoolla bin Abdool Kareem Jamal welcoming his arrival. I instructed my friends to communicate to him certain matters which I considered beneficial. He, however, did not reply to my letter and asked the bearers thereof whether the British subjects in Mus cat were safe. When Nasir bin Ali replied that all the British subjects and all their property would be quite safe and secure as before, Colonel Pelly desired a written proclamation to be issued to that effect. Accordingly I issued a procla mation without loss of time. I now enclose a copy thereof as also of the letter which I wrote to Colonel Pelly to let your Excellency know that I entertain greater feelings of friendship and unity towards the British Government than those entertained by my late father Thooenee and grandfather Sueed. On the 5th instant the Banians, who are British subjects, commenced removing their property from Muscat to vessels in the Harbour; and, as I did not know the rea son of these proceedings, I sent a message to Colonel Pelly requesting him to inform me of it. He replied that they were not safe at Muscat. When Nasir bin Ali informed him that the Banians would be more safe than before, and re quested him to give them orders to return to Muscat, he simply replied in answer to every thing said to him that an answer would come from your Excellency with Men-of-war. This reply is frightening, as I am under the protection of God and under that of your Excellency and the British Government. Colonel Pelly left Muscat on the evening of the 6th instant. It is said that he has gone to settle the Banians on the sea Coast. When I asked the Colonel for a receipt for the Banian Merchants and their property, he refused to give it. I deputed my friends Walee Mahomed bin Sooliman, Hamud bin Sueed bin Khulfan, and Hajee Sooliman bin Ahmed bin Issa to inform Colonel Pelly that, as he had removed the British subjects and their property from Muscat and without any reason and caused confusion in the city and refused to give a receipt for the merchants’ lives and property, I would not be responsible for the merchan-dize belonging to the merchants which was in the warehouses in Muscat. This message was communicated to the Colonel in the presence of the French and Persian Agents at Muscat. Notwithstanding this, out of respect for the British Government, I have ordered guards to be placed on the warehouses. With a view to inform your Excellency of every thing that has taken place here and to ask for justice and treatment similar to that given to my ancestors, I have thought it proper to depute Nasir bin Ali and Hamud bin Sueed bin Khulfan in my ship The Prince of Wales.

Sir, As requested in your letter, No. 65 dated 4th instant, I have this day conveyed to you by Telegraph the views of the Government of India as to the acknowledgment which should be given to the letter brought by the Muscat Envoys from Syud Salim to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay. 2. The right Honorable the Governor General in Council approves gene rally of the course which the Bombay Government proposes to adopt in this case. It is necessary that we should retain official relations with the de facto Government of Muscat. And it is well that our knowledge of the horrible sus- picion under which Syud Salim lies, and our consequent withdrawal from a posi tion of personal friendship with the Ruler to one of mere diplomatic courtesy towards the State, should be marked by the substitution of a letter to the Envoys from the public Secretary, instead of a reply under the hand of His Excellency the Governor to Syud Salim himself. Also it becomes the British Government to give expression to the abhorrence with which it has heard that the late Sultan Syud Thowenee was murdered. And lastly, the disturbed state of the country justifies an assertion at this time of our expectation that British subjects at Muscat shall continue to receive protection and fair treatment. 3. But in one point the Governor General in Council thinks it would be expedient to modify the terms of the proposed letter to the Envoys. Whatever may be the nature of Syud Salim’s present position in Oman, it is possible that hereafter he may consolidate his power, and that we may then have no option but to recognize him as Sultan. Having regard to this contingency, His Excellency in Council considers that the letter should avoid imputing to Syud Salim, either directly or indirectly, any share in the atrocious crime which he is believed to have perpetrated with his own hand. 4. The Government of India cannot pretend to forecast the issue of the existing crisis in the Persian Gulf, and therefore, in the opinion of the Governor General in Council, our policy should, for the present, be confined to a careful watching of the current of events and to the adoption of the best practicables . measures for securing the safety of the Telegraph Stations at Guadur and Mus- sendom. With a view to this latter object the proposed equipment of the Gun boats Clyde and Hugh Rose as tenders to Commodore Hillyar’s Squadron has the sanction of the Government of India. 5. The Governor General in Council is further pleased to approve the measure reported in your letter No. 66 dated 4th instant, viz. that Lieut.-Colonel Felly has been instructed to call at Guadur and Mussendom, on his way up the Persian Gulf, and make any arrangements at those Stations which may appear immediately requisite. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) J. W. S. Wyllie, Under-Secy, to the Govt, of India. Frov ToFrom The Secretary to the Government of India; To The Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Simla, the l%th April 1866. Sin, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter,'No. 61 dated the 28th ultimo and its enclosures, giving an account of the circumstance's connected with the late Sultan Syud Thowenee’s murder and submitting the views of the Bombay Government as to the attitude to be adopted towards Syud Salim, the present occupant of Muscat. 2. With reference to the 2nd para, of your letter, I am directed to observe that Lieut.-Colonel Felly’s judicious conduct in rescuing Syud Toorkee and removing British subjects with their property from Muscat, at a time w T hen they are understood to have been in considerable danger, has already obtained the acknowledgment of the Government of India. 3. My telegram and letter of the 11th instant will have already con veyed to the Bombay Government an outline of the principles which, in the opinion of His Excellency in Council, should regulate our policy towards the State of Muscat, as at present administered by Syud Salim. 4. From the fact of your letter No. 65 dated 4th instant containing as one of its enclosures a copy of a letter from Lieut.-Colonel Disbrowe, dated Bombay the 21st ultimo, it is inferred that that officer has not, as was formerly intended, returned to Muscat to resume charge of the Political Agency at that port. The Governor General in Council is not aware whether the course which the Bombay Government recommends, and which to a certain extent is approved by this Government, of suspending active interest in Muscat affairs is meant by the Bombay Government to extend to a withdrawal of the Political Agent. Such a step might compromise the maintenance of our influence on the coast of Oman, and therefore demands careful consideration before it can be adopted. If even tually it appears to admit of adoption, His Excellency in Council thinks that the Resident in the Persian Gulf should have a very intelligent Native Agent sta tioned at Muscat, who without the possession of any diplomatic powers, might be charged to watch and report the progress of affairs, and be the channel for the transmission of any ordinary communications from Syud Salim to the Resident.Before quitting this point I am desired to enquire whether the Political Agent at Muscat also holds Office as Her Majesty’s Consul. 5. Whatever may happen, the Governor General in Council regards it as a political necessity, that we should not by any abrupt abandonment of our lon^ established relations with the State of Muscat throw its Ruler under the influence of the French or any other foreign power. Nor must the suspension of friendly relations with the person of Syud Salim be made equivalent to the abrogation of our treaty obligations towards his people. 6. With regard to those British subjects who may elect to stay in Muscat territory, His Excellency in Council entirely concurs in the views of the Bombay Government as expressed in the 4th and 5th paragraphs of your letter under reply. 7. Referring to your last paragraph, I am to observe that the tone in which the Government of India would wish the overtures of the Wahabee Envoy to be received, has been already intimated to the Bombay Government by my telegram of the 11th instant. 8. lam directed to take this opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 54 dated 23rd ultimo. It appears to call for no reply. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) W. Muir, Secretary to the Government of India.No. 96 of 1866. Political Department. From The Secretary to Government; ) To The Secretary to the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, Simla. Bombay Castle, 30^ April 1866. Sir, I have received and laid before His Excellency the Governor in Coun cil your letters noted in the margin, communicat ing the views of the Government of India as to the reply to be given to the letter brought by the Muscat Envoys, and as to the attitude to be adopted towards Syud Salim the present occupant of Muscat. 2. I am now desired to forward for approval a draft of the reply pro posed to be given to the Envoys, drawn up in accordance with the views expressed by the Government of India. 3. Referring to the 4th para, of your letter No. 361 of the 18th instant, I am desired to state that Lieut.-Colonel Disbrowe was appointed Consul at Muscat by notification in the London Gazette of the 30th June 1863, and still holds his Consular Commission. 4. I am desired to state further that Colonel Disbrowe’s health appears to have entirely broken down by long residence in the Persian Gulf and at Muscat. He is at present in Bombay effecting a settlement of some Telegraphic Accounts, after which, he has intimated, he proposes to send in a medical certificate. 5. His Excellency in Council is sure that Colonel Disbrowe is quite willing to go any where Government may require him, but there is reason to fear that another hot season at Muscat would seriously endanger his life. 6. Instead therefore of sending to Muscat any British Officer who must of necessity be quite new to the situation, and who might not at present be quite safe without support from a Man-of-War, the Governor in Council proposes toauthorise Colonel Felly to depute a well-chosen Native Assistant, such as is described by the Government of India, as Consular Agent for purely Com- mercial purposes. 7. On the approval by the Government of India of the appointment of such an Agent, His Excellency in Council is of opinion that the Merchants trading with Muscat might be informed of the appointment, and that there will he no objection to their resuming their commercial dealings at their own risk. 8. The Governor in Council would add this last phrase ‘at their own risk,’ only in deference to what are understood by this Government to be the wishes of the Government of India. 9. But it is not without a feeling of something more than regret that His Excellency in Council contemplates the possibility of any Merchant for the first time during many generations being under any apprehension that he may be insulted or wronged in the State of Muscat while pursuing legitimate com merce under the British Flag, and that he may look in vain to the British Government for redress. 10. His Excellency in Council deems it his duty to represent this tn the Government of India as a state of things as little consistent with permanent safety as with a due regard for our National character. 11. On this subject, I am desired to forward herewith copies of Memo rials received from British Indian Merchants trading with Muscat and the Persian Gulf. 12. I am at the same time directed to solicit the notice of the Govern ment of India to the fact, that there are no Vessels of War under the orders either of the local Government or of the Government of India, and that the orders of the Admiralty forbid the Commodore Commanding H. M’s Naval forces in these Seas to keep a Man-Of-War in the Persian Gulf during tho hot weather. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., , .(Signed) C. Gqnne, Secretary to Government.Political Depaktment.

The Government of India have heard with feelings of the utmost horror and astonishment, a report that the late Sultan died not from natural causes but by the hand of an Assassin. t ;• 7f? Government of India trusts that steps have been taken to test the truth of this report and if necessary to bring the guilty to justice. 4 I have only to recall to your recollection the steady friendship that has at all times subsisted between the British Government and the late Sultan Syud Thowenee, and his father Syud Saeed before him, to assure you of the earnest desire of the British Government to continue on the same terms of friend- ship with every Ruler of Muscat. 5. The British Government will expect from the Sultan of Muscat the •same protection and fair treatment of its subjects according to the laws of the country which they have hitherto enjoyed in the Muscat territory. 6. On this and on all subjects connected with the affairs of Oman and the Persian Gulf, the Resident in the Gulf will be as heretofore the representa- live of the British Government, through whom all communications should be addressed.

Sir, Dated Simla, the llth May 1866. Having laid before the Governor General in Council your letter, and its enclosures, No. 96 dated 30th ultimo, I am directed to intimate that His Excellency in Council approves of the reply which the Bombay Government propose to give to the Envoys from Muscat, and authorizes the substitution of a Native Agent at that place, as a temporary arrangement, in the place of a British Officer. 2. His Excellency in Council further authorizes intimation being given to Merchants trading with Muscat that they may resume their commercial dealings if they think proper, with that Port; and that the Government does not anticipate that they will be at any serious risk in doing so. But that these Merchants must judge for themselves as to the probabilities of peace and security for the present in Muscat. 3. On this last point I am to observe that the intentions of the Govern ment of India appear in some degree to have been misapprehended by the Government of Bombay. It does not follow, because the Government of India declines to guarantee security to the inhabitants of British India trading with Muscat, that these people, in the event of any of them being maltreated in M uscat, would have to look in vain for redress to the British Government. On the contrary any breach of Treaty, any violation of the friendly relations which have hitherto subsisted with the State of Muscat, would certainly obtain from the British Government such notice as the particular case might appear to demand. 4. But the object of the Government of India is that these Merchants shall clearly understand that, from the present condition of affairs in Muscat, over which the Government of India has no adequate control, there is some danger to them and to their Agents, if they decide on returning to that Port. 5. The Government of Bombay is well aware that the Government of India cannot remedy this state of things in Muscat: and that it has not .at its command Vessels of War which, at this season of the year, can be employed in the Gulf.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No. 140. dated the 30th June last, I am directed to report that His Excellency the Governor in Council has ascertained that Agha Mahomed Bauker Khan, the present Consul for Muscat in Bombay, is willing to accept the office of Native Agent at Muscat, under the orders of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. His Excellency in Council is unable to suggest a more eligible Mahomedan Gentleman of the qualifications described in paragraph 3 of your letter No. 523 of the 21st May, and would have at once nominated Mahomed Banker Khan, but as the Govern ment of India interposed its veto on the previous nomination by this Government of Mr. Rozario, His Excellency in Council considers it desirable to obtain the approval of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council before any fresh appointment is made. 3. Mahomed Bauker Khan is the son of a Mahomedan Gentleman, who arrived in Bombay many years ago as Envoy from Futteh Alh Shah, King of Persia, to the Indian Government, and Agha Mahomed Bauker Khan possesses authentic copies of complimentary letters from Mr. N. B. Edmonstone, Secretary in attendance on the then Governor General, to the Envoy’s address. 4 Acrha Mahomed Bauker Khan has, for about forty years past, been engaged in trade in Bmnbay, chiefly with Muscat and the Persian Gulf, and is well known and respect ed amono- both the European and Mahomedan community in Bombay. He has for some vears been Consul for Muscat. He was appointed by the late Syud Thoweynee, but he has informed His Excellency in Council that he has received complimentary letters and presents from Syud Salem, to whom therefore this Government presume his appointment will not be distasteful* 5. He is a man apparently about 60 years of age, with a very pleasing manner and address, and speaks English as well as his own language, Arabic and Persian fluently. He has lately been to Europe and visited London and Paris, where he states, he has an uncle in the receipt of a large pension from the British Foreign Office for services rendered to the British Mission in Persia. 6.

GONNE, Secretary to Government.•9k» Minute by His Excellenxy the Governor, Dated the bth June 18(36. As the responsibility of such a nomination as the Government of India have cancelled rests with the President of the Honorable Board, I should wish to submit to the Government of India, in reply to this letter, that I should not have Mi&lt;&gt;-&lt;;ested or approved of Mr. Rozario’s appointment, nor directed him to join at Muscat, had I not felt every contidence, after consulting with Officers to whom he was well known, that he was a suitable person to perform the duty which l believed the Government of India required at Muscat. I understood that the Government of India desired us to select a discreet and thoroughly trustworthy person, acquainted with the people and the language, who could transact ordinary consular duties, and who might be trusted to attempt nothing more than to discharge such duties, to keep this Government informed of all matters of public notoriety, and if need be, to be the mere channel for trans mitting letters and other communications between the Government of Muscat and the Government of Bombay. Such a person 1 believe Mr Rozarioto be. For many years our only Agents at Muscat were first an Armenian and then a Jewish Merchant, and the duty was fairly well done till our more intimate relations with the Sultan made it desirable to appoint a British Officer. It is observed in paragraph 2 of Mr. Muir’s present letter: “It may be that Mr. Rozario is a man of ability and character, but no- thino’ is said to this effect.” I really should have supposed it quite superfluous for us to have added any general certificate of ability or character to the tele graphic statement that Mr. Rozario was recommended to us, as “the best Native Ao-ent,” I should have hoped that the Government of India would have trusted us°not to have appointed any one whom we had supposed to be deficient in-these respects, and bearing in mind the exhortations we occasionally receive not to burden the Electric Telegraph with unnecessary details, it was not an unreason able hope, that we might have been called on to supply by post, any deficiency of telegraphic information rather than that deficiency of ability or character in our nonunee should have been taken for granted from our silence on these points. I believe that Mr. Rozario in point of ability and character and general high esteem among all classes at Muscat, would compare not unfavourably with many of the Consular Agents who represent the British Government in the ports of the Levant; as to his being an Apothecary, I have known a Bombay Assistant Sur geon highly honored by his own and other sovereigns as an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at a Foreign Court for many years. Still I must admit that had I been seeking for a complete representative of the British Government in the sense in which an Envoy ought to represent it, 1 should have wished for some one with higher rank than that of Apothecary. But, as I understand the duty required, the British Government was not to be represented in any such sense, or in any sense which could make the character or dignitv of the British Government depend on the character or dignity of the British Agent. Mr. Rozario would I believe have had nothing to do, save such duties as he has heretofore frequently discharged at Muscat with ability, propriety and dis cretion during the absence of the Political Agent. When lately Mr. Rozario was alone in the Residency, just before he was withdrawn from Muscat by Colonel Pellv he had shown great courage and discretion, and had saved the life of the late Sultan’s Minister who took refuge in his house, and this without giving offence to Syud Salem. Medical Officers of exactly the same grade, carefully2 selected of course for their conduct and intelligence, have for many years past rendered similar service at the Zanzibar Agency. Among Mahomedans the Medical profession, even in the grade of an English Apothecary, is highly esteemed, and in the case of a man otherwise worthy, as I believe Mr. Rozario to be, is always treated with respect. V 1 I mention these particulars to justify the original appointment which, as inti mated to the Government of India, was made with the entire concurrence of Colonel Felly, who well knew Mr. Rozario’s high character and the esteem in which he is held at Muscat. We must now if possible send either a Mahomedan gentleman or a British Officer in compliance with the wishes expressed by the Government of India, but I would observe that very few Mahomedan gentlemen could be entirely trusted in the present position of affairs at Muscat, not to lend themselves to intrigues, either in favor of, or against, the present ruler, and a British Officer in such a position, even if one could entirely assure his safety, would require unusual judgment and experience to keep him to the simple duty required, and prevent his doing either somewhat more or somewhat less than the Govern ment of India wish. There is some danger of his representing, perhaps somewhat too faithfully, the British Government in its weaknesses as well as in its strong- points. It is difficult for any but a man of considerable experience in such pos£ tions to avoid diplomatising on a small scale, and either taking up the cause of the present ruler or viewing him as an usurper, and favouring, perhaps uncons ciously, the views of other possible aspirants to power. It is much more easy to' flatter and cajole a young English Officer in such a position, than a man like Mr. Rozario, and much more easy to affront or insult him. He becomes inevit ably a diplomatic, instead of being, what *1 understand is wanted, a commercial Agent. It will however be my duty if I can, to find a fit person of one or other of the classes indicated by the Government of India in paragraph 3 , for I should be sorry to be reduced to the alternative presented in paragraph 4 ; whatever may be the rights, or crimes of the present Ruler there is no doubt he has from the first maintained order, and he is probably well aware that we know this; and such be ing the case, I cannot think that it would raise his opinion of us to write to him in the terms indicated at the close of paragraph 4; merely because we found it difficult to select a Mahomedan gentleman for the post of native Agent, or because there was some risk to the life of a British Officer. On this latter point I would submit that though it is undoubtedly true as observed, paragraph 3rd,, that a British u Officer ought to be as safe at Muscat as Apothecary Rbzario,” the facts before us prove that there are special dangers there at present to all who may be obnoxious to the present ruler and who l?ave no hold on his feai of retribution. Our Political Officers in lawless countries are always in some danger of their lives, and if we withdrew them from every post where there was possible risk of assassination, our diplomatic service would be a very much smaller one than it is. There can be no doubt that in such positions a British Officer's safety depends partly on his own conduct and bearing, and partly on the certainty which all about him feel that any insult or injury to him will be promptly and severely avenged. On the subject of paragraph 5 of Mr. Muir’s letter, I would submit that we Lud otfore.the Go\einment of India no question as to Air. Rozario’s appointment. He had been appointed by this Government and had been ordered to join at Muscat in the belief that the Government of India desired the Government of Bombay to select the best man, a\1io could be got for a certain subordinate dutv, an d that this had been done; the only point on which instructions were requested, was whether the Native Agent should hoist a Flag and recognize Syud Salem! and on this point also the Government of Bombav would not have asked for instructions, had they been clearly aware whether tlie Government of India wished Syud Salem so recognized or not.The conclusion of paragraph 3 of the present letter is now explicit on this point though in paragraph 4 the full recognition of the Ruler, and the restoration of our old relations with Muscat, are made to depend less on the intrinsic merits of the case than on the ability of this Government to find a Mahomedan gentleman qualified as Agent or our power to insure the life of a British Officer. 1 would respectfully submit to the Government of India that when we distinct ly understand the position they wish the British Government to hold towards the Ruler of Muscat, we shall have little difficulty in carrying out their orders, if thev would leave to us the choice of Agents and the consequent responsibility for their subsequent conduct. I should wish copies of this Minute to be submitted to the Government of India and Secretary of State as explanatory of the circumstances under which and the reasons for which Mr. Rozario was nominated. (Signed) H. B. E. FRERE. Minute by the Honorable Mr. Erskine, • Dated the \Q&gt;th June 1866. For reasons to which His Excellency the Governor has alluded, I fully concurred in the proposal that Mr. Rozario should be instructed to act as British Agent at Muscat, during the interruption of regular diplomatic relations with that Court. The duties which were thus to be entrusted to Mr. Rozario are of a humble kind, and would best be performed by a person whose presence would not be likely to give rise to suspicion or remark. Mr. Rozario had been favorably known at Muscat for years as Medical Officer of the British Agency and, on former occasions, during the absence of the Political Agent, had habi tually conducted in a satisfactory^ manner the routine duties of the office, and seemed a very suitable person for the temporary duty. Government were assured by those who had the best opportunities of forming an opinion, that in their judgment a better Agent could not then be recommended; and I share therefore in the regret with which His Excellency the Governor has learned that the Government of India have thought it necessary to express their disapproval of the arrangement. For many reasons, I thi^k it would be impolitic to send a British Officer to Muscat at present, and I have no expectation of finding a suitable Mahomedan Agent in Bombay. (Signed) 0. J. ERSKINE. Minute by the Honorable Mr. Ellis, Dated the 11 th June 1866. Most assuredly I would not send a British Officer to Muscat till we can send one on tln^old footing, his position would under existing circumstances be a false one; nor have I much hope of finding a suitable representative among the class from which the Government of India desire the Agent to be selected. Even if a suitable representative were found, I think, for the reasons stated by His Excellency the President, that the nomination would be less expedient than that of Mr. Rozario. I should not have deemed Mr. Rozario a good selection as a4 u Diplomatic” Agent, but it was not for diplomacy that he was selected, and I con sider that for the duties, which, as a simple Consular Agent, he would have to perform, Mr. Rozario was fully competent, according to the concurrent testimony of all under whom he has served. As he is known favorably to the Ruler and people of Muscat there was every prospect of his services in this capacity being most useful to our subjects, and I regret that the Government ot India have thought fit to interpose and veto his appointment.

Submits copy of a letter from the Acting Political Agent, Muscat, concerning the alleged imprisonment of a British subject by the Walee of Mutrah and of his reply thereto. Resolution. —It appears that with refeience to the question of protection there are two principal points for consideration, viz., . 1 st. What does protection involve with regard to the entitled to it ?, and 2 nd, what persons are so entitled ? persons The answers to these two questions must to a certain extent vary in chfter- ent localities according to existing Treaties and local usage. 2 . With regard to the 1 st point it is to be observed that when a person in Foreign Territory is entitled to protection as a British subject, his position involves both privileges and duties. So that while on the one hand lie may enjoy total or partial exemption from the jurisdiction of Native Courts and myv be entitled to be sheltered from injustice and oppression, on the other hand he may on account of his recognition as a British subject become exposed to penal ties (e. g. in connection with the slave trade) to which as the subject of a Native State he would not have been liable. In any case it seems necessary to lay down a clear rule on the subject so that persons claiming British protection may understand that they cannot obtain the privileges without at the. same time taking upon themselves the duties of British subjects. 3. The general principles involved in the 2 nd question have been discus sed in the correspondence regarding the Muscat Lootyans, which accompanied Government Circular No. 2018 of 20 th June 1862. It was then decided that these Lootyans as a class were not British subjects. But it appears from Colonel Belly’s report No. 75—41 of 23rd April last, that there are still persons regard ing whose nationality there is a difficulty. In his paragraph 4 he says, “ there are numerous traders residing in the Muscat Territories who claim to be British subjects, but whom the Muscat Government have not always recognized as such, and whose nationality has not in so far as I am aware been resolved on by#our Government.” 4. It is very important that the position of such persons should b* determined as soon as possible ; and that the Register of British subjects shou bear the names of those persons only to whom Government is prepared withe further question to extend British protection when occasion arises. In settl’ the Register care should be taken to reduce the protected persons to the 1 q* number consistent with justice to individuals; and without very good re protection should not be renewed to any person who has once abandone It should also be borne in mind that while it is of little consequence so ft the interests of Government are concerned whether any particular indivi is recognized as a British subject or not, it is of great importance that irrita controversies between British Officers and the local native authorities on subject of disputed nationality should be avoided. 5. Before issuing general instructions the Political Resident in f Persian Gulf, the Political Resident at Aden and the Political Agent Zanzibar, should be requested to report on the two points stated in paragrapl of this Resolution.

No. 36 op 1866. From, Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis Pelly, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Resident, Persian Gulf. To, C: Gonne, Esquire, Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, 1 have the honor to acknowledge your letter No. 2329 of the 1st instant, relative to the recognition of Syud Saulem as Sultan of Muscat. The previous letter No. 523 of the 21 st May last, which you refer to as having been already communicated to me, has not reached me, and I would solicit the favor of a copy. 2 . In obedience to the instructions now acknowledged, I proceeded to Muscat, and arriving here on the 10 th instant, recognized Syud Saulem as Sultan of Muscat, in the usual form. Syud Saulem was desirous that I should, in the first instance, pay him a visit of condolence on the death of his late lamented father. I explained that my present instructions did not go quite so far as this, but that if he so desire 1 , it would be my duty to refer the question. Syud Saulem waved the pretension, the recognition took place, and the English Flag was hoisted at the Consulate. Syud Saulem has handed me two letters, which he has received from the Wahabee Ameer, expressing good will, and a desire to renew previous friendly relations. The Ameer appears in these commu nications to discountenance his Lieutenant at Beraymee, and desires relations direct with the Sultan. This is so far satisfactory. 3. It is now very agreeable to me to be able to report that the problems proposed to me by Government last autumn, are completely solved. The Waha- bees have desisted from their measures for destroying the Government of our Ally, the Sultan of Muscat. The Wahabee troops have letired from the Muscat territory. The Wahabee Ameer has sent Envoys to apologize for injuries done to our subjects; has given written assurances of not again molesting our Ally; has apologized for injuries already committed; and has submitted, in brief, to every condition which the Government of India permitted me to require. Those who injured our subjects at Soer have been punished, and the Sultan of Muscat now starts a fresh as Master within his own frontiers, so far as external enemies are concerned. And if Government should feel satisfied with this general result, I shall not regret any little inconvenience which may have befallen me in restoring affairs within the jurisdiction of the Political Agent for the Muscat territories. 4 . The Government of India having, however, found occasion during the course of my proceedings, to censure me, I would now, on the conclusion of my mission, most repectfully recapitulate the points of censure. The Government of India considered:— 1 st —That my attack on Soor followed too closely on my letter of demand for reparation, that letter being dated 11 th February. But I would deferentially submit that in a more recent letter the Viceroy in Council has, I believe, stated that his condemnation was based prin-' V 4 2 %gr f respectfully remark that in para^iaph o o n l d e tched ifHi Taninrv I had informed Government that 1 haa clespatcncu Her Maiest/s Steamer “Berenice” with a letter of demand to the Soorees, and had submitted a copy of that letter in extenso as an appendix. 2 ^—The Government of India considered that to make a demand for compensation for the property plundered from our subjects by the Wahabees was inexpedient. But I would respectfully remark that in a more recent letter the Govern- mint of 3 a have ruled, that I should have d.scret.onary power m making this demand. 3 r d.—The Government of India considered that my letter to the ahabce Ameer, demanding an apology for the outrages commi e&lt; on our subjects, and written assurances that no similar outrages and hatcher ies should, in future, take place, was exaggerated and ill-judged. But under correction, I would remark that the event has shewn that while theWahabee Ameer had treated all previous demands on the part of the British authorities with silent indifference, he yielded to mv demand, and sent Envoys to wait on me at Lushire, who acquiesced, not only in the demands I made, but further gave written assurances of refraining from molesting our Allies tor the futuie. And as these negotiations were carried on with the knowledge ot the Government of India, I venture to hope that His Excellency in Council eventually deemed the demands to be reasonable, and the ^ I w I x /-»/-v ^ n a /'4 ±ih, The Government of India censured me for not accompanying the “ Highflyer” to Dammaum, and added that if I could not go then, I should have postposed her departure until I could go. t 3 ut more recently, and without any suggestion on my part, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, in communication with the Viceroy in Council, has appointed two Assistants for my Establishment on the specitied ground ot their being needed for going on board ships-of- w r ar, thereby recognizing, I venture to infer, the impracticability of the Resident, left to himself, fulfilling such duties. While in a subsequent letter Government declare that the vessels-of-war ate not under the orders, either of the local Government, or of the Government of India, and that the orders of the Admiralty forbid the Commodore Commanding Her Majesty’s Naval Forces in these Seas, from keeping a Man-of-war in the Bersian Gulf in the hot weather. Sth. The Government of India implied that I had no authority to use force—that my duty was to report. But I would respectfully submit that I had enquired and reported and expostulated during months, and that when I myself found, and when I saw that Government acknowledged that all gentle means were vain, I submitted, six weeks before any force was used, a letter summarizing the course I proposed to pursue, and begging that if any thing were to be said, 1 might be favored with a Telegram. I received a ship-of-wnr. Her Commander held authority to use force, and a Telegram from Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India authorized me, in concert with the Senior Naval Officer, to take such measures instrumental, as I might think likely to promote an arrange ment between the Wahabee Chief and the Imaum, but not to under take any thing by land. We3 §th .—The Government of India held that I had placed my own interpre tation on our Treaty relations with the Sultan of Muscat; whereas a letter, dated 1 st February 1834, and documents therein referred to, showed that we are not liable to afford the Sultan active aid. I respectfully submit that the Second Article of our Treaty with Muscat runs as follows:—From the recital of the said Nawab my heart has become disposed to an increase of the friendship with that State, and from this day forth, the friend of that Sirkar is the friend of this, and the friend of this Sirkar is to be the friend of that Sirkar, and in the same way the enemy of this is to be the enemy of that.” I was unable to understand this Article otherwise than as committing the contracting parties to a defensive and offensive alliance—an interpre tation, I would remark, which seems to receive some support from a letter of the Government of India, written only in April last, and declaring it to be a political necessity “ that we should not ***** throw the Ruler of Muscat under the influence of the French or any other Foreign Power.” Again as regards the letter of 1834, I would submit that the balance of authority before me, was as follows:— A Book of Treaties published' under authority last year, containing the above Second Article, but making no allu sion to the unpublished letter of 1834. A Minute by his Excellency in Council, stating “our inten tion scrupulously to fulfil our Treaty Engagements.” That I was sent to the Muscat Sultan’s side, I reported pro- ceedings and intentions. \ , An ublislled letter of 1834 . received instructions from the r Secretary of Stat£, authoriz ing me, in concert with the Naval Authorities, to use measures instrumental, pro vided, 1 attempted nothing by land. A ship-of-war ar rived. Her Commander had permission to use force. The occasions for force were the perseverant invasion of our Ally; threatening him from day to day with destruction; and the plunder and butchery of our own subjects. I would respectfully submit to Government whether, if, sheltering myself under the unpublished letter of 1834, I had sent back their ship-of- war, declined to aid the Sultan, and allowed him (as he assuredly would have been) to be crushed by the Wahabees, whether Govern ment would have approved my proceedings? . ill i %5. In conclusion, I have had the honor of serving Government beyond their , „ T Frontiers, in many capacities, t “ 8 „fTX° r; r Tlhr„ 0utram “ ^ «»&lt;« ^l-aps few who have not As Charge d’affaires at Teheran. gone through this (JeSCliptlOn On special duty through Persia and Afghanistan. of service, can thoroughly ap- On special duty to tin Comoro Islands. predate what climates, banish- £ Ea6t C ° aSt 0f AfriCa - and roughing it involves. 1 he reward of an Omeer so serving lies in the recognition of his Government, and I trust that, on a full review of my proceedings in relation to Muscat and the Wahabees, His Excellency the Viceroy in Council may decide that I have endeavouied to do my duty.

Resolution.— The Consul at Muscat has found Abdoola Mahomed guilty of buying and selling a slave, but reserves judgment pending the decision of the High Court on the question whether he is subject to the Consul’s jurisdiction. ^ The Court of the Consul at Muscat is in many ways subordinate to the Hio-h Court at Bombay, but Government cannot find any.

However, the papers should be put in the hands of the Advocate General, who should be requested, through the Government Solicitor, either to take himself the necessary steps for bringing the question before the High Court, oi to advise Government as to the steps which should be taken by them. In the event of the High Court declining to pass any order on the case, the Advocate General should be requested to give his own opinion for the guidance of the Consul.

Forwards copy of a letter addressed to him by the Resident Persian Gulf, and reports, with reference to the doings of Syud Salem at Debaee, that, although news has reached Muscat from Bunder Abbass that His Highness left Debaee on the 7th instant at the head of about 3,000 men to attack Muscat, no intelligence of the kind has reached by land, and there is no reason whatever in his opinion to suppose that he will get any effectual assistance from Bereymee, the Wahabee outpost in Oman. Observes, with reference to the action taken by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in ordering the gun-boat “ Hugh Rose” to proceed with or without Captain Way, 1st Assistant Resident, to the Muscat Coast “ to co-operate with him (the Acting Political Agent) in protecting British interests and maintaining peace at sea,” that these instructions seem to point to a double or divided authority and therefore to a divided responsibility. Earnestly trusts that Government will, after taking into consideration the request submitted by him in his letter No. 528 of 1868 into consideration, either direct Captain Way to return to his own proper post, or place him at his (the Acting Political Agent’s) disposal while employed within his political jurisdiction. Resolution.— His Excellency in Council thinks it should be understood by Colonel *Pelly that the First Assistant to the Resident, Persian Gulf, when at Muscat must be subordinate to the Political Agent at Muscat, except in so far as he may be fulfilling the direct orders of the Resident. If not, either there would be a divided authority and possibly a conflict of authority, or the Political Agent at Muscat would be under a subordinate Officer. Secretary to Government.

It must he a Robbery upon the Hish Seas.—A. robbery committed in any other Place such as on the Sea Shore, or in a Creek, Harbour, Port or River within the Presidency, becomes subject to the Jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts, and the case should be handed up to them accordingly. If on the other hand it take place in any Port or River &amp;c. without the limits of the Presidency, the Supreme Court has Jurisdiction over the case. 2nd. The Robbery must take place in and on board some Ship, Boat, or other Vessel, and a Rob bery or other act of Violence committed on Shore by the Crew of a Vessel who land for the purpose, will not come under the denomination of Piracy. 3rd. The Parties robbed must be Subjects of the East India Company, or of a State or States in ami ty with them. The Subjects of an Enemy do not come within the protection of the British Laws, and it should be observed, that if a capture atSea be made under the due authority of any Sovereign Power, or State, it will not be Piracy. 4th. The Parties robbed must have been put in bodily fear, and some Property must be actually stolen and taken away. 5th. In examining into a case of Piracy the gratest care should be taken to keep the chain o( Evi dence unbroken, so that each circumstance likely to appear on the Lrial, may be connected with the particular act under investigation. With reference to this, the first consideration is the identity of the Persons taken, with those con cerned not in acts of Piracy generally, but in the particular act in question. Piracies being generally perpetrated at night, the injured Parties are almost always too much alarmed, to recognize at a future period, the Persons by whom they have been robbed; besides which the plundered Boat being suffered to continue her voyage, those who have been robbed are often taken to a distance from the place where the Pirates are apprehended, and before the injured Parties can be met with to identify the Pirates as the Persons who robbed them (and which they generally are enabled to do only by recognizing their Property) the chain of Evidence which connects the property recognized with that found in the pos session of the Pirates at the time of their capture is broken. On the capture of Pirates therefore some Person should immediately make a list of the property, if any found in their possession, and put such a mark to each article as will enable that Person at a future day to say “ I was present at the capture of these Persons, and recognize by my mark the Property now before me, as that which l found in their possession,” and in all cases where property connected with the case comes into the possession of any Party, that individual should immediately take such precautions, as will enable him to distinguish it, when shewn to him at a future period trom other articles ot a similar description. 6th. No time should be lost after the apprehension of the Pirates in ascertaining what has become of the Vessel robbed, and in obtaining her name, and the names and residences of the Passengers and Crew, who when found, should be questioned as to the circumstances ot the Robbery md asked, it they can recognize the Robbers or their Property. 7th. By attention to the above suggestions, it is conceived, that little danger need be apprehended ofa tailure of Justice, more especially in those cases in which the Criminals are taken by Europeans with the plunder in their possession, because there must be always those on board Vessels of the Indian Navy, or other Vessels manned by Europeans, who can be brought forward, as well to establish the identity of the Prisoners, as to verity all the other circumstances ot the case. But regard to those cases which more commonly occur where having been taken by other parties, the I 1 rate* are afterwards delivered up to the Officers of Government for Trial; it frequently turns out, that the Pirates have been apprehended 0.1 suspicioi some time alter committing an act of Piracy, and that they either admit the tact of their having been engaged in plunder, or that from other circumstances no doubt can exist of their guilt. It is under such circumstances that the greatest care is required, lest the apparent clearness of their Guilt, should, by inducing neglect of the precautions above suggested, oc casion the want of some link of the Evidence to prove the particular act of Piracy, with which the Pri soners are charged.Stores.— Coal, Persian Gulf and Kurrachee.

T. of the 12th ultimo, giving cover to copy of a Despatch, No 13 dated the 3rd idem, addressed to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State reo-ardin^ Muscat Affairs. ° 3 2. From this Despatch His Excellency in Council has for the first time become awaie that the instructions of this Government, conveyed to Colonel 1 elly by telegraph on the 9th of January last, were not at once communicated by telegraph to the Government of India. It is the established rule that all telegrams of importance should be immediately repeated to Calcutta. The rule was unfor tunately not acted on in the present instance through an oversight in the Secre tariat, and the absence of the Political Secretary on tour with His Excellency the Governor in Guzerat no doubt led to the omission remaining unnoticed at the time. His Excellency in Council desires to express his great regret that this error should have occurred. At the same time he feels it his duty to point out that the Government of India are scarcely accurate in stating that the instructions of the 9th of January last have never been reported to the Government of India, * “Resolution -The reply to Major Way’s question as to permitting Muscat 'T W( T e Cmb °* Government to send an expedition against Soor by sea must be in the negative.

WES forwarded to r „ , . , . . . . , ^ Calcutta on the 4th of February last in the Abstract of Proceedings for the month of January 1871. 3. But even if these instructions had not been communicated to the Government of India, His Excellency in Council cannot but express his surprise that the Right Honorable the Viceroy in Council should have deemed it necessary to make such an omission a ground of complaint to Her Majesty s Secretary of State, without in the first instance affordin 0 ' to this Government an opportunity for explanation. Even in the case of subordinato Oftcers it is not customary to pass censure without first asking for an explanation. And where a Local Government is concerned it appears that a departure from this s;ilutaiy piactice. must necessarily produce misunderstandings, and impair those cordial relations which should exist between the Supreme and the Local Governments. In the present instance if the explanation of this Government had been asked for, the. Government of India would not have assumed that the omission was intentional, and an oversight in the Secretary’s Office would not have become the ground for a serious representation to the Home Authorities. 4. From a similar cause His Excellency in Council has been placed at a disadvantage with reference to the instructions recently issued by him re^ardino Muscat affairs. For he has now learnt for the first time that the proceedings ol* this Government have not been approved. The course taken by His Excellency in Council was not adopted without due care and consideration, and the circumstauces will presently be set forth in detail. But what I am here directed W f % i v K ft2 reason to point out is that His Excellency in Council conceives that he has just lea for complaint when his proceedings are condemned without due consideration o his grounds of action. It would have been easy for the Government of Ind a to have ascertained from this Government the ground on which the instructions to Colone Felly of the 9th of January last were based, but they have preferred themselves to supply the reasons, and then to condemn the action of the Bombay Governmen . because those reasons are invalid. Thus in paragraph 5 of the Despatcn it is stated as followsThe ground upon which the Bombay Government appeals to have based its instructions is that as a state of war had broken out in Muscat, we were bound to maintain a neutral position between the combatants and to pievent Syed Azan from doing for his own defence what we would not permit byed Toorkee to do for purposes of aggression.” But it appears to have escaped the notice of the Government of India that the reference to winch the orders were a reply was for instructions in case an attempt was made, not to defend Muttra, but to drive out Sved Tookee from Soor by aggressive operations from sea-ward. \nd if the Ri'*ht Honorable the Viceroy in Council had been pleased to refer to Government Resolution No. 184 of the 14th of January last, (vide paragraph 2 of this letter), it would have been apparent that the orders of this Government referred to offensive operations only. For the opening direction of that Resolution runs as follows: “the reply to Major Way’s question as to permitting Muscat Government to send an expedition against Soar by sea must be in the negative;” and the Resolution thus concludes: “it is our object to preserve a neutral position between the combatants and to prevent all warlike operations by sea. We should abandon our neutral position if the Muscat Government were permitted to undertake not defensive but offensive opevations as proposed. 5. With these preliminary observations I am now directed briefly to review the various orders which have been passed regarding the maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gulf of Oman. Phis appears to be necessaiy in oidei clearly to show the position of this Government and the grounds upon which the instructions now under consideration were issued. 6. In his letter No. 115, dated 21st November 1868, Colonel Felly reported that there was an intention on the part of Syed Salim to collect some of the tribes from the Arab Coast to recover Muscat, as he considered the tribes to the southward still loyal to his cause. Colonel Felly had thus instructed Captain Way: —“ Syed Salim is desirous of embarking some men from the A.rab Coast on board of his Men-of-war. I am telegraming to Government on the subject. In the meantime I do not think that I am authorized in preventing him so long as no breach ot the peace at sea occurs in the Persian Gulf. Syed Salim would use his men solely on the Coast of Oman for the recovery of his lost dominions.” Subse quently Colonel Felly informed this Government {vide his No. 118 of 3rd December 1868) that Syed Salim’s Minister had limited his proposal to the employment of some men of the Henavee tribe from the Aboothabee Coast, and that accordingly he had agreed not to interfere with them, provided no breach of the maritime' truce should occur, and the ships on board of which the sailors might be embarked should not be employed otherwise than in His Highness’s Muscat dominions. 7. Such was the state of circumstances in the Gulf of Oman when Sir J. Lawrence issued the following order on the 9th of January 1869: “Naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented by force of Arms if necessary.” Under this order of the Government of India, no armaments by sea were allowed either in the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman, and the prohibition was held to extend to Gwadur and the coast of Mekran. The order was general both as to parties and places, and no exception was made to the enforcement of the rule by force or, in the language of the Government of India, by an act of war if necessary. At the same time the clearly understood policy of the British Government, as shown from the com mencement to the end of the official papers on Muscat affairs, was one of complete and scrupulous neutrality. So long as the peace at sea was notviolated, and British subjects were unmolested, no interference with any Military operations by land was to take place. 8. Early in May of the same year Syud Azan, who was in possession of Muscat, desired to reinforce his forts at Birkah by sending thither some troops and ammunition by sea. It appeared to Lieutenant-Colonel Disbrowe, then our Agent at Muscat, that the prohibition of the Government of India extended to the transport by sea even of necessary reliefs and supplies for the various garrisons on the Coast, and on Syud Azan proceeding to despatch troops notwith standing his protest, Colonel Disbrowe suspended diplomatic relations and retired on board a sloop of war in the harbour of Muscat. Reference was made to this Government for instructions, and it appeared to His Excellency in Council that this was an erroneous construction of the order which appeared to be directed against warlike operations by sea, or operations in furtherance of actual or imminent hostilities. But before this view could be communicated to Colonel Disbrowe, it appeared that a similar view had been taken by Colonel Pelly who was at that time at Muscat, and the transport of the reinforcements was permitted by that Officer, as reported in his despatch of 27th May 1869. Subsequently the Government of India, in their Despatch dated 4th August 1869, expressed their concurrence “ in the interpretation” put by Colonel Pelly on the original orders of the Government of Sir J. Lawrence of 9th January 1869. 9. With reference to this interpretation of Sir J. Lawrence’s order, Colonel Disbrowe shortly afterwards informed Syud Salim {vide letter of 10th August 1869,) that Colonel Pelly had given Syud Azan permission to transport ammu nition, stores, &amp;c., along the Oman Coast that lies between Sohar on the nortli and Ras-el-Hadd on the'south. Whereon this Government passed the following Resolution,dated 11th November 1869:— Vide Abstract of Proceedings of the Govern- u Colonel Disbrowe’s letter to His ment of Bombay in the Political Department for JJJ 2 .| mess S vu d Salim docs not seem acCU- Sovember 1869. Entry No. 141, page 42. J , ,, rately to represent the permission given by Colonel Pelly and concurred in by Government, which was to transport by sea the ordinary supplies of ammunition and stores required by forts in his possession. Anv extraordinary supplies for a force in the field would properly be stopped.” This Resolution, which clearly indicated the interpretation placed by this 1 Government on the orders of Sir J. Lawrence, as modified by the subsequent ruling of the Government of India, was communicated to Colonel p e ll v an( l became the rule for the guidance of our Officers in the Gulf. The Government of India neither at the time nor since have expressed any dissent as to the correctness of this interpretation. 10. At a later date a reference was made to this Government by Colonel Pelly for instructions as to whether Syud Toorkee should be permitted to cross the Gulf into Muscat territory. Although it was clear that he could have but one object in landing on the Arab Coast, it did not appear to this Government that his crossing even with a hostile intent came under the term “naval operations,” and that to ^prevent his doing so would be an active interference in favor of Syud Azan and his Government, And accordingly Colonel Pelly was instructed thus by telegram: “ If Syud Toorkee attempts to cross to Soor or Bahrein with an aimed following you 'are at once to prevent him, but if he embarks alone with only his personal servants you are not to interfere. In pursuance of these in structions Syud Toorkee was permitted to cross the Gulf and joined the armed forces in his interest who had seized and occupied Soor. These orders having been reported to the Government of India the following reply was re ceived—“Unless maritime peace is broken and warlike operations are being carried on by sea, no interference should take place. Colonel Pelly should not prevent Toorkee going to Soor alone or with a few followers. Viceroy agrees in opinion expressed in your telegram.” H Having been joined by the most powerful tribes of the south, it was rumoured that Syud Toorkee intended to send an expedition by sea to attack Muttra. Such an expedition would necessarily have proceeded within Muscat5 November lltli 1869, to which I have adverted, their views of the action taken by this G-overnment in the present instance would have been materially modified. It will be apparent to the Government of India that that Resolution was suffi ciently explicit to have justified Major Way in preventing the transport of artillery under the circumstances noted without further reference to Govern ment, and that in reply to Colonel Felly’s request for instructions it would have been sufficient for Government to have referred him to that Resolution for his guidance. 16. With regard to the second point I am desired to convey the assurance of His Excellency in Council that he has no desire whatever to trench upon the authority secured to the Right Honorable the Governor General in Council by Acts 13 and 33 of Geo. III. The sole object of this Government has been to carry out without question or hesitation the policy of the Government of India. I n cases of emergency, and in cases in which the construction of the existing orders seemed too clear to admit of a reasonable doubt, His Excellency in (Council has from time to time given the necessary instructions to the Officers on the spot. This amount of discretion is conceded by the Government of India oven to Colonel Felly and other local Officers. But in cases where a doubt exists the Local Government would equally by rule, and for their own protection, feel themselves bound to refer to the Supreme Government. 17. In the case which has given rise to the present correspondence, His Excellency in Council has, from your despatch to the Secretary of State, learnt with regret that the orders given by him in January last are opposed to the policy of the Government of India, who intimate that they would have allowed to Syed Azan what they refused to Syed Toorkee. It appears to His Excel lency in Council that such a course would have been inconsistent with our declared neutrality and with the policy laid down by Sir J. Lawrence. Iq however, the local Government had had any reason to believe that the altered policy, stated in your despatch to the Secretary of State, had been adopted by the Government of India, it would have been their duty at once to have carried it out. All that they did was simply to interpret, and, as it still appears to His I'iXcellency in Council, reasonably to interpret, antecedent orders in execution of, not in reversal of, or even in addition to, the instructions laid down by Sir J. Lawrence. And though undoubtedly obedience was enforced by an act of war, such an act of war was expressly directed by the instruction that all naval operations should be prevented by force if necessary. 18. That this interpretation was given without antecedent reference to the Government of India was caused by what appeared to be the urgency^ of the case, though His Excellency in Council is bound to add that the construction seemed to him so clear that even if there had been no necessity for an early reply to Colonel Felly he would have hesitated to think, after the Resolution of this Government of November 11th 1869, that a reference was necessary. 19. In conclusion I am directed to request that the Right Honorable the Viceroy in Council may be pleased to take an early opportunity of forwarding a copy of this communication to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State. His Excellency in Council would naturally have preferred that the Government^ of India should have allowed him an opportunity of explanation before imputing to his Government insubordination and illegality. But in any case it is desired that this statement should reach England before any opinion in the matter is expressed by the Home Authorities. I have the honor to be, Bombay Castle, } Sir, May 1871. ) Your most obedient servant, Acting Secretary to Governmeat.yf Minute by His Excellency the Governor, concurred in by the Honorable B. H.

The influence of the Arab leaders of the Wahabees was partly founded on their aggressive and martial spirit, and partly on the religious fanaticism which was excited by the preaching of the Wahabee reformers. About forty-five years ago the temporal power of the Wahabees received several severe checks. Ibrahim Pacha attacked them by land, occupied their capital, and for a time almost destroyed their political influence in Northern and Western Arabia. An expedition fitted out from Bombay, attacked some of the piratical ports on the Arabian Coast where Wahabee influence was most powerful; inflicted a considerable amount of chastisement on the most troublesome tribes, and these measures having been followed up by an increase of efficiency to the Bombay Marine, afterwards the Indian Navy, Arab piracy w r as for some years rarely heard of till lately. About the same time that Ibrahim Pacha was pressing the Wahabees by land, and the British Cruizers curbing their pirate disciples by sea, the late Imaum of Muscat, a wise and active Prince, opposed them in Oman, and prevented any extension of their temporal power in that direction. So completely was the temporal power of the Wahabees checked that they had been almost forgotten in the Indian political world, save as a dangerous sect of religious fanatics whose Indian disciples, at various times and at far distant points, have frequently caused anxiety to the British rulers of India during the past 30 years. There can be no doubt that the Wahabees have of late shown a considerable revival of their former activity, both as an aggressive temporal power in the interior of Arabia, and as leaders of fanatical revival in India. There seems much ground for believing that the great increase, which has taken place during the last ten years, in the slave trade between East Afnca and Arabia, is due to a new direction having been given to the naval enterprise of the tribes on the sea coast which were formerly most imbued with Wahabee fanaticism and most active in piracy. I2 The visits of Mr. Palgrave and Colonel Pelly to the Wahabee capital have thrown great light upon the resources of this power, and the information record ed by these travellers shows very clearly that the Wahabees have of late years been recovering from the effects of the chastisement formerly inflicted on them, and that they are likely to become exceedingly troublesome to all in contact with them, who will not submit to their religious domination. Apart from any internal impulse given by a revived spirit of religious fanaticism there are several obvious causes of the late development of Wahabee aggressive power in Arabia. Much is of course due to the natural effects of so many years of comparative rest in repairing their exhausted resources; something also no doubt to the dis appearance of the generation which had experienced the power of the Egyptian Pacha, the late Imaum of Muscat, and of British Naval and Military expeditionary forces. More however is probably owing to the sensible decay of vigour in the ruler of Muscat, and to the comparative rarity of any visit from our vessels of war to the old pirate coast of the Persian Gulf. But whatever the cause, there can be no doubt of the evil effects of this revival % of Wahabee power, and it is clear that these effects cannot be confined to the Continent of Arabia. We have had more than one warning sympton during the past year or two of a possible revival of piracy on our own Indian Coasts. There is every year increased activity in the slave trade carried on between East Africa and Arabia, chiefly by vessels belonging to the Wahabee pirate ports, and the aggressions of the Wahabees by land on the territories of the Imaum of Muscat, threaten seriously to injure a power which for several generations past has been the onlv representative of civilization and order in Eastern Arabia. I do not think that this is a state of things in which the British Government in India should be entirely passive. Our interest in the matter is not precisely the same as in 1821, when the pirates from the Wahabee coast threatened serious injury to the general trade of Bombay; but we have Treaty ties with the Imaum of Muscat, and there can be no doubt that any considerable increase of Wahabee influence would lead to, at least, an attempt to revive piracy, and seriously impede the rapidly increasing commerce of the Persian Gulf. It might also at any time interfere with our Telegraphic communication with Europe. The important question remains what it behoves the British Government to do under these circumstances? It seems quite clear that there is little chance of the Ameer paying the slightest attention either to such friendly advice as Colonel Pelly gave him, or to the temperate remonstrances of Colonel Disbrowe. I would not for the present advise any renewal of an attempt on the part ot our Political Agents to open a diplomatic correspondence with the Ameer of the Wahabees. He is from his ignorance of our power not likely to pay the slightest attention to our wishes or remonstrances, and for the present any attempt to open further communication with him is only likely to embroil us further. I would instruct Colonel Disbrowe to adopt a somewhat different tone to His Highness the Imaum of Muscat; to point out to His Highness clearly, but in temperate and friendly language, that the aggressions of the Wahabees are not likely to be checked by tame acquiescence, or by a constantly increasing additionof the tribute His Highness pays to them, that the Government of India will learn with regret, and surprize that its subjects have been murdered and plundered in a large town under His Highness’ flag without any effectual attempt on His Highness’ part to punish his own rebellious subjects, or to expel hostile invaders. I would point out to His Highness that the occasion is one which imperatively calls upon him to imitate the example of his illustrious father, to set his finances in order, to conciliate and revive the spirit of his feudatory tribes, to re-organize his military and naval forces, and to repel by force, if negotiation fail, the insolent aggressions of his Wahabee neighbours. I would not by any means lead him to lean on our aid in accomplishing these objects, but I would assure him of our intention scrupulously to fulfil our Treaty obligations, and of our desire to give him every reasonable support, not only moral but material, in any well-directed efforts he may make to re-establish his authority. There can be no doubt that His Highness’ power, if properly exerted, is ample to effect all that is required. I would aid him with munitions, and, if absolutely necessary, with assistance in money, and with the presence of such ships of Her Majesty’s naval forces in these Seas as the Commander-in-Chief may think best calculated to be of use in aiding the Imaum to re-establish His Highness’ authority in Soor or any other place on the seaboard, of which his rebellious subjects or the Wahabee enemy may have deprived him. Colonel Felly may be expected to return from his leave by the in-coming Mail, and I would propose to send him to Muscat, in the first instance, before he proceeds to Bushire, with such instructions as the Governor General may approve. With this view these proceedings should be at once reported to the Governoi General, and early instructions should be solicited. Copies should be sent to the Secretary of State. (Signed) H. B. E.

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters, noted in the margin,* relative to our * No. 27, dated the 14th February. intervention in the No. 31 , dated the 27th February. quarrel between the State of Muscat and the Wahabee Power in Nejed. 2 The first of these letters, received on the 22nd ultimo, informed the Government of India that Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis Felly, whose mission to Muscat “ to enquire and report fully on the actual state of affairs between tlie Wahabees and their neighbours on the coast” was sanctioned by my letter No. 1031, dated 6th December last, had despatched an ultimatum to the Wahabee Ameei, and that he intended, in case his demands were not acceded to within 17 days r -to destroy the Wahabee Forts on the Coast about the 29th January. The Govern ment of India, thus unexpectedly finding itself committed to a rupture with the Wahabees, was anxious to ascertain what authority Lieutenant-Colonel I elly had for his proceedings, and a telegram was therefore at once despatched to the Bombay Government, asking for a copy of the instructions under which that Officer was acting. The only other points in the letter under reply, which now require notice, are the report of the death of the Ameer Fysul and Lieutenant-Golone Felly’s interpretation of our Treaty relations with the Sultan of Muscat I he first is a matter of much political interest. On the second point I am to observe that our liability to afford the Sultan active aid in his quarrels has been already more than once discussed, and always decided in the negative. This Wl[[ apparent on reference to paragraph 7 of letter from this Office, No. , dated 1st February 1834, and to the documents therein quoted. 3 Your letters Nos. 31 and 33 forward copies of the despatches, received respectively from Lieutenant-Colonel Felly and Commodore Hillyar, detailing the operations which, under the former Officer’s instructions, were carried on by II M.’s S. “ Highflyer” up to the 13th February. It appears that tiie time allowed bv Lieutenant-Colonel Felly expired without the receipt of any reply from the* Wahabee Ameer, and that consequently on the 2nd lebruarv Captain Fasley having with him a native, named Hajee \acoob, as his political adviser, commenced hostilities by destroying two war Buglahs and a fort in Katif harbour. On the following day the “ Highflyer s boats disembai ked an attacking party against the fort of Demaum, but, in consequence of the strength of 'the fort audits garrison having been much under-rated, tins attack °epulsed with the loss of four men killed and two officers and three men o wounded^Yaptahi 'pasley then returned to Muscat, and Reported the result to% Lieutenant-Colonel Felly. The latter Officer at once proceeded to Soor in the “ Berenice,” and was followed thither on the 11th February by the “ Highflyer.” Next day the u Highflyer's” boats went up the Soor creek and destroyed or confiscated every Sooree craft, burning also a large quantity of ship timber. This terminated the operations. 4. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council fully concurs with the Government of Bombay in its recognition of the gallantry and good conduct displayed by the officers and men of H. M.’s S. “ Highflyer.” 5. But on the question whether Lieutenant-Colonel Felly was right in not accompanying the “ Highflyer” in her operations at Katif and Demaum, His Excellency in Council agrees rather with Commodore Hillyar, and thinks that if circumstances would not at the time admit of Lieutenant-Colonel Felly’s leaving Muscat, the attack on Demaum should have been deferred. The services of an Arab of the Coast, however intelligent and trustworthy, could not compensate for the Political Resident’s absence; and under these circumstances Captain Pasley and his officers must have been acting under great disadvantages. The rule that a Competent British officer, well acquainted with the coast, shall accompany every naval expedition despatched for active service on the Coast of Arabia, is one, which, in the opinion of the Government of India, should be carefully observed.*and since the abolition of the Indian Navy, it has become of more importance than ever that the best advice and information available should be at the disposal of Naval Officers on such occasions. 6. Referring to other points in Lieutenant-Colonel Felly’s proceedings the Government of India considers that he did not allow a sufficient time for a reply to be received from Riad, before ordering hostilities against Katif, and that the period granted for the satisfaction of his demand before bombarding Soor was still more inadequate; also that the terms he required were in both instances more than the circumstances of the case at each place required. 7. I am to take this opportunity of calling the attention of the Bombay Go vernment to my telegram of the 23rd ultimo. The Governor General in Council is anxious to be furnished, as soon as possible* with a copy of the instructions up on which Lieutenant-Colonel Felly considered himself justified in pushing affairs with the Wahabees to a point of active hostility. 8. The Governor General in Council approves of the view held by the Bombay Government that we should not at once renew the attack on Demaum, but wait and see what has been the effect of the chastisement which the tribes on the coast have already received. Should it be found necessary to renew the attack, and should the season admit of such a step, the gunboats and other material of vrar at Bombay can be used at the discretion of the local Government and Com modore Hillyar. 9. \ our letter No. 34, reporting that Lieutenant-Colonel Felly has received two inconclusive letters from the Wahabee Ameer, appears to call for no orders.

Sir, With reference to previous correspondence ending with my letter. No. 573 of the 27th February last, I am directed to forward to you the enclosed copy of a letter from the Government of India No. 266, dated the 14th instant, communicating the views of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the subject of our recent intervention in the quarrel between the State of Muscat and the Wahabee Power. 2. In forwarding this communication I am desired to state that you will probably wish to consult the Government Records of 1833-34, referred to by the Government of India, before adding any thing to your report of the 14th instant. (No. 17) just received. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) C. GONNE, Secretary to Government. No. 19 of 1866. Political Department. From, Lieutenant-Colonel L. Pelly, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. C. Gonne, Esquire, Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, I have the honor to acknowledge your letter as per margin,* enclosing * No. 820, dated 24th March 18G6. 2. I bow respectfully to the censure passed on me by His Excellency the Governor General in Council although had an opportunity for explanation been afforded me, I should not have despaired of modifying some of the views expressed by His Excellency, and even now that judgment has been passed, I beg leave,with the permission of Government, to submit a few remarks which seem necessary to a full statement of facts, and to the justification of my official character— hitherto unimpugned during a term of twenty-six years. 3. The Government of India imply that my mission to Muscat was one of enquiry and report, which I unexpectedly converted into a rupture with the W ahabees. 4. It is true that in one of their letters, the Government of Bombay directed me to enquire and report fully concerning the Wahabee and Muscat differences, but it is no less true that the Government of India in a previous letter dated the 8th of November 18G5, No. 940, had transmitted to me a telegram from Sir Charles Wood, requesting the Senior Naval Officer to proceed to the Coast of Arabia, and to take, in concert with me, such measures instrumental as we might think likely to promote an arrangement, providing, however, that nothing was to be undertaken on land. 5. In transmitting the above documents the Government of Bombay ex- ^ ^ pressed a hope that on the arrival of a vessel JSo. 2891, dated 24th November I 8 G 0 .. of |^ r Ma j esty ' s Navy 01lthe Arabian Coast I should be in a better position to judge what was desirable to be done. 6. In a subsequent letter Government pointed out to me the murder and/ No. 3110 of 21 st December 1805. P lu,uler the Ind f subjects by the Waha- bees, and reminded me that the Wahabee Ameer had failed of proposing any reparation for the injury done to our subjects, or in regard to compensation for the subject, who had been killed. 7. On the arrival of H. M’s. S. S. “ Highflyer” in the Gulf, I found that her sailing orders tallied with mine, permitting the Officer in command to use force on my requisition, and limiting him only in regard to operations on land. I ventured to think that the foregoing instructions contemplated not only enquiry and report, but action. I submitted a series of reports* accordingly, and meditated such proceedings as might, under the given instructions, be best adapt ed to save our ally the Sultan of Muscat which then imminently threatened his territories under 8 . * No. 50, dated the 24th November 1865. No. 55, dated the 21 st December 1865. No. 3, dated the 16th January 1866. No. 7, dated the 12 th February 1866. from the annihilation Wahabee invasion. 9. The Government of India remark in their second paragraph on my interpretation of our Treaty relations with Muscat, and remind me that our lia bility to aid the Sultan had been decided in the negative under a letter dated 1st February 1834. 10. I respectfully submit that, I believe, I was myself the first to point out . Tr .. , „ ^ to the Government of India* the existence of ber im m! ‘ a document dated in December 1825, and which negatived our liability to aid the Sultan by land, and in previous and subsequent reports I have endeavoured, to the best of my ability, to explain to Government the aspects which our relations with Muscat wore, not to me, but to all tribes and parties concerned. 11. But whatever might be the qualifications given in correspondence in the year 1825 or 1834 to our Treaty obligations with Muscat, I went on what I be lieved to be my instructions, and in any case the book of Treaties published under authority of the Government of India, during the past year, contains a printed copy of our Treaty with Muscat, and the second Article of this Treaty runs to the following effect:— “ From the recital of the said Nawab, my heart has become disposed to an increase of the friendship with that State, and from this day io t * forth, the friend of that Sirkar is the friend of this, and the friend of this Sirkar is to be the friend of that; and in like manner, the enemy of that Sirkar is the enemy of this and the enemy of this is to be the enemy of that.” And I deferentially submit that to have postponed the provisions of this authorized publication of I 860 , in favor of certain unpublished correspondence closing thirty years ago, might have brought down on me censure not less strong than that now passed on me. 12 . Paragraphs 3 and 5 of the letter from the Government of India sum marize the naval operations on the Coast of Arabia, and animadvert on my alleged deviation from rule in not accompanying “ Highflyer.” 13. I beg to submit that when about ten years ago our vessels of war blockaded these same Wahabee ports and destroyed the inner Demaum fort, the Resident remained at Bushire and Government approved his proceedings. Secondly, that when during a series of years the Resident had occasion habitually to send vessels of war to check or punish the Arabs of the littoral, it was never the practice for him to proceed on board. He made one complimentary tour of in spection per annum and this was all. Thirdly, in the present instance my special mission was to Muscat, and subsequent events must I think have fully satisfied Government that the .urgent entreaties of the Muscat authorities for me to remain on their coast, were not without cause. Fourthly, Government will bear in mind that when “ Highflyer” first met me, and requested me to state in writing what were my views in regard to the Muscat and Wahabee disturbances^ I replied as follows:— U I understand that Her Majesty’s Government will not do any thing by land to aid the Sultan of Muscat, but that they are prepared to aid him on the sea-board with the presence of a ship of war.” u The only points where the Wahabees can be touched from seaward are their ports of Ojair and Katif, and so far as my unprofessional eye can see, the only method by which a ship of war can aid the Sultan in his present crisis, is by blockading the Wahabee Ports, until the Wahabee Government comes to terms. Complicated with the Wahabee invasion is the butchery of one British Indian subject, and the plunder of ten or more others, at the Port of Soor on the Muscat Coast, by the Wahabee troops. If you blockade, the arrangement of this matter might be included in the general settlement; if you do not blockade, it would be for you to give to the matter such consideration as you may deem fit, and may be enabled to, under the orders you have received from the Commodore. It will probably be obvious to you that it could not be advisable for the English Government to commence any active operations which it might not be convenient to carry to a conclusion. To act otherwise would be to confirm the impres sion already too prevalent of our own absence of naval power and would leave our ally the Sultan more than ever liable to Wahabee aggression.” The officer in command rejoined that “ Highflyer’s” time in the Persian Gulf was limited; that he had no reason to suppose \ule Captain Easleys letter of 6 th an y vessel of war was coming up to take my letter No. 3 of 16th January 1866. her place, that he could not lecommend the 0 establishment of a blockade which could not be enforced after “ Highflyer’s” departure, but that in regard to the insults inflicted on our subjects, he would be happy to assist me either by confiscating the shipping at Katif, or by destroying the Wahabee Ports. I possessed no authority whatsoever over Her Majesty’s Naval Officers, and I bad simply to elect between two courses, either to request the “ Highflyer” to return to Bombay or to acquiesce in such hurried operations as Naval authority considered it could carry out, under the orders of the Commodore. To have returned “ Highflyer” to Bombay w r ould have laid me open to a just rebuke for having failed to accept such Naval instruments as were available for supporting Muscat, and vindicating the murder and plunder of our subjects. In accepting the “ Highflyer’s” services, I could not, of course, anticipate that she would fail. To have postponed hermovements would not have induced her to accept my method of procedure, but would, on the contrary, have simply retained her idle in the Gulf, during the time allowed her by the Commodore. And there would have been no chance of her return, for Government are, I believe, aware that the ships of Her Majesty’s Naval Service, are not permitted to remain in the Persian Gulf during the hot season, which extends from April to November. The best evidence that my letter to the Ameer was not ill suited to the object in view, lies in the fact that while the Wahabee Ameer had remained deaf to all former British communications he now speedily offered to accept my mediation as between him and Muscat, and to endeavour to recover the plundered property, following his offers by the despatch of a negociator. 14. The 6th paragraph of the letter of the Government of India alleges that I did not allow the Ameer sufficient time for his reply. Captain Pasley°on the other hand alleges that the Damaum Fort was reinforced owing to the delay caused by my letter. But I would respectfully remind Government, that I had during a period of two years been striving my utmost to restore our relations with the Wahabee Power, rudely shaken before my arrival in the Gulf. That in so far as my own Political charge was concerned, I had succeeded in restoring these relations, by seeking, at the hazard of my life, an interview with the Ameer in his capital. That in so far as my own duties were concerned, all was peace with the Wahabees. But Government considering that J should postpone my local interests to those of the general good, deputed me to a separate jurisdiction; that ot Muscat to uphold her in a quarrel with the Wahabees. That in further ance of this policy I had addressed polite letters to the Ameer for the adjustment of differences. That Government had eventually forbidden any further friendly communication with the Wahabee Ameer. And that my letter now condemned by the Government of India was necessarily in the form of a categorical demand affording indeed ti ne for a reply, but taking care also that no unnecessary delav should take place, lest Her Majesty’s ship of war should sail away in obedience of orders from the Commodore and leave my letter an idle threat. 15. As regards the notice given at Soor, I would submit that it was quite feasible for the Soorees to have met the demand at once, and the best proof of this is, that when they found I had acted and might act again, they came to Muscat with the balance due. Soor is distant from Muscat only 90 miles. In any case my demand on the Soorees was delivered to them on the 17th of January 1866. My attack on them was made after a period of about four weeks on the 11th of February, and during the interval they were repeatedly warned bv the Muscat authorities to give satisfaction. 16. As regards my general policy, it is difficult to allude to it without seeming egotism. But Government are well aware that prior to my arrival in the Gulf the fines and punishment of the Arabs had been habitual; that after my arrival I held the Gulf for three years without any naval aid, and without once lining or punishing any man whatsoever. Having passed single handed through more warlike and fanatical tribes than any European now living, it is to be sup posed that I cannot but have studied their several characters; and that if I have deviated irom my habitual policy of gaining my ends by gentleness, and by that personal power which an English Gentleman can generally exert among bar barians, I have so deviated not from any personal feeling but because I had in structions so to do, while instruments for so doing were punished by Government. Arab tribes are not to be judged of by the mild inhabitants of British India, and il you are compelled to threaten them you cannot threaten in vain without loss ot reputation and subsequent ill effects. ^ remark that Commodore Ilillyar has expressed an opinion as to where t ie Evident m the Persian Gulf should be, and for what he is responsible. I v\ou( submit that no Officer just arrived from England, however able or ex perienced, can be expected to know my duty better than myself, and as I should hesitate to suggest to the Commodore at what part of his station the Flao- ship s iou d be, so would I claim for a Political Officer standing alone, during a crisis,and watching two thousand miles of coast line, permission to take his own points of observation. I venture respectfully to submit that so long as I am your repre sentative in the Gulf, I am the best judge, responsible always to the.Governments at Bombay and Calcutta, and to Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, and Her Majesty’s Secretaries of State for India and Foreign Affairs as to where I ought to be and what I ought to do. 18. The concluding paragraph of the letter from the Government of India describes the letters received from the AVahabee Ameer as inconclusive. As these letters relate to a mediation in which the Governments of India, Muscat and Nejed are concerned, it seems unavoidable that a letter offering to accept mediation by one party should be inconclusive until the offer should be accepted by the two other parties.

Sir, In reply to your letter No. 266, dated the 14th March last, I am directed to forward, for submission to His Excellency the Governor General in Council, the enclosed copy of a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis Pelly, in explanation of his proceedings and general policy in connection with the recent quarrel between the Muscat State and the AA r ahabee Power. 2. The Honorable the Governor in Council trusts that this explanation will be quite satisfactory to the Government of India, and enable His Excellency the A iceroy in Council to relieve Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly of whatever censure may be implied in the communication to which it refers. 3. There can, the Honorable the Governor in Council thinks, be no doubt that in acting as he did, Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly simply carried out the same policy which our Government has followed for many years past on the North East Coast of Arabia, that the measures he adopted were warranted by his instructions and by the traditions of his office, and that but for the murder of the Sultan of Muscat, a crime which could not possibly have been foreseen, and against which he could not guard, the result would, on the whole, in all human probability, have been highly successful notwithstanding the unfortunate failure of the u Highflyer’s” boats to capture Demaum. For this failure the Governor in Council cannot hold Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly answerable, as it appears to have been mainly attributable to the incautious daring of the gallant officers employed. 4. Referring to the 7th paragraph of your letter under reply, I am desired to state that the Telegram alluded to was duly received and was considered to8 iave been disposed of intermediately, as the Government of India had been put hnto possession of all communications that had been received from, and all that had been addressed to, Colonel Felly, on the subject in question. 5. I am desired to add that one of Colonel Felly’s reports to which he * No. 55 of the 21st December 1865. f cfel ' S &gt;“ . h js l^ter* now forwarded has not been received by this Government, and he has accordingly been requested to furnish a duplicate of it by an early opportunity.

Yesterday I received your telegram, conveying the instructions of the Government of India to the effect, that I might come to an arrangement with the Wahabee representative, provided that any payment from the Muscat Government shall be as arranged between that Government and the Wahabee, and not guaranteed by the British Government. Secondly, that I might give my good offices in arranging the details of an Agreement between the two parties, subject to the above condition, and thirdly, enjoining that no Treaty between the British Government and the Wahabee Chief should be made without its full details being submitted to the India Government, and sanctioned by the Home Government. 3. Accordingly, this morning, I had another interview with the Wahabee Envoys, who acceded in all respects to the wishes of Her Majesty’s Government. 4. The Envoys state that if any difficulties should arise as to the tribute payment from Muscat, the Ameer will solicit my good offices. 5. I append copy of a letter I have addressed to the Wahabee Ameer. 6. Government may rest perfectly assured that no measures, much less one of the importance of a Treaty, will be entered on by me unless under full and explicit instructions from those authorities to whom I am responsible. 7. I asked the Wahabee Envoys what the Ameer meant by stating in his letters that Agreements had existed of old between his Government and the British? The Envoys replied that the Wahabee Ameers had, from time to time, received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabee Govern ment consider a friendly letter to be synonymous with a Treaty Agreement. 8. Before leaving, the Wahabee Envoys explained to me that the present Wahabee Ameer had many enemies and difficulties to contend with, and trusted that I would not credit reports that might be made to his prejudice. I replieu, that I was well aware of the critical position of the Wahabee Government, and knew that it had powerful enemies, as well at home as on its frontier. And these difficulties appeared to me as supplying additional reasons for the Wahabee2 * Government remaining peaceably within its own territories, and consolidating itself. For the rest, if the Wahabee Ameer desired any further communication, he could forward it in writing, when it would be duly transmitted by me tohighei authority.

The religion of the Wahabees lies between themselves, their Imaum, and their God, and the English Government have no wish to interfere therein. 5. I hope this may find you in health.

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters No. 112, dated the 21st ultimo, and No. 124, dated the 31st idem, reporting the progress of the negotiations between the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Wahabee Envoy. 2. In reply, I am desired to intimate that the conciliatory spirit shown by the Wahabee Envoy, is satisfactory. The Governor General in Council hopes that it will enable Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly to bring the differences between the Wa habee Ruler and the State of Muscat to a satisfactory conclusion. 3. With regard to our owm causes of complaint against the Wahabees, His Excellency in Council authorizes the Resident, after hearing all that can be said, both on behalf of the British subjects injured at Soor, and also by the Wahabees in justification of their proceedings, to use his own discretion in coming to terms with the Envoy as to the amount of compensation that may be reasonably demanded. 4. But in both cases the Government of India entirelv concurs with the •/ Government of Bombay in discountenancing Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly’s sugges tion that the interference of the Turkish Government should be invoked. No good, but much harm, would result from the question of Turkish supremacy over the Wahabee territory being imported into our relations with the latter power. It has alw r ays been our policy (See* letter from Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul General at Baghdad, to our Ambassador at Constantinople, dated the 1st January 1862) to repudiate the Porte’s claim to authority in that quarter, and the Governor General in Council is satisfied that any deviation from the principle will give rise to complications much to be deprecated.

MUIR, Secretary to the Government of India. ; W Extract from a letter from Her Britannic Majesty's Consul General at Baghdad, to Her Britannic Majesty 1 s Ambassador at Constantinople, dated Is/ January 1862. Although it may not be denied that, since the Egyptian invasion of Nedj in 1839-40, Ameer Feysul has remained tributary to the Turkish autho-rities of Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion, it is certain that the Porte has never exercised any jurisdiction, or attempted to extend its authority, over that country. Were it otherwise, were a Turkish administration established, capable of controlling the province, of res training the Wahabees and their dependants from the piratical practices for which they were once so notorious, and finally, of preventing or giving satisfaction for any breach of international law, such a state of things might be as conducive to good order, as it would be certainly less burdensome to the British Govern ment than the Maritime surveillance, which, in the interests of commerce, the Bri tish Government is now compelled to maintain in the Persian Gulf. But in point of fact, the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tributary: not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country; and to judge from my own experince of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that were the relations of that Officer with the Ameer of Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabee Coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty’s Indian Government in that quarter.

Sib, I have the honor to acknowledge the Government letter, No. 3573 of the 24th ultimo, requiring information as to what extent Bahrein is held to be actually subordinate to the Wahabee Rulers, either in respect of tribute or otherwise. 2. The islands of Bahrein are, I believe, held by the Sheikhs of Bahrein to be independent. ^ &gt; 3. The islands of Bahrein are held by English authorities to be inde pendent, and this view of the case has, for at least the past twenty years, been maintained by us. In exemplification of this view, I would refer to correspond ence now marginally noted,* where u with reference to the designs of Tur key to establish a* supremacy over Bah rein” Government laid down “that it is obviously desirable to exclude, as much as possible, all interference by Foreign Powers in the affairs of the Persian Gulf, since it is only by retaining the supreme authority in its own hands, that the British Government can hope to secure the permanence of the objects it has gained in that quarter at such a large expense,” and where the Honorable the Board of Directors ruled u that anv attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the Naval I orce in the Gulf,’ and “ authorized Government to instructf the Resident accordingly.” On a subsequent occasion it was laid down by the Government of India “ that Her Majesty’s Government would not admit of the occupation of Bahrein by the ino. ivy oi iutn iviay iooo. Turkish Government or by any one acting for it or in its interest, and consequently that the Government ol India should offer every obstacle to an attack upon that island by the Wahabee Chief. Again Sir Charles Wood, in his letter £ now T noted, and copy of which has already been .submitted, decided that Bahrein should be regarded as independent, and as subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia. 4. Since writing the foregoing an Envoy from the Bahrein Chief has called on me, acknowledging and apologizing for past misconduct, and giving solemn assurances that, tor the future, neither the English Government nor its subjects shall have any cause of complaint. The Envoy states that the Sheikh of Bahrein holds himself absolutely independent of the Wahabee Ruler in* so far as the islands of Bahrein are concerned; but that the Chief having occupied * Letter from Major S.

There is little doubt in my own mind that the intelligence brought through Nedjd of the massacre of the European Consuls and Christians at Jedda also had some influence on the viciously disposed temper of Sheikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa in the present case, which is only one of many* instances in which he has shewn his disregard of the favors * Parted rasian Gulf Records, an( j ass istance which he has at all times derived bee Tribe. • from the British Government. Indeed, with a person of so vacillating and hasty a temper as Mahomed ben Khuleefa, it is always most difficult to co-operate for mutual good, prove, as he is, to be impulsive and arbitrary on the least occasion, even at the risk of breaking those ties which have secured to him tranquil possession of a territory which he is certainly unfitted to rule.

N., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Busbire. Dated 26th Jemadee-oos-Sanee 1277, 8th January 1861. Received 26th January 1861. A.C.—Not having heard from you for a considerable period, I write you this letter, my object being to remind you not to be unmindful of Bahrein.**,; Aik 2. Lately the Bahrein Chiefs deputed one Moraykhee to me, I, however, refused him an audience, for I know the Chiefs do not act up to their engage ments, nor is any dependence to be placed upon their word. Moreover you and I are in correspondence respecting their condition. 3. Intelligence has reached me that they purpose deputing to me Khuleefa, the son of the ruling Chief, with what object I cannot say. In short, be it known to you that, until I learn your sentiments in respect to the Chiefs, I will neither trust their word nor assent to conditions they may propose. 4. I deemed it necessary to depute my friend, Saood ben Abdul Rehman, to wait upon you with this letter, and to receive your reply because the Chiefs have uttered many falsehoods to me, have behaved very wrongfully towards me and others, and have striven all in their power by addressing communications to the authorities of Foreign Powers to withdraw themselves from my authority. 5. You have informed me that you will make an arrangement of my affairs with the Chiefs to be abided by all, and this is the reason I have not furnished replies to the Sheikh’s missives.

Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, Secret Department. In continuation of my despatch to your address under date the 3rd instant; I have the honor to report, for the information of the Honorable the Governor in Council, that I reached Bahrein on the 8th idem. 2. In the course of the afternoon of that day, Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, the Chief of this wealthy and populous island, came on board the Sloop to visit me. The enclosed copy of a letter to Major Rawlinson, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, dated the 9th instant, will make His Honor in Council aware of the subject which the Uttoobee Sheikh first introduced regarding the pretensions put forward by the Agents of the Ottoman Porte upon Bahrein, as a dependency of that Government. 3. After the discussion on the point above referred to, but evidently in con nexion with it, Sheikh Mahomed, the Chief of Bahrein, went on to appeal to me, whether he had not endeavoured to shape his conduct in every respect according to the views of the British Government, and whether his subjects had not consequently the same claim upon the favor and countenance of the authorities in India, as the dependents of His Highness the Imaum and other Powers. That great trouble and annoyance had been inflicted on his people by the authorities of the Bombay Custom House, on the arrival of their vessels at the Presidency during the season, for the purpose of trade, and an intimation given, that unless they placed themselves under the guardianship of some Foreign Power, and carried the Flag and Pass furnished by their Protector, double Harbour fees and double Custom duties, would be exacted from them for the future. At the same time, added the Sheikh, the inhabitants of Koweit, who had acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Porte, and all those Arabs who professed allegiance to the Imaum of Muscat, and produced the Registers and Flags supplied to them by their Governments, were treated with consideration, and charged only single Haroour dues and customs. It was quite true, as he bad before so explicitly assured me, he was most unwil ling to submit to any foreign yoke, but it appeared to be the wish of the authori ties in India to drive the Maritime Chiefs of the Gulf, to place themselves under the authority of either the Imaum of Muscat or the Sultan of Constantinople, in which case, be must, of course, be under the reluctant necessity of taking steps to obtain for his subjects the same privileges as those accorded to the people of Koweit, by following their example. 4. I replied, that I heard with much regret he should think he had grounds of complaint regarding the treatment experienced by his dependents at the bauds of the functionaries of the Bombay Custom House, but that I could not help surmising, some misunderstanding must have taken place, as I had never beard that any orders of the nature of those alluded to by the Sheikh had been issued by the authorities in India—that I believed certain native vessels bad evaded the payment of the customary charges^ by passing themselves off as the subjects of2 I ^ Mu .1. the linaum of Muscat, when, in fact, they were in no way connected with His Highness, and consequently an order had been issued that all Arab vessels, not carrying the Register and Flag of their respective Chiefs, would be liable to be called upon for double duties. I concluded by saying, that I was certain the Indian Government took too deep an interest in the maintenance of the indepen dence of the Arabian Maritime Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf, to sanction any mea sures which would be likely to compromise it, and it appeared to me all that was necessary to place his people on the same footing with those of Muscat and Turkey, w'ould be the issue of regular Registers and Passes to all the vessels belonging to them, certifying that these were bond fide the property of Bahrein subjects, and carried the Bahrein Flag. I would, however, I said, make a special reference on this subject, without delay, to the Bombay Government, and trusted that before long, it would be in my power to afford him a full and satisfactory reply. 5. In the absence of any correct information, it is quite out of my power to say, whether the Bahrein Chief has any just grounds or not, for the complaint preferred by him. I think it, however, my duty to state, that should the apprehen sions of Sheikh Mahomed of its being the intention of Govermnent to levy double Harbour fees and duties on Bahrein vessels be well founded, the result will be his acknowledgment of the supremacy of the Ottoman Porte, and acceptance of the Registers and Passes of that Government. I beg to add, that no customs are levied upon British produce imported by British subjects into Bahrein, and there fore the Ruler of that island has, I venture to think, a right to claim for his own people, the same privileges as those enjoyed by the most Javored nation. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., H. C. Sloop-of-war “Elphinstone,” | (Signed) S. HENNELL, At Sea, 10th May 1847. ) Resident in the Persian Gulf. Secret Department* Major S. Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf. Major Rawlinson, C. B., Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, Baghdad. I have the honor to acquaint you, that in the course of my interview yesterday with Sheikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa, the Chief of Bahrein, lie informed me that he had received a letter from the Pasha of Baghdad, to the effect, that the Sheikh of Koweit being a dependent of the Ottoman Porte, all his vessels carried the Turkish flag and a Turkish Pass, that as the Uttobee Tribe inhabiting Bahrein was closely connected with that of Koweit, Sheikh Mahomed would, of course, acknowledge his dependency on the Sultan, and forthwith furnish lists of his vessels, crews, &amp;c., &amp;c., in order that the requisite Registers might be pre pared and forwarded. The Sheikh went on to say, that beingaware I was on my tour of the Arabian Coast, and might be shortly expected at Bahrein, he had returned an evasive reply until he could consult me upon this unexpected de mand, and he now wished to have my opinion upon it. I replied that, as far as I was aware, the British Government had overlooked upon the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent Chief, and subject to no foreign Government—that, of course, he must be the best judge of his own interests, but considering that his ancestors had From, To, Sir,■m *•■*-** always governed the island in their own right, and without paying allegiance to any other power, I could hardly suppose that Sheikh Mahomed would be the first hf his race to place himself under the yoke of another. I concluded by remarking, that the British Government had proved its desire for the maintenance of the independence of the Maritime Chiefs of the Arabian Coast, by the Treaties and Engagements it had entered into with, and the general line of policy it had ever pursued towards them. The Sheikh answered, that so far as his own inclinations were concerned, he had not the slightest wisli to place himself in submission tv) any foreign State, and that while the British Government maintained the same friendly relations with him, which it had hitherto done, he should be perfectly satisfied, and entertain no apprehensions regarding the designs of any other power. 2. The above is the substance of what passed between Sheikh Mahomed and myself upon this subject, which, as affording some grounds for a rumour late ly current in the Persian Gulf, that it is the intention of the Ottoman Porte to extend its influence and authority over all the Maritime Tribes on the Arabian Coast, you may, perhaps, consider of sufficient importance to lay before Her Majesty's Minister at Constantinople. 3. I have reason to believe that the communication received by the Bahrien Chief was not, as stated by him, from His Highness Nejib Pasha, but either from the Mootesillem of Bussorau or the Turkish Officer lately despatched front Baghdad, with the new orders regarding the abolition of the traffic in African slaves. What degree of authority the one or the other may possess from the Turkish Government for advancing the claims on Bahrein referred to in the pre ceding paragraphs, you will, of course, be best able to ascertain. 4. Although the question is, in many respects, a novel one, still judging from the line of policy hitherto pursued by the British Government with regard to the Pasha of Egypt and the Court of Teheran, the prosecution of whose claims upon the island of Bahrein, it was even prepared to resist by force. I cannot for a moment imagine that a more favorable View will he taken by Her Majesty’s Ministers of the attempt now apparently making by the Ottoman Porte for the extension of its authority and influence over the independent tribes of the Ara bian Coast. 5. How far it may be expedient to agitate this subject, either in Baghdad or Constantinople, until some more overt steps be taken for the attainment of the objects supposed to be in contemplation, will be best judged of by yourself and Her Majesty’s Envoy at the Porte. With only their present Naval means and re sources it is quite out of the power of the Turkish functionaries in this quarter to inflict any injury on the Chief of Bahrein, while on the contrary he is strong enough to retaliate any attempt of the kind, with full effect. In the event however of the Ottoman Porte despatching, as talked of, a number of its vessels of war into this Gulf, the case would be altogether altered, and it would then be necessary for us to be prepared to take decided measures; if it continues to be, as it hitherto has always been, our policy to preserve a paramount British influence in the Persian Gulf, by supporting the Maritime Arabian Chiefs inhabiting its Coasts, in the maintenance of their independence.

I am directed by the Honorable the Governor in Council to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 10th May last, No. 171 A, reporting what passed at an interview which you had with the Chief of Bahrein on 8th idem. 2. There are two points in your letter requiring to be especially noticed ; 1st, the complaint of the Chief of Bahrein that double duties are levied in Bombay on boats belonging to his dependants; and 2ndly, the designs of the Turkish authorities to claim a supremacy over the Chief of Bahrein which has not hitherto been exercised by the Ottoman Government. 3. In regard to the first point, 1 am directed to transmit, for your informa tion, copy of the corres pondence noted in the margin,* which will ex-* plain the circumstances under which extra duty was levied, in the early part of the year, from cer tain Bahrein boats which were unprovided with Passes or Registers of any description whatever. You will, however, perceive from my letter of this date to the Collector of Customs, that Government has now authorized the refund to the owners of the extra duties levied on that occasion. 4. I am, however, directed to request that you will distinctly inform the Chief of Bahrein that, in future, vessels belonging to himself or his subjects will be liable to the extra duties levied on foreign vessels entering Bombay unless they are provided with Passes, as ordered in the 3rd paragraph of my letter, dated the 8th May last, No. 1856. You are also requested to adopt measures to secure that all vessels from the Gulf, hitherto allowed the same privileges as British vessels, be furnished with the prescribed Passes from their respective Chiefs. 5. With reference to the designs of Turkey to establish a supremacy over Bahrein, 1 am directed to inform you that it is obviously desirable to exclude, as much as possible, all interference, by foreign powers, in the affairs of the Persian Gulf, since it is only by retaining the supreme authority in its own hands that the British Government can hope to secure the permanence of the objects it has gained in that quarter at such a large expense. 6. As however this subject can only be properly dealt with by the Home authorities, it will be referred for their consideration by the next Mail; andmean while you are requested to act in conformity with the views of Govern ment above expressed in your intercourse with the Chiefs of the Gulf, taking care, however, at the same time, not to involve yourself in any discussion that can be avoided with the Turkish authorities.

Consequently the Government of India, His Lordship in Council is of opinion, should offer every obstacle to an attack upon that island by the Wahabee Chief. 4. I am desired to remark, however, that it does not appear that it is either expected of, or expedient for the Government of India to interfere in any way in the disputes between the Chief of Bahrein and his kinsmen, or actively to aid him in the measures necessary for the defence of his Coast possessions.

Sir, I have the honor to report, for the information of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, that, on the 24th instant, a boat arrived from Bahrein, having been specially despatched by Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, the Chief of tsafe from the risk of foreign aggression, but that no acts of oppression or injustice on the part of their local rulers would be tolerated for the future. Under such a change of circumstances I cannot doubt that Bahrein would speedily recover its former flourishing and prosperous condition. 6. I have now attempted to lay before the Right Honorable the Governor in Conncil both sides of the question. It will remain for the Government to decide, whether the loss of our influence likely to accrue in this quarter from the contingency of Bahrein becoming a dependency of either Persia or Turkey, is of sufficient importance to counterbalance the trouble and embarrassment which may arise from accepting the proposition of the Chief of that island, that he should henceforth be considered a subject of Great Britain. It is with diffidence and some hesitation I venture to add, that my own opinion inclines to the negative. 7.

Accordingly my request of you is, if you approve of what I have at heart, and am bent upon, that you will cause the return to me of those who have seceded from my territories, to the advantage of the country and its inhabitants—otherwise, if you account me dependent upon others, be pleased to acquaint me with whatever is conformable to the policy of the British Government.

But my friend, this is a matter of great importance, and one to which no subordinate authority, like myself, can give a full replv. All 1 can do is, without any delay, to forward your letter to the British Govern ment, and as soon as I have received its orders upon the proposition therein made, to communicate them to you. In respect to the seceders from Bahrein, I am fully aware how greatly it would be to the advantage of that place, they should return to their homes upon it. Accordingly I have written twice, acquainting them with your friendly senti ments, and recommending them not to expatriate themselves from their native land. In the course of the present spring it is my intention, Inshallah, to proceed to the Arabian Coast Should a favorable opportunity offer, I will communicate personally with Yoosoof ben Ibrahim, and Jassim ben Mahomed ben Sugger, and, as far as friendly advice can go, will endeavour to persuade them to meet your wishes for their return to Bahrein.

Sir, Since the outrages by people under the authority of the Sheikh of Bahrein were committed, and the perpetrators visited by penalties, as reported on in my despatch No. 284, and enclosures, I regret to state that Mahomed ben Khuleefa, the Ruler of that place, resorted to his old habits of exhibiting towards the Govern ment, its authorities and its subjects, an amount of disrespect and annoyance, which seemed to me to demand an immediate check. 2. The plans that wayward personage took for displaying his temper will best be seen from the correspond ence* now enclosed for the infor mation of the Right Honorable His Lordship in Council of Bom bay. The course adopted by myself on the occasion is also therein shewn, as well as the satisfactory manner of the termi nation of the Mission on which l despatched my Assistant Lieut Disbrowe to the island, supported by Commodore Jenkins, C.

There is little doubt in my own mind that the intelligence brought through Nedjd of the massacre of the European Consuls and Christians at Jedda also had some influence on the viciously disposed temper of Sheikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa in the present case, which is only one of manyt instances in which he has shewm his disregard of the favors f Printed Persian Gulf Records, an( j assistance which he has at all times derived Pages 42!, 423,425 on the ttoo- f rom t j ie Britigh Government. Indeed, with a DtJG in DCS 1 person of so vacillating and hasty a temper as Mahomed ben Khuleefa, it is always most difficult to co-operate for mutual good,prone, as he is, to be impulsive and arbitrary on the least occasion, even at the risk of breaking those ties which have secured to him tranquil possession ol a territory which he is certainly unfitted to rule.

From, To, TRANSLATED SUBSTANCE OF A LETTER Hajee Jassem, British Agent at Bahrein. Captain Felix Jones, I. N., # Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Dated 14th Mohurrum 1275, 24th August 1858. A. C.—The Bunnyans residing in Bahrein possess two Buglahs, either carrying the British Flag. When the Commodore was lately here they complained (to him) of an excessive amount of dues that were taken from them. Commodore Jenkins desired me to see that they were not oppressed. 2. In former days all exports were free from duty, customs being only charged upon imports; now, however, the Chief levies duty upon both exports and imports, his object being to allow the Bunnyans no choice but to pay duty on ex ports, inasmuch as they have bought a large quantity of green dates from the Sheikhs, on which they will have to disburse customs when they export them. 3. The Bunnyans possess also a vast stock of green dates at Kateef, and they launched their Buglahs intending to despatch them thither for the dates. The Bahrein Chief, however, sent word to them, that no one was permitted to repair to Kateef, neither Bunnyans nor natives of Bahrein. If any one possessed pro perty at Kateef, he should cause it to be brought to Bahrein, and having paid customs thereon, he might ship it. Now no one owns property in Kateef^ save Bunnyans. ! 4. When I saw this unjust behaviour of Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa towards the Bunnyans, I waited upon him and spoke to him on the subject. The Chief said, I have placed an embargo on the Bunnyans’ Boats, as also on your Buteel. I rejoined, do you desire to lower us (in estimation of others,) and do you purpose levying duties ? * The Sheikh replied, “ I will take dues from the Bunnyans, and will permit none of them to go to Kateef. I am at enmity * Religious tit e. w jtb Kateef. I know not how I stand with Ameer Fvsul, for he has not up to date deputed, as was his wont, a person to receive the ‘ Zikat.’ ” 5. I pointed out to the Chief that the boats pertaining to his subjects visited Kateef, and yet he had placed an embargo on the boats of the Bunnyans who possessed property at Kateef. 6. I, moreover, remarked to the Chief that even supposing he possessed a difference with Wahabee Ameer, he had not the authority to place an embargo on Boglabs of British subjects.The Chief replied, do you intend reporting this circumstance to the Resident, because, if you do, when he writes to me I am ready with my answer? 7. Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa is very haughty. His language is full of contumacy, and in the presence of his people he sings the praises of Turkey. 8. His mode of address towards me is very imperious. 9. The last words he spoke to me, respecting the Bunnyans, were that he would expel them from his territory. (True translated Substance.) (Signed) H. F. DISBROWE, Assistant Resident, &amp;c. (True Copy.) (Signed) FELIX JONES, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. In a letter of later date, dated 20th Mohurrum 1275, 30th August 1858, Agent reports the boats and property of Bunnyans to be still under embargo as respected Kateef. 2. The excuse, too, formerly given, no longer held good, for Wahabee Ameer had deputed a person to receive tithe. The Chief’s object is to levy duties on cargo brought specially for the purpose from Kateef to Bahrein, and to lower the dignity of British subjects. 3. The affair of dues extends only to the Bunnyans, the Chiefs own subjects are exempt. The Bunnyans suffer much loss from the Sheikh’s doings, possessing much property in Kateef, but being unable to lay hands on it. (Signed) H. F. DISBROWE, Assistant Resident, &amp;c. (True Copy.)

Dated 22nd Mohurrum 1275, 1st September 1858. We are British subjects. The Bahrein Chiefs behave oppressively, more especially towards British subjects. In remaining silent so long we desired ourselves to bring to a settlement our own affairs, for we are residing in Bahrein island. This year, however, when the Commodore came and levied money, that bore reference to a Bushire Buglah, the Chiefs broke out into enmity with British subjects, and from that date their oppressive behaviour towards us has increased.2. Formerly dues were not levied on exports from Bahrein, but this year, . n without previous notice being given, when all * Meaning “ for exportation. British subjects had purchased* green dates, a system of dues upon the dates was instituted. We agreed, too, to payment of said dues. But we had purchased dates at Kateef, and were desirous, in accor dance with our yearly custom, of despatching our vessels to lade them, when the Chiefs forbade us, and placed an embargo upon our boats, their object being to cause merchandize being brought to Bahrein, that customs might be levied upon it, and it might then be discharged free. W e represented the irregularity of such a proceeding. The Chiefs persisted, we then went to Hajee Jassim,* and acquainted him that our vessels, carrying the British flag, had been placed in embargo, that we were being used oppres sively, and that money was unlawfully being required from us. 3. llajee Jassim called upon the Bahrein Chief, and informed him that he possessed not the right to place an embargo upon a vessel carrying the British flag. The Sheikhs paid no regard to Hajee Jassim’s representations, released not the vessels, and spoke angry words to Hajee Jassim, which had better not be repeated. 4. Their last speech to Hajee Jassim was the following:— “We do not want British subjects in our territories. We are not afraid (of any one). We possess the Turkish flag.” 5. Hajee Jassim then left. Our vessels are still under embargo at Bahrein, and our goods are lying idle at Kateef. We have suffered much loss in conse quence. 6. We hope the Resident will release our goods and our vessels. 7. The Sheikhs wish to borrow money from us. We do not wish to lend. If we lend we are not repaid. If we do not lend we are oppressed in matters of dues. 8. We possess claims upon the Chiefs, and hold Promissory Notes (they have given us). We hope Resident will obtain for us our claims, and arrange matter of dues for us. (True translated substance in brief.) (Signed) H. F. DISBROWE, Assistant Resident, Persian Gulf. No. 306 of 1858. Secret Department. From, Captain Felix Jones, I. N., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. To, Lieutenant H. F. Disbrowe, Assistant Political Resident, Bushire. Sir, The demeanour of the Sheikh of Bahrein towards our Agent at that place, and towards British subjects, and their trade having of late assumed a character more openly unfriendly to our interests, I am induced to despatch youto the island in the hope that your presence with the Sloop-of-war “ Clive” will give better effect to the remonstrances and demands which form the subject of the enclosed letter to the Chief. 2. A translation is appended for your information, and its tenor, with that of the accompanying letters from the complainants, and from the British Agent, will exhibit to you the present bearing of Mahomed bin Khuleefa towards them. 3. Your exertions should be first directed to the release of the vessels bearing the British flag, after being satisfied by examination of the Registers that the boats are fairly entitled to carry such a distinction. Under no circum stances, indeed, has the Sheikh of Bahrein any light to lay an embargo on such vessels, so long as they are pursuing legitimate trade at the risk of their proper owners, whether there be real or professed alarm for their safety in the mind of the Sheikh of Bahrein. 4. His attention should therefore be called to the purport of my letter to him bearing on this part of the case, as, if the right be once conceded, the way ward temper of Arab Sheikhs will hourly find obstacles to place in the path of British commerce, in order to obtain for themselves illicit advantages, or simply to annoy when disposed to be fractious from any cause whatever. 5. Next, I would draw your attention to enquiring into, the nature of the imposts levied on import and export trade there, with a view to lessening them, if found pressing too hard on people under our protection. For this purpose com parison should be made between the duties paid, and the usages in force in res pect to foreign traders and our own, and, should the position of the latter be dis advantageous, you have my authority to protest, in writing, in my name, provided the Sheikh, after friendly remonstrance, is not inclined to ameliorate the condition of our subjects and dependents by placing them on a footing in respect to com merce, with personages of the most favored foreign States. And in respect to the export and import of goods, to and from Bahrein, or any other port by British subjects in vessels other than British vessels, absolute freedom should be insisted on so long as commerce remains unfettered by regulations bearing on the whole community for the general good. 6. Thirdly, the consideration of Mahomed bin Khuleefa should be solicited in behalf of our Agent at his port, and his conduct generally towards the British Government and its authorities, should be exhibited to him in a light which, it is hoped, will cause him to reflect on the folly of continuing in a course antagonistic to the relations, which it is our desire to maintain with him and his people. It should be inculcated that no good can result from opposition and, eccentric as that personage is, I have no doubt that judicious reasoning on your part, coupled with the tone of my letter, will lead him to observe towards us in future a more conciliating manner. 7. Much of Mahomed bin Khuleefa’s behaviour is to be ascribed to his in dividual temperament, and ignorant, haughty and vicious as he is, I would recom mend you to lose no opportunity of addressing yourself to his brother Ali ben Khuleefa, who is the reverse in disposition and in intelligence. My chief object is to avoid a rupture with the Chiefs of Bahrein, for many reasons, which you are •equally aware of, and this will be your great aim, while securing proper treat ment for our subjects, regard to our Counsels, and respect to our Government and its authorities. Through your tact and judgment I hope to effect these ends by persuasive means, but if you find Mahomed ben Khuleefa obdurate, and the terms of his written reply to me consistent with his speech and previous conduct, you will then warn the British Agent and subjects to prepare to quit the Bahrein territory, and 24 hours afterwards if my demands are not conceded, return your self with the “Clive” to this port. 8. In conclusion, I would beg you to lose no opportunity of neutralizing the ill effects of disparaging reports from India, for to these and to the recent intelligence of the fanatical massacre of the European Consuls at Jedda, may.16 perhaps, be attributed the open display of a vindictive spirit always ill-concealed on the part of the Sheikh of Bahrein.

N., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. To, Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, Chief of Bahrein. Dated 27th Mohumim 1275, 6th September 1858. A. C.—Letters have this moment reached me bearing complaints that you have imposed unusual duties and restrictions on British subjects and vessels bearing the British flag. It is my duty, therefore, to lose no time in informing you, that loss and detriment to British traders and their commerce must ensue from so arbitrary an act, which evinces, moveover, as far as I can judge, the same spirit of unfriendliness and disrespect to the British Government as has characterised your proceedings on many occasions. 2. Recently, I was reluctantly compelled to place before you the senti ments of the Sirkar on this head, and as you appear to have disregarded them, I again enclose a copy, begging you to reflect on their purport before engaging in designs which may end injuriously to yourself Further, I now demand in the name of the Sirkar, that, on the receipt of this letter, you will accord permission to the owners or agents of these vessels to prosecute their voyage, and freely to engage in their legitimate pursuits without any molestation what ever, otherwise, I shall hold you responsible for all losses that may result from detention, or in effects consequent thereon. 3. I am aware that yon will endeavour to excuse this act on the ground of expediency rendering it imperative on you to watch over the interests of British subjects residing under protection at Bahrein. This expediency may be based upon real or imaginary dangers impending over the island under your authority, but I am not to be deceived by pretexts of this nature, when the British Government is able to resent any insults that may be offered to vessels trading under its flag, without being indebted to the Sheikh of Bahrein for their, safety when absent from his ports. 4. In the obstructions under notice, and in your general bearing, I think 1 can trace, however, a scheme of an opposite character, alike oppressive to individuals, as disrespectful to the British Government ; otherwise, you would have contented yourself by protesting, or by simply advising the British traders and ship-owners, through the Government Agent, against hazarding the threatened insecurity, leaving it subsequently to them to prosecute or tempora rily to abandon their projects, at their own risk. This is the course you should have pursued, and which, as a well-wisher, I would recommend to you to pursue without loss of time.17 5. My Assistant is now deputed to you on a special Mission, relative to the above subjects. He has his instructions, and I shall be guided by his reports, and your reply to my letter.

N., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Commodore Griffith Jenkins, C. B., Commanding Persian Gulf Squadron, Bushire Roads. Sir, Letters from Bahrein indicate that the Chief of that place has since your late visit there exhibited a very unfriendly bearing towards the Bunnyans, British subjects, residing on that island, and has, moreover, laid an embargo on their Buglahs carrying the British flag. 2. Under these circumstances I have been obliged to address to that Chief a letter of strong remonstrance, which I propose to despatch with my Assistant, Lieutenant Disbrowe, who will be instructed to impress on the Chief the necessity of releasing the detained vessels, as well as to urge him to exhibit towards our Agent, and to British subjects and their affairs in general, such consideration as our mutual relations demand. 3. I am desirous therefore that the Sloop-of-war u Clive” should proceed, with as little delay as possible, to Bahrein. Her presence there, I have reason to think, will further our interests in that quarter, and I shall feel obliged by your issuing the necessary instructions for the accommodation of Lieuten ant Disbrowe, and his party on board. 4. Indisposed as you are, I do not contemplate that you will be personally able to proceed in your Pendant ship on this duty, but I doubt not that Lieutenant Disbrowe will, in any case, derive from the Commander of the vessel such support as may be necessary to him in his intercourse with the authorities of the island. He has instructions to return to this Port “ a discretion,” and I beg therefore you will be good enough to give effect to them in this particular by causing attention to be paid to his wishes.

DISBROWE, Assistant Political Resident, Persian Gulf. iNo. A. of 1858. Secret Department. From, Lieutenant H. F. Disbrowe, Assistant Resident, Persian Gulf on special Mission to Bahrein, To, Captain Felix Jones, I. N., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, Having, in accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your communication in this Department, No. 306, embarked in the H. C.’s Sloop-of- war “ Clive,” bearing the broad pendant of Commodore Jenkins, C. B., I proceeded to Bahrein. 2. The evening of the day of my arrival, which took place on the 10th instant, I had an interview with our Agent, Hajee Jassim, and ascertaining from him that no improvement had occurred in the “ status” of affairs since the date of his last communication to your address, I at once forwarded your letter to Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, together with one from myself, desiring him to comply with your demands lest I should be compelled to carry into execution the instructions I had been entrusted with. I further directed Hajee Jassim, who bore the above missives, to warn all British subjects that they must be prepared to quit Bahrein unless the Chief of the island satisfactorily fulfilled the demands preferred against him. The above measures, you will be happy to learn, supported by the presence of Commodore Jenkins, C. B., resulted in the immediate release of the Buglah, carrying the British flag, that was under embargo, and in the deputation of Sheikh Ali bin Khuleefa to convey to me the Chief’s reply, as also an explanation of his conduct. 3. My interview with Sheikh Ali lasted for more than two hours, and commenced by my impressing upon him in plain and strong language the dangerous course his brother had been pursuing in daring to place an embargo upon a British vessel. As anticipated by yourself, my visitor begged me to believe that his brother, in preventing Buglahs pertaining to British subjects, from repairing to Kateef, had not the slightest intention of shewing disrespect to the British flag. His desire was, as he was at enmity with Kateef, to preclude the chance of disagreeable complications arising from the visit of the Buglahs under reference, and he considered that, being on terms of friendship with the British Government, he might safely, and without offence, adopt the course that he had done. 4. In reply, I assured Sheikh Ali bin Khuleefa that the British flag was fully able to uphold its own dignity in every corner of the globe without assist ance from other Powers. I further pointed to the general character of Bahrein Chief’s proceedings, the offensiveness of his late language towards the British Agent in his island, the insults he had offered in times past, all which, I said, savored of disrespect to the British Government, and rendered it difficult for me to credit the professed disinterestedness of his behaviour. In any case, I observed, viewing the matter of the flag in its mildest light, such conduct betrayed gross ignorance on the part of an independent Ruler.’ I laid bare, too, in plain terms, the inconsistency of Bahrein Chief in imploring our aid and support when a petty Chief, like the A1 Alis, moved out from Demaum, or when the weak Sheikh of the Boo Goowarh repaired to his neighbourhood, and yet, notwithstanding such open confessions of his weakness, daring to place an embargo upon the flag of Great Britain.19 Sheikh Ali bin Khuleefa endeavoured to defend the acts and language of his brother by assuring that he at times spoke and acted in fits of anger 3 and haste, but by no means with an intention to offer insult. I observed that patience and forbearance had their limits. I asked him, too, where the Bahrein Chief would now be had we not upheld him for a period of eleven years, and when, with strange unreasonableness, he began complaining of the incompleteness of our sup port in not utterly incapacitating his evil-wishers from the power to do him evil, I denied point blank that he had not received his full share of consideration, and pointed out that there were other Chiefs and other parties in the Persian Gulf, who were on terms of amity with the British Government, and who were entitled to our favor, as well as the Bahrein Chief. For the rest I remarked that it was not the custom of the British Government to trample upon the powerless, which his expressed expectations at our hands implied he desired that we should do. I concluded by observing that your demands having been complied with, matters, it might be hoped, would be looked upon as disposed of, but the Government not having yet heard of the Bahrein Chiefs conduct it remained to be seen, whether 01 not further satisfaction would be required. This idea, I have deemed it policy that the Bahrein Chief should be impressed with, for such unjustifiable disrespect has he so frequently displayed towards the British Government and its Represen tatives, that it has appeared to me wise to permit a wholesome dread to impend over him, and not to lead him to believe that the simple offer of an apology would suffice for insults oft repeated. I he massacre at Jedda, too, being casually brought under discussion by Sheikh Ali during our interview, and Sheikh All informing me that intelligence had just been received at Bahrein, through the medium of pilgrims, direct from Jedda, that the town and shipping pertaining to latter city had°been visited with severe bombardment. I carefully explained that the affair in question was connected with our flag, hence it might readily be understood that any dis respect that might in other quarters be offered to the British flag would be viewed with the greatest jealousy. The dues levied upon the Bunnyans residing in Bahrein came next under ation. % told Sheikh Ali bin Khuleefa that although you were willing ’t 5. consideration, i told Sheikh Ali bin Khuleefa that although you were willing that the Bunnyans should be subjected to the payment of the same amount of customs as his own subjects, or other foreigners, provided amounts demanded were not arbitrary, still you never could consent to proceedings of an oppressive and un- wanantafle character, such, for instance, as compelling vessels desirous of taking in cargo at one Foreign Port, for conveyance to another Foreign Port, to bring their cargo to Bahrein, and having paid duties thereon proceed to the Port of their final destination. Such acts as these if practised towards others could not be tolerated towards British subjects. No objections were presented to my ar°-u- ments, and the matter I conceived accordingly to be adjusted. 6. I he treatment of our Agent was likewise brought forward by me. I desired Sheikh Ali, as a well-wisher, to exert himself to see that Hajee Jassim received the treatment that was due to him. flajee Jassim, I remarked was not only our Agent but also a guest in the Bahrein Chief’s territories, and had been instructed by me to report carefully any indignities he mbdit be sub jected to. Sheikh Ali readily consented to use his influence to the end in contemplation. 7. Such, in brief, was the purport of my interview with Sheikh Ali bin Khuleefa, who, I conceive, left the H C.’s Sloop-of-war “Clive,” fullv convinced that the patience of the British Government had been sufficiently tried to render a further display of petulance unsafe and unwise. 8. The morning succeeding the visit of Sheikh Ali bin Khuleefa, I received a letter from the Ruling Chief of the Island, expressing his desire to confer with me in person, respecting divers matters connected with my mission, and inviting me to meet him at the house of our Agent, Hajee Jassim. After due deliberation, I decided on declining the proffered invitation, and20 acquainted him, in writing, accordingly, expressing at the same time, however, my readiness to see him on board Commodore Jenkin’s vessel if really desirous of discussing with me affairs connected with his island. The letter containing above sentiments was conveyed to Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa by Hajee Jassim, and I am rejoiced to say that not only did the Chief of Bahrein repair on board the H. C.’s Sloop-of-war u Clive” but in the presence of Commodore Jenkins, C. B, who kindly assisted and supported me with his presence during mv interview, expressed his regret at having, by bis conduct, given cause for offence and disagreement. 9. Your sentiments having doubtless been fully conveyed to Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa by his brother Sheikh Ali, I did not deem it either neces sary or politic to recapitulate or hold again the language I had held whilst remonstrating with Sheikh Ali. Nevertheless, whenever the Bahrein Chief touch ed upon, or drove me to enter any way fully into, matters bearing upon my mission, I did not fail to impress upon him that his own conduct had called down upon him the displeasure of yourself and the British Government. 10. There is one point connected with my interview with Sheikh of Bahrein that demands special notice. At the desire of Commodore Jenkins, C. B., I pointed out the necessity for the Chief, if truly anxious to exhibit his friendliness for the British Government, to display the Arab flag on his fort, when British Men-of-war entered his harbour carrying the British Ensign. Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa readily assented to the Commodore’s propo sal, and in the afternoon of the day of our interview, when Commodore Jenkins, accompanied by the Officers of hfs vessel and myself, repaired on shore to return the Chiefs visit, he hoisted the Arab flag on his residence, and received us with a salute and all honors. Indeed, from the demeanour of Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, I cannot help suspecting he perceives the folly of his late conduct, and feels that, if he embitters the British Government towards him by a continuance of disrespectful language or behaviour, he will lose the best friend and supporter he possesses. 11. I cannot conclude this despatch without expressing my sincere thanks to Commodore Jenkins, C. B., for the very kind and valuable aid he afforded me *by his presence and advice during my negotiations with Bahrein Chief. 12. I should fail in my duty, too, did I omit to notice the material assistance I derived from the tact and thorough knowledge of Arab character displayed by Hajee Ahmed, Arabic Assistant to the Residency, throughout my mission.

If my informants can be relied on, the curse of slavery still lies heavy upon the people of Batinah, and many bund- red slaves are yearly brought from the Zanzibar districts, and landed at places on the Coast, between Muscat and Mussendom. I was told, but cannot helieve, that some hve hundred in number reach every year the neighbourhood of Musnaah alone. On enquiry into the reason of this, I gathered that it was owing to the influ ence of the wild and uncivilized Bedowin. Ihe Bedowins, inhabiting the number less villages that stretch along the Batinah plain in vicinity to the sea-shore, are more powerful than of yore. They have built tor themselves fortlets. They own date plantations. They own vessels. They disregard the commands and authority of the Al-boo-Saeed.* Slaves are landed not precisely at Musnaah, but secretly at places on the shore opposite Bedowin strongholds. Once landed, they are disposed of by private sale, regular brokers being the go-betweens to conduct the sale operations. The selling price may range from dollars ten minimum to dollars forty maximum, young slave girls fetching the highest.”2 d Exteact II.

Boor slaves, thought I, and I came to my tent to chronicle a remark pregnant with so much meaning.” Extract III. April 15 Murray r. “ From enquiries I quietly instituted, relative to Slave Traffic at Murrayr, I gleaned the following J Murrayr vessels proceed annually to the African Slave Coast, laden with salt- hsh, effect, on arnval, a meeting with slave-dealers, and order these heartless wretches to march overland with their slaves to some fixed spot on the shore, res pectably distant from Zanzibar. The slave-purchasers, meanwhile, discharge their salt-fish, sail in the direction of the rendezvous, purposely throw themselves in the way of the English Cruizers, subject themselves to a rigid search, are found S aVeS ’ a ” d are P ermitted t0 Pursue their course. The Cruizers, thus blinded by the native vessel’s pretended honesty, cruize elsewhere, and the native vessel hastens to the appointed spot, takes in her cargo of human flesh, and puts boldly out to sea on her way back to Murrayr. On arrival at Murrayr, the unfortunate creatures are landed, and a tax of two dollars per head is levied by the elders. As many as five hundred slaves have been known to reach Murrayr in one season, but Colonel Playfair’s strenuous efforts to eradicate the traffic, have, I was given to understand, caused a strong reduction of late in the number of imports. Colonel Playfair’s name was familiarly mentioned to me by the Arabs. I hkewise learned that, though Murrayrites are able to bring slaves a oreat portion of the journey overland, they generally carry them entirely by sea for the land trip is attended with considerable extra labor and expense. Murrayr vessels are still said to bring annually from one hundred to one hundred-and-fifty head of slaves. Murrayr has from fifteen to twenty vessels and boats of sizes.” * I speak of the Art-V^f Batinah &amp; - &gt;-■ * Slave-coast. Murrayr, about 180 miles north of Muscat by land. I should be wrong, did I not here mention that both Col. Rigby and Colonel Pellv&gt; predecessors office' of Col. Play fair, strove hard to put down Slave Traffic. ColonelPlayfair, being the present incumbent in po wer, his name was naturally up permost in the mouths of the Arabs. (Sd.) H. F. D.3 Extract IV. April 16 Ghallul Kulbah. (jhallut Kulbah was wrested from the Muscat Sultan in 1850. (Sd.) H. F. D. ' ' “ Ghallut Kulbali has twelve vessels. Eight of these are engaged in the fisheries, and go short voyages. The largest four proceed to Bussorah and the ‘ Sowahil.’ Those wlxich visit the ‘ Sowahil’ carry from Ghallut Kulbah nothing but salt-fish, and return with slaves. Some fifty or sixty slaves are annually imported. A tax of four dollars is levied on each slave landed, but a portion only of the tax reaches the Joasmee Chiefs' coffers. The slaves are clnefiv sold to Bedowins in the interior. Selling-price ranges from fifteen to thirty-five dollars. The course pursued in Slave Traffic by Ghallut Kulbahites is in the main similar to that pursued by Murrayrites. At Ghallut Kulbah I gathered that the further a slave-carrying-vessel lies out at sea, the more secure she feels until she reaches abreast of, or north of, Muscat, when she hugs the land, and sails close in shore to Port. The degree to which Slave Traffic is prosecuted on the Batinah shores I had no conception of, until I made the present trip up the Coast. I am of opinion that until the Ports of import be as effectually blockaded as the Ports of export, the abominable traffic will continue. r l he African Slave Coast has been for years, and still is, under blockade by 'Ptoyal Navy vessels stationed off Zanzibar; but since the abolition of the Indian Navy the system of watch and cruize, so constant and regular off Rasel-el-Hudd and Ras-el-Iludd neighbourhood in Arabia during the first few years of my ser vice in the Persian Gulf, has, of necessity, relaxed, and slave-purchasers in Oman, looking upon one, at least, of the 1 barriers to success as loosened,’ have become buoyant with hope, and persevere in sending their vessels for human cargoes. Soor has long contained more slave carriers and dealers than any other Port probably in Oman, and as regularly as the slave season came round, it was custom ary for one, at least, of the Indian Navy vessels to cruize or lie in wait off Ras-el- Hudd for expected slavers. The duty was a most arduous one, and involved, to say nothing of the exhausting monotony of such a life on such a Coast, consi derable exposure to heat and fatigue in a harassing climate. The blockading vessels were generally sailing ones, and officers and men w'ere frequently away in boats under a burning sun giving chase to suspected craft. Judging from particulars now gleaned on the Batinah Coast, a single sailing ship stationed oft Ras-eTHudd, though doubtless productive of much good, was and is insufficient to cause an extinction of the imports. Slave-dealers and carriers possess ‘long experience, and are closely com bined. Slave trade is with them emphatically a secret service. The moment a locality is effectually watched, the slave-carriers receive accurate information of the fact, information also of the subsequent movements and whereabouts of the blockading vessels, keep aloof during the day, and probably contrive to run in shore or part the vessels during the night. I think the following course, if strictly adopted, (the opinion, how'ever, is submitted with deference to more valuable opinions available), would, in a few years, go far to extinguish, probably extinguish, the Oman traffic, go far also to extinguish the Persian and Turkish traffic via the Gulf. One vessel, sailing or steam, fully equipped for boat service, to be off Ras-el- Hudd, to be mostly at anchor, but occasionally to move a little north and south of her appointed anchorage. %4 A second vessel, a steamer of light draught, likewise well equipped with boats, to he on the move* between Ras-el-Hudd and the entrance to the Gulf, searching every vessel Treaty Engagements permit her to search. * An occasional stretch across to Mekran Coast might be advis- able. This vessel to be essentially erratic. The above measures might prove sufficient to stop importations into Muscat territory, but to render victory more certain, and more especially to prev cut slaves entering the Persian Gulf Waters, I would recommend that a steamer should, during the slave season, be constantly cruizing across the entrance to the Gulf. In this way the Persians, who, via Lingah and Bunder Abbas, receive large instalments of slaves, would, as it seems to me be foiled. I he maritime Arabs, Joasmees, Beniyas, Ejmanees, Boo Fulasaites and Amulgavnu es, would be foiled. Turkish vessels bound to Bussorah with human cargo, would be foiled, and slave- dealers of all the States named would find Slave trade‘so precarious an so unrenmnerative’ that the traffic might reasonably be expected to cease. In the case of Persian vessels, the search would have to be effected in co operation with Persian officials; and Turkish vessels found carrying slaves, won d have to be conveyed to the nearest Turkish Port for adjudication. Ihese consi derations would, of course, be borne in mind by the English Ciuizers. A lew other points seem deserving of remembrance. FirstlyWhen is the slave season in and about the Persian Gulf? In other words, from what date unto what date would slave search have to be prosecuted in the Gulf quarter? The season* for vessels to cruize after slavers coming from Zanzibar and the African Coast, is from March 15th to the 1st, or perhaps 15th of June; for slavers coming from the lied Sea from August 20th to Octobei 30th yeaily. Secondly We must be prepared to cause intense and increased irritation, should we carry into effect with increased vigour our determination to crush Slave Traffic. To quote only one instance that has come to my knowledge. It is known that the slave-dealers from Soor, who, during their visits to Muscat, frequent a coffee-shop called llajee Furruj’s, were in the habit of talking all manner of abuse against Colonel Rigby, at the time when he moved so actively with the Zanzibar Sultan in slave matters, and took part in so many successful captures of slave crafts. Royal Navy vessels captured our vessels, said the Soorees, but Colonel Rigby was at the bottom of the mischief. If we feared not the English, they said, we would go in broad noonday to the Political Agency, and tear Colonel Rigby to pieces, so intense is our hatred of him. Thirdly:—The greater our struggle to,extinguish Slave traffic, the greater the sufferings of the slaves, who are exported and imported. Some, perhaps, of these will, owing to our pursuit of the vessels they are borne in, be committed to the deep by their heartless carriers. Many, perhaps, most of these will, owing to the barbarous measures that are sure to be resorted to ensure their concealment, be subjected to inconceivable cruelty during the voyage from Africa to Arabia. Lastly, I cannot help recording that, as a rule, the treatment of the African slave » y his master in Eastern Arabia is kind and humane. Once domiciled, the slave appears to forget his degraded position, and becomes seemingly happier far than his master. In Muscat, the Arab, be he rich, be he poor, is little given to merriment, hospitality, or good fellowship; whereas the Sowalnlees hold frequent ‘reunions/ and', to judge from their countenances and demeanour, are veritably happy. Girls, hoys, women and men meet, laugh, dance, sing an amuse themselves. The same holds good in the districts and villages ontsi e Muscat, with this exception that the Arab of the country is more open-handed and sociable than the Arab of the Capital. (Sd.) H.F.D.

GEORGE PERCY BADGER, In charge Muscat-Zanzibar Commission, To A. KINLOCH FORBES, Esq., Acting Secretary to Government, Bombay. Secret Department. Aden, 3rc? June 186L Sir, —Agreeably with the instructions conveyed to mein your letter, No. 1697 of 1861, I took advantage of my late visit to Muscat, to collect all available infor mation respecting the coast from Bunder Abbas to Kurrachee, bearing in any way on the suggested line of Electric Telegraph between those places, to be extended from Bunder Abbas to Basra or Baghdad. I was fortunate in finding at Muscat several very intelligent Beloochee Chiefs, who were well acquainted with the social and political condition of the intermediate countries, and whose statements have enabled me to form a tolerable estimate of the difficulties, as well as of the facilities, attached to the proposed scheme. These I shall now proceed to set forth for the information of the Honorable the Governor in Council. 2 . The territory between Bunder Abbas and Sudeij, a place on the coast, about sixty miles eastward of the small town of Jashk, is at present under the juris diction of Seyyed Thoweynee of Muscat, who holds it in farm from the Persian Government, under the conditions of the treaty concluded with that Government by His late Highness Seyyed Saeed in 1856. Meer Hussein, the existing governor of Jashk, on the part of His Highness Seyyed Thoweynee, and whom I saw at Muscat, informed me that the country between Jashk and Bunder Abbas was here and there well cultivated, especially in the vicinity of the villages, and afforded, moreover, extensive pasturage grounds for the numerous flocks kept by the Belooches. He gave the following as the principal villages on the ordinary route between Jashk and Bunder Abbas:— From Jashk to Koh (Moobarek) 6 hours. „ Koh to Gattan 1 „ „ Gattan to Sereck 18 „ „ Sereck to Gran (Gron) 1 J „ „ Gron to Kustack 6 „ ,, Kustack to Minan 12 „ „ Minan to Bunder Abbas 12 „ Meer Hussein represented the inhabitants of this district as quiet and peaceable, 12 and saw no difficulty whatever in the establishment of the Electric Telegraph alon&lt;v that line of the coast, if Seyyed Thoweynee undertook to protect it, and if the Persian Government sanctioned the enterprise. 3. His Highness Seyyed Thoweynee has officially intimated to Government* * See his letter to Sir George Ws readinCSS t0 c °-°P cr a‘e the undertaking, wherever Clerk in my Report No. 6 of his jurisdiction extended, and he repeatedly assured me of his ability to protect the line from Bunder Abbas to Jashk and Sudeij, if not interfered with by the Persians. This latter proviso com prises a consideration of serious importance in connection with the suggested scheme since, according to the conditions of the treaty referred to in paragraph 2 the Sultan of Muscat is bound to exclude the agents of any foreign Government from the territories comprised within the limits of the farm, and by the general tenor of the articles of that treaty, His Highness is obviously deprived of the prerogative of granting an absolute permission for such an undertaking as the Electric Telegraph between Bunder Abbas and Sudeij. The correctness of this reference will be apparent to the Government after a perusal of the treaty itself, which I purpose attaching to my next letter, and which I beg to suggest may be read in connection with this report, on account of the bearing of many of the remarks therein made on the subject of the proposed Electric Telegraph along the coast of Mekran. Seyyed Thoweynee pretends, of course, that the Persian Government have no right to interfere with any concessions which he may please to make within the limits of his farm, and he would be doubtless highly gratified to find that the British Government were disposed to back his pretentions; but with the treaty before me, I do not see how we could enter into any definite arrangement with His Highness regarding the establishment of the Electric Telegraph between Bunder Abbas and Sudeij, without obtaining the prior consent of the Shah of Persia, whose sovereign rights over that territory are specially reserved by the terms of the said treaty. On the other hand, however, the distinct acknowledgement by the British Government of the sovereignty of Persia over those districts, (which would be necesr-aiil} involved in the application for any such concession from the Shall,) might be very undesirable in a political point of view, and more especially so at the pre&gt;ent time, when the Persians are actively engaged in aggressive movements on Mekran and towards Beloochistan. Not feeling competent to discuss this delicate question any further, I pass on to a description of the coast eastward of Sudeij. 4. The country from Sudeij to Jez, a distance of 150 miles, is within the juris diction of Meer Abdullah bin Moorad Mahomed, described as a powerful Beloochee Chief and an efficient ruler, preserving order and tranquillity among the tribes subject to his rule. He became tributary to Persia about twelve years ago, and still professes to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Shah; but by all accounts, lu i Abdullah would be glad of an opportunity to regain his independence. Mv Beloochee informants assured me that he was quite capable of protecting a line of telegiaph along the coast included within his jurisdiction, and they felt persuaded he would willingly accede to any proposition from the British Government on the subject. But here also the same question arises, how far he could do so on his/ J \ % own authority, consistently with his obligations to the Persian Government; and again, how far it would be politic on our part, or fair towards this chief, to seek any concession from the Shah, in a territory which the Belooches still regard as their own, though for the time wrongfully wrested from them by the Persians. Further, there is reasonable ground to fear that any such recognition by us of the sovereign rights of Persia over those districts, w'ould lead the Native Chiefs to do all in their power to frustrate the success of a scheme obtained, as they would judge, at the expense of their national independence. 5. Close to J£z is Charbar, a small town on the coast, subject to the Sultan of Muscat, whose jurisdiction extends over a wild rocky country to the vicinity of Gwettur. Charbar was taken by Seyyed Sultan, grandfather of the present ruler of Muscat, about a century ago, and has since remained in the undisputed possession of his successors. Unless interfered with by the aggressive designs of the Persians, or of the Khan of Khelat, Seyyed Thoweynee would have no difficulty in securing a line of telegraph through this district. 6. The small town of Gwettur belongs to one Been Mahomed, a petty independent chief of a neighbouring tribe of the Zidgal; and from Gwettur to Jewnee, the coast is subject to Lalla Midyan, a Beloochee Chief of the Sheikh Zada tribe, who resides at Jewnee, and who is also described as being independent. The country here about is very barren, and the people miserably poor. A small subsidy to these chiefs would doubtless suffice to engage them to protect the Telegraph through their respective territories. 7. Next to Jewnee is the town of Gwader or Gw^adel, owned by SevyecP^ Thoweynee of Muscat, and governed at present by his deputy Seif bin Salem, of the Al-boo-Saeedy tribe of Arabs. The customs of the port are estimated at 4,000 dollars per annum, and are held at that rate by the Banyan who farms all the Muscat customs dues. I perceive that Major Green suggests, in his letter dated 27th March, to the Political Superintendent, Upper Scinde, that this place should be purchased by us from the Sultan of Muscat, and then made over to the Khan of Khelat, on the ground that the latter has valid claims to its possession, and has more than once intended to seize it; moreover, that its possession by Khelat would be advantageous to the Khan, and perhaps to ourselves also, as well in a political point of view, asi more immediately in connection with the suggested line of Electric Telegraph along the coast of Mekran. 8. I have made careful enquiry into the statement whereon it is said, the present Khan rests his claim to the town and port of Gwadel, namely, that it was merely lent to Syud Sultan, the Imam of Muscat, about the middle of the last century, to enable him to quell an insurrection in some of his territories on the Coast to the westward, after which it was to be restored to its owner; but that the then Khan dying, and the country falling into a state of anarchy, the successors of Seyyed Sultan had taken advantage of those circumstances to retain possession of Gwadel. The story is a plausible one, but I believe it to be wholly without foundation. 1 consider Seyyed Thoweynee’s plea that it was conquered bv his grandfather Seyyed Sultan to be equally invalid. The most probable account of the S Xs Amanner in which Gwadel fell into the hands of Seyyed Sultan, was given me by an old Beloochee Chief at Muscat, whose relatives have been in the service of the Imam for several generations, and whose narrative of facts I found to correspond generally with the native chronicles of those times. He states that Seyyed Sultan, the fifth, but the bravest son of Imam Ahmed, the first of the reigning Muscat dynasty, hav ing rebelled against his father, repaired to the Khan of Khelat, and sought his aid in dethroning him. The Khan, wishing to have a friendly power possessed of a naval force to protect his coast, and foreseeing that Sultan would eventuallv &gt;succeed to the Muscat sovereignty, so far volunteered his assistance, as to give him in perpetuity the town and port of Gwadel, the only attached condition beino- that he should always defend the place against the enemies of Khelat, Considering the unimportance of Gwadel at the time, and the Khan’s inability, from want of ships, to guard it from attack, there is no improbability in this story, and several of the facts on which it is founded are supported by contemporary Arabian historians. It will doubtless be easy for the present Khan to dispute this statement, or to set aside the prescriptive right of undisputed possession by the successive rulers of Muscat for upwards of a century ; and he may further deem himself justified in establishing his claim by force ; but I am at a loss to perceive how such success would benefit him permanently, or prove of any advantage to the furtherance of the Telegraph scheme. Seyyed Thoweynee would certainly oppose any attempt of the kin 1, and although it is probable that he would be unable to resist a determined land attack by the Khan’s army, one of his ships of war would suffice to blockade the port, and to cut off all communication with the sea, thereby stopping effectually all trade, and doing serious injury to the Khan’s inland territories. 9. Cn the 'whole, therefore, it appears to me that the influence of our Agent at ivheiut 'would be best used in dissuading the Khan from any such enterprise. Ills abstinence therefrom will prevent complications most detrimental to the growing tiadc of those parts; will entail on himself no damage; and will leave him and us \wtn a friendly ally at Gwadel, whose good offices may be relied on in any matter hciein Biitish interests are concerned. I found that Seyyed Thoweynee was well aware of the attack which the Khan meditated against Gwadel in 1857, and he seemed to know moreover, that that Chief had not relinquished the idea of seizing it; but the Khan is represented as hesitating to carry out his purpose, owing to the in gent expostulations of his kinsman the Jam of Beyla, who is reported to have frequently dissuaded him from the undertaking, on the ground that it would be a violation of the promise made by his grandfather to Seyyed Sultan. I have been uko assuied that the Belooches at Gwadel are quite satisfied with the Muscat rule, for Seyyed Thoweynee levies no tax on them ; and with a view of feeling them selves more safe from an attack by the Khan, they have urged His Highness to build a wall round the town, and he has promised to accede to the request as soon as possible. 10. I ne country between Gwadel and Punsinee, a distance of eighty miles, belongs to Khelat, and the general testimony of the Arabs and Belooches, with wnom 1 conversed on the subject at Muscat, agree in the opinion, that protected by5 Sultan, was given me by an :n in the service of the Imam &gt;und to correspond generally lat Seyyed Sultan, the fifth, gning Muscat dynasty, hav- f Khelat, and sought his aid friendly power possessed of it Sultan would eventually d his assistance, as to give ly attached condition beino 1 the enemies of Khelat. id the Khan’s inability, from probability in this story, and J by contemporary Arabian an to dispute this statement, ssion by the successive rulers ther deem himself justified o perceive how such success ige to the furtherance of the y oppose any attempt of the nable to resist a determined ir would suffice to blockade thereby stopping effectually territories. the influence of our Agent from any such enterprise, detrimental to the growing and will leave him and us be relied on in any matter seyyed Thoweynee was well : Gwadel in 1857, and he pushed the idea of seizing t his purpose, owing to the , who is reported to have ground that it would be a 'yed Sultan. I have been sfied with the Muscat rule, -h a view of feeling them- r e urged His Highness to to accede to the request \ | J \ 1 * &amp; ** I distance of eighty miles, irabs and Belooches, with i opinion, that protected by the vigorous authority of the present Khan, the Electric Telegraph would be perfectly sale through that district. An equally favorable opinion was expressed regarding the feasibility of the scheme between Punsinee and Sonmeeanee. The intermediate line of coast belongs to the Jam of Beyla, (or the Jam of the Zidgal, as he is more usually st) led,) a Chief, who appears to be universally respected for his integrity and good government. He is said to be cousin to Khodadad Khan, the Khan of Khelat, acknowledging his suzerainty, but being in reality quite independent of him within his own territories. 11. I have deemed it superfluous to enter into any details of the country between Bunder Abbas and Bushire. That tract being bond fide Persian territory, and the coast being inhabited by a civilized population largely engaged in trade, no serious obstacles to the successful establishment of a line of telegraph can exist there, should the Persian Government undertake to protect it. I have also purposely omitted any suggestions regarding stations, for the simple reason that 1 anticipate no difficulty whatever on that score, but the selection must be left to the officers who may be deputed hereafter to survey the route. All these points, however, are very secondary to the important political questions involved in this scheme. Persia is extending her conquests eastward, not far north of the projected line, and the Beloochee tribes, who once claimed the coast, are gradually losing their indepen dence. Reliable intelligence reports her troops to be in force not far from Kej, and it is believed that they will eventually invade the territories of the Khan of Khelat. Apart from the more momentous considerations involved in the progress of Persian supremacy in Central Asia, and its bearing on our eastern policy, the actual con quests of the Persians, on the line of the projected telegraph route, cannot be over looked in connection with that scheme. If we had to negotiate only with the Jam of Beyla, the Khan of Khelat, the Beloochee Chiefs on the coast, and with His Highness Seyyed Thoweynee of Muscat, I feel convinced that, with prudent management, the Electric Telegragh might be set up at once from Kurrachee to Bunder Abbas, and lie maintained in perfect security. But in view of the predominance lately acquired by Persia in those parts, can we safely set aside her claims to be consulted on the subject; safely, I mean, as regards the projected scheme? Yet, if any conces sion is asked of Persia, as respects her lately acquired possessions in Mekran, shall w r e not thereby recognize a right which may be fraught with serious consequences hereafter, and thereby also give the Native Chiefs of those districts just cause to regard us as the allies of their hated invaders, instigating them by such a course to thwart the protected scheme in a thousand ways, which no Persian force could effectually prevent ? This point, as I have already observed, is one of such delicacy, that I abstain from discussing it any further, and shall therefore submit it in the very imperfect form in which it has been stated, to the serious consideration of the Honorable the Governor in Council. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) GEORGE PERCY BADGER, In charge Muscat-Zanzibar Commission.•» From Major HENRY GREEN, C.B., Political Agent, Khelat, lo the POLITICAL SECRETARY, Bombay. Bombay, 23rd June 1861. ^ IR &gt; I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government, the following Report on the Ports of Gwadur and Ormara, situated on the Mekran Coast, with a view to their future utility as Telegraph Stations, as well as other information regarding that Coast. II. M. S. “ Hugh Lindsay’ having been placed at my disposal by the Bombay Government, I embarked on board her in Kurrachee harbour, accompanied by Major Malcolm Green, on the 28th of May, and at noon weighed anchor for Gwadur, where we arrived at 6 a. m. on the morning of the 30th, anchoring at about two miles from the shore in Sg- fathoms ol w r ater. I immediately landed, accompanied by Captain Darke, of the “ Hugh Lindsay,” and Major Green, and proceeded to the ^ residence of the Governor, who is placed there by the Imaum of Muscat. \Ve were received in the gateway of a small fort and treated with every civility, and having expressed my intention of visiting the surrounding country during the day, and - requested that camels or some other means of locomotion might be provided, we returned on board, soon after which the Governor dispatched his two sons to pay their respects. J hey were accompanied by the principal merchants and inhabitants of the place, and brought presents of sheep, fowls, sweetmeats, and fruit. By the kindness of Captain Darke, they were permitted to range about the ship, and the engines were put in motion for them. Having made some small presents to the sons of the Governor, they returned on shore, and about 2 p. m. I again landed, and at the Governor’s residence found camels waiting. After partaking of coffee, I mounted, to visit the surrounding country, and w r as accompanied, and driven on a camel, by an individual denominated a Wuzzeer, - ^ but whose appearance in no way gave an idea of the high position a person thus designated holds at a Native court in India, his only costume consisting of a pair of loose trowsers, and these none of the cleanest. The animal we bestrode was a fast Mekran camel, but being quite untrained, and without saddle or stirrups, rendered this part of the trip none of the pleasantest. The Wuzzeer, however, was a man of excellent humour, most obliging, and full of local information, which was inter preted with the assistance of the Nacoda of a Pattimar, who was in the habit of trading to India. We were also accompanied by a rabble of sort, some on foot, some on camels, all armed, even to the smallest boy, carrying an Arab dagger stuck into his ragged waistband ; all were, however, in excellent temper and spirits. Having seen all that could be seen, I returned on board by 8 p. m., after having distributed a few presents amongst those who had made themselves most useful. Whilst on shore2 V \ I ( I met a Belooch Chief, by name Nubbee Buccus, a Coudaie, with whom I had become acquainted at Khelat the previous year; he resides between Keaj and Gwadur, and offered every assistance if I wished to go into the interior. 2. Gwadur is situated in longitude 62° 15' 40' E., and in latitude 25° 6' 40 ,/ N., about 300 miles west of Kurrachee, and 400 east of Bunder Abbass. The harbour, or rather bay, is easy of entrance at any season, having no bar, and being- protected from the S. W. Monsoon by a range of nearly perpendicular rocks, between 300 and 400 feet high, running nearly east and west for a distance of a mile and three quarters into the sea, thus forming a perfect breakwater against the swell caused by the S. W. Monsoon, and under the protec tion of which, vessels drawing up to 18 feet water can anchor in four fathoms in perfect safety. Should the wind come from the S.E., a vessel has only to run Harbour. round the head of Ras Nao, and anchor in six fathoms on the N. W. side of this range. It may here be remarked that the S. W. Monsoon seldom blows home on this coast, but never- theless causes a high and dangerous swell: the rise and fall of the tide is between three and five feet, flie bay abounds in fish of every description. No. V. in Chart. Harbour. No. V. in Chart. Village. 3. The village of Gwadur is built at the foot of the range of rocks above- mentioned, and which abruptly terminate at their western extremity ; the whole range extending only three miles. It is here met by a sandy beach, on which the village is situated. This consists of about 600 mat huts, formed into narrow lanes, the principal one leading up to the Governor’s residence—a small square building of mud. The bazaar contains about 40 bunniah shops; the lemaining huts are inhabited by Arab fisherman, and the crews of boats trading to India, Muscat, and the Persian Gulf. Outside the village are pitched the black camel-hair tents of the migratory tribes of Belooch, who come from .the interior bringing sheep, wool, carpets, ghee, and dates. Village. Fresh-water. Fresh-water is procured from Avells dug about one mile north of the town, and these are about eight feet deep. I inspected them, and found the v atei excellent, and was informed that any amount was procurable by digging. Supplies. The surrounding country is quite barren, and the inhabitants are dependent principally on Kurrachee for grain; but when rain has fallen in the inteiioi gieat quantities are brought for sale. Sheep and fowls are brought in by the Belooch, and I was informed that by giving a day’s notice, any number of them would be procurable. The sheep which I saw were of the Doomba species, of a good size; their wool also appearing of a good quality. hade. The export trade of Gwadur consists of wool, ghee, and dates, which ait biought fiom the interior of Mekran by the Belooch, and exchanged for English piece-goods, grain, gunpowder, and other commodities. I was informed that yearly American ships arrived, their owners buying up the wool, and taking it direct to L v3 iu) 11 \ J America. I should say, however, that two vessels of 500 tons each would carry ofl the whole of the wool of the season. A vessel belonging to this nation was expected to arrive daily when we left. Custom Duties .— Ihe custom duties of the Port of Gwadurare yearly farmed «/ •/ out by the Imaum of Muscat, and have been taken this year by a Kurrachee Bun- niah, who has paid Rs. 6 , 000 . Trade by boats is carried on with Muscat throughout the year, but is closed to the eastward after the first week in May. Climate. The climate of Gwadur appears salubrious,—the month of May being considered the hottest during the year. From personal observation I ascertained that the thermometer in in}' cabin on board the “ Hugh Lindsay” at 8 a. m. stood at 84° Fahrenheit, and at 2 p. m. at 90°. When on shore, and exposed to the sun during the greatest heat of the day, I experienced no inconvenience, and, from lonii' experience of the climate of Sind, should say that there was little difference between that of Kurrachee and Gwadur. Road to Kurrachee .—During my stay I made every inquiry regarding the coast-route to Kurrachee, and ascertained, from those who were constantly in the habit of travelling it, that it presented no difficulties ; and that when the sea- route was closed, it was daily traversed by traders and others; and that with the exception of a scarcity of water at one or two of the halting-places, no difficulties of any sort presented themselves; that all along the coast the people were inoffensive, and that the road was entirely free from freebooters of any sort. Hills near Gwadur .—On ascending the range of hills, at the foot of which the village is situated, I found on the summit a curious natural reservoir for water, of Luge extent, with a most scientifically constructed stone bund, for the purpose of preventing the water from escaping down the eastern side of the hills. Feeling convinced that it could not have been constructed by the present inhabitants, 1 made inquiiies, and was informed that it had been built m former days by Femmees, bv which I am led to suppose that the Portuguese were intended, and that in all pro bability when they possessed Ormus and other Ports in the Persian Gulf, Gwadur was not neglected by them, either as a trading port, or as a harbour of refuge dur ing bad weather. It also appears that in former times the Belooch tribes from the interior were in the habit of making raids into Gwadur with the view of plunder, and that on these occasions the inhabitants sought shelter in the hills, which, from the difficulty of access, a single path rendered a few resolute men capable of defending themselves against large bodies,-—and this alone appears one of the principal reasons for preserving the water. Several old tombs were also shown me as havin«- been built by the same people who constructed the bund. There were, however, no inscriptions on them. Having now seen and ascertained all that I possibly could regarding Gwadur and its neighbourhood, we weighed anchor on the evening of the 29th and shaped our course for Ormara. I much wished to visit Pissmiee and Kulmut, ports Ivino- between Gwadur and Ormara, but the very heavy surf, lateness of the season, and4 reported shallowness of the water near the coast, determined me, after consultation with Captain Darke, not to risk the steamer by attempting it. We anchored in the bay of Ormara at noon, on the 30th, in five fathoms water, at a distance of about five miles from the shore. This port, although protected to a certain extent from the S. W. Monsoon, is by no means equal to Gwadur, the surf at times running so heavy as to prevent all com munication with the shore. On landing we found a small village consisting of about 200 mat huts, the inhabitants being fishermen and crews of coasting vessels. They appeared a most inoffensive race, and we did not see a single armed man amongst them. The country around is quite barren ; the water was described as very indif ferent. We being the first Europeans who had ever landed there, were naturally looked upon with great curiosity. Having re-embarked, we started for Kurrachee» arriving there at noon on the 1 st of June. During the above visit every possible information was obtained from every description of person as to the line of coast from Kurrachee to Gwadur, as well as to the temper and state of the tribes along it. With regard to the setting up of the line no physical difficulties of any conse- quence present themselves. From Has Kutchuree [vide Chart) to Ras Malan, the line would have to be carried over a low spur of mountains from the main range. From Ras Senny to Ras Bussool, and from Shemaul Bunder to Ras Koppak, this again will have to be done. The whole of the rest can be carried along the line of coast, close to the sea. For the stations I would certainly suggest that Gwadur be selected as a principal one, both from its central position (being nearly equidistant between Kurrachee and Bunder Abbass), its capabilities as a harbour, excellent water, and salubrious climate, rendering it fitted for the residence of European. Four other inferior stations might be selected to the eastward between Gwadur and Kur- No in. on cliart! rachee, viz. Pissanee, IV ” Kulmut, nr - Oomasa, II r and Sonmeeanee, I- and five to the westward, between Gwadur and Bunder Abbass, all to be subordinate to Gwadur. The whole of the coast lying eastward of Gwadur, as far as the Ilubb river, close to Kurrachee, forms part of Beloochistan, and belongs to His Highness the Khan ol Khelat. The Town and Port of Gwadur, although at present under the jurisdiction of the Imaum of Muscat, is claimed by His Highness the Khan of Khelat, to whose ancestor, Nusseer Khan, it undoubtedly belonged. In a former report to No. V. on Chart. No. II. on Chart. No. I. on Chart. Government on this subject, I pointed out the manner in which it came into the hands of the Imaum, and at the same time suggested that it might be purchased by the British Government, and restored to the Khan of Khelat. From information gained by me on the spot, I have reason to believe that the Imaum would be willing to give over all claims for a sum equivalent to two years’ purchase of the Port- dues : these average about Rs. 6000 yearly ; I should therefore say that the port might be purchased for about Rs. 12,000 or 15,000. Should the above suggestionmeet with approval, it would place the whole line of coast from Gwadur to Kurrachee mnder the control of one chief, with whom certain conditions miaht be then entered into for the protection of the line ; it would also put a stop to the constant disputes which occur between the subjects of the Belooch Chief and those of the Imaum, on the matter of the rightful possession of Gwadur. With a view to the carrying into effect the above proposition, I would suggest that a carefully selected British Officer be sent to reside at Gwadur, and that he be appointed an Assistant to the Political Agent at Khelat; that His Highness the Khan then be instructed to select and appoint one of his most trustworthy officers as Governor of the Port. This having been arranged, I consider that a subsidy of Rs. 20,000 or £ 2,000 per annum might be granted to His Highness the Khan for the purpose of protecting the line between Kurrachee and Gwadur, which might be effected by Ilis Highness taking into his pay a certain number of men of the tribes located near the different stations to act as police, and to constantly patrol the line. The subsidy should be under the control of the English Officer, who would see that it was properly spent, and for the purpose for which it was given. His Highness the Khan should further be distinctly informed that the Port of Gwadur and its revenues were given over to him for the express purpose of his assisting, by every means in his power, to afford protection to the line. The British Officer at Gwadur should be allowed a liberal establishment, and a small escort of Belooch, mounted on horses or camels. A small steam despatch boat, of about 400 tons, should also be kept at Kurrachee or Gwadur for the purpose of frequently running along the whole coast between Kurrachee and Bunder Abbass or Bushire, visiting the different stations, and landing at different parts of the coast to inspect the line. As new and fast steamers arrive for the River Indus, the old Planet ” or “ Satellite” strengthened might be used at present for the above purpose. The above arrangements appear to me practical enough, but much will depend upon the Officer selected to carry them out. I anticipate no difficulty or opposition from the tribes inhabiting the coast. They are a quiet, inoffensive race, quite different in manner, feeling, and habits from the wild mountaineers of the interior; but how ever wild or barbarous, experience has taught me that a firm, conciliatory, straight forward, and liberal line of conduct towards them will always give them confidence, and that once gained, anything may be done with them. We have at present a great advantage in having, as the Chief of the Belooch State, a young Prince, whose* sympathies and feeling tend towards a close union with the British Government ;• and I most earnestly hope that every means will be exerted to retain him in this course, as I cannot but feel convinced that the day is not far distant, when the friendship or enmity of him and his people will be of vital importance to British interests in the East. In the above report I have merely drawn attention to that part of the coast lying between Kurrachee and Gwadur, because it is that part with which I am best acquainted, and with whose people and ruler I have been for the last four vearsV 6 mt V , , , . t l,„ swe time I believe the line could bo carried to Bunder intimately connec u . co . 0 peration of the Persian Government having Abbass with equal facd.ty, P ^ ob9ervation&gt; that a well-select- ^ considered a boon by all the inbabi- L bv tact judgment, and honesty of purpose and earnestness m Ins tants, and that b } tact, j ^ ^ name along tlie coast, but tend work be non . j believe&gt; f ovme rly flourished.

P. Darke, Esquike, Commanding H. M's Steamer “Hugh, Lindsay' upon the Meckeran Coast, during the late trip of that vessel with Major II. Green, C.B., on duty. On Tuesday 28th May, at 1 r. m., having received on board Major II. Green, C.B., Political Agent at Khelat, proceeded from Kurrachee towards the Mecke ran Coast, arriving at Goradel at day-light of the 30th, and, anchoring in 3 fathoms low-water, landed in company with Major Green, and made every enquiry respecting this place as to its capabilities as a sea and commercial port, climate, weather, and natural phenomena of the surrounding country, and report as follows:— 2. The town of Goradel is situated at the foot of a lone: ran 2 :e of hills runnine; o o o nearly due East and West, and forming a promonotory, terminating in a Cape called “ Rasshoo,” easily distinguishable by a single tree on the extreme point. The town consists of about COO huts, constructed of reeds, sand and mud, the fort being the only building built of stone: the Bazaar is narrow, and consists of about 40 Banian shops, the goods exposed for sale consisting of European piece- goods, dates, rice, &amp;c. &amp;c. On further enquiry respecting the water, I ascer tained the best to be obtained was situated about one mile to the northward of the town, of good quality and abundant. With regard to the supplies, I learned that upon two or three days’ notice being given, any number of sheep and fowls could be had, also a species of check cloth manufacture and camel hair mats, but these had to be brought from the interior, and hence the delay. As regards the capabilities of the Harbour, my opinion is that it is well adapted for ships draw ing 18 feet or under ; is well sheltered from the southward, can be entered without danger at all times, and affords a good refuge for ships in the south-west mon soon. The approaches are bold, the water gradually shoaling on the western store from 15 fathoms to the anchorage, three miles from the shore, in 3 J fathoms, the town bearing west. During the months of June and July it is much frequented by the American whalers, who come here to refit and buy up the cotton, of which there is a small quantity obtainable. There arc several native craft, the property of Banians, belonging to the port, which trade to the Malabar Coast, Bombay, Muscat, and the Persian Gulf; but these were nearly all hauled on shore, the trade to the southward being closed during the monsoon, although carried on all the year round with Muscat and the Persian Gulf. I also observed several new craft of large dimensions in course of construction. The inhabitants, who consisted mostly of Arabs, were friendly and obliging, and, from observation, tolerably industrious, though not cleanly in themselves or habits. 3. Major Green having completed his observations, I proceeded on the even- imr of the 30th for Orcmarrah, situated about 130 miles to the eastward of Goradel, arriving at noon of the 31st, and found it also situated at the foot of a long range of high hills, the extremity forming a Cape called Ras Arubah, or Oremarrah, proved to be only a small fishing village, without any resources whatever, with very inferior water, and the inhabitants quite poor, all their supplies beingFrom LIEUTENANT COLONEL A. B. KEMBALL, C.B., Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, To II. L. ANDERSON, Esquire, Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Political Agency in Turkish Arabia, Baghdad, llh May 1861. Sir, —Having perused your circular despatch, No. 72, of 7th January, enclos ing a letter from the Rev. Mr. Badger, of the 17th December last, as well as Dr. Hy si op’s report of the 10th ultimo, on the subject of telegraphic communication between India and England, I have the honour to state, with respect to the several matters therein discussed— \stly .—As regards the first section, between Constantinople and Baghdad, that Mr. Badger’s suggestions have, I believe, been fully anticipated in my reports of the actual state of the line, of which copies have been already submitted to Government 2ndly .—As regards the second section, between Baghdad and the sea, that Dr. Hyslop’s proposal to lay a sub-fluvial cable would be unimpeachable, could the one condition of perfect and constant insulation of the wire be attained, but that in the present state of sub-aqueous Telegraphy, the very advantage to which he refers, viz. the speedy embedment of the cable in alluvium, forms one of the principal objections to its use. And finally, as regards the third and fourth sections, viz. between Busreh and Bunder Abbas, along the Persian coast, and between Bunder Abbas and Kurrachee, along the Mekran coast, that assuming an aerial line, if by any means practicable, to be incomparably superior to submarine communication, I incline to concur in the suggestions of the Rev. Mr. Badger, and even to believe that he has over-estimated the difficulties which at present militate against their adoption. The principal objection it appears to me to his scheme is one of a political character, founded on the fact that the proposed line must for more than half its length traverse the territory of a government the consistency or the friendliness of whose policy towards us may not always be relied upon ; but this objection set aside, and the good will of the Shah secured, I should apprehend even less difficulty in subsidizing the tribes who inhabit the Persian coast than is to be anticipated from the tribes whose co-operation is on the point of being tested in this quarter. Of the inhabitants of the Mekran coast, I am unable to speak with equal confidence, though the circumstances mentioned by Mr. Badger doubtless furnish sufficient motives to enter at once upon the examination of the country.2 The natural and physical difficulties of the undertaking I presume to be nil, or of a nature to he easily surmounted, while, owing to the immediate proximity of the sea, the advantages afforded in the matter of transport of material, of security, as placing the measure to that end more immediately under our own control, and finally, of greater facility of supervision, cannot be overrated. As regards alternative lines, too much stress cannot, I think, be laid upon their value, whenever they can be rendered available; but whether the starting point be taken from Bunder Abbas or Bushire, or any other intermediate town on the coast to Tehran, it appears to me that this is a consideration which can be in no degree affected by the determination of the question now under discussion, seeing that were the choice to fall eventually upon submarine communication, the use of three or more cables, each comprising one wire, would be found to be preferable, I believe, in every respect to one cable, comprising many wires. On this particular head, how ever, I beg to annex a Memorandum by my Engineer Assistant, Mr. Greener. As regards the maintenance of communication between Baghdad and Bussorah, for a special or temporary purpose, I may mention that T29 hours and 99 hours represent respectively the average passage during two years of the steamer “ Comet” up and down the river. Although this average scarcely exceeds days, I concur in opinion with Dr. Hyslop, that the employment of more efficient Steamers must be desirable when speed and punctuality are required. The distance from Baghdad to Bussorah overland via Hillah, Dewanieh, Semawa, and Suk-esh-Shiookh, is three hundred miles, but no post stations exist on the road, nor, under present circum stances, could relays of horses be easily procured. As stated by Dr. Hyslop, a mounted Arab messenger at present usually performs the journey in 8 days. I have the honour to be, &amp;c., (Signed) A. B. KEMBALL, Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. Baghdad, 1th May 1861. Memorandum to Lieutenant Colonel Kemball, C.B. SUBMARINE CABLE FROM KOWEIT TO KURRACHEE. I am of opinion the kind of cable best suited for this line, where there is no danger of damage from anchorage, would be one containing one No. 13£ copper wire, similar in size and weight to the one laid from the English coast to the Isle of Man, which has answered and worked well for a period of not less than two years; it weighs -tj tons per mile ; the outer covering of iron wires is protected with hemp fibre, satu- lated in Asphalte, nearly ± inch thick, so that it can never rust: this protection to the iron wires will be found to be great economy in the end, without which the best of cables are quickly destroyed by rust. The cost of this cable in England is about £1 l 0 per mile. I believe a cable of this description would answer every purpose ;wherever there is anchorage it would, of course, be necessary to secure and strengthen such a cable, in the manner adopted for the cable in use between the English coast and Holland. I may mention, by the way, that the cable in question (from England to Hol land) comprises 4 wires, is 9J tons in weight, and costs (in England) £350 per mile ; the core is covered with yarn, and secured with 10 No. 0, ungalvanized iron wires;—smaller sized iron wires and more of them would stand anchors better, but they want protection from rust like the Isle of Man cable. Assuming that more than one small cable will be eventually laid, I would suggest that for the shore ends, 4 or more of the single-wire cables be formed into a large cable, similar to the shore ends of the Holland cable; this precaution is necessary, to enable the cable to withstand the movement which always takes place at the landing places, and more particularly so where there is any rock. Great care should be taken in selecting landing places, for I have known several instances, where this has not been sufficiently regarded, that cables have been cut through, and ultimately have been obliged to be removed to more suitable landing places; this was of frequent occurrence in the case of the Channel Islands cable. If one single-wire cable is found not to be sufficient, I consider that two or three of these can be much more safely laid than one heavy cable, containing 3 or 4 wires, which, as above stated, w T ould weigh from 9 to 10 tons, and would cost £350 per mile: one single-wire cable will probably be considered sufficient until the land wires have been tested as to their security and safety. (Signed) II. C. GREENER.From J. M. Hyslop, Esquire, Officiating Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, To H. L. Anderson, Esquire, Chief Secretary to Government Bombay, Sir, Dated Baghdad, 10th April 1861. I have had the honor of receiving your Circular No. 72 of 1861, forwarding copy of a letter from the Reverend G. P. Badger on the subject of Telegraphic communication between India and England, and calling for my opinion on the subject discussed by him. 2. As the Honorable the Governor in Council is doubtless aware, Lieute nant Colonel Kemball is at present engaged in examining the line of Telegraph which has recently been constructed between Constantinople and Baghdad, and as he will report fully to Government on the completion of his survey, I will only offer a few remarks, suggested by Mr. Badger’s letter. 3. Although Baghdad is not yet in Telegraphic communication with Constantinople, owing to the want of Signallers on the lower portion of the line, and although the wire between Mosul and this has several times been cut, yet, as the line has been working satisfactorily from Mosul for five months, and as measures can without difficulty be taken for the preservation of the section between that town and Baghdad, w r e may assume as a fact the existence of continuous Telegraphic lines between London and Baghdad. 4. For the extension of the line from Baghdad to Bussorah, one of tw'o methods may be pursued—the aerial, or the subfluvial. In the former two routes mav be followed, one on the eastern bank of the Tigris to Koot-al-Amara, and from thence down the Shat-al-llye to Sook-esh-Shiukh, and from that to Bussorah, or - the mouth of the Shat-al-Arab, on the western bank of the Euphrates. Last year the construction of the line on this route w-as accomplished for a distance of about sixty miles from Baghdad, but consequent on orders from Constantinople the work was discontinued, and no means having been taken for the preservation of the wire, the half of it was soon destroyed. The other route from Baghdad is by way of Hillah, following the military road along the Euphrates. 5. Owing to the lawless nature of the tribes through which the line must f ass by either of these routes, its preservation will present such difficulties as will, believe, be insurmountable by the Turkish Government. It is possible that in our hands, and by liberally subsidizing the Chiefs through 'whose territories the line may be carried, it may be preserved, subject to occasional destruction when the tribes are in revolt or at war with each other, but the expenses wDiild be great, both in subsidies and for repairs. Supposing that the wire in a subfluvial cable can be properly isolated, I can conceive of no more favorable circumstances for its preservation than would exist in the bed of the Tigris. After being submerged, it would soon be imbedded in the soft mud at the bottom of the river, unexposed to injury from boats, and little liable to damage from anchors, as Native craft seldom anchor in the stream. Thus running little risk of injury from mechanical causes, and entirely unexposed to chemical action from without, as Mr. Badger states the Red Sea cable to be, there is no reason to suppose that this method would not be entirely successful.1 ♦ MM I [ 1 I *♦ J V 6. It lias been conjectured that in shallow parts of the river the heat might be so great as to destroy the gutta percha coating of the wire, and were the cable to be at all exposed this would inevitably be the case, but I believe there is little doubt but that the cable being laid during the low season at the beginning of winter, it would before the hot weather commences be perfectly covered by alluvium. Another objection which has been made to the use of a cable is, that in the event of its being injured it would be impossible to underrun it for the purpose of discovering and repairing the faulty portion. This is evidently supposing the cable to be deeply imbedded in the mud, but, as I have shown that the risks of injury -would be very few, I submit that this objection should have little weight. 7. The determination, however, whether an aerial or subfluvial line should be constructed on the Baghdad-Bussorah section will require much considera tion and calculation. 8. Mr. Badger is mistaken in supposing (paragraph 4) that a cable for the river is already on the spot: material for a land line exists, but no cable. 9. Should the difficulties of constructing or preserving a line between Baghdad and Bussorah by either of the above methods be considered insurmounta ble, there exists still another plan of carrying on the communication between Baghdad and Bushire, viz. by way of Teheran, as noticed in paragraph 12 of Mr. Badger’s Report. The construction of a line of Telegraph between Baghdad and Teheran has for some time been talked of, but Prince Alee Koolee Mirza, who is entrusted with the management of this business, advocates the carrying of aline from Teheran to Bushire, instead of to Bagdad, the former being the safer route. 10. I have little doubt that both these lines might be constructed and preserved without much difficulty, and, although the distance is very much great er than by the direct route via Bussorah, the alternative should not be lost sight of. 11. Regarding the proposal to carry a Telegraphic wire overland from Bushire to Kurrachee, I cannot venture to make any remarks, being unacquainted 'with the country. 12. Mr. Badger, in paragraph 18, is slightly in error in saying that “ Bagh dad” is within four days of Bussorah either by the River Steamer or by special k ’ Tatar;” that this might be is possible enough, if the special Tatar had relays of horses, but, as things exist at present, w^e consider the journey well made in eight days. ** 13. As there is not a single English signaller on the line, Mr. Badger’s suggestions contained in paragraphs 18, 19 and 20, cannot at present be carried out ; and should it be determined hereafter to make use of the already available portion of the line, at least two fast and efficient steamers, drawing little water,- should be stationed in this River. The steam vessel Comet, at present on the Station, is of little use where speed is required. I have the honor to be, &amp;c. British Residency, ) J. M.

RIGHT HONORABLE SIR, In continuation of our Despatch dated the 27th June last, No. 41, we do ourselves the honor of transmitting copies of further correspondence relative to the proposed line of Telegraph between India and England through Turkey, Persia, and Beloochistan. This cor respondence comprises— 1 st .—A letter from Major Henry Green, C.B., Political Agent at Khelat, dated the 27th March last. 2nd. A letter from the Reverend Mr. Badger, dated at Aden the 3rd June last. ord .—A further letter from Major Green, dated the 23rd of the same month. 2. We proceed briefly to notice the subject of these communi cations. In the first Major Green, while expressing his concurrence in the practicability of the scheme generally, points out a difficulty in con- - nection with the establishment of the Telegraphic line along the Mekran Coast, arising out of a claim advanced by the Khan of Khelat to the Port of Guadur, now in possession of the Sultan of Muscat, and suggests, as a means of overcoming this difficulty, the purchase of Guadur by the British Government, and its transference, under certain conditions, to the Khan of Khelat, 3. It is admitted by Major Gpeen that the Imam of Muscat was in possession of the country to the west of Guadur as far as Cape Jask in the middle of last century, at which time the Khan of Khelat conquered the country lying between Guadur and Kurrachee, It is also admitted by him that the Imams have been in undisturbed possession of Guadur itself for about the same period, that is to say for fully a century, and it would, therefore, seem that their title, whether valid or otherwise origi nally, derives a prescriptive sanction from mere lapse of time. 4. The question raised by Major Green being an important one, we requested the Reverend Mr. Badger, when proceeding to Muscat in the beginning of last May as temporary head of the Muscat-Zanzi- bar Commission, to make enquiries and report fully on the whole subject.1 5. We would now draw attention to Mr. Badger's Report, (form ing enclosure No. 2,) which is replete with valuable information regarding the entire coast between Bunder Abbas, Guadur, and Sonmeanee. 0. With reference to the delicate questions discussed in para graphs 2, 3, and 4 of this Report, as to the extent to which the Sultan of Muscat and the Beloochee Chiefs on the Coast may be entitled to enter into engagements with us, consistently with their obligations to the Persian Government, and again of how far it would be fair in us to seek concessions from the Shah in a territory which the Beloochees regard as their own, we are of opinion that it will be necessary for H. M.s Govern ment to recognise the status which Persia actually possesses, and that the only sound course to pursue is to deal directly with the Chiefs by permission of the Sovereign power. 7. This course, while compromising the rights of neither party, would enable us to conciliate both. Persia would take no alarm at a proposal which would involve a recognition of her actual position, and the object of which would merely be that of facilitating the working out in detail of a scheme to which, in principle, she had already given her consent: the Chiefs on the Coast, on the other hand, would be satisfied with being, in practice, brought into direct communication with us, and thus fully assured of the various benefits which will naturally arise to them out of the establishment of the proposed Telegraphic line, including a moderate fixed payment for the custody of Stations. 8. We have communicated these views to the Government of India, who we trust will procure from the Court of Persia, through H. M.s Minister at Teheran, the necessary permission for opening negotia tions directly with the Chiefs. Should, however, H. M.’s Government deem that this object may be more readily attained through His Excel lency the Persian Ambassador in London, you will doubtless take such ( steps as may be requisite. 9. Referring to the communication forming enclosure No. 3, we have to state that before leaving Sind in March last His Excellency the President had arranged that Major Green, on his way from Khelatto the Presidency in progress to England, would visit the Coast of Mekran as far as the dominion of the Khan extends along it. Major Green accord ingly proceeded in the Hugh Lindsay along the Coast, and we now enclose a copy of the Report, with a sketch map, submitted by him in obedience to his instructions.

I am directed to address you in continuation of former corres pondence relative to the proposed line of Telegraph between India and England through Turkey, Persia, and Beloochistan. 2 . In a letter on the subject addressed to this Government by the Rev. Mr. Badger on the 17th December 1800,* that gentleman remarked that Bunder Abbas and Minan were farmed from Persia by the Sultan of Muskat, whom the inhabitants on the coast of Mekran from Cape Jask to Pussem acknowledge as their lord. This letter having been for warded to Major Henry Green, C.B., Political Agent at Khelat, elicited the report dated the 27th March last, of which I am now directed to for ward a copy, and from which you will observe that Major Green advocates the purchase of the Port of Gwadur from the Sultan of Muskat, and its transference, under certain conditions, to the Khan of Khelat. 1 he Rev. Mr. Badger when proceeding in the beginning of last May to Muskat, as temporary head of the Muskat and Zanzibar Commission, was requested to make enquiries and report fully on the subject of Major Green’s letter. This he has accordingly done, and I am desired to for ward herewith a copy of the letter containing his observations, which is dated from Aden on the 3rd June last. 3. Before leaving Sindh in March last, His Excellency the Governor had arranged that Major Green on his way from Khclat to the Presiden cy in progress to England would visit, and report upon, the coast of Mekran as far as the dominion of the Khan extends along it. Major Green accordingly proceeded in the Hugh Lindsay along the coast, and 1 am now directed to transmit, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council, a copy of the Report, with a sketch map, submitted by him in obedience to his instructions. 4. With reference to the delicate question, alluded to by Mr. Badger, of the extent to which the Sultan of Muskat and tlic Beloochcc Chiefs on the Coast may be entitled to enter into engagements with us, consis tently with their obligations to the Persian Government, and again of how far it would be fair or politic in us to seek concessions from the Shah in a territory which the Beloochecs still regard as their own, I am direct ed to say that His Excellency the Governor in Council thinks that it will be necessary for us to recognize the status which Persia actually possesses, and that the only sound course to pursue in this and all similar relations/ • is to deal directly with the Chiefs by permission of the Sovereign Power, l his course, while compromising the rights of neither party, woidd enable us to conciliate both. Persia would take no alarm at a proposal which would involve a recognition of her actual position, and the object of which would merely be that of facilitating the working out in detail of a scheme to which she had already given her consent : the Chiefs on the coast, on the other hand, would be satisfied with being, in practice, brought into direct communication with us, and thus fully assured of the various benefits which will naturally arise to them out of the esta blishment of the proposed Telegraphic line, including a moderate fixed payment for custody of stations. His Excellency in Council, therefore, trust that the Government of India will procure from the Court of Persia, through Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, the necessary pei&gt; mission for opening negotiations directly with the Chiefs.

J Acting Secretary to Government. *r-TFrom Major HENRY GREEN, C.B., Political Agent, Khelat, To THE POLITICAL SUPERINTENDENT, Frontier Upper Sind. Camp Bagh, March c llth, 1861. Sir, —With reference to Circular letter No. 72 of 1861, from Mr. Secretary Forwarding copy of Letter from Revd. Mr. Badger on the subject of a Telegraphic communication between India and England vid Baghdad and Kurrachee. Anderson to my address, I have the honour to forward the following remarks. 2. The whole scheme of the Reverend Mr. Badger appears to me feasible and practicable, provided we have the active co-operation of the Turkish and Persian Governments. 3. I propose confining myself to paragraphs 14 and 16 of the Reverend Gentleman’s letter, as these principally refer to the territories of His Highness the Khan of Khelat. 4. NusseerKhan, the great-grandfather of the present Khan, about the middle of the last century took possession of the country lying between longitude 60 and 66°, and latitude 25 to 30°, known as Kekran. He fixed his boundary at Gaik, situated about 120 miles west of the town of Kedj, the capital of Mekran. The port of the latter city, and in fact of the whole province, is Gwadur, which, as welf as all other ports lying between it and Kurrachee, came into the possession of the Belooch Chief, who, after placing his governors in the towns which he had conquered, returned with his forces to Khelat. 5. The country to the west of Gwadur as far as Cape Jask appears in those days to have been in possession of Sultan Syud, the Imaum of Muscat, and soon after the return of Nusseer Khan to Khelat, the inhabitants rebelled against the authority of the Imaum and threw off his allegiance. On this he despatched messengers and presents to the Khelat Chief requesting his assistance. The reply of the latter was that he could not furnish him with troops, but that he would give him the loan of the port of Gwadur, where he might land his troops and collect his stores, and that he might keep possession of it until he had brought his rebellious subjects to submission. This offer was accepted, and, on the above condition, the port was temporarily made over to the officers of the Imaum. 6. Soon after the above occurrence, Nusseer Khan, the Belooch Chief died, and his country fell into a state of anarchy, which has more or less continued, andof which the heirs of the Imaum, Sultan Syud, have taken advantage, and retained possession of Gwadur. The successors of Nusseer Khan have never, however, given op their claim to the port, and during the reign of the late Khan Nusseer Khan, a force was despatched from Kedj, under the orders of the present Wuzzeer, Wullee Mahomed, for the purpose of regaining possession of it. This was during the year 1857, but the Khan dying about this time, the expedition was abandoned, when the duty on which it had been despatched w r as nearly accomplished. 7. Since my stay in Beloochistan, His Highness, the present Khan has frecpiently asked me to be allowed to direct his Goveinoi ol Kedj, 1 ukkcci Mahomed, to march against Gwadur and take possession; but I, being aware of the friendly alliance existing between the present Imaum and the Bntish Government, have always declined to give my sanction. It is not, however, to be expected that His Highness will give up his claim to the port. 8. I would therefore suggest, that to prevent delay in the event of the proposi tion of the Reverend Mr. Badger being carried out, and Gwadur in all probability becoming one of the principal stations on the coast, that negotiations be entered into by the British Government with the Imaum for the purchase of that port by the former ; and that, under certain conditions, it be made over to His Highness the Khan of Khelat. I believe a very small sum would effect this object, and that, having this coast-line under the control of an ally such as the Khan of Khelat, would be of the greatest advantage, whether for political reasons, or for that now under report. 9. Supposing the above arrangement to have been effected, I would suggest that Gwadur be made the principal station between Cape Jask and Kurrachee; the intermediate stations between Gwadur and the latter being Pisanee, Homara, and Sonmeanee : these are situated about 100 miles apart. From Sonmeanee to Kurra chee it does not exceed in a direct line 60 miles. 10. Having fixed upon the stations, it would become necessary, after setting up the wire, to make arrangements for its protection. To effect this I would recom mend that the Political Officer residing at Khelat be directed to proceed, accom panied by some confidential servant of his Highness, to the coast, and that the former be empowered in the name, and by permission of His Highness, to entertain a cer tain number of the men of the tribes located around the stations, for the purpose of forming a Police for the protection of the line. These men might be paid by the British Government, but through His Highness the Khan, in the shape of an extra subsidy to be given for this express purpose, and to be under the control of the Political Officer. 11. The above appears to me the most feasible plan of carrying out that part of the proposed scheme referring to the Coast of Mekran, and in carrying out which I see no difficulties.12. During the latter part of 18r&gt;9 and commencement of 18G0 1 visited, accompanied by Major Malcolm Green, in command of a troop of Sind Horse, the eastern provinces of Mekran, including the valley of Nal, Gressia, and Mushka. r l he lateness of the season and political reasons prevented our proceeding as far as Ked j and Gwadur, but we saw quite enough of the country and its inhabitants to show that, with common precaution, and with the assistance of His Highness the Khan, there would be no difficulty in proceeding to any part of the country of Mekran. 13. I there became acquainted personally with all the principal Chiefs of the country, many of the most influential returning with me to Khelat. The inhabitants were civil and respectful, and as soon as they became aware that we intended them no harm brought us abundance of provisions. The tribes inhabiting the coast are by no means of a turbulent or unruly nature, and with tact, judgment, and kindness, might be soon conciliated to act up to our wishes. 14. Should the above suggestions meet with the approval of Government, much of the detail of carrying them into effect must be left to the discretion and judgment of the Political Officer. 15. I wish particularly to show that, in my opinion, there are no difficulties to prevent the completion of Mr. Badger’s scheme as far as the coast of Mekran may be concerned ; and that the British Government may rely on the cordial assistance and co-operation of His Highness the Khan of Khelat. 16. Herewith are appended descriptions of the ports along the coast pro posed as stations taken from Masson’s “ Beloochistan,” and from such oral infor mation as I have been able to procure. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) HENRY GREEN, Major, Politicad Agent, Khelat. DESCRIPTION OF THE PORTS. Gwadur is situated on the coast of Mekran, in longitude 61° 20' and latitude 25°, in the territory of His Highness the Khan of Khelat. This port is the principal one between Bunder Abass and Kurrachee, and has a tolerable trade, exporting Wool, Ghee, &amp;c. from Mekran and Bunpoor, and importing British piece goods and other commodities which find their way to Kurman, in Persia, and even to Candahar via Kedj and Punjgoor. The town, which consists of about 600 houses, has a tolerable bazaar; there is also a Fort in a ruinous condition, and mounting one or two old guns.4 Pisanee is a small port situated about 120 miles to the eastward of Gwadur it consists of about 200 bouses. Homara is a small port and town situated about 00 miles eastvvaid of Pisanee, and contains from 3 to 400 houses; it lias a tolerable trade with the interioi , the country around is very barren. Sonmeanee, situated 120 miles to the eastward of Honiara, is the seaport of the Province of Lus Beyla, and was formerly a port of considerable consequence, but since the occupation of Kurrachee by the British it has much fallen off. I he custom tolls are taken by the Jam of Lus Beyla, a feudatory of the Khan of Khelat; it has a good-sized bazaar. (True copy) (Signed) W. L. M ERFAV E FHLR, Major, Political Superintendent on the Frontier l pper Sind.Zaooghur, YJth April 187?. My dear Merewethrr, I Lave just received yours of the 13th, and thank you very much for sanctioning the ■whole of the proceedings in the Murree business, and the expenditure. I will not of course, as I said before, do anything without sanction. I saw exactly as well as yourself how the Khan made much of the order to help Fakeer Mahomed of Kedj, but it must be remem- bered that it was as much for himself as us, since he always collects his revenue at this time and in this way. Then again my last evening’s telegram to you will have shown you what these rascals are doing in Seistan. I feel sure that it is one move. I have not yet got your official to stop the levy, but I will write off at once to Harrison about it. About Moolla Mahomed &amp; Co., when I first sanctioned their going to Beyla, I wrote to the Deputy Col lector of Sehwan to say they would go that way, but that was afterwards cancelled. I feel sure however that it will all come right, for had not these Sirdars seen some hope of our helping them, according to promise, they would have gone over to the first stray rascals from Seistan or elsewhere, and I think the ultimate result will be that they will be kept out of mischief as before. Without some hope of this kind, they would have been despe rate. Both Khan and us against them they could not stand. The Khan has replied to my letter of advice to him, and I enclose a copy. T don t think it would have been possible, without having something to give and pro mise to Moolla Mahomed, to have kept him away from the assembly of the Sirdars this season, which you see the Khan himself, in the letter I wrote for you to see, expected and anticipated. They feel in fact like others in these countries that a time for settlement of some kind has come. They know all that has been passing both in Seistan, Mekran and Affghanistan, and I fear that though we appreciate Moolla Mahomed, yet that the Khau hates him far more than he does the Jam and Nooroodeen ; this is natural, as he feels that he has injured him, and that the Koran is a witness against him. I have an impression however that it will all come right, we have only as yet shown the Khan that he must not dragoon it over his subjects, as he has been in the habit of doing, under the moral support which our presence has given him. I did not speak to the Khan even of any point except the mercenaries and the confiscated lands, and really in regard to both, some arrangement will have to be made. , It is warming up here too, but I want to settle this part which I have not before seen, and tuere are an awful lot of real lootoos here and there, fellow's up to anything, from Bha- wulpoor, &amp;c. Could you let me see the scale of pay and appointments of the Police for Shikaipoor. I feel sure that to give Mosun Shah and any Moonshees we might entertain low pay would only make matters worse. The people of his district are so rich that they bubo the Police right and left, and it is only by my quietly informing some of these Zemin dars what they laid themselves open to by these tricks, that I have got them to be active in police matters. I will explain the whole thing fully from first to last in one report as soon as I get to Jacobabad. To do so now would be premature, as I have yet to see other places. Believe me, Ever sincerely yours, R PHAYRE. P. S.— I wrote to Harrison to-day, and also to the Vakeel, that just for the present they should quicken the postal communication between Jacobabad and Khelat, as it is rather important now that those Affghan refugees are in Seistan. My letter would have leached them had it been quicker. It might do so even now. R. P.Jacobabad, list April 1872, My dear Merewether, Tliis Sirdar, Syud Mahomed Khan Populzye, has just passed on ; he says that he gave a petition about his arrears to the Lieutenant-Governor at Lahore, and that at first lie declined taking any pension until he received an answer from Government, but that the Lieutenant-Governor himself told him that by his receiving what the Government had ordered him to take, he did not relinquish his claim for arrears, and that he (the Lieute nant-Governor) would submit it to the Government of India. If therefore you should receive a reply to your own reference about him, kindly let me know, as I have promised to tell him the result of the effort you have made for him when ever a reply may come. He is a quiet gentlemanly sort of fellow, and as his place is not a mile from Quetta, where he really is a man of influence, he might be of use some day, and he declares he will do anything I tell him. Strange to say he too has a case with the Khan, and he showed me a letter from the Khan to the MeerShere Ali Khan, in reply to a letter written by the latter, begging him (Khodadad Khan) not to allow his people to be constantly filching away bits of Sirdar Mahomed Syud Khan’s property. This appears to be a mania at Khelat. There is not a Sirdar in the whole country, good, bad, or indifferent, who has not some grievance of this sort, and I was surprised when this man showed me his papers. The Khan’s letter was as usual evasive, saying he would write to the Naib of Shawl about it. Believe me, Ever your’s sincerely, R. PHAYRE.Jacobabad, 1st September 1870. My dear Merewether, Your demi-official of the 28th instant places my conduct as Political Superintendent on this Frontier in a light so completely at variance with what I feel it to have been, that 1 must ask you to allow me, in self-defence, to afford you full explanation on each point noted by you, particularly as in no single instance have I infringed your orders or the orders of Government; indeed, in acting as I have done, I have merely exercised the powers entrusted to me by Government as the successor of the late General Jacob, yourself, and Sir Henry Green. You say first in general terms that I have now acted in a manner towards the Khan, Captain Harrison, and yourself, that you can no longer allow. If you will kindly point out the instances in which I have done so, and specify facts, I have not the least doubt that I shall be able to afford you a satisfactory reply. I am not aware that I have taken exception to any one’s action but that of my subordinate, Captain Harrison, and therefore it is a matter of justice that I should be informed of the acts to which you refer. Secondly, you refer to the events of April and May 1800, and say that you then saw that I was going into the dangerous course of “ direct interference with the Khan,” and that you prohibited it, but that I have persisted in it; and you now desire me to follow implicitly the instructions of May 1800, on Khelat affairs, “ to act only with and for the Khan, and to consider no one else.” I must respectfully ask you, with reference to this sweeping charge, to point out one act of mine that has directly interfered with the Khan’s affairs. Practically I have helped the Khan in every way as ordered, but whilst doing so, I have not been deterred from representing to you, in the current correspondence of the day, my views as Political Super intendent upon passing events. Last December, in the exercise of my proper and legitimate powers as such, I drew up a history of Khelat for the previous ten years ; and this year when I found Captain Harrison representing everything in one point of view only, I, without addressing the Khan, or interfering with him in any way, wrote in defence of the policy set forth in the Government Govt. Reso : No. 1712, dated Resoluti( &gt; ns as per margin, and of British interests generally; 3rd July 1870 . thereby illustrating both sides of the Khelat question, as I 16th July 1870. , ' vas bound m duty and honor to do; and surely you cannot justly designate representations of the Political Superintend ent on this Frontier to his own Government as active interference with the Khan’s Go vernment of his subjects, and disrespect towards yourself, if so, I deprecate so extreme a construction being put upon them ; and if all that I have really written be considered and sifted, it will be seen that my sole object has been to take care that questions of national importance should be fully represented to Government, so as to enable them to arrive at a definite decision, in sight of both sides of the question. I submit that it would be unfair to Government to gain their decision upon matters of vital moment in any other way. The correspondence of the last six weeks affords, I submit, plain straightforward evidence that I had very good reasons for what I did. Evidence that cannot, allow me to say, be quashed by your stigmatising it, as wrongly interfering with the Khan and Captain Hanison, and disrespectful to yourself, a feeling which I never entertained for one moment.2 I can*prove from tlie records of my office that I have not in this, or any other matter, exceeded the authority, and freedom of representation exercised by my predecessors ; and I need scarcely say that without both, the Political Superintendent would be a cipher unable to control the tribes, or be responsible as the executive officer for the administra tion entrusted to him. You next say that you feel that I have been unfortunate in not taking Major gftacau- ley’s advice, and you imply that because I would not, he left the Frontier and Service. I hope you do not really mean what the inference deducible from that statement conveys, because if you do, I can give you a fully satisfactory repl) regaiding it. I will sav nothinsf more therefore on the subject at present, than to state that Major Macau- ley was not Assistant Political Superintendent when I arrived on the Frontier in LSG8, and that when he did arrive some months after, he assumed charge of the Assistant’s duties, as ordered by my predecessors, viz: the Treasury and General Accounts, Judicial and Police duties, in addition to those of his Military appointment. More than these he could not possibly do, as I have often represented to you, and more than these none of my predecessors—so far as I can learn—ever required of the Assistant Political feupeiin- tendent. But with regard to Khelat affairs, I took a broader and surer means of aiiiwng at , , , the truth, than the opinion of one man would have afforded. Political Superintendent s let- .1 , r ter No. 17^3, dated 6th Decern- My letter and report as per margin included the repoits ot her 1869, and accompanying t h e i ate General Jacob, Sir Bartle Fr ere, yourself, and Sir narrative of khelat attains lor T . . r ten years. 'Henry Green ; and added to them I had, the orders ot the Secretary of State for India and of the Indian Governments for ten years and.more, before me. With these you must acknowledge that I possessed information of far more value than any one individual would have given me, but besides this, the only mention I have ever seen of Major Macauley in Sir Henry Green’s reports as connected with Khelat affairs was in the following passage, which shows that Major Macauley was rather of in} opinion than otherwise. Sir Henry Green reports “ Affairs were at this stage, when I joined His Highness in “ November 1857. I cannot say that I formed a high opinion of His Highness. I had “ much conversation with Lieutenant Macauley, and requested His Highness to introduce mo to the rebel Chiefs. Lieutenant Macauley appears to think that they had no al- ‘ ternative but to have acted as they had done, that they were most respectful, and pointed “ out that none of them would have been safe, nor could the country even be quiet, if the young Khan were to retain such advisers as Gool Mahomed and Gungaram. You further say that in my narrative of December 18G9 T quoted from the records merely to support pre-couceived ideas. This I cannot admit. It was quite impossible foi me to quote all the reports in full, so, to guard against any such imputation as you have now brought forward for the second time, I wrote the following, which you will find at para. 3 of the narrative itself. «Public documents only will be quoted, so that if fuller information be required ' upon any point separately, it may be gathered from perusing the original of any of “ them,” You next say that I leant on Sandeman, instead of Macauley, in the matter of Khelat affairs. Believe me that I am not given to leaning on any man, and never having done so during my 31 year’s service, I certainly have no intention of beginning now. I should be utterly unfit for my present position were such iny tendency, and I can confidently appealto my acts, since I came to the Frontier, as showing that you have no cause for making such a statement. It i\as Regarding the Murtee and Boogtee affairs that I supported Captain Sandeman’s ilews, not only because my predecessor Sir Henry Green had done so, but because, as I explained to you long ago, that in a letter from the Government of India to the Commis sioner of the Deiajat, the Secretary of State for India, as Well as the Indian Government had approved ot the policy with reference to those tribes which he represented. It was therefoie in defeience, in the first instance, to the highest authorities of Government, and a&gt; the next, Giving to my own appreciation of Captain Sandeman’s system, after practically experiencing its value, that I advocated it. But, as regards Khelat, I differ in much from Captain Sandeman. With regard to that, I went to a better authority, my predecessor, Sir Henry Green, whose last report, pievious to his departure from the Frontier, dated 14th April 1SG8, contains the following passage on the subject of the refugee Sirdars. * * * “ 1 then wrote t0 His Highness the Khan, who was at Khelat, pointing out ' that these Chiefs had received severe and well-merited punishment at his hands, and suggesting that it would be for his benefit and for the well-being of the country, if they were forgiven and allowed to return to their homes. In due time I received a reply from His Highness, saying that ho placed everything in my hands, and that he would “ agree to any arrangement I might suggest,” * * * dliiis icport was one of the first documents placed in my hands on my arrival on the I rentier. It was adopted and highly approved of by the Local and Imperial Governments, and on that account, and that alone, became my guide in subsequent proceedings. I there fore now ask if from that time to this I have done more or less than advocate, as Sir Henry Green’s successor, “that it would be for the Khan’s benefit and the well-being of his “ country, if these Chiefs were forgiven and allowed to return to their homes.” Thus, it was not because / alone thought that the rebel Sirdars were to be encouraged, as you impute to me in your demi-official under reply, or that I leant on Captain Sandeman s opinion of Khelat affairs, but because my predecessor held that, view, endorsed by the approval of Government. V ' he11 you sa T tliat a11 the papers go before Government immediately, and that wdiat- “ver may follow will be of my causing, and that you have done all you could to prevent ill happening to any one, I can assure you that I am quite willing to let the facts that have recently come to light speak for themselves. In the feeling that I have simply done my duty as Pohtical Superintendent I can heartily hope with you that ill will happen to no one ; nay, on the contrary, I hope for good to all from the free discussion that has taken place, because no good can possibly come of an one-sided discussion of any matter, so entangled as the skeins of Khelat policy are. I hope however that as this demi-official correspond ence is solely connected with the official subjects under discussion, you will kindly allow it to be considered as official. Believe me, Your’s very sincerely. R. PHAYRE.Foreign Department, Political] From, C. tf. Aitctiison, Esquire, C. S. I., Secretary to the Government of India. To, W. Wedderburn, Esquire, Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Fort William, the iLith February 1871. Sir, No. fYa dated 4th Feby. 1871. With reference to the letter from this Office, No. 2123 P., dated 6th December 1870, I am directed by the Viceroy and Governor General in Coun cil to forward a copy of a letter from the Secretary to the Government of the Punjab, which contains a full report of the Conference lately held between the Lieutenant-Governor and the Commissioner in Sind, and to state that His Excellency in Council would be glad to be favoured with the views of the Bombay Government on the proposals therein made, viz ;— 1st. That the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee K..an should be placed, as regards the management of the Murree and Boogtee tribes, under the orders of the Polite al Superintendent of the Sind Frontier. 2nd. That in addition to the sums now spent in entertaining levies of the Mur ree and Boogtee tribes, a further sum of Rs. 32,040 be given for additional levies to be entertained and paid in the name of the Khan of Khelat by the Political Super intendent of Upper Sind. 2. His Excellency in Council is quite prepared to sanction the first proposal, but before agreeing to the second, he wishes the question to be carefully considered by the Bombay Government, and to be favoured with the opinion of His Excellency the Governor injCouncil as soon as may be convenient. 3. It appears to His Excellency in Council that this proposal is virtually a revival in another form of a subsidy to the Khan, in addition to the subsidy of Rupees 50,000 paid under the treaty of 1854. His Excellency in Council is unable to find in the correspond ence relating to the negotiation of the treaty, or in the papers relating to the extra subsidy granted in 1859 and subsequently stopped, anything to countenance the idea which appears to be entertained by the local authorities, and to have first found expression in Sir William Merewetlier’s letter of 11th September 1868, that the subsidy was intended as compensation to the Khan for the loss of revenue sustained by the tariff of 1854. On the contrary, it was given on condition of the faithful fulfilment by the Khan, year by year, of his treaty obligations, and among others, of his engaging “ to prevent all plundering or other outrage “ by his subjects within or near British territory, to protect the passage of Merchants to “ and fro between the British dominions and Affghanistan, whether by way of Sind, or by way of Sonmeanee or other seaports of Makran, and to permit no exactions to be made “ beyond an equitable duty to be fixed by the British Government and Meer Nusseer Khan, &amp;c. 1 he subsidy is liable to be suspended if in any year these conditions are not faithfully fulfilled. 4. It seems to be admitted that the Khan has failed to act up to his obligations, not wilfully, but because he lacks the power to fulfil them. To strengthen his hands andpreserve the peace of the frontier, the British Government already spend on local levies Us. 91,800 a year,* in addition * In Sind Rupees 4,950x 12 = Rupees 59,400 In Punjab. Imperial Revenue 7,920 Salt Contract ,..,7,200 Grazing Tax 17,280 32,400 Total Rupees...91,800 to the subsidy paid to the Khan. It is now proposed to increase this expenditure by Rupees 32,040, raising it to Rupees 1,23,840, or nearly 2| times the subsidy to Which it is additional. o. In the opinion of His Excellency in Council it is worthy of serious consideration, ■whether the additional expenditure now proposed should be made in the Khan’s name without a corresponding reduction in the amount of subsidy to be paid to him direct, o r if it be inexpedient to reduce the subsidy, whether the payment should not be made to the Chiefs and tribes directly in the name of the British Government. His Excellency in Council is anxious to do every thing that can reasonably be expected for the purpose of strengthening the hands of the Khan and enabling him to consolidate his authority, but he is unable to sanction any course which would impair the responsibility imposed on the Khan by treaty, or would countenance the notion that the subsidy is granted for any other purposes than those which the treaty sets forth. G. His Excellenc}’ - . in Council will come to no final decision on the question till he is in receipt of the deliberate views of the Bombay Government, after weigh ing the con siderations above set forth. While anxious to meet the reasonable wishes or expectations of the Khan, to support his dignity and strengthen his power, His Excellency in Council is of opinion that the question must be decided on broader grounds than such personal considerations. 7. \ou will perceive that no opinion has been offered by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab on the relations of the Khan with his nobles, as the Lieutenant-Governor did not consider himself to be sufficiently well-informed to be able to understand clearly the position of affairs. On this subject, as also on the possibility of extending the useful ness ol the Muksoodwah Canal in the interests of the tribes bordering on Sind, His Excel- lency in Council still awaits the views of the Bombay Government.

Dated Lai core, 4//i February 1871. lam directed by the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor to state for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy the results of a Conference held yesterday at Mittunkotebetween the Lieutenant-Governor and Sir William Merewetlier, Commissioner in Sind, iil accordance with the instructions conveyed in your letter No. 2124 P., dated the Gth of December 1870.. These instructions -were passed on a communication of the Government of Bombay, No. 249, dated IGth July last, submitting for consideration certain proposals of the Com missioner in Sind, contained in his letters No. 52 and No. 337, dated the 2Gth January and 17th June, and with reference to the question of the future management of the Mtirree and Boogtee tribes* and the position of the Khan of Khelat and his relations to his Sirdars, directed that the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab and the Commissioner in Sind having discussed these questions on the spot, should submit such proposals as might enable the Supreme Government to reconcile existing differences of opinion, and to decide on a strictly uniform line of policy for the Sind and Punjab Frontiers. 2. The Punjab officials who took part in this Conference, in addition to the Secreta ries to Government in the Civil and Military Departments, were Brigadier General Keyes, Commanding the Frontier h orce, Lieutenant-Colonel Graham, Officiating Commissioner of the Derajat, and Captain Sandeman, Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan. Sir ^ illiam Merewether and Colonel Phayre, Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind, represented Sind in the Conference. 3. His Excellency will not consider it desirable or necessary that a full narration should here be given of the series of events which have terminated in the present Conference : 'voluminous reports have from time to time been submitted to the Government of India* both through the Government of Bombay and that of the Punjab on the affairs of Ivhelat, the management of the frontier tribes, and the system to be adopted on the frontiers of the Punjab and Sind ; and it is needless to repeat in this place what has already been submitted to Government in full detail. 4. I he first point upon which any discussion was held was the advantage of placing the direction of frontier affairs, solar as the management of the Murree and Booo'tee tribes w as concerned, in the hands of one officer, so as to secure the carrying out of the same on the frontiers of the Punjab and Sind. As His Excellency is aware, hitherto the action of the authorities of this Province and of Sind has been altogether independent of each other. The direction of the relations of the British Government with the Khelat State has always been in the hands of the Sind authorities, and they, considering the Murree and Boogtee tribes as the subjects of the Khan, however turbulent and rebellious they may be, have alwajs attempted to control them through the influence of tlieir legitimate Chief. The 1 unjab oliiceis on the other hand, had no official relations whatever with Khelat, and theii only fiontiei policy for many years, as far as the Murrees and Boogtees were concerned, was to drive back their marauding parties and endeavour to obtain compensation for damage committed in Biitish territory through the Political Superintendent of Upper Sind. 5. It was only in ISG^, that the Deputy Commissioner of Dora Ghazee Khan entered into direct relations with these tribes, They had made in January 1SG7 a combined raid into Biitish territory, had attacked the Fort of Harand, burned several villages, and killed several Biitish subjects. Captain Sandeman, the Dejiuty Commissioner, applied to Sir Hcmy Gieeu, the then Political Superintendent of the Upper Sind Frontier, for compen sation, but that officer held the Khan of Khelat to be free from responsibility ; that the Murrees, although nominally subjects of the Khan, were virtually independent of his authoiity, and that he could not be expected to control them.r 0. The Deputy Commissioner of Dcra Ghazee Khan was thus compelled in self-defence to take action himself, and entering into direct engagements with the Chiefs of the tribes in question, and taking a certain number of them and their followers into the service of Government, he enlisted them on the side of order, and from that time to this the tribes have adhered faithfully to their engagements, and the peace of the Southern Punjab border has been preserved. 7. This policy, which as far as the Punjab border was concerned, proved eminently successful, was unsatisfactory from other than Punjab points of view. There was no unity of action between the Punjab and Sind; the engagements which bound the tribes to respect the Punjab territory had no force in Sind; while the tribes seemed to eonsidei that their peaceful behaviour in one direction gave them a certain right to plundci on a more extensive scale in another; and their depredations in Khelat terntory and in the plains of Cutchee down to the Sind Frontier diminished the revenues of the Khan of Khelat, weakened his authority, and so disturbed the trade-routes through the Dolan Pass, that*caravans and merchants were compelled to give up the use of the most convenient and direct road into British India. 8. Every year it became more evident that if the Belooch tribes were to be reduced to order, and the security to commerce through the Bolan Passes restored, united action from the direction of Sind and the Punjab was essential. No good result could be hoped while the tribes were treated at the same time on two different systems, or when, as was lately the case, a rebellious tribe was punished for its depredations by exclusion from Sind territory, while, in the Punjab, its Chiefs and their followers were in receipt of allow ances from Government,—allowances which could not be suddenly stopped, as the Sind offi cials desired, without endangering the peace of the border from Harrand to Kusmore. 9. The Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor and the Commissioner in Sind, in discus- sin^ the best means of securing united action on the frontier, and efficient control of the Belooch tribes, have unreservedly accepted as the basis for such discussion the treaty- engagements of the Khan of Khelat with the British Government, and the necessity to observe them so long as they have not been expressly modified or cancelled. The treaty of the 14th May 1854, under which the Khan receives an annual subsidy of Its. 50,000, engaging in return to protect the trade-routes through his territories, and levy reasonable and stipulated rates of toll on merchandize, has always been held to place on the Khan the obligation to prevent plundering and outrages on the part of the Murrees and Boogtc^s. These tribes, it is true, have given to the Khan a very doubtful allegiance, while he has wished to disown as subjects tribes, whose occupation was plunder, whose raids devastated his country, and whose depredations he was called upon to make good. But however doubtful the allegiance of the tribes, and however anxious the Khan might be to renounce them as subjects, it is certain that from the date of the treaty of 1854 the Murrees and Boogtees have invariably been assumed by the British Government to be the subjects of the Khan, who was, under the treaty, bound to keep them in order, if possible, and an extra subsidy was actually granted him for several years for this very purpose. To deal now with the tribes independently of the Khan, to make arrangements with them ignoring his authority, nominal though it may be, would be undoubtedly in opposition to the policy which has hitherto been maintained, and which has received the sanction of the Govern ment of India and of the Secretary of State. 10. I am desired to state, moreover, that the Lieutenant-Governor and the Commis sioner in Sind are entirely agreed as to the advantage to the British Government of effect ing arrangements with the frontier tribes through the Khan of Khelat. Even did treaty- engagements not influence the consideration of the question, it would still be the interestof the Government to strengthen in every way the Khan of Khelat; to teach him, by assistance and wise counsel, to look to the British Government as his best friend ; and to aid him to put down brigandage, and make the caravan-routes from Aff'ghanistan, pass ing his territory, secure. The Khan is represented by those Officers who have been close ly connected with him to be well affected to the Government, and to have endeavoured, though with indifferent success, to carry out faithfully his engagements. His power has not been equal to his good will, and the outrages of the Murrees and Boogtees, repressed on the British border, have continued without any interruption in Cutchee and along the caravan route. This is in duty a reason that, in any arrangement with the tribes, the name and authority of the Khan should be used, and the security and peace of the Khelat territory be considered, as well as the tranquillity of the British border. The Government has a direct interest in the security of the important roads which pass through Khelat terri tory, and their maintenance in the hands of a strong and well-disposed Chief. Unless the British Government continues its support to the Khan of Khelat, he will be unable to main tain his position, and the country will fall into a state of anarchy, the battle-ground of numerous petty Chiefs; and there will be no one across our border, whose friendship would be worth acceptance, or whose influence would suffice to keep open the most important Commercial and Military road on the North-Western Frontier. 11. Such being the views of the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor and Sir William Merewether, and which it is understood, are shared by the Government of India, it appear ed absolutely necessary that the management of frontier affairs in their relation to the Murree and Boogtee tribes should be in the hands of one officer only, who should consider the requirements of the Punjab, Sind, and Khelat together, and be able to maintain a consistent policy towards the frontier tribes. The experiment of independent action by the Political Superintendent of Upper Sind and the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan has been tried for several years, and though from one point of view, success ful, could hardly be pronounced so, when the question is considered in its entirety, and the interests of the Punjab, Sind, and Khelat assumed to be one and the same, which they undoubtedly are. 12. His Honor and the Commissioner in Sind accordingly propose that the whole direction cf the relations with the Murree and Boogtee tribes be placed in the hands of the Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier, and that the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan, qua the abovenamed tribes, be under the orders of the Political Super- intendent, and not under the orders of the Commissioner of the Derajat, who will be relieved of all responsibility, so far as our political relations with these tribes are concerned. It would appear evident that if the political control is placed in the hands of one officer only, the Political Superintendent at Jacobabad, from his standing in the service and experience, must be the officer selected. The Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan has managed the tribes in the interests of the tranquillity of the Punjab border with great ability and success, which is readily admitted by the Commissioner in Sind ; and although he is now prepared to be placed under the orders of the Political Superintendent, it is by no means desirable nor intended that the interference of the latter officer should extend to matters of petty detail. His control will be general, and only such as to secure a uniform and consistent policy of management. The acquiesences of both Colonel Phayre, the Political Superintendent, and Captain Sandeman, the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan, in the proposed arrangement, and their conviction that it will at once dispose of many of the difficulties which have given so much trouble and have formed the subject of so much correspondence, are in the opinion of His Honor and the Commissioner in Sind strong arguments in favor of its adoption.13. The arrangements agreed upon by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor and the Commissioner in Sind for the pacification of the Murrees and Boogtees, and securing the tranquillity of the border and of Khelat territory, are detailed in the letter oi Sir William Merewether dated 26th January 1870 to the Government of Bombay, and which was submitted for the consideration of His Excellency the Viceroy in letter INo. 249, dated the 16th July last, of the Government of Bombay. In these proposals of the Commissioner in Sind, the Lieutenant-Governor concurs, and, believing that they will have the desired and anticipated results, he would recommend them for sanction. These proposals are, in short, to take into pay certain of the Murree and Boogtee Chiefs, with their followers. ith the object of strengthening the Khan of Khelat, the service would be given and the allowances made in his name, but in order to secure the due payment of the sums, and to prevent dispute and difficulty, the actual disbursements would be made at Jacobabad by the Political Superintendent and the Khan of Khelat’s officers. The quotum allotted to the Punjab sections of the tribe would, in the same manner, be paid by the Deputy Com missioner of Dera Ghazee Khan. Tor the allowances thus given the tribes would be bound to maintain horsemen, to keep open communications, and to abstain from all plundering in the territories of the British Government or ot the Khan of Khelat. Should they m anj place or in any direction break this condition, and commit outrages, their whole allowances would be liable to stoppage. 14. The Lieutenant-Governor and the Commissioner in Sind consider that, without an arrangement such as that proposed, it is altogether vain to expect the tribes to remain quiet. The Strong administration within British territory may, with difficulty, and by the exercise of constant vigilance, preserve the peace of the border, but these wild tribes will then turn to other and easier fields of plunder, and inflict, in the Cutchee and the Bolan, upon British interests, injury as great, though less direct. By taking the tribes into pay, by giving them a direct interest in the preservation of order, can their pacification alone be expected. Plundering has been the profession ol these people so long, and peaceful occupations have been so long neglected, that it is unreasonable to expect them to abstain from plundering, unless some inducement, which they can understand, is offered them. 15. It would not be reasonable to insist upon the Khan of Khelat coercing the Murrees and Boogtees in consideration of the subsidy he receives, nor would it be of the slightest use to make such a demand. The subsidy does not more than cover the losses sustained by the Khan in the low tariff of charges levied under the treaty on goods taken through Khelat territoiy, and he is quite unable, without further aid from Governmentj to subsidize or reduce to order the frontier tribes. Satisfactory arrangements cannot be made without some expense; but this must fairly be borne by the British Government, and will be repaid in increased commerce and reduction of Military expenditure upon border expedition. The change is not altogether a new one, but is a resuscitation in another form and in a reduced amount of the subsidy granted the Khan for the purpose of keeping in order the turbulent tribes on the border, and the withdrawal of which, how ever just, appear to have had a very unfortunate result on the tranquillity of Khelat. 16. The amount asked for by Sir William Merewether in the letter above quoted was Rs. 43,320 per annum, which sum included Rs. 11,280 for the Punjab frontier. But no additional sanction for the Punjab is required, and the amount for which the sanc tion of the Government of India is asked is consequently only Rs. 32,040 for charges on the Sind frontier, including Cutchee and the Bolau Pass. 17. It is at the same time necessary to state that the present expenditure on the Punjab border in allowance to the border tribes,—Murrees, Boogtees, Khetrans and Haddi- an i s&gt; —amounts to about the same sum as is now asked for the Sind border, viz. Rs. 32,400;but the greater portion of this has been raised locally, and only Rs. 7,920 has been required annually from imperial funds. These local funds, it is believed, can continue to supply the money needed under the new arrangements, without any assistance from the Imperial Treasury. 18. The two local sources from whiclx the funds are drawn are, the salt contract, and the “ tirni,” or grazing tax. The former of these, previous to the arrangements of 1867, by which the hills were opened to trade, was ordinarily sold for Rs. 900, for a term of three years. The subject of the contract was the earth salt manufactured in the plains. When the hills were opened up, the contract sold for a term of three years for about Rs. 22,000, and the increase in the amount of the contract proceeds, which was solely due to the arrangements concluded with the tribes, and the payments made them, was expended by the Deputy Commissioner in maintaining the arrangements. Rs. 7,200 a year is expended from this source on the pay of troopers, the balance received being credited as miscellaneous revenue. It would be more regular and satisfactory were the total proceeds from the salt con tract credited to Government, and a grant of Rs. 7,200 a year made from imperial revenues to meet the cost of horsemen entertained ; and such an arrangement may appear to the Government of India preferable to that now in force. 19. From the grazing tax, which is variable in amount, but which may be expected in the future to average Rs. 18,000, a sum of Rs. 17,280 is paid for the service of /2 horse men. This tax was recently increased in the Dera Ghazee Khan District, with special refer ence to the arrangements now in question, and the increase sanctioned by the Government of India, —the actual disposition of the money being one of the questions deferred for the consideration of the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor during the present tour. 20. The amount, therefore, requiring the present sanction of the Government of India to complete the proposed arrangements, and leaving the greater portion of the Pun jab charges to be met, as at present, from local resources is Rs. 32,000, which the Lieute nant-Governor and the Commissioner in Sind earnestly trust His Excellency the \ iceroy may be pleased to sanction in the manner and for the objects proposed in the letter of the Commissioner in Sind, No. 52, dated 26th January 18/0. If this is done, and if His Lxm 1 lency in Council agrees to the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan being placed, in questions relating to the Murree and Boogtee tribes, under the orders of the Political Superintendent of Upper Sind, the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor and Sir William Merewether trust that the difficulties and dangers arising from 'divided authority and inconsistent policy will cease, and that quiet will be maintained both on the British border and in Khelat. It is moreover hoped that early intimation of sanction having been accord ed may be conveyed, as it is very desirable that arrangements should be made and Cutchee visited in company with the Khan of Khelat, who is new im Cutehee, but is not expected to remain there very long. / 21. In conclusion, I am directed to state that the Honorable the Lieutenant- Governor and the Commissioner of Sind, after full deliberation, have decided to submit to His Excellency no joint representation on the subject of the internal condition of the state of Khelat, and the relation of the Khan with his subordinate Chiefs and Sirdars. The Lieutenant-Governor and Sir William Merewether have felt that, in abstaining Irom any recommendations on this subject, they best follow the instructions of the Government of India, which only desired that their views and decisions should be recorded, where it would8 be possible to draw from them some practical conclusion. But this is impossible with re gard to the internal affairs of Khelat. The direction of the political relations of the State having rested entirely with the Sind authorities, under the orders of the Bombay Govern ment, the Government of the Punjab has never been in possession of information which could enable it to understand clearly the position of affairs. The Honorable the Lieutenant- Governor is consequently unwilling, on imperfect information, to commit himself to views which, were the whole circumstances of the case known to him, he might have occasion to modify or abandon. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., E. W. TROTTER, For Secretary to Government, Punjab. No. 3167 of 1371. Political Department. ^Foreign. To, The Secretary to the Government of India. Sir, I am directed by the Right Honorable the Governor in Council to acknowledge the re ceipt of your letter dated the 24th February last, No. 412 P., forwarding copy of a letter from the Secretary to the Government of the Punjab, containing a full report of the Con ference lately held between the Lieutenant-Governor and the Commissioner in Sind, in accordance with the instructions conveyed in your letter No. 2123 P., dated December 6th, 1870. 2. The Government of India have requested the opinion of this Government on two proposals made at the Conference regarding the management of the Murree and Boogtee tribes, viz: 1st—That the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan should be placed, as regards the management of the Murree and Boogtee tribes, under the orders of the Political Superintendent of the Sind Frontier. It is observed that His Excellency the Viceroy in Council is prepared to sanction this proposal, and I am directed to state that •Vide paras. 10 and 11 of Bom- the Ri g ht Honorable the Governor in Council entirely con- bay Government Resolution No. curs* as to the propriety of the proposed arrangement. 1712, of 3rd June 1870. • 3. The second proposal is, that in addition to the sums now spent in entertaining levies of the Murree and Boogtee tribes, a further sum of Rupees 32,040 be given for ad ditional levies to be entertained and paid in the name of the Khan of Khelat by the Poli tical Superintendent of Upper Sind. . 4. Besides the financial objections to so large an increase of expenditure, the Govern ment of India have noted several points for consideration, viz: (a) whether a corres ponding reduction should not be made in the Khan’s subsidy; (b) whether if the Khan’s subsidy be not reduced, it would not be expedient to pay the tribes directly in the name-ef the British Government; (c) whether the proposal may not impair the responsibility imposed on the Khan by treaty; and (d) whether it would not countenance the notion that the Khans subsidy is granted for any other purposes than those which the treaty sets forth. 5. After weighing the considerations noticed by the Government of India, His Ex cellency in Council is of opinion that the subsidy granted to the Khan under the treaty of 1854 should not be reduced. The ground for withholding the subsidy would be if the Khan had not (vide Article VII.) “ faithfully performed” the conditions of the treaty. But the local authorities report that he has done his best to keep these tribes in ordei*. The. task is beyond his power; and as he has apparently done all that he can reasonably be expect ed to do towards fulfilling the conditions of the treaty, it would hardly be fair to inflict upon him the penalty. It would also not be expedient to adopt a measure which would weaken his power for good, while it would no doubt tend to impair the friendly feeling which now exists. C. With regard to the point (b). His Excellency in Council has already expressed his opinion that the payments to these tribes, which have been hitherto regarded as Khelat subjects, should be made in the name of the Khan. The services for which they are en tertained are almost entirely to be performed in Khelat territory. And while, on the one hand, no special advantage to Government appears to be derivable from direct pay ments, on the other hand, the authority of the Khan will be consolidated, if these tribes are piactically taught to look to him as their lawful Sovereign. Direct payments would tend to reverse the policy, which has been acted on for many years, under which these tribes have been regarded as the Khan’s subjects. 7. His Excellency in Council does not anticipate any practical inconvenience on ac count of the matters noticed in points (c) and (d). But if necessary the Khan could be formally addressed on the subject, so that no possibility of future misapprehension should exist. 8. With reference however to the remarks contained in para. 3 of the letter now umler reply, to the effect that the local authorities appear to entertain the idea that the subsidy of Rs. 50,000 was intended as compensation to the Khan for loss of revenue sustained by the tariff of 1854, it is to be observed that in the report of the Conference (para. 9), it is distinctly recognized that the Khan is by treatv bound not only to reduce the tariff, but also to protect the trade-routes, and prevent plundering. The same principle is laid down in para. 46 of Sir William Merewether’s letter -No. 52, * Copy forwarded to the Go- ° f 26tl ‘ J “ m ' ary 1870 '* The local authorities do not vernment of India with Bom- apparently deny the liability of the Khan to prevent out- daLdtheTcth Juiyi^ra 0 ra o es - But they point out (vide para. 15 of the Conference report) that the subsidy does not more than cover the loss caused by the reduction in the tariff. So that the position of the Khan as to ability to control the tribes is not materially improved by the existing treaty. 9. With regard to the financial aspect of the case, this Government were disposed to think that a smaller outlay than that now proposed might have been sufficient, especial ly at the beginning. But as the matter has been fully discussed at the Conference by the Officers best acquainted with the details of the subject, His Excellency in Council will not propose that the amount should be reduced. The possible reduction of expenditure in future years should, however, not be lost sight of ; and the Political Agent at Khelat should report from time to time what measures have been taken to induce the Murrees and Boogtees to settle to peaceful occupations in Khelat territory.10 10.

If His Excel lency in Council decides that the disbursements to the Murree and Boogtee tribes can now be properly made, His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council hopes that the payments will be so arranged that on the one hand the British Government will not be committed to taking any part in the struggle now going on in Khelat; and on the other band that the money will not be used to assist any of the Khan’s subjects in their rebel lion. 2. I am to request that a general report on the question referred to in para. 3 of the Foreign Department Resolution of 19th October may be submitted within a year from this date. I have, &amp;c., C. U.

That the control of the relations of Government with those tribes should be placed in the hands of the Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier, and that the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan, in respect of the said tribes, should be placed under the Political Superintendent, and not under the Commissioner of the Derajat, who will be relieved of all responsibility so far as those relations are concerned, dhe Viceroy and Governor General in Council entirely approves ot this proposal, and authorizes its being carried into effect. 2nd. It was proposed to grant an additional sum of Rs. 32,040 for the entertainment of certain horsemen of the Murree and Boogtee tribes for purposes of protection. As to the mode of paying this amount, three distinct proposal#have been made : (a) that it should be paid to the Khan of Khelat: (b) that if additional sums are considered neces sary for preserving the peace of the frontier, they should be paid to the Chiefs in the name of the British Government: and (c) that the amount should be handed over to the Chiefs in the name of the Khan, and that it should be considered an addition to the subsidy of Rs. 50,000 a year at present paid to the Khan. The last course is that which commends itself to His Excellency in Council, and it will accordingly be recommended to the Finan cial Department for sanction. 3. But looking to the large sums that are yearly paid for securing the peace of the frontier, and for the protection of trade, and to the small results obtained for this outlay, His Excellency in Council is clearly of opinion that for the present this additional amount of Rs. 32,040 shall only be granted for one year, and on the distinct understanding that the whole question, connected as it is with the administration of the Sind and Punjab frontier, may be taken up shortly and discussed in ail its bearings. 4 As regards the relations of the Khan of Khelat with his nobles, the Governor General in Council concurs generally in the views expressed by His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in his Minute dated the 10th February last, paras. 8 to 29. The Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier, and the Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazee Khan should shape their attitude to the subjects of the Khan accordingly. As regards the petition of Moola Mahomed, His Excellency in Council considers that after a lapse of this interval of time it is not needtul to make any communication rejrardincr it to the Ameer of Cabul.
