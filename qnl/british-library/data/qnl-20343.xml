The present sr^all garrison at Kaf is presumably only intended- to show the fla,*;-and to repel minor raids by irresponsible elements. I understand fro i th' enclosure to your despatch confidential of July 26th that if a serious wahabi attack materialises in spite of our message to Bin Saud iibdullah will be unable with th small force now at Kaf to resist it without some assistance from us. The position in this respect reiaanis as stated in ray telegram Ko.214 of June Oth, namely that w ii 1 e i..I.aOvt. are ready to use their influence to restrain Bin Saud by diplomatic means from attacking Kaf, Abdullah can in no circumstances re 1 y on either military or financial support in its defence. This bein^ so, it is most und.sirable that matters should reach such a pitch that the small reserve force detachment is in real danger of bein^ overwhelmed. Can Abdullah rely on sufficiently early information of impending serious attack to enable him to withdraw the garrison intact?. If not, it appears that he would be well advise to withdraw it now, leavind 'I. .iovt. to restore final relations by exercise of financial or other pressure on thu Sultan.

The sense of your telerrram/has been communicated to Abdullah. The garrison is still at Kaf, but there should be ample warning of any serious advance from Jauf in time to permit of withdrawal. There is so far' no news of any considerable force arriving at Jauf. If Feisal launched the Iraq tribes against ^ejd, in the event of Kaf being captured by Ibn Saud, general hostilities would ensue and we should be involved if the V.ahabis pushed their advance to Azrak and thus threatened the air route. Strong representations to Ibn Saud therefore seem urgent, and I venture to agree generally with the view expressed by Knox in telegram No.73^ of August 29th. I consider the results of any meeting between Feisal and Ibn Salid would ba more promising if Abdullah should also be present. Highcoma.61/10. Telegram r. From Colonial Office.

Dated ^rd received 4th 'September 192?* r r ■ I understand that the reasons why Abdullah with Philby's acquiescence as^ed Feisal to represent Trans-Jordania were, , (1) Tl^at (one group mutilated) and political conditions naVe a meeting between Feisal and Ion Saud easy, especially a^ such a meeting has long been cont emplated. (2) Feisal's relationship and recent intimate discussions with Abdullah. (2) Feisal* s thorough knowledge of the whole of the Jauf locality and tribes, obtained during his operations against the Turks. It is, I think, natural that they should both feel t lat the Trans-Jordan case could be put forward with more force by Feisal than by anyone possessing, less personal knowledge of the actors involved. Ag to riedjaz, I understand t lat : 1 eisal nas been in telegraphic communication with Hussein aooul possible negotiations by the former with Ibn Saud, but Hussein has not yet sent a final reply. I quite appreciate the possibility that Xbn Saud might refuse to meet Feisal as representative of Irans-Jordan!a, and such refusal would do no harm. I fear o. ever that if we refuse without very convincing reasons to # allow the suggestion of a meeting to be pub to l' n oaud all sorts of motives will be read into our refusal oy by Feisal, who has set his heart or, being allowed to try, and will become bitterly disappointed suspicious and unfriendly at a moment whfen complete collaooration between him and myself here is essential -tor titpur-pose of getting through agreements subsidiary to the treaty. From 'ny local point of view therefore 1 would urge H.x.. .aovt. to allow the suggestion of the meeting to be put to Ibn • 0 . Saud without any show of desire for its • * ♦ acceptance. 'iss Bell who has jus? arrived via (01 e group rauti&amp;ited) tells me that Abdullah anfi Philby art definitely under the impression ^ that the meeting (one group mutilated) in any case takes place, and that I'rans-Jordan questions * can # be conveniently discussed there.

The following general policy of H.M. Govern- -ment is communicated foi your guidance and should be adhered to subject to comment to Baghdad or Jerusalem, which should be repeated to me. It should be kept strict- -ly secret. The frontier of Trans-Jordania being the frontier of the mandated area of Palestine, is the direct concern of H.M: Government. They are prepared to exclude the whole of Wadi Sarhan from Kaf inclusive, and to allow Hedjaz to extend Northward along the railway as far as Mudawwara, provided that Trans-Jordania has access to the Gulf of Akaba, that Ilejd does not encroach upon the Hedjaz railway, and that Xhurraa and Taraba are included in Hedjaz. They would accordingly see no objection to the frontier being drawn from the intersection of meridian 39 with parallel 32 to the intersection of meridian 37 with parall el 3li. Thence along meridian 37 to parallel 31. Thence to the intersection of the merician 56 with parallel 30. Thence along meridian 38 to parallel 29 degrees 3b, or point due west of Hefud salient. Thence crossing the Hedjaz railway in the neighbourhood of Mudawwara to point on the Gulf Sou^h of Akaba. For practical purposes the lineline as ultimately delimited will no dobbt follow the natural features, but the above gives the general direct- -ion. Abdulla would thus give up Kaf for Akaba. Bin Baud would give up Khurma and Taraba for Kaf, and Hussein would give up any claim to territory North of Mudawwara for Khurma and Taraba. -ou should leave the plenipotentiaries to open ^he discussion themselves. Kach party will no doubt commence operations by making exoreme demands, but I trust you may be able to gmide them to the above conclusion. I t the event of Hedjaz hot being represented, H.M. GOVT, will not discuss the Trans-Jordan boundary beyond the Nefud salient, which is the point at which they consider that the Nejd-Hedjaz boundary should take off. The cession of Kaf must in this case be conditional upon a written undertaking from Bin baud agreeing to the subseq- -uent inclusion of Khurma and Tarab in fiedjaz, if so desired by H.M.Government. The above should be communicated to Colonel Knox. DliVOUSHIRE.Telegrajn 1 rom To leiJeated P. Secretary of State for the Colonies.

His Hajesty's Government are unwilling to bring pressure to bear on Ali in the present uncertainty as to his future and that of Hejaz. In any case they are not prepared, as at present advised, to sanction any attempt to include T-3UK: in .'rans-Jordan. Question of including the town of AKABA is one for negotiation, though it seems scarcely practicably to proceeci with the matter until the situation in Hejaz has become more stable. In the meantime, warning to Ibn I. aud conveyed in my telegram j of the Ibth October, repeated to you under l .o. 297', in- 6 / ^/ -eluded the town within the area on which Wahhabis must not encroach. his warning was considered necessary as a precautionary measure ,with a view to averting Vahhabi aggression from Palestine. It was not intended to lay down definite frontier merely to warn off ahhabis.

Telegram From To Repeated PRIORITY . Your telegram of 16th January I am not clear why Feisal should feeled called upon to give advice to the Chief of RUWALLAL Trifile, whose headquarters are, I understand, in French Mandated Territory. In any case it is not a matter in which His Majesty's Govern- -ment could undertake to advise him. He is doubtless aware of the general attitude adopted by His Majesty's Govern- -ment. We have indicated clearly the line beyond which Ibn Saud cannot advance without coming into conflict with ourselves and we have warned Ibn Saud that if his forces cross this li^e steps will be taken to expel them. That is sufficient indication of His Majesty's Government's attitude towards any attempt by the Sultan to extend his influence on the lines contemplated in your telegram. We must be pre pared, if the contingency arises, to make good our warning to Ibn Saud. I should be glad if you would consider and report, after consultation with the Air Officer Commanding , what defensive measures could be taken in that event to assist tribes in repelling attacks. The Government of Iraq should clearly understand that this is the settled policy of His Majesty's Government, to confine themselves in any event to defensive action. They are determined not to be drawn into active hostilities in Nejd territory. Meanwhile they do not consider necessary or desirable to take jip the question of co-operation with France. They are doubtful whether such co-operation would be practicable in any event.

In continuation of my telegram No. 55, dated the 25th November 1924, I have the honour to enclose a translation of letter No. Ill, dated the 8th November 1924, from His Highness the Sultan of Nejd on the subject of the unsettled boundary between Nejd and Trans-Jordan. Your message of the 15th October, No. 416, was received by me in Bahrain and was handed to the Political Agent at once for transmission. On the 20th October from Bushire I communicated to Major Daly the detailed description of the Provisional boundary in a telegram No. 1046, of which I attach a paraphrase. This was forwarded to Ibn Saud on the 21st October. It is obviously the receipt of this letter which His Highness acknowledges in his letter No. Ill now received. Copies of this despatch are being sent to Their Excellencies the High Commissioners for Iraq and Palestine and to the Government of India. Telegram P., from the Political Resident, Bushire, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, No . 1046,' dated the 20 th October 1924. Please communicate the following as accurately as possible in a letter to Ibn Saud. Provisional boundary of Trans-Jordania referred to in telegram from His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated October 15th, is as follows:— The intersection of meridian 39 with parallel 32 to the intersection of meridian 37 with parallel 31-|. Thence along meridian 37 to parallel 31. Thence to the intersection of meridian 38 with parallel 30. Thence along meridian 38 to parallel 29 degrees 35 or point due west of Nefud salient. Thence crossing the Hedjaz railway in the neighbourhood of Mudawwara to point on the Gulf south of Akaba. Ends. In other words, boundary stretches from Gulf of Akaba at point due West of Mudawwara through Mudawwara and Jebel Tubik up to. Meridian 38, 32 miles below intersectiqn of Meridian 38 with parallel 30. Thence North West about 95 miles to Wakf-As-Suan, thence North about 40 miles, thence 120 miles East and slightly North to intersection of meridian 39 with parallel 32, thus forming tri-junction with Iraq. ///A- '■) l' - y*.Letter No .

After Compliments. I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter (of October 21st), which supplements the telegram received from the Secretary^ of State for the Colonies regarding the Eastern boundary of 1 rans-Jordania, and I request you to kindly convey the following to His Britannic Majesty s Go\ernment. The telegram sent to Colonel Knox on the 8th November has not reached me and I have no knowledge of it; nor was it discussed in the Kuwait Con ference. So long as the boundary question is between the Government of Neid and His Britannic Majesty's Government, its solution is easy and a settlement thereof is possible by private negotiations carried out between the Neid Government and His Britannic Majesty's Government. I am prepared to commence negotiations on this question at the time and in the place which the British Government thinks fit for this purpose. This is what had to be said and may you be preserved.

Kis Majesty's Government have been informed .that ' Hig Higlriness the Sultan of Nejd has despatched a force to attack AKABA. They understand that his reason for taking this step is his conviction that Your I-lajesty and the Hejaz Government are engaged both at UAAII and at AKABA in activities | against him. As Your l ajesty is aware, His Llajesty f s Government have alvi/ays regarded the territory of Trans-Jordania, for which they are responsible under the Mandate of Palestine, { as including IIAAIT and having access to the sea in the neighbour- -hood of AKARA. When Your liajesty took refuge there they informed King Ali and Emir Abdullah of this and invited them to open negotiations for the delimitation of the frontier between ^rans-Jordania and Hejaz. It was not, however, found possible to conduct negotiations in the unsettled state of affairs in Hejaz, and so long as it appeared unlikely that hostilities would extend to the neighbourhood of Trans-Jordania His I^jesty's Government were prepared to leave the question for future settlement. % But matters have now reached a ^ point where His Hajesty/s Government can no longer permit the present undefined state of affairs to continue. They are accordingly/ij. accordingly tak^ing steps to establish the authority of the Trans-Jordanian Administration in the area for which they regard themselves as responsible to the League of ITations. This area includes both l-HAAN and AKABA, and they have no alternative but to invite Your Majesty to leave it before your presence there leads to difficulties betv/een themselves and 1 the Sultan of-lTejd. In the event of a Wahhabi attack they may find themselves compelled to insist on your immediate departure and they cannot in any case contemplate your remaining at AJvABA for more than three weeks.

Your Highness will recollect that this town lies within the boundary within which you were informed in October last ihat any unprovoked aggression on Your Higb- -ness* part should be regarded as an attack upon territory for which His lajesty^s Government are responsible. His r.ajesty f s Government cannot allow Akhwan forces to violate the frontier laid down, and if an Akhwan force attempts to enter .Akaba His IlaJ®sty's Government will inevitably be Compelled to take such steps as are necessary to prevent or eject them. His Hajesty's Government fully realise that Your Highness would have a legitimate cause of complaint were this the territory within boundary to be used as a base for HeJaz operations against Hejd. They understand that Your Highness believes this to be the case, and they realize that the continued presence of e::-Eing Husain at Akaba lends colout to this view. They have therefore decided to invite him to proceed elsewhere. At the same time they areare taking steps to establish the authority of the Trans- ordamian Adrninistration in the whole area v/ithin the % boundary communicated to you in October last. This will remove all possible danger of the territory under their mandate being used as a base for operations against Your highness. They are ready and anxious to consult you with a view to the actual delimitation of the frontier between l T eJd and Trans-Jordania as well as the settlement of ail outstanding/ questions between yourself and Trans- -.Tordamia and Iraq, and are willing to initiate immediate 2'ego ia-ions v.'itl 1 Your Highness or with an accredited repres- -entative, either in London or elsewhere.

If you concur, I suggest that ALI might be urged to issue these instructions without delay.

CAPTAIK w. asked the iieoretary of atata for the Colon!ea whether he liae recently defined the aoutiiern and eastern boundaries of Transjordania; and, if so, by what authority? Mr. AMHJRY: On the 23rd September, 1922, the League of Nations approved a definition of Xransjordan as terri tory lying to the east of a line drawn from a point two miles west of the town of Akaba up the centre of the Wady Araba, Dead Sea and River Jordan to its junction with the River Yarmuk; and thence up the centre of that river to the Syrian frontier. It is clear from this definition that Transjordan territory was recognised at that time as extending as far south as the town of Alcaba. The actual frontiers between Transjordan and the independent Arabian territories of He^jas and Hejd have never been precisely defined although His llegesty^ Government have at various times invited the Sultan of Nejd and the King of the Hedjaz to agree with them in defining these boundaries. It has more than once been made clear to both parties by His Majesty 1 s Government that they regard the correct frontier as crossing the Hedjas Railway at some point between Ma 1 an and Tebuk and as giving Transjordan access to the sea in the neighbourhood of Akaba. It is true that for some time they acquiesced in the status of the Ma'an and Akaba dis tricts remaining indeterminate pending a final delimitation of the frontier, but when King Hussein constituted the ^*8^1 vilayet a vilayet of the Hedjas they foxmally protested, and when it appeared that these districts were being used by the Hedja* authorities as a recruiting ground, and also for the transport of war material, they considered it their dutyduty, in pursuance of their policy of neutrality, to take steps to estaolish the control of the Transjordan adminis tration In the area for which they regard themselre# as responsible under the mandate. The ex-King of the Hedjas, who had been allowed to take refuge at Akaba, was aooord- in i- 1 y^ : i^ La.ive, and has been aoooiiueodated at Cyprus, as I have already Infonaed the House. Steps are now being taken to establish the authority of the jsimlr Abdullah up to the line which His Majesty's Ooyernment ha,ye always regarded as being the correct boundary of the area under the Mandate for Palestine. The Sultan ol ^ejd has at the same time been once more inrited to co-operate with His Liajesty's Goyernment in defining that portion of the frontier which lies between Kejd and Trane- jordan, but it is clear that so long as hostilitiee continue between liejd and the Hed^az it will be difficult to arriye 3t a linal delimitation of their reapectiye frontiers with that territory, or to communicate the result to the League of Kations^ Oth July. 192b.(Hllo /f3 No. o &gt;1 ■HiRE RESIDENCY. \ Re?.

I AM directed by His Britannic Majesty's Government to inform your Highness that on the 17th January last a raiding party composed of about 450 Bedouin of your Highness's subjects raided the Hajaya-Mannain Arabs encamped between Bayer and El Hisa in Transjordanian territory. There were casualties on both sides, and a number of animals were looted. The raiding party was distributed under four standards. Sheikhs (1) Ikreyim- bin-Saud Ateya, (2) Enad-bin-Saud Ijmain, (3) Ahmed-bin-Saud Farhan, and (4) Sayyah-bin-Saud Mutain. The last-named belongs to the Aneiza, and the remainder to Bani Atiyeh. The raiders' intentions were to attack the Bani Sakhr tribesmen, and it is reported that while the Wahabi Governor of Hail endeavoured to prevent the raiders carrying out their projects, the Governor of Jauf encouraged the raid. The tribesmen in Transjordania are apprehensive of further raids, and I am to request your Highness to take steps to punish these raiders immediately, thereby discouraging this objectionable practice in the future. (Compliments.) Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Translation of Letter from the Hejaz Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Acting British Agent and Consul, Jeddah. No. 90, dated IQth Sha'ban, 1344 (March 3, 1926). (After respects.) HIS Majesty my Lord the King has ordered me to inform you that he has received your letter No. 141 of the 26th February, 1926, regarding the raids against the Transjordanian tribes. We do not know the names mentioned in your letter, and who were said to have made the attacks against the Transjordanian tribes. Therefore we are in doubt about the correctness of the news related about those accidents. The Amir of Hail, Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, wrote to His Majesty on 25-6-44 to say that Daghah Abu Tayah and Nawaf-el-Awagi their neighbour of Eniza have raided a party of Shararat near El Hawga and captured three of their camels and killed their owners. They again attacked Karim-bin-Ateya and captured some of his camels. Then Karim-bin-Ateya followed them to take back his camels. We have received no further news about him until now. Ends. To-day we received a telegram from the Amir of El Ula, and we enclose a copy for your perusal, and from which you will know the fact. Nothing has happened besides this. [1228 ft—4]As to the accusation against the Amir of El Jauf, it is not correct at all, because the mentioned man has no connection with those people, and their reference is the Amir of Hail. The actions made by the Transjordanian tribes against our tribes should not be overlooked. The Government of Transjordania wished by such complaint to hide the bad actions of its tribes. Now we cannot keep silent in respect of such actions and would rather pressingly request the matter to be considered, the things looted to be returned to their owners, and the transgressors to be punished in compliance with the Hadda agreement.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 26 of the 5th instant concerning the raids into Transjordania, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a further communication received from Ibn Saud on this question. 2. His Majesty has on several occasions recently expressed an opinion that the raids conducted from Transjordan are deliberately inspired to create trouble between Great Britain and Nejd, and he requests that immediate action may be taken to prevent further regrettable occurrences, otherwise it will be impossible for him to restrain the tribes under his care from taking retaliatory measures. 3. A copy of this despatch is being sent to Jerusalem. I have, &lt;fec. S. R. JORDAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Translation of Letter from Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Rahman-al-Faisal-al-Saud to the Acting British Agent and Consul, Jeddah, No. 112, dated 23r^ Sha'ban, 1344 {March 8, 1926). (After respects.) I HAVE written to you about the raids made by the tribes of Transjordania, and I have sent you the telegram received from our Amir at El Ula. We have to-day received another telegram confirming the occurrence of the previous raids and mentioning some other incidents that occurred by those tribes. You will find the details in the attached telegram. Such incidents have occurred in such a dreadful manner that indicates that there are some people working from behind administering these operations and pushing the mentioned tribes to make the attacks. I am afraid that such incidents may provoke our tribes, who will then take revenge against those who attacked them, and consequently the security at the frontiers will be affected which we are afraid of. Therefore, I most pressingly request that the transgressors should be punished and the looted properties returned to their owners. Otherwise I cannot bear the responsibility of any incident that may occur, and you know the nature of the Arabs. (With respects.) Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

The Honourable. Th« Chief '.iBoretury for paloetino, uoTomaont Officos, JonualiB. Sir* lirtAa Tritnmirti 1 hare the honour to aubmit herewith the Miiutes of the eittii^ji of the Hadda Tribunal and to report ae foilowe;- 1, The Tribunal mot on 4th February, 1927, and that and the folloviqb day were oooupied by a disoueeioa ae to whether the Tribunal should consider only olaias arising out of raids which took place since the date of the Hadda Afareemont, or whether sorae earlier, and, if eo, what date ehould be taken as the starting point. The Trans-Jordan delegates ir^uod that only raids since the date of the Hadda Agreement should be considered, while the Hejd delegates proposed either Hanadan 1343 or the date of the oooupation of Jauf (July 1921) as the startinb point. It was obvious that eaoh side wished to select the date which it beliered likely to result most utranta^eously to itself. In ay opinion the Hadda Agreement, though nothii^, definite is said on the point, oonteiaplated that the Tribunal would be set up to deal with future raids only, but 1 was anxious to obtain, if possible, an agreed decision, and acoordir^ly the TribunalTribunal adjourned until the 8th February, '»hen tb» Trana-Jordan dala^ate* announMd that thsy had been authorised to agree to the oooupation of Jauf (July 1921) aa the atartinti point. 2. The next question that arose was aa to vhioh claims this Tribunal should consider, the Nejd delegatea arming that only their claius as from Ramadan 1343, of which partioulirs were before the Tribunal, should be dealt with, lesoriife earlier claims to be dealt with by some other Tribunal. As the adoption of this course raitJit have resulted in there beinb an award made %ainat certain tribee on the one aide or the other, who had apparently valid oounter-clairas the oonsidera» tion of which would be perhaps indefinitely postponed, 1 euggeeted that the difficulty might be met by poatponint, the actual execution of the award until all claims had been considered. The Nejd delegates said that they must take the instructions of their ucrernasnt upon this, but took up the position that their authority was only to present the claims made by Nejd tribee and hare them adjudicated upon, but that they were not uxthoriaed to receive or consider any claims by Trana^Jordan tribes. After eome discussion it waa s^jreed that the Mejd delegates ataould ausk for (1) instructions as to the postponement of execution and (2) authority to receive and consider the claims of the Trana-Jordan tribee. 3. The Tribunal then proceeded to consider what method of proof of claims or disproof of liability should be adopted. Sabri el Assali, one of the Nejd delegates, said that he waa prepared to auggeat three poeaible methoda but that hie instructions were to auggeatsurest tho first and only to roroal the aeoond if tho first won rojeoteU. I only mention this proposal, whioh soetas like ens propounded to some character in a tale from the Thousand and One Nights, bsesuss it is so typical of the attitude of thie gentleman, who was the spokesman of the Hejd delegates. .»&gt;entuaiiy it was agreed that only the Sheikh of the trioe alletjud to hanre been responsible for each raid should be suamoned and put upon oath as to whsther the claim was true in whole or in part* hie denial upon oath beinb aooepted as eenslueiTe. The TribunAl then adjourned. 4. The Tribunal net a^ain on the 17th February when the Hejd deleyatee stated that they were willing to reeeiwe a copy of the olaia of the Trans-Jordan tribes but without prejudice until a copy had been eerred on their uoTomaenfe and its instructions receired. The Trans-Jordan delegates objected that they had been authorised to consider claims from both aides out that they could not atjree to be msrabors of a Tribunal which was to deal only with elaime a^unat Trans -Jordan tribes. At ths meetinb of the 22nd February the Hejd dele^atee stated that they had rooeired instructions wnidi were not clear and tho Tribunal a^ain adjourned in order that they mitht ask whether they were at liberty to accept claims earlier than Ramadan 1343 and also to consider claims made by Trans-Jordan tribes before these had been officially notified to their GoTemaent. 5. The Tribunal met a^ain on the 23rd 'arch when the Hejd delegates stated that their uoremraent had agreeda^jrood thai tha olaizoa of both uoTornuents should be •ubmittod to the Tribunal, consideration of those arising eat of raids whioh took plaee between the occupation of Jauf and Ramadan 1343 bein^ postponed until the necessary particulars had been prepared. They further stated that they were authorised to consider the clalius of Trans-Jordan tribes srisii^ out of raids since Ramadan 1343, but asked for a oopy of aueh claims so that thsy could study it and obtain instructions from their Govern- raent. 6. At the nsetinb of the 24th ! arch the Tribunal went through the Hejd olaims since Ramadan 1343 particulars of whioh had already been submitted and authorised me to forward to the Trans -Jordan uovemaont a list of the Sheikhs alleged to hare been responsible with a request to be informed what notice would be necessary in order to enable then to attend before the Tribunal. 7. The Tribunal net on the 11th April when 1 stated that 1 had been informed that about six weeks notice to the defendant Sheikhs would be required, and 1 sufe££stsd that as the Trans-Jordan claims had now been sent to the Hejd ooremaent and in consequence Sheikhs of Nejd tribes would also hare to attend before the Tribunal, it would be more conrenient in the circum stances for the Tribunal to adjourn until Au^ist, when the defendant 'heikhs from both sides could sttend and the Tribunal would be in a position to adjudicate at the one time upon claims by rrans-Jordan as well as claims by Hejd. After eome discussion the Mejd delegates agreed to submit this proposal to their uoremment and the&lt;11 ih« tribunal adjournad. 3. The 'Xribuaal oot attain oa the luth Uay when the Me jd delegates banded in the raeouranduu. a translation of which is attached to the inutea, etatiqg in effect that the Mejd uovemnent regarded the claims put forward by the Trans-Jordan uovoraaont aa fraudulent and fictitioua and that no useful purpose would be serred by oontinui% the sittings of the Tribunal. The delegates stated that with the presentation of this ^eooranduD their authority to represent their Gorennent oeased, and Sabri el Assali added for ny information but not officially that his GoTenment did rut propose to euanon Hejd 3heikhs to clear tbemselres froa liability for claims which the Goremaent boliered to be unfounded. The 8itti%8 of the Tribunal then terminated. 9. In ay opinion the action of the Nejd uovernnent in withdrasinb its delegates from the Tribunal was entirely unjustified. It was no doubt ri^ht and proper that the Nejd uoTorntaent should hare an opportunity of seeing the claims made by the Trans-Jordan Tribes in order that, if it were disposed to act fairly, any undisputed loot might hare been at once returned, as, indeed, it was s %gested would be done in oheikh Ycusef Yasin's letter of 24.2.1927 to the hritish Agent at Jedda. But the Hejd Gorernoent, which was a party to the iiadda Agreooent under which thie Tribunal was constituted for the Tory purpose of adjudicating upon diaputed claims, had no right to take upon iteelf to decide whether any particular claim waa true or false and thereby to oust the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, its action is ths more indefensible in that, if theee claimeoiaima war* la fact falsa or aza^aratad, the defendant . ^h^vh« had only to appear and take the oath In order to escape liability. Ihe Nejd uovemaont cannot therefore auy^sat that It acted from the fear that tke Tribunal alfeht be deeelred by falae evidence. At the Ma* an Tribunal the He ja deletes attempted to adopt a similar attitude, as appears from tele^jran No. 20lAi of 29.7.1926 froB the Hith Comiiaaionor to the British Adsnt, Jedda, and, in isy opinion, the only conolaaion to be dram la that the Nejd uoTemnent neror had ary intention of allowing the claims of the Trans- Jordan tribes to be considered, still less to be satisfied. On the other hand the Trana-Jordan uoTernnent ami its delefeatea appeared to be actuated by a desire to do what was ri^ht. it waa, perhaps, technically in error not to hare t^ven notice of its clains to the Mejd uovemnent, but one can underetand that it may veil hare felt that it would be useless to do so havinb regard to the fact mentioned by the Chief British RepreaentatiTe that the first claim made was rudely dlHoissed as fictitious and to the result, that followed whan toe claims were finally presented. 1 do not think that any real charge of delay can be liaputea to the Trans-Jordan ueTernoent, at all events so far aa the prooeedinba oi this Tribunal txa conoemed. The minutes show that the nunerous and lengthy adjournments were almost all at the request of the Hejd delegates and were due to their unwillir^naaa or inability to agree to any decision without express authority. 10. 1 see now that 1 mifcht perhaps hare forced mattersmatter* to a head at an aarliar ata^a without affeotli^ the ultiaato result and I oan only ezproaa ny ra^rat for tho additional expense that haa been caused by failure to do ao. 1 vaa, howerer. aoaawhat aloe to realiae what vaa the attitude of the tlejd uorerawmt am ny whole endearour waa to eneure that the Tribunal ahould net fail to effect ite purpose heeauae of »oae triwiality end that, if either party withdrew, it ahould appear to be manifestly in the wroi^. 11. 1 hare written throut^out in the first pereon but 1 mfar fron wiehii^ to oonoeal the ^reat assistanoe 1 received front Ur, Champion.

P0L1 riCAL.v&gt; No.33« JEDDA, March l f 1928. I Sir, V/ith reference to my despatch ISo.ZV of the 27th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a letter addressed to me by the Hejaz j^ejd Ministry for Foreign Affairs protesting against the billding of a military post at Mudawwara. 2. This action the Hejaz Government regard as contrary to the spirit of the agreement reached between Great Britain and ibn Saud to the effect that the status quo in the Maan Akaba district was to be undisturbed. 3. The Hejaz Government feel that military movements An this frontier are unnecassary in view djf the friendly relations existing between the two countries; they feel that the establishment of military posts in that area will promote ill feeling between the tribes and result in disturbances, 4. As a protest against the building of a post at Mudawwara is included in the King ! s letter to me of February 7 a summary of which was telegraphed to you under IJo.7 of the ^6th ultimo, I did not think fit to make Dr DamluJi 1 s letter the subject of a second telegram. 8.

It has loeen observed that military forces re bein^; mobilised in that region and a military fortification is beirr erected i.'or the accommodation or the troops. The Hejaz Government cannot see any justification for such, action in viev r o. :he friendly relations exi tinj bet./een the two naigh'bcuring Governments, On the contrary they loo.c upon it as a source of anxiety and disturbance in the minds of the tribesmen, I lore over apart from the absence of any valid reason for such ^reparations Your Excellency will realise that the Treaty of Jedda and the notes exchanged dia not settle the question of Laan and .■icaba re as definitely, ut the rsement then re died was th:.t the status ,uo should be left undisturbed. The aotion of the Transferdan Government in violating the text of this a. reement hie thus aroused -^reat regret and astonishment. I firmly believe the 3ritish_Government will not concur dth the ction of the Transjo-dc.n Government. I therefore beg Your Excellency to be good enough th convey the following to the British Government;- (1) The Hejaz Government see no justification for the action of the Transjordan Government in erecting forts nd taking military action in the region o ; ]Judav.'wara, nd consider th t such action impairs our resent friendly relations nd disturbs the mindsmincU: of the tribesmen of both countries.

November 5, 1928. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5269/3182/91] No. 1. Vice-Consul Jakins to Lord Cushendun.—(Received November 5 ) (No. 167.) My Lord, ^ Jeddah, October 20, 1928. I HAVE the honour to send herewith a translation of the letter from Ibn Saud referred to in my telegram No. 89. 2. His Majesty protests against the crossing of the frontier on the 20th July by aeroplanes from Transjordan, refers to five raids into Nejd between the 4th July and the 13th August, and estimates the total loot for the period Ramadan to Zil Hijja 1346 (22nd February to 20th June, 1927, if inclusive) at 1,600 camels, apart from other property, and the loss of the lives of men, women and children. His Majesty shows impatience at these acts and presses for a reply from His Majesty's Government. 3. In handing me the letter, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that the King, unwilling to allow of any variation in the tone of his correspondence on the subject, had instructed him to make a strong protest verbally. The crossing of the frontier by aeroplanes was a breach of sovereignty, and he was instructed to press for an assurance that its repetition would not be permitted. This was a matter of vital importance. An end must be put to the raids, which only served to provoke restive- ness among the Akhwan. 4. The Hejaz Government required the return of loot and reserved their right to compensation for damage. The fuller details given by the King were those promised in writing by Dr. Damluji. 5. 1 pointed out to Fuad Hamza that apparently the only outstanding details promised by Dr. Damluji were those relating to specific raids m the second half of Zil Hijja (5th to 20th June, 1928) (see Jeddah telegram No. 52), while the figures supplied by the King covered a whole period—Ramadan to Zil Hijja (22nd February to 20th June, if inclusive*. Moreover, it was difficult to reconcile the figures now given with those appearing in the list he himself had recently sent for the period Zil Hijja 1345 (May 1927) to Moharram 1347 (June 191^8). 1 asked him to ascertain exactly in what raids the 1,600 camels were taken and to obtain full details of the losses covered by the vague reference in His Majesty's letter to the looting of other properties and the killing of men, women and children. 6. He has since informed me that the estimate of His Majesty does not include the month of Zil Hijja (21st May to 20th June). It cannot, therefore, refer to the raids reported in Jeddah telegram No. 52. 7. He, moieover, states that his own list, of which 1 have*the honour to enclose a copy,* is incomplete, but that further details will be added when available. b.

(Translation.) W E hope that your Excellency will forward the following to the central British Government at London as soon as possible ;— 1. On 3.2.1347 (July 20, 1928) three aeroplanes came from Transjordan, flew over Nebk, proceeded to Kaf, the seat of the Amirate of Qariat-el-Melh, and then returned. This, as the British Government will realise, is contrary to undertakings and an infraction of covenants. 2. The investigation we ordered concerning the raids previously reported to have been committed from Transjordan on our tribes shows that the total plundered from our subjects from Ramadan up to Zil Hijja 1346 amounts to approximately 1,600 camels alone, besides men, women and children killed and the properties looted. * Not printpd. [623 e—1]3. We have received the following information concerning bands which, from the beginning of the new year, have frequently attacked our subjects and plundered them :— (a.) On 7.2.1347 (July 24, 1928) the Howeitat raided the Shararat, looting four groups of camels, numbering 160 camels in all, and killed twenty-five men. (6.) On 10.2.1347 (July 27, 1928) Mefleh-bin-Mesbeh, accompanied by ten mounted men, raided Shararat at Maiqur, looting eighty camels. (c.) On 22.2.1347 (August 8, 1928) the Howeitat raided the neighbourhood of Jauf and looted three camels from our residence there. (d.) On 25.2.1347 (August 11, 1928) the Howeitat raided the Shararat at Ramamin, taking twenty-one camels. (e.) On 27.2.1347 (August 13, 1928) the Howeitat raided the Shararat at Dian, looting five camels. We protest against all these acts and await the reply of the British Government on these matters, which are overstepping the bounds of patience. This is what we beg your Excellency to communicate to the British Government. (Respects.)

Jn forwarding the list, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, on instructions from Ibn Saud, protests against these raids. These raids have, Fuad flamza considers, passed all limits. Representations already made have proved fruitless. The Trans jordan Government is either planning these raids or is unable to prevent them In either case the situation is intolerable and Transjordan must, Fuad asserts, bear the responsibility and suffer the results. 3.

I have yesterday enacted, as a measure of public urgency, the Courts (Amendment) Or dinance, 1929, to provide that the Courts of trial for criminal cases arising out of the recent dis orders shall be composed of British judges. Representations have been made to me, which point to a belief in the minds of certain people that the trial of persons charged with criminal acts is to be confined to one section of the population. This belief does not correctly interpret the intentions of Government, which are that, since crimes of various descriptions are known to have been perpetrated by both Arabs and Jews, all offenders without distinction of race or creed will be brought to trial before the Courts to be set up under the Ordinance enacted by me yesterday. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has to-day made the following announcement:- &gt; 'Instructions were issued some days ago by the Palestine Government for ' the collection of evidence before it disappeared as to whether the disorders which ' commenced on the 23rd August were spontaneous or preconcerted. In the mean- ' time, while His Majesty's Forces are actively co-operating with the Palestine Government in restoring order, energetic steps are being taken by the civil autho- ' rities to bring to trial guilty individuals. Many arrests have been made and con- siderable progress has already been made in dealing with summary cases. Special ' measures are being taken to provide for impartial tribunals to cope with what ' will probably be a large number of cases. 'At the request of the High Commissioner the Secretary of State for the ' Colonies is appointing a Commission of Inquiry which will proceed to Palestine ' this month to inquire into the immediate causes which have led to the recent ' outbreak, including the extent to which it may be regarded as having been pre- ' concerted or due to organised action. i 11 ' The Chairman of the Commission will be Sir Walter Shaw, late Chief ' Justice of the Straits Settlements, and there will be associated with him three Members of Parliament, selected one from each of the three political parties. ' In view of the suggestions which have been made in certain quarters, the ' Secretary of State desires to make it clear that His Majesty's Government have no ' idea of reconsidering the British tenure of the Mandate for Palestine, and that no ' inquiry is contemplated which might alter the position of this country in re gard to the Mandate or policy, laid down in the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and embodied in the Mandate, of establishing in Palestine a national home for the Jews. ' The Inquiry now initiated is therefore limited to the immediate emergency and will not extend to considerations of major policy. When its report has been ' received it will be a matter of earnest consideration by His Majesty's Govern- ment along what lines, w^hin the terms of the Mandate, future policy in Pales- ' tine should be directed.'

The majority of the correspondence is between the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agency in Bahrain, the Political Agency in Kuwait, the High Commissioner in Baghdad, the Colonial and Foreign Offices, both in London, the High Commissioner in Jerusalem, the British Agency in Jeddah, the Chief British Representative in Amman, the Government of India, and Ibn Sa'ud.The majority of the papers concern the definition of borders between Ibn Sa'ud's territories (the Najd and later the Hejaz) and Trans-Jordan, most specifically the status of the Jauf [al-Jawf] area and the towns of Kaf [Kāf], Akaba [Aqaba], and Maan [Ma'an], and to a lesser extent, Iraq. Reports on tribal raids and counter-raids are also included, particularly those between the Bani Sakhr and the Ikhwan. The latter's raid just south of Amman in August 1924, and the British military response, is prominent. Details of the Hadda Tribunals, which were set up to settle such disputes, are also given. The question of where ex-King Hussein should settle after his departure from the Hijaz is also discussed.Transcripts from Parliamentary Questions on these subjects are also included (folios 178-185). At the back of the volume is a broadside announcing the Shaw Commission, following the 1929 Palestine Riots.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Ṣakhr (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Transjordania</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trans-Jordan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kāf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Maan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Jawf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al 'Aqaba</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000218#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
