Dear Sir Rupert, I am desired to refer to your Express Letter No. 2112-93/4(b), dated the 7th October 1947, and to say that during the course of the next few months a number of diplomatic and consular posts will be opened by the Government of India in countries in the Near and Middle East and, in view of the proximity of the Persian Gulf to these regions, they consider that it will be advantageous for all concerned &gt; to absorb in these posts such of the staff of the joint cadre as have opted for India. In order to facilitate gradual absorption of the staff concerned as early as possible it is necessary to have their detailed particulars of service etc. I am accordingly to request that information in the enclosed form in respect of each member of the permanent staff still on deputation with His Majesty 1 s Government may please be sent to us urgently. 2. I am to express the hope that, since the deputation of the staff with His Majesty's Government will in any case terminate after the 31st March 1948, His Majesty's Government will have no objection to releasing the staff gradually from now onwards as and when we need them with a view to the absorption of them all by the Govt, of India b}' about the end of February 1948.

I forward herewith a note giving the terms that I propose should be offered to the Indian ministerial staff whom.it will be necessary to engage for this Residency and its subordinate offices, together with statements showing (a) existing rates of pay enjoyed by clerks in this Residency and in the offices of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd. at Bahrain, (b) existing rates of dearness allowance and (c) existing rates of house rent allowance. It is proposed to offer these terms only to temporary clerks who are already serving and new entrants. 2* _ The rate of pay proposed is more generous ' than that at present in force but it has to be remembered that the ! service will be non-pensionable and liable to termination at short i notice and that at any rate for the present there will be no provident fund benefits. f• The general terms of service proposed are not exhaustive but it has been impossible for me in the time at my j disposal to work out a complete code on the lines of the Government oi India’s Fundamental Rules. i-idditions and amendments will have to be made as occasion arises. 2* With regard to the permanent staff the government of India have agreed that these should remain on 0\ % deputation until the 15th August 1948 vide Residency Printed Letter ^ ' no«51ftuBo/4 l .o dated the 7th January, 1948 thoijph they now appear inclined to go oack on this c.i. the copy of correspondence enclos ed. I am proposing to ascertain as soon as possible how many of the permanent staff are willing to retire from tne Government of India or Pakistan service and accept a contract under His Majesty's Government. It may be necessary to ask the Governments of India and Pakistan to allow a few of the oermanent staff.to remain on deputation after the 15th August 1948 if they are willing to do so in order to avoid having to fill the more important posts with young and inexperienced hands. 7 • I should be grateful for very early orders on the terms I have proposed as members of the temporary staff are likely to leave and seek service in India unless they can be assured of reasonable continuity oi service on satisfactory terms here. Many of them have already applied for employment und°r the Governments of India or Pakistan. Sd/- h.R. Hay.

A clerk will be granted one month’s leave on full pay (including special pay and dearness allowance) for every completed eleven months’ service.

No clerk shall ordinarily be entitled to leave until he has completed 18 months’ service. A clerk will receive free second-class return passages to and from his home in India or Pakistan for himself and his family members (wife and children only) who accompany once only during his three years period of service.

While travelling on tour a clerk will receive bis actual travelling expenses only plus a daily allowance where food is not provided at Government expense. For the time being daily allowance will be calculated in accordance with the present Government of India rules. GENERAL. 1 . These conditions and rules of service are not exhaustive. It will be necessary to add to them as occasion arises and it may be necessary for the Political Resident to be given authority to modify them in hard cases. 2. If any clerks in permanent employ are willing to continue to serve H.M.G. after August 15th, 1948, and if the Government of India/Pakistan are not willing to allow them to remain on deputation it will probably be necessary to offer special terms of pay in each case, but the other conditions of service approved by H.M.G. on the basis of the present proposals will almost certainly have to apply. 3. As soon as the terms now proposed have been approved by H.M.G. the existing temporary staff will be asked whether they accept them or not and their acceptance will be recorded in writing.

Unless there happened to be a serious epidemic in Iraq# when we should have to put a quarantine station on the Iraq-Kuwait land frontier# such pilgrims would not come within the scope of our quarantine operations. I think practically all quarantine buildings and equipment proper in the Gulf are owned by the States concerned. This point is being checked. There is# however# a considerable amount of equipment in Government dispensaries which is the property of the Government of India either solely or jointly with H.M.G. Lists of such equipment are being prepared.TO: COMMCMvE/iTH HEIATIONS OFFICE RPTD: POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSI/PI COLD D. 6,10 p.m, 6th Noveiriber 1947 R. 5*oo p.m. 6th November 1947 No. 9321 Addressed Secretary of State, London, repeated Bahrain* Your telegram No, 11278 September 3rd, 2, Government of India agree to His Majesty's Government retaining on suitable deputation terms minimum necessary Indian P.W.

XS03/34K(64/47) V h.Q pfy Dear Hallows, We have considered your letter (Ext 2294/47) of the 27th October to Fisher regarding staffs at Persian Gulf posts in consultation with the people in Communications and Security Departments. i As you know our regulations regarding the handling of cyphers and other secret material are pretty strict and it seems in the last degree unlikely that we should be able to agree to the retention of Anglo-Indian clerks on work of the type of that on which they have hitherto engaged. While we .appreciate your point about the difficulties of the climate for European staffs our view is that we shall have to insist upon confidential work being done by established Foreign Service officers as in all other areas. The number should, after all, be very small. We shall doubtless wish to use some of the existing staff but v/e shall, in the circumstances, have to take the risk of losing those who v/ill feel that they are losing face if they have to be employed on duties less responsible than those they have hitherto performed.

Para. 2(a). We note that Sir R. Hay in his minute on this telegram agrees v/ith the Political Resident provided his proposals for the assessment of Foreign Service allowance are in accordance with the Government of India rules on the subject. From our point of view, and on that understanding, we agree. E.P. Para. 3 of Sir R. Hay’s minute. As the Ministerial cadre on the Persian side will also he on deputation Sir R. Hay's objection to transfers from one side of the Gulf to the other lapses^ . Para. 2(h). We agree with Sir R. Hay’s minute on this para. Para. 2(c). We agree that the one month's leave was prohahly a mistake and that what we meant was the usual Government of India leave entitlement. Para. 2(d). From our point of view we agree. Para. 2(e). I have discussed this para, together with the rest of the telegram with Elliraan of the Treasury this afternoon. Although the Ministerial staff are not yet liable for U.K. income- tax, they may become so in certain circumstances at a later date, but it would clearly be unfair if Indians were suddenly doused for income-tax out of the blue. While the view is generally taken that the U.K. British subject should pay his income-tax without wincing Elliman and I both feel that there is justification in giving some sort of lead to the Ministerial staff and/ Donaldson, Esq., C.M. G. , India Office.2. and you may wish to reply to this para, on the following lines: 'V/hile Ministerial staff are not at 'present subject to income-tax it is possible 'that they may become so at a later date. 'Should this happen assurance may be given 'to them that they will not suffer an 'appreciable diminution of emoluments on this 'account.' Yours sincerely.Ext.159V47 OA Note by Sir Rupert Ha.y Political Residents telegram 812 dated 24-th July, 1947 re ministerial staff. Paragraph 2(a). We should agree with the Political Resident throughout provided his proposals for the assessment of foreign service allowance are in accordance with the Government of Indian rules on the subject which I believe to be the case. There was one point brought up at the conference which has not been recorded, viz. it was agreed that it was desirable that transfers from the Arab to the Persian side of the G-ulf and vice-versa should cease. The tenas offered apply at present only to the members of the Persian Gulf ministerial cadre who are on the Arab side of the Gulf and if transfers from one side to the other take place after 15th August unnecessary complications will arise. I suggest that this proposal should be put to the Political Resident and that he should be asked to confbm with it if he sees no insuperable objection. Paragraph 2(b). The phrase used in paragraph 3(a) of India Office telegram 93¥) was 'Permanent staff seconded for period of one year will be entitled to return passage to India'. The phrase ' one return passage' was not used. The meaning was that at the end of the year the clerk concerned would have his passage to India paid for him. This should be explained to the Political Resident. I think -fre must agree that the staff on this and other occasions should be paid their travelling allowance in accordance with the Government of Indian rules on the subject. Paragraph 2(c). I now think we made a mistake in suggesting one months leave for the permanent staff. H.M.G. will be paying leave contribution to the Government of India and the permanent staff should therefore be allowed to take leave according to the Government of India rules. They will thus take ary leave that may be due to them based on their service both before and after 15th August, 1947 and H.M.G. f s contribution will automatically cover ary leave due to them after 15 th August. It this is agreed to it will not be necessary to make any special provision for leave on medical certificate which is covered by the Government of India rules. Paragraph 2(d). The presumptions should be confirmed. Paragraph 2(e). The question of income-tax was discussed with the Treasury representative and it was contended that as the ministerial staff were British ^ndian subjects and would be paid in rupees they were in any case not liable to British income-tax. No clear ruling was given on this yoint. It is essential that the ministerial staff should be assured either Ga) that they will not be liable to British income-tax or (b) that if British income-tax is assessed in their salaries they will be paid an income-tax free allowance to cover it. Paragraph 3. The temporary staff must be allowed to take ary leave earned by them for service prior to 15th August (or be paid leave salary in—'! lieu if this is permissible under the Government of India rules) and the cost of this leave will clearly have to be shared in the principle stated by the Political Resident except that for leave based on service prior to the 1st April, 1947 the cost will in some cases be shared by H.M.G. and the Government of India.\I Copies tot— Sir* A.’Carter.

This can be done in one of two ways (a) oy embodying them in the i'oreign Service on a permanent basis, or (b) py giving them short term contracts with H.N.G. Same of the posts could also be filled by (,c) sending out officers already in the I'ore ign Service to fill them, ihese possibilities are dealt with seriatim below: (a) The Civil Service Canmission are going through the process of interviei/ing selected I.P.S. officers who have applied for the Foreign Service. This, however, is turning out to be a lengthy business as the •°V CJ : e &gt; 0 °urse, not addressing themselves to the ad hoc selection of .P.b. offioers who have Gulf experience but arc seeking to fill vacancies lor all oranches of the Foreign Service from the whole range of the Indian Services. They have so far engaged only a single member of the Indian services with Gulf experience (Hr. Hallows). It is doubtful whether much can oe done to speed up further this process of selection by the Civil Service Commission, since it depends on the rate at which candidates car be sent nome from India for interview. (d) It may Tx: possible to retain the services of certain senior I.P S officers on short term contracts, e.g. Sir H. Hay and Colonel Galloway but’ it is more doubtful, whether tire younger I.P.3. officers with Gulf experience 11. willing to accept short term contracts (except perhaps for a few mon.ns only) as this would naturally prejudice their chances of securing ompl ^ mont in ***&gt; field. They will be at liberty to retire .rom Govern,lent service on 15th August. Probably several of them could get ' AAv? 3 °^ V,ltn H° r* 1 U know of one who has received such a, offer), da,/ever d.h.G. must presumably offer these officers such short /termtcm contracts for t ho months unmcdlately succccdinp; 1 ‘ 5 th-,ug;ust unless there is tD lx a complete hiatus in the administration, ilarlv steps to this end arc essential . These contracts might be in the form of extension of their present rates of pay and allovanccs for a given xoeriod, say up to 31st Harch, 1943. h list of present Persian G-ulf staff v/ith their position is attached. (c) It seems desirable that the Foreign Office should send out at once one or ty.ro .junior Foreign Service men to fill /j unior -posts (o.g. .assistant Political Agent) though primarily mth the object of learning the job of being Political Officers. This i.all holjp the Political Resident out with his staffing questions. In order to be much use they v.dll have to learn Irabic and how to administer the Indian Legal Codes. Unless the Foreign Office take such steps there is a real danger of the Persian Gulf administrat ion falling down in tv/o or three years owing to the lack of quel ified officers. 3. To sum up the answer to the Government of India's question (i). Since the Indian Political Service comes to an end on 13 th .^ugust the superior service officers in the Persian Gulf will then have to become the servants of H.L.G. after tnat date, and the staffing arrangements so far as these officers are concerned can thus no longer remain the responsibility of the Government of India. Contracts with selected officers will have to be entered into e it lie r by the Department which succeeds to the functions of the India. Office or the Foreign Office an soon as possible. In either case it would seen most convenient for their salaries to be borne on the India Office Vote after 13th ..ugust, for the rest of the financial year 1947-2+8. Steps under (c) above might also be taken. 4. To turn now to the Government of India's question (2; - -whether H.P.G. now contemplate taking over direct administration of tho Gulf before 1 st _-pril, 1948. By 'direct administration' the Government of India mean in effect the provision of staff and services from U.4. sources. With regard to superior staff, we have already seen that with the dissolution of the I.P.S. on 13th Lugust tne Government of India will no longer be in a position to supply such staff. The subordinate (or ministerial) staPf at present employed belongs to the Government of India central subordinate services or is recruited locally. Unlike the I.P.3. these services will not cease to be on 15th ,-ugust. Until subordinate staff can be taken into the Foreign Service, or new subordinate staff recruited, it seems almost inevitable to ask the Government of India to continue to provide it on an agency basis until 1st -pril, 1948. The same applies to quarantine and medical (Indian medical Department), Postal (Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department) and P. J.D. staff. It is doubtful whether it would be physically possible for H.M.G, to take tiiooo services over before .Vpril, 1948. It should, however, be jr^dlised that the staff themselves ¥111 wish their position clarified as soon as possiole, and in default of any assurances as to their future Y/ill -wish to get away from the Persian Gulf. It seems therefore tuat the answer to the Government of India's question must be that HU.G. would like the Government of India to continue to provide ministerial (as well as medical, P. LD. and postal) staff on an agency basis until 1st .qoril, 1948, as they previously agreed, but that since the I.P.S. will cease to exist from 13th . .ugust, a.II,G. will themselves have to take over responsibility for the provision of superior officers as from that date.

Members of the ministerial staff have been encouraged to pass simple coloquial examinations in Arabic and Persian. 7. Para 2 of the Foreign Office memorandum. I shall deal fairly comprehensively with this point because I think the Foreign Office should know exactly what they are up against in the matter of providing staff, both immediately and in the near future. 8 . The pre-war officer establishment of the Persian Gulf Residency was s PERSIAN SIDE Bushire. 1 Political Resident and Consul General. 1 Secretary to the Political Resident and Consul, Bushire. 1 Under Secretary to the Political Resident. 1 Personal Assistant to the Political Resident.

Muscat . 1 Political Agent. 11 Total The leave and training reserve was borne on the general cadre of the Indian Political Service; but, in practice, there has been no training reserve and only a most inadequate leave reserve since 1939. This establishment had remained practically unchanged since 190P, in spite of the development of our interests in oil and strategic and civil air lines on the Arab side of the Gulf. 9* Early in the war it was found necessary to post a junior officer as Political Officer on the Trucial Coast with headquarters at Sharjah; and later an Assistant Political Agent at Muscat to look after the Southern Arabian air route and to be with the Sultan who lives on the air route. The Vice-Consulate at Khorraifhahr was raised to a Consulate and additional iunior Officers wure posted to Khorrmas! ahr and to Bandar Abbas as Vice-Consuls. The post of the Secretary to the Political Resident and Consul at Bushire was aplit into two separate senior posts, and the Indian Political Service cadre provided the Vice-Consul at Brshire previously provided by the Foreign Office. 10. At the end of the war, before it was decided that the Indian Political Service was uo be wound up, the question of the future requirements of Indian Political Service Officers to staff the Persian Gulf and South a nd East Persian posts was exhaustively considered; and, at any rate so far as the Arab side of the Gulf is conc&lt; rnea, the recommendations then made are valid today. H* It is desirable, if our administration is to keep pace with the development of our interests, that the plans already worked out for the Arab side should be implemented as soon as possible. You will appreciate that our posts on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf are not quite the same as the general run of diplomatic or consular posts. Much of the day to day work is of an executive and administrative nature. 1 2 « With the exploration for oil on the Trucial Coast and our assumption of jurisdiction over Brirish subjects and foreigners it will be necessary to make the post of Political Officer, Trucial Coast, permanent, and to raise it to the status of a Political Agency — a senior post. It will later be necessary to post an Assistant Political A^ent there in addition The'3- The post cf -Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain, a temporary post for the last twenty years, should also be made permanent. There is no possibility of its being retrenched; and, with oil developments, there is already a case for an Assistant Political Agent at Qatar under the Bahrain Agency to assist the oil company and to administer the Qatar Order in Counsil, and perhaps for a second Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain in the near future. The Assistant Political Agent there is already overworked and his work is increasing. The same applies to Kuwait with the rapiddevelopfient of oil resources that is now taking place; and the Assistant Political Agent at Muscat should he retained so that an officer will be available to make prolonged visits to the Sultan at Dhofar from time to time and also because of oil exploration projected in the Sultan’s territories. 13. Since 1939 it has not been possible to fill the post of Personal Assistant to the Political Resident with an Officer. This was a post for a probationer under training and provided a valuable opportunity for young officers to get experience in the Persian Gulf and to study the languages. It has not been filled since 1939 because there have been no junior officers under training since then. I feel it should be filled again by a young officer as soon as possible. 14. T’ e post of Under Secretary to the Political Resident has also from time to time been filled by a Gazetted Officer of the ministerial establishment because young officers of the Indian Politics! Service were not always available, tflth the growth of the oil companies and the administrative and legal problems that follow, certainly one officer, and perhaps two, will be required for this and a similar additional post to be created, 1£. During the war the Ministry of Information provided a Public Relations Officer and the British Council provided an Educational Adviser for the Persian Gulf, stationed at Bahrain. The Ministry of Information have withdrawn the Public Relations Officer whose work is now done by the Political Agent. Bahrain. The Erit sh Godneil have been unable to find an Educational Adviser for Bahrain and Kuwait for over a year; and I have already suggested In my demi-official letter No.348-3 dated the 7th May, 1347, the creation cf a ccrabined post of Educational Adviser and Public Relations Officer for the Persian Gulf Residency. The post of the Public Relations Officer was, in its inception, held by an Indian Political Service Officer and this arrangement was only abaiidoned when it was no longer possible to spare a whole-time officer for the post. 16, To sum up I consider that the following cadre of officers — excluding medical and ether specialist officers — should be provided as soon as possible for the Arab side of the Gulf : RESIDEN CY AT BAHRAIN 1 Resident 1 Secretary to the Resident. 1 Under Secretary (plus a second in the near future). 1 Educational Adviser and Public Relations Officer. 1 Personal Assistant to the Resident. POLITICAL AGLiVCY at bar lain 1 Political Agent, 1 Assistant Political Agent (plus a second in the near future). 1 Political Officer at Qatar. POLITICALl politic*!

The rules provide for the grant of a year f s leave for each language. During the war it was not possible, except in a few cases, to grant this leave to officers, and they had to learn both Arabic and Persian in what should have been their leisure hours. This imposed, in the Persian Gulf climate, a very heavy strain on the officers themselves and proved a very wasteful system. Only the most enthusiastic ever succeeded In fully qualifying themselves in the languages, and many officers return- to India without having learned them — their political and other experience of the Gulf being, for this reason, largely wasted. It will be necessary either to send officers to learn Arabic in a good climate before posting them to the Persian Gulf, or, alternatively, to provide training posts — such as that of the Personal Assistant to the Resident — in the Persian Gulf itself. None of the Rulers here — with the exception of Muscat — speaks any English at all; and the Trucial Shaikhs are particularly backward. 20. Foreign Service officers posted to the Persian Gulf will also need to be trained in law to exercise jurisdiction over British and American subjects and other foreign nationals. This, and the necessity of learning Arabic requires a training reserve. 21. Leave t The unenviable climate of the Persian Gulf makes it necessary for officers serving in the Persian G ulf to have regular leave, nhtali^xtnxininycMyitx«nxnxia»yaxrns«nai^ which, in turn, requires a leave reserve. Since 1939, officers serving here have had only a fraction of the leave to which they are entitled, owing to the difficulty of replacing them. Indeed, the task of staffing the Persian Gulf has always, even in peace time, been one of very considerable difficulty; and the history of it has been a sorry story of officers who came, saw, and — with a few notable exceptions — returned to India before they had gained sufficient experience or knowledge of the languages to be really useful. The lack of proper housing for junior officers has also made the Persian Gulf a particularly unattractive place for young married officers. 22. As the number of officers employed increases, the size of the ministerial establishment will have to be increased roughly In the proportion mentioned in para 27 below, although, as the increase will be in junior officers, a lower proportion may suffice. 23. The additional information required in para 4 of Wilson’s letter to you is given below t The mom-gazetted ministerial staff are divided into the following categories t (a) Lower Division; (b) Upper Division; and (c) Special Grade.

We are indeed very alive to the need for a really quick decision on the points raised by Hay in his letterj copy of which you enclosed with yours. At the same time we cannot reach one for the moment and on the present^nfomation. Nevertheless it does look to us as if we shall want to keep on for the time being nearly all the present staff and we hope to be able to offer them a job on their present terms including, we hope, pensions. But of course our own ideas are only now c rystalizing and they will be subject to whatever m&amp;y be decided in a number of places and in particular at the Treasury. We are, of course, most anxious to see Hay as soon as possible and we rely on you to let us know when he will be available for a meeting. (A.J. Gar&lt;t Ao ^7 ^7- &lt;7^ VIII I MINISTERIAL STAFF. We are considering the future of the joint Persia and Persian Gulf clerical cadre as a whole and the lists enclosed with Hay’s note, together with the enclosures to our Express Letted No: F.15(8)-BPG/47, dated 9th May, 1947, will give a fairly complete picture of the present position. f 2. Provided that present plans for Indian representation in Persia, and the Middle East generally, mature, we anticipate little difficulty in absorbing into the new Posts as many of the existing clerical cadre as wish to continue to serve the Indian Government. The precise terms of service are still under discussion here, but there is every reason to hope that they will be at least as good as those at present enjoyed by t'he Permanent clerical staff of this cadre. We shall naturally communicate these terms of service to the staff as soon as they are finally settled. In order both to enable the men to come to a f?ir decision about their future and to-avoid confusion and dislocation in the final handing over of charge, it seems to us important that an indication should be available as soon as possible of His Majesty’s Government's plans in this connection - the number of suitable clerical personnel they would be willing to take over, with an indication of the approximate ranks or grades required and the terms of service. We hope that it will be possible, for you to let us have some details on these lines shortly for communication to this staff.oibctract from a Personal letter from the Political Resident to Hr. Donaldson dated 2dth Ray, 1 &gt;'1 1 3, The second point vihich I wish to stress in this letter Is the necessity for some pronouncement by His Majesty 1 s G-overnment about the iiiinisterial staff in the G-ulf. You mil have seen from enclosure Ko.VIII to my demi-official letter Ho.921-3 dated the &gt;tni ;iay, 194 . , t'uat practically none of the present staff are ^Tilling to continue to sei’ve under His Majesty's G-overnaent. The reasons for this are:- (a) their fear that if they volunteer to serve'under His Majesty' s G-overnment their chances for obtaining permanent employment in an Indian Service may be prejudicial, . (*b) tne lack- of* ary prone mice;, .ent by Mis Majesty's Government abouthe future conditions of service and (c). # the..kndc.tlelge that the foreign Office are unlikely to ler.,-^^cb^iae ;tial work in the lards of Indian nations. r!

It should be 1 'ealised that except for a few Arab mnnshis the ministerial staff is composed exclusively of Indian nationals and that it is impossible to recruit .m’abs in their -lace. My views are roughly as follor/s:- (.J The Foreign Office should matte up their minds how many Indian clerks 'they are willing to employ permanently on a pensionable basis and on what terms. I will then see how many 1 can recruit. If any clerms in the permanent service of the Government of India are willing to transfer to His Majesty's Government's Service. some arrangement will have t 0 be reached with the Government of India regarding one eventual liability for payraent of pens ions. /(B)/ \ '!

IX ‘j MIHISiai Consideration of this question must be based'on complete and exact particulars of the staff concerned. A list giving available details of the Persian Gulf Ministerial staff, both permanent and temporary, is enclosed for the Political Resident's information. We should be glad if he would have this list brought up to date, completed and corrected, and returned as'soon as possible. All relevant information should be added, -Deluding details of any liens held on substantive appointments in Central or Provincial sources in India. There appear ultimately to be 4 main possibilities for the existing ministerial staff:- (1) They may return to India and be absorbed in Government service in India. For such as have retained liens on Indian appointments, this will present little difficulty but for the remainder a possible snag will be the fact that they were not enlisted through the F.P.S.C. This matter is being examined, (2) They may join the clerical cadre of the Indian Foreign Service in Persia and the Persian Gulf. It is not yet possible to give even an approximate indication of the total strength of clerical staff that will be required to man India's Foreign Service posts in Persia and the Persian Gulf, or to state terms of service? but the existing Persian Gulf clerical staff may be expected to have first call on these appointments, (3) They may join the clerical cadre of the Indian Foreign Service for service either in^Gulf or elsewhere abroad, lore again it is not possible to say what numbers are likely to be absorbed nor what the terms will be? but the fact that members of the Persian Gulf cadre have /alreadyhad experience of living abroad and dealing with foreign peoples will doubtless weigh with the selectors, (4) They may be retained by H.M.G. for continued service in the Gulf after transfer. It is not known how n.M.G. proposes to enroll ministerial staff for the Gulf posts, but it is a reasonable assumption that some at least of the existing staff, subject of course to their being suitable and to their willingness to stay on, will be retained by H.M.G. The question of the | terms on which H.M.G. would be prepared to take on such ^ f personnel will be the subject of an early reference to H.M.G. It is at this stage clearly impossible to give any definite assurances regarding the future of the Persian Gulf ministerial cadre. The Political Resident should, however, be asked at this stage to have these 4 possibili ties explained to his ministerial staffs, purely as eventual possibilities, and to ascertain urgently what their reactions are. We require as soon as possible a comprehensive statement showing, in respect of each member of the Gulf's clerical cadre, v/hich, in order of preference, of the above alternatives, he is willing to adopt.- 5 - Til.

B.P. Donaldson. \r kJUU^ 1. Please refer to ray demi-official letter No.P/7 dated the 8th February 1947 and its enclosure^ '— 2 . I have been thinking a good deal about the future of our ministerial staff here. They are naturally worried about the question themselves, and the permanent hands are mostly applying for transfer to the Indian Foreign Service while temporary hands are seeking employment with the oil companies. I can do little to persuade them to stay on because I have no idea how many of them if any the Foreign Office will be willing to retain on a permanent basis when it takes over. Meanwhile there is a danger that we shall shortly find ourselves with a completely inadequate staff. 3. At present roughly speaking our confidential office -s are staffed by iinglo-Indians and our ordinary offices by Indians. The confidential offices handle cypher work and secret papers generally. Will the Foreign Office be willing to continue to employ Anglo-Indians who are Indian nationals? In the other offices will they allow us to continue to employ iinglo-Indians or Indians on a pensionable basis? Will they want drastically to reduce our staff? I doubt in any case if much can be done in the way of reduction in view of the amount of administrative work for which we are responsible. 4. I would suggest that as soon as possible the Foreign Office should send out some senior clerk with experience of establishment matters to go into the whole question of our future ministerial staff here.Meanwhile could you let me know whether any of our staff are likely to be kept on more or less on their present conditions of service? I should like to be in a position to say something to them on the subject. 5. The situation is futher complicated by the fact that the Persian Gulf cadre also staffs all the Consulates in Persia which are manned by the Government of India.
