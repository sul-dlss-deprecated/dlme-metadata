He also said that he did not know if Sheikh vobarak was aware of the friendly interest and solidw.ie with which His Imperial ^aiesty the Sultan watched Shaikh obarak and hos doines and how His Hale sty was continually sending* roes- -sag’es to the local Tarkish authorities to safest ad Sheikh vob'vak f s interests in ©vary way. ^o this the sheikh ap- -pears to have made suitable acknowledgements. 4. somehow or other, in srite of the courtesy visit , the talk insensibly drifted to business matters, onsie r wonokha'as bap^n talking* of his f?.ne line of steamers and expressed owriosity as to how and whence ftoweit town drew its snrnlies .

It was intended to show that Shaikh Vobarak remains faithful to his engagements in srite of tempting offers to seduce him. \Sx ^ % f\* uluy No. C-22 (Confidential), dated Kuwait, thes 19th April 1911. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that, when he came to see me this morning, Shaikh Mubarak informed me that about 10 days ago he had received a letter from the German Consul in Basrah accompanying another from Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co. praying for permission to open a branch of their business in Kuwait. 2. The letters were brought by a man of the name of Abdulla bin Ustad Ahmed, who said he was Messrs. Wonckhaus’ agent and purchased skins and furs for the firm. He was not a Kuwait man and is not known here. 3. The Shaikh brought his Secretary with him and had the letters read over to me. That from the German Consul merely recommended Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co. as merchants who traded at other ports in the Gulf and wished to open an agency in Kuwait, to which they would appoint a Kuwait man who would trade in the same articles as the firm dealt with elsewhere. The Consul hoped that the Shaikh would accord the requisite permission and that in case of necessity he would find the firm useful to him. The Consul’s letter was dated the 3rd Azar 1911 (Turkish Calendar) and the address and superscription were given as “ Shaikh Mubarak Pasha bin Subah”, the Turkish title of Qaimmaqam not being employed. The Arabic letter was written in parallel columns with a German translation and I regret I was unable to decipher the signature. Messers Wonckhaus’ letter was to much the same effect. 4. The Shaikh enquired from me what answer he should return for he must send some reply to the representative of a Foreign Government, and though he could deal easily enough with Arabs and Turks, he preferred to have British advice in this case. I replied that without reference I was not prepared to frame an answer for him but no doubt he knew as well as myself that all German trade in the Persian Gulf at present was carried on for political ends, and that this particular firm traded in a manner which left little doubt that their losses must be guaranteed by the German Government. In the circumstances it appeared to me as an obvious effort to open the way to German trade and influence and he probably knew that though the opening of such a door was easy it frequently led to future difficulties and he might find the subsequent closing of it difficult. No doubt he would be able to return a polite answer without my assistance, while I addressed the Political Resident on the subject.t * 1 2 5. In this connection I would invite a reference to my predecessor’s letter No. 479, dated the 3rd September 1907, and beg that early instructions may be sent to me. Sub-enclosure 1. Translation.

Brown, representing '*Vonckhaus &amp; Co*, recently addressed the Sheikh of Koweit, through the medium of the newly ap pointed German d 0 nsul, with an application expressing the intention of sending a business Agent to ^oweit• Consul officially asked Sheikh*s permission for him to do so. Sheikh not lining to keep the messenger waiting replied to °onsul saying that he would shortly be visiting Mohammerah and that they could interview him there. Two days later I arrived at noweit and the Sheikh requested idvice as to what attitude he should adopt towards them. I pointed out to Sheikh that by inaugurating official correspondence with German w onsul at Busreh he was admitting the awkward assumption that Koweit lay within the sphere of Busreh. I therefore advised him, in case matter was again brought up before receipt of views of Government, to remind German Consul that no arrangements ex isted for the interchange of official correspondence with hiin, and add that he could not embark on any now, and that there fore iVonckhaus should make his application direct. (i) Does this reply to German Consul seem suitable ? (ii) Sheikh suggests that his reply to Wonckhaus should take the form that in his opinion the time is not yet ripe for opening European AgnJ^cies in Roweit. It is doubtful, how ever, whether he can long maintain this attitude: but sup posing he had to receive v/onckhaua*s agent in j\oweit, would it be feasible for the Sheikh to impose the sane stipulation on the firm as he recently did in the case of the Doctor of the AmericaAi Mission.Telegram - P.

If any further move is made by the German Consul, the Sheikh might go further than making it very plain the fact that he does not consider himself within the sphere of Busreh, by giving out that in matters re quiring Consular intervention he regards himself as ?/ithin the jurisdiction of the Consul at Bushire. Your stipulation as to »Vonckhaus opening an agency at ivovveit cannot be imposed but Sheikh’s proposed reply to ./onckhaus is suitable as serving the purpose of keeping firms out of Aoweit for the present. \\o./4JS Of 1911.

Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To— Lieutenant-Colonel, P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You will have seen references in my diaries to the efforts of Wonckhaus’s agents here. I enclose a Note in the same connection. I doubt whether their purchases have reached the figure of T ^ 1 !,ooo, but there is no doubt that they are buying, quite regardless of prices and possible profits, anything which comes along. The B. I. Agent tells me that he has been sending reports to Lyle in Basrab about them. When the subject cropped up with the Shaikh, he said he knew of their efforts and could not see what possible profit they could make. I don’t know whether the German ship is really coming, but I only heard yesterday of it too late to ask the Shaikh. I am keeping a lookout for more news about them, and hope to get hold of a few more facts than are at present available ; at present everybody prefaces his remarks with “ they say, etc. NOTE. In addition to the purchases of barley, which All Bash made and which we reported in our diaries, it is stated that he has also been buying and exporting large quantities of wool, hides, lamb-skins, etc., to Basrah by native boats pro bably for shipment from there by German ships. It is said that he has so far bought goods here to the value of about T £ 11,000. Some 300 f ‘tagars ” of paddy (unhusked rice) and about 4,000 mats were, it appears, received by him from Basrah by country boats and sold here on the firm’s account during the last 2 or 3 months. It is said that they expect shortly to introduce German soft and loaf sugar, kerosine oil, and other goods in the Kuwait market. Ali Bash is stated to be on very friendly terms with Abdul Mohsin, the Shaikh’^ Customs Master, and that the latter is using his influence in securing enterprising men and merchants to push the firm’s interests. Much of the success that has attended to Ali Bash in his transactions within such a short space of time is said to be due entirely to the support and help which he has received from Abdul Mohsin. The whole quantity of barley bought by him is still lying in the customs. Probably it is awaiting the arrival of the German ship which is rumoured to be due to arrive here in a week or two more. Some 4,000 bags or baskets of dates, it appears, are already booked by Kuwait merchants for Aden to go by the above steamer. Kuwait, dated 21st Jime 1911.2 Extract from Kuwait Agency Diary for week ending 2 $th May iqii. Foreign Interests. 203. Ali Bash, a Persian, who has been in Kuwait for about two months and is said to be acting on behalf of the German firm of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co., has started making large purchases of barley, and the price therefore has risen in Kuwait from $40 to $60 per “itkhar” (20 maunds) Abdul Mohsin, the Shaikh's Customs Master, and Mohamed bin Mutair an Arab petty merchant, are said to be helping him in his transactions and acting as his brokers. _ s Extract from Kuwait Agency Diary for week ending jis/ May iqii.

Wonckhaus has paid export duty on leaving Persian Ports, they would be paying, at the rates at which they buy, 18^ per cent duty, which would not pay them. The presump tion is, therefore, that most of it has evaded export duty. Enclosure 1. N°- 1755 &gt; dated the 1 ith July 1911. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z.

Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait. ~ I have the honour to refer to your recent diary entries^ from 25th May onwards, regarding the purchase and shipment of barley from Kuwait by Messrs. Wonckhaus. 2. Having regard to the views expressed to you by Kuwait merchants, and from our own knowledge of the maximum prices at which exporters of barley from this side are able to buy and ship the grain, there is hardly room for doubt that the German firm are trading on terms which in themselves involve considerable financial loss. . The presumption is, therefore, that they are doing it with a specific object in view. . f h ave the honour to request that you will take an early opportunity of pointing out this aspect of the matter to Shaikh Mubarak, and inform him that 1 regard the barley buying enterprise with considerable suspicion on the above grounds, and trust he will watch it very critically and consult you fully as to the best means of protecting his interests. , The barle y in question is admittedly Persian barley and unless it is smucr- gleci out without paying duty, it is difficult to see what possible gain it can be to Messrs. VVonckhaus to buy the grain in P^uwait thus paying Kuwait import duty, instead of purchasing in Persian Ports. Please keep me informed of developments. Enclosure 2. No. 355 * dated 2nd August 1911. From Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your letter No. 1755, dated the nth July ion, I have the honour to report that 1 take every opportunity of pointing out to ShaikhMubarak that the efforts of the German firm of Wonckhaus &amp; Co., to obtain a footing in Kuwait appear to have other than purely legitimate commercial ends in view. 2. On receipt of your letter I again brought the matter to his notice, and he agreed that from the prices they seemed willing to pay a commercial profit appeared to be the last object. He informed me that he had given his Customs- master strict orders to treat the firm's representations with caution. This warning was certainly required as it was common report in the town that Messrs. Wonckhaus' most active assistant in Kuwait was the Shaikh’s Customs-master. 3. As will appear from my diary for this week, the firm shipped 300 bags of sugar from Bushire by the Arab Steamer S. S. “ Budrie ”. The consignment was “ to order ”, and the Shaikh remarked upon it to me, in conversation, saying that he was waiting to see who would take delivery and would inform me later. r' Enclosure 3.

Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. v , j^rso, \'\ In continuation of my letter No. 355, dated the 2nd August 1911, I have the honour to report in connection with the efforts being made by Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., to establish themselves at this port, that Shaikh Mubarak related to me the following conversation which he had with the firm’s representa tive, Abdulla “ German! ”, since the latter’s return to Kuwait. 2. The Shaikh said that he had informed Abdulla “ German! ” that he objected to their wholesale purchases of grain in Kuwait for the reason that such purchases seriously disturbed the small local market and caused very consider able distress to the poorer population by the artificial inflation of prices. He could not see the firm’s object in buying in Kuwait when they could equally easily purchase direct from the country where the grain was produced and at the same time save the extra Customs dues, landing fees, etc., which added to the price in Kuwait. If the firm wanted boats for shipments he had no objection to their utilizing Kuwait boats, as that procedure would bring in a return to his seafaring subjects without making it harder for poor people to buy their food. He had already heard grumbles from his people at the high prices which had resulted from the firm’s purchases, and not wishing to hear more he wished the firm to buy their grain elsewhere, when they could employ Kuwait labour ip the boats if they liked without causing loss to his people. 3. It remains to be seen what effect the Shaikh’s objection has, but there can be little doubt that it meets with general approval locally. The Shaikh’s own objection, together with his recent action in regard to his Customs’ manage ment, and the warbing (reported in my above-quoted letter) to his Customs- master will, it is to be hoped, have some retarding influence on the German firm’s local ambitions. 4. With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No. 355, dated 2nd August 1911, you will have seen from my diary for the weol^ ending 9th August 1911 that delivery of the consignment of 300 bags of sugar^hipped by S. S. “ Budrie ” has been refused by the consignee, and the sugar remains in the Customs ware house.'-1 nf\ i- ' ' i r ' :'■ v. v ■ \rPy' w - •v k N ’ r ‘. \W ‘ ^ No. 227 , dated Bushire, the 10 th (received 20 th) February 1912 (Confidential).

He added that while he was at Eailiyah he was visited by one of the European staff of the firm, presumably by Mr. Brown, who endeavoured to obtain permission to open a branch in Kuwait under the charge of a European, and to purchase or lease permanent premises The Shaikh said that he refused to entertain the idea and finally when Mr. Brown pressed him for his reasons in discriminating between British and other merchants the Shaikh said that the cases were not analogous, his rela tions with Indian merchants were of long standing and that he did not wish himself saddled with the difficulties which were certain to arise if any of the German firm s creditors defaulted. He added that eventually he told Mr. Brown that if the German firm desired they could address the Political Agent in Kuwait and if that officer recommended their application he himself might possibly consider it.No. 1233, dated Bushire, the 22nd (received 29th) June 1912.

Wonckhaus &amp; Co. to establish them selves in Kuwait. No. C.-47, dated Kuwait, the 10th June 1912. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, LA., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushi In continuation of this office letter No. IC.-q., dated the 1st February 1912, I have the honour to report that about the middle of May the German firm of Messrs. Wonckhaus apparently decided to close their office in Kuwait, for their agent, Abdulla “ German! ”, then removed his family, office furniture, etc., to Bahrain and the premises occupied by him have been closed, no one being left in charge of firm’s interests. 2. Sheikh Mubarak has told me that he has again been approached by Mr. Brown for permission to place a European assistant in Kuwait, offers of extrava gant sums as Customs duties in advance having been promised together with a minimum of such revenue from the firm. The Shaikh said that he returned an answer similar to his former one, vis., that the firm should first address the Resident at Bushire or the Political Agent at Kuwait. 3. The firm’s business as conducted by Abdulla “ German! ” has not amounted to much ; some 150 to 200 tons of wheat and barley were purchased in the Mashur and Hindyan District and shipped to Basra by native boats after first having been brought to Kuwait. Some 150 bundles of raw wool were also bought in the local market and shipped with the grain to Basra in the winter., confidential NO cs-z From, TO, Of 1912. Political Agency, Kuwait • 3rd July 1912. Captain w# E. I. shakeapoar, I. A., Political Agent, KUWAIT • The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE, Sir, ST I have the honour to invite a reference to the correapondence ending with ray letter No 0«»47 dated the iOih June 1917, reporting the efforts of Messrs wonokhaus &amp; Co to obtain a permanent footing in Kuwait, 2 , I am informed by the Shaikh that after his re* -turn to Kuwait he was one day approached by Alexander For- -age, a Baghdadi Christian in the employ of Messrs Wonck- »haus and Company who recently returned to Kuwait, with a request for a confidential interview. After some ordinary conversation, similar to that already reported requesting permission for the firm to establish a European agent in Ku* -wait, the talk drifted to politics with special reference to the Baghdad Railway, According to the Shaikh, Forage first enquired as to the ownership of Omr Kasr saying that the terminus of the railway would probably be located at that point. The reply was that Emr Kasr had belonged to the As-Subah for many years, that the present fort there was ac- -tnally built by Sheikh Jabir (the grandfather of Mubarak) for the protection of the wells and such Kuwaitis as their business took to that region. Forage questioned the Shaikh b eing— bsins a bio to r^,intaln thlo ol%lm in view of tli© f*ot txiat % Tnrkieh ioiftohnent aotn^lly ooonpiod theffort. The ^heikhS reply w*s that hie bonnclariee to the north were and had been for ^enorationa fror? the Batin depreesion near the Ar»Ratk rider© eastwards to «Tabal Sana®* Safwan and thenoe to Umr Kaor and the eea* ^he Tr?rk3 had placed theae small detach* •mente in 3afwan # Vmr Ka^ir and Bnbiyan only acme eif^.t or nine voara a^o after they diaoovored that an ag^reaaion son* • teiuplated by them on ftnwait itself woald not bo permitted bw the Rnplleh? br?t the oeonpation of a place by half*a* -dozen soldiers for eiffhi years oomld searoely be held to abrogate the Ae*3nbah f a rights which had existed for genera* *tions. Farther that oven now ahonld any raid be made with- •in the bonndaries nawed, redress was always demanded from and obtained ihrongh ^nbarak as the reoognlsed mler of the territory in which the raid had taken place * Of conrse if the Tnrks intended to seize the place by force that was another matter: and if their intention should be to make the place of importance without consulting him, he vo^ald certaia -ly arisert his rights in a manner sufficiently forcible to leave no doubt as to his claims* He wonld have done so befodf bat for the fact that the place was of small valne at the time of the Turkish occupation and certainly not worth risk- •ing the possible oonseqnenoos of a forcible opposition at that time to the weight of the whole Ottoman Government* 4* In parenthesis t would here observe that the Shaikh’s claim to the lino which he describes as his northern boundary is t to my own personal knowledge, justified by the terrain, in so ranch that, if a recognizable natural boundary can be said to exist in a desert, on© certainly is traceable along the line indicated* Also, that Arabs whether Bedouin or townsmen invariably do apply to T^barak for redress if looted■ MiC\ ■ y looted or raolested within (that is— to the gonth of) this line# Pnrthor, that to this day the garrisons in Safwan and Umr Kasr have continned to exist only on snffo^anoe# 4 , Forage then sne^osted to the Shaikh that if he was willing to 3e ase or sell any part of his territory to the Oeripan Railwaw company he conld easily be assured nn •disputed possession of Safwan, Unsr Kasr and Brnbiyan, for the German Emperor was mnoh interested in the Ra Iway and his word carried ^reat weight at Oonstan*oinopl© * rorapo had no doubt that if the Shaikh complained of the Turkish oo- -cnpation of these points , the German Emproor would soon oa^se them to be evacuated# The Railway company wanted to obtain a site on the seaboard for their terminus and wore prepared to cjive the Shaikh what he liked to ask for the lease or sale of a suitable place# He went on to expatiate on the advantages and profits whic? would accrue to the /X Shaikh from the advent of a isreat railway, the inorease of trade and consequent improvement of Oustoms revenues# eto# After more of the same nature the Shaikh observed the conversation seemed to have drifted a long way from Messrs Wongkha^s A 0© , 3 desire to open a branch agency of their business in Kuwait town and savoured more of what mig&gt;i^ be expected from a diplomatic envoy rather than a plain mer» -chant # To this Forage replied that he was merely oonoern- -ed to show the shaikh how ha could profit himself, avoid losses and ass^ re Ms position and that the talk had been with quite disinterested motives whore it want beyond the firm f s own request# E. I have reported the story in some detail as it was given to me by the Shaikh himself # ^tnd though he nay have added embe lishments in order to inflate his own import •ance in cur eyes the fact remains that he has been approach -ed-dd more or less openly in Oermn inter© a is %t % time when no^otiationa are oatensihly in progress only between the Bri • tiah and Turkish (JeTernroonta* and that an effort ia being pade to obtain a definite olai® to some suitable or possible site for a railway teriBinns* I onld add that any news regarding the Baghdad Rail- -way f allocation of its oarital , diaoneeion of possible sitea for a tominns* eto ia aonght and disonaaed diligent- •ly and keenly by all the &gt;ette- edneated in the town and none with icore acninc-n than the Shaikh* I havo the honour tobe.
