Sir, I am directed to say that the Secretary of State has accepted the recommendation of the Government of India which was based on certain proposals made in April 1946, hut slightly modified in the lipht of the concessions granted to military officers for short leave in the United Kingdom, that with retrospective effect from the start of the sea key leave scheme officers should be allowed free passage one way and should be charged for double journey on the basis of sea Journey one way as follows x - (a) one way by sea and one by air - actual cost of sea passage; (b) both ways by sea - half of total of both journeys; (c) both ways by air - £ 76 being standard average cost of sea passage. In agreement with the position existing in the military, no concession was proposed for wives 1 passages. 2. The Secretary of State has, however, observed that this sanction is subject to possible reconsideration of the amounts to be paid by officers in the light of the eventual decision In regard to the military personnel who travel by air. The Government of India consider that subject to such adjustments as may be necessary in future action may now be taken in the light of the above orders. 3. Any travelling allowance concession which may now be admissible to officers proceeding on leave in India for rest and recuperation will not be granted during the year in which the above concession is utilised. * &gt; I have the honour to be.

To The Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# Dated New Delhi, the 20th August, 1945. Ex-India Leave Passage concessions Sir, I am directed to refer to the letter from the External^ Affairs Department f Ho. 1938-E(D)/45 J dated the 6th July t 1946| and to say that these passage concessions are applicable to alJ. officers entitled to passage benefits nnder the Superior Civil Rules who proceed or have proceeded on key leave ex-Indian whether to the United Kingdom or to any other country involving a journey to a port outside Asia; subject to the condition ^hat in the case of Journeys other than to the T T nitec' T ingdom, the extent of Government assistance shall be limited by adopting £ 76 as the maximum cost of a sea passage and £ 150 as the maximum cost of an air passage* 2* The concessions have been granted in respect of leave taken under the Key Leave Scheme. The object of that scheme is to encourage officers to take leave in order to fit them for another spell of duty, and the period for recuperative purposes has been fixed at 4 months exclusive of the ti'ne spent on travelling. It at the discretion of the Oovernment of India or for medical reasons an officer is granted more than four months' leave and is returning to India at the end of his leave, the concessions will be admissible. They will not apply to leave taken preparatory to retirement. If an officer is granted less than 4 months' leave^ it will be a question for decision by the Government of India on the merits of each case whether the concessions should be granted. The question for decision is whether it is in the Government s interests, for example, to pay the air passage both ways minus £ 76 in order to give an officer 6 weeks' leave In the nlted Kingdom. As regards officers serving under the Cs^ral Government, it has been ruled that the question whether concessions should be granted in a particular case is a matter for decision by the Finance Department and the Department under whom the officer is serving, in consultation; it is not a matter for the Home Department as administering the key leave scheme. 3. The concessions have been expressed in terms of what the officer will be charged. This charge, whatever it is f should be debited to his passage account. Where the passage account has been exhausted, the officer must pay the charge in cash; or, where the passage account is insufficient to meet the charge, the officer must make good the deficiency in cash. As regards officers who have already taken leavej their passage accounts should be adjusted accordingly. If because his passage account was exhausted or insufficient an officer paid in cash, in whole or in part, for his homeward and return journeys, any expenditure in cash above the a ount / chargeablechargeable to him under the concessions should now be refunded to him. To give an example under concessions (b), if the homeward and outward voyages cost a total of £ 140, which the officer met from his own pocket, he is entitled to recover £ 70 from the Government, If, of the £ 140, £ 100 was met from his passage account, his passage account should be credited with £ 30 and ne should be refunded £ 40.

Enquiries have been made about ho&gt;' long the key leave programme will continue. The position is that all officers entitled to passage benefits under the Superior Civil Services Regulations should h* allowed one period of key leave. The majority of sucn officers will probably have taken lea've by the end of 1946 but there may be some cases where for personal or administrative reasons they have postponed leave until 1947* It has therefore been decided to keep the scheme and the connected leave concessions open during 1947 also. Any officer offered key leave in 1947 with adequate notice who refuses to accept will have his name removed from the list of officers due for key leave. . C. WF ■*/«*)&gt;1^ .'
