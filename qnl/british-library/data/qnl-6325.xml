Three hundred and fifty sheep which were bein&amp; brought by a Kuwait merchant from Zubair were plundered a little to the north of J .hrah on the 1st February by twelve men. There is little doubt that the robbers were ’UralbdSr of Kuwait who had heard in the town that the sheep were coming. The owner asked the Shaikh to have them followed, but he refused to do so, on the ground that the robbers were more probably Ibn Sa’ud’s subjects, nd contented himself with writing a letter to the commander of Ibn Sard's detachment in the desert.

Ref. this Office report of 21/2/25, para.9. large numbers of SHAJ.2.1AR raiders appear to have concentrated at (JAISUIIA (200 miles S.W. of SAMAWAIi) early in February. A force of two or three banners, under ADWAH IBR RIMMAL, IBN KKUMSAN, and IBN DAIIAILAH proceeded to raid the TRAITS-JORDAN tribes in the WADI SIRHAN area. Another force N under 3JIDA IBN MUIIAIYIR and NRAIH AL HAIIZI moved north to raid the Iraq shepherds. Meanwhile, however, orders had been issued by IBN SAUD, prohibiting further raiding against the IRAQ. A message to this effect was therefore despatched after IBN MOHAIYIR. As a result, the latter turned back, but AL HAMZI refused to do so. First reports received alleged that messengers had overtaken IBN RIM3IAL, with orders to return. This report probably referred to IBN JCUI-IAIYIR. 2. RAID BY FRAIH AL HAIIZI. AL HAMZI, with a force of about two hundred camel men and twenty five horse men, raided two tents of the GKAZALAT tribe near SAI1IT on 19/2/25. On 24/2/25, he was about to attack another camp of the same tribe near the WADI UBAIYIDH (west of NAJF), when a patrol of D.H.9.A*s passed close by. Although the machines failed to locate the raiders, yet the lattert Or£~ 6 immediately droke off the flight and heat a hasty retreat, taking only five tents and about Seventy sheep as loot. SINCERITY OF IBN SAUIPS PROTESTATION. The sincerity of IBN SAND’S orders to the AKHWAN forbidding raiding, will be apparent from the action taken against ERAIH AL HAMZI. There can be no doubt, from unanimous reports that IBN SAUD, in the autumn, had given permission to the AKHWAN to raid IRAQ. That permission appear now to have been withdrawn. Should IBN SAUD genuinely desire to enforce the prohibition against raiding he vrill severly punish AL HAMZI. It is interesting to note that, in the case of the unauthorized raids by MUTAIR against the AWAZIM, severe punishment has in every case beenmoted out to the aggressors (see para 5.below)• It is difficult to accept IBN SAUD’S protestations as genuine, until he orders similar punitive action against such as attack IRAQ. ACTIVITIES. MUHD. IBN MIJLAD. Ref. this Office report of 21/3/25. para.11. Confirmation has been received to the effect that MUHD IBN MIJLAD is camped with the SINJARA DIVISION of SIIAHMAR west of the HAZUL, and that he, with JAID IBN MIJLAD, recently visited the governor of HAIL. PUNISHMENT OF MUTAIR RAIDERS. Ref. this Office report of25/1/25, para 1. It is reported that MASHARI IBN BUSAYYIS, after his raid on the AWAZIM of KOWAIT, despatchedmessengers to RIYADH to inform ABDUL RAHMAH1 IB1T SAUD of Ms success. It is stated that IBU SAUD iramediateiy imprisoned the messengers and confiscated their camels. At the same time, he ordered ABDULLA IB1T JILUWI, the governor of HASA, to return the loot. Accordingly ABDULLA’s negro slave, ABU SAID, with a force o± one hundred camel men, and accompanied hy a representative of the Shaikh of KUWAIT proceeded to THAUAMI (200 miles S.W. of BASRA) to recover the loot from MUTAIR. AKHWAH INTENTIOUS. An internal struggle would appear to he in progress in 1TAJD* There can he no douht that IBU SAUD, last autumn, gave his sanction to raiding against IRAQ, and that, as a result, AKHWAH tribesmen were looking forward to a record season of looting. Raiding has now heen officially forbidden, apparently much to the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen. There is now no doubt that DHAIDAU IBU HITHLAIU (AJILAU) recently reached AL LUSAKA (190 miles s.s.w. of BASRA)* with a large force destined to raid the IRAQ tribes and that he was turned back by orders from IBU JILUWI. Simultaneously as reported above, SIIAiniAR set out to raid but were overtaken by orders forbidding them to proceed. Some of them obeyed these orders and spine did not. Rumours of an intended raid by the DOWISH have again emanated from KOWAIT recently. MOVEIMTS. KOWAIT TRIBES . An unconfirmed report states that the Shaikh of KOWAIT recently informed the nomad tribes which folloyr him that he was unable to protect them from AKHWAN aggression. As a result, it is statad that they have all moved south across the KOWAIT - HASAfrontier, with the object of joining the AKHWA1I, LOCATIONS. AKHWAH TRIBES. TRAVELLERS RECENTLY ARRIVED report that there are now no camps north of the BATIN or west of tiie DAIiAlIA* It appears that there is a general idea current amongst the AKHWAN that hombs do not burst in soft sand. For this reason, 1-UTAIR and HARE have pitched their tents in the BAHAMA, sand belt. SHAMAR, ABBAH and ASLAM division^ are scsixt acfcddDExiaamc in the SHAIB PAIHAJJ area, 50 miles S.W. of JTJMAIMA..

The shepherd tribes which paid toll to the AKHWAN this winter have now all returned to IRAQ, territory. SHAKHAT IBM JAHIL (ZAIYAD) is camped about thirty miles vrest of the SULMAMSADOT ABU GHIGH (AJIB) is near WAKSA, and DRAIWAL IBN KEALAWI ( ZAIYAD) is thought to he in the vicinity of HAKAI AL BARBUS. 11 . TRIBAL LOCATIONS. ALIARAT AREA . BAHAD BEG IB1I IiABxIDIiAL is caraped on the WADI UBAIYIDH, 130 miles west of 1TAJB. It was his intention to move south to the LUSUB area, hut after the recent rains he will now prohahly return to the north. Since the Akhwan raid under BRAIH AL HAMZI, there are now no shepherd trioes south of the VADI UBAIYIDH. The majority of BAHT HASAN and HAITI 3ALATAH are north of that valley or have fled to the TUKTUIUIANA-} SHITATA area. MOVEMENTS. SIIAiBIAR NAJP OB THE JAZIRAH.

I understand from the Administrative Inspector, Baerah, that the Safwan - Zubair section presents no difficulties. I have given a copy of this Report to the Administrat ive Inspector, Basrah, and - as he is much interested in the possibility of using the road for oars - a modified trans lation to the Shaikh of Kuwait. I also enclose, also in triplicate, a modification of the above, rewritten in the form, and with the spellings, used in the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf by J.G.Lorimer, to take the place of Route II of the Article on 'Kuwait Prinoi- pali&amp;y' „ , u e draft of additions and alterations submitted witn my letter Nb.t 8 ?-C dated the 4 th November in case there be still any intention of bringing a* out the Revised edition which was then proposed. Major, Political Agent, Kuwait.DESCRIPTION OP THE ROUTE froa JAHRAH to SAFWlN* The distance from Jahrah Fort to SafwSn Wells Is 55 sixles. There is no water between the two places. The track is unmade, but clearly defined, and is practicable for motor and other wheeled traffic, though a car might experience some difficulty in ascending the steep and atony face of the «ral al•i&amp;h from the south, and also in crossing such dry sandy -ateroourses as cannot be avoided. To assist it in negotiating the latter, a car should carry strips of coir matting or wire netting, to spread in front of the wheels; or, if it were desired to open the road to motor traffic, this could probably be done most easily by laying a foundation of reed fascines to bear a roadway in each unavoidable water* course, A motor car would also very probably experience tyre trouble, owing to the very atony surface of a considerable portion of the route. The route leaves Jahrah in a north-westerly direction, and at | miles reaches the Mutla 1 Pass, * gap in the belt of low hills known as the Jal as-Zaur, between the TlutlS* hill on the east and the Mutaili»ah hill on tne west. This pass is not a serious obstacle to a car. The track follows the ▼alley called Jauf al-MutlS 1 till the plateau is reached at 5 miles. The route now turns north by east and runs in a straight line through the tracts of Zaqlah, OirS* al-Marru and y£h. 0 n this portion of the road the going is excellent. At 18 miles the Jal al-Y&amp;h is reached. This is a well-marked ridge running from east to west, fifty feet high and half a alle broad, covered srith round stones: to the south this rluge presents a rather steep face, but on the north it deollnes gradually to the level of the pUln. At a C alles a celt of huaaooky ground is Grossed, after *hioh the ^oine becomes good again. At « ailes the route enters the 8 ttlh district, anm ' U) undulating, perfectly waterless desert. At miles the''* A first of several sandy dry watercourses is crossed.This one, however, -vhich runs from west to east, is uite narrow, and presents no obstacle to a car. At miles the track enters a hummocky belt, which lasts for a little over a quarter of _ 0^) a mile. The road now ascends gently to ,'5 miles, where two • mounds,known as Kiseu adh-Dhabi, are passed on the right,and then descends gently, from this point running due north. At and miles three more dry sandy watercourses, run* ning, from west to east, are crossed. They are narrow,however, and not serious obstacles to a car. At miles, after a somewhat steep descent, a dry watercourse jq yards wide run ning from west to east is reached; its bed is of soft sand, and the ground immediately to the north of it is also rather difficult. It is not worth trying to avoid it, however, as to do so would entail making a very long detour. After dear th! s watercourse the road ascends sharply for a quarter of a mile. At miles a dry sandy watercourse, 5 o yards wide, with soft approaches, crosses the track. It is possible, however, to avoid this ?nd the four subsequent watercourses mentioned below, all of which run from west to east # by mak ing one detour of a mile and a quarter to the west, and keeping to the higher ground parallel to - and in si^ht of - the road for the next three miles. The ground thus traversed is extremely atony, but for a car it is the lesser of the two evil/;. The road itself crosses a ver&gt; soft watercourse 35 yards wide at 29i miles, and then a broad double water course 3c yard* wide at 2$% mile*. This is the longest of these five watercourses, and it is for it alone that the a*tour to wod them has to exceed a mile , Tbtroad then crosses one i^c yards wide at 3 o£ miles, and a very soft one 7 y. rda wide at 3U miles. After avoiding this last as described above, a o*r should Join the road again. -or tne next six miles the road is stony, except at 33 ^ —miles, where it crosses a sandy halt a quarter of § mile tor©ad covered with hummocks* At 37; miles, after a slight descent, the road enters a plain half a mile across with a hard mud surface. This normally affords excellent going for a motor car, out would be difficult after rain. It could then be avoided, however, by making a sli^nt detour to either side. At miles the top of the main Hamfir ridge is reached. At mile 38^ and gain at mile 4o narrow sandy belts covered with Ccael thorn are crossed. At mile 4 \^ a dry sandy water* course, 6 yards wide, running fro* east to west, is crossed; and at miles, one *4 yards wide running in a south westerly direction. At 43; miles the road begins to drop, and a oar should leave it, and for the next mile should keep to the high ground one mile to the west of it to *void three dry sandy watercourses which OLsasak cross It from west to east. The first of these is at mile 44-',, and is \o yards wide. Just to the west of the road a tributary watercourse nearly half a mile long joins It from the south, and this necessitates lenwixig the rood at the point recommended. The second of the three watercourses, at mile 44f, is quite narrow; and the third, at mile 44*,is only 3 yards wide. To the north of this last &amp; oar should again Join the road. At 46* miles a dry sandy watercourse, running from west to east, 14 yards wide with rather bad approaches, has to be crossed; a* and at 47£ miles, one running in the same direc tion K yards wide with hunmooky approaches. Prom 47 ? miler there is a steady drop to dafw&amp;n. The ground is now stony. At 48t miles a dry watercourse to yards wide running from west to east has to be crossed. Pour belts of soft, hum* oc fy eaeh a quarter of a mile broad, are crossed in the next t+iree miles, the rest of the road being very stony. At 51 J miles a double dry sandy watercourse, running from west to east, crossed. It is 33 yards broad, nd has hummocky ground ?or a oile to the north of it. At 33 Ailes the v ;ells of S fwaii. «ire re&amp;zhed-TO REPLACE ROUTE II of the Article on 'KUWAIT PRINCIPALITY' in the Draft Addition* and Alterations to the GAZETTEER OP THE PERSIAN GULP BY J. G.

MEMORANDUM. Reference ny memorandum N 0 . 8 I-S, dated 4th April 1925 . Shaikh Ahmad called on me yesterday afternoon, and told me that he had been discussing the possibility of opening the Jahrah - Zubair road for motor traffic with Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqlb (the brother of Saiyid TSlib Pasha and son of the late Naqlb of Basrah), and that he had ended by giving him a concession to form a company to make the road, in return for which it would have a monopoly of the Motor Trans port trade in Kuwait territory (i.e. as far as SafwSn) and fche right to levy tolls on other oars using the road. Saiyid Hamid Bey inherited the Kuwait portion of his father’s property, and now lives chiefly in Kuwait, but he also owns estates in Basrah, and frequently travels between the two places. I knew that he was very much Interested in % the Idea of using this road for oars, and that he was dls- ousslng with the Shaikh the possibility of getting something done to make It passable, but I had not realized that suoh an ambitious scheme as this was under consideration. Saiyid Hamid Bey has also been to see me. He says that whether the scheme ever actually materializes or not will of course have to depend on the prospects of Its being able to pay or not, and that he cannot tell what these prospects are until he has had estimates of the cost of road-making, etc., prepared. He says that he Is going to try the road himself with two or three oars In the beginning of May, and asked me If X would care to accompany him. I gave him no promise, but k .—p^... ** &amp; 0 ft I think it might be a good thing for me to go when the time cornea, aa I could at any rate obtain really accurate topo» graphical information about the route with the hodometer of my Ctir, and it would be Interesting to actually test with a Orir the opinions which I formed on my recent tour# Personally I am somewhat sceptical about ever seeing this scheme materialize, but If It does, I think It can do nothing but good to the town* I enclose herewith, im triplicate, a translation of the Motor Transport Concession. Article V is badly worded, as it grants a monopoly to this company 'in Kuwait territory', instead of on the way to ’IrSq alone, as I am sure was meant by both parties - whereas it is quite conceivable that there will be motor services to say H£il or QaeTm within fifty ye .rs# Another article which I do not altogether like is VII# MaJor # Political Agent, Kuwait.TRANSLATION OP MOTOR TRANSPORT OONGESSION.

No, 95 - 3 , XX XXX KUWAIT. 2 1 st April 1925 . I am very much Interested in your D.O, No ,160 of the I4th April and its enclosure, which $ave Just reached me this afternoon. Things have been moving fast at this end since I last wrote. The day before yesterday Shaikh Ahmad came round to call on me, and told me that he had feha:fcx]x&amp;x])tft&amp; granted a Motor Transport Concession to Saiyld Hamid. I knew, of course that they were discussing the opening of this road, but I never expected anything so pretentious as this Agreement (of which I enclose a translation) to evolve. As you will see, he has given Salyid Hamid a Motor Trans port monopoly of the part of the road in his territory, i.e. to Safwan exclusive,for a period of fifty ye jrs, with the right to levy tolls on private oars using it. I notice that in Saiyid Hamid’s Concession he can charge any fares he likes whereas ’Abdul Latlf Pasha in his application undertakes not to charge more than R 3 . 25 A - actually the fares will regu late themselves by the Khuwair route prices. I do not think there is any question of opposition between Saiyid Hamid and ’Abdul Latif, as when Saiyld Hamid first told me about his scheme he mentioned the Pasha’s name as either being in with him, or certain to oome in. A/ fricfi ^ / )y}^oc/K t A wyh-tXySaiyid H&amp;wid, who waa round seeing me yesterday, tells me that he is going to try the road with one or two oars soon after the ^d, and asked me if I would care to go along too. I did not give him a definite answer one way or the other, but, as we shall have to go up to Basrah in any case before the summer to do soma shopping, I think it is very probable that we take advantage of the opportunity and go by oar. It would be interesting to test my opinion about the road myself, and having just been over it I think we oould help Saiyid Hamid. It will probably mean a new set of tires, but there will be no B.I. fares or taxis in Basrah, so wfcat we loose on the swings we’ll gain on the roundabouts. I can not get away from here before the tat Kay at the earliest myself, so if we do oome it will probably be on the 2nd or 3rd. Do you think you could put us up for a few days then - about, but not more than, a week? Do not hesitate to say so if it is inconvenient. If you know now that you cannot take us, I shall be very grateful if you will send me a wire on receipt of this, but do not bother otherwise until you hear again. If we do come we will send a servant with our luggage by B.I. or the Khuwair to be ready for us.CONFIDENTIAL. To The Hon*ble the politioal Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E. Motor Transport Conoosaion, MEMORANDUM. Reference my merooranduni No. 91 -S, dated 2 Cth April &lt; 925 , I enclose herewith a oopy of a decii-official letter, No .160 dated 14th April 1925 ,(and of its enclosure), from Major W. C. F. Wilson, Administrative Inspector, Basrah, regarding an application from * Abdul Lat.ff Pasha al-Mandll to the Government of ‘Iraq for a Concession for the ‘Iraq portion of this road^which reached me yesterday afternoon. There is not, I think, any question of rivalry between the two, as when Saiyid H&amp;mid Bey first spoke to me of the abstract idea of forming a company to run cars on this road, he said he knew he could get ‘Abdul Latff Pasha to come in with him if he did. xhe clause about limiting fares to Rs. 25 /- a seat seems hardly necessary, as the fares will have to be limited by the competition of the Khuwair Launch route.

GOl^lTTS, , Pi^jTG UP i'O Previoua to the year I92o f the principa lity of IB 1 T ItASKID was situated between the IPA$ and the territory of I BIT GAUD. In that year, IBi: SAUD finally overthrew I BIT RASHID and annexed his territory, thus becoinng a neighbour of IRAQ. Although the Aidman tribesmea were desirouu of extending their raids to the IRAQ, further hostilities might have been avoided by arrangements between I BIT BAUD and the BRITISH. At this juncture, however, IB1T SAUD* s bitterest rival, the Sliarif PAISAL, was roade hing of IRAQ. Other minor causes of friction also remained unsettl The IRAQ tribes were in an awlcword \-ed. dilenma. Their government was unable to protect them from raiding, nor would it allow them to come to pri- -vate terns with the Aldiwan. AJdR,AlT In I9R5, a handful of tribesmen,fleeing from the anger of IB1T 3A T JB, to oh refuge in IRAQ. They received a favourable reception from KI1TCT RAX SAL, and thereupon embariced on a succession of raids against the AIHILAIT, their former masters. s Probably largely as a reprisal for these attack a strong force under PAX SAL AL BOV'I SRI raided the IRAQ tribes near UITSAB, in March, 1924. Raids by refugees against the Aiduran continued uninterrupted during the summer of 1924. As a result, those m touch with the situation foresaw that retalia- -tery attacks on an unprecedented scale, would take place during the winter 1924-5. Government, however, were slow to realise the critical nature of the situation, and up to the end of December,1924, practically no defensive measures had been taken. The storm then burst. These heavy raids were delivered along ^the length of the frontier, betvfeen -• 2G/l. 2 / 2 4 and 12/1/25. By good fortune, two of these raids were overtaken by aircraft.Defensive measures were theNadopted in all haste, and a note of protest was despatched to IBJT BAUD. This note, combined with reports of aerial activity in the desert, caused IBJT SATJD to prohibit the AiCKWAK from further aggression. banwhile, however, a fresh wave of raiders were concentrating near the frontier. IBS' SAIJD’s prohi bition arrived in time to prevent the second wave fr©m— attacking, with the exception of one party under FRAIK AL IIAMZI, The presence of concentrations near the frontier, however, maintained the whole desert in a constant state 01 alarm throughout Pebruary. The month of March was quieter. The opportunity was taken to curry out a good deal of topographical work.ON DNTENSIVE 0PEIU f i?I0N3 AGAINST TNS AKE'JM / IN TEH 1924-1923. PART I. NAHHATIVE.

The Southerly was governed By ABDUL A2IZ IBN SAND. In the summer of 1920, IBN SAUD finally captured the town of HAIL and overthrew the principality of IBN RASHID. Prom this time onwards the frontiers of his WAHHABI state marched with those of IRAQ* 2 . 3» THE AKH.7AN SEEN.

The overthrow of IBN RASHID left the northern triBes of Central A^aBia 'Without an objective excepting the subjects of IRA^# Panaticsm was added to greed as an incentive to the AKHITAN to raid the IRAQ tribes, owing to the difference in their religious sect. The nearest IRAQ triBes were SHIAHS, the people of CENTRAL ARABIa were fanatical WAHHABIS, calling themselves AKHITAN (the Brethren). TRIBES OP THE PRONTIER AREA . T .7hile the tribe of CENTRAL ARABIA are invariably owhers of camels, those nomads which own allegiance to the IRAQ are of two classes. (a) Pure Bedouins. These men are entirely camel owners and spend nearly the whole year in the high desert* They also form potential raiders. Being camel i*ji tim'i'uftl) capable of covering vast distance across the desert. B. Shepherd tribes* The wealth of these tribes lies in their flocks of sheep* while they also maintain a number of donkeys and horses for transport purposes. not possessing camels, they are unable to raid as bedouins do. Moreover, their sheep and donkeys being unable to bear thirst like camels, they are obliged to spend the summer and autumn on the river banks. as soon as the rains begin to fall, however, usually in December, they move out into the desert to graze their sheep on the grass- which appears there in sx:ring. In april they return to the river again for the summer. These shepherd tribes with their rich flocks and their inability to retaliate owing to the lack of camels, form the most tempting objective for the atcttitan. The majority of the latters r raids is therefore delivered during the grazing season from December to AP ri l v5 OBdJAOLE 10 PEACE. After the fall of HAll, the predatory tribesmen of OEHfRAl ARABIA soon commenced to turn their attention to the invasion of IRAQ. TM BAUD* however, had been up to that time, in receipt of British pay, and felt a wholesome respect for British power, which was paramou.it in IRAQ* Had this state of affairs endured, it is probable that serious raids by the AKHFfAN would never have occurred. At this juncture, however, FAISAL I BN HUSAIU, the son of IBM SAUD T s bitterest rival, was appointed King of IRAQ. Shortly afterwards, also, IBM SAUD ! s salary was discontinued. HOSTILE IMELUEMQE OE KIHfl EAISA1. It cannot be cause for surprise, that the arrival of Kingimparted to the Grovernmoat, an anti-AKOTAU 'bias which would not otherwise have existed. There was, at bottom, no cause whatever for hostility between the AKHV/AK and the new IRA4 State* prom time immemorial, the 'Teak: shepherd tribes had been wont to conciliate the good will of the great desert chiefs by the annual payment to them of a toll in sheep* In Turkish days, IBM 1-ASHIB was the usual recipient of these perquisites, which were winked at by the authorities. /hen, with the overthrow of IBM BASHID, IBM S^.UD T s influence extended to the IRAM frontier, several IRA &lt;4 tribes made advances to his represenatives, with a view to the payment of this toll. The anti-AKHWAN bias of the new IKAQ Groverrment was, however, soon illustrated by the penalties inflicted on such shaikhs as had come to agreements of this nature* The IRAQ (xovernmait was not at the time in a positioi to defend its subjects from AKHVfAR agression. Thus, for a period of three years, the IRAQ tribes were neither protected by their own GrOvernment, nor permitted to propitiate the power which was threatening them, PEGULIAR TERMORS OP AKE1IAR RAlBi. It is frequently asked why nomad A*abs, who have been accus tomed to raid and be raided for untold centuries should now suddenly require government protection. The answer is two-f4Id; (a) According to old juab custom, tribes raid each other for loot, as few casualties as possible being inflicted. The AKMAN have inaugurated a new policy of conquest - they kill in cold blood all males of over about 8 years of age* (t) In the natural course, terrified by this ferocity, the IRAQ tribes would have secured their immunity by a pay~ ment of tribute. The IRAQ Government, however, punished such Shaikhs as adopted this course*THE IK^AIR OOHFSRIiiUGS* In November, 1922 , a conference was held at uqATR, on the PEESlAEf (JUIF, between air perc^r Oox, I BN BAUD, and a repre sentative of the IRAQ Government. negotiations, however, broke dovrn, on the question of the extradition of a number of tribes, formerly subjects of I BE RASHID, who had emigrated to the IRAQ after the fall tff HAIL* THE JOT,7AN REFUGEES . In the summer of 1923, a disgruntled IRAQ Shaikh, YUSUP BEG Al MANSUR, visited I BN BAUD, by whom he was accorded a favourable reception. AKHVIAN and IRAQ tribes were at the time peacefully encamped near the frontier. Trading on the prestige acquired by his friendly intercourse with IBN BAUD, YUSUP BEG suddenly raised a force of AKH7AN bedouins, and crossing the frontier, raided the IRAQ tribe of the DHAPIR. IBN BAUD immediately sent to punish the offenders, with the result that YUSUP BEG and his raiders threw themselves on the mercy of the IRAQ Government, whose subjects they had just raided. INGEPPIQN OP RAIDING BY THE REPUGEES . There is little cause for surprise if King PAISA1, when created ruler of IRAQ, should have conceived the idea of enlisting the services of that country against IBN BAUD, the bitterest enemy of his house. The IRAQ tribes, however, were desirous only of peace. .YUSUP BEG refugee raiders,/however, had many of /T7 ////£&gt; themarrived^in a state of destitution, and were anxious, by raiding, to replace their lost possessions. Vfhat could be more satisfactory than to raid the followers of IBN BAUD, Whose anger had driven them from their homes ? howalso, could such raiding against his bitterest enemy fail to please King FAISA 1 ?• From the autumn of 1923 onwards, the refugees, smiled on by the King, embarked on a steady policy of raiding against the AKthTU:!, from the shelter of IRAQ territory# SVRrfS OF 'HR GIUZixJG SS-iAGH, 1923-24 . At the commencement of the 1923-24 grazing season, the IRAQ tribes moved out with a certain amount of confidence, and mingled with aKHVIAR subjects in the vicinity of the frontier. During the autumn and winter, however, the frequest attacks delivered by the refugees began to cause considerable resentment amongst the AKKWAR* Finally, in March 1924, FAISAX AX DO WISH with a large AKHWAN force suddenly crossed the frontier and heavily raided a concentration of IRAQ tribes and bedouins near UHSAB. The remaining IRAQ nomads fled in panic to the banks of the Euphrates, DEFENSIVE i-iRAiURIiia OF 1923^24. preliminary warning of an impending ASWfM raid had been received before FAlAAl IX D0\7lHH T s attack. a hasty system of aerial, patrolling of the desert was improvised, but was unsuccessful in repulsing the raiders. ANII-BRIgloH PROPAGANDA, For the past ten years, IB1I 3AUD has b eon universally reputed to be an ally of the British. fhosm when raided by his followers, the IRAQ nomads were universally convinced that these ££ attacks were being connived at, or even encouraged, by the British. Considerable bitterness was aroused by 4 this illusion, a feeling which was sedulously fostered by certain anti-British propagandists. i^hese sentiments reached their climax, after the KHVISH's raid of uarch 1924 .1 3» Qg UP SD 'HE aUIvIMSR OP 1924.

Raiding by the refugees against the AKHVfAH continued uninterrupted during the summer of 1924* [There oan now be little doubt that, during this period, the AKHWAN bedouins were 'saving up' their resentment, and preparing counter raids on an unprecedented scale as soon as the opening of the shppherd grazing season afforded them a suitable objective. I I 2 . 3- aUBMiaalOB Off PRQPSAL3 FOR UIWQS. Those in touch with bedouin affairs were able to •foresee something of the storm which was brewing. In October 1924 , the then 3.3.0. Id wan i yah submitted a scheme for anti~AKH : M defence, for the forthcoming season. The main recommendations were; (a) The appointment of a special 3.3.0* solely for anti«AKHV/AN defensive work* (b) During periods of alarm, the mustering of the IRAQ tribes in areas suitable for defence. (o) While the alarm lasted, the carrying out of daily aerial patrols along the front of the IRAQ trices, (d) The establishment of an advanced post in the desert, at ABU GEAR, for the collection of intelligence, and the maintenance of advanced bombs and petrol stores* P R00RA3 TINATIQR3. Authorities in Baghdad, however, were slow to realize the critical nature of the situation. Eventually, in | December, by which time all defensive preparations should have been already completed, a party of officers were instructed to reconnoitre the desertby armoured oar and report. A Special S*S.O* AKH.TAN Defence was in the meanvhilt appointed, but, in the absence of other defensive preparation*: he found himself almost helpless. !£HE BURSflpa Q$ fHS S(gQlM&gt; A succession, of early rainstorms had tempted the IRAQ oribes into the desert, and by mid-December they had had already reached a line ULLul RAHAl —' SiJXii'.iAIT w&gt;iriaRAF• At trie same time, further ominous- reports of raid preparations by the DOVISH were heard. Finally, on Dec. 2b, a force of AKHMJ raiders, several thousand strong, under ABDUL A^I2 *Jj DO WISH (kUTAIR) attacked the IHA^ shepherd tribes at the JIRAIBIYAT* By good fortune, the S.3.0. arrived on the site during the action and was able to carry back nev.f3 of the raid. ^s a result, on 28 / 12/24 and 29 / 12 / 24 , machines from 84 squadron, SHAIBAH, were able to overtake and bomb the raiders. Six days later, on January lst. 1925 , another AKHWAU force under MAH3IH AL FIRM suddenly descended on the IRAQ tribes near HADDAtflYAH, inflicting heavy casualties and looting sheep and other property. As information of this raid reached government until five days later, little hope was then entertained of overtaking the raiders, but a patrol of D«H&lt;*9«A TS was sent out to locate and cross-question the survivors. So futile, however, had been government’s defensive measures in the past that the raiders on this occasion appear to have been supremely self-confident. The patrol in its search for fugitives suddenly discovered the whole raiding force still encamped in tents on the scene of the xi o^t, and were able, on three succasBive n *&gt; s ,to bomb thorn, with good effect* On IZ/l/Z 1 }* a third raid under IBU BU3AYYIS feil upon the IRAQ shepherds in the neighboorhoo d of BEAR AH'* Ho information of this raid reached government till long afterwards 5* RBoULf OR THE FIRST 1/AVS OR RAlIfr . Thus, while government were still disousaing academic schemes, the actual storm had burst. Three heavy raids had been delivered and the surviving IRAQ tribes had fled back in panic almost to the river bank* By good fortune, two of the raids had been overtaken by aircraft, but it was not considered that casualties had been inflicted on a scale sufficient to prevent further raids* as a result it was thought necessary to maintain the IRAQ tribes mustered on the line UMM RAHAL - BIRAIBICH, /here, owing to lack of grazing, they suffered severe losses in live stock. 6 . ADOPT I OH OF DEgBHaiVR HEASURES * - This putburst of raidss?^ had the effect of galvanizing the R»A#P» and the IRAQ Government. The B.S^s original proposals for awrial patrols were sanctioned, and on 20/1/25, ABU GEAR was occupied as an advanced post. There can be little doubt 1 that, had these measures been taken early in December, such heavy punishment could have been inflicted on the first raids as would have ensured the safety of the frontier for the rest of the year. 7. PHO TEST 'TO IBH BAUD * At the same time, a strong diplomatic protest was despatched to IM BAUD by H.E* the High Commissioner for IRAQ* As it subsequently appeared, the reception of this note, coupled with that of simultaneous reports of aerial action against the raiders, decided IBH BaUD to withdraw the permission which hehad formerly granted to the j&amp;K'mi tribes to raid the IRAQ. Although the casualties inflicted by the aerial action against the raiders had been few, considerable consternation had undoubtedly been caused by the appearance of aerial patrols along the frontier from the 3AfII;I to JULLAILIA. Ihe AKRV'/AH began to fear aerial reprisals on their camps in their own grazing grounds. fHS SEOQiJD WAVE Off HAIRS , scarcely had the first wave of raiders returned to their homes, than a secong wave commenced to concentrate in the frontier area. In the middle of January, a force under MASEARI IBS BU&amp;AYYIo (MUTAIB) moved up to the frontier in the BA I IE area. On reaching the latter, however, he turned east, and raided tribes subject to the shaikh of K0I7AH. Boon afterwards, a large force under IEAIIAN IBLI HITHLAIH (AJMAR) assembled at AL 1USAFA ( 140 miles s.'/* of K0JAI3!, and was thought to be about to cross the IRAQ front!er. At the end of January, large concentrations of raiders of the AHAMMAR tribe collected at GAISUMA, l 8 o miles B. r* of SAMARAS. Uncertainty as to their objective maintained the whole front in a state of unrest throughout the month of Februaru. Several reasons, however, appeared to indicate the possibility of their raiding tribes near the 17ADI UBAIYIIK, and as a result aerial patrols were extended to that area also. BISBmillUflQII OF im S AU D T p BOHIBI AT VIP ORDBRB # Alarmed at the intervention of the British aerial forces, IBIJ BAUD had meanwhile issued hasty orders to all AKHTAN leaders, prohibiting further agression against the IRAQ. fhe orders arrival in time to prevent the second wave of raiders f, 0 mv attaoking, with the exoaptionx of one SRAMMAR party under Fii a IF JJj EiEZl (iilITJAHA) . These raided two small IIU.4 samps, one at T (90 miles 3•7* of JiJAF) * the other near EjaKHAIB (100 miles 3*l?* of BAJS 1 )* Machines were at the time actually patrolling the area, and on two occasions flew within sight of the raiders. Contradictory intelligence reports, however, created a false impression of the situation, and the basic principle of patrolling the advanced IRA^ Gamps every day during the alarm, was neglected. as a result, the raiders were missed. The proximity of the machines, however, unnerved the AKHvTAH, who beat a hasty retreat with very little loot. 10 . PEACBPU1 GLOSS Off THE 3BA30N . prom about March Ist.omwards the situation in the desert gave less cause for anxiety. I BN 3AU!D T s prohibitive orders were ioiovm to have been communicated to all aKHWAN leaders, AS a result, flying was largely reduced, being limited to long distance demonstrations by three machines about twice a week, in the frontier area. The object of these flights was to remind short-xxredsdx memoried bedouins that Government was still in earnest, and also to give confidence to the IHA-A tribes, who were still a prey to constant fears. It was essaitial also, in case of fresh alarm, to remain in close touch with the locations of the IRA^ nomads. 11. RAIDS BY TEE KkPUGEES AGAINST THE ahiiVfAN . The creation of an atmosphere of p-eace and mutual confidmce in the frontier area, was rendered almost impossible by the continued petty raids delivered by the refugees against the AKHWAN* These attacks contin ing as they did throughout the whole winter, even after the issue of IBN SAUD’s prohibition against raids by the AKH7AN, created considerable bitterness southof the frontier. r j?he AKHIM believed * i oountenanoed by the British. these raids to be 12 . rOBQGrHA 2 HI OaL v l) ii)i. Operations in the desert had throughout been much hampered by the lack of reliable maps and the paucity of landmarks. j?he lull of active operations during Harsh 1925 * enabled a certain amount of ^vork to be carried out in this directior. A theodolite traverse yas carried out through the area within forty miles of the Hailway and river, v/hile a number of points at a greater distance were fixed by solaa observations, the observer being flown out to the site and landed. At the same time topographical information regarding minor features in the advanced area was collated by the b.3.0. on his tours and by Arab reports.AUP ^ D-J DU GTIGITS. SIi;CTIQ^ I # POLICY. (I) lii^ CIiiSS I ? Y OP AC TI PIT« The chief consideration \/hich necessitated the adoption of defensive measures against the AFHWAIT uas the strong anti-British propaganda to which the previous raids had given rise. Nomad tribesmen from JERUSALEM to KUWAIT were convinced that the BRITISH were betraying them by conniving at, if not be directly encour- -aging, the AKHWAH inroads. The defensive measures talc on after the first raids were so obviously genuii le that . this libel was very nearly discredi* -ted amongst the IRAQ nomads , though it occasion* -ally reappeared amongst the river dwellers. There can be little doubt that, but for the adoption of these measures, nit a single IRAq tribe could have ventured into the desert h* at all, and that, as a result, their anti-British resentment would have reached a climax. ( 3 ) ALV AITTAG-ES Off BI PLOiiAT IC , AC^IQEh It cannot be too oi ten repeated that military measures are but a - last resource. Although the threat of aerial actio is a useful, if not an indispensable, aid to diplomacy, yet the latter is the only method of- securing the complete immunity of the IRAQ tribes irom being raided. The vast areas to be covered-'’ render it impossible to guarantee that the raiders will always be repulsed* At one same time, the necessary concentration of the IRAQ tribes in tne zones best suited for defence frequently conflicts witn tneir grazing requirements, and tHereby causes them considerable hardship SgpjBbdlTY—CT._hAR:,Y _Hlhi : ARATICICS.

In the event of further serious desert operations, however, a scheme for their use might be elaborated. They might for example be based on the advanced post, or they could set out on an operation accompanied by a Vernon loaded with petrol. All machines could land in the desert before coming into action, and the Snipes refill with petrol from the Vernon.

Th# distanct from JahrsCh Port to Safwaa Wella la 35 milta, and from Safwan to Zubalr miles. There la no waltr between Jahrah and Safwan, The track is unmade, but clearly defined, and is practicable for actor and other wheeled traffic. It would be advisable however for motor care to deviate from the road as suggested below until such time as a regular motor road is constructed. At present a car would very probably experience tyre trouble, owing to the very atony surface of a considerable portion of the route. The route leaves Jahrah in &amp; north-westerly direction, and at 3 allies reaches the ffutlS 1 Pass, a gap in the belt of low hills known as the Jal aa-Zaur or the Jahai Ghadhai, between the Mutia* hill on the east and the Mutalli'ah hill on the west. This pass is not a serious obstacle to a car. The track follows the valley called Jauf al-iffutlS 1 till the plateau is reached at 5 miles. The route now turns north by east, and runs in a straight line through the tracts of Zaqlah, Qira* al-Marru and ':Sh. On this portion of the road the going is excellent. At miles the JS 1 al-Xah is reached. This is a well marked ridge running from east to west, fifty feet high and half a mile broad, covered with round stones* to the south this ridge presents a somewhat steep face, though not a serious obstacle to motor traffic, but on the north it declines gradually to the level of the plain. At 20 1 - miles a belt of huasocky ground is crossed, after which the going becomes good again. At miles the route entere the district of the Abatih (which, although not now generally understood, means ’’sandy watercourses*, being the plural of Abt&amp;h ). This ie an undulating, perfectly waterless desert. At 2 ;^ miles 7 the A first of the dry sandy watercourses from which the Abatih takes its name. This one, however is quite narrow, and“) / 3 S' pr®a«nt» no obstacle to &amp; car. At 24 alles the traok enters a hums&amp;oky belt which lasts for a little over a quarter of a aile. The road now ascends gently to 24 } miles where two mounds # known as Hissu adh-Dhabi, are passed on the right, and then descends gently, from this point running due north. At 25 j, 26 , and 26 $ milea three more dry sandy watercourses, running from east to west, are crossed. They are narrow, however, and not serious obstacles to a oar. At 2 ?J miles, after a somewhat steep descent, a dry watercourse 6o ya de wide running from west to east Is reached; its bed is of soft sand, and the ground immediately to the north of it is also rather difficult. At 20 miles a dry sandy watercourse, pq * yards wide, running fro® west to east, with soft approaches, is crossed. At 2^ miles the road crosses a very soft urn sandy watercourse, 33 yards wide, also running fro® west to east, and then a broad double one 5 c yards wide at jq miles. The road then crosses one 2 o yards wide at 3of miles, and another, 7 yards wide but very soft, &amp;t 3 * miles. These also run from west to east. For the next six miles the road is itony, except at 33 j miles, where it crosses a sandy belt a quarter of a mile broad covered with huci&lt;aocks. jfVxffl ft 111, At 37 i miles , after a slight descent, the road enters a plain half a mile across wi$h a hard aud surface. This normally affords excellent going for a motor car, but would be difficult after rain, though it could then easily be avoided. At present motor cars should proceed along the route described above until they have crossed the Y 3 h tract. Then, at mile 23, they should leave it and, bearing to the east, work round the ten watercourses described above, and come back to the road again at the plain described above, at 37% miles. This detour only adds some three or four miles to the distance, on coming back to the road at 3 ?| miles, oars should cross it and immediately bear off to the west of it * ma oai y adjoin it again at Safwln. By doing this only three ai - Ua • r# add * d th * dlataao., and nine watereouriM aadescribed, below, are avoided.

At 44;- miles and at 44} aUes two more small watercourses, running from west to east, are crossed; the former is quite narrow, and the latter only 3 /pis vide. At 46} miles a dry sandy watercourse, running from west to east, |4 yards wide with rather bad approaches, is crossed; and at 4 ?} miles, one running in the same dlreo- tion yards wide with hummocky approaohes. From 47 } miles there is a steady drop to Safwan. The ground is now stony.At 48 } miles a dry watercourse to yards wide running from west to east, sbur belts of soft, hummocky ground, each a quarter of a mil* broad, are crossed in the next three mllee, the intervening ground being very stony. At d. miles a double dry sandy watercourse running from west to east is crossed; U is 35 yards wide, and has soft, hummocky ground for half . aile to the north of it. At 55 miles the well, 0 f S.fwSn are reached, where good water is available at l 5 feet. As stated above, car. should rejoin the ro&amp;d here. There is an alternative route via ftash'SaTyah, a little over ten miles south-east by south of S.fwaa, where there are six -ell. 0 f good water, and thence to 3 afwan, but this is little used, and is certainly not recommended for motor traffic.

This pass is not a serious obstacle to a motor car. The track follows the valley called Jauf-al-Mutll* LPjf, till the plateau is reached at 5 miles. The route now turns north by east, and run« in a straight lin# through the tracts of ZAQLAH IPs Qiri’-al.flAHRU^/l? and YAH ^ 0 . On this portion of the road the going is exoe] lent, /t .19 miles the JSl-al-. Xah oV'M is reached: this i* a well marked ridge running from east to west, fifty feet high and half a mile broad, covered with round stones, fo the south this ridge presents a rather steep face, but on the north it declines graduall to the level of the plain. It Is easily passable for motor traffic. At 23 alias the routs enters the district of the ABATIH 4^1^* an undulating perfectljr waterless desert, traversed from west to east by a series of slight ridges, of which tne largest is the KaniSr^l^to the north, and als by a series of dry sandy water ooxirses, from which latter the district takes its name.At 24 J miles two mounds called the - Hi sau-adh-Dhabi \y»&gt; are passed. During the*first four miles of the Abatih four dry watercourses are crossed, but they are small and do not fom a serious obstacle to motor or other wheeled traffic.At axles, however, after a some what steep descent,the road crosses a dry watercoursefay {0:/ #c yards wide, niilhing from weat to east; its bed Is of soft sand and the ground immediately to the north of it Is also rather dif ficult.At miles the track crosses a dry watercourse,50 yards wide with oad approaches, also running from west to east. The next four watercourses, all running from west to east, ares- a very soft one,35 yards wide,at 29! miles, one 30 yards wide at 30 miles, one yards wide at miles, and a very soft one 7 yards wide at miles.For the next six miles the road is very a stony except for two narrow sandy belts. At 37« miles it enters a plain half a mile across, with a hard mud surface,which would be difficult for motor traffic after rain, but could then be avoided. At present, and until such time as a proper motor road be made, oars should proceed along the raw route described above until they have crossed the YSh tract. Then, at 23 miles, they should leave it and, bearing to the east, work round the ten watercourses draunel described above. They should come back to the road on this plain, at 37g- miles, and immediately cross the road and bear off to the west of it, and only rejoin it again at Safwdn - by doing thii the nine watercourses enumerated below are avoided. These two detours only add about four and three miles respectively to the total distanoe.Jontinuing along the roadjUself, the top of the main Hamar range is crossed at miles. At miles a dry water* course 6 yards wide running from east to west, and at 42 $ miles one 14 yards wide running in a south-westerly direction are srat crossed. At 44 ^ miles the road, crosses a sandy watercourse run ning from west to east - as do tl next six - 1 o yards wide.

At 46 i miles it crosses 02 14 yards wide with bad approaches at 47 miles, one 4 c yards wide with hummocky approaches. From 4 ' miles there is a steady drop to Safwan, the ground being stony except where stated below. At 48 - miles a watercourse lo yards wid&lt; is crossed. In the next three at: miles the track crosses four ber of soft hummocky ground, each i mile broad.At 51 * a double dry sandy watercourse is crossed;it ; 35 yards broad,and has soft h ummocky aygiegagfraa ground for mile to the north of it. At 55 miles Safwan Is reached.Tho remainder of the route to Basrah is described in the article on 'IRAQ. 116 water is available between JAHBaH and SAFWSlf, and there is no reoosuised oampiae ground. The route is a tiring one, but not only is it much shorter, but it is also considered somewhat safer than Route 4N0. Z. It is practicable for motor and other wheeled traffic, but it is advisable for oars to make the detours recommended above to avoid having to cross the sandy watercourses. There is an alternative route to SafwSn, via the Qash’Snlyah y i » wells, a little over ten miles south-east by south of * SafwSn, where there are six wells of good water at feet.

I am sending you a revised description of the J&amp;hr&amp;h-Zubalr road, which show* you what I am satisfied is the boot way for oars at present, and the alignment on which I think a proper motor road could moat easily and cheaply be made. It is acre or less the way we came home the other day, but not exactly - we did not bear in to the west after getting round the watercourses of the AbStih and Join the road again at the north of the Yah as I now recommend, but kept on working south away to the east of the road and thereby let ourselves in for some rather nasty obstacles, covered 68’ miles fro- Sf.fwfn to Jahrah, instead of say 62-1 make the actual camel track 55 . Still, I was very pleased with what we saw on our return Journey, as there is no question now that quite a good motor road co^ld be made with remarkably little work or expense. Even as it is, if I had to go to Basrah to-morrow, 1 would go by car again rather than by B.I. As a matter of fact, the only trouble we had on our return trip was before we actually started: Saiyid H’traid and party were Just ahead of us as we left Basrah City, and when we got to Zubair we found that they had burnt out a be ring in one of his cars - they had been driving it far too f^st for a scrap-iron Ford. This meant sending back to Basrah, and it was ne rly sun set before we got away from Zubair, and we halted for the night about opposite RSfldhlyah, I m also sending you a copy of a memorandum from Sir Percy Oox dated ii&gt;th April *23 on the subject of the northern frontier of Kuwait, which shows that it is immediately to the south of SafwSn at this point. X SO not vary hop.ful of Saiyia Ramld cosing in to anyagreement with ’Aodul Latlf, at any rate their respective applications for concessions to the Government of ’Iraq ia known. He of course says that it is his dearest - wish, but I think he has really got hia toes spread out pretty firmly. The last time I saw him, which was three or four days ago, he said that,as the result of telegraphic enquiries he had made, he had learnt that his application had not yet been forwarded to Baghdad, He said he could not understand this, and hinted that some enemy of his in the Mutas&amp;rrlf's Office in Basrah must be having it kept back to give •Abdul Latff's a chance of going through! until tfie result of20th May 1925. To The Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, B A G H D A D # Basrah - icawait ko tor *^rvlQe f Hefersnae your memorandum No. a,8/i4 dated t&gt;th May 1925 It is true that H.S. the Sliiiiid* of Kuwait has granted a Motor Transport Conoeaaioa to Saiyid Haedd Bey an-Haqlb for that portion of the Jahrah - 2ubalr read which lies within his territory! i.e. from Jahrah to Safwan exclusive. I have myself been over the road in question, both by camel and * recently with Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqib - by oar, and am satisfied that there are no engineering difficulties in the way. As a Skitter of fact 1 am sure that a good rode could be made at a much lower figure than that mentioned by the newspaper. I think there is every chance of a Motor Service being established in six or eight months time, but not, I think, until after the summer at any rate. Ho company has yet been formed, and running rights in ’Iraq territory have not yet been obtained. I consider that, if or when this Motor Service is estab» lished, it might well take the place of the Basrah - Pao * Kuwait (waterboai) mail, and, if efficiently run, it might even be used with advantage for the conveyance of mails to and from Bosreh in connection with the Fast Mail steamers to India.

'this raid was one of a number of petty raids on hajd tribes carried out by refugee tribesmen. The Iraq Government took stringent action and removed the refugees from the vicinity of the frontier. The restoration of looted animals was to be arranged later by tribal fasl. Khulaif al Lodhai, however, was then outside Iraq territory; he remained encamped near Jahrah and ignored the orders of tne Iraq Government that he should move nortnwards. so far as is Mnovm &amp;e is still in x^uwait territory and beyona the control of uaghdad.

To British Consul, Jiddah No. 21 . Dated 2 Drd January 1926 Repetition asked for Begins x x * Fnds.mmmm future, and th« question of seourlty froa raids in Kuwait tftm?ltory referred to below. It la a question which should not be dealt with by me direct. 4 # I hope that eventually It may be oo^eible to do as the Shaikh suggests, and utilise this motor &amp;«r/ice for the con veyance of all mails to and from Kuwait - with the exception of those to and from other Gulf ports. This would reduoo the transit from Bombay from an average minimum of fourteen days to an average of seven days, and, as the Fast Mall from /$ Bombay to Baar&amp;h^&amp;lways up to time ?nd the Slow Mail is often late, the service would b# much more regular.I would not, how ever, think of recommending that this be done at present, as before doing so one wants to know that the Kuwait - 'Iraq Motor Transport Oompany is efficiently managed, and that it ^ Is a paying concern and not likely to stop running after a few months. Besides, the conveyance of malls in connection with the Fast Mail steamers at Basrah presupposes an exacting contract which would ensure the cars running punctually even If no passengers wished to travel on a particular day^ and it would be difficult for the Company to estimate how much they could undertake this for before the passenger ser vice has been running for some months, 5. On the other hand I do think that this rotor service night with advantage eupersede the F&amp;o - Kuwait water boat mail as soon as it starts running. The latter, depending as i does on the wind, is naturally irregular and no time clause is possible, so none need be insisted on in a motor service to replace it. As there is no contract of any sort in the Fao - Kuwait 'utor Beat service, jt could be resumed again at any time without difficulty if the motor service did not prove satisfactory. The present intention is for Kuwait - 'Iraq Motor Transport Company’s cars to run between Kuwait and £ubair only, so the ’Iraq Postal Department would have to convey tneae mails from Basrah to ^ubair. This, however,would proo&amp;oly b© simpler than to convey them from 13«srah to Fao, a. has to be done in the case of the Fao - Kuwait water boat mat 6. As you a H]*&gt;• Aa you are aware, the exieting «*ao - Kuwait Water Boat !ail is only a fortnightly service in one direction, that is to say it brings nails from Bas^h every alternate week, when the Inward Slow Kail steamer does not oall at Kuwait. In addition to merely abolishing this, and having the saae mail brought by oar every fortnight Instead, I think that # now that there are facilities, something more might be done to improve the postal service between Kuwait and •irap in both directions. I suggest therefore that an attempt be made to arrange a oontraot with the Kuwait - ’Iraq ? f otor Transport Company for the oonveyanoe of mails - other than Registered and Parcel mails - between Kuwait and Zubair as facilities fer. As thin would not force the Company to run oars at a l&gt;ss on days on which there were no passengers, and as the number of bags and the weight of mail would normelly be very smal?*., I think such a oontraot could be arranged at a moderate coat - and against that would be the saving of Ra.i: i # to.ci. per month which la the average oost of the Fao - Kuwait Hater Ro«t hail* I would suggest, however, that any such oontraot should be for a short period, such as si* months, in the first instance. This would be a gre*t advantage to the Town general! not only to those people who have business dealings with *x Iraq, but also to the larger number who trade with India, as even under existing conditions, it is more expeditious to send letters by the ’’Outward' Slow Mail to connect with the Past Kail at Basrah than lo send thee by the *** 'Inward” Slow Hall direct even when it calls here, but this is not always possibls if the 'Outward” Slow Mail is late, To «e, as Political Agent, it would be of immense value, *e I rould get Basrah newspapers with reasonable frequency, and won: X not be so handicapped as I am at present by the lack of information of what is happenir* in the outside world. ?. I now oome to th* auction of county, and the danger of 0ftr8 bain “ neW U P «•»**•« »nd highway robber., of whloh of course there 1. a „.ry real ri.Ji. It la Urgely for thl. reaaor that I rssoanend that r.gl.tered letter, and paroel. should not be sent by thlbe seat by this route, at any rate at first. On the safety or otherwise of this route depends not only the question oi \ whether the conveyance of mails can safe!/ be entrusted to the Kuwait - ’Iraq Motor Transport Company, but also the question of whether the Company is lively to be a success at all. Given reasonable security, I think there is no doubt it will pay; there are certainly Indications that it is to be run on sound lines; and l think it will probably become the normal routa to Basrah. On the other hand, one or two rOcsrattable incidents at the start of oars being held up by raiders, and perhaps paesangers killed, would probably sound Its death knell. I need hardly say that the success of this Company is of very real importance to the people of Kuwait, not only because of possible improvements to the postal facil. ities, but because it will vastly improve the coErarnioationa of the town generally. &lt;5* The hinterland is undoubtedly quieter at present than it has been for many years, but Bedouin r*ids have taken place since time was, and will doubtless continue to do so for many a year yet. The general opinion of the Shaikh and other com petent Judges, however, is that,if Ibn HsuaisA oa'ud can be persuaded to definitely ferula all interference with care on this route by his followers, this danger will jfc cease to exist for &gt;11 practical purposes, it would not be a big thing for hia to do, as in any oase cars would not have the same attraction to real raiders that c&amp;iaels or sheep do, and, if definitely forbidden, the robber type would fear his retri bution. The Shaikh esyp In his letter that he has written to Ibn Sa’ud on the subject - meaning, of course, that he has asked hira to issue such an order, but both he and everyone else is doubtful whether he will take the trouble to do so merely to please Shaikh Ahmad, but think that he would readiV ©nough if we asked him. Although he naturally could not ask a.* to do so in writing, the Shaikh has made it perfectly oleaj to me verbally that both he and his paoole -ire very anxious that wo snouldtxskfu*- thKt wo should write to tho Sultan, and -ta^ a to forhiU hia ' subjeots 'go Interfere with those notor cr ' ra ae '• eoncUno the malls 2*sx of our British Post Office by thorn* X think it la undoubtedly In the hops that we will t&amp;Jce act lot in this w y nothat both the Shaikh’s letter &amp;nd the petition whj.oh prompted it tfere written now, instead of a month or two later *fter the cars have actually started running, whioh would otherwise have been the more natural time. In view of the importance of the whole ncheiie to Kuwait, I trust that you will consider the desirability of mu«fOM writing to Ibn Sa*ud on the subject. Political Agent,Kuwait.(24?)

Reference your memorandum No.S.6/14 dated 13 th May 1925 It is true that H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait has granted a Motor Transport Concession to Saiyid Hamid Bey &amp;n-Naqlb for that portion of the Jahrah - Zubair road ahloh lies within his territory: i.e. from Jahrah to Safwan exclusive. I have myself been over the road in question, both by/ \ * n question, both by ' o&amp;ael and • recently with S&amp;lyiA Hamid Bey an-Haqib - by oar, i and am satisfied that there are no engineering difficulties in the way. As a matter of fact I am sure that a good road oould be made at a much lower figure than that mentioned by the newspaper. I think there is every chance of a Motor Service being established in six or eight months time, but not, I think, until after the summer at any rate. No company has yet been formed, and running rights in •Iraq territory have not yet been obtained. I consider that, if or when this Motor Service is estab lished, it might well take the place of the Basrah - Fao - Kuwait (waterboat) mail, and, if efficiently run, it might even be used with advantage for the conveyance of mails to and from Basrah in connection with the Fast Mall steamers to India.

The incident was a very disgraceful one, as the seven ’Anizah had Just left Kuwait, where they had been enjoying the hospitality of Shaikh Ahmad for some time. The men had formed the vanguard of Karab bin Hadhdhal’s party which raided the Dhaflr at Rumailah on the 17 th dune and had been out off from the main body of the 'Anizah, They came into Kuwait and claimed Ibn SubSVs protection on the strength of his , Anizah blood. The Shaikh received them in his madhlf and g( ve them the usual presents. # Ali Abu ShuwairibSt and the other Mutairi had not been in Kuwait, but apparently joined the seven near Jahrah.

Another rumour is that the tribes at Hafar have heard aero planes, and, although they have not actually seen any, *they are so frightened that they only approach the place at Aight. The Shaikh of Kuwait thinks, and I think he is right, that •the concentration ordered for the 15th November at Safah was for the purpose of attacking Busaiyah, which was believed to be much stronger than was| the case. Thel party which actually did so was only sent to reconnoitre, but finding it so weak, attacked it. Their success rendered the concentration un necessary and it was cancelled.

The Shaikh sent out some people in a fleet of Fords as soon as he could get them together,but they were too late.- otherwise I think they might h ve had a fair chance of getting the camels back.

They argue that the whole desert is theirs right up to the towns and villages iof ^raq, and that he had no right to agree to any other frontier* Ibn Sa’ud has summoned Dawish to Riyadh three times since he arrived there, and on each occasion he has refused to go, Ibn Sa’ud has now summoned the ’Ulama of the Ikhwsn, and they are on their way to Riyadh, He thinks there is little fear of further raiding Just at present, as the Ikhwan will probably wait to see the result of the conference between Ibn Sa’ud and the ’Ulama, and he has little doubt that Ibn Sa’ud will succeed in talking the latter round and making them see reason.

(622 to 0.0.) mount shaikh of the Mutair crossed the 'Iraq frontier In some force near Jaukhah about 22nd December and raided some Nijd Shammar temporarily in 'Iraq and 'Iraq shepherd tribes with heavy slaughter. He then moved to the north-west to attack the Dahamishah, a sept of the 'Anizah, who fled before him.A state of extreme panic prevails .amongst all 'Iraq desert tribes and there are rumours of other parts of Dawlsh's tribe in the south contemplating raiding. Meanwhile there is a rumour, as yet unconfirmed, that Ibn Sa'ud's forces have captured Arta- wiyah and that orders have been sent to the Governor of Hall to follow up Dawish. The following are the recent events;- On the 5th Hovember the Mutair destroyed Busaiyah post,killing workmen and police. At the end of November they raided near Jahrah in Kuwait territory. On the 9 th December tkmy in the Neutral Zone they attacked the 'Iraq shepherd tribes, and later fired on our aeroplanes, damaging all machines and wounding one man. 'Iraq casualties were 59 men and 7500 animals. Lastly this raid happened on the 22 nd December. British officers in the areas affected say they are placed in a most humiliating position. Shaikhs of 'Iraq desert tribes say quite openly that they must become Ikhwan as the British and 'Iraq Governments cannot protect them. They are already paying zlkat to Dawish's tax collector, some have put on the 'imaah and openly denounce the British. Sooner or later the 'Anizah who stretch right across the desert route are bound to become Ikhwan. If things go on like this I shall soon be forced to advise that the projected desert railway and pipe line follow the northern route through Syria, as the chief advantage of the southern route, to wit greater security, is going. Meanwhile King Faisal and political circles in Baghdad are much excited, and we will soon be accused again of conniving at these Ikhwan attacks to remind 'Iraq that it isdependent on us. The excellent effect of the London negocia- tions with King Faisal, whose attitude since his return has been adairable, may thus be undone. Meanwhile in reply to protests Ibn Sa^d has stated that the Mutair acted against ] his orders and that he means to punish them, but that the British and 'Iraq Governments are responsible for the Mutair hostility as they have fortified desert posts and patrolled the desert with armoured cars and aeroplanes, an argument which is obviously absurd. Our policy should in my opinion depend on whether within the next few weeks Ibn Sa‘ud shows himself determined and able to suppress these attacks by his tribes. If he fails in either respect I see no remedy but to blockade Hasa ports and compel trucial chiefs on the Arab coast to do the same, on the grounds that we see no hope of preventing Ikhwan tribes from attacking except by threaten ing them with starvation and forcing them to resist Ibn Baud King Faisal argues with some reason that the Mutair must think Ibn Sa T ud either approves of their action or is unable to punish them severely, otherwise they would never have bmm been such idiots as to leave their headquarters, property and families unprotected behind them* I suggest that an urgent message be now sent to Ibn Sa’ud recapitulating the series of raids on ^raq and Kuwait, refuting his absurd arguments about fortifying desert posts and telling him that HoM* Government expect him to satisfy them within six weeks that he means to, and can, punish the Mutair and extract compensation from them, otherwise they will be compelled to resort to the blockade of Hasa ports and the stoppage of supplies through other ports, and any other measures which “oay appear possible to force his tribes to behave themselves. Aeroplanes have very great difficulty In dealing with the situation because of the vast distances from air bases at which the raiders operate, and the delay In receiving news of raids. Kindly let ae have a very early reply as ’Iraq tribes are In grave danger, and It Is believed here that the ... force the ’Iraq Government Into ill advised action if we do not do something soon.

With tne Awazim is known to be Ibn Sa , ud*s force, which has been reinforced by Ibn Jiluwi, and numbers 300 men.

Beging:- The request of the Shaikh of Kuwait should be acceded to in so far as it is practicable, but no bombing operations should be carried out, over Kuwait territory, and the function of air craft sent to Kuwait should be limited to reconnaissance • Ends, Telegram (P). From Political,Kuwait, To Resident, Bushire; reapested to Baghdad, No. 267. Dated 31st December 1927, Reference telegram No. 726 from Baghdad. Air reconnaissar, is all that was asked for by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and almost certainly all that will be required. At the same time there is a remote possibity of the Ikhwan attacking the town of Kuwait, and in that case air action against them might be necessary to protect the lives and proper of British subjects,if for no other reason. I venture t suggest that this should be remembered and the Seereta/ State for the Colonies requested beforehand to modify/ XKxjtxkixjKkj&amp;Ma restriction about bombing in that event* There is very little llklihood of this need arising, if it does it will do so suddenly and there will b' to refer the matter then.Telegram (P) From To No* Dated &lt;2 l ' ) / Jr # Political, Kuwait* . Resiuent, Bushire; repeatea to Baghdad* 266 » 31st December 1927* The opinion in Kuwait regarding the present state of affairs in the eesert is as jd follows:- Dawish is acting contrary te the wishes of Ibn Sa’ud, who is Just as anxious for peace on the border at the present time as we are ourselves* He is, however, in a very difficult position, as he is hated in the Hijaz, and has enemies in Najd even amongst his own family (it is almost certain that his brother and nephew were at the bottom of the plot to murder his son and * Abdullah bin Jilawi last summer), and the Ikhwan tribes are the people whom he ha to rely on most to keep him on his throne* Although he is extremely annoyed with them, therefore, he will not dare t# try and punish the Mutair - particularly in view of the fact that in 1926 Faisal ad-Dawlsh, Ibn riumaid and Dhaldan al- Hithlain bound themselves by oath mutually to support each other in such a cas • On the other hand he will probably restore his authority by persuasion and peaceful means, and will then be in a position to keep the tribes quiet - at any rate for some time* This is what people hope will happen as anything would be preferable to the appalling chaos which a revolution in Najd would entail, even if it did remove trie ban on trade between Najd and Kuwait* Meanwhile t e recent events and Dawish^ success In raiding up to now are having an extremely bad effect on our prestige inArabia (the Government of 'Iraq has none and is looked upon as a negligible quantity altogether)* People argue th -t our aircraft cannot harm the raiders or protect t. e frontier* They do not understand our respect for treaties ana frontiers: the reason why we do not retaliate and chastise the Mutair by bombing them or their villages is that we cannot or dare not do so. Ibn Sa'ud might possibly lodge a protest, but in reality he would be very pleased, were we to taKe suchaction and &amp;o ri^ht Into Najd and punish them. Unless our aeroplanes have the ^ood luck to get an opportunity of teaching them a severe lesson in the near future, not will all desert tribes most certainly become Ikhwan, but Ikhwanism will probably spread to the Jazirah, This is what Intelligent jqkx 2 B*sx*l people in Kuwait think.Telegram (en clair) Police, Busal^ah, report the arrival there of a Dhafirl from Gumalz al-Asllb (Araif Dhafir Najd) who states Ihn Sa’ud and Ibn Humald at Khufalzl$ah and proceeded for attack on Dawlsh e Telegram (en clair)* From Special, Naslriyah* To Political, Kuwait.

As such, the file contains two reports regarding these raids that were submitted to the Political Agency in Kuwait by the Senior Staff Officer of the Akhwan Defence, a British force that had been established to counter the threat of Ikhwan raids into Iraq and monitor their movements (folios 40-47 and 84-130).The file also contains correspondence that relates to discussions concerning the construction of a paved road (for the use of motor vehicles) between Southern Iraq and Kuwait. A copy of a concession for its construction that was granted to Sayyid Hamid bin Rajab al-Naqib by the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, is contained in Arabic (folios 67-69) and English (folios 72-75). In this context, the file contains descriptions written by the Political Agent in Kuwait, Major James Carmichael More, of a number of different routes between Southern Iraq and Kuwait at the time. These descriptions are as follows:Jafrah to Safwan (in English, folios 49-53 and Arabic, folios 59-62);Kuwait to Basrah via Basrah and then direct to Safwan (folios 54-57);Jahrah to Zubair (folios 137-146).Towards the end of the file, the correspondence in the file discusses reports of the tensions between the Ikhwan and Ibn Sa'ud and the beginning of the Ikhwan revolt.As well as correspondence between British officials, correspondence between Political Agent More and the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah (in Arabic with English translations) appears throughout the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Ikhwan revolt (1927-1930)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003c1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
