''' EASTERN (Arabia ), f' , I January 8, 1929. CONFIDENTIAL ^ \ . S ect.on 1. [E 140/3/91] No. 1. Mr. Jakins to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received January 8, 1929.) (No. 215.) Sir, Jeddah, December 20, 1928. WITH reference to my telegram No. 105, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of the original letter addressed to me by Ibn Saud on the decision made by His Majesty's Government as a result of the report rendered by Sir Gilbert Clayton on his negotiations. 2. His Majesty acknowledges the assurances given by His Majesty's Govern ment and the Iraq Government that the customary migrations of the Nejd tribes in Iraq will not be impeded; he, however, seeks to defend his interpretation of the third clause of the Protocol of Uqair by reviving his claim to the southern territories of Iraq, which, he asserts, he only ceded for fear of a complete rupture with His Majesty's Government and in response to a definite promise given by the representa tive of His Majesty's Government that no fortifications—such as he maintains the present posts to be—would be erected on the frontier. 3. In His Majesty's Government's acceptance of article 6 of the Treaty of Bahra as applying to British forces provided that the position on the frontier never menaces the security of Iraq, Ibn Saud sees an attempt to place a reservation to the existing agreement. He therefore begs His Majesty's Government to accept the text as it stands. 4. He also asks His Majesty's Government to reconsider their decision with regard to the interpretation of article 3 of the Uqair Protocol, and finally states that if his arguments do not prevail he is prepared to resort to arbitration. He accordingly requests that His Majesty's Government should give consideration to his views that— (1.) The arbitrators should be chosen by Iraq and Nejd. (2.) His Majesty's Government should remain neutral. (3.) That the arbitrators should be impartial and have adequate knowledge of the local conditions. (4.) That they should examine the origin of the position and study the incidents which have arisen subsequently. (5.) That His Majesty's Government should undertake to enforce in Iraq any decision reached. (6.) That after the arbitration consideration should be given to avoid any consequent harm. (7.) That the matter should be treated with the utmost expedition. „ 5 -. 1 have sent a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. H. G. JAKINS. Enclosure in No. 1. Ibn Saud to Mr. Jakins. (Translation.) WE have received your letter dated the 16th November, 1928, which his Excellency the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of His Britannic Majesty's Government, directed you to convey to us. So we beg your Excellency to send to His Britannic Majesty's Government our following reply to that letter ; 1. We have taken note of what was brought to the knowledge of the British Government as a result of the negotiations that took place between us and their representative, Sir Gilbert Clayton, and that they do not ag^e to our interpretation of the third clause of the First Protocol of Uqair. [679 h-l] t2. Our regret is very great, as this reply from the British Government not only destroys all our hopes for a settlement of the matter, but is an arrow directed towards our confidence in the conversations we had with the British representative at I qair and has affected our confidence in all the covenants and engagements we have concluded, and shall conclude, with Britain. This result made the worst impression in the whole of Nejd. 3. We have gathered the people of Nejd and presented to them, from all aspects, the result of the situation arrived at, but the explanation increased their insistence that they were right and their determination to resist the injustice to their country. 4. The only plea put forward by the British Government on their own behalx and on behalf of Iraq with regard to our objection to the building on the borders of the frontiers is that our request for the prohibition of building restricts the principle of the liberty of the right of every Government to take administrative measures within its territory. The British Government will realise, as they acknowledged in their letter, that such right was limited by written agreements. 5. The lands against the building on which we protested do not belong to Iraq but are the property of Nejd and the tribes of Nejd formerly and latterly^ It was the Amirs of Nejd who governed those deserts, as all who know Iraq and Nejd from the earliest times until to-day bear witness. 6. We maintained our right to those lands at the time of the meeting ot Lqair and insisted on this because they belong to us, our people and our subjects, and we refused the Treaty of Mohammerah for this reason. But the British repi'e!-entciti'vc insisted most strongly and compelled us to yield them to Iraq, and we were obliged to accept so that the dispute might not be the cause of the outbreak of war between us and the British Government. 7. The British representative offered us, as a price for that concession, a promise that no fortification or stronghold menacing to Nejd or its people would be built in the lands taken from us. This is in the statement which includes the borders of the frontiers and does not limit them by mile or metre. The verbal declarations of the British representative convinced us that Britain would preserve that. Unfortunately, we have had no result from those declarations. ... 8. The British Government will thus see that our object and claim in these lands at that time was for the following reasons :— {a.) To conserve the right of Nejd to its territories as they formerly were and as they have continued from the earliest time. • t (&amp;.) That these territories are dwelling places for the people of Nejd and pasture lands for them. . c (c.) That these places are the door of Nejd, and Nejd can only be assured oi her independence and life if these territories are under her constraint and suzerainty, as she was unable in former times to protect herself m her countrv except when the deserts of those regions were under her constraint and suzerainty. The claim of Neid for those territories was the claim of one to preserve his life and soul. When we were thus compelled at Uqair, we asked for the preservation ot the rights of our subjects and for the preservation of the rights of Nejd and hei independence and an assurance to preclude what might be taken at some hour as a base for aggression against her. When we were granted our request in this respect the great calamity in abandoning that part of the territories which is, in fact, true castle of defence to Nejd was slightlv lessened. e 9. In addition to the above. Sir Gilbert Clayton enquired of us the reason of our insistence on our principle set out m the third clause of the Protocol of T qair. We answered him that what we saw of the Iraq Government and their movements did not reassure us about the future but increased our fears, for we see her aggression against us daily increasing. Our lands were taken at Uqair and yesterday our agreement was broken in the erection of buildings which she called guard posts and. to reassure us, affirmed that thev are only police stations. But she did not wait fiom eve till morn before changing those guard posts into strong fortifications containing all the requirements of militarv citadels and fortresses She is able every dav to invent a reason and make stations in lands which are without doubt Neidi. to expose Neid to all sorts of harm, such as the aeroplanes and cars drawn from those stations which uniustifiablv penetrated our territories even m the days of the negotiations. There are the interferences of Iraq officials with our subjects which continue untilto-day, against which we have protested and to which the newspaper 1 A1 Iraq, published in Bagdad on the 19th Tashrin Awal, 1347, referred. We are therefore not secure from Iraq. 10. If there were no third clause of the Protocol of Uqair between Nejd and Iraq, Nejd would see in those buildings a menace to her existence and independence built with evil intention against her, and she cannot be reassured about her life while they exist. She protests against their erection and opposes it. In doing so she sees herself defending her right and her life threatened some day by sudden danger. 11. We therefore beg the British Government for the preservation of the interests of right, justice and equity to reconsider their decision in this matter and look considerately on what we have mentioned in this letter in order to preserve tranquillity and calm in a country where it is not at all to the interest of the British Government to see incalculable bloodshed. 12. When we concluded the Protocol of Uqair it never entered our mind that there would be any room for explanation or interpretation, and that what was given us as compensation for the loss of our territories would be taken from us through interpretation. We had no doubt or suspicion as to the correctness of our arguments and proofs, and we had no idea that we should be invited to go to an arbitrator for judgment in a thing which is as clear as daylight. We believe that the foregoing explanation will convince the British Government to reconsider their decision. If, however, all that has already been mentioned does not result in explaining the truth and matters have reached such an extreme of confusion that the British Government will not be satisfied to execute the third clause of the Protocol of Uqair as it stands unless it is referred to arbitration, we, in spite of the interior difficulties which we face in the present situation, will accede to the request of the British Government and accept arbitration if the British Government will take into consideration the state and position of the Nejd people on the frontiers in this matter and will observe the following points with regard to the arbitration :— (1.) The arbitrators shall be constituted of two parties, of which we shall choose part and the Iraq Government the other part. (2.) The British Government will be neutral in this arbitration. (3.) The arbitrators shall be people familiar with the conditions of the Arabs, zealous in the interests of the Arab question, solicitous of the preservation of the independence of Nejd and of Iraq now and in the future. (4.) That the subject of discussion by the arbitrators should be to study the position from its origin and to return to the examination of the frontiers between Iraq and Nejd. To learn what formerly went on and the occurrence of incidents in the past for which there is no lawful justification. (5.) The British Government will be responsible for the execution in Iraq of the decision, whether to Iraq or to Nejd, that the arbitrators will make. (6.) After the decision of the arbitrators it is necessary that consideration should be given to avoid harm falling on any party in the execution of the arbitration. (7.) The question of the arbitration should be decided and settled as soon as possible, because the position is critical and delicate and brooks no delay. 13. If the above-mentioned basis is considered, we await the views of the v British Government in this respect. 14. We have taken note of what is mentioned in the sixth paragraph of the letter of the British Government regarding the inclusion of British forces within the scope of the article 6 of the Treaty of Bahra and article 10 of the Treaty of Hadda, but the condition mentioned in that paragraph is contradictory to the article itself, for the text of article 6 of the Treaty of Bahra is as follows :— ' The forces of Iraq and Nejd may not cross the common frontier in the pursuit of offenders except with the consent of both Governments.' This text contains no condition or stipulation^ Do the British Government wish to make here room for disagreement so as to justify the action of the aviators who crossed our territories and then desire to refer the interpretation to a committee of arbitration too? This condition is new to the discussion. So we beg the British Government to reconsider this view in correcting it and to leave the article in its reality, because the door of interpretation will leave no value in the treaties.4 15. We received with regard the assurances of the British and Iraq Govern ments officially when Sir Gilbert Clayton declared to us that nothing would be done on their part to oppose the rights which the Nejd tribes enjoyed, either in roaming, grazing or taking water from the wells and the waters situated within the Iraq frontiers in accordance with the old accepted customs. 16. In any case, we thank the British Government for the desire they have expressed to arrive at a solution to remove the standing dispute, and we hope to receive their early reply to our letter as the position is still critical and requires most speedy settlement. This is what we beg to be conveyed to the British Government. Respects, (Sealed) IBN SAUD.

Mr. Jakins to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received January 22, 1929 ) (No. 231.) Sir, Jeddah, December 31, 1928. IN continuation of my despatch No. 214 of the 20th December I have the honour to transmit herewith a further translation of the report* of the meeting of Ibn Saud with the Nejd tribes at Riyadh. This extract comprises the complaints of the tribal spokesmen and the replies of the ulema and of the King. 2. The tribes are reported as acknowledging that their enlightenment came from Ibn Saud and from God. They begged His Majesty that he would ensure that all his subjects received the spiritual guidance he had provided for themselves. They asked whether the telegraph w r as not witchcraft and then, closely following a familiar argument, questioned the wisdom of allowing the frontier to be fixed in their country. Finally, with an apt reference to the Uqair Protocol, they said that they would leave the frontier posts standing and refrain from a jehad on a ruling from the ulema, that they would thereby be open to no reproach from the Almighty and on an assurance from the King that there was no menace there to their spiritual or material security. 3. The ulema then gave a ruling that telegraphs were not unlawful,'and His Majesty declared that he was arranging for all of his subjects to be provided with religious teachers. Ibn Saud then seems to have told the tribes that they were responsible for the attack and massacre at Busaiya. This they admitted, adding [that they would have proceeded against Feisal-ed-Doweish if they could have been sure that he would not have been sheltered in Iraq and that the posts would be demolished. The ulema supported this plea for the removal of the posts, but the King declined to discuss the matter in open meeting and said he would choose fifty from among them to whom he would explain everything. He then brought the meeting to an end with a finely confused reference to peace and war, upon which the assembly burst into tears, and having paid homage, retired for refreshment. 4. As I have already had the honour to report, no details of the proceedings at the private meeting have been published. 5. I have sent a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty's High Commissioners for Iraq and Transjordan. I have, &amp;c. H. G. JAKINS. * Not printed.

As recent ruirours indicate the pospiMlity of an early recrudescence of raiding on the part of the Mutair, the GoTernment of 'Iraq reouept that Ibn Sa'ud should be asked by His Majesty 1 s GoYernment to despatch an adequate force under a responsible leader to A1 Hafar t or some other place near hie frontier so as to preyent JSajd tribes froio raiding, authorising the leader to com* *i ; * T municate direct with Capt.

TiB December 7th reporte mainly through the Political A^ent Kuwait indicated that the Riyadh con ference had 'broVen up without reading a decision as regards the policy towards 'Iraq. Ihn Sa'ud had, how- ever, forbidden raiding for two months pendinr further discussion with British representative, A1 Dawish, and possibly other important Alchwan shaiVhs had, howerei; not obojied the 8umr&lt;onp to Riyadh and it seemed doubtful whether they would afrree to two months truce. 7* S. On Deoember talatrrom No. 1234 from tha I'olitioal A Heaident at Bushire was received stating that Ibn Sa'ud was detained in Jsajd, This neant abandonment of the iiwetinp with the Political Affent, Bahrain, previously arranged and supfrested that Ibn Sa'ud was having diffi culty in enforcing his orders. 3, Simultaneously rumours bepran to circulate in the desert that the Mutair contemplated a resumption of raids against 'Iraq and the Dhafir sections who had crossed into 'Iraq hurried back to Najd on receipt of a warning. 4, During the second weeV of December four small raiding or reconnoitring parties of the Lutair were reported in the neutral zone and Mm neighbourhood. 5, On December 16th Royal Air Force Intelligence in the desert reported that Dawish had circularised Akhwan shaikhs j]K^&lt;c:^aaevpwut.. *i / ■' • r n if! il f v \ V 11 74.) s. . 8 - shaikhB inTltinpr them to join a raid on ^raq and that Ihn Humaid (Ataibah) had written to Ibn &amp;a*ud that he intended to join. (At thie etage I despatched telepraa Ho. 624 dated December 21et, inciting co-operation of Ibn Sa^d, Agent Jiddah did not take action for fear of hurting Ibn Sa'ud's feelinge)• On the same date Kuwait telegraphed a report that Dawish had informed Ibn Sa'ud that he proposed to raid the Dahamehah in * Iraq immediately. The -Uahamshah also received warning jfetaak on the same date that kuhein al ?irm (Harb) wae concentrating hie tribesmen for a lar^e raid on •Iraq. Simultaneously Jasr.a ibn Ujlad, a Daham- shah shaikh, stated he had received a letter from Ibn Pa'ud ordering him to return to Kajd to which he had not replied. It wae then commonly reported that Ibn Sa'ud had sanctioned raid on ^raq Analza and that Dawish, Ibn Htimaid and Al Firm had informed Ibn Sa^d th at they intended to raid the Anaizah. 6. On December 30th the Political Agent at Kuwait telegraphed a report, subsequently confirmed, receired by the Shaikh of Kuwait that Ajman tribesmen were concentra ting at Jaryah (south of Kuwait) for a large rteid probably on 9 Iraq and that Dawish was joining them with a ^utair force. 7. On December 2®th an attempted raid by Mutair near Jumaimah was repulsed by aircraft (see my telegram No. 632 dated December 30th). P. On January 1st a raiding arty of 3C utair camel- men and 6 horsemen attacked •Iraq Zniyad tribesmen in neutral sone. ihe latter beat off the raiders and put them to flight. Fiye iutair prisoners were taken. 9. On January 2nd s shepherd tribesman reported that he T had seen 1,000 camelmen 30 miles of Vumaimah in 9 Iraq territory.fifty s' • 3 • territory. An aericl reoonnalesance is now inreBtigating* 10* On 3rd January an Anaisa ecout arrired from Oaituma, forty fire milos within ^ajd territory »outh«w«Bt of Jumaimah, interviewed Captain Glutb, reported raiders from Harb and Shammar collecting at that place from all directions to attack Anaisa. Gcout met meseenfrer from Ibn Sa'ud with letters to Dahamshah shaikhs warning them to return to Hajd or flee to the Suphrates, Olubb telegraphs only way to aToid disaster to Anaisa is for aircraft to reconnoitre Oaisuma # but I have informed him this is out of question. 11. All eTidence pAint to possibility of raiding on large scale in near future in which lutair # t&gt;hajnmar, Harb, Ataibah and Ajman tribes may participate. Immediate threat is against ♦Iraq Anaisa in Wadian area 9 but concentration at Jaryah also threatens ^raq tribes in southern desert. King and Cabinet are in panic and anticipate terrific catastrophe. If invasion on anticipated scale takes place I see no other plan than either to repeat last yea^s measures of operations within Hajd or marine blockade. I beg that His Britannic iiajesty^ GoTernment will take future policy into immediate consideration. In any event I trust that immediate request be made to Ibn Sa^ud to co*operate with British and 'Iraq authorities by restraining intending raiders* Reference is to my telegrams Nos. 3 and 9 of the 2nd and 3rd January respectively.

As the incidents, which caused the dispute, had occurred in * Iraq territory and as both the disputants ware 9 Iraq subjects, the Hut^sarrif was unable to adopt Ibn kuaa , ad , e proposal.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 17 of to-day's date, 1 have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a letter received from King Ibn ^aud in answer to Mr. Jakins's communication of the 29th December (Jeddah despatch No. 230), and a copy of the reply I have addressed to His Majesty. 2. On the receipt of this letter I immediately telephoned to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs asking him whether, as the result of this communication, he now understood the King s proposals for the appointment of arbitrators. Fuad Hamza admitted that the position had not been made an^ clearer. I therefore informed Fuad that I was addressing a further communication to the King on the lines of my recent conversation with him (as reported in my despatch No. 39 ol the 2nd instant), and would be grateful if he would himself, when forwarding this letter, explain clearly the various points and impress their importance on His Majesty. This Fuad promised to do. 3. In his communication under reference Ibn Sand explains his conditions 1 and 2 to mean that if Iraq is to appoint one arbitrator His Majesty's Government should not also appoint one, as the Nejd nominee would then be faced with both an Iraqi and a British nominee. It appears from this explanation that Ibn Saud has not yet fully grasped the meaning of the arbitration proposal. 4. The King makes no mention in his letter of condition 6, of which Mr. Jakins also requested an explanation, and I have therefore again approached him on this point. Fuad Hamza, speaking unofficially, takes the King's meaning to be that if a decision is given in favour of Nejd, Iraq's feelings should as far as possible be spared, e.g., an immediate demolition of the offending posts should not be demanded, but they should be vacated and allowed to disintegrate by natural processes. Similarly, if a decision is given in favour of Iraq, Iraq shall not immediately proceed to build more posts, nor shall Ibn Saud reply by building a chain of posts on his side of the frontier. The underlying feeling in Ibn Saud's mind is, Fuad thinks, that every effort should be made in giving effect to the decision of the arbitrators not to aggravate ill-feeling between the two countries, but as far as possible to soften the blow to the party against whom the decision is given. 5. The King explains the intention of his condition 4 at some length. He states that the object of the arbitration is to arrive at a decision on the points of disagreement which have arisen between the two parties. He maintains that he only consented at Uquair to cede to Iraq territories claimed by Nejd on the express under standing (article 3) that no buildings should be erected on these territories. His Majesty's Government have refused to accept this interpretation of the article; thus, as his acceptance of article 1 was conditional on the acceptance of article 3 as interpreted by him, his cession of the territories to Iraq becomes ineffective—thus the dispute between Iraq and Nejd centres not on article 3 alone, but on articles 1 and 3. 6. Ibn Saud therefore requests that the arbitrators should be approached by both parties with a view to their considering the question of the frontiers in addition to the question of article 3, which, as it arose out of article 1, cannot be considered alone. 7. I have addressed a copy of this despatch, with its enclosures, to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIRD.2 Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Ihn Sand to Mr. S tone he w e r -Bird. (Translation.) (After compliments.) WE have received your Excellency's letter in which you enquired about some of the points suggested by us regarding the arbitration. e are glad to acquaint the British Government of the following explanations :— 1. The object of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the twelfth clause of our letter is that one party only and not two should be appointed to the Commission o! Arbitration opposite our representatives. So that if Iraq is going to select the arbitrators the British Government will be neutral in the Commission ot Arbitration, and will not delegate anyone on their behalf. 2. We explain the object of paragraph 4 of the twelfth clause of our letter referred to as follows : The purpose of the Commission of Arbitration will be to look into the disagreement which has fallen between the two parties with a view to giving a judgment on it. And as on the day of Ijquair we did not consent to give up our territories which have been annexed to Iraq, except under overwhelming circumstances, and that this ceding was subject to the condition that there should be no building on the lands which we had ceded, and as the British Government has refused to accept this as the meaning of the third clause of the Protocol of Uquair (as mentioned in your Excellency's letter of the 16th November, 1928), our yielding those lands conditional on the meaning of the third clause will be without effect. The dispute will consequently be not about the third clause of the Protocol of Uquair alone, but about the first and third clauses. We therefore request that we and Iraq should approach the arbitrators with a view to considering the question of the frontiers and the question of the third clause, which arose out of the first clause. With respects. (Seal of Ibn Saud.) 11.8.1347 (23.1.1929). Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. Stonehewer-Bird to Ihn Sand. (After respectful compliments.) Your Majesty, Jeddah, February 5, 1929. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Majesty's letter of the 23rd January, in which your Majesty was good enough to explain certain proposals with regard to arbitration. 2. I fear that I must trouble your Majesty once again on the subject of conditions 1 and 2 under paragraph 12 of your Majesty's letter of the 12th December. 3. It is, I gather, your Majesty's proposal that arbitrators should be chosen in equal numbers by Nejd and Iraq. I venture to point out that arbitration in these conditions could have no hope of success. Provision must, if Nejd and Iraq are to choose one or more arbitrators each, be made for the selection of a neutral arbitrator, as otherwise a majority vote could not be assured. The usual practice is for the Governments concerned to arrange the appointment by agreement of an additional or neutral arbitrator. The parties to the dispute should, moreover, agree in advance to accept the decision of the majority of the arbitrators. 4. I am authorised to suggest as an alternative course for your Majesty's consideration the appointment of'a single arbitrator of high repute to be selected by agreement between the parties to the dispute. 5. I should be grateful if your Majesty would be good enough to explain the precise meaning of condition 6 in paragraph 12 of letter No. 31/12. T? pcrvpf &lt;5 F. H. W.

Mr. Stonehevjer Bird to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received February 26.) (No. 43. ) Sir, Jeddah, February 7, 1929. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a letter from Ibn Saud on the subject of the recent bombing of Nejd subjects in Iraq and the rumour of a Nejd incursion on a large scale. 2. Ibn Saud writes that he would have preferred that the information contained in Mr. Jakins's notes of the 5th January, of which copies were transmitted under printed despatches Nos. 11 and 12 of the 6th January, had emanated from His Majesty's Government, who verify the information they receive, rather than from Captain Glubb, who, he cannot help feeling, acts on the frontier in a manner contrary to the interests and desires of His Majesty's Government, thus disturbing the good relations of the two countries and increasing the difficulties of the situation. The report of a raid by Ibn Ashwan appears, Ibn Saud continues, to have been untrue. Captain Glubb based his unjustifiable aggression on Nejdi subjects, who were proceeding to pasture their animals in the desert, on unreliable reports from Bedouins. Three men and twelve camels were killed on this occasion. Ibn Saud protests and demands compensation. 3. The King traces the report that he had sanctioned the perpetration of a raid into Iraq on a large scale to Captain Glubb, who, by spreading such rumours on the frontier and reporting them to His Majesty's Government, succeeds by the resultant increased movement of forces on the frontier in inflaming the passions of the Nejdis. Ibn Saud regards Captain Glubb's activities as a most dangerous menace to peace. 4. hen negotiations with Sir Gilbert Clayton were broken off. the situation in Nejd itself and on the frontier was, Ibn Saud states, most critical; he had, indeed, the gravest doubts of his ability to maintain the direction of affairs. Never theless, he did not relax his endeavours to maintain peace throughout the frontier area. He spent considerable sums of money with this object. As the result of his efforts no incidents have occurred in which his subjects have been involved. He assembled in conference the Amirs, ulema and chiefs of Nejd; all were in complete agreement that the erection of the frontier posts was a breach of treaty, and that their maintenance constituted a grave danger not only to the land and people but to the sovereignty of Xejd. Duty dictated that every possible measure should be adopted to effect their removal. Ibn Saud asserts that he did his best to convince the people of the necessity for patience and the continuance of his policy of working for the removal of the offending posts by peaceful methods. Some of his hearers were guided by hrs views; others considered that to continue a policy of patience would merely aggravate the present danger to Nejd. He is endeavouring to induce these latter to be patient and deliberate, though, as His Majesty's Government knows, ^ he himself believes them to be right in their views that the posts are illegal. 5. It is, Ibn Saud states, at this critical juncture of Xejd affairs, when he is using his utmost endeavours to maintain peace and security, that King Faisal pays a visit to the frontier. Captain Glubb executes disturbing movements, and the people of T ransjordan continue to use the Jauf area as a field for plunder. If, therefore, his earnest endeavours in the cause of peace do not succeed in preventing a move ment against Iraq, he will not be to blame. He wishes His Majesty's Government to know of the efforts which he has been making, and to remind them that, as he informed Sir Gilbert Clayton, he cannot accept responsibility for the results of the breakdown of the negotiations nor of Iraq's insistence on maintaining the posts. 6. The King's letter is, in face of the provocation of which he^feels himself to be the victim by King Faisal's untimely excursion to the frontier and the action which resulted on Captain Glubb's apparently unfounded report of an incursion en masse mto Iraq, decidedly moderate in tone. ' He does not so much inveigh against King Faisal and Captain Glubb as seek to convince His Majesty's GoverrTment that a repetition of the incidents complained of will result in his inability to curb, as he [707 cc—3]k 2 has hitherto been able to do, the passions of his subjects, and that the responsibility for what may consequently occur should not be borne by him. The letter is also interesting in that it supplies what is without doubt an authentic version of the proceedings of the Riyadh Conference. The King does not pretend, as did the writer of the ' Um-el-Kura ' version, that the chiefs and ulema were unanimous in accepting the King's views. There still remain, Ibn Saud states, those whom he has not been able to convince that a policy of patience and deliberation is in the best interests of Nejd. 7. I have addressed a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEIIEWER-RTRD. Enclosure in No. 1. Ihn Saud to Mr. Stoneheiver-Bird. (Translation.) WE have received your letters dated 24.7.1347 (5th January, 1929), and we beg you to convey to the British Government our reply to the two letters as follows :— 1. It would have interested us to receive the news your Excellency related concerning Mr. Glubb from the British Government, who, we believe, test the informa tion which reaches them instead of from Mr. Glubb, who, so far as we believe, acts on the frontiers against the wishes and contrary to the interests of the British Government, thus disturbing the clear relations between the two countries and increasing the difficulties of the situation. 2. The raid reported to have been made by Ibn Ashwan is apparently not true, and the aggression of Mr. Glubb on those Arabs of our subjects who were proceeding for pasturage in the desert was an unjustifiable aggression, and was based on the reports of some Bedouins in whose statements no reliance can be placed. As i« mentioned in the letter, the result was that three men were killed and twelve camels destroyed. We protest against this action and claim the necessary compensation. 3. As to the rumour reported to the British Government to the effect that we have allowed some of the tribes to make a raid on a large scale against Iraq, this, we believe, is one of the reports which Mr. Glubb spreads at the frontiers in order to kindle the fire on both sides. For, on the one hand, he excites the people of Nejd by his movements and assemblies, and, on the other, sends disturbing news to the British Government about the Nejd people in order that they f ? His Majesty's Government] may make increased movements and preparations, consequently increasing the excitation of the Nejd people, and thus making the outbreak of bloody events inevitable. This action, as the British Government will realise *is one of the most dangerous and repulsive menaces to peace on the frontiers. 4. It is beyond dispute that when the negotations between us and his Excellency General Clayton were broken off owing to a failure to arrive at any agreement, the position in Nejd and at the frontiers was dangerous to the last degree, and it was to our belief almost impossible that we should succeed maintaining the direction of affairs, but we pursued the matter and exerted our best endeavours to maintain peace throughout the vicinity of the frontier. We spent very considerable sums of money in this way until we prevented the occurrence of any incident. In spite of the critical position our subjects were not concerned in any incident whatever on the frontier after the breakdown of the negotiations. We gathered the Amirs of Nejd, its ulema and chiefs, and the thoughtful people there, and all completely agreed that those inauspicious posts were built in contravention of the agreement, that there could be no content while they remained, and that duty dictated that whatever was possible should be done to remove them. They found that they were one of the greatest dangers threatening not only Nejd and 'its people, but also the Nejd realm. We did our best in conference to convince the people of the necessity for patience and deliberation in the matter and for the continuation of peaceful endeavours to remove those posts. Some of them were guided by our views, others considered that to remain patient concerning them would increase the danger to Nejd. These people are those we are seeking to persuade to be patient and deliberate although we believe, as the British Government know, that they in their insistence are right to consider the building of those inauspicious posts unlawful.3 5. This is the position in Nejd, and at the time when we are exerting our best endeavours to maintain peace and security we see the King of Iraq come to the vicinity of the frontier and work to rouse the tribes and to assemble them, and we see the disturbing movements of Mr. Glubb, the result of which we inform the British Government is highly dangerous. 6. We therefore say that if the endeavours we are making do not result in preventing a movement against Iraq pending settlement of matters in a peaceful manner, the cause of this will be not the people of Nejd, but (1) the King of Iraq by his last journey, (2) Mr. Glubb by his grave movements, and (3) the people of Transjordan who have made the Jauf area a field for plunder all along the line and at all times. 7. We wish the British Government to know that we made these endeavours to keep peace in the time past and we informed General Clavton that we are not responsible for the results consequent on the breaking-up of the negotiations and the fiT insistence of the Iraq Government in breaking their agreement concerning the building the guard posts. This is what we beg you to communicate to the British Government. (Respects.)

According to information sent 'by Bin Saud in his letter to Sheikh of Kuwakt, former was to leave Riyadh on February 25th for qasim with all his forces. Bin Saud did not state the object of his movement 'but his most likoly object seems to^secure control of tribes. It therefore seems most desirable that a strong protest should be made to him at once against these repeated attacks on Mesopotamian tribes. Telegram P. From. Political,Bushire. To.

Sir, L ^ith refereaoe to the oorretpondenoe eadio^ witn / /our tele ^rna Ho. dated the kjth February 19^9 o 11 th# subjeot of the Kuwait - iiUbair Road, I have the honour to iaforai you that Kis Sxoellenoy the Shalith of Kuwait has fciven an undertaking in writing that he will not hold the Mutasarrif of Baarah la any way respoaeible for the lives or property of Kuwait subjects using the road, elpen on that portion of it which lies in 'Iraq territory, if at his request they be allowed to use it before the Mutasarrif is prepared to accept the responsibility of declaring the road open for general use, always provided that the road be closed a ^ain if and when the Shaikh conveys the requ st that this aay be done. At the present Ko^eat, aojever* he doss not wish his subjects to oe allowed to use it. ?• If and whea the Shaikh does fi^aia wish the road to be opened for Kuw&amp;it subjects as above, he will not accept responeibility for the safety of other natlonalitiet using, the Kuwait portion of it, at any rate until the Mutasarrif of Basrah Is a^ain prepared to accept responsl- bilitT for the safety of Kuwait subjects usin&amp; the 'Iraq portion. 3. Tfte Shaikh will not neceosarily accept responai- biiity for the safety of the aail.in Kuwait territory when ever it la allowed to leave, even thou&amp;h he nay requestU) (ulT ) th ^vt Kuwait subjects be allowed to use the road, as he is aonsldering the desirability of detailing a special otTlcial to aocoapany the wall our haoketrdf aad forwards until normal conditions are restored, and I shall Infora you on this point when the tine ooaes# 4. Even when normal conditions are restored, the Shaikh considers it undesirable that the road should a&amp;aln be opened to quite »s unrestricted traffic is in the past. In his opinion it is Impossible, froa the nature of the country through which the road passes, to guarantee the absolute safety of those who use it, and he thlaics it only fair that travellers should realise and accept such ris^ as aust inevitably exlst 9 *nd that they should be protected froa any risk that can be avoided. 3. Two potential dangers would seem to exist on this road, naaely (a) robbers and (b) raiders. (a) When the Kuwait - 'Iraq Motor Transport Cosspany was first foraed, it was the invariable custoa for any car belonging to it to halt a short distance out of Kuwait or Zubair, and for the driver to unlock a box on the running board and hand round rifles and aaaunitlon to the pa8sen c ^n # which he collected and locked away again before arriving at the other end. I gather that, as these have never been required up to date, the custoa has been allowed to lapse, and some of the cars a^ any rate do not carry any at all now. The Shaikh thinks that this custom should be revived and that no entirely unaraed car should be allowed to proceed alone. One or two rifles are obviously a very good protection against robbers, and the very faot of its being known that all cars using the rosd are araed aight in itself deter aany such people from attempting to waylay cars. Ciirs should aoreover only use the road during the hours of daylight. ( d ) Against a party of raiders on the other hand three or four rifles are, in the Shaikh's opinion, of no use whatsoever, and it is obviously iapossibls for hi«, or anyone else, to furnish cars with escorts strong enough tobruih r&amp;ldln^ ptrtlea a.side If they 'net «ith* But a oar ba» the very advantagt of pao« y and provided It aeee ^nd recognizes the ralrlln^ party la tl.4e it h^» little to fear froa it, Raidere are iatereated in caaels and aheep and nothing eiee, and there is no fear of tnelr interferins with a oar unless it run rl^ht into theau The Shaikh thinks there* fore that the best aeans of protecting oars against raiders are (i) to have the nost efficient machinery possible for olosln^ the road rapidly on receipt of inforoatlon that raiders are In the vicinity, and (11) to ensure that no oar travels alone which has not some person In it with a suf ficient knowledge of the Desert to recognise a raiding party if he sees one, and to appreciate at their true value such warnings or information aj he aay receive from shepherds or othor travellers on the road. As regards ii), the Shalirii is issuing orders to his anj*r In Jahrah to stop oars there in the event of his receiving laforaation there of an lapendlnf raid whloJi has not yet reached Kuwait, and Is arran^in^ for a special warning signal to be displayed on the fort at Jahrah In such cases. Had this Krranfcement been In force on the 2tnt January the oar In which Colonel .'atacn was travel ling rculd have been stopped at Tahrah. The nhalKh fiocordlnely thinks it desirable that a set of rules should be drawn up for the regulation of traffic on his portion of the road, and wishes me to ask to what extent you would be prepared to uo-operatt in orlngln^ in a standard ^et of rules for both. The rules which sorest theaselves to his are:- no unarmed car shall be ailowsd to leave, unless it be accoapanled by another car which is araed. ^2) No ci-r to be allowed to leave later than four hours before sunset. ^3) No oar to be allowed to leave unless the driver or soae other person in It hold a licence showiag that e has the requisite knowledge of the Desert, or unless It accoapanled by a car which ooaplles with this rule. (4) All persons in charge of oars to understand that11 \ (4) If the 'danger' sl&amp;nftl be flowa on Jahrah Fort they ar# to re*»ln at the fcrt, and not proceed further elthout per- nitsion* (5) No paeserifcer to travel by one of the Kuwait - 'Iran Motor Tranaport Jojpany's oars without a tloke^ and no private oar to travel without a toll receipt front that Goapaay In reapegt of the Kuwait portion of the road, on both of whloh It shall bff» printed in Arabic and Sn^lleh that the holder realises and accepts the rlaits which he la running I have the honour to be # Sir, Your atoat obedient servant.

He may even have 'been influenced 'by this desire in deciding that raiders were too strong to take opposition actively when I suggest ed on March 3rd that he should send ott cars after them as he had done last year. It would of course 'be a very different matter if he allowed UBABDAR to join MUTAIR in a raid on a Mesopotamian trihe or to keep plunder taken in such a raid . Such a thing could not 'be tolerated if true. But presumably I do not 'believe accusation. I have very high opinion of (xluhhs* ability 'but he is not infallible. When one con siders how suspicious Mesopotamian sherperd tribes must be at present of any one of NEJD type to which URASDAR belongs it would be strange if there were no rumours of thisrsort about. Moreover there are of course people in Mesopotamia who would like to see Kuwait made part of that country,and it is not inconceivable that such persons might encourage any such anti-Kuwait rumours as propa ganda. URABDARS are not paragons and I know that like all bedouin a raid might appeal to some of theiji,but they could hardly have expected to participate in a raid so close to the town(2) 1^- without ruler knowing particulars and he would certainly never appQ\^ve. I have already discussed question with Sheikh.

(i) Ibn Saud moved from Kiyadh to iiuraidah at the be ginning of March and has ^iven out t^iat he is collecting forces to subdue refractory section of Ataibah, nutair and Ajman tribes which have been responsible for recent raids. (ii) There have been strong rumours that ibn Jiluwi Governor of Hasa, at Ibn Saud's instructions was collecting forces of Hasa tribes to co-operate. Latest reports state there are some doubts on truth of these rumours. (iii) Ibn Humaid (Ataibah) Faisal al Dawish (Mutair) and Ibn Hithlain (Ajman) against which ibn Saud's prepara tions are said to be directed appear apprehensive, ibn Humaid after his recent raiding expeditions to Hazul area has travelled rapidly south and has probably joined forces with Dawish between AJibba and Artiwiyah. ibix Hithlain's force and certain Mutair section under ibn shuqair, ibn Fughm and Ibn Lami are reported between southern border of Kuwait and Al Safa protecting the flanics of main Mutair force from Ibn Jiluwi, while threatening to raid •Iraq tribe through Kuwait territory. (iY) It is doubtful whether ibn Saud really intends to attack rebellious sheikhs or merely to bring them to terms. Tribal opinion discredits former alternative and it is sig nificant tiiat Ibn Musaad of Hail appears to be taking no action so that Ibn Saud's forces are unlikely to be greatly . . ' Uo superior in number. Moreover he may ^ reluctant to force an issue at a time when pilgrimage is imminent and will re- I- a - requirijqpcxkjt his presence in the Hedjaa. (v) In the meantime diversion caused by ibn baud's activity may diminish imrflediate threat concerning Ikhwan vaxd on 'Iraq tribe(s} but so long as ssituation reiaains unstable danger of sporadic raid will remain. If Ibn Saud means business and delivers successful attack we may expect influx^refugees. 1 consider in this A case that those guilty of recent raid should be prevented if necessary by force from entering 'Iraq and escaping just punishment b^ Ibn Saud* .But in more probable event of their fleeing to Kuwait question becomes difficult and can only be dealt with in light of future development. - highcoma - ***** I \ u Pol- Pi-', ru-—&gt; -Telegram P.

Adhaira, dated the 12th March, 1929 # 15 th To: The Adviser, Ministry of Interior, Baghdad Subject, RELATION WITH KUWAIT. As is well known, the principality of Kuwait was until a few years ago, one of the chief powers in Arabia, and dealt on an equal footing with Ibn Sa^d, Ibn Rashid and the Sharif. Though his territory was not so very extensive nor his tribes so numerous as those of his allies or rivals, his financial resources, chiefly derived from pearling, were considerable. Moreover the Kuwait deserts, though not comparatively very extensive, supply most excellent grazing, and the Ajman, Mutair, Rashaidah, Awazim and other large tribes have frequently in the past placed themselves under the protection of the Shaikh, The present Shaikh from the time of his accessionj however, has shown himself completely incapable of dealing with the crisis with which the Akhwan menace have threatened his town. Almost all the tribes which owned allegiance to Kuwait when Ahmad ibn Subah succeeded, have gone over to the Akhwan, Many of them, such as the Awazim, continue to live in Kuwait territory, but own allegiance to Ibn Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa, who taxes them and orders them about within the boundaries of Kuwait. The miserable remnants of the Kuwait tribes have, for the last two ori.three years, spent most of their time coyering beneath the walls of the town. Although Ibn Subah is generally reputed to have plenty of money, he does not seem to relish spending it on defending his country. This year, however, the situation has taken on an entirelyentirely new aspect. ij'or the past 18 months, ever since the Duwish has been virtually in revolt against Ibn Sa^d, he has endeavoured to secure an ally in Ibn Subah. All bedouins ha^3 to purcnase their necessities in some coast or river town a bedouin banned by the authorities of all the towns, can be brought to book without fighting. Mutair, threatened by a blockade on one side in liajd, and on the o ther in » Iraq, were until recently in a very awkward position. Last autumn, however the .buwish and Ibn Sub ah made a private agreement, according to which the latter would break the blockades of both Ibn Sa^d | and the 'Iraq Government and throw Kuwait open to Mutair, on condition that the Duwish promised not to raid Kuwait any more. This agreement has since ripened into a regular alliance, and the Shaikh has undoubtedly not only opened Kuwait to Mutair but has helped the rebellious Akhwan, AJman as well as Mutair, in every possible way. It is even reported that he has made gifts of money, arms and ammunition to Mutair, but this cannot at present be proved. The Shaikh, however, does not of course desire entirely to alienate His Majesty's Government. He therefore denies his shady transactions with Mutair, and even endeavours to maintain an appearance of friendship by doling out occasional bits of intelligence to the Political Agent. THE IBN HITHLAIN RAH) . It is not easy to prove anything against Ibn Subah in the case of the Ibn Kithlain rlad, except in so far as it may be said that a large part of the tribal group subject to Jiuwait and known as Araibdar, are themselves AJman and that details of all the movements and intentions of the Akhwan Ajman are daily known in Kuwait. Moreover Ibn Subah had probably received a prior assurance from Ibn Hithlain that he would not raid .Kuwait tribes. On his return from his successful raid on the 'Iraq shepherds Ibn Hithlaiit ac tually passed Jahrah and camped at Umm Rus, where, he divided the loot. Ibn Kithlaiai had only about 140 men, whereas Ibn Subah can certainly raise four or five hundred horse and camelmen. Yet^et not a sho^t was fired by the Kuwaitis. This may perh 'be attributed to the weakness or cowardice rather than treachery. Still weakness and cowardice are not desirable qualities in one who professes to be an ally. •* 3 — Since then, however, affairs have become far worse. There can be little doubt, from innumerable reports, that Araibdar have been acting as regular spies for the Ajman and Mutair for the past month. In this connection, please see this office telegrams ^os. 533, 360 of 11-2-29, 12-2-29, respectively. Sa'ud ibn Hajruf is one of Ibn Subah's principal men. The crowning disgrace of these altogether shady incidents, however, was the recent raid by Ibn Shqair. As already explained to the Ministry, almost the whole of the Bani Malik dira has been awarded to Kuwait in the Anglo-lMajd-Kuwait agreements. Ibn Subah has long been a patron of this tribe. At the time of Ibn Hithlain's raid, the greater part of i3ani Malik fled to Safwan, A portion of the tribe, however, took refuge with Araibdar, with the idea of placing themselves under the protection of Ibn Subah. In accordance with this plan, it is reported that, on joining Araibdar, they visited Ibn Subah, and presented him with tribute in the form of 'dhibihas'. It is stated that this tribute was accepted. By Arab custom, the acceptance of such 'khawa' involves a moral obligation to delend the giver, even with one's life. Anyone who does not propose to defend the givers of 'khawa' should refuse to accept the latter. intention of raiding »Iraq tribes in the Umm al Madafa -Raudhatain area, as had been successfully done by Ibn Hithlain. On reaching Aba al Hiran, however, (Abu al Haram on map) they received reports of air reconnaissances and car patrols in front of these tribes. They had no desire to fight a battle or risk losses, but, according to the almost invariable Akhwan habit, they hoped to surprise a camp which they could outnumber by ten to one, and massacre it without loss. They therefore abandoned the idea of raiding in the Umm al Madafa area, and went into camp. IBN SHQ.AIR 1 s RAID . Ibn Shqair and Al Fugham originally moved up, with the AtAt this stage, they heard of the presence of 'Iraq shepherds with Araibdar. They had received instructions from the Puwish not to raid Araibdar themselves, as Ibn SubeJa was an al^y of Mu^air. But here was a small camp (about fifty men to their five hundred) of 1 Iraq subjects, who had innocently placed them selves under the protection of an ally of the Duwish. Ibn Shqair accordingly sent a messenger to Ibn Subah, warning him to move Araibdar away from the shepherds, as the Muslimin were about to raid the latter. On receiving this message, Araibdar hastily moved south and camped close to iHutair, leaving the shepherds alone at Jahrah, The latter fled to Kuwait where they camped beneath the walls of the town, and appealed to Ibn Subah. It is stated that Ibn Subah said to Ibn Shqai^s messenger that Mutair could not raid the shepherds in their then position which was almost in Kuwait bazaar, but that they could do so as they liked if the shepherds moved a little way off. Mutair accordingly picqueted the shepherd camp and also placed men in Kuwait town and Jahrah, to watch for any sign of movement by the shepherds. A patrol car from Bani Malik at Safwan, accompanied by a camel constable in ple,in clothes, at this time visited Jahrah to obtain news. They report that they saw a number of Akhwan camelmen staying in the house of one of Ibn Subah 1 s men in Jahrah village. On enquiring they were told that these men werfe the scouts of Ibn Shqair 1 s raiding party. The shepherds at Kuwait at this time sent a message to the Administrative Inspector, asking for help. The Administrative Inspector cross questioned the messenger carefully as to whether the camp was in any danger at the moment. He, (the son of Shaikh of Bani Malik) replied 'oh no i they are quite safe where they are. They are almost in Kuwait town. But they cannot get out without risk, as they are surrounded by scouts of the raiders, who are also sitting in Kuwait and Jahrah M , i\obody imagined it possible that Ibn Subah would allow/ the shepherds, who(^pl who, to Arafe ictees, were under his protection, to be rained at the very gates of hie town. The Administrative Inspector therefore sent his telegram Ho.558 of 26-2-29. to Air Headquarters, asking for assistance to escort the shepherds back from Kuwait, but, in Air Headquarters' telegram Eo. JB/l of 1/5/29, the request was refused. He thereupon sent the messenger back to xiani Malik, with instructions to arrange a date with them on which he (the Administrative Inspector) with the police would meet them back. The/ day after, however, the camp was raided. The Administrative Inspector has since examined the tracks of Ibn Shqair's raiding party, when they advanced to attack. They crossed A1 Shaqq north of Miniaqish and must have passed almost through the camps of Araibdar. While this march was of course accomplished at night, yet if Araibdaf had sent word to the shepherds during the previous night or ever, an hour before the attack, the majority of them could have 1 crowded into the market place within the ****** town walls. It is even alleged that the night before the attack Ibn Subah sent messengers to warn Araibdar, but I have not found any proof of this allegation. The attack took place on a level plain extending from the walls of the town to a distance of about three or four- miles away. Police who examined the site state that the tracKE of the charging horses of the raiders wheeled only a few hundred y^ards from the town walls. The noise of shots, and the shouts and shrieks of the combatants and victims, were heard by people in their houses in Jiuwait. As soon as the raid began, the Shaikh ordered the town gates to be closed. A number of the men of Jiani Malik were inside the town. laad with excitement at hearing the shout and cries of the sons and brothers outside, they struggled to get out to their assistance, but it is said that the Shaikh's men ■k I - 6 - (S) r ^11 t men refused to open the gates and beat back the shepherds with blows and the flats of their swords. Meanwhile on the level plain outside the walls, the Akhwan were busy slaughtering. They outnumbered the shepherds by about ten to one. There was no way of escape, behind them was the sea, and to their flank the town walls. It is said that about four men took refuge in a ruined building near the walls, where they opened a heavy fire and repulsed their pursuers. The remainder of the camp was exterminated, ^ever has the present writer heard of a more disgraceful or brutal incident in the history of Arabia. Kuwait is a large town and the Shaikh has hundreds of retainers. If theee men had even manned the walls and opened the gates to the fugitives, some survivors could have found shelter. MUSABLAK . It is well known that all bedouins depend entirely on towns for the purchase of their necessities, and if access to towns can be forbidden to the*, they car. be brought to obedience without fighting. Bow it is not a question of Ibn Subah maintaining neutrality between -Iraq and Ibn Sa'ud. Mutair and their allies are outlaws, rebels against Ibn Sa'ud and hostile to Kis Majesty's Government and -Iraq. Both Ibn Sa'ud and 'Iraq have for several months attempted to enforce a blockade against them, with the result that, by last autumn, they were in consider- able straits. The Buwish then made a private agreement with Ibn Subah. promising security to the latter's subjects from Akhwan raids, on condition that the Shaikh supplied the rebel,* Akhwan with food and other necessities from Kuwait. The bargain has been observed. The Duwish has warned all the Akhwan that no Kuwait tribes are to be interfered with, and Kuwait town has been filled with Mutair caravans since last autumn up to the preaent day. imtair have ample money, sheep and property taken in the ir- 7 - in their many raids on 'Iraq and now that they have secured the alliance of one of the principal ports in Arabia in which to dispose of their loot and buy supplies there is no reason why they should not hold out against Ibn Sa'ud and the Government indefinitely. This is Ibn Subah 1 s chief crime. he may argue that he was not bound to help Bani Malik and he may deny that Araibdar are assisting the Akhwan, but he cannot get away from the fact that he himself is definitely prolonging the present state of chaos by supplying the rebel Ahhwan with those necessities which both Ibn Sa^d and the Government are attempting to deny them. Incidentally ammunition, which is very scarce in 1 Iraq owing to Government measures, is said to be both cheap and plentiful in Kuwait, where the Akhwan are purchasing it freely. There can be no doubt that the prolonga tion of the present state of chaos due to the Duwish - Ibn Subah alliance is costing and will cost His Majesty's Government large sums of money. Unless His Majesty* s Government is willing to bring pressure to bear on Ibn Subah to enforce a blockage as is being done by 'Iraq and Ibn Sa'ud, there is little prospect of peace on the Kajd frontier.

To The Adviser, Ministry of Interior, Baghdadi Subject:- K3LATI0NS WITH KIP//AIT . My No.754 of 15th March, 1929. On 14/3/29, I met Lt.-Col. Moore, Political Resident in Kuwait. He showed me a telegram received by him from His Excellency the High Commissioner with reference to my telegram No.696 of 10th March, 1929, and his draft reply thereto* In regard to the latter, I think that the suggestion that rumours to the discredit of Kuwait may be circulated by persons in Iraq who desire to see Kuwait annexed to that country, is rather far fetched. The allegations in question have all been made by the local 'Iraq nomad tribes, who are indignant because they believe that Araibdar are assisting the Akhwan to raid them. These tribesmen have only the vaguest idea of the political relations between Kuwait, ♦Iraq and His Majesty's Government, and it can scarcely be imagined that they are actuated by political aims when they accuse Araibdar of having their sheep. Since writing my No.754 of 15/3/29, I have obtained the following further details from Bani Malik who were raided at Kuwait. The Khirsan section of Bani Malik alone gave 'khawa' to Ibn Subah. The ,, khawa M was accepted, and the chiefs were presented with ziboons and told to camp with/*! -2- with Araibdar, Sncouraged lay this recaption, portions of the Shuraifat, Tu'us, Shillib and other sections joined the Khirsan. All csunped with Araibdar near Jahrah. Everybody knew that Araibdar were friendly with Mutair, and there were many Akhwan always coming and going in their camps. One day Abdulla al Jabir, brother of Shaikh Ahmad, arrived at Jahrah. Here, before a large concourse, including Araibdar, Bani Malik and many Akhwan, he said M the Akhwan are coming to raid the Muntafik shepherds. Araibdar must separate from them* Ibn Subah has nothing to do with the Muntafik'. The shepherds were dumbfounded by this sudden blow. They held a hasty consultation. Some were for a night flight towards Safwan, and others for fleeing to Kuwait. The former was sixty miles away, while it was only fifteen miles to Kuwait, The impression conveyed by Abdullah al Jabir'a speech was that the Akhwan were about to attack any moment. The shepherds were therefore afraid to risk the long march to Safwan unprotected, and decided to flee to Kuwait, camp beneath the walls, and send a message to the Administrative Inspector asking for help. It never entered their minds (or anyone one else^s) that they would be attacked beneath the walls of Kuwait, They complain bitterly of Abdullah al Jabir's conduct in saying publicly before Araibdar and the Akhwan that Ibn Subah would not interfere to protect them. If, they say, Abdullah had, instead of this, taken them quietly aside and said w look here, you are going to be raided and we cannot protect you, so you had better retire to 'Iraq', they would have sneaked away the same night to Saf .van. As-3- As regards the battle, the shepherds appear to have put up a magnificlent resistence. It is now stated that they killed about thirty of the raiders, seventeen mares and many riding camels. It is thought that twenty five of the shepherds were killed, and about fifteen survived, having taken refuge in some detached buildings outside the walls.. The action raged for four hours, during any time of which the intervention of even thirty or forty fresh men from the town would have sufficed to repel the raiders. During ail these hours, however, the gates remained closed. Orowds of spectators on the wails (the final scenes of the battle, as attested by the dead horses still lying there, were only two to four hundred yards from the walls) witnessed this tragic contest of five hundred against forty. Nothing more brutal can be imagined since the days of the Roman Gladiators. It is stated that the many men within the town, not only shepherds but sympathisers disgusted at this brutal slaughter, struggled to get out of the gates to assist the shepherds, but were prevented by the Shaikh»s men. The Khirsan section were massacred and raided with others, inspite of their tt khawa M and Ibn Subah»3 'Wajh w . Bani Malik are absolutely positive in their assertions that Araibdar themselves Joined in the raid. Firstly there seems to be no doubt that the raiders, in tne night march previous to the attack, actually passed through the Araibdar camps. If any man of Araibdar had cantered on ahead he could have warned the shepherds# The latter swear that at least two of the mares killed were recognised as belonging to Araibdar. It is even said that one of the Hajruf Family, the Amirs of Araibdar under Ibn Subah, was killed. One Khalaif al 3ashag, a ohaikh of the Shuraifat, alleges that his women, who stayed in his tenttent during the raid, informed him that the raiders came into the tent accompanied by a woman, and began to loot. The woman asked to whom the tent belonged, and on being told Khalaif al Bashag, she said to the raiders 'Khatiya I let us leave Khalaif^s tent'. It is of course unknown for women to accompany a raid and anyhow a Mutair woman would not know who Khalaif al Bashag was. The shepherds believe that these people were from some Araibdar camps close by. Flight Lieut. Howes informs me that he knows the name of at least one man of Araibdar who was with the raiders# I do not imagine that the Shaikh of Kuwait would order Araibdar to raid the shepherds. In fact, if they did so, the Shaikh was probably unaware of the fact until after it had occurred. Bedouins are naturally covetous and all sorts of rag-tag and bobtail join in raids. Still the Shaikh is responsible for his tribes. A.fter the bombing, a large number of B ani Malik sheep and donkeys scattered about the vicinity and were collected by Araibdar. The shepherds went out with a representative of the Shaikh and collected what they could find. They complain, however, that Araibdar extorted money from them before consenting to hand over their property. One man says that ho was oompellad to pay Rs.lS/- to recover three of his donkeys. The average value of a donkey is about Rs.8/- each, so that, if his statement is true, he very nearly bought his donkeys back. Another man alleges that he was made to pay Rs. 5/- for two donkeys. I was infomed by the shepherds that a minor chief of the Bani Malik called HaJJi Za'airi, was killed in the raid, and his mare wounded. All his worHly property was looted. The mare was subsequently caught by Ibn Subah's men and taken to the Shaikh.Shaikh. Some of the shepherds went to the Shaikh to ask for the mare, which they hoped to sell for the benefit of the family of Hajji Za»airi. They allege, however, that Abdullah al Jabir, the Shaikhs brother, refused to hand it over unless a fee of five majidis was paid* As the family of the deceased Hajji Za»airi were completely penniless, they could not raise this sum, and the mare is still with Ibn Subah* The shepherds, many of whom after the raid had only the clothes they stood up in, and were moreover burdened with large numbers of women all of whose menfolk had been killed, complain bitterly that no one in Kuwait would so much as give them a meal. On the contrary, they state that the Kuwaitis took advantage of their situation to endeavour to make money. Some who desired to visit the scene of the bombing to co^llect any of their property left behind by the raiders, were asked exorbitant prices for the hire of a cart or horse. When they were infonned by the Special Service Officer that cars would come to Kuwait to escort the refugees back to the T Iraq tribes, the Kuwaitis did all they could to persuade the shepherds not to leave, witi. *ne idea of buying their remaining sheep from them at a low price. This fact is attested to by outside witnesses. In regard to the battle, and the non -interference of the Shaikh, many of the shepherds and others,including a plain clothes constable of the Camel Corps, allege that the Shaikh stated in public that he was prevented from coming to the assistance of the shepherds by or ers from His Majesty 1 s Government and the Political Resident. Some also state that he said that, previous to the engagementQju) r -6- enga^ement, Government had told him to evict the shep^3- Is and not protect them. All the above statements are of course derived from tribal sources. I cannot absolutely vouch for them. I think, however, that there can be no doubt whatever that the shepherds and the Iraq tribes generally, a-a absolutely convinced of the complicity of Araibdar in the raid. Should you desire to press the question further, I suggest that sworn statements be taken from the ^ani Malik refugees. I attach a list of losses of Bani Malik property, compiled by Flight Lieut. Howes in Kuwait. He tells me that he has sent a list of the icilled to Air Headquarters, but he did not send me a copy. The total of deaths was, I believe, twenty five. Sd. J. B.

Murch, 1929.

On one occasion onl^ hss an Akhv/an raiding party penetrated into 'Iraq territory - 1 refer to the atteupteo rnic by Ibn Ashwan near Jumaimah on lecemoer 29th - and on that occasion the raiders were iMnedisteiy located imd bombed by machines of the Koyal Air ^orce. here ' Irac tribes h??ve been succe sfully raided in ivuwait or linjd territory, thore tribes had, contrary to. or in ignorance of, Captain Glubb* s orders, strayed in search of ^raisint beyond the xones of paiety afforded The Right Hon 1 ble L # C.M # .i, Amery, A.I., Secretary of otate for the 'olonies, 7 owning LJtreet, London, ij, !•- 2 afforded by the denert poete ^-nd by the mobile forces allotted for trib:1 protection. ii) The failure of so mr &gt;rjy ot temp ted raide muBt b^ attributed mainly to the defenarre meaeurea t^ken in the southern deaert area. These mesaurea comprise, first, the collection and rapid communication to headquarter8 of intelligence ret»rdin£, the movements and intentions of AJkbwan raiding parties, secondly the withdrawal of scattered tribes from threatened districts and th ir concentration in areas v/hare they c»n be to some extent controlled and protected ( a tasK which has b en greatly co«j[ 1 ics^ted by the lacK ol watei and ^raaini in the southern desert) »nd thirdly the mainten»nce of a cloae watch on threatened points and the prompt location and enga*ement of raiding parties, iii) In connection with the desert posts wl.ich play an important part in these defence measures both as administrative and intelliience centres and also as advanced bpses for air and ground lorces, you will observe tnat whereas the Akhwan leaders have at various times expresam their intention of destroy in*, them, the raiders i^ave in point of fact been careful to keep at a respectful distance and have concentrated on areas, such as northern K.uw it, where no euch posts exist. r?) At the same time, although many attempted raids have been frustrated, the raiders are not entirely deterred thereby from renewing, their attempts. 1 believe1 jv \ ■ ' beliave this to be largely ciue to the fact that it has not bo far teen poenible to strike a decisive blow at the raiders who hat# on more than one occauion bec:n able to encape across the frontiei with their loot 2, 1 have thought it advisable to brin^ these points to your notice, because it Feems possible that the fr-ct that threatened raids haTe so often failed to materialise may ^ iTe the ertoneous imprests ion that the threats newer exiwted. King Ibn has ine'eed protested recently against the circulation of elarnist rumours of impendine raids which he claims to be unfounded. Actually, as you will observe from the enclosed eummary, these so caller rumours heve usually been fully substan tiated. Kint Ibn Sa^d has also contended, as reported in telei rf»m i.\O c 28 datec the 10th ol karch § 1^29, from His Majesty 's A^ent ^nd Consul, Jiddah, to the Foreign Office, that the raidiiu, propensities of certain of his tribesnen are due to military measures and concentrationB on the f Iraq side of the frontier. As I hare shown, the necessary and justifiable defence measures tnken on the ♦Iraq side of the frontier have in fact been instrumental in averting a number of raids with their attendant loss of life and property. That the raiding propensities of the Akhwan have not been more efficiently dincouraj ed s. emc due rather to the fact that the military neasmres taken on the 'Iraq- 2 - 2, Gai«uma concentration . At the end of December reports from many source■ indicated the presence of a large concentration of Najd tribesmen at Gaisuma threatening the Uraq Anaisah in the Wadian area. Precautionary measures were taken and maintained until January II, when reports showed that threatened raid had been abandoned and the conoentra- tion dispersed. The bombing of the Uutair raiding party near Jumaimah on December 29 may have been a contributory factor, 3, AJman &amp; Mutair raidin g parties in Kuwait , Date, Jany,21, Feby,14, Psby,22, Maroh 3, Leader.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 1389/3/91] No. 1. Sir Austen Chamberlain to Mr. Jakins {Jeddah). (No. 63.) Sir, Foreign Office, March 27, 1929. Mr . BIRD'S despatches Nos. 43 of the 7th February, 46 and 48 of the 10th February, his telegrams Nos. 20 and 21 of the 10th February, and your telegram No. 29 of the 10th March, transmitted various complaints from King Tbn Sand, and from the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs, in respect of (1) the action taken by British aircraft against the abortive raid of Ibn Ashwan against Iraqi shepherd tribes on the 29th December last; (2) the general conduct of Captain Glubb in his administration of the southern desert area of Iraq; and (3) the interpretation placed by His Majesty's Government on article 6 of the Bahra Agreement. These complaints have been considered bv His Majesty's Government, in consultation with the High Commissioner for Iraq, with the following result:— 2. The question of the raid of Ibn Ashwan on the 29th December last was dealt with in paragraph 2 of Ibn Saud's note of the 22nd January, of which a translation was enclosed in Mr. Bird's despatch No. 43 of the 7th February. As you will have seen from Sir C. Clayton's telegram No. 98 of the 5th March to the Colonial Office, repeated to you as No. 25, the statements made by Ibn Sand in this note are not accurate. The fact that Ibn Ashwan's party were riding within Iraqi territory two on a camel, unencumbered by baggage, and opened fire on British aircraft before the latter attacked them is in itself conclusive evidence of the fact that the party were not peaceful shepherds, as represented by Ibn Sand. You should accordingly address a note to Ibn Saud in this sense in reply to paragraph 2 of His Majesty's note of the 22nd January, and add that His Majesty's Government cannot accept his version of the incident and must repudiate the claim for compensation which His Majesty has put forward in connexion therewith. On the contrary His Majesty's Government look to King Ibn Saud to secure the adequate punishment of the raiders concerned. 3. As regards the alleged activities of Captain Glubb in his administration of the desert area, the Secretary of State is in general agreement with the views expressed by Sir G. Clayton in his telegram referred to above, and in Mr. Bourdillon's telegrams Nos. 74 and 75 of the 20th February to the Colonial Office, repeated to you as Nos. 70 and 18. Apart from the fact that no proof of any kind is adduced in support of the sweeping accusations brought against Captain Glubb, it has been the experience of His Majesty's Government in the past that allegations of provocative action on the part of the Iraqi authorities have frequently preceded a series of raids from Nejd, and His Majesty's Government cannot but feel that the present protests, coming as they have just before the raids on the Iraqi Saiyyad in Nejd on the 19th February and on Iraqi shepherds in Koweit on the 3rd March, have been, to some extent at least, intended as anticipatory excuses for the conduct of the Nejdian tribes concerned. It is undesirable, however, that this general question should be pursued further in writing, and you should therefore restrict yourself to making an oral communication on the lines of this paragraph should a suitable occasion present itself. 4. As regards Captain Glubb's alleged infringement of article 5 of the Bahra Agreement by corresponding direct with the Nejdian Amir of Hail (see Mr. Bird's telegram No. 20 of the 10th February), I am to enclose the accompanying copies of Colonial Office telegram No. 84 of the 5th March to Sir G. Clayton and of Sir G. Clayton's reply No. 102 of the 7th March on this subject. The question of direct communication between the Amir of Hail and the Iraqi administrative authorities in the southern desert area was dealt with in the correspondence ending with Jeddah telegram No. 46 to the Foreign Office of the 1st May, 1926, and, in view of the arrangements then made, the present complaint appears to be entirely without substance. It seems unnecessary, therefore, to pursue this point further in writing, but you may, should you consider that any useful purpose would be served thereby, remind Fuad Hamza of the arrangements made in 1926, and explain that the Hejazi complaint in this respect cannot be accepted by His Majesty's Government. [735 dd—2]2 5. The charge that Nejdian tribes have been illegally threatened with expulsion while camped in Iraq (see Mr. Bird's telegram j\o. 20 oi the 10th February and ruad Hamza's note of the 5th February enclosed in Mr. Birds despatch No. 46 ot the 10th February) is in complete contradiction with the complaint that Captain Glubb was seducing the Nejdian Shammar from their allegiance to Ibn Saud, put torward in Fuad Hamza's note of the 31st December last, of which a copy was enclosed in your despatch No. 17 of the 8th January. The attitude of the Iraqi authorities m regard to the movements of Nejdian tribesmen across the irontier, and their anxiety to fulfil the obligations which they have undertaken towards Ibn Saud in this respect, were explained in Sir H. Dobbs s letter of the 5th January to King Ibn Saud, of which a copy was forwarded to you direct in Mr. Bourdillon's letter No. S O. 24 ol the same date, and in Mr. Bourdillon's telegrams Nos. 74 and 75 of the 20th lebruary to the Colonial Office, referred to above. In view of the explanations already given to King Ibn Saud and the Hejazi Government on this point. Sir Austen ( hamberlain considers that'little would be gained by continuing this correspondence and returning ^ detailed replies to the recent series of complaints. You may, however, communicate to the Hejazi Government, orally, the substance of Mr. Bourdillon's telegrams Nos. 74 and 75 to the Colonial Office, if you think it desirable to do so, and you should in any case inform the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in writing that full oPzplanations have already been given to the Hejazi (lovernment on this subject, and that, after close investigation, His Majesty's Government are satisfied that there is no foundation for the allegations which have been made against Captain Glubb s activities, which are clearly based upon inaccurate reports. You should add that the continued presentation of baseless protests can only further complicate an already difficult situation, and you may point out the obvious interest which such admittedly recalcitrant tribes as the Mutair must have, in representing their delinquencies as the result of Iraqi provocation. If the Hejazi (Government prefer to give greater credence to their own sources of information than to the official assurances of His Majesty's Government, their action can only remain a matter of regret to His Majesty's Government. 6. You should at the same time request Sheikh Fuad Hamza orally, with reference to his note of the 31st December, to produce, in original, the documents alleged to be in Captain Glubb's handwriting and stated to prove his interference in the affairs of Nejdi tribes. You should, in making this request, explain that His Majesty's Government had no previous knowledge of the existence of these documents and clearly cannot accept them as genuine without close examination of the originals, said to be in the hands of the Hejazi Government. 7. As regards article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, the Secretary of State approves the language held on this subject by Mr. Bird, as reported in paragraph 5 of his despatch No. 48 of the 10th February. The Secretary of State realises that Ibn Saud is unlikely to acquiesce in the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Govern ment in this matter, but the obligations of His Majesty's Government render it indispensable that that attitude should be maintained. You should accordingly address a separate written communication to the Hejazi Government on this question, confirming the statements made by Mr. Bird, as reported in paragraph 5 (but not the other paragraphs) of his despatch No. 48, and explaining, in reply to Ibn Sand's letter of the 23rd January, that the statement made by His Majesty in that letter, to the effect that His Majesty's Government are now attemping to attach a condition to their undertaking to be bound by the article, does not correctly represent the position. On the contrary. His Majesty's Government have assured the Hejazi Government that they intend to observe the provisions of that article, and they recognise that British'forces in Iraq, as well as Iraqi forces, are covered by its terms. The^position is, indeed, that His Majesty's Government have every intention and desire to observe the provisions of the article, and will naturally continue to do so, so long as a normal situation exists. They have, however, thought it only fair to warn thelHejazi Government that, in the event of a situation of grave danger to Iraq being brought about by the actual occurrence of a serious attack on a large scale against a township in Iraq, or of continuous raiding by Nejdian tribes, which the Hejazi Government prove unable to prevent or punish, His Majesty's Government must reserve their liberty of action and their right to take the necessary measures against those guilty of the'attack, if this should prove, in their opinion, the only means of defending the Iraqi tribes, for whose safety they are responsible, from further aggression. If, however, the Hejazi Government would establish the same degree of control over their tribes as has recently been enforced by the Iraqi Government, who( have effectively restrained their tribes from raiding into Nejd, there would be no occasion for British forces to cross the frontier in any circumstances and thus no hesitation on the part of His Majesty's Government in falling in with the wishes of the Hejazi Government in the matter of article 6 of the Bahra Agreement. 8. You should add orally that His Majesty's Government feel bound to point out that they cannot in any case allow unprovoked raiding against Iraqi tribes to continue with the almost complete impunity which the raiders at present enjoy. Six raids against Iraqi tribes have taken place since the end of December last, and, so far as His Majesty's Government are aware, no effective action has yet been taken by the Hejazi Government to punish the offenders or to make reparation for the Iraqi losses. These raids have not only resulted in heavy losses to Iraqi tribes, but have led to the death of a British aircraftsman and of an American missionary. The latest of these raids has been reported by the British air officers engaged to have been of a particularly impudent nature, in that the raiders, having recrossed the Nejd frontier, and relying upon their immunity from pursuit in virtue of article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, halted in the open and, within easy reach of British aircraft, proceeded to the distribution of their loot. In the face of such provocation, His Majesty's Government cannot be expected to hold their hand indefinitely. I am, &amp;c. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

On 19th May, 1926, Ibn Saud was informed that the necessary instructions had been sent to Mutesarrif, Basra, Muntafiq and Diwaniyah (no names were mentioned), and he replied in July confirming arrange ments for direct correspondence between Hail and the local Iraq authorities, ' particularly those mentioned.' Though Ibn Saud was not specifically informed of Glubb's appointment to the southern desert Liwa, which was formed in 1928 and includes the desert portion of three Liwas mentioned, it was referred to during Jeddah negotiations in May 1928. I think objection to Glubb personally emanates from Fuad Hamza himself rather than Ibn Saudj who would be unlikely to support such unwarranted aspersions on our sincerity or Glubb's honesty of purpose.From.

The Hon'ble the Political Reeident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R S. Sir, Attitude of the Shaikh of Kuwait. I hare the honour to refer to letter No.S.0.673 dated the 2let March I929 froa the Political Secretary to His Excellency the High Gonaissioner for 'Iraq relatire to the attitude of Hi« Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with the recent I3chw£n raids on 'Iraq tribe*, ae depicted in two note® by Captain J, B. Glubb, G.3.E., M # 0», Adaini»tratiye Inspector in charge of the Southern Desert of 'Iraq, who is at present in charge of the 'Iraq tribes in Kuwait territory. In ay opinion Captain Glubb's notes are wildly extraragant, and conrey an altogether exaggerated idea of the true facts of the case. Had I read the* a aonth ago, I should hare been amazed that Captain Glubb could hare written the*, but since the 'Iraq tribes hare in Kuwait territory I hare naturally had a great deal of correspond ence with hi* regarding complaints put forward by Kuwait subjects against 'Iraq tribesmen or by 'Iraq tribesmen against Kuwaitis, and, although I hare nothing but praise for the assistance he has giren in the former type of case it has been impossible for me not to notice in the latter how ready he is to beliere aaythinK discreditable to Kuwait which an 'Iraq tribesman likes to tell him. As examples of # the above the following instances will suffice to prore(a) , what I saj:- On the 21st March he wrote to me that some men of the Dhafir had complained that, as thej were returning from . Kuwait the previous evening, they had been attacked near Jahrah by two partie» of camelmen - one of three and the other of four men. The Dhaffr had succeeded In driving off their assailanta who had retired to a camp of the 'Uraibdar near by, I gave Captain Glub^s man a letter to the Shallch and told him t6 take the actual Dhaffr to whom the alleged incident had occurred with him so that they could give him all possible details. They, however, told a totally differ ent story from what Captain Glubb had written. They said that when they got to near the Mutla' (four miles on the other side of Jahrah) on their way to - not from - Kuwait, they saw a man watching them from some little distance off and another man with three camels. They called out and asked If they were Dhaffr, whereupon the man went to the camela and they all went off towards t he north , where they pre sumably went to a camp of the Zaiyad tribe of 'Iraq - there were certainly no 'Uraibdar in that directioa* The Dhaffr further said that they had never actually seen Captain Glubb himself at all. On the 24th March Captain G-lubb wrote to me that he was sending in one of his men to me who said that he,with| representatives of the Bani Malik, had found six sheep belonging to the latter with one of the 'Uraibdar. This man had alleged that he had bought the sheep from a caravan coming down from Najd. His man consequently had left the sheep, as custom does not permit the fo rcible rest itution of of animals f ound i n t he possessi on of a fri endl y -orioe wno who bought them from the enemy. In view, however, of a previous case in which the Shaikh had pointed out that it is the Bedouin custom that if anyone recognize his property in a case of this sort, and can produce witnesses to prove that it is his, it is his right to have it returned to him with out having to compensate the man who had bought it, and that f i(3) Erl it Is up to the latter to get his noney back: from the man he bought it from, and that anyone who buys an animal from another without safeguarding himself with a definite assur ance, given by the seller in the presence of witnesses,that the money will be returned if the beast is proved to belong to someone else, obviously does so at his own rislc# - with which ruling, although it unquestionably i£ im accordance with custom, Captain Glubb does not agree. He urged however that it should be applied to these six sheep. On inquiry it turned out that the man of the 'Uraibd^r with whom they were found had only Just bought them from another man. The latter was questioned at the time, and proved to the satis faction of everyone, including Captain Glubb's man, that four out of the six animals had belonged to, and been bre^ by, Kuwait Arabs, and that only two were alleged to have been bought from the Ikhwan. Captain Glubb's ma n afterwards acknow ledg ed t o me personall y that this was the case. The two which had been bought from the Ikhwan and had belonged to the Bani M^lilc were sold by the Shaikh's orders and their value va^Xe sent to their original owners. I quote the above cases, not in any carping spirit at Captain Glubb's work, and indeed I admire his ability and like him personally very much, but merely to show that he has a distinct bias, and that, able as he undoubtedly is, he is very far from being infallible. You will undoubtedly have noticed yourself how very inaccurate he is regarding the history of Kuwait at the beginning of his note No.75^ dated the 12/l5th March 19^9. It was of course in the late Shaikh Salim's days that the tribes were lost to Kuwait,the 'Awizim, the old Kuwait tribe par excellence , being seduced from his allegiance by Ibn Sa'ud in retaliation for his action over the 'Ajman. It was indeed ineviatble that, with the Ikhwdn 'revival', tribes should prefer to be on their side rather than against them, and should transfer their allegiance to Ibn Sa'ud accordingly. When Shaikh Ahmad first became Ruler of Kuwait, he had, as now, no tribes other thathe 'UraiM^r, ^ In this connection it misht not be out of place to point out that the 'Uraitxiar are not a tribe, ae one would laafeine froia paragraph 77 of Intelligence Report Ho.6 dated the 13th March 1929, issued by the Secretariat of Hie Excellency the High Comalssioner for 'Iraq, but are, as their name iaplies the 'Household Arabs' of Kuwait. They are also sometimes called Fidawfyah, and are usually spoken of by the Shaikh himself as 'our servants'. Actually they belong to yarious tribes: Rashaidah, 'AJman, Mutair, etc., all of which however are of the Najd type. To revert to Captain Glubb's notes: it is per fectly true, of course, that the Mutair are allowed to buy supplies in Kuwait, and I absolutely agree with Captain Glubb that an agreement has undoubtedly been arrived at by which the Kuwait 'Uraibdar are to be left in peace in return for this privilege. The Shaikh naturally never told me when he made this agreement, and has no doubt all aloag been nervous that we might stem in and force him to close Kuwait to the Mutair - which from his point of view would mean plunging his country into a state of insecurity simi lar to that of last year, and denying a source of trade to his subjects. He has however always said that Kuwait is open to all who like to come to trade there. This is cer tainly as far as he has gone, and to say that this agree ment has ripened a regular alliance and that the Shaikh helps the rebellious Ikhwan in every way possible, i», in my opinion, merely absurd. With regard to Ibn Hithlain's raid on 21st Janu ary, I can show^ that he definitely tried to frustrate it in so far as he could without embroiling himself with t he_, Ikhwan , as, as soon as he received information about it, in addition to informing me (which he could hardly help doing) he sent a private telegram to Zubair for a taxi to be sent out to warn as many shepherds as possible, and it was this taxi coming back which the late Mr. Bilkert and his party met shortly before they were fired on. I agreeI' ] m\ n of oourse that he probably could, and if so certain should, have taken active steps against the raiders as the raid was in his territory. That he did not nay, I think, safely be attributed to weakness and his dread of getting embroiled in the quarrel again. With regard to Ibn Shuqair's raid on the Banl Malik, the incident in which Ibn Shuqair is alleged to have sent a messenger to the Shaikh, warning him to move the 'Uraibdar away from the shepherd!, is probably the same in origin as that reported in my telegram No.85 dated the 2^rd February, in which I reported that M A few familiei of Kuwait and 'Iraq tribes camped at Umm Ruus were warned by a man of the 'AJman late last night that a small raiding party under Ibn Shuqair, Fuqm and Ibn Lami was about to attack them. He advised them to move at once whi«h they did I and came into Jahrah this morning, Saturday. The Shaikh has sent a warning by car to the tribes south-east of Jahrah', The warning may have been intended for the 'Uraibdar alone, but I think there is no doubt that the Shaikh passed it on to all alike, so he can hardly be blamed if it was. On the 28th February I received a telegram from His Excellency the High Commissioner to the effect that it was reported that fifty tents of the Bani Malik who had been camped with the 'Uraibdar had received warning of a raid and fled to Kuwait town, but had been driven away by the Shaikh and were camped between Jahrah and Kuwait, and asking me to warn them to fall back on the main concentra tion of 'Iraq tribes at Umm al-Madafi'ah, I saw the Shaikh at once, and he told me that he had already advised them to join the other 'Iraq tribes where they would be safer, as there vras not room for them as well as the 'Uraibdar to take re£u{_,e within the walls of Jahrah in case of need, lie said ho was very glad to hear that the High Oommissioner wanted them to go, as their flocks made an attractive 'bait** for raiders and he did not like having them there when he could not adequately protect them. At my request he said he&gt;3! (6) would convey the High Gomnilssioner' s vrarning to then. what The above is no doubt the origin ofy3haikh 'Abdullah al- Jabir (who incidentally is the Shaikh's second cousin,not his brother) is- alleged to have said, and also of the story about the Shaikh hiving said that Governaent had told hiia to evict the shepherds and not protect then - both in garbled form. On the 1st March a deputation of four of the 3ani Malik cane to see me and said that the Shaikh had sent word to then that he could no longer be responsible for their safety, that a telegram had come from the 'Iraq Government that they were to Join the other 'Iraq tribes, and that they were not to stop there any longer* I told them that the telegram was one which I had received from H.S. the High Commissioner, who wanted them to go where they would be safe. They said they quite realized that» they would be perfectly safe if they once got there, but that there were so many spies about that they dare not risk the journey, and asked me to request the High Com missioner that an escort might be provided for them. I accordingly telegraphed to H»]£» the High CJommissioner conveying their request in my telegram No.112 of 1st March, at the same time telling the Shaikh that I was doing so, and asking him to let them remain here and make the best arrangements he could for their safety pending a reply• This was on the 1st March, and the blow fell on the morning of the ^rd, before any reply had been re ceived. With regard to the actual happenings on the morning of the 3rd March. The first I Jcnew that anything was happening was to hear the firing when I was out for a walk In the early morning. I then saw a horseman gallop in the direction of the Shaikh's palace, and heard that the 3ani Malik were being raided. I hurried back to the Political Agency, where I met the Shaikh Just arriving to tell me the news in a state of great flurry &amp; distressShortly after despatchins ray first telesraa I O ot into a car, and drove out to the wall to see if I could learn a-nything further of what was happening, and from what I saw then I find it rather difficult to oelieve all the stories about the shepherds being beaten back: with the flats of swords. The gates were shut, of coftrss, as one would expect then to be under the circurastances, but I actually saw one party of two or three men allowea to pass out - though by that tine the fighting was over in the vicinity of the town, I suggested to the Shailch at the tine that I thought he might send out a force in cars to pursue the raiders and try and recover some of the plunder as he had done to Riqa'i in January 19^&gt; t&gt;u ' t he said that he could not possibly risk it, as the raiders were much too strong for any force he could send out. As I said in rny telegram No, 160 dated the 14th March, I think it quite possible that his desire to prevent his people from becoming involved in the quarrel may have influenced the Shaikh in coming to this decision, and I consider that if this be so he was very much to blame. I most emphatically do not believe, however, that the Shaikh was implicated in any other way. -ven if one or two of the 'Uraibdar actually took part in the raid it would prove nothing worse against him than that he is not a very strong ruler, and it is I fear a fact that he is not. When one considers who and what the 'Uraibd^r are, and thinks how raiding appeals to all Bedouin, it would not be very extraordinary if one or tw did join in, but if they did, I am sure was without his knowledge or approval. The accusation brought against the 'UraibdalJ of retaining large numbers of animals belonging to the Ban! Malik have been disproved, as, although they have been given every facility to see for themselves, only sixteen sheep, twelve lambs and seven donkeys have been1 found, which I think everyone must acknowledge to be a negligible number under the circumetances• Moreover eleven of these animals which were plundered from the 3ani Malik in the raid of 21 sl January and two others which they lost in the raid of 3rd March are reported to have come into the possessioii of the 'Uraibdar by purchase I can say definitely that the allegations made by the Bani M ^lik refugees that 'no one in Kuwait would so much as give them a meal' are deliberately untrue. I have already given it as my opinion in my Kuwait News No. 5 of I929 that the Kuwait people were very kind to the refugees, and not only were they given food and clothing, but a subscription was got up for them as well. It must be remembered however that people like these Bani Malik who have lost their all are naturally dissatisfied with the world in general and distrustful of everyone in the place where they have suffered their loss. I think this, and the natural suspicion of Sh^ ' ah shepherd tribes of 'Iraq at a time like the present of everything Najdi, or resembling the Najdi (like the 'Uraibdar of Kuwait) are responsible for most of the accusations against the Shaikh, 'Uraibdar and people of Kuwait which have been made to Captain Glubb, and I would repeat what I said in tij telegram No. 160 dated the 14th March I929, that anti- Kuwait rumours may even have been suggested to these tribesmen by the politically minded as propaganda. To sum up: the Shaikh's policy has undoubtedly been to keep out of the quarrel at all costs as long as possible. He probably has obtained a guarantee from the neighbouring Ikhwan leaders that they will not raid his tribesmen in return for the privilege of buying supplies in Kuwait. He may even have allowed this desire to keep out of the quarrel to influence him in deciding that raiders in his territory were too strong to attack, and, if so, he was certainly to blame for this. I do not think however that one can justly accuse him of anything worse l(9) than this. As regards the aerite of his polioy: there !» nothing gallant or noble about it, it is true; but it has opened up a certain araount of trade for his people, and it has saved his tribesmen froa being raided, and all his subjects froa the fear of attack to which they were exposed last year. Consequently, I think we can say that in the interests of his own subjects it is probably the best policy which he could have followed. Proa the British point of view, his policy is certainly soaewhat annoying in so far as our interests in 'Iraq are concerned* On the other hand it saves us the inconvenience and expense of keeping one or aore of X His Majesty's Ships here, as we had to do for so long last year, and as we would alaost certainly have to do again if the Shaikh were again to incur the hostility of the Ikhwan. The Shaikh would, I know, be the first to own, as is indeed patent to everyone, that Kuwait owes its independence to us alone, and consequently I think we have every right dictate what policy the Shaikh should follow in a aatter of this sort, and to force hia to abandon any policy which we consider opposed to our interests. I have already expressed ay opinion, in ay tele graa No. 210 of 24th March 19^9, as to what action we should take in the evexit of Ibn Sa'ud defeating the tribes which are now flouting his authority, and the latter wish ing to take refuge in Kuwait, and you have endorsed that opinion. It only reaains, therefore, to consider whether it is, or is not, to our interests as a whole to coapel the Shaikh to abandon his present policy now, and to close Kuwait forthwith to the Mutair and other Ikhwan tribes who are now defying Ibn Sa'ud's authority. Now that the 'Iraq tribes are leaving Kuwait territory again it is really only this question of the blockade which concerns(10) our interests in 'Iraq at all. In this connection I would point out that the Special Service Officer, Kuwait, said in his aessage No. HK/85 dated the 28th March 19^9 that an agent whom he considers very knowledgeable had sugges ted that Ibn Sa'ud was atterapting to weaken resistance by waiting until the rebels' supplies are exhausted, when he hopes they will either surrender or attack hia. This aau had stated that caravans wfeich visit Kuwait are totally inadequate to replenish rebel supplies, and that all other desert ports are closed to then. This tallies entirely with nsy opinion, which is that this question of lausabalah with Kuwait - although certainly an important one - is hardly as important as Captain Glubb leads one to suppose. On the whole I am inclined to think that the advantages which we would gain in 'Iraq by forcing Kuwait to close its doors to the Ikhw^n would be more than outweighed by the disadvantages of having to protect Kuwait - as we would almost certainly have to do. This is, however, of course a matter of opinion. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant.

The position of the Shaikh of Kuwait, stand ing as he does unsupported between two strong contending parties^ The Political Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, BAGHDAD.parties, both of whom freely use his territories, is one of extreme difficulty, as he can afford to offend neither. The * Iraq tribes he has readily permitted to graze in his country and, in default of his own ability to protect them, has permitted outside pro tective arrangements to be made for them, and if these tribes had not entered his country, the present situation would apparently not have arisen. The Shaikh is not strong enough without outside support to take sides in the quarrel and his policy, though admittedly not a strong one, has been that which is inevitable in the case of a weaker power placed between two strong contending powers and forced by lack of outside support to attempt to maintain neutrality. The position of the Shaikh would be radical ly altered in the event of Ibn Sa'ud^ definitely breaking with and attacking his subject tribes, and the situation in that case has been dealt with inumy telegram of the 26th March, Ho. 211/5. Until that situation arises the state of af fairB does not seem to be such as to warrant our forcing the Shaikh of Kuwait to take sides in the quarrel, with the necessary ®or»llary of sending troops and ships far his immediate protection and the added probability of creating a position in the future which would necessitate our maintaining in definitely protective commitments in the Kuwait States A copy of this letter is being sent to the Gov eminent of India and to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Foreign Office to Mr. Jakins (Jeddah). (No. 71.) Sir, Foreign Office, April 11, 1929. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to inform you that the question of the channels to be used for communications between His Majesty's Government, or between the High Commissioners for Iraq, Palestine apd Transiordan, and King Ibn Saud has recently been under consideration. i • T' t V , V ^ , 2. You will recollect that in the course of the renewed negotiations with Sir G. Clayton in August 1923 (see paragraph 22^of Sir G. Clayton's despatch of the 3rd September to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, of which a copy was sent to you in Foreign Office Eastern print (Arabia), September 7, 1928, Section 1), the King requested that as far as possible all messages and communications from Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan should in future be sent through His Majesty's agency at Jeddah, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. In view of this request, the system hitherto in force, which has not proved entirely satisfactory, has been reviewed; and you should in future be guided by the instructions contained in the enclosed memorandum, which lays down the system which will be adopted until further notice. UNTIL August 1928 communications intended for Ibn Saud were sent through His Majesty's agent and consul at Jeddah when Ibn Saud was in the Hejaz, or through the Resident in the Persian Gulf (at Bushire) when Ibn Saud was in Nejd. 2. In August 1928 Ibn Saud requested that this arrangement should no longer be followed, but that in future all communications should be addressed to him through His Majesty's agent and consul, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. It may therefore now be laid down as a general rule that all communications for Ibn Saud shall pass through His Majesty's agency at Jeddah. 3. The High Commissioners at Bagdad and Jerusalem are authorised to correspond direct with Ibn Saud on matters of detail arising out of the Bahra and Hadda agreementR, and such communications will ordinarily be sent through His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, who will act merely as a channel of communication. In cases of extreme urgency, however, it will still be open to the High Commissioners to communicate with Ibn Saud through the quickest available channel, while sending a repetition or copy to His Majesty's agent and consul at Jeddah. Communications intended for Ibn Saud will ordinarily be addressed to His Majesty's agent at Jeddah direct by the High Commissioners concerned, but copies in the case of despatches, and repetitions in the case of telegrams, should in every case be sent to the Colonial Office. 4. As a general rule, such communications, whether sent by telegram or despatch, will be transmitted textually by His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, and they should be drafted on that understanding. His Majesty's agent will, however, have discretion, more particularly in the case of telegrams, to introduce any minor modifications of style or wording which, in the light of his local knowledge, he may consider desirable. It will further be open to His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, in any case where he considers that the proposed communication raises issues of political importance, to refer to the Foreign Office for instruction. Information received from the Iraqi and Transjordan Governments respecting raids on their tribes by Nejdian tribesmen, or replies from those Governments to complaints by the Hejazi Government respecting raids on Hejazi or Nejdian tribesmen, should, subject to the proviso indicated above, be communicated by His Majesty's agent to the Hejazi Government, without awaiting the receipt of instructions from London. I am, &amp;c, MONTEAGLE. Enclosure in No. 1. Communications with Ibn Saud. [763 1—1]5. Communications for Ibn Saud, or regarding Nejdian or Hejazi affairs, from Iraq, Transjordan or Palestine on all other questions should be addressed to the Colonial Office, but repeated, or copied, to Jeddah in every case. In such cases His Majesty's agent at Jeddah will not take official action on the communication until specifically authorised to do so by the Foreign Office. He may, however, if the matter to be dealt with is in any way urgent, take such informal action with the competent Hejazi authorities as he may think desirable. 6. Similarly, His Majesty's agent at Jeddah may address the High Commissioners for Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine direct on points of fact, on matters of routine, or in reply to enquiries, sending a repetition, or copy, in each case to the Foreign Office; while on all other questions he will address the Foreign Office direct, sending a repetition or copy to Bagdad or Jerusalem, when either is concerned, and reporting in each case in the body of the telegram or despatch that he has done so.

T HAVE the honour to forward an extract* from the ' Um el Qura ' on the punitive action taken by Ibn Saud against Faisal-ed-Doweish and Ibn Humaid-bin- Bujad. 2. The report claims that for two years there had been no personal contact between the King and the unruly chiefs of the Mutair and Ataibah tribes who, in the erection of the Iraq desert posts, had been provided with an excuse for raiding and with a number of adherents. 3. Stress is laid on His Majesty's efforts for peace even after Faisal and Bin Bujad had joined forces against him, and it was not until these chiefs had ignored a final injunction to return and subject themselves to the Sharia under threat of attack that Ibn Saud marched against them. 4. In conclusion the extract states that unrest, which is inevitably associated with change, arose in Nejd from a failure to appreciate the underlying religious principles of the new social order. The hope is expressed that as a result of the military action of Ibn Saud, Nejd may he freed from dissension and in the pursuit of religion and social progress serve to lead the Arab renascence.

This extract reports the flight of Faisal and Ibn Bujad, the former seriously wounded, after a decisive encounter on the 30th March. Ibn Saud subsequently consented to receive the submission of Faisal-ed-Doweish, after he had recovered from his wounds, on condition that he held no communication with his tribe, the Mutair. Ibn Bujad proceeded to Riyadh to surrender himself there, lest his life should be endangered by his presenting himself in the Royal camp. 3. The day after the battle Ibn Saud called together the uleraa and the chief tribesmen to the number of 2,000 that, warned by the recent incidents, they might arrive at an improved line of conduct. He therefore suggested that, so far as religion was concerned, they must rely on the rulings of the ulema and not on their individual judgment; that they should give him their complete allegiance ; that they should hold no meetings or assemblies without his permission; and, finally, that they should respect their fellow Moslems and their property. 4. The ulema approved of these proposals, which exactly met the wishes of the assembled chieftains. I have, &amp;c. H. G. JAKINS. * Not printed. r791 y—2] r i- HGPS...621...1081...5,000...18 9 22.

Political Secretary to H, E. The High Commissioner for 'Iraq, Enclosures :— extract from the Heport of the Southern Desert Administration i o- the month of Llarch, 1929, regarding relations with Kuwait. I - I 1 1Extract from the Report of the Southern Desert AdrainiBtration for the month of March, 1929 # xx xx RELATIONS WITH KUWAIT. Ever since the present v/riter has been connected with the Southern Desert of 1 Iraq, that is to say since 1923, he has regarded the Kuwait tribes as on an equal footing with those of 1 Iraq # . Never has he consciously given the latter any preferential treatment over the former, and, in fact, as honoured allies and friends, he has invariably, in such disputes as have arisen, accorded the benefit of the doubt to the natives of Kuwait. Apart from many smaller cases, the raid by Shibrum ibn Jabhan in 1926, and that by the Duwish on Kuwait and 'Iraq tribes near Jarishan in March, 1928, may be quoted. In the former case, not only were three squadrons of aircraft and one section of Armoured cars,' rallied to pursue the raiders, but police were flown by Vernon to A1 Zahra, at the request of the present writer, to collect Kuwait camels, abandoned by the raiders when bombed. Again, after the Duwish*s raid at Jarishan in March, 1928, the desert was full of scattered animals and flocks belonging to Araibdar. When Ibn Subah 1 s man, Saud Abu Dhafair, came to the present writer to recover any of the Kuwait stock with 'Iraq tribes, the latter told him that any animal which he recognised as belonging to the Kuwait tribes he could take, provided only that he, or another witness, first swear to its identity. During the winter of 1925-26, Araibdar crossed the Batin and camped in 'Iraq in the Dibdibba, The present writer took the opportunity to establish with them relations of personal hSsi - 2 - f ' peisonal friendship, which, he imagined, had remained inviolate until three weeks ago. Unfortunately, during the past winter, this situation has undergone a complete change. There can be no doubt whatever that Ibn Subah, continually raided for the past eight years, conceived the idea this year of allying himself with Lutair to secure immunity. As long as Akhwan raids into •Iraq and Kuwait were not disapproved by Ibn Sa^d, (er at least i as long as such as raided these countries continued to draw pay and presents from Ibn Sa'ud and to buy their supplies without interference in the Kasa, ilajd and 'Iraq) the Akhwan were in no need of Ibn Subah*s assistance, and any private advances made at that time by Ibn Subah to the luv/ish would probably have been rejected, uuring the past year, however, Ibn Sa* ud and 'Iraq both attempted to blockade the Akhwan, Their situation ' became critical, and the alliance of Ibn Subah became of vital J importance to them. Last autumn, therefore, the Duwish on behalf of the Akhwan, conclu ded an agreement with Ibn Subah, by which Araibdar should be immune from Akhwan raids, on a condition that the Akhwan were allowed to replenish their . ' supplies in Kuwait, This agreement led to a real rapprochement between Araibdar and the rebel Akhwan, It must be recollected that Araibdar is not a. trioe, but, so to speak, a nicknajne, given ^ to the conglomeration of bedouin tents which camp outside Kuwait, and acknowledge the supremacy of Ibn Subah. The bulk Ox this gioup are AJman, Mutair and Ataibah, with oddments from Anaizah, Dawasir Shammar and other tribes. In other worSs, probably eighty per cent of Araibdar were fellow tribesmen of the rebel Akhwan, Once, therefore, the Shaikh had given them a lead, it required a little to cement a secret agreement into an open alliance. There was no natural or traditional■M | traditional barrier separating the two groups, as is the case, for example, between the Akhwan and the 'Iraq Shepherds, Araibdar, therefore, began soon to cooperate actively with the Akhwan, in obtaining information, spying on the 'Iraq tribes and camps, and even accompanying them on raids, From the bedouin point of view, there is nothing very surprising in this. All bedouins are born mercenaries, and changes sides in war as readily as a. man changes his shirt. These activities, however, cannot possibly have been unknown to the Shaikh, and if there is any blame to be apportioned it must undoubtedly be laid at his door. In addition to the active assistance rendered by Kuwait to the Akhwan, assistance which enormously increased the difficulties of defence, Ibn Subah adopted a very trouble some attitude regarding 1 Iraq tribesmen. Many such who entered Kuwait were seized by the Shaikhs men and deprived of their riding camels or rifles, on the grounds that they were lost property of Araibdar, This was quite possibly the case, Araibdar have been so frequently raided in recent years, that their property, like that of the 'Iraq tribes, is now scattered far and wide over Arabia. In every case, however, the 'Iraq in possession of the camels taken, offered to prove through witnesses that he had bought the animals bona-fide. It is obvious that, had they stolen the animals from Kuwait, they would scarcely have ridden them back into that town. From time immemorial, the camels tribe have raided one another's flocks, and many bedouin camels live the most chequered careers, changing hands by raiding or purchase up and down the length and breadth of Arabia, If any man who recognised a camel as having been raided from him years ago, had the right to seize it from its present owner- 4 - jU fiS) owner without compensation all trading in camels would cease, Mo merchant would risk his capital in buying camels, were they likely to be seized from him without compensation by any bedouin who claimed them as once having been his property. It is, therefore, however, a universal custom that camels taken in raids cannot be claimed by their original owner, should the man in whose possession they are found have oought them, Ibn Subah, however, is regardless of custom or right^ ^itioin the walls of his tov/n , when dealing with * Iraq subjects, A notable contrast was afforded by his treatment of the mutair caravans arriving in Kuwait, Mutair,of course, possess very large numbers of camels raided by them from Kuwait, iheie is no record, however, of a Mutairi being dragged from hie camel and the latter seized by the Shaikh, as was done in the case of 1 Iraqis, These, and several other similar incidents, were aggravating rather than serious, but they provoked great indignation amongst the 'Iraq tribes. Morally Ibn Subah may think himself quite justified in allying himself with the Akhwan. Neither Ibn ba'ud nor His Majesty's Government have ever made any real attempt to defend him, and he may well, in these circumstances, plead that he is justified in looking after himself. Such manoeuvres are a regular feature of Arabian politics, Ibn Subah has oeen no more dishonest than Ibn Sa'ud, who, from 1922 to 1926, took one fifth of the loot raided by the Akhwan from 'Iraq, while at the same time, professing to His Majesty's Government the gravest displeasure at the Akhwan attacks and promising to punish them, X\or, for that matter, has he, in the popular mind, been any weaker than His Majesty's Government, who from 1922 to 1927, allowed aallowed hundreds of their subjects (or those under their protection) to be raided and slaughtered by a crowd of ragged bedouins. It is probable, however, that Ibn Subah was not only inspired by timidity in allying himself with Mutair, but that he also took a secret pleasure in making things difficult for Ibn Sa f ud, with whom he has a ImjacxXriiKg long-standing dispute over customs, and who has allowed the Akhwan to raid him for years without taking any action. However this may be, Ibn Subah has earned the contempt of all the tribes, both 15ajdi and 'Iraqi, by kow-towing so slavishly to those who for years have been slaying his men and looting his property. Particularly disgraceful was the raid on Bani Malik, from whom he had accepted khawa.(? SECRET . KG PS.. 621... 1081...5,000... 18 9 2t. vt j ^ ^ efvcc- H. C.

T.C.Extract irom Report of th© Southern Desert Administration for the month of March, 1929. v HAJD SITUATION AKD ACTIVITIES OF AKHWAN TRIBES . The combined offensive of Ibn Humaid, the Duwish, Ibn Hithlain amd Xbn Shqair have already been reported in this office monthly report for February. It has been explained how, on 19th February, Ibn Humaid, apprehensive of government defensive measures, raided ITaJd instead of 1 Iraq tribes, and how the Duwish, having reached Julaida with the avowed intention of attacking the Administrative Inspectors camp, turned back within six hours march of the latter, Ibn Humaid not only raided the Sinjara Shammar, Hajd subjects and themselves Akhwan, and the Dahamshah and Ruwallah, respectively 'Iraq and Syrian subjects, seduced by Ibn Sa^d and having paid taxes to him, but also a large number of Agail merchants, mostly townsmen of Buraidah, one of the most Wahhabi of the Najd towns. All the bedouins of Arabia live largely by the sale of camels to itinerant merchants, who drive their purchases across the desert for sale in Egypt or Syria. The immunity of merchants from molestation by bedouin raiders was therefore, doubtless, originally dictated by economic needs. In the old bedouin wars, both parties depended for their livelihood on the sale of camels to such merchants, and their free movement amongst the tribes, even while at war, was an economic necessity to all parties. That, however, which was undoubtedly originally a question of financial economy, soon became imperceptibly a point of honour, and to raid Agail merchants, under the old Arab dispensation, was an unheard of breach of the rules of war. Y/hen the fanatic revival of Wahhabism occurred, ten to fifteen years ago, this- 2 - this custom remained inviolate, not only because economic necessity dictated it, as before, but also because the town of Buraidah, the home of the great majority of camel dealers, was distinguished (coupled perhaps with Riyadh) as the most religious or fanatical of the Hajd towns. Ibn Hurnaid, however, not only looted the flocks of the Agail merchants at Nawadhir, but the merchants themselves were massacred, almost, it appears, to a man. Even the bloody and treacherous annals of Wahhabism could produce few parallels to such a crime. Reports from Najd indicate that, whether or not Ibn Sa'ud would in any case have taken action against Ibn Humaid, the massacre of the Agail merchants created such an outcry amongst tovmspeople of Najd, as almost to compel him to take action. While Ibn Sa^ad has long regarded with equanimity if not with approval, the disasters inflicted on the 'Iraq tribes by his subjects, he could scarcely, without endangering his throne, regard with indifference the massacre by Ibn Humaid of the merchants of Buraidah. Early in March therefore he proceeded to Buraidah, where he called upon the loyal tribes to rally, and raised a levy of the townspeople. The Duwish, meanwhile, after his abortive attempt to attack the Administrative Inspector, was camped with his forces at Umm Ashar, in the Batin between A1 Hafar and A1 Thimami. On receipt of news of Ibn Sa'ud's preparations, the Duwish sent an urgent message to Ibn Humaid, who wa-s camped at Lina dividing his loot, to join him at Umm Ashar. Ibn Humaid moved, in compliance, from Lina, and joined forces with the Duwish near Jarab, The pair moved slowly southwards, and were reported at the end of the month between Zilfi and Ain ibn Fuhaid in the Qasim, Meanwhile it appears that correspondence had been passing- 3 - I • passing between the two sides. Ibn Sa'ud offered to refer the dispute between himself and Ibn Humaid to the Shara* or religious law. It is still not clear whether the proposal was accepted or rejected. The Duwish, on the other hand, acting in a manner as intermediary between Ibn Sa'ud and Ibn Humaid, offered the return of the loot taken by Ibn Humaid from Kajd tribes, on condition that that looted from 'Iraq tribes might be retained. It is said that these terms were refused by Ibn Sa'ud, In brief, in spite of frequent reports during the month that a clash between the two armies was imminent, no report of a battle had been received by the end of the month. It seems probable that the rebel tribes, though undoubtedly outnumbered by Ibn Sa'ud's force, are sufficiently strong to inflict very heavy losses if attacked by him. ■BEDOUIN LIUTAIH. While these events were in progress between Ibn Sa'ud Ibn Humaid, and the Duwish, the bedouin portion of Mutair were camped at the commencement of March along the southern boundary of Kuwait, from Ash Shaqq, to Umm Amarah west. They had moved to this area partly to be near Kuwait town, with a view to replenishing their supplies. Meanwhile Ibn Shqair, A1 S Fugnam and Ibn Lami with their v/ar banners, were at Aba al Hiran, just south of the Kuwait frontier. On 3/3/29, this force, some five hundred strong raided some thirty tents of Bani Malik shepherds beneath the walls Ox Kuwait, This incident has already been reported on. Many men ffom the Mutair camps on the Kuwait frontier joined the raid. On 8/3/29, two police cars on patrol' near Umm Amarah west were suddenly fired upon by a party of about forty horsemen. The police cars turned the eastern flank of the horsemenhorsemen and continued to travel south, with the object of ascertaining whether the party was advanced guard of a raiding party. They came in sight of grazing camels and sheep, however, and, satisfied that they were dealing with a camp not a raiding party, endeavoured to retire to the north. The horsemen, however, had meanwhile cut off their retreat. The police fired a few shots at the horsemen with their rifles, in the hope of causing them to retire, having been instructed that their role was to scout and not to provoke a battle. The rifle shots rather encouraged than intimidated the horsemen, probably creating in them the impression that the cars had not got machine guns. The horsemen, who could gallop considerably faster than the cars could travel (they were two new Ford lorries), pressed boldly on the cars firing rapidly from the saddle, Meanwhile camel and footmen were advancing from the camp to join in the battle. The N,C,0, in command thereupon hoisted the 'open fire' signal, and the police opened upon the enemy with two Lewis guns. Three men and one horse were killed. The horsemen immediately scattered precipitately, and the cars were able to make good their retreat. The incident produced a deep moral effect. The camp, which proved to be that of Mutlaq ibn Jarbu*, (Diyahin section) fled fcaxfcs incontinently, abandoning a quantity of household property in their flight. The majority of the other camps in the vicinity retired towards Lusafa, A number of Mutair camps, however, remained in the vicinity of Ash Shaqq, On 17-3-29, two taxis employed on scouting duty near Ash Shaqq, encountered a Mutair caravan proceeding to Kuwait, The Mutairis opened a heavy fire on the cars, which was returned by the latter, which contained four riflemen. The cars made goodI ■ J a H ' ll ill ; ^ good their escape, the caravan having no horsemen. On 18-3-29, a more dangerous incident occurred. Two scout taxis came in sight of grazing camels west of Subaihiya, At this moment, the driver of one of the cars proclaimed that his petrol was finished, got out of the car, opened a fresh tin and prepared to pour it into the tank. While the cars were halted, a number of men suddenly advanced from amongst the camels and opened fire. It was some minutes before the driver could screw down the stopper of the tank, start up his engine, and get in. During this period, the situation of the cars was critical. Eventually the cars were able to get on the move and effect their retreat, no horsemen having appeared on the scene. It appears that the men were from a mixed camp of Rashaida and Mutair. The horses were probably out grazing and could not be caught in time to join in the action. In the course of their retirement, the cars ran into another flock of camels close by, which they had not seen in their advance. The men with these also opened fire. Seeing them to be few in number, the care returned the fire, whereupon the men fled, and the cars drove off some twenty camels. The occupants of the cars consisted of Dhafir tribesmen, under the command of one constable of the desert police. The latter had received strict orders not to loot, and, as a result, was dismissed from the police next day. The Administrative Inspector was at the time greatly displeased at thd bringing in of these twenty camels. Actually, however, the incid-ent probably did more good than harm. After it, the camps in the Ash Shaqq area also disappeared, and Mutair caravans to Kuwait made a vide detour coming up between Subaijiiya and the sea coast.The presence of these camps within some forty miles of that of the Administrative Inspector had for the period of a month, rendered scout patrols almost useless. It would have been easy for a raiding party to have lain up unperceived in these camps by day, and to have advanced after dark, covered the intervening distance at night, and attacked the 'Iraq tribes at dawn. On or about 20/3/29, a sudden orgy of raid and counter raid broke between the Mutair bedouins and their neighbours, Mutair raided Sebei, and Sebei Mutair, Mutair raided the Ajman, capturing two flocks of camels belonging to Ibn Jiluwi. Mutair also raided Harb but were repulsed, A few days after this outburst, however, an urgent messenger from the Duwish reached the Mutair bedouins, calling upon them to send their fighting men immediately to his support. It is stated that his first intention was to raid Muhsin al Firm (Harb) who had intercepted some men returning from Ibn Humaid 1 s raid and relieved them of their loot. Muhsin al Firm, however, received wa-rning and collected all his followers, the Bani Ali division of Harb, at Ajibba, Either through reluctance to risk a bloody encounter now that Harb were prepared, or because Ibn Sa'ud's forces were too close to make it advisable for the Duwish to leave on a separate expedition, the idea of raiding Harb was apparently abandoned, and the Duwish, with his Mutair reinforcements, remained with Ibn Humaid, IBII SHQAIR. AL FUGHAI1. IBK LAMI AxID IBIJ HITHLAII^ As already reported, Ibn Shqair, Al Fugham and Ibn Lami were camped at Aba al Hiran at the commencement of the month, and on 3-3-29, raided Bani Malik outside the walls of Kuwait, After this success, they retired to their homes in Jariya,\ Jariya, and took no further action during the month. When the Duwish called upon the Mutair bedouins to join him v/ith their fighting men, he ordered the three above mentioned Shaikhs v/ith Ibn Hithlain to remain in the Jariya area, prepared to repulse any advance undertaken by Ibn Jiluwi, In spite, however, of continual reports of the collection of large forces by Ibn Oiluwi, no action was taken by him during the month. Meanwhile Ibn Hithlain was camped with a force of about 150 men at Khabari Wahdhha, some ninety miles south of Jahra-h. The continued presence of this force within 24 hours march of the * Iraq tribes, caused great anxiety throughout t the month. Although the nucleus of hie force was only one hundred and fifty men, it would probably have been joined by anything up to two hundred more from the neighbouring bedouin camps, within a few hours, had he set out to raid. He need not have crossed the Eajd-Kuwait frontier until after dark, and could still have attacked the * Iraq tribes at dawn next morning, and thus car patrols were not a practical protection. Early in the month, a party of camel scouts from this raid actually reconnoitred the camp of No,6 Armoured Car Company near Hissu Adh Dhabbi, The Administrative Inspector on 7-3-29, encountered this party of twelve camelmen about noon, some ten miles south of Jal al Liyah, The Administrative j Inspector was in a single touring car, and was on his way to visit No, 6 Armoured Cars Company, Seeing a force of camelmen with no tribes in the vicinity, he halted some three hundred -f yards away, and sent an Arab on foot to cross question the party. They replied that they were Araibdar, and the Arab sent to them recognised one of them as such. They stated that they were from a camp of the Tawatha section of Araibdar, south\i rs. (&amp;UX south oi Qara al Muru, Subsequent enquiries proved that there was no such camp. It was subsequently ascertained that this party was actually Ibn Kithlain's scouts. Had not one of their party been recognised as belonging to Araibdar, the Administrative Inspector could easily have reached Uo.6 A.C.C. who were only twelve miles away, and have brought them up to attack the gc oats. On this and several other occasions during the month, however, the active cooperation of Araibdar with the enemy made defensive measures very difficult, A large part of the Araibdar are of the Ajman tribe, of v7hich Ibn Hithlain is the Shaikh, and they have undoubtedly been assisting the Akhwan for the past three months. The scout party, on returning home, reported that the oajap consisted ol only three armoured cars and one tent. They may have thought that they had seen the Administrative Inspectors camp. It is reported that Dhaidan Ibn Hithlain thereupon sent urgent messages to Mutair, asking for three hundred picked men to supplement his force, with the object of rushing the camp at night and killing the Administrative Inspector, an ambition long cherished by many of the Akhwan. At the last moment, however, the enterprise was abandoned or postponed either through fear of an advance by Ibn Jiluwi, or because the outoreak of inter-raiding between the Akhwan tribes kept Mutair occupied elsewhere. Towards the end of the month, Ibn Hithlain sent messengers to the Awazim, urging them to join him. The Awazim had, up to this time, been loyal to Ibn Jilawi, and are moreover bitter enemies of Braih Mutair. Reports, however, indicatedindicated that the Awazim were, at the time, very apprehensive of attack. It is not clear as yet, whether they accepted Ibn Hithlain*s invitation or not, but they may possibly have done so out of fear, especially in view of the apparent inactivity of Ibn Jiluwi, THE STOin: DE^-RT A^TD WAD I AIT &gt; With the departure of Ibn Humaid from Lina for Jarab early in the month, no Akhwan forces remained in the Stony Desert area. Meanwhile, however, two minor Anaizan ciiiefs had commenced to mimic the activities of the success.!.ul reoe^. leaders, Earhan ibn Mashshur ibn Shaalan is, of course, a Syrian subject and a o^ior member of the Shaikhly family of Ruwallah, Two years ago, as the result of a family dispute with Nuri ibn Shaalan, he left Syria a-nd visited Ibn Sa ! ud, who made him handsome presents, and gave him a village and cultivation near Ha-il, at Jhaibah, iuncoura fe ed by the impunity with which Mutair and Ataibah have, for two years, gorged themselves with loot irom ooth Hajd and ' Iraq tribes, while Ibn Sa»ud sits passive, Farhan ibn Mashshur on 28-2-29, raided thirty tents of the Suwailmat Dahamshah in the Wadi A^ar. The raid was one of massacre, in true Akhwan style, thirteen men of the Dahamshah being killed. All the property and flocks of the camp vveie looted, Th^ Suwailmat had not paid taxes to Ion Sa^a. Murdhi al Rufi€i is an » Iraq subject, and one of the principal Shaikhs of the Amarat. Two years ago, as the result of a dispute with Ibn Hadhdhal he left 1 Iraq and crossed- 10 - (34U crossed to Najd (subsequent to the Bahra treaty). He was warmly welcomed 'by Ibn Sa^ud, given money and gifts, and settled in a village with cultivation at Bilaziya, in the province of Hail. This man, on 14-3-29, carried out a blood thirsty raid on a large camp of Sulubba, south of Akhwadhah, The number of men massacred has been variously reported at betv/een forty and eighty.

Three 1 Iraq merchants, one a native of Kajaf, and two of Kubaisah, were killed in the Sulubba camp, uovmwts 0? the » iraq tribes . EASTERN AREA . On the first of March, the main concentration of 'Iraq tribes, accompanied by the Administrative Inspector, were camped at Umm al Madafa, in Jiuwait territory. Of those present, the Zayyad and Dhafir camped round the Administrative Inspectors camp, and moved everywhere with him. These two are the hardiest of the desert tribes of this area. Behind them, swarmed a heterogeneous mass of Jasham, Rufai, Sa'adah, Sadun, and odds, and ends, some of whom had never before camped east of the Euphrates, The Budur remained throughout the month in the Rukbi-Chilawa-Jarishan area, behind the post of the 'Iraq Army Motor Machine kun Company at Adhaibah # The Juwarin spent the first three weeks of the month near Raudhatain, with Bani Malik (twice raided this year) behind them. The Administrative Inspector, accompanied by the Zayyad and Dhafir, with the hoi polloi moving parallel to and north1 north of him, moved camp during March as follows:- 1/3/29, From Ruhail to Umm al Madafa. Umm al Madafa to Shiq^at al Jalib, Shiqqat al Jalib to Adhairat al Handh. 6/3/29. 11/3/29. 19/3/29. 23/3/29. Adairat al Handh to five miles south of O^ara al LIuru, Qara al Muru to a point five miles 1J.W. of Jahrah, FIGHTIIIG SPIRIT 0? -HI] 1 IRAQ. TRI33S. A total of nearly two hundred rifles was distributed to the tribes during the month, chiefly to the Zayyad and Dhafir, The same policy as was outlined in the month report for February was continued. These two tribes remained constantly concentrated round the Administrative Inspectors camp, and frequent ardhas and hausas were held to keep up the offensive (or rather defensive) spirit. While it is doubtful whether these tribes would really have fought in the event of a heavy Akhwan attack, yet these manoeuvres undoubtedly produced a considerable deterrent moral eliect on the enemy, DBSERT FORCES . Actions with the Enemy , Ibn s raid . Definite information has now been received of the manner of the death of constables Radhi ao Salim and Sulman Al Lafi, of the Southern Desert Camel Corps, who were killed in Ibn Humaid's raid near Jumaimah, on 19/2/29. The two constables had been sent to warn the shepherds to retire. They spent the night with the Zayyad and left their camp at dawn next morning. An hour after thqrleft them, the Zayyad were raided. A man of the tribe has now reported to Sulman. He states that he fled on foot when the raid began, and concealed himself in a rooky ledge some miles notth ■4 i- 12 - ' north of the site of the camp. i^rom his place of concealment, he saw the two camel constables also retiring northwards. When about a mile from him, they were overtaken by a force of thirty horsemen. The two constables dismounted, lay down on a small hillock and opened fire. The informant estimates that they maintained the unequal contest for a period which estimated as two hours, keeping up a steady fire at all who approached, while they were gradually surrounded by an v v. n -r enemy Eventually the fire of the increasing numbei Ox the ener. v , . nnd +he informant states that he saw one two constables ceased, and the Akhwan then rushed tne nixj. Of them stand up and wave. The Aknwa and he saw no more. Another man, a Shammari, who visited the site of the raid some days later in the hopes of picking up stray animals or property on the battle field, has also reported to the police. He alleges that he found the bodies of the two policemen on a small hill. Beside each corpse was a pile of about two hundred empty cartridge cases. The corpses were riddled with dagger wounds and bullet wounds fired at very short range, A third man of the Eajd Shairanar reports that he spent a night with Ibn Humaid's force after the raid. He alleges that he heard the raiders discussing the fight put up b^ two long camelmen. saying that these two kafirs had inflicted m ore loss on the Muslimin than all the tribes raided put r together. It appears that the two constables must have fought on until all their ammunition was exhausted, when they were rushed and butchered in cold blood. It is hoped that the j 'Iraq Government will award a generous gratuity to the dependents of the two men who died so gallantly m action. ^lie a .To Wiation Baghdad reptd Glubb Special Basrah From Howeo Kuwait.

Foreign Office, April 11, 1929. 1 AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to inform you that the question of the channels to be used for communications between His Majesty's ^r^ment, ru between the High Commissioners for Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, and King Ibn Saud has recently been under consideration. -• will lecollect that in the course of the renewed negotiations with Sir Gr. Clayton in August 192S (see paragraph 22 of Sir G. Clayton's despatch of t le 3rd Septembei to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, of which a copy was sent to you in Foreign Office Eastern print (Arabia), September 7, 1928, Section 1), the .King lequested that as far as possible all messages and communications from Iraq, a estine and liansjouian should in future be sent through His Majesty's agency at Jeddah even during his periods of residence in Nejd. In view of this request, the system hitherto in force, which has not proved entirely satisfactory, has been reviewed; and you should in future be guided by the instructions contained in the enclosed memorandum, which lays down the system which will be adopted until further notice. 1 am, &amp;c. MONTEAGLE. . ? is the Ppoperty of Hi» Britannic Majesty's Government. | . ^ ( % .- } A I Enclosure in No. 1. Communications with Ibn Saud. jj . Jl ^ ^ ll S us t 1028^-communications intended for Ibn Saud were sent through H is Majesty s agent and ^Onsul at 'leddah when Ibn Saud was in the Hejaz, or through the Resident in the Persian Gulf (at Bushire) when Ibn Saud was in Nejd. 2 In August 1928 Ibn Saud requested that this arrangement should no longer be followed, but that in future all communications should be addressed to him through His Majesty s agent and consul, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. It may theiefore now be laid down as a general rule that all communications for Ibn Saud snail pass through His Majesty's agency at Jeddah. 3. 1 he High Commissioners at Bagdad and Jerusalem are authorised to correspond direct with Ibn Saud on matters of detail arising out of the Bahra and Hadda agreements, and such communications will ordinarily be sent through His Majesty s agent at Jeddah, who will act merely as a channel of communication In cases of extreme urgency, however, it will still be open to the High Commissioners to communicate with Ibn Saud through the quickest available channel, while sending - a i-epeuuou or copy to His Majesty's agent and consul at Jeddah. Communications intended for Ibn Saud will ordinarily be addressed to His Majesty's agent at Jeddah direct by the High Commissioners concerned, but copies in the case of despatches and repetitions in the case of telegrams, should in every case be sent to the Colonial Office 4. As a general rule, such communications, whether sent by telegram or despatch will be transmitted textually by His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, and they should be drafted on that understanding. His Majesty's agent will, however, have discretion moie particularly in the case of telegrams, to introduce any minor modifications of styie or wording which, m the light of his local knowledge, he may consider desirable. It will further be open to His Majesty s agent at Jeddah, in any case where he considers that the proposed communication raises issues of political importance, to refer to the foreign Oflice for instruction. Information received from the Iraqi and Transiordan Governments respecting raids on their tribes by Xejdian tribesmen, or replies from those Governments to complaints by the Hejazi Government respecting raids on Heiazi or Nejd.an tribesmen, should subject to the proviso indicated above, be communicated by His Majesty s agent to the Hejazi Government, without awaiting the receipt of instructions from London. [763 1—1]2 5. Communications for Ibn Saud, or regarding Nejdian 01 Hejazi affairs, fioni Iraq, Transjordan or Palestine on all other questions should be addressed to the Colonial Office, but repeated, or copied, to Jeddah in every case, in such cases His Majesty's agent at Jeddah will not take official action on the communication until specifically authorised to do so by the Foreign Office. He may, however, if the matter to be dealt with is in any way urgent, take euch informal action with the competent Heiazi authorities as he may think desirable. . . 6. Similarly, His Majesty's agent at Jeddah may address the High Commissioners for Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine direct on points of fact, on matters of routine, or in reply to enquiries, sending a repetition, or copy, in each case to the toieign Office , while on all other questions he will address the Foreign Office direct sending a repetition or copy to Bagdad or Jerusalem, when either is concerned, and reporting in each case in the body of the telegram or despatch that he has done so. Foreign Office, April 1929.• ™ • I 61/14-YIII. Baghdad telegram No. 19-3, dated 21-i-29. Of the two alternatives proposed 'by High Commri, Baghdad, the first - the move into the neutral zone does not concern us. with regard to the second - the move into Kuwait territory - the only point which concerns us is the proposal that Iraq, police and army cars as well as British armoured cars should accoinpany the tribes. On Kuwait telegram No. 64, dated 13-2-29, ( which on this point gave not the Shaikh's opinion 'but Ool. More^ own views) P.R. has informed Baghdad and Colonies in his telegram No. 100/3, dated 16-2-29, that it would he preferable if Iraq, army cars entered Kuwait territory only in actual pursuit of raiders. So it does not appear that we have anything further to say at present. We may however inform Kuwait of High % Commissioner's proposal, repeating to P.R. for informat- -lon. Draft telegram submitted. post copy of the Baghdad telegram can be sent to P.R. by this mail. # Secy. 22/2/29 (i UPH 1** 2</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00022d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/584</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00022d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/584</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 61/14 VIII (D 55) Relations Between Nejd And Iraq'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1928/1929</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-02T12:04:50</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (389 folios)</extent><extent>The volume is arranged chronologically.
