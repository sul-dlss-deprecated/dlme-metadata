No. p, 588^38 ( Bahrein Unallotted Area. 1. I have had under considerations in consultation with the other Departments concerned, the correspondence resting ' 0 I'+ 'I with your Express Letter of 19th June, No.C/337, regarding the negotiations for an oil concession in the Bahrein unallotted area. The question has 'been discussed at an ^-f lo interdepartmental meeting, a note of which is enclosed for your information, at which advantage was taken of the presence of Mr. Belgrave in this country to obtain his views. In the light of this discussion and subject to the Sheikh's own views (on which it is now desired to sound him), we have come to the conclusion that, for the following reasons, the best course would be to advise the Sheikh to suspend negotiations and postpone a decision sine die . (i). It will be seen that in Mr. Belgrave's opinion the Sheikh himself would welcome a proposal to this effect, and that his family would raise no objection. The Sheikh is no doubt satisfied with the very large income which he obtains from his present royalties, and consequently has little motive on the pecuniary side for desiring to grant a further concession. On the other hand, he and his family appear to be deeply impressed by the implied threat of the Bahrein Petroleum Company that, if another concessionaire is introduced into his territories, they may for that reason slow/Is 2. slow down their production on their present concession. It seems in fact improbable that the Company,, in deciding on their production policy, would be influenced by other than ordinary commercial motives, especially in view of the large amount of money which they have already sunk in Bahrein and their presumable desire to keep and extend their markets. But in view of the large interests which are at stake from the Sheikh's point of view, it seems improbable that it would be possible to persuade him that the Company's threat can be discounted, however likely it may be that it is a bluff. Moreover, if for technical or commercial reasons the Bahrein Petroleum Company did find it necessary or advisable to reduce their production of Bahrein oil, and if the Sheikh had meanwhile, on the advice of H.M.G., given a concession to another Company, the Sheikh would no doubt connect the one event with the other, and might be inclined to impute the blame to the advice which we had given him. The Sheikh's main preoccupation at present is evidently to avoid any action which he fears might induce the Bahrein Petroleum Company to slow down production, while at the same time, he wishes so far as possible, to keep on good terras with both Companies and comply with the wishes of H.M.G. It seems not unlikely, therefore, that, as Mr. Belgrave is confident would be the case, he would welcome a proposal to leave the whole question dormant. (ii) Postponement would be acceptable to H. M. G-. We should have time to see the effect of developments in Hasa. • ; e are, moreover, committed to giving some assistance to Petroleum Concession Limited in the Persian ^ulf area, e.g., on the Trucial Coast, and the giving of a nev. and costly concession to their rivals in Bahrein might well increase the/the difficulties of their negotiations with the Trucial Sheikhs, furthermore, if the Bahrein Petroleum Company now obtained portions of unallotted area which Petroleum Concessions Limited desire, latter would have a grievance against us on the ground that, as they are aware, Sheikh had practically decided on a division of the area coinciding with their wishes, and that it was in the expectation of this that they refrained from sending a negotiator and agreed to our request not to send Holmes. (iii) Prom the point of view of the Companies it may perhaps he hoped that the Bahrein Petroleum Company would acquiesce in the proposed decision, since their main object seems to he to avoid the introduction of a rival Company. Petroleum Concessions Limited would probably be disappointed and aggrieved, but their grievance would be less acute than if the concession which they seek were given to their rivals. 2. I think it would be desirable, however, if the Sheikh is disposed to favour postponement, to allow Petroleum Concessions Limited an opportunity to express their views to me before final orders are passed. 3. At this stage, therefore, it seems desirable in the first instance to ascertain how the Sheikh would view a proposal to postpone a decision, and, if you see no objection, you should instruct Political Agent to sound him orally on this suggestion. This will mean waiting until the Sheikh returns to Bahrein from Kashmir and as there must therefore be some delay in any case, you may think it preferable to postpone any discussion with the Sheikh until after Belgrave's return from leave. The Political Agent might state that H.M.G. have now considered the whole matter most carefully. In view of the strongly worded remonstrance from the Bahrein Petroleum Company, they understand/understand His Hignncss's rGluctancG to csirry out a. plan which ye now learn would he so distasteful to a Company already established in Bahrein and working there so successfully. .We appreciate Sheikh's desire to avoid possibility of friction between the two Companies. As regards any risk that the Bahrein Petroleum Company might slow down production because a concession had been given to another Company^ we ourselves, for the reasons indicated above, do not think it likely that the Company's policy in regard to production would be influenced by such a consideration. We quite appreciate his anxiety, however, to avoid any such risk, in view of the great interests at stake. His Highness no doubt is satisfied Y /ith his present income from royalties, and, so long as this is not Jeopardised, we imagine that it is comparatively immaterial to him, from the pecuniary point of view, whether or not he grants a further concession. We also believe that he would desire so far as possible to avoid causing unnecssary disappointment to Petroleum Concessions Limited who, we fear, would by no means be satisfied with a division which gave them only the Hawar Islands. In all the circumstances, it seems to H.M.G. that the simplest and best course might be to inform the Companies that he has decided to suspend negotiations and postpone a decision sine die . This would relieve the Bahrein Petroleum Company of their fear of the introduction of a rival; and, though Petroleum Concessions Limited would be disappointed, their disappointment would not be so great as if a decision were taken contrary to their wishes? while His Highness and H.M.G. will have time to see how matters develop, in regard particularly to oil in Hasa. communication to the Companies in this sense would not, of course, preclude His Highness/II 'Y &gt; ♦ rs r Highness from re-opening the matter at the first favourable opportunity. 4. The Political Agent should ask the Sheikh what his own views are, and should explain that his present object is merely to consult with His Highness and that H.M.G. do not suggest that he should send a reply to the Companies' letters of 8th Juno until they have learnt his views on the above proposal when they will make a further communication to him. 0*** ,r(' 4 - The issue of the above has been duly authorised. ,) r bNote of a meeting held at the India Office on Thursday, 7th July, 1938, to discuss Oil Concessions in the Bahrein Unallotted Area. Mr. J.C, Walton (Chairman) Mr. R. T. Peel Mr. J. P. Gibson Mr. T.V. Brenan Mr. H. M. Eyres Maoor G.W.M. Grover ? P.M. Mr. P.H. Jones Mr. P.C. Starling Mr. Belgrave (Adviser to t was present during pa ) ) India Office Foreign Office N. Admiralty Petroleum Department e Sheikh of Bahrein) t of the proceedings. Mr. Walton opened the meeting 'by summarising the history of the negotiations up to the present. Some two years ago both P.C.L. and the B.P.C. had sought to obtain from the Sheikh of Bahrein a concession over the whole of the Unallotted Area. The Sheikh at the time contemplated a division of the Unallotted Area between the two Companies, but subsequently, in May 1937, decided to suspend the negotiations for a year. At the close of the period the Sheikh, in order to avoid a process of bargaining with the two Companies, decided to settle in advance, subject to the approval of H.M.G., a division of the area and the terms required therefor and to communicate his intentions to the Companies. It transpired that under the scheme of division which he had in mind the share of P.C.L. corresponded closely with the area which that Company themselves were proposing to ask for, since it conceded to them the outlying islands and shoals and to B.P.C. the remainder of the t¥^o main islands. While the Sheikh's proposals were being considered in London, Mr, Thornberg/v o , a 2. yp ✓ idr'' Thornberg let the Sheilch kno?/, through Mr. Belgrave, that B.P.C. would view the concession of the whole or part of the area to another Company with very great dislike. Further, he dropped a 'broad hint that if it took place the Company might slow down production on their present concession. The Sheikh and his family were ^mu^ph alarmed at this threat and the Sheikh showed a disposition to go back on his proposed scheme of division. In order to clarify the position he was advised, on our instructions, to communicate his scheme of division to the Companies in writing and invite their views and any, offers they might like to make. The Sheikh did so on 8th June, and the local representatives of 'both Companies replied on the f. 1*5,SH -I same day. B.P.C. indicated the extreme disfavour with which they viewed any division of the area and repeated in a veiled form the threat of slowing down production. They made an offer for the whole area which included a high initial payment of 4 lakhs. P.C.L. made ho advance on their previous financial terms; as regards the division of areas proposed, they suggested certain adjustments but on the whole seemed satisfied with the Sheikh's scheme. The Political Agent, through whom the correspondence was conducted, invited, the Sheikh's views in order that the matter might be submitted for the orders -I of H. M.G. The Sheikh replied the neirb day, 9th June, and indicated that he wished to abandon the original scheme and give the whole area with the exception isf the Hawar Islands to B.P.C. He was obviously under the influence of the Company's threat. The matter was at this stage submitted for the instructions of H, M. G. Mr. Walton said it was difficult to tell whether B.P. C. 's/% 3. B.P.C.'s threat v /as entirely 'bluff or not. If the Sheikh were only concerned, in choosing 'betv/eenthe terras offered 'by the Companies it might be a question which of their offers was the more favourable, since the higher initial payment of the B.P.C.'s offer might be balanced by the higher minimum royalty offered, by P.C.L. But obviously it was not such considerations but the threat of slowing down present production that weighed with the Sheikh. The current year's rate of production brought him in an income of some 50-55 lakhs. Mr. Peel mentioned that according to Mr. Belgrave the Sheikh and. his family feared that the American Company would be naturally tempted, to divert their energies to working the Hasa concession through the uncertainty of the prospect that conditions in Hasa would remain stable in the event of Ibn Saud's death, Mr. Starling thought that for economic reasons it was most unlikely that the Company vould voluntarily s down their production in Bahrein. They are believed to have sunk a large sum of money - a sum of four or five million had been mentioned - in Bahrein which they would naturally be anxious to recover, and they would want to keep and extend the markets available to them through the Texas organisation.. They might, of course, find themselves unable to maintain the present rate of production, since he understood there were reports of water 'being encountered in some of the welxs and it might oe that the oil field was not as good as had been expected. Mr. Belgrave was introduced to the meeting at this point and various aspects of the matter were discussed with him. He confirmed that the Sheikh and his family were genuinely afraid that the B.P.G. would carry out thexr threat. He recognised that on commercial and technical grounds/1 4. grounds it was probable that the threat was very largely- bluff, but he believed that it would be impossible to get the Sheikh to appreciate this argument and dismiss his , fears. As regards the risks of friction between the two Companies, of which B.P.C. had made much account, he did not himself think the risks were serious under the Sheikh's original scheme of division. He enquired whether there was any possibility of a friendly agreement between the two Companies, but Mr. Starling said this was not to be expected in view of the rivalry between the American group in P.C.L. and the Standard Oil Company of California. Mr. Belgrave said that while the Sheikh was not in any need of more money which would influence him in giving a concession in the rest of his territory, he would be seriously affected by a substantial reduction in his present income. Mr. Belgrave explained how it was proposed that this income should be utilised: for the Sheikh's privy purse, for expenditure (about 6 lakhs) on improvement of uhe administration , social services, etc., and for the building up of a reserve fund. When asked how the Sheiivh would view a suggestion that the negotiations might oe suspended, he expressed the opinion taat the Sheikh would himself be very pleased, and that his family, who were satisfied with the income they now received from him, would raise no objection. At present they, like tae Sheikh, were in favour of closing with the B.P.C., though they were prepared to give Hawar to P.C.L, There v/as no truth in the suggestion that the Sheikh was disposed to Cot 1 give Hawar to P.C.L. from a fear that ii he did not H.M.G. might be influenced to decide the question ox tae ownership of Hawar in favour of Qatar. Mr. Belgrave added, that he thought the Sheikh would be willing to give Fasht/5. Pasht DiToal as well as the Ha war Islands to P.C .L. ; this might help to simplify possible operations in the sea 'bed outside territorial waters between Bahrein and Qatar. In reply to Mr. Jonesj Belgrave said he thought it would he possible for P. G.L. to erect a refinery on Hawar if they wished. Mr. Jones said that the Admiralty would prefer that any refinery erected by P.C.L. should, for defence reasons, be situated in Bahrein Island, and considered that, whatever division was decided, the right should be reserved to P.C.L. to erect a Refinery in Bahrein should they wish. Mr. Belgrave said that if H.M.G. should decide that the Sheikh''s original scheme of division should be carried out the Sheikh would of course not refuse to comply. A consideration which had been in the Sheikh's mind was the possibility, if his original scheme were enforced, of obtaining from P.C.L. a guarantee to indemnify him against any loss he might suffer if B.P.C. put their threat into execution. Mr. Belgrave agreed that it would be almost impossible to work this out or to expect the Company to give such a guarantee. Mr. Starling said he was very much opposed to the method of auctioneering into which the negotiations threatened to develop. He explained to Mr. Belgrave that the general practice, at least outside the U.S.A., where most of the oil is in private ownership, was for Government to settle in advance the terms on which concessions could be given and to decide between competitors by their opinion as to which was the better Company. He felt strongly that to allow the Companies to bid against one another for the Sheikh's favour would have most unfortunate repercussions on oil negotiations elsewhere, both in the Persian Gulf and much further alield. Mr, Walton then thanked Mr. Belgrave for his great assistance, and the latter left the meeting. Mr./*u 6. Mr. Walton expressed the view that it would apparently he very difficult to persuade the Sheikh that he could without risk let P.C.L. in. 'Although Mr. Belgrave had said that the Sheikh would accept P.C.L.'s offer if pressed to do so, it would not he wise to force it on him. Mr. Brenan said that if the Sheikh were now to give P.G.L. what they wanted' there would he a possibility of representations heing made hy the United States Government accusing H. M.G-. of showing discrimination against their nationals and of influencing the Sheikh against his own expressed wish. Mr. Starling remarked that it must he remembered on the other hand that there was an American group in P. C. L. Major Grover informed the meeting that the Admiralty were strategically interested in the development of oil in Bahrein, though the quality was not entirely satisfactory since it contained a high sulpher content, hut in the event of war it would he of the utmost value, and therefore the Admiralty would dislike anything that tended to slow down production of oil in Bahrein. They thought that the hest solution would he for B.P.C. to get a concession minus the Hawar Island and possibly Pasht Dihal. The Admiralty would like, if possible, a pre-emption clause put in the agreement. v Mr. Jones enquired as to the possibility of a revision of the existing Agreement in this connection. Mr. Walton suggested that it would be reasonable to make a condition of the grant of the Unallotted Area to the B.P.C. that some of the terms of the existing concession as well as the new one should be revised. If war comes we should have no difficulty in persuading the Sheikh to exercise sovereignty pov/ers, but it might be better to have/7, have revision and so avoid the possibility of complaints from the American Government. A condition might he made also that the 'bulk of the oil should be refined in Bahrein which the Admiralty consider desirable from the defence point of view. Mr. Walton felt, however, that probably the best solution of the problem would be to advise the Sheikh to postpone a decision s ine die . This would enable him and H. M.G-. to see how things develop, and would not preclude the re-opening of the subject at a later stage. The meeting saw no objection to this proposal and Mr. Starling said that an argument in its favour which impressed him was that the enhanced prestige of the American Company if they now obtained the concession would have unfortunate repercussions on the negotiations which P.C.L. were conducting with the Trucial Sheikhs. A waiting period would also give time to test the effect of the development of the new Hasa oilfield on production in Bahrein. It was accordingly decided to recommend that action on these lines should be taken and that a carefully ¥\/orded communication, on which the Departments concerned should be consulted, should be made to the Sheikh to enable him to reply to the letters from the two Companies.i^ERNMENT OF INDIA.

Thornburg whose original object in coming here was to supervise Bahrain Petroleum Company 1 s security arrangements in event of war, has intimated that he proposes, now that peace seems assured, to approach Shaikh regarding Unallotted Area. 2. I think it would be both improper and futile for me to attempt to prevent approach, but I am reminding Shaikh that he should give no reply of any kind pending His Majesty's Government's final advice. I have told Thornburg this. I have also informed Packer, adding that I should act similarly if any P.C.L. negotiator came here. Note. I understand Company have already considered sending Holmes. 3. I have already communicated gist of India Office Express letter No. P.Z. 5882/38 dated the 1st September 1938 to Shaikh, who has asked for two or three days to consider reply, but was obviously not pleased. PoliticalMemorandum of His Highness's views regarding negotiations for an oil concession over the Bahrain un-allotted area. His Highness is grateful to the British Govern ment for assisting him with advice regarding the additional area. He is confident that the British Government would not wish him to do anything which might be detrimental to the future interest of Bahrain and especially to the revenue of the State. His Higlmess considers that the Bahrain Petro leum Company have reasonable cause to fear inter ference if another oil company were grated a con- | cession in Bahrain territory. His Highness believes that such interference might have the effect of reducing development by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. His Highness's territory is small. The existing oil concession includes most of the country and His Highness is doubtful whether there is room in Bahrain for two large rival oil companies to work without friction. The revenue from oil is of vital importance to Bahrain. The pearl industry, previously the source of Bahrain's prosperity, is suffering from^depression&lt;L\ from which it is unlikely to recover, The present revenue is perhaps sufficient for the present administration of the country but it is not sufficient for important developments which His Highness contemplates. Oil is not a lasting proQUct. There is no guarantee that the supply will last more than 15 or 20 years. In this time it is of the utmost importance to build up a Reserve Fund which will provide an assured income for the country when oil begins to diminish. His Highness cannot agree that he is satisfied with the present income from Royalties. His Highness has no wish to cause disappoint ment to either of the oil companies but he regards them both as commercial concerns who are competing for the same object and he thinks it is inevitable that one of them will be disappointed. His Highness does not feel that he should sacrifice anything which is to the interest of nis country in order to prevent a commercial firm from suffering disappointment at not obtaining something which it never owned.His Highness does not see any advantage to be gained for Bahrain by the further post- poneraent of negotiations. He would like to settle the matter finally as soon as possible. A matter which has affected his opinion in this matter is the urgent need, which has lately become apparent, of revising certain clauses and making certain alterations in the existing agree ment with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, to safe guard the interests of Bahrain in the future, including increasing the minimum royalty which is now li lakhs. His Highness wishes to raise this amount. His Highness also wishes to make an arrangement to govern the proportion of imported oil and Bahrain oil which is refined in Bahrain and various other matters, the details of which have not been fully discussed. His Highness thinks that it would be possible now to improve various conditions in the agreement which could not be altered afterwards. pis Highness considers that the remaining area might be discussed as a whole and not dividedinto two portions as was previously suggested.(SH- Telegram Q From Political Resident at Kuwait, To Political Agent, Bahrain.

These had been set out in the form of a memorandum, an English translation of which I forward herewith. The statement of views is full and free from ambiguity, save in respect of certain possible changes in the existing Agreement with the Bahrain Petroleum Company and of the disposal of the Hawar Islands. I confined my enquiries, therefore, to these two points. I was informed, in regard to the first, that His Highness and his advisers had had insufficient time to consider fully the additions and alterations they might wish to insert in the Agreement, (in plain fact they do not quite know what they want apart from the specific points mentioned in the memorandum). They will however discuss this matter with me further when their ideas are c learer. In regard to Hawar, they no longer wish to offer this area to Petroleum Concessions Limited, and at present they do not appear to have decided whether they should, in order to avoid friction with Qatar, exclude the Hawar Islands from the proposed new Concession to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, or include them and mark them as 'closed to operations'. 4. I undertook to forward this memorandum and repeated that there must be no communication to either Company until the final advice of His Majesty 1 s Government is conveyed to the Shaikh. His Highness assured me that he had no intention of holding any communication with the Companies meanwhile. 5. I think I should attempt some explanation of the new attitude adopted by His Highness and his brothers. At first sight/-OpD **3* sight one would assume that they had been subjected to pressure by the American Company, but on reviewing the past few months I do not believe this to be the true explanation. The 'active agents' on behalf of the Bahrain Petroleum Company have throughout been Mr. Thornburg and Hussain Yatim - the latter behind the scenes. The former only returned to Bahrain a few days ago and, apart from a formal call, aas not yet seen His Highness and his brothers. Hussain Yatim has been in Europe and he also has only just returned. I need not unduly lengthen this letter by giving my further reasons for the belief, which is shared by Mr. Belgrave, that American influence is not the cause. 6# On the other hand I have for some time doubted if the belief in His Highness 1 entire contentment with his (and the State 1 s) present income was altogether warranted. It would be unjust to speak of avarice or greed in connection with Shaikh Hamad, but he spends his money freely • and enjoys it. It may be illustrative to note that his sole comment on the last royalty cheque for over 18 lakhs of rupees was that he trusted the next one would be better. Finally, the Administration is faced by the dual necessity for creating a large Reserve Fond and financing simultaneously various major schemes as soon as they possibly can. Both these are admirable objectives, but they serve to sharpen both the desire for increased revenues and the fear of retarded development of the American Company's existing Concession. * 7. There is another point of much importance to which attention should be drawn. The pearl industry is moribund, and, so far as I can judge, the Gulf Arabs have now come to the/--4- the dismal conclusion that it is unlikely ever to recover. It is to this that I ascribe much of the unrest which has manifested itself lately&gt; and the leaders of the A1 Khali- xah iamily have9 I believe| come to much the same conclu sion. This renders it all the more important to them to consider how best they can increase their revenue from oil, or at the very least how to ensure most effectively that that revenue cannot fall below a certain figure. I'hey believe| not without reason, that the latter object certainly, and probably the former, can be secured by settling with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. There have already been suggestions of a minimum royalty of Rs. 5 lakhs and of a fixed ratio between Bahrain and Hasa oil passing through the Refinery; while as for the possible development of the Unallotted Area they have only to ask themselves which Company is in the better position to set about the task the more rapidly. 8. Thus the whole basis of the belief that His Highness would welcome postponement has disintegrated. And while he would undoubtedly seek to avoid causing offence to His Majesty 1 s Government, he is confident they will see the matter as he does - as a matter mainly affecting the pros perity and contentment of Bahrain - and will not advise him against his own interests. As for his attitude towards the Companies, the memorandum now forwarded puts his feel ings bluntly, and I suspect that he and his brothers no longer suffer from the delusion that Petroleum Concessions Limited is a purely British Company. 9. I might perhaps add the following information. The London and Mew York offices of the American Company have apparently had wind of the postponement proposal and view it/--5- ftp n/ it with considerable disfavour. A postponement sine die necessarily leaves them in a state of suspense, and, since it is inevitable that some member of the A1 Khalifah will sooner or later disclose to them the gist of the present memorandum, it may be expected that they will use every endeavour to 'aid' its acceptance by His Majesty^ Govern ment, 10.

This may well be blufx, but at least there is always the chance that the Americans will try to play Lord Cadrnan at his own game (as Thomburg putjit.) And they possess bmvery awkward card - the assurance twice given to Lallantyne • in London that 'i would not interfere if H .H. should choose to give- the whole Unallotted Area to either Bapco or P.C .L,', an- 'whether the area should ^ be ^iven wholly to one Company or the other * • • * was t matter xor the sheikh to decide and II.Ii.G.'s attitude was neutral and unbiassed', ( see enclosures to I»0» Printed Letters No P,2», 31:34 dated the 14th ana I/th liay 1938,^ 5, I itilly realise that P,C,L, will, if K.U .G. accept . s ( lews, accuse the 1.0, and us of responsibility for their losing Banram*, But can we not convince everyone, including F,C ,L, themselvss, th. t this is entirely unyrue by a simple statement of facts?

The ^'olitical \gent Bahrain*s letter would seeia to reinforce tnearguments for the, opinion I gave in paragraph 6 of ay Express Letter So.3/^37, dated the 19th June 1938. His Majesty's Government* proposal that the lhaikh should postpone his decision sine die is obviously most unacceptable to him, and if this suggestion is turned into a decision he will certainly feel that his interests and those of bis state have been sacrificed, ahich opinion will, l thinJc, be shared by all his subjects. In this connection His Highness*e arguments in paragraph 3 of his Meaomndura beginning 'The revenue from oil is of vital Importance to Bahrain* are of much weight. \ 'Lo further / {Signature) {Destgmtim) S. 44. \t1?t&gt; l01q«-«rp ntt-iqoqx '8 a ftfifi4./ V1 -2- Birtlier the knowledge that Hia Majesty's had preTented the Bahrain State from inoreaaing Ite Inooae eonelderably would naturally have a deplorable effect not only locally but in the neighbouring Arab eountriea, where it would of course bee one public property and the subject of much adverse comment. 3. Similarly 1 do not imagine that the Bahrain Petroleum Company would accept, with any equanimity, a sine die decision owing to the uncertainty in which th^y would be placed. In ^ mifolrn-i,, this connection please see enclosure to India Office letter Mo. P./..3334/38, dated the 14th May 1936, to recording a conireraation rhich Ballantyne had with Ofibson, In this record the following sentence occurss Whether t/ie area should be given wholly to one Oompahy or the other or divided between them was a matter for the shaikh to decide and His Majesty's Oorernment's attitude thereto aras neutral and unbiassed.* It seems to me quite probable that if His Majesty's aoTernment block the Bahrain Petroleum Company at Bahrain the Company may consider their agreement with Hie Majesty's Government not to enter %e Tru^ial Coast (vide Mr .Ballantyne's ie11er dated the l^th tarch 1937 . India Office lo.?.^. 1371/37) at an end, and may enter that area, fhis of course would be most undeairaisle. Against this particular argument is the fact that once Petroleum aoncesaions Limited have obtained the remaining concessions on tae 'racial coast they will not be able to operate there. ?he fact remains however that at present Petroleum Concessions Limited have obtained only two out of a poaaible seven.V b -3- 4. It will be seen that the Shaikh now tloea not even arieh to give Hawar to Petroleum J one ea a ion a Limited. I am not of opinion that .?e shcaild accept thia. In this connection see paragraph 3 of ay gxpresa Letter quoted above. Hawar geo graphically is outside tae Bahrain area and adjoining /.atar, where Petroleum Conceaaiona Limited already have a concession and la fairneaa therefore it should go to thaa. In connection with the oraershi^ of Hawar please see joorrespondence ending I • with your :a3cpress Letter lo .P.i.. 496^3, dated the 21st July 1938. I am enquiring from the Polltioal Agent Bahrain whether any reply has been recelred from the Shaikh of q ^atar. 5. Should His MaJeaty's Government accept the recaacaenda- tlon made In my immediately succeeding paragraph, I think that opportunity might be taken of insisting on the insertion in the concession for the Unallotted Area a pre-emption clause In favour of His Majesty's Government to cover not only the product from the Unallotted Area but also from the present concessional area. S. In conclusion personally I definitely of opinion that His Majesty's aovernment should inforai Shaikh that with reference to the final paragraph of his Memorandum they agree to his proposal provided Hawar is allotted to Petroleum Oonceesions Limited but not otherwise. sd.

Negotiations would thus be resumed in near future witn both Companies. It is not anticipated that they would be unduly prolonged. On hearing from His Highness that he agrees to Petroleum Concessions limited's request we will inform Bahrain ^etroleum Company who it is understood are also prepared to appoint a representative to negotiate. His Majesty's Government do not wish to influence Shaikh's attitude in his negotiations with either Company.

His Highness agreed that this was so and expressed pleasure in having seen Bahrain oil on stile in India and satisfaction at the expenditure of the company at Bahrain.

Mr..Davies asked why another company should be enabled to reap the benefits of the Bahrain Petroleum Company*s ,.-ork in Bahrain mid said that liiia was inevitable if another ooioipcmy v^bm 1b% in# His oompany had been lad to believe during the past negotiations that their right of preferential treatment was admitted. The company was better prepared than any other company to start and carry out new work and increased dovelopaent and possessed the organisation =md equipmont on the spot. The Shaikhs admitted tills. Tho Bahrain Petroleum Ccastpany had eigiit years experience in Bahrain, othar companies had long pagelong sxpsrierio© olsewhsra but axporience in Bahrain was important • Tli© ocsapany* s rela- tioxis with ills Highness and his people w©re His Mtgmmmagraefi that this wae so. The cowpany was in a bettor position than any other companj to develop Bahrain oil, Bahrain oil was not sufficiont to fulfill the company's mrket obligations and they wsro coamslled to orAni-t oxl from United States of America to sell in India, China and sins hero. Othar ooapfctnies had largo oil reserves and aid not need to produce mors than thsy produced at present. The Shaikhs appreciated these arguments which were known to them. Shaikh Mohomed enquired whether Mr, Davies was going: to make an offer in writing, fir, Davies was asked to put in a written note covering the gist of the matters discussed, Mr, Davies pointed out that his company had built in Bahrain the most modem oil refinery ? in the world, lie said that his company's last offer still held good, it \fa« not dependent on their elate of preferential right, but was made as generous as it was thought my other company could possibly make, Mr, Davies then stated the terms of the offer end expl ined that his compeny was prepared to con sider raising the amount of minimum royalty in the existing concession. The following points were then discuased. The Shaikhs enquired whether a definite time limit would be agreed upon within which the company would commence drilling. Ho definite period was stated but it was understood that drilling would comaonce as soon as the preliainary survey was conpleted and this would be dose without delay. Diligent prosecution of geological examination wa« promised and past history referred to as a basis of what diligence meant to the company. His Highness explained thnt there were certain portions of his territory which he Ad shod to exclude 1'rom the iigreement, Mr. Davies su^ested that an -•igreoLient could be made covering the whole of the territories with a clause stipulating that certain areas should not be developed or used without His Highness*s consent. page -5-f- Amli # De ember 26, 1936 C m Dalryuple Bolgrave, Esq., Adviser to the GovorDcient of Bahrain, BsJiroln* Bear Sir: As requested by you, I as pleased to let you have in vrriting my Cojiipariy , s offer for the Bahrain Unallotted Area, This letter contains the terns of the offer as set out in our lett or of June G, 1938, addressed to Ills Britannic Majesty*s Politioal Agent, ajaplified and defined In accord ance with our oemversation of December 26, 1938# We request that ills Highness be advised as follows: My Company Is prepared to p ay His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrein Rs.4,00,000 upon the granting of a concession covering all territory, including waters, now under the dominion of His Highness or later acquired by him or his successors within the period covered by the present Mining Lease, other than that already held by oy Company under its present Mining Lease.

December 31, 1938 • CO Dear Sir: Further in connection with my Company's written offer contained in the letter addressed to you dated December 28, 1938, will you kindly advise His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain as follows: To indicate to His Highness that my Company is ready and anxious to do all within its power to guarantee that there shall be no decline in the prosperity of Bahrain, and with the hope that such action will speed up negotiations and bring them to a prompt conclusion giving my Company the Concession agreement it is asking for,* I have today increased the minimum royalty provision under the heading 'Third Alternative w in my former letter to Es.12,50,000 per year for the first half of the 15 year period, under the same conditions as given in that letter. The other tems remain as set out in that letter. In response to the request made by Sheikh Mohammed, I am pleased to repeat the assurance which has already been given to Highness. Will you be so kind as to assure His Highness that, as in the past, my Company will continue in the future to give all possible consideration to Bahrain and its welfare. My Company hopes that at no time during the period mentioned will it be necessary to cut Bahrein's production back to the- 2 - number of tons represented by this minimum royalty figure. In order that there may be no misunderstanding between us, however, I wish to point out that the decision as to the aotual quantity of oil to be produced — whether it will be more than this figure and if so, how much more — must rest solely with the Company, In this connection the Company will of course have to take into account such factors as market demand, available sources of supply, developments or events unforeseen now, and the like* It is because of the uncertainty of these factors that my Company has been willing to set such a high figure — more than eight times the present minimum. This amount of income should ensure to His Highness that Bahrain's prosperity will continue even if it should prove necessary or advisable to produce at the minimum rate stipulated. I trust this letter will give His Highness the assurance he wishes and that we can have his decision soon. Tours faithfully.

I informed you that I was instructed by His Highness to tell you that your offer was very much lower than that of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and to enquire from you whether you wished to recon sider and increase the offer. I mentioned that the Bahrain Government regarded the minimum royalty as a matter of the greatest impor tance and I also said that the six years option period was considered extremely long, I told you that the Bahrain Government was considering the area as a whole. Tou explained that the six years period might be reduced. The matter of imported oil from Saoudi - iirabia was mentioned and there was some conversation about territorial waters. I understood from you that you were of the opinion that your company would wish to withdraw from competi tion partly because the Bahrain Government might include the question of imported oil as a factor in its negotia tions with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I informed you that I was not at liberty to dis close the particulars of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's offer for the concession without further reference to His Highness. lours sincerely, Major Frank Holmes, Bahrain.- COPY. ^ COKFIDENTI..L. Dated 5th. January 1939 Dear With reference to your letter No. 1978/9-A^20 dated January 4th. 1939. - • Thert: seems to have been some misunderstandinf regarding what we both desired to convey at our meeting on the 3rd. January. Z. I was under the impression that you told me in the early part of our talk that H.H. had, to all practical pnr- poses already decided to give the whole of the unallotted areas and waters to the Bahrain Petroleum Co., as a result of several meetings between you and the Ruler and a Bahrain Petroleum Co^ representative which culminated in a high offer with which in your opinion my Company would not wish to compete. I gathered that this offer either consisted partly of, or included, a guaranteed minimum annual payment v/hich was designed to reassure the Ruler that his revenues would not suffer as a result of the importation of oil free-of tax from Arabia. r ou stated later however that H.H. delegated you co inquire from me whether P.C.L. wished to reconsider and incrmse their offe . You gave the impression that the Ruler and yourself felt, if not assumed, in view of B^PGO♦s attractive offer, that icy Company would not be prepared to offer anything acceptable to H.H. I stated that this assumption should not be made. I have cabled my Company the position as herein stated, and asked for instructiohs, but so far I have not received a rec- ly. I will communicate with you again after hearing from London. 4, I endeavoured to explain to you that my Companv would find it very difficult to amend their offer if thr had' to make provision in it for possible compensation for loss of revenue as a result of decreased production by BAPCO and, in these exceptional,^ if not unique circumstances, it seemed reasonable and equitable that T should be informed of the minimun annual royalty which was to be guaranteed and particulars of BAPCO's offer bearing on this new factor in Concession-negotia tions. I note that you will refer to H.H. for permission to disclose this information. 5. As regards your para (4) it was never ray inten tion to convey that my Company would to withdraw. In this connection see my para (4) above. 6. It would seeraphat the misunderstandings revealed could best be cleared up at 'another meeting in the near future and I trust the conclusions of your letter have not been commu nicated so far to any other parties.

Mr. Ballantyne at his own request called on Mr. Walton and Mr. Gibson on 13th December to enquire what was the present position of the Unallotted Area cuestion and to express the anxiety of his Company that the matter might be decided as early as possible. They had some reason to think that the Sheikh would prefer to give them the whole of the Unallotted Area. Mr. Walton explained that the delay had been partly due to the Sheikh's absence through illness, that the matter had been recently under the consideration of Government and the Sheikh and that there was a possibility that the Sheikh might wish to re-open formal negotiations with the two Companies. A representative of the other Company was now about to ask the Sheikh whether he would be willing to re-open negotiations, and the Bahrein Petroleum Company might wish to consider at once the desirability of getting a representative on their behalf to Bahrein as early as possible. Mr. Walton made it clear that His Majesty's Government did not propose to influence the Sheikh's decision, but had asked that, if he was prepared to discuss matters with the Petroleum Concessions Limited representative, the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be given equal opportunity to state their case and their offer. Mr. Ballantyne said he would discuss matters at once with his Company. It might be that they would wish to send Mr. Thornbury back to Bahrein for the purpose. He/2. He was now In New Yorlc? but could probably reach Bahrein in less than three weeks. Mr. ..alton said that a delay of a week or two would not be material at this stage, and that the Sheikh would be asked, if he decided to re open negotiations, not to commit himself in his discussions with the Petroleum Concessions Limited representative pending such brief interval as may be necessary for the arrival or appointment of the representative of Mr. Ballantyne's Company. Mr. Ballantyne, in referring to the possible choice of the Company of a representative for this purpose, said he thought Mr. Thornbury would probably be considered by them to be the most suitable person. He himself was aware that Mr. Thornbury ? s excellent qualities were liable to be obscured by an occasional crudity of manner. In the course of an explanation of the Sheikh's desire to arrange with the Company a revision of his minimum royalties Mr. Ballantyne let it appear that his reference to 'crudity of manner' was to • 9 Mr. Thornbury's action in the early summer in playing on the Sheikh's fears (which Mr. Ballantyne asserted were already in existence) that Bahrein production might suffer by the development of the Hasa oilfields, Mr. Ballantyne said that this was a mistake and a step of which he could not approve, and further he said that (as the Sheikh must, he thought, know quite well) the Company, even though developments in Hasa might oblige them to some extent to curtail production in Bahrein, would not wish to reduce their Bahrein production to such an extent as would seriously affect the Sheikh's income. In reply to a question by Mr. 17 alt on he said that the Company's representative/representative in the approaching negotiations (if they took place) would not resor\- to the argument or threat of curtailed production in stating their case, and that Mr. Thorhbury would wish to remove any misapprehension which mm- he might have caused on the earlier occasion. Mr. Walton said that it was of course for the Company to decide whom they would send as their negotiator. Finally Mr. ,/alton took the opportunity to touch on His Majesty's Government's desiderata, if the ianerican Company should acquire an additional area. He assumed that in that event the Company would probably have a fresh agreement with the Sheikh covering the whole of the area of their concession, and he said that, in accordance with the procedure now followed in Koweit and elsewhere, the Company would be asked to enter into an agreement with His Majesty's Government which would cover all the political considerations and which in particular would deal with the question of pre-emption in time of emergency and possibly also with refinery questions. Mr. Dallantyne said there would be no difficulty at all about this. His Company expected it. They were well aware that even at present their production might be taken over by the Sheikh under His Majesty's Government's advice in a time of emergency and indeed their contracts in recent months had been drawn up with a saving clause providing for interruption by 'force majeure'.Telegram 'S 1 From Political Agent, Bahrain, To Political Resident, Bushire Repeated to India Office, London Copy by post to Government of India, New Delhi, No, 5 Dated 8th January 1939, Immediate Bahrain Unallotted Area, Strenuous efforts are being made, unquestionably on Holmes* instigation, to induce Shaikh of Bahrain to believe that if he gives Unallotted Area to the Bahrain Petroleum Company he will forfeit protection of British Government.

Shaikh Mohomed informed Mr. Davies that he would . like to close the negotiations and to advise His Highness to agree to the offer and conditions put in by Mr. Davies but the other company had made a new offer which His Highness was regarding more favourably. He pointed out that there were two matters which His Highness regarded as being of the greatest importance. One matter was that certain areas or land should be excluded from the agreement as in some cases they were used by His Highness for hunting purposes. The other matter was the old question of ensuring that increased import of oil should not reduce the output of Bahrain oil. These two matters were the subject of discussion lasting about four hours. Eventually a formula was arrived at regarding the exclusion areas, that the island of 'Om-al-Nasan', the remainder of Manamah island and Muharraq. should not be drilled in without permission from His Highness which would not be withheld if the company showed reasonable proof of indications of oil, such per mission to be given without additional payments or obligations. Regarding refining of Arabian oil a formula was discussed to the effect that the figures given, i.e., half the total output of E0,0u0 barrels daily should be the lowest figures and the company would do its best to keep the output at a higher amount. Certain other matters were mentioned such as a clause stating that in case of war all places inside the concession area could be used freely for military defence measures. A revision in the wording of the section regard ing employment of Bahrain subjects was mentioned also a clause referring t9 right of passage of ships or boats in waters included in the concession. Drafts for wording^ the exclusion clause and Arabian oil clause were written in Arabic for the consider ation of His Highness.n SVA/ 1 % ^ I n/,/39. &gt; i ' A?ali« January 12, 1939. 10 &gt;1 w &gt; pre- f C, Dalryiij^le Belgsav©, Esq, j Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. Bear Sir: following consideration by ssy Coripany of the letter of January 3rd, 1939, signed by Shaikh Mohomed bin laa , ShaiJch Abdulla bin Isa, Shaikh Sulman bin liaimd, and yourself, and as a result of further discussions between us, my Company is pre- pared to aaend the offer nQ.de in sy letter of Bececiber SOj 1938, to read as follows, and requests that you advise His Hictoess the ShaiMi of ^hrain accordingly. My Company is prepared to pay His Highness the sum of Rd.4,00,000 upon the granting of a concession covering all ter ritory, including territorial seas and the .lands submerged onder those seas, now under the dominion of His Highness or later acquired by or his successors within the period covered by sy Company's present Mining Lease, other than that already held by ny Conpany under its present Mining Lease. It is ray Conpany , s intention that its present Mining Lease will be extended to cover the Unallotted Area to ' hich the present offer pertains, such extension to include the following obligations applying specifically to the Unallotted Area: My Conpany will pursue, with diligence and without unnecessary delay, ceolORlccl r-ork In the Unallotted Area in- oludins structure drillinG end geophysical 'rork li necessary.My Company will drill test wells for oil vfiierever geological evidence warrants, comoncing operations on the first test well not later than years after the date such Concession is granted, if a favorable area has been found. If oil is dis covered, my Company Mil continue drilling further wells until oil in commercial quantities {daily average of 500 tons pro duced in accordance with good oilfield practice) has been obtained or until the area is no longer deemed favorable. Upon discovery of oil in commercial quantities my Company will continue drilling within the productive area until the require ments of good oilfield practice have been met, this obligation however being subject to suspension during such time as wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average of at least 1,000 tons of oil, produced in accordance with good oilfield practice. In addition to the above obligations applying specific ally to the Unallotted Area, my Company will also agree to increase its drilling obligation under the present Mining Lease, Baring the period of one year following the date such Concession is granted, my Company will maintain at least 4 strings of tools in continuous operation within the area covered by the present Lease, The royalty provisions of Article VII of the present frMnW Lease will continue over the larger area and my Company will undertake that the amount received by His Highness in respect of royalties shall not be less than Rs,1^,50,000 per year for a period of 15 years from the date such Concession is•• J5 •• O granted, nor loss than Rs # 17,00,000 per year for the same period if oil in commercial quantities is found outside the area already- held by ray Company under its present Mining Lease, providing the wells drilled are capable of producing the equivalent amount of oil in accordance with good oilfield practice and subject to Article IV of the present Mining Lease amended as follows: 'The Sheikh undertakes to give all the protection in his power to the Company and to their staff and laborers in any part of his territory from thefts, highway robbery, assault, &amp;o. Similarly the Sheikh undertakes to protect all the property of the Company and of their employees which may be exposed to wilful damage or to possible loss by theft. tt If the Company 's work is delayed by such events as are mentioned in this Article or by force majeure either on Bahrein or elsewhere then the period shall be added to the period for which this lease is granted and the annual minimum royalty provided for in this Agreement shall not be payable in respect of such delay* 'Force majeure as used in this Agreement includes the Act of God, vis major, war, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, tide, stem tidal wave, flood, lightning, explosion, fire, earthquake, malice or negligence or default of any third party and any other happening (whether solely due to the forces of nature or not) whichthe Company oould, not reasonably have foreseen or if they had foreseen, could not reasonably have pre vented, averted or controlled.' Following the 15 year period, my Company Tdll under- take that the amount received by His Highness in respect of royalties shall not be less than Rs.3,00,000 per year if oil in commercial quantities has been discovered in the 'Unallotted Area' and Hs.1,50,000 per year if such oil has not been found, both of these figures being subject to the delay clause above and the larger being subject to the 'ability to produce' clause as well. My Company will also undertake that, for the same 15 year period, not less than one-half the oil processed in the Bahrain refinery up to a total refinery throughput of 00,000 barrels daily, and if oil in commercial quantities is found outside the area already held by my Company under its present ng Lease that not less than one—half the oil processed in the Bahrain refinery up to a total refinery throughput of 25,000 barrels dally, shall be oil produced in the territory oi Bahrain, providing the wells drilled are capable of producing that much oil in accordance with good oilfield practice, and subject to the present Article I? amended as above. Thoabove mentioned figures are minimum figures and my Company, while it can make no further guarantee, is pleased to assure His Highness that, in the event this Concesoion is granted, it has every expectation of being able to maintainthe production of Bahrain oil at least at a figure approximating the present production so long as the wello drilled are capable of producing that much oil in accordance with good oilfield practice. My Company is also prepared to agree that, although they will he included in the area covered hy the Concession, my Company will not drill on Uram Hassan Island, nor within the municipal boundaries of Manama and Muharrek, nor in the vicintty of hunting lodges now established on Manama Island, without first obtaining the permission of His Highness. There will of course be no further payment or consideration in return for these permissions, when granted. In this amended offer, my Company has met all the wishes of His Highness up to the limit of its ability to do so without jeopardizing the economic interests of the Company, It has made an offer for the Unallotted Area in its entirety which guarantees a continuation of income to Bahrain from its oil resources far beyond what it thinks any other Company can possibly make. In addition to these guarantees, my Company has stated what its expectations are as regards the amount of oil it will be in a position to produce from Bahrain if a Concession covering the remainder of His Highness* domain is granted to it. The strength of such intentions on the part of ray Company is well indicated by its past performance in His Highness* territory, wherein it has unfailingly far exceeded its stated obligations, I should like to point out also that the probability of those intentions being fulfilled isfurther strengthened by the fact that ray CkM-apany* a markets are rapidly expanding. I believe that His Highness, who has the welfare of Bahrain and his people so iraich at heart, cannot help but favor this offer over any other which can be made. Yours faithfully. Representative the bahkken petroleum company limited mmwi*V Note on meeting held at Sakhir on 9th January 1939 at which were present, His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad, Shaikhs Mohomed, ikbdullah and Sulman. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Major Frank Holmes, Mr. E. 1. Packer, Mr. Ashraf, Secretary to Major Holmes. Major Holmes stated that he had received telegraphic instructions from his company telling him to ask for a private interview with His Highness. He requested His Highness to give him a hearing without interrup tion. He then informed His Highness that he wished to withdraw his previous application for the whole unallotted area, land and sea, and to submit a new offer for the Hawar islands and the waters. The new draft agreement was produced, in English with an Arabic note showing the changed terms. The terms briefly were as follows 1. Initial payment Rs 3 lakhs which was raised during the discussion to four lakhs. 2. iinnual payment, until oil in commer cial quantity declared, Rs 80,000/- 3. Royalty Rs 3/8 per ton. 4. Minimum royalty, after oil in commer cial quantity declared, 3 lakhs per annum. 5. Commercial quantity, 1400 tons per day. 6. Drilling obligations. In first 4 years 4,000 feet. ' 10 ' liilooo ' ' 20 ' 40,000 ' The iirabic note containing all the particulars of the above terms was handed to Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa who told His Highness that he would examine it in detail. Shaikh Mohomed retained the Arabic note and the English draft was retained by the Adviser. His Highness made no comments on any of the clauses with tne exception of the initial payment which was first set at 3 lakhs. The question of the three lakhs was the subject of much conversation and was finally raised to 4 lakhs. His Highness stated several times during the talk that the offer was a little less than that of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and when the three lakhs was eventually raised to 4 lakhs he expressed his pleasure and stated that the offer was now near the opposition offer. Major Holmes pointed out, and showed on the map, that the company required surface rights over a plot of land near Budeya and mentioned drilling a—3— -2- / drixlmg a water well there. This started a Jiscussion m which Shaikhs Suloian and Mohomed took part about the ownership of the land in question (both of them being personally interested ln 1 -' * r r- 16 highness took some part m this dis- cussioii but made no comments on tne suggestion# His Highness stated that he did not wish any oil company to work at the end of the MmiamAh island as the area was limited and stated that he did not intend to give such rights to any one in that area or on the island of 'Om-al-^asan'. His Highness when the question of shoals and deep waters was mentioned enquired how the boundaries oi the sea would be defined. The map in the draft agreement was produced and the area was des- crabed to His Highness who said that the line on the western side of Bahrain extending down the iiainain islands should be changed slightly as it might involve Bahrain in a dispute with His Maiestv xving ibn baoud. Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa added that Bahrain did not admit that Bainain belonged to iiing ibn baoud but at the same time it was un desirable to afford possibility of a disagreement. Major holmes agreed that the boundary line could be rearranged. Major Holmes said that the waters were five times the size of Bahrain, His Highness pointed out that although it was only a question of deep waters and shoals'and the Hawar islands idajor Holmes should not reduce his offer as the Bahrain Petroleum Company had offered much more* Major Holmes stated that the minimum royalty terms were similar to those in Kuwait although Banrain had so little land to offer. His Highness said that Hawar was half the area of Bahrain and thought oil would be found there at less depth than m Q,atar, During the whole conversation His Highness cons tantly referred to his friendship with the British Government and his regard for his old friend Major Holmes whom he addressed as 'Mumathal al Doulah (the representative of the British Government), bliaikh Mohomed and the Adviser pointed out that this was an inaccurate designation and likely to cause misunderstandings. His Highness said that he would willingly give the concession to Major Holmes if the company's offer came up to that of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. His Highness was told that he should not sell the friendship of the British Government. His High ness ignored the remark but Shaikh Mohomed inter rupted and said that this was an unsuitable thing to say.There was a discussion about the attitude of the British Government during which His Highness said that if Major Holmes had a letter from the British Government ordering His Highness to give the concession to Major Holmes' company he would do what was ordered. Major Holmes said it would be difficult to obtain such a letter as he gathered that the attitude of the British Government was that for diplomatic reasons they could not press the Ruler or interfere actively but would be pleased if British company succeeded. His High ness repeated his devotion to the British Government. Towards the end of the meeting when Major Holmes appeared to think that an agreement in general had been reached he pressed His Highness to allow him to send a telegram to his company saying that an agreement had been reached. His Highness did not agree to a cable being sent but before any telegram was sent he would have to five the matter his'consideration and he would also obtain the advice of the British Government on the matter.

H.H. was emphatic that he did not propose to grant a concession for any more of the main island to any one &amp; the changes in M .H's application were in accordance with his own wishes, ihe American Company were on the Island a,nd there was no land to spare now. M.H. M.H. explained that he had some changes in his concession draft and H.H. intimated that he would like- 3 - to hear the essentials. H.H. explained that his 'Pleasure Island 1 (Urn Nisan) must not be touched, and M .H. agreed that this was 'sound'. H.H. pointed out that although it was only a question of the deep waters, the shoals, and the Hawar Islands Major Holmes should not reduce his offer on this account, as the other side had offered much more. M * H * M.H. produced a new draft and explained the differences to the Adviser - which were chiefly that the Article regarding on optional period was deleted, and the following payments substituted : Initial Payment - 3 lakhs. Annual Payment up to declaration of oil in commercial quantities - Rs. 80,000. Annual minimum royalty on commercial production 2^- lakhs. (Royalty at Rs 3/8 per ton). Geological survey &amp; boring commitments were referred to in - Geological Survey to commence in 9 months - 4 ,000 ft. of drill ing in first 4 years - by 10th. year 12,000 ft. - by 20th. year 40,000 ft. Major Holmes also explained to the Adviser that Commercial production at 1,400 tons was reasonable owing to the difficulties of production in water. Adv. Mr. Belgrave then took notes of the period by which geological work must commence {9monthS) footage of boring in first four years (4,000ft.jetc. and explained that if the Govt, preferred the old articles on use of rigs these could be retained. The conditions were then gone over in detail with H.H. who did not raise any opposition . H.H. H.H. then raised the question of boundaries of the waters. M.H. M.H. said the waters were 5 times the size of Bahrain. H.H. H.H. pointed out that the boundaries of Ibn Saoud and those of the American Co. must bs respected. M.H. M.H. assured H.H. that this would be done. H.H. H.H. spoke on the terms and the fact that he was influenced by his friendships with the British Govt, and his old friend Major Holmes and his desire to help British interests. Adv. At this stage there appeared some doubt as to the attitude of the British Govt. being understood by the Ruler which the Adviser wished cleared up. M .H. M.H. explained that the attitude of the British Govt, as he gathered was that for diplomatic reasons, they could not press the Ruler or interfere actively but they will be pleased if a British Company succeeds.n— ii mm* \ - 4 - vW * i H«H, H.H. stated that he understood the position and the British Govt, were his esteemed and valued friends, to whom he looked for protedtion. He hoped Major Holmes would not take advantage of this factor when making offers. M.H. P.C.L. terms were now better than those of the Americans. H.H. Slightly short of. M .H. M .H. then stated that the terras as regards minimum royalty were similar to Kuwait, although Bahrain had so little lend to offer. H .H. H.H. remarked that Hawar was half the area of Bahrain and the oil in his opinion would be at a less depth than in ^atar. The area on the map was referred to and H.H. remarked that the western point was perhaps too near the Saoudi boundaries. M .H, M.H. agreed to amend the map to cover this criticism. M.H. then agreed to an initial payment of 4 lakhs. H .H. H.H. was obviously very pleased and remarked 'YOU are now near', (the opposition offer)? Adv. The Adviser raised the point of minimum commercial production and M .H. again explained the difficulties of production in water. M .H. M .H. pointed out that to work the concession Surface rights over a land base on Manamah Island were necessary. The position on the map of this suggested base was examined. M .H. explained the purpose of the base and that it would be necessary to drill a water well. H.H. H.H. reised no objection to this base or the well and^presumed any complication of land ownership could doubtless be solved. H.H. again mentioned that as regards terms M .H. 'had come very near'. M.H. M.H. replied that no question of money could come between them. Mow he had raised his offers he hoped H.H. would help him. He thanked H.H. for his courteous hearing and hoped that H.H. would take no action egainst the interests of his Co. H.H. H .H. replied that he was sure neither side would take any action not beneficial to the other. M.if. M'H* then asked if he could telegraph his principals that he had come to terms with H.H. * I H.H. H .H. said he wished to consider the matter well before fie telegram was sent.- 5 - V \V H.H. then said he would like a letter from the British Govt, approving the grant of the concession to P.C.L. H.M. explained the position taken up by the British Government again as far as he knew it. H.H. said he could not forget the benefits he had received from the British Government, &amp; he wished to submit the matter of the concession to the British Govt for their advice. P .C .L. Bahrain.

Correct, he asked His Highness to tell the other Shaikhs and myself, especially Shaikh Sulman, that we should not speak during the meeting. No, 2. His Highness said that the end of the island was so small that he did not want any oil works to occupy the places where he hunts. No, 3 and 4, Correct, His Highness did not understand fully what the land was needed for. Shaikh Sulman and Shaikh Mohomed became involved in a discussion about the ownership of that area. No. 5. Holmes tried to rush His Highness into saying that the deal was closed, he caught his hands, in the pearl bargaining manner and kept on urging His Highness to say he could wire acceptance. His Highness refused to do this. No. 6. There was a long discussion about the attitude of the British Government, His Highness referred to Major Holmes as 'the repre--2- 'representative of the 'Doulah' ' : both Shaikh Mohomed and I interrupted several times and pointed out that Holmes did not represent the British Government. His Highness said to Holmes that if the British Government had written to him ordering him to give the concession to Holmes he would do as he was told. Holmes said that it would be difficult to obtain such a letter. During this part of the talk His Highness was told that he should not sell the friendship of the British Government to the Americans, i.e., by giving a concession to the Bahrain Petroleum Company which would cause the British Government to with draw its friendship. Shaikh Mohomed interrupted and said with a good deal of anger that this was a most improper remark to make to His Highness, During the entire conversation His Highness had in mind the 4 lakhs which was offered as a preliminary payment, it was quite evident to us that he was not appreciating or understanding any of the conditions. No, 7. Correct, No, 8. Provided that Petroleum Concession Limited^ offer was better than the offer of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Regarding the conver sation, I have numbered the remarks,- 1, No real reason was given. 8, His Highness did not understand them and that the Shaikhs and I should look over them. The draft was written in Arabic on a _slip of paper which Shaikh Mohomed examined but His Highness did not, 13, His Highness did not discuss any of the terms or payments except the four lakhs.14. The doubt was not about the attitude of the British Government but our objection to Major Holmes becoming 'Mumathal al Doulah'. 30. This is incorrect. The whole interview was a lamentable dis closure of His Highness^ complete inability to appreciate and consider a matter of such great importance as the concession under discussion. When it was over Shaikh Mohomed reproached His Highness for having spoken several times without sufficient consideration at which His Highness said that he had not really said anything of a binding nature. lours sincerely, H 8 Weightman, Esquire.

Mr. Hussein Yiteem. /• Mr. Davies said that he had been told on 16th January 1939 by the three ihaikhs, (Sliaikhs Mohomeci, libdullah and Sulman) end the adviser that lis Highness wished to know what offer his company were prepared to make for the addi tional area, excluding the Hawar group of islands, Mr. Davies said that he was astounded at this proposition because all through the present negotiations the whole of the area has been under discussion and there had been no mention of excluding iiawar. His Ughness and those present agreed that this was the case, Mr. Dairies said that he was sure that his company's offer must be more advantageous to Bahrain than that of the rival company; he reminded His Highness of the -work that his com pany had done in Bahrain ^hich far exceeded its agreed obligations and which should entitle the company to preferential treatment; he pointed out that if the area was divided his company's security would suffer and it i&amp;ould be thought that the company had done something which was displeasing to the Euler of Bahrain and he enquired why His Highness suddenly contemplated excluding Hawar after negotiations had proceeded for so long for the whole area. He finally . stated that his company were not interested in a part of the area out were only interested in the whole and he informed liis Highness on behalf of the company that the offer which had been made would have to be withdrawn in its entirety if the area was to be divided. j. iiis Highness agreed that the offer for the whole area was not unfavourable and said that he was not trying to obtain more money. lie did aot propose dividing the area but mrely excluded Hawar which he considered giving to the other company in order that all parties might be satis fied and in order to prevent complications and difficulties in the future which ai^ht arise owing to the proximity of Bawar to the Petroleum ^ Concession Limited*s concession. He agreed that the dahrain Petroleum Company had brought great benefits to Bahrain and that they had sxceeded all their obligations, he nointea out that iiawar was a very small island and very far away and its loss to the company would not cause them any material loss. Ee ssntioned that Petroleum Concessions Limited was a British company but if the Bahrain Petroleum Company had obtained the «,attar concession there have been no difficulty about their having Hawar. lie assuredassured Mr, liaTies that his coapany^ ,vork la Sahrala^ »e» apgreeiated and finally he ottio th^t ix the Bahrain Petrolsua Coapany were not repared to make an offer for pert of the area ne supposed they had no objec tion to his inviting an offer from Petroleuia wonoessions Limited. .r. Davies said in his offer he had met every wish oi His Highness. liis company would U -ys respect their oblif:&gt;. tions. rie .vas not saking any threat and would do nothing as s deliberate reprisal for not getting what the company ms making for, something which th©y_i8lt entitled to and «f@re willing to pay for, but a new situation would arrive aa( tae coap uj oulahave to chart** a ne^ course. If a rival company was admitted his company would have to protect its interests. mt ,Davies pointed out that his company had sound economic reasons for running much Arabian oil as possible, reasons which ivere set aside when the company framed the offer indicating what it was willing to pay and the guarantees it was willing to give for the pri vilege of continuing to work with the secure feeling of the past, Ms Highness said that he thought he ought to ove hawar to the other company and it was a long way from Bahrain, I4r. Davies continued that it was not a matter of geographical position, his company's offer was gemrom for the sole purpose of obtaining the entire area and continuing the harmonious' and undisturbed relations between the company end the Ruler* Be asked what right had the otheroompany to expect even a small part of tils highnesses territory after the Bahrain Fetroleua yompanv had done so much for Bahrain, ue asked ais iiighness to consider his company's past work and to consider the offer and askea why another company should be allowed to come in and profit from all that the^Bahrain Petroleum company had done in Bahrain, His company had no divided foreign intereit in it: Petroleum concessions limited was partly British and partly foreign. His company was registered as a Jritish company and over 6u,i of the non-Asiatic employees were British, dis Highness said he was sure «r, Davies's company aid not wish to involve His ai, hness in trouble, ahaikh Abdullah pointed out that as yet nothing definite had been decided about the concession, all that had been done was an. en airy as to the company's reaction if the Mawar islands aere excluded, the other company had not yet been approached but His Highness haa thought it nece-f I necessary to first ascertain Mr* Davies's views on the new proposal. it im now clearly under stood that the Bahrain Petrolem Company* were not interested in anything but the whole, 10. iir. Daviac explained that the chief reason why his company were unwilling to hid for a divided area was cot because of the possible value of the area hut because they did not want another company to hold an oil concession anywhere within Eis iiighness's territory because from past experience they knew that if two companies held a concession in so small a country it would cause difficulties and mi sunderstand ings which would damage the Ikhrain i'etroleua Company's position vis a vis to the Ruler. 0 adviser, Bahrain GovezmentGOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

F. A. Davies, Mr. Hussein Yateem. Shaikh Mohomed stated that His Highness Shaikh Hamad wished certain points to be discussed particularly the matter of oil imported for refining in the Bahrain refinery. His Highness wished consideration to be given to this matter in order to prevent injury to Bahrain from the importing of crude oil from elsewhere. Mr. Davies stated that the import of oil for refining in Bahrain was not detrimental to the interest of Bahrain. He described the original circumstances leading up to the building of the refinery which was desired both by the Bahrain Government and the British Government. At that time the Bahrain government had seen the advan tages from a refinery being built in Bahrain. If the company had envisaged restrictions being placed on the quantity of oil to be refined it might have built the refinery elsewhere. Shaikh Mohomed mentioned that when the refinery was built only Bahrain oil was concerned. Shaikh Abdullah pointed out that His Highness^ fovernment had no wish to prevent foreign oil rom being refined but that it was desired to ensure that Bahrain should not suffer by the importation of foreign crude oil. It was agreed that both parties would benefit by increased activity of the company which should result if Saoudi oil should be refined in Bahrain. Mr, Davies explained that if a refinery had been built elsewhere then the company^ expenditure in Bahrain instead of being about Si lakhs per month as at present might be in the neighbour hood of 1 to It lakhs per month which would have been detrimental to Bahrain, therefore the exclu sion of foreign oil would not be to the interest of Bahrain and any restriction would be harmful to the company and Bahrain. The Shaikhs repeated that they did not wish to stop oil being brought in. but wished to ensure that the income from royalties would not decrease from this reason. They did not object to a certain quantity but were apprehensive of the results of large quantities'of Saoudi oil being brought over. Mr. Davies explained that Arabian oil must find its way to the markets if not through Bahrain the company must build a refinery elsewhere. Shaikh Mohomed enquired about the possibility of increasing the refinery.Mr. Davies stated that the company contemplated spending about 30 lakhs next spring on increasing the refinery by installing new plant, Mr. Davies stated that the company must be able to conform to outside conditions. If a refinery was built elsewhere it would not increase Bahrain production but would decrease the company's local expenditure. Shaikh.lohomed. 'We want one thing, a guarantee that oil from outside will not reduce our output'. Shaikh Abdullah agreed that the benefit from the refinery is in Bahrain but asked how they can prevent import of Arabian oil from reducing Bahrain output. Mr. Davies said that the company had no intention 9f deliberately reducing Bahrain output but that it must guard against political or economic changes. Shaikh Sulman. 'As Bahrain's and the company's interests coincide have you no means to satisfy us that we shall not be harmed?'. Mr. Davies. 'The minimum royalty is intended to cover any possibility.' Shaikh Mohomed. 'Our object is one. you and we do not wish to see Bahrain output reduced, except by natural causes, so cannot you give us some guarantee?' Mr. Davies. 'It has been written that the company has no intention of reducing Bahrain oil, but it is possible that amount of imported oil may increase slightly at the expense of Bahrain production, there is no such intention now but it might happen. A 50 million rupee investment cannot be tied up. Bahrain should consider the company's past history in the country and that it can depend on the company honesty.' J Shaikh Mohomed. 'It would be better to have a clear understanding to prevent future misunder standings, we do not want our oilfield to become dry and we do not want outside oil to reduce our output.' Shaikh Abdullah. 'Additional area will give more oil, we fear a decrease in the amount of Bahrain oil to be refined, we want an assurance.' fcr. Davies. 'It is not to the best interest of Bahrain to restrict the amount or source of oil refined in Bahrain.' Mr. Davies then made the offer of 12t lakhs for 7i years and 8t lakhs for 7i years which is con tained in his letter. Adviser, Bahrain Government.

Dear Belgrave, la endeavouring to axpiala tne present situation to m London principals I find ttoere are -aaong otiler- two point® wiiicii could be cleared up *itn advantage, (a) #e find we need a clear definition of t&amp;e area in reapect of the Mawar group wnica liia uigHness will permit us Ao apply for. we need a definite ruling as to whether we can apply for the territorial waters or whether it is His Highneas's intention that they are to be specifically excluded. It is felt that your reply at the aeeting of the 19th instant tnat territorial waters had not been mentioned or considered is unsatisfactory in that it is vague where vagueness is highly undesirable. Is there any objection to their being ••considered* and a ruling obtained at once? If there is such an objection it would seem that it aust be of interest to us. ^ , It seems reasonable to suppose that territorial waters should go with the Islands even if their exploration for any reason aust be restricted or postponed and our London principals hold similar views. , fhere is a recognised interpretation of territorial waters (3 nautical ailes or 3.4S4 land ailes) and there would appear no co^lication in including thea with the Islands. Our interest in their possible future disposal will be readily understood. Of course Qjfttar territorial waters would be respected. (b) During the meeting on the 19th when His Highness was explaining that after tae iiawar question had been settled P .C.L. would be given an opportunity of coiapeting for the waters you thought it appropriate to inform us tm BAPGO had already made an offer for tae 'waters- waich we took to mean from the point uader discussion at tae &gt; the waters as separate fro® the Hawar group. P.T.O.r&gt; -2- 22-1-39, Subsequently we gathered that tiie offer made by BaFCO was for the waters and the Eawar group combined. If these points could be cleared up we should be grateful.

Y. Packer, %Auo ^ Mr. K, P. Narayan, Adviser's Secretary, Major Holmes began by saying that there was a personal matter whicn he wished to make clear; he stated that he was representing a company, and had never posed as representing the British Government; all that he said was on behalf of his company. His Highness replied that he realised this. Major Holmes then explained that his company was an independent company and if His Highness gra ciously granted the concession, a new company would Be formed, a branch of the Iraq, Petroleum Company, but a separate company. He said that his company had a message from the India Office to the effect that the India Office were impartial in the matter. His Highness expressed his thanks to the India Office, to Major Holmes and the company. Major Holmes referred to a conversation with Shaikhs Mohomed, ibdullah and Sulman and the Adviser when he was invited to make an offer for the Hawar group of islands. He said he had so far done nothing in the matter because he wanted more particulars about the situation. He refer red to His Highness 1 s talk with Mr, Sklyros *t •% r\&lt;\r\\ s ♦ n l 1 i j_ &amp; * j_ ^ _ _ re- pared to give Hawar to his company June 1938] andsaid that after referring to (in . . . _ ' records he.gathered that His Highness was pre- - - - - - — —^ - -- — - - — . I i c | f H His Highness interrupted and said that now fresh negotiations had started. -^jor Holmes said he merely wished to remind His Highness about Hawar and tne waters and that His Highness had been prepared to give them to his company. He explained that the combination of Hawar and the waters was of greater value than either separately. His Highness stated that he did not wish to include the waters with Hawar, Major Holmes stated that he wished t9 make a sugges tion and asked if His Highness had fixed on the idea of not combining the two.His Highness said he wished to know what Major Holmes would offer for* the Hawar group of islands and if he did not make an agreement with the Bahrain Petroleum Company ne would then let Major Holmes offer for waters. Major Holmes said he had come to make an offer for the combined area* He said a base at Bahrain was necessary, the area marked on the map (near Budeya), Be offered 5 lakhs instead of 4 lakhs in the initial payment, commercial quantity to be 1400 tons as Before. Shaikh Abdullah asked Major Holmes to make an offer for the Hawar islands only. Major Holmes said he would value them at 50/50 and would offer 3 lakhs (initial payment). The Adviser enquired what would be the other obligations and terms in the offer for Hawar islands only. Major Holmes said the drilling obligations, number of feet per annum, would be as before stated. The Adviser suggested that Major Holmes might like to consider the matter and give his reply later. His Highness asked what would be the payment for Hawar islands and what conditions. Major Holmes said that the initial payment would be not less than three lakhs. It was arranged that Major Holmes should reply within a week. Maior Holmes asked if he would be allowed to offer for the waters again. « Shaikh Mohomed said that this would be consi dered when the reply about Hawar was received. Major Holmes enquired His Highness f s intention about the waters and was told that His Highness would inform him if he intended giving waters. Shaikh Mohomed and Shaikh Abdullah said that if the waters were to be discussed Major Holmes would be informed. Major Holmes enquired whether this offer was to be the final offer or if he could revise it later.(i-M Shaikh Mohomed said the last and final offer would be what Major Holmes should write about terms and conditions but he could rest assured that whatever the Ruler did would be the best and nothing would be done without his being informed* Adviser, Bahrain Government.

Dear Belgrave, Many thanks for your resume' of the meeting with His Highness on the 19th January received today - I left you a copy of our resume' made for our records at your office this morning. \ ^ ^ There are two points in yourversion to which I should like to draw your attention the first is a minor one but the second is important. f (1) On page 1 para 6. lou say n His Highness interrupted and said tnat now fresh negotiations had started': this conveys that H.H, was disclaiming anything ne had previously conveyed to Mr. Skliros. Our recol lection at this,stage was that H.H. said that 'you (Major Solmes) are now here for the purpose' (of negotiating) or words to this effect. (2) On page 2 para 1. The wording implies that the 'Bahrain Petroleum Company are to be given first refusal of the waters'. Neither Mr. Packer nor Mr. Ashraf (nor yourself we believe, heard so definite^ statement and in fact your own resume vide subse quent paras 11, 12, 13 &amp; 14 of page) makes it abundantly clear that it was His Highness's intention that Major Holmes should be permitted to 'discuss' the waters.

Oil negotiations, Reference to previous correspondence/t O h Note on a meeting held at Sakhlr on Thursday 26th January at which were present His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad Shaikhs Mohomed, Abdullah and Sulman, Adviser, Bahrain Government, Major Frank Holmes, Mr. E. V. Packer, Mr. Ashraf, Major Holmes's Secretary, Adviser's Secretary. (Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa was detained and did not arrive until towards the end of the meeting) Major Holmes began by saying that he had ins tructions from his company to say that the company wished to offer for the waters, if the other company could make an offer his company could also offer and pay. His Highness asked Major Holmes to first talk about Hawar and said it was his wish to discuss Hawar but if he wished to discuss other things later he would let Major Holmes offer. Major Holmes explained that he was quoting his company's wishes and it was his duty to do this. Regarding Hawar, it might be necessary to have a refinery there and to bring oil, to refine from outside for which the companj?' were willing to pay, the oil would probably be from the Trucial coast. His Highness said that he would consider this matter later, he then referred to the Qatar oil concession. His Highness discussed the question of free petrol for his cars and explained that the Bahrain Petroleum Company had at one time given him free petrol but now all petrol was charged for and he had to pay for repairs to his cars. He admitted that there was nothing about this in the concession. He understood that the Ruler of Qatar was given free petrol. Major Holmes said that the Ruler of Qatar received Es 10,000/- per annum for petrol or netrol of that value. Major Holmes compared the area of Qatar and Hawar, the latter only 30 sq. miles and the surs 1 rounding waters not included and mentioned danger from fire to a refinery at Hawar if oil produced on adjacent area. His Highness agreed to include the surrounding waters, a rough map was produced and discussed and His Highness said that 3 miles of water around Hawar on the west and all the waters between the islands would be included. His Highness explained that he had to consider the possibility of the Bahrain Petroleum Company reducing Bahrain output, at present the royalty was —-2- IV 'i was 40 lakhs per annim and he wished to guard against any reduction in revenue. The granting of another concession in Bahrain might cause the Bahrain Petroleum Company to increase import of Arabian oil. He did not want this to happen. 8. Major Holmes again spoke about about the waters (not only the waters around Hawar) and said he hoped His Highness would not decide rapidly as his company would pay a good price for this. 9. His Highness reminded Major Holmes that he granted the concession to the Bahrain Petro leum Company only after Major Holmes's company had been unwilling to take up the concession, because their geologists said there was no oil. He assured Major Holmes that he would not decide about waters before letting him know. 10. Major Holmes suggested that His Highness should state what he wanted for Hawar, pay ment and terms, but the suggestion was not acted upon. 11. The Shaikhs again explained that they wished to avoid any loss of revenue which might result from the Bahrain Petroleum Company reducing output. The minimum royalty in the present concession (Es 150,000/-) was mentioned. 12. Major Holmes referred to this as a threat by the Bahrain Petroleum. Company and implied that he knew what he would have done to counteract it. He said it was a simple thing and something could be done by the Adviser. 13. Shaikh Mohomed said that His Higliness was not asking Major Holmes's opinion because it was a matter in which Major Holmes could do nothing. It was a serious matter. 141 His Highness mentioned the terms of the Qatar concession and said perhaps he vrould consider similar terms for Hawar. 15. Shaikh Mohomed said though Hawar was smaller than Q,atar oil prospects were better in Hawar. 16. Major Holmes said that he did not know the Qatar terms, but Qatar area was large, he suggested similar terms to those in his company's previous offer which was for waters as well as Hawar, only initial payment to be three lakhs. The definition of commercial quantity of oil was discussed and also the annual payment^of minimum royalty. Eventually Major Holmes raised the initial payment to four lakhs.3- is 17. Shaikh Sulman pointed out that the most impor tant matter was the amount of annual payments, 18. Shaikh Mohomed* said commercial quantity should be 500 tons, there followed a discussion about the possibility of a refinery being built at Hawar in which Major Holmes said it would be impracticable to build a refinery for less than 1000 tons a day. 19. His Highness said that the Bahrain Petroleum Company offered a minimum royalty of 12§ lakhs and Petroleum Concessions Limited need not build a refinery until oil was found. The area of the oil producing land in Bahrain was compared to the area of Hawar, The commercial quantity was again discussed and eventually His Hi^diness agreed to leave it at 700 tons per day, 20. His Highness then said that he would agree to a payment of 6^ lakhs per annum for- a period of 15 years, whether oil was found or not, for the Hawar islands and three miles of waters around them. He said this was half the sum offered by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 21. Major Holmes said that he would have to submit the matter to London, he had authority to treat for all the waters and he required two months in which to deal with the matter and explain it to his board. 22. The Shaikhs said thaf Major Holmes could tele graph, the Bahrain Petroleum Company always telegraphed. There was a discussion about the time in which Major Holmes should give a reply. He agreed to telegraph at once and eventually' His.Highness said that he would consult the Political Agent about giving Major Holmes one month in which to reply. 23. Major Holmes returned to the question of the - waters and pointed out that if a larger area was obtained larger payments would be made. 24. His Highness enquired what tax Petroleum Con cessions Limited would pay on oil imported to Hawar if a refinery was made there. x There was a discussion about refineries elsewhere. Major Holmes said he thought it was generally half the royalty. Nationality of labourers also mentioned, Major Holmes said this point was covered by the draft lease. 25. Before leaving Major Holmes said that it was possible that he could arrange matters by tele gram but otherwise he would have to go to London and discuss it as also he wished to make an offer for the whole area, 26. His Highness said that he should make an offer first for Hawar, ADVISER TO THE GOVERNMENT.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department. EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL).

U^ Mr. Lewisohn called on the 17th January and saw Mr. Peel '■ and Mr * 0:1138011 again on the subject of the Bahrein Unallotted Area negotiations. Major Holmes had reported through Mr. okliros that the negotiations on 'behalf of Petroleum Concessions .Limited were making satisfactory progress, out he had stated /j ^ txiat an impression existed locally that the Sheikh was apprehensive of the attitude of His Majesty's Government if he should wish to give a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited, and that in fact the Sheikh was disposed to helieve I O that lt WaS the wish of His Majesty's Government that he should give the whole of the unallotted area to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Major Holmes had accordingly urged that to remove the Sheikh's misapprehensions, the India Office should he asked to instruct the Political Agent to inform the Sheikh that His Majesty s Government would have no objection if he were to give -f '• a con cession to Petroleum Concessions Limited. It was explained to Mr. Lewisohn that it would be difficult to take such a step, which moreover was felt to be totally unnecessary in view of the repeated intimation to His Highness of His Majesty's Government's impartial attitude in the matter. He was odd in confidence that the reports which we had received from Bahrein bore quite a different complexion, and indicated j ttlat cne l3ileiIdl was in fact influenced by a fear, inspired by y * MajOi? Holmes himself, that he would forfeit the goodwill of His Majesty's Government if he were to give the unallotted area to the American Company. Instructions had accordingly been sent quite recently to enable the Political Agent to reassure the Sheikh of His Majesty's Government's neutral attitude, and at the same time to indicate to him that His Majesty's Government would have no objection if he should wish to give a concession over at any rate part of the area to Petroleum Concessions Limited. Mr. Lewisohn desired to discuss the terms of the revly he might make to r.

With our brothers, our son and our Adviser we have had many meetings with the repre sentatives of both companies and we have heard what they have to say on all matters concerning the concession.

We do not think it is desirable to consider granting Messrs, Petroleum Concessions Limited a concession of the whole unallotted area nor over Hawar and all the seas within our territory but we were willing because it was suggested by the British Government, to consider the offer of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited for the Hawar islands. We will deal with this offer first. 4.

Major Holmes presented a written offer for the ,; nawar islands and territorial waters and showed a map on which the waters were marked. His Highness enquired whether this offer was the linal offer. Major Holmes replied in the affir mative. The amount of oil for commercial quantity and the drilling obligations were referred to and. it was explained to His Highness that these points were set down in the draft agreement, the amount of oil being 700 tons per day. Major Holmes said that his company would hope to find oil any time after the second year or after 18 mouths. In Kuwait it took two years. Two wells were drilled there, one produced oil. ' The question of free petrol for His Highness was discussed and Major Holmes suggested that a similar arrangement to that in Kuwait could be agreed on by letter. His Highness referred to the suggestion of a refinery being built at Hawar and pointed out that no ships could go near Hawar (owing to shallow waters; Major Holmes said that if oil was found everything would come, m Iraq oil was over 1000 miles from S68. # His Highness asked Major Holmes if he had ever V seen Hawar and on being told that he had not been there His Highness described Hawar as a miniature 'Jebel' (similar to Bahrain) Major Holmes said that perhaps there were comolaints on Trucial coast that the company did not £et^on with its work. Conditions there were difficult and different to those in Bahrain. In Bahrain progress could be rapid owing to the state of the country and feelings of the people. Major Holmes said he hoped the terms of his offer would be considered liberal and suitable and said he would like to know when he could get a reply. His Highness said that the offer was final but if there was any point in it for explanation he would refer to Major Holmes. He informed Major Holmes that he would give the matter his consideration and then let him know and he wished Major Holmes good luck. Adviser, Bahrain'^vernment^^^L^i^M—Memorandum for presentation to d. n. Huler at a meeting on February 6 ,h 1939 with the object of assuring H.M. that snould he grant a Concession to Petroleum Concessions Ltd., for tne hawar Group and territorial waters, the Company would give the development of the field their immediate and full attention. Your Highness, At our last meeting on the 26th January, Your Highness pointed out that cases occurred where oil companies having secured a concession did not develop the area with proper energy in the best interests of the State, Your Highness ninted that it might 'be my Company's policy to procrastinate, I am authorized by my Company to inform Your Hignness that tnis is not the intention of my Company in regard to the Hawar Area. Your Highness will realize from the terms I am offering this morning that it is to my Company's best interest that commercial production be reached at the arliest possible date, so that the large annual payments can be met from oil production in the form of royalties. Until commercial production my Company will get no return from their large outlay in annual rental payments. To meet the large sum of 6^- lakhs commencing at the 5th year, it is essential that every effort be made in the first four years to produce oil, and it is to the Company's advantage tnat production be commenced even before this. To ensure early production as far as possible, I can assure Your Highness that geological and drilling programmes will be prepared to obviate any delay, and work will be pressed forward with maximum zeal and energy. A separate subsidiary Bahrain Company will be formed to develop the oil resources of the Hawar area at an early date to a point where steady oil production can be maintained, and its operations, plans and progress can be investigated at any time by Your Highness, It is hardly necessary to bring to Your Highness's notice the immense advantages in the future of having two separate revenue producing Companies within your borders.

(ii) Copy of the written memorandum and offer put in by Major Holmes (vide paragraph 1 of (i) above), , ^ (iii) Letter dated the 6th February 1939 from His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain to myself, setting out the views held by himself and his family in regard to the final disposal of the Unallotted Area,' It will be observed that this letter is signed not only by His Highness but also by Shaikhs Mohammad bin 'Isa, Abdullah bin 'Isa and Salman bin Hamad, and by the Adviser. This is, I believe, quite unprecedented and is intended to demonstrate their recognition of the vital importance of the matter at issue. 3. Briefly the position now is as follows I. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have submitted an offer for the whole Unallotted Area, which, reduced to essentials, is s (a)A s. 44. MFP—985 S&amp;P—(M-1597)—27-11-36—10,000.-2- (a) Rs. 4 lakhs on signature; (b) Minimum Royalty on the present concession raised to Rs. 22i lakhs for 15 years if no oil is discovered in the new area, or a total of Rs. 17 lakhs annually for the same period if oil is discovered there; there after Rs. li lakhs or 3 lakhs per annum minimum royalty the latter figure being operative if oil is discovered in the new area; (c) Minimum quantity of Bahrain oil to he refined in the same period of 15 years (i) 10|000 barrels daily from the present concessional area; (ii) 12,500 barrels daily if oil is discovered in the nexv area. N.3 . (c)(i) actually denotes a guarantee of roughly 19 lakhs per annum. (d) A written statement that while no further guarantee can be given, the Company, if it obtains the new concession, has every expectation of being able to maintain the production of Bahrain oil at least at a figure approximating to the present production — assuming that the oil field is sufficiently productive. II, The Bahrain Petroleum Company have refused point blank to make an offer for less than the entire Unallotted Area. III. Petroleum Concessions Limited have submitted offers for the whole and for the various parts of the Unallotted Area Of these it is only necessary to detail the offer for the Hawar Islands, and 'the territorial waters of these Islands', as follows i- (a) Rs. 4 lakhs on signature; (b) Rs. 2 lakhs annually for 4 years; (c) Rs. Gg lakhs minimum royalty on discovery of oil in commercial quantities. ( N.B . 'Commercial uantity' is 700 tons daily, equivalent to an annual royalty of appro ximately Rs. 9 lakhs). 4. His Highness the Shaikh and his advisers, though genuinely anxious to fall in with the suggestion that Hawar should go to Petroleum Concessions Limited, have nevertheless been/--3- been compelled to consider how this would affect their financial security. They see that unless Bahrain has the incredible good fortune to possess two or more distinct oil fields below the small surface of its possessions (one of which must be located at Hawar) the net effect of granting a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited for the Hawar Islands is an Invitation to bankruptcy. They see and compare the guaranteed effect of the two offers during the next 16 years, which, after excluding the initial payment on signature (the same in both cases) is as follows (i) Petroleum Concessions Limited A guarantee of Rs. 2 lakhs for three years, after which the Company are entitled under article 19 of the draft Lease to abandon the concession on six months' notice, and would pre sumably do so in the absence of oil indications. Total effective guarantee Rs. 6 lakhs. (it) Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited A guarantee of either (a) Rs. 285 lakhs, vide 1(c)(1) above, or (b) Rs. 187J lakhs under 1(b) (b) only becomes effective in the unlikely event of production from the present Bahrain field falling to provide for (a). From these figures must be deducted the existing guaranteed minimum royalty of Rs. 1' lakhs per annum or a total of Rs. 22^ lakhs for 15 years. The total guarantee is, therefore, at least Rs. 165 lakhs and almost certainly Rs. 262; lakhs. NftB. I take no account here also of the larger offers dependent on the discovery of oil in the Unallotted Area. The fantastic difference between the guaranteed effect in the two cases is due to the simple fact that the Bahrain Petro leum Company possess an oil field already in production, whereas Petroleum/--4- Petroleum Concessions Limited are offering for an unexplored area. 5. It may be acknowledged that the acceptance of Petroleum Concessions Limited's offer for Hawar would probably not result in the Bahrain Government forfeiting (for immediate purposes) the whole of the sums guaranteed by the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany' s offer; for the American Company are unlikely to reduce production to the existing minimum royalty figure, even though under the terms of their concession they possess the undeniable right to do so. It would not, however, be surprising if they cut back to, say, an annual production of one million barrels, representing roughly Hs. 5 lakhs in royalty, as soon as Arabian production is sufficient to supply the balance of Refinery requirements. The latter prospect is no longer remote. 6. Squally it is undeniable that Bahrain will ultimately receive its full royalties on its total oil deposits. But, if Saudi Arabia is as prolific as is expected, it may be very many years before the American Company is compelled, by the mere necessity of maintaining adequate supplies of Crude Oil to the Hefinery, to resume Bahrain production on approximately the present scale. An essential factor to bear in mind, it seems to me, in relation to the two considerations stated above, is that an immediate drop in Bahrain production below the point where resultant royalties enable the State to purchase investments, represents permanent loss, i.e. in interest. That point is reached, at a rough calculation (which assumes that His Highness would in no circumstances take more than one-third of the royalties for his personal share) at Hs. 10 lakhs. 7. From the financial point of view therefore the grant of Hawar to Petroleum Concessions Limited may be nothing less than disastrous. One cannot but admire the restraint of His Highness/--5- Highneas the Shaikh's letter and marvel at the magnificent loyalty which animates it. Nevertheless I venture to suggest that it would be in the last degree impolitic to take advantage of His Highness' personal willingness thus to sacrifice the interests of Bahrain. 8. The preliminary advice which has t-en offered In respect of Hawar is presumably due to the following considerations s- (a) It is obviously desirable to support the candidature of a Company possessing considerable British representa tion both in capital and in personnel. (b) There are obvious disadvantages in an American Oil Company operating a concession granted by the Shaikh of Bahrain in an area so closely adjacent to 'atar, and particularly inasmuch as that area is under formal dispute at the moment between Bahrain and Qatar (even though there can be little genuine doubt that sovereignty rests with Bahrain). (c) There are also disadvantages in an American Company operating in close proximity to Petroleum Concessions Limited's selected field of enterprise in Qatar. (d) In the past the American Company has displayed little interest in Hawar and, as noted in paragraph 3 of your iSxpress letter No. G/337 dated the 19th June 1938, its own representative In London at one time suggested that Hawar should be granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited. L-r 9. It would seem that an adequate rejoinder exists to each of the above considerations, that is to say (a) We may do Petroleum Concessions Limited better service if we do not focus the American Company's thoughts on the possibility of damaging the former's prospects in the Oman hinterland (I think the possibilities are sufficiently obvious to need no further specification). (b) When once His Majesty's Government award Hawar to Bahrain, the Shaikh of 'atar is no longer concerned. If by any chance he were to attempt to contest the award by force he could presumably be 'dissuaded' without undue' difficulty. (c) No greater disadvantage is involved here than if Petroleum Concessions Limited had obtained a division of the Bahrain Unallotted Area — a possibility which has given His Majesty's Government no cause for mis giving. Referring also to points (b) and (c), it is to be remembered that if Petroleum Concessions Limited obtain the Hawar concession and subsequently discover oil/-oil there, the only possible line of export will toe across the Qatar Panlnsula, thus involving a new set of difficulties. (d) Any Company is presumatoly entitled to revise its outlooR toefore a final decision is taken. 10, However much weight the arguments set out in the immediately preceding paragraph may carry one way or the other, the essence of the existing situation is that the Bahrain Petroleum Company's offer is made dependent on their obtaining the entire Unallotted Area. This toeing the case, and since the details of the present negotiations must inevitably toeccme putolic property, it is scarcely too much to say that the grant of a concession for Hawar to Petro leum Concessions Limited under the advice of His Majesty's Govern ment will toe as disastrous to the prestige and position of His Majesty 1 s Government in Bahrain and in this part of the Gulf general ly as to the Shaikh and his administration. The prospects of the distant future (that is to say the fact that ultimately Bahrain will receive its full royalties on its oil deposits) carry no weight in these parts, and it requires little imagination therefore to realise the devastating effect of the almost inevitable comment, if His Majesty's Government insist on Hawar going to Petroleum Concessions Limited, 'the British have served their own interests at the cost of 1 million pounds to the Shaikh of Bahrain'. The eftect of hostile propaganda, overt and covert, which might toe toased on such a statement is incalculable. 11. In submitting the foregoing remarks I have taken no account of (a) the possibility of oil being found in the Unallotted Area, or (b) the offer which the Bahrain Government might obtain from etroleum Concessions Limited for the whole of the Unallotted Area, if, on Petroleum Concessions Limited's obtaining Hawar, the American Company persisted in their refusal to bid for the balance. I have deliberately excluded (a) since it can at the best toe no more than a remote possitoility, unjustified toy any visitole features /-\f&gt;' features such as exist in the Bahrain Jebel, the Danunam dome or the Jebel Dukhan in jatar. Hor can it be forgotten that the Bahrain Petroleum Company selected their present concession al area as the most promising part of Bahrain. Certainly that possibility could not be taJsen into serious account in assess ing the values of the present situation. Aa for (b) one can only estimate on the basis of Pet roleum Concessions Limited* s offer for the 'Leased Area Bahrain 1939°. Here there is — and can be — no greater guarantee than the comparatively minor sums payable during the period of exploration. 12. As short a time ago as June last year, it would, I believe, have been possible for the Bahrain Government to make an excellent bargain with the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited for the Unallotted Area minus Hawar, and to grant Hawar to *e^roleum Concessions Limited. The progress of this case has been attended by such radical alteration of circumstances that that possibility no longer exists. To be frank, Petroleum Concessions Limited have been gravely ill-advised in the pro secution of their cause; and for the reasons which I have stated above it is no longer possible, without incurring the gravest risk to the prosperity of Bahrain and, in direct con sequence, to the future good relations between His Majesty's Government and the Bahrain Shaikhs, to exert pressure to obtain Hawar for them. I suggest there remains only one alternative to the approval of the grant of an unrestricted concession to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited on the terms which they now offerj and that is, while allowing the Bahrain Petroleum Company to obtain a concession for the whole Unallotted Area, to insist that no operations shall be conducted in Hawar until such time as His Highness the Shaikh, acting on the advice of His Majesty's Government, may/-8-* may pronounce them unobjectionable. I do not specifically urge the latter suggestion but it may perhaps commend itself to His Majesty's Government for a variety of reasons. But in that event I beg to stress the need for His Majesty's Government to lend their aid to Bahrain by explaining as fully as they may think fit their objections to the Bahrain Petroleum Company operating at once in Hawar, and by using their Influence to ensure, in discussion with the Company's representatives in London, that there is no reduction in the minimum figures now offered either for royalty or for the Bahrain share of the refinery 'throughput'. 13. It is distasteful tob ® compelled to recommend the withdrawal of the support hitherto afforded to a partially British Company in its attempts to obtain a footing in Bahrain. Nevertheless it seems inevitable to ae that commercial advantages must yield to the over-riding interests of His Majesty's Government and of the Bahrain State.

It would seem to be neceasary, if His Majesty's Government were to approve of concession over whole of unallotted area being given to Bahrein Petroleum Company, to warn both the Sheikh and the Company that the question whether the Hawar Islands are included in the concessional area depends on whatever decision is eventually given by His Majesty's Government regarding the sovereignty over the islands, and that consequently no operations could be commenced in Hawar pending such decision. Do you agree? There is no reason to suppose that this position is not fully understood both by the Sheikh and by the two competing oil companies. In the circumstances5 however, it would seem highly desirable that an early decision should be reached on the question of sovereignty over the Hawar Islands. Please- sec my express letter of the 21st July, No. P.Z. 4968/38, Latest reference to question in the papers befor^ me occurs in paragraph 4 of your express letter of the Std November, N0.544-S of 1938, in which you stated that you wore enquiring 3% from/from the Political Agent, Bahrein, whether any reply- had 'been received from the Sheikh of Qatar, If he has not yet replied he might no- be asked to submit his reply within such further short period as you think reasonable.

You will see from these papers that the Bahrein Petroleum Company have refused to hid, except for the whole area including the Hawar Islands*' The great superiority of their offer over any that Petroleum Concessions Limited can inahe, and the realisation that, if they fail to get what they want, no guarantee against a heavy reduction of future production, and therefore of royalties, will he forthcoming, have moved the Sheilch and his advisers to propose to give the whole of the additional area to the purely American Company. The Political Agent and the Political Resident recommend compliance with the Sheikh's wishes. 2. We shall he glad of your views. Subject to these it seems to us that in the circumstances it will he 'best to accept the Sheikh's proposals, subject however to a caveat as to the sovereigity over the Hawar Islands, which as you know has not yet 'been decided.

The matter was discussed and the notes on previous negotiations were examined. His Highness and the other Shaikhs are of one opinion on the matter. His Highness asks me to inform you that he does not wish to consider any new offer from Major Holmes, or any other party, for the whole or part of the un allotted area.

After a fortnight's delay he came to me and said that he wished to place before His Highness an offer for what he calls the 'waters'. He argued that during the previous negotiations His Highness had told hi® more than once that he would have en opportunity to make an offer for the waters after the offer for the Hawar Islands had oeen submitted and considered. In point of fact it is argu able that this is true, but certainly everyone here thought that ax uar olmes had put in his final offer for Hawar he had finished.

I decided not to do so for three main reasons (a) It might have been misrepresented by Holmes that I personally was obstructing him.

Packer, Mr. Ashre.f (Secretary to Major Holmes). After the usual exchange of courtesies ; M .H. after asking H.H's permission presented the Draj. t Agreement for the Shoal Area, an explanatory memorandum, and a separate Arabic translation of Article 23. Copies of the memorandum and Article 23 were also distributed to Shaikh Mohammed, Shaikh Sulman and Mr. Belgrave for perusal. H.H. H.H. accepted the draft accompanying memoranda and pointed out that he could not discuss them or say anything in the matter until a reply came from London on the Hawar question &amp; it was settled. H.H. said if M.H. was going hom e he could perhaps expedite matters in London, and that he H.H. was ten times more anxious even than M.H. for the reply from the British Government. M * H * U.,E. pointed out that should a reply come after he had left for London the completion of the Hawai? question as far as the Company was concerned could be settled by Mr Packer. H.H. agreed that this was satisfactory to him. M.H. M.H. emphasized his Company's wish to make the Hawar Concession payments as soon as a reply was received from London. H.H. H.H. said immediate payment was of no consequence. M.H. M.H. asked Mr. Belgrave if he could take it that H.H. was ready to discuss the Shoal Area when the Hawar question was settled. Adv ikr. Belgrave confirmed ths,t this was what H.H. intendedto convey to Major Holmes. During general conversation H .H, remarked a propos of the lack of results in Qatar that he was sure that any concession area taken up by Major Holmes would produce oil.Memo randu; Ala filgtoi«»8_t on 5 M ^4&amp;ixjC of raaiTug cTia unusual condit to submerged geological exa and dereloping methods that have to be mod on submerged s His Highness desirous of Area' with Your Mighnessf 1.

The conditions in question are as follows - (a) that the inclusion of the Hawar.

Dear Peel, In reply to your letter No. P.2.1111/39 dated March 1st, I am now able to give you the views of the Admiralty on the Sheikh of Bahrein's proposal to grant the concession for the whole of the Unallotted Area, including the Hawar Islands, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 2, Our first observation is that the financial terms offered by the Company are in substance not so generous as they may appear to be on the surface. As we understand it, the minimum annual royalty which they are offering to guarantee for the next fifteen years is only about half that already derived from present production in Bahrein, so that provided the existing oil field produces for the next fifteen years at little more than half its present rate, the Company would be able to make up its guarantee without difficulty, on the existing field. As no additional payment is offered other than the initial l+OOjOOO rupees for the new fields, the net effect is that, leaving aside the remote possibility of the failure of their present field (when they might in any case be unable to meet their obligations) they pay nothing, beyond a small sum down, for the rights over the Unallotted Area, including the Hawar Islands. 3. we recognise that in any event the Sheikh is unlikely to be much influenced by a simple comparison of the cash offers made by the two applicants for the Unallotted Area or portions thereof, since he appears to have always in mind the, probably exaggerated, fear that the Bahrein Petroleum Company,/ T. Peel, Esq.. , M. C. , India Office, S.1.\ 0 a 3 2. Company, in the event of a rebuff, would deliberately cut down their production of oil in Bc.hrein to the existing minimum royalty figure and supply the 'balance of refinery requirements from Arabian production. Nevertheless, if you agree with the foregoing analysis of the American Company's offer, you may consider it desirable, in the Sheikh's own interest, to make quite certain, through the Resident, that he fully appreciates the position. 4. If, however, it is clear that the Sheikh has made up his mind with hxs eyes open, the Admiralty agree that he should be allowed to grant the concession for the whole area, including the Hawar Islands, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 5. 7e feel, however, that every endeavour should be made to secure the following conditions (a) That, as you suggest in your letter, a caveat should be inserted in the agreement between the Sheikh and the Company in respect to the Sovereignty of the Hawar Islands, (b) That the Company shall enter into a pre-emption agreement to the effect that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of which H.M. Government shall oe the sole judge) H.M.Government shall have the right of pre-emption of all the oil produced or refined by the Company within the Sheikhdom of Bahrein. (c) That the Company should undertake to give a guarantee to H.M. Government to refine, in time of war, a stipulated minimum quantity of crude oil to whatever specification the Admiralty should consider the most suitable for their purposes at the time. 6. We assume that the undertaking of the Company in the agreement as summarised in paragraph 3 l(c) of /eightman's express letter No. 0/91-10/1k of the 12th February, would b^ for the refining of the stipulated minimum quantity of ' Bahrein/ y f ' I1 Bahrein oil at Bahreiru lie consider that this should be made clear. 7» I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Eyres.

I am writing to say that in all the circumstances v/e agree with the views of the Foreign Office expressed in Baggallay's letter (E. 1617/196/9^) of 9th March. 3. In paragraph 3 of your letter you mention the question which was raised in Jarrett's letter of 6th December CM. 0662ij./38), of the reservation of the right to I-.C.L. to erect a refinery in Bahrein. P.C.L. have, of course, under the General Refinery Agreement an obligation to erect a refinery somewhere in the Persian Gulf if and when their production in that area reaches half-a-million tons. At the present time they hold concessions over large areas in Qatar and the Trucial Sheikdoms, and it hardly seems necessary or appropriate to try and insist that, under the Bahrein Petroleum Company's new agreement concerning the Unallotted Area, we should attempt to secure the right for P. G. L. to erect a refinery in Bahrein. The contingency of their needing to erect one there seems rather remote, 4. I have sent copies of this letter to Jarrett and jyres. Yours sincerely, (8d.) R. N.

No. 857 Dated 12th received 13th May 1939. IMPORTANT . Petroleum Concessions Limited have (gr.matd) informally that they understand statements are being made in Bahrain to the effect that Shaikh considers recent message from His Majesty's Govern ment (my Express Letter of April 25th, P.Z.2067)- - v ' means that His Majesty's Government are instructing tip, give concession for whole unallotted area to Bahrain Petroleum Company and that but for this he might still consider a different course. If suggestions are in fact being made for that His Majesty's Government have given instructions to Shaikh they are of course based on misapprehension which it would seem desirable to remove. At this end I am informing P.C.L. of fact namely Shaikh after long negotiations with two companies and careful consideration of all aspects came to conclusion that interest of Bahrain would be best served by accepting oifer of Bahrain Petroleum Company for the whole area (including Hawar ^slands). His Highness addressed a considered letter to Political Agent in this sense informing His Majesty's Government accord ingly while adding that before making final decision he/he wished to avail himself of offer of advice which at the commencement of negotiations they had said they would be prepared to offer on their conclusion. His Majesty's tiovernment on receiving this communication decided there was no reason to advise Shaikh in any way contrary to his own view arrived at after much careful consideration of his interest. They accordingly informed His a ighness that on certain conditions in regard to detail they were prepared to approve (gr.mutd) to give whole of his concession to Bahrain Petroleum Company. 3.

Belgrave, Esq # , Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Manarxa, Bahrain, I Dear Sir, | | ^ As one of the terms of my Company^ offer for the Unallotted Area, my letter of January 12, 1939 contains the following paragraph: 'During the period of one year following the date such Concession is granted, my Company will maintain at least 4 strings of tools in continuous operation within the area covered by the present Lease,' Commencing with the discovery of oil at Bahrain my Company has continuously exceeded the drilling obligations under its present Mining Lease, During the past year or longer it has maintained four to five strings of tools in operation. As a result there are now enough producing wells completed that the obligation to continue such a rapid development program over the next year would serve no useful purpose and could have no effect on the amount of oil to be produced here. On the other hand, a slower development program v /ill put my Company in a better position to space the wells properly for greater ultimate recovery and to utilize more efficiently the experience gained in drilling. Because a more normal program will not affect Bahrain^ revenue, and will be helpful to my Company in its operations. #- 2 - the Company now wishes to modify its offer of January 1939 to the extent of eliminating the obligation quoted above.

I forward herewith a copy of a letter dated the 5th JUne 1939 - ^ ^t&gt;l - from His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain forwarding a draft of the proposed agreement for the Additional Area and requesting the approval of His Majesty's Government to this draft. I have the following comments to make on the draft lease t- (a) Preamble It will be observed that the draft Is In the form of a deed fc xAx. supplemental to the original Lease of 1934 as amended by the Suonle- lS 3' -To/,f y t H, mental Agreement of the 3rd JUne 1936 relating to the establishment of the Refinery. This Is due to the anxiety of both parties to complete /- S. 6. MF P- 400S&amp;P—(M- 480)—26-7-34-2,00.000.-2- complete an agreement with the least possible delay, since an attempt to prepare at this stage a single document embodying the provisions of the original Lease, of the Refinery Agreement and of the negotiations conducted between the Bahrain Government and the Company in respect of the Additional Area would clearly involve considerable delay. Both parties contemplate that an all-embracing document of this kind shall be negotiated in due course (subject to the approval of His Majesty 1 s Government) but consider that this is a matter which can be taken up at leisure in the course of the next two or three years. With this view I am in entire agreement# Article 1 This article may have some legal significance which is not apparent to me* To my mind it is unnecessary but neverthe less unobjectionable. (c) Articles 2 and 3 Some considerable discussion has been held, and both parties have solicited my personal views, on the question of defining the area to which this Supplemental Deed shall apply. The object of both parties is to frame a lease for an area coincident with the existing and future possessions of the Shaikh of Bahrain, and the wording now used seems to provide the simplest means of achieving this object. It is to be recog nised that in existing circumstances it is not possible to define either in words or by lines on a map the present dominions of the Shaikn of Bahrain. In the first place, though there can be no substantial doubt in regard to Bahrain's rights in the Hawar group of islands. His Majesty's Government have not yet been able to declare their final decision on the dispute existing between Bahrain and Qatar in respect of these islands. Secondly a dispute exists between Bahrain and the Saudi Government in regard to the two islands. Bain al Kabir and Bain as Saghir, on-3- tooth of which Bahrain Government marks exist at the moment. Thirdly no accurate survey has yet been made of the waters, shoals and reefs on the east, south and west of Bahrain main island. While therefore it would not be impossible to define 'the present dominions', by reference to the names of islands (excluding the Hawar group and the Bainain) and 'their terri torial waters', no substantial advantage could accrue by so doing at the present stage. The wording now proposed provides for the elasticity necessary for the conduct of negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain both in respect of the substan tive dispute existing in regard to the Bainain and also for the definition of.'spheres' in the manner suggested by me separately in demi-official correspondence arising from that dispute. It provides also, by ±ta reference to 'future dominions', for the extension of the Bahrain dominions by acquisition of the sea bed in shoal waters by effective occupation in the manner . L, &lt; t adumbrated in Foreign Office Minute of the 22nd April 1938, which formed one of the enclosures to India Office letter No. P.z. 2904/38 dated the 29th April 1938 to your address. I have already indicated separately the likelihood of intensive explo ration of shoal waters in the next few years and it is clearly desirable that the present lease should be so drafted that the Bahrain State may not be deprived of the benefit of such explo ration conducted by its client, the Bahrain Petroleum Company. In short, since - as the result of last year's negotiations - the Bahrain Government are in treaty with a single company for a lease covering the whole of the Bahrain dominions whatever they may be during the next 55 years, I suggest that the present definition is adequate. (d) Article 4 requires little comment. The wording of sub-paragraph (a) does, it is true, serve to extend the term of the original Lease /-—4B** Lease since the period of 55 years counting from the date of the new Deed relates to the Company 1 s rights within the whole of the Shaikh's present and future dominions? but since the normal lease period is 75 years, I do not see that any objection need be taken on this score. It will be observed that in sub-paragraph (b) the non exclusive rights granted to the Company are now to include 'radio and other facilities and apparatus of all kinds ••••• except that radio equipment may not be used to transmit messages beyond the limits of the concession. B Since the sister company in Arabia has a similar right it seems unreason able to refuse it in the Bahrain lease, and the prohibition on radio transmission beyond the limits of the concession serves to protect the interests of Cable and Wireless Limited. Sub-paragraph (d) again seems to me to be totally un necessary but unobjectionable. (e) Article 5 In this article it will be observed no provision is made for maintaining a fixed number of 'strings of tools' 1 in operation either in the present concession or in the Additional Area, Such an obligation was definitely included in the offer made in Mr. Davies* letter of the 12th January 1939 to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, a copy of which formed item A' 111 2 of the correspondence forwarded with my Express letter No, C/51 dated the 19th January 1939. It appears however that shortly afterwards the Company withdrew this particular part of its offer in a letter of the 6th February 1939 of which I now enclose a copy. By an oversight on the part both of the Company and of the Bahrain Government no copy of this letter . P- was forwarded to me at that time and I have only now received this in response to an enquiry. I mention this point merely in elucidation, since I feel convinced that an obligation to maintain /--5- maintain a fixed number of drills in operation can confer no substantial benefit on the Bahrain Government in ensuring that the Company pursues its operations in accordance with good oil field practice; and I have ascertained that the Bahrain Govern ment do in fact appreciate this point. (f) Articles 6 and 7 provide for the revised minimum royalty figures as negotiated between the Company and the Bahrain Government, and require no comment, (g) Article 8 also follows the agreement provisionally reached between the parties in their recent negotiations. (h) Article 9 equally reproduces an item in the negotiations already held, but requires some comment. It appears that by local agreement between the Bahrain Government and the Company a considerable part of the gas produced during the refining pro cess, which is in fact used in the furnaces in the Refinery, is converted by mathematical formula into an equivalent amount of oil fhel which, in accordance with the original Lease and the subsequent Refinery Agreement, may be deducted from the royalty paying total of crude oil as 'oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installations'. This of course is a reasonable and economic arrangement to which no objection can be taken; but viewing it in relation to an article prescribing that one half of the oil processed in the Refinery up to a total Refinery throughput of 20,000 (or 25,000) barrels daily shall be Bahrain crude, it may conceivably be held that it subjects that share to proportional deduction. On a rough calculation this would cause a deduction of 6 per cent, and it was certainly never intended that the Bahrain share of the Refinery throughput should be subjected to any such /-0t« -6- such reduction. So far as I am aware the working arrangement between the Government and the Company, to vuhich I have referred above, cannot legally be described as an essential part of the original lease or the Refinery Agreement and consequently the Company could not claim a legal right to a deduction on this score. If this view is correct then I see no need to vary the wording of Article 9. If however a reasonable doubt exists then I suggest that that doubt might be resolved by inserting the words 'royalty paying* before the word 'oil* in line 12 of the English part of this article. There is little doubt that such an insertion would be accepted by the Company, though in return they might propose a second variation in the article by which, in place of the existing stipulation, it would be provided that not less than one half of the amount of oil processed in the Refinery, up to a total of 20,000 (or 25,000) barrels daily, shall be produced in the Shaikh's present and future dominions* The effect of this would be that while the Shaikh's royalty rights under the article would be preserved, the Company would be enabled to vary the proportions of Saudi and Bahrain oil being processed in the Refinery as might suit them best seasonally. It has, for example, been explained to me that the Arabian crude produces twice as much first grade kerosene as does the Bahrain crude and almost twice the quantity of diesel oil, while on the other hand the Bahrain crude pro duces a greater proportion of petrol. In view of the heavy seasonal demands of certain Eastern countries for kerosene the Company might at times wish, by increasing the Arabian pro portion of the throughput, to accumulate greater kerosene stocks than they could do economically if tied to a fixed daily pro portion of Bahrain oil passing through the Refinery? at such times the major part of Bahrain production would be exported in the form of crude. At other times the process might be reversed /-reversed when petrol stocks required to be built up. Any rights conferred on His Majesty's Government by a pre-emption schedule in a separate Political Agreement would not of course be affectedj nor need It be apprehended that such a proposal would indicate an intention on the part of the Company to reduce Bahrain product' ' the minima negotiated, since in a letter of the 5th June 1939 Mr, Thornburg, on behalf of the Company, repeats the assurance given last January that while the Company cannot actually guarantee more than the minima negotiated it has every expectation of being able to maintain Bahrain production at a figure approximating to present production, I enclose a copy of this letter herewith, I trust that this explanation is sufficiently clear for appreciation of the points Involved. (1) Article 10 requires no comment and is unobjectionable. Political Agent, Bahrain,v' INDIA OFFICE ? milTEKaLL, S.¥. 1.

On a preliminary examinatipn we do not like his method of dealing with the area to 'be covered by the new concession. V/e have ot received a copy of the map intended to accompany the concession, but we gather that it would exclude from the Sheikh's 'present 11 possessions islands or reefs to which the Saudi Arabian Government or the Sheikh of Qatar has already made, or may make claim. The Sheikh of Bahrein would hardly welcome this distinction between his 'present' and his 'future' possessions. It should be possible to devise some more satisfactory definition and we have made a suggestion for this purpose in the enclosed amended copy of the draft. ¥e have also added an article as suggested in your/ S F.

Z. 2067/39. 3,0th May, 1939. Dear Baggallay, € $ r ith reference to your letter of the 9th March, No. E. 1617/1 96/91 , regarding the Bahrein Unallotted. Area, I enclose for your comments a provisional draft for an agreement between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and His Majesty's Government. le have had a preliminary talk with Ballantyne on this subject. v ?e understand that though the Company will in the first place negotiate a separate agreement with the Sheikh- covering the unallotted area only it may be their 4 intention eventually to have a consolidated concession agreement which would apply to the whole territory. In any case it is of course our intention that the political agreement and its accompanying schedule should apply to the whole area covered by the Company's concessions. 2. Articles 2, 1+ and 6 of the draft are based on provisions of the 1934 Agreement between the Company, and the Sheikh. It seems desirable to have them reaffirmed in an agreement with His Majesty's Government. Article 5 -v. corresponds to the similar provision in the Debai and Sharjah Political/ H. L. Baggallay, Esq. , Foreign Office, S. W. 1.2. Political Agreementsj as we understand that the Company are not altogether satisfied with the terms of Article XVI of their 193U Agreement. We think however that the local authorities will have to 'be asked what provisions are considered essential in this Article in the light of their experience. The remaining Articles and the Schedule are 'based on provisions in the political agreements relating to Koweit, Qatar, etc, V/e have, however, tentatively added a proviso to the usual form of Article 8 and should be glad to know whether the Admiralty think the addition desirable. The views of the local authorities on this article may also be required. The preamble and first Article allow for signature before the new concession is signed and can be amended if the concession is signed first. 3. You will see that we have included as Article i'1 the penalty of termination of the Concession Agreement by the Sheikh, for any breach of the Political agreement. We had supposed that this trilateral arrangement which has been used elsewhere would not be possible in the present case, where part of the concessional area has already been fully developed without the Company being a party to any such arrangement. But we found that Ballantyne himself rather expected/ox 3. expected that some such arrangement would be stipulated by us? and we therefore propose to try to get it accepted by the Company and the Sheikh. T enclose a copy of a letter we are sending him in this connexion. With regard to the enclosure to this letter? we think it desirable to omit in this case the provision for the surrender of the Company's properties to the Sheikh in the event of termination of the lease which has been embodied in the correspondence relating to other concessions in the Persian Gulf. It would perhaps be asking rather much of the Company to expect it to agree to this, and the termination of the Concession agreement should afford a quite sufficient penalty by itself. li. ¥e should be glad to have your comments at an early date. I am writing similarly to Starling and Jarrett. Yours sincerely,P. 3. 2067/39. This Agreement dated, the day of One Thousand nine hundred and thirty -nine is made 'between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom (hereinafter called 'His Majesty's G-overnment') of the one part and the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited (hereinafter called 'the Company.' which expression shall where the context so admits be deemed to include its successors and/or assignees and shall also be deemed to include any subsidiary Company) of the other part.

Confidential . Dear Mr. Ballantyne, In the course of the discussion here on the 9th May regarding the nature of the agreement which His Majesty's G-overnment would propose to enter into with the Bahrein Petroleum Company some reference was made to the procedure by which the'Sheikh would take cognisance of it and provide the necessary 'sanction' for any 'breach of its provisions. Perhaps I might explain in more detail the nature of the procedure which we have in mind and which has been followed in other similar cases, as you may wish to have the information as early as possible. 2. Ihen the agreement between the Company and His Majesty's t Government is being negotiated the Company v/ould be invited to express their willingness to. agree to the arrangements set out in the enclosure hereto. Upon their doing so, and concluding the agreement with His Majesty's Government, the Sheikh would be given a copy of the agreement, informed of the/ . R. Ballantyne, iJsq. , 11, Birchin Lane, E.C.3.2. the underatandiiTgreached with the Company (as descrihed in the enclosure), and asked to state in writing that he understands these arrangements and agrees to them. On receipt of his reply the Company would he asked formally to signify their acceptance of the arrangements and thereupon His Majesty s Government would intimate to the Company and to the bheikh their approval of the Company's concession. To complete the picture, the arbitration provisions of the concession, agreement are formally made applicable to any case of termination of the concession hy the Sheikh under the arrangements described above, as you will see from Article 11 of the enclosed revised provisional draft. 3. ye now propose to consult the interested Departments upon this draft, and hope to be able to address you at an early date. You will note that some amendments have been made in articles 8 and 9 and a more extensive amendment in Article 5, which is now in the form most recently used. Yours sihcerely.EI-TCL03URE.

(b) If the Company should fail to observe any of the terms of the agreement between the Company and His Majesty s Government signed in London on the alleged failure having been disputed by the Company, the matter has.been referred to arbitration under Article of the Company's Agreement with the Sheikh (which is made applicable to the case by Article 11 of the agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government) and the Company should not remedy such failure within the reasonable time which should be fixed by the arbitrators for so doing then the Company agrees that the Sheikh will be entitled to terminate the agreement between the Company and himself.Co nfi d e ntlal • OOVIRNMENT OP INDIA, Department. express lette: {N* B, This is an ORIGINAL MIHSSAGJE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to he treated^ on receipt^ with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

In the course of examining the draft agreement, it has occurred to me that a major obstruction may arise owing to the existence of sales contracts already entered into by the Company for long periods ahead. ( I have not, of course, made any attempt locally to ascertain what contracts they now have). Such contracts might contain 'force majeure' clauses tu cover non-performance owing to war, but such clauses could not, I imagine, be stretched legally to cover a subsequent agreement with His Majesty's Govern ment by which the latter may pre-empt In war-time. If this is so, it will become necessary to approach the problem from a totally different angle — in other words His Majesty's Government mus + m.p-4003&amp;p (h 480 26-7-34-2,u),joo. first/. 2 - 'O 0 first acquire a legal right from the Ruler of Bahrain to take over (in effect) in war time all Bahrain products deacribable as 'war material'. I am not quite sure what the legal procedure would be, or whether a subsequent formal Political Agreement with the Company would be necessary. Possibly only 1 an understanding would be necessary — that Kis Majesty 's Government on their side wculd pay fair prices and/or compensation, and the Company on their side would work their concession and Refinery Agreement to capacity limits. 3. If, however, a Political Agreement is still necessary, X have the following comments to make on the present draft. Freemble and ArtieIs 1 . Since the draft concession for the Additional Area has already been submitted to His Majesty's Government for approval and is likely to be signed before — or simultaneously with — the Political Agreement, the Preamble and Article 1 will presumably be amended as contemplated in the last sentence of paragraph 2 of India Office letter No .P. Z. 2067/39, dated 'the 3rd May 1939. Article 2 . I suggest there are considerable disadvantages in canalising all communications between Ris Majesty's Government and the Company. In existing practice communication on many ' i \ subjects of mutual importance to His Majesty's Government and i ' the Company is initiated between the Company's Chief Local Representative and the Pcjitical Agent in Bahrain. This possesses the'advantage that His Majesty' s Government can receive, in the initial stages of any ouch discussion, a report basod on local knowledge (c♦ f 1 • comir .ervtn under A rticlo B below)# . I suggest therefore that the Article be redrafted to allow communication In Bahrain . | Articles 3 and 4. I 1 ■ 1 ' ' No comments. , Article 5 ./ i \Article 5 . In point of fact a great deal of routine and unimportant work is already disposed of in direct communication between the Company and, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. I see no need for any special reservations to be made in this Article. The Political Agent knows everything that goes on, and if he were to find that too liberal an interpretation were taken of the words 'routine or unimportant matters' it would be his business to st^p i J *\.and rectify matters. Articlos 6 and 7 . No ceminent. Article 3 . The addition to the normal form of this Article is presumably due to an (inaccurate) suggestion by iir. Ballantyne that His Majesty's Ships use the Company's harbours free of charge. In point of fact the Company has no harbour approach able by any but shallow draft boats and barges. The addition therefore bestows no benefit. Articles 9. 10 and 11 and the schedule . No cofflflient Political Agent, Bahrain. / /JTelegram 'Q' From Political Agent, Bahrain.
