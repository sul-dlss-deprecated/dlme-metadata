Her claim is against her husband’s former business partner Seth Kishinchand (also spelt Kishandas) Nathamal, merchant of Dubai, regarding her entitlement to rental income from a jointly owned property in Dubai. The correspondence contains three petitions from Manibai, together with a copy of an agreement made at Karachi in 1933 between her son Chaturbhujdas (also spelt Chaturbhuj) Dhamanmal and Seth Kishinchand Nathamal, which contains the terms of a new lease for the property. Also included in the file are two letters from Seth Kishinchand Nathamal to Chaturbhujdas Dhamanmal at Karachi and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire respectively. There are other letters, in both English and Arabic, from the Residency Agent at Sharjah who was charged with investigating the claim, to the Political Agent at Bahrain and also to a committee of local merchants. The committee’s valuation of the property, in Arabic, is also present in the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000262#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000262#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
