WHS/GAL Ref. 23 November 10th, 1943 Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Persian Gulf Residency, Biishire. Dear Sir Geoffrey y your letter of October I have been greatly interested by 27th, which I found here on my arrival from England. I, personally, am wholly in favour of building a Church in Manama as soon as possible ana am most grateful to you for bringing the question to a head, as ^ell as your offer of the windows - a subject in which I happen to have long taken an interest. hope you will realise that it is in no sense because I am not anxious to go ahead, but because I want to clear the ground as far as possible before we start. i) Since you write from Bahrain, I presume you have discussed it with Belgrave. He told me a year or sj ago that he had no doubt that the Sheikh would be prepared to give us land for the purpose when the time was ripe, but he did not then think it was, because we had not the money. Would the launching of your appeal meet his point ? ii) In general, has the idea been adequately canvassed among the local community, and are they in favour ? (if it has not I am qui^e prepared to do some canvassing myself when next I find time to go there.) iii) Naturally I should welcome a grant from the Oil Company, but I have always understood that it was very doubtful whether they would give one (even for Awali) unless someone could get at Max Thornberg, who is the most sympathetic among their chief men. We should, I think, have to be very careful not to let Manama Church appear in any way as an opposition camp to Awali, or a division of the already weak forces of the Church in the Island. On tne other hand, I think there is an overwhelming • v. If, therefore, I raise a few points and queries first, I1 ^' 2 . case for asking the Company to contribute very substantially to the maintenance of a Padre who would be responsible for both, though in view of the small proportion of* Anglicans in Awali tne Church Room there must obviously remain available for 'other denominations.' Similarly I think we should try to enlist the sympathy of the American Mission. They are rightly held in very high esteem, and I should not wish to appear in any way discourteous to t them, or seem to be trying to cut them out. I do not know enough of the present situation in regard to the Services and Service Chaplains. Are there perhaps enough of these to justify a building now (if it can be done), while postponing, as I fear we must for lack of men, the appointment of a civil Chaplain till after the war ? It may be two years or more after the war before the supply begins to meet the demand. The suggestion of combining a Chaplain and schoolmaster sounds admirable, as I know how difficult tne education question is. It might also open up the possibility of some help from the British Council. But it would increase the difficulty of finding the man, and would in my view make it very desirable that the Chaplain should be a married man, thereby raising an additional question of house accommodation. Meanwhile I am sending copies of this correspondence to my Finance Committee in London, to see if they are prepared to make a grant.

Rather to my surprise, they both of them responded rather warmly to the idea of a church in Manama, and said that they had no doubt that the Company would contri bute in the same way as they had done to the Roman Catholic church there, but on a larger scale, since they had more 'Protestant' employees. They also said that were such a church built, the Company would provide transport to take their employees down to church in Manama. This, however, suggested to me a less favour able aspect of the matter, namely, that were such a church to be built, the Company might proceed to withdraw their permission (hitherto renewed year by year) for the use of the children’s re creation room in Awali, which is now fitted up as a quite reason ably adequate church, and has recently been much improved by the voluntary labour of the R.E# This would be a disaster in itself, and would break the heart of Norman Dodds, our licenced lay-reader in the Island, who has done gallant work for some eight years in the Awali Camp where he himself lives. A more encouraging aspect of the matter was that the two American heads of the Company both appreciated the fact that a » church in Manama would be open to all Christians of all races whereas if we were to suggest building in Awali, the question of racial bar might very probably come up and prove an awkward bone of contention. I was glad to hear that they them- ^ selves both desired to let pny sense of colour bar die quietly (as indeed I think it is actually doing), and to avoid any pre— mature discussion such as might hinder the process of its death, I myself expressed the view strongly that there was need for churches in both places, and that while I did not feel we had any real case to ask the Company as such to help financially with a building in Manama, I should very much like to see them later on ► U&gt; support a chaplain who would serve both churches, and who perhaps ought to live in Awali. * i Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E, The Residency, BUSHIRE, Persian Gulf.I also discussed the matter with the American missionaries in Manama, Mr Van Peursen and Dr Harrison. Both expressed them selves as having no objection whatever to our building in Manama, and I have since received a particularly charming letter from Dr Harrison, written after consultation with his fellow-missionaries, in which he goes much further and warmly supports the suggestion. He appears to think that such a church would be able to minister (in English) not only to the British community but also to the Indian Christians, and would further release him and his colleagues to pursue their more specifically missionary work among the Arabs and in Arabic. Naturally, I talked it over also with Belgrave, and with Norman Dodds. Belgrave is, I think, quite willing to take ac tion, though he feels, and in this I strongly support him, that the matter should be regularly discussed with the Church Council, which, with Dodds as lay—reader, is the only organized machinery that the Bishopric has in the Island. I think also he feels, as I do myself, that any collection of funds in the Island should be done by the Church Council itself. At the same time, they would be only too grateful to you if you would undertake to get what help you could at home, or from past residents in the Gulf who might be interested and would be reassured by knowing that the scheme had your blessing and backing. Dodds, I think, feels himself in rather a difficult position. ^•He was much more sanguine than Belgrave and others as to his ability to collect money from the Awali community, whom, after all, he knows better than most from the inside, and to whom, for 350 or more days in the year, he has been the only Anglican minister of religion available. But I think he would be seriously distres sed, and rightly, if he felt that the centre of gravity of the churchmanship of Awali were to be shifted to Manama, and I am sure he is right in thinking that an occasional bus to a church twelve --miles away could not really take the place of a church room in their midst, even though the latter may be a less worthy building. The R.A.P. are at present adequately served by their own Chaplains, who indeed are giving the civil community more services than they have ever had before. Belgrave told me that this was the first year on record when they had had opportunities of making their Communion on Christmas, Easter and Ascension Days. At the same time, my experience elsewhere suggests that a civil church in Manama would probably be very welcome to and considerably used by Service personnel, even if they had their own chapel at Muharrak. (At the moment they are using the ante-room to an N.C.O^ can teen, and even if they do get a chapel, I doubt if they will have a resident chaplain after the war.)9^h October, 1944 Will you please refer to your letter of May 31st which I was very glad to get* I certainly agree with your conclusions, find am convinced that we could and should not only continue the Church Room at Awali but also provide for a Church for Manana* I am going over to Bahrain shortly and will consult Belgrave and Dodds and the Church Council and concert a plan* The amount we should aim at collecting is about Rs. 100,000.

I find, however, that there is a genuine apprehension that if this was constructed the Bahrain Petroleum Company would withdraw the facilities which they now grant at Awall, and I cannot make any headway until these fears are allayed. You were good enough to say that the apprehensions were unfounded and that the position would not be affected by the construction of a church in Manama.

Dear Sir Geoffrey, i. 3 In answer to your letter No. C/474 of 11th November, 1944, I can not guarantee that the present facilities used by the Awali Church Committee will be reserved for their use indefinitely. These present facilities consist of a small building built originally as a children’s playroom in conjunction with the adjacent school, and permission to use the building as a church is granted on a year to year basis. If and when it is necessary to use this building for its original or other purpose, another meeting place might be arranged if there is sufficient demand for such. Such latter facil ities offered by the Company may not, however, be in the form of a proper Church reserved exclusively for use as such. The building of a church in Manama will have no direct bearing on any arrangements made one way or the other in Awali, and it is not the intention of the Company to withdraw the present facilities because of this. Hence objections to the building of a church in Manama on these grounds are not justified. I might also add that such objections appear to be a bit unfair to those who desire and need a church in Manama. I wish to state at this time that the Company will welcome the establishment of a church in Manama and will be pleased to give assistance to such a project.

The word ’Episcopalian* has been inserted to make the object of the appeal clearer to Americans who are more familiar with this term. 2. The intention is to issue a separate appeal outside the Islands and to have for this purpose an expanded committee which will probably be‘ called the Bahrain Church Appeal Committee. The b^nior ft&amp;val Officer has very kindly agreed to Join it and I am writing to ask General Sir Arthur Smith, and Belgrave is writing to Mr. Thornburgh who was formerly a director of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and took a great interest in church matters. 3. In discussion with Dodds it was agreed that Belgrave might appropriately be chairman of the expanded committee — his and his wife’s families have innumerable connections at home, and his position as Adviser to the Government will be helpful — and I shall make their appeal the basis of anything I do in England. I hope to get home next Spring and would like to consult your Finance Committee before making any move.

POLITICALi I * Qfl The need for an Anglican Church in Bahrain has long been felt and it has been decided, with the approval and support of the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem, that an appeal should be made with this object. A local appeal has been made and a sum of Rs. has been collected out of the estimated cost of Rs.100,000 (£ 7000). The Anglican community in Bahrain is not large but is. likely to grow considerably in the next few years. Apart from Service men, it includes now British officials, business men, Oil Company staff, British and Americans and Indian Christians. The • great majority are not permanently resident in the islands but their response to the appeal has been very generous: they look forward to a congregation rising in a short time to some two hundred. It is doubtful, however, if any further contributions can be expected locally, but it has long been the practice of the Church to extend a helping hand to their fellow Churchmen overseas, and we therefore appeal confidently to the members of the Anglican community as a whole to contribute to our Fund. mi £The War has been an exceptionally trying time for the Persian Gulf and of these troubles Bahrain has had its full share. Cut off from the main body of their countrymen in the Middle East and India 9 and at one time with no troops between them and the Germans in Iraq, the British, American and Indian Community spent many anxious days, culminating in the Italian raid on the Bahrain Refinery, when an appalling disaster was avoided by the narrowest of margins. This Community, which has rendered invaluable services to the Allied Cause, now wishes to erect an Anglican Church. A surprisingly large amount of money has been collected locallybut for the balance they rely on their fellow Churchmen elsewhere. The appeal has the support of the naval, military and air authorities and of the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem and I commend it to Churchmen throughout the world.

On September 9th I held a meeting of the few members of the committee who were in Bahrain and also invited representatives of the British firms in Bahrain, who had contributed generously to the fund, to attend. After a long discussion it was decided that it was not advisable to commence building at present and therefore the fund should be invested in stock to be recom mended by the Manager of the -Eastern Bank, who was present at the meeting. Some people expressed the view that a church without a resident chaplain would be of little use and it would be bettor to obtain a chaplain and then to build a church. It was generally considered that when plans were made for the church building a simple building should be designed. The rough plan which had been prepared by Mr. Sharp, Civil Chaplain in Persia, was shown to the people who attended the meeting. Most of them did not consider that such a type of building was suitable or possible with the funds available. In November the fund was invested in 3-*$ war stock. Lieut. Colonel A.C.

NS.© The Residency, Sibi, February 5 , 1947. Many thanks for your demi-official letter No.C/1385 of the 15th of December 1946 regarding the Bahrain Church Fund. The decision of the Church Committee is very disappointing and I entirely agree with you that at least they should use some of the funds in securing a Chaplain without delay. It is quite possible to hold the Services in existing conditions for some time to come, but without a Chaplain Bahrain is entirely dependent on sporadic visits from outside parsons. I feel sure that it would be in the Interest of Church work in Bahrain to secure a Clergyman as soon as-possible. Would you very kindly let Belgrave know my views? Lieut: Col: A.C.Galloway, CIE.,OBE, Political Agent Bahrain, (Persian Gulf). Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT.The 9th of March, 1947. (5QJ My dear Belgrave, Will you please refer to my demi-official I letter No.c/1386 dated the 16th December, 1946? 2. i wrote to prior the other day to keep him informed of the progress of a project with which he was so closely allied. I send you a copy of his reply, 3. With reference to acquiring the services of a chaplain, has any advance been made in the matter? I understood from White that you were expecting a visit from the Bishop and proposed further to discuss matters with him. Incidentally, White has been broadcasting suggestions with a view to appropriating the Chaplain for a Seamen's Mission. yours sincerely. C.D.. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., • Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. mjGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D.O. No. 1TZ6-.//? Adviserate, March 10, 1947 Regarding your D.O. No. C/328 dated 9th March 1947, on the subject of Church affairs, the Bishop was expected here early next week but now I am doubtful about his coming owing to the difficulty over air transport, it will be unfortunate if he does not come TininK/_ixi is more important to have a Chaplain than a Church. From information which I have received recently I believe that one would have to pay a Chaplain something in the neighbourhood of £900 per annum as well as providing a furnished house and a car. I have not taken into consideration the cost of passages. 3. You and Prior consider that we should be justified in spending some of the money which was contributed for the purpose of building a Church on a Chaplain^ stipend. This I feel is a matter for the Bishop to decide and if he does not come here within the next few days I will write to him and ask for a ruling on the matter. Without obtaining his approval I think it would be wrong to use money which was collected for building a Church for any other purpose. One cannot secure a Chaplain without guaranteeing his salary for a definite period, say two, or three years. The Chaplain in Babra does a three years* tour. 2 / Confidential. BAHRAIN Dite3/ 2 4. If the Bishop approves of a Chaplain being paid from the building fund the difficulty of financing him will be solved, if he does not approve of this step it will be necessary to find the money to pay a Chaplain, Without a definite guarantee of a fixed salary for a specified period no Chaplain would come here. 5. In Basra the Seamen’s Mission pays about half the Chaplain’s stipend and also provides a car for him. In Bahrain there is a need for someone to deal with the merchant seamen. I think if a Chaplain could be provided by the Seamen’s Mission he could look after the seamen and also undertake the duties of a civil Chaplain, in this case we might expect half of his salary to be paid by the Mission. I believe that £100. per annum might be contributed from Jerusalem. This would leave £350 per annum to be guaranteed from local .sources, though it may sound a small amount^in a place with such a changing population as Bahrain it will not be easy to obtain guarantees for the payment of this sum for supporting an Anglican clergyman. If no financial support was available from the Mission to seamen, or any similar organisation, I believe it will be impossible to find the money which is required. 6 . Then there is the question of a housej rooms suitable for a European in local buildings are expensive to rent, very indifferent accommodation costs not less than £180. per annum. A four-roomed house with kitchen and usual offices such as we are building on the edge of the Municipal garden will cost today about Rs.30,000.7. Regarding the Church Itself; in my opinion it would now be possible, with the money which we have, to build a simple adequate Church. Such a Church would be very different from the type of building visualised by Prior who thought of a Church after the style of the very beautiful buildings which have been constructed in Persia by sharp of the C.M.S. 8 . As far as services in Bahrain, during the past few months wehavebeen fairly well provided for, Bahrain has'^been(frequently?visited by the R.A.F. Chaplain also by White from Basra and now by Wilson, the I.P.c. Chaplain, who is shortly taking on a curate so that either he or the curate will be visiting Bahrain farwquentiy. x know that visiting priests cannot do regular Church work in Bahrain and I appreciate the fact that a permanent Chaplain is required. 9. X have recently discussed the question of a Chaplain with Russell Brown and he told me that the Company was not prepared to contribute towards an Anglican Chaplain because if they assisted one sect they would have to support ministers of other sects as well and this was contrary to Company policy.

Yours sincerely. C.D. Belgrave, Rsq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.D. 0# No. 7//'//? Adviserate, March 23, 1947. Referring to your D.O. No. C/365 dated 18th March 1947, the amount already collected for the Church Building Fund is Rs. 66,249-6-0. 2. The Bishop decided that the funds collected for building a church should not be used for paying a chaplain. He considfed that a chaplain should be obtained before building was commenced. Before a chaplain could be appointed there must be a guarantee of a fixed sum per annum to proved*the chaplain’s stipend and expenses, such as house rent, transport, passages etc. These costs would amount to about £1,200/- per annum, including provison for the upkeep of the church when built. 3. The Bishop approached the heads of several of the British firms in Manama and discussed the matter with Russell Brown. The responses were on the whole satisfactory, most people agreed that it was desirable that there should be a chaplain in Bahrain. The Managers of firms stated that they would recommend their principals to give support if the other firms did the same. No figures were discussed except with Bapco and in their case the sum of £500/- per annum was mentioned. The Bishop hopes to obtain financial help from the R.A.F., Mission to Seamen and the India or Foreign Office. 2 /— Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. ^2 (a&gt; U^ 4. The Bishop does not wish anything to be done until he has got in touch with the Chaplain General regarding the R.A.F. and with other authorities in England. He is then going to write a letter to me asking me to hold a meeting at which a statement from him will be read. I think his proposal will be that a certain sum must be guaranteed from the British firms in Bahrain and he will invite them to consider in what proportion the sum should be divided among them, the remainder will have to be made up from annual subscriptions from people here who are prepared to pay and from church collections. 5.

Matchett, Civil Chaplain, Basrah, and the Persian Gulf, and Port Chaplain, missions to ■ Seamen, came to see me this morning, and discussed, amongst other things, the question of a Resident Chaplain in Bahrain. ,1 said that my latest information was that given in Mr. Belgrave’s letter to me of March 23rd (sl.34),°and that the Bishop’s statement (para. 4 of si.34) is still awaited. Mr. Matchett told me that he, too, had no later information than mine. He also said that he did not think the Missiortfto Seamen would be prepared to open a mission here or bear the cost of part of the Chaplain's pay, as Seamen’s missions were more urgently needed elsewhere, e.^. in Bandarshahpur where cargo ships tie alongside for several weeks at a time, and there are no amenities of any sort for their crews. In his view the needs of tankers’ crews, who comprise most of the seamen coming to Bahrain do not compare with those oi the crews of ordinary cargo vessels, as their turn-round is so rapid, usually not more than 24 hours. Mr. Matchett said he would be writing to the Bishop of Jerusalem soon to find out what progress, if any, the latter had made over the question of getting a c/E Chaplain for Bahrain, and Mr. Matchett promised to let me know the Bishop’s reply.
