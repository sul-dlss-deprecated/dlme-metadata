The charge for repetition, which must be paid when the telegram is handed in, is one half the ordinary tariff. Telegrams containing mercantile quotations or figures, and telegrams written in cypher, or according to a preconcerted code, should always be repeated. No copy of a repeated telegram is given to the sender.

A few countries impose rest rictions on the use of code and cypher, and particulars of these are published in the footnotes to the Tables of Charges on pages'367 to 397. PLAIN LANGUAGE. 313. (I) Plain language is that which presents an intelligible meaning, each word and each expression having the meaning normally assigned to it in the language to which it belongs. Telegrams in plain language may be expressed in any of the principal European languages, aed certain others, including Esperanto. They must be written in the ordinary English alphabet. A single check word not exceeding ten letters in length may be written at the beginning of the text of a banker’s or similar telegram without altering its plain language character. In plain language the maximum number of letters allowed to pass at the charge for a single word is 15, any excess being charged for at the rate of 15 letters to a word. Subject to this limit, the following are counted as single words: ordinary compound words and names of towns, countries, Provinces, places, family names and names of ships written without break, names of streets, squares etc. The words ''Street” Square” etc. or their equivalents in other langua ges, can be combined with such names so as to form a single chargeable word. If joined by a hyphen, or separated by an apostrophe, such compound words or names are counted as so many separate words. Compound numbers written in words and without break are also counted as single words, subject to the same limit as to the number of letters. Words in correctly spelt, so as to bring the number of letters below the maximum, or incorrectly joined together, contrary to the usage oi tne. language, ai© inadmissible in plain language telegrams. In all telegrams the name of the office of destination in the address ' is • charged for as one word whatever its length ; and when the name of the country, state, province or district has to be added to distinguish the o lice, from others of the same name, the whole expression is charged for as one word. In all telegrams every isolated letter ot figure is charged for as a word. Groups as figures are counted at the rate of •&gt; figures o a wore, am a e some rate fo! any excess. The same method of counting is applicable to groups of letters or of letters and figures forming commercial expressions or commercial marks- that is, marks impressed on packages or bales of goods or on the goods themselves. Groups of letters in current use are similarly counted when occur.ng in the text. But such letters are not admissible i n groups in the address ° they are charged for as so many separate words Letters added to figures to represent the number of a, house are counted a figures. Ordinal numbers written in the form 17 i mnot be used ; they should be written in full as “Seventeenth”, “dixseptieme”, or “siebzehnten”. Bars of divisions, decimal points, and stops used in the formation of numbers are counted as figures ; otherwise signs of punctuation are not transmitted except at the special request of the sender, and they are then charged for as separate words. As an exception, however a bar of division in the number of a house, e. g\, dO/A, 30/bis, is not counted for the purpose of charge. CODE LANGUAGE. 2. Code Language is composed of (a) artificial words; or (b) dictionary words not used with the meaning normally assigned to them in the language to which they belong and consequently not forming intelligible phrases in one or more of the languages authorised for plain language; or (c) of a mixture of dictionary words as defined above and artificial words. Telegrams containing Code language are of two kinds, namely “Category A” in which no code word may exceed ten letters and “Category B” in which no code word may exceed five letters. Category B telegrams are subject to a reduced charge (see Section XI11.) In a Category A telegram code words, (whether dictionary words or artificial words) which are to be charged as single words must have at least twuo vowels if they contain six, seven or eight letters, and at least three vowels if they contain nine or ten letters. At least one vowel must be in the first five letters and at least one vowel in the rest of the word. The third vowel required in nine letters or ten-letter words may be in any position in the word. The vowels are a e i o u y. There is no restriction as to the number of vow T els above three which may be used, and these additional vow T els may be in any position in the word. A proper name or dictionary word used in a Category A code telegram with its ordinary meaning and not with code meaning will not be subject to these rules regarding vowels. It may exceed ten letters in length and is chargeable at the rate of ten letters to the word. A word over ten letters, used w r ith a code meaning is classed as cypher and is chargeable at the rate of 5 letters to the word. Words incorrectly spelt so as to reduce the number of letters, or incorrectly joined together, contrary to the usage of the language, are inadmissible in Category A telegrams. , code word in a Category A telegram which does not contain the minimum number of vow T els as detailed above, will be chargeable at five letters to a word, but other code words in the same telegram, which comply with the v owel rule, will be charged as single words up to the maximum of en etters. Thus a text containing 200 ten-letter words, of which one con tamed less than three vowels, would count as 201 words—that is 199 single words plus two words for the double word. It would be convenient from the telegraphic point of view if words which do not contain the minimum number of vowels were written out as five-letter words. iP 16 v °wel rule for ten-letter words will admit groups like neDgmxvwo. _ huch groups incur a greater risk of error in transmission than ^ .I vow ^ s are use d so as to produce a resemblance to dictionary S ’ ar j, 16 Public should in their own interest avoid the use of such groups as far as possible.mts, a D ist)p-; otherwise sigiir s tof thes^ij oxeepioD, bgi 50|bis, is not AGE, f (a) aricislr normally as^i; oently not foe rised for plain ove and irtifelr of two Ws, Mi ters and tat^: iry B telegrair: whether ick gle words muir t letters, aniii: least one Twd: the rest of if* letter words® uy. f vowels ata- be in any po&gt;i® ; ied in a Cate' with code affi It mayesd^ ns to the word 1' as cypher std 1 '- on-ectly spell*; other, codW- 1 - legi’amS' which does $' In a Category B telegram the code words must not in any case exceed five letters m length and are chargeable as single words. They are subiect to no conditions as to vowels. Category B telegrams are accepted at a reduced charge per word, but are subject to a special minimum charge as for tour words. A telegram which contains a code word of over 5 letters (whether an aitificial word, or a dictionary word not used with the meaning normally assigned to it in the language to which it belongs) cannot be sent as Category B. It is classed as a category A telegram and is counted and charged for according to the rules for Category A telegrams. In the text of a Category B telegram a proper name or dictionary word used with its ordinary meaning may exceed five letters in length and is charged for at five letters to a word. Figures are not admitted in Category B telegrams except in groups ^ of letters and figures forming commercial marks as defined above under u Plain language.’’. A telegram consisting entirely of plain language words used in the ordinary way is not acceptable at the “Category B” rate, even though non of the words contains more than five letters. If the sender of a telegram eligible for transmission as “Category B” wishes to benefit by the reduced rate he should make this known to the Counter Officer either orally or by marking the form clearly “Category B” The Counter Officer will insert the relative instruction “CDE” in the Official part of the telegram. In all code telegrams words comprising the name and address of the sender, (if to be transmitted separately from the text) are counted at the rate of fifteen letters to the word. CYPHER LANGUAGE. (3). Cypher is composed of:— (a) Arabic figures of groups or series of Arabic figures having a secret meaning ; (b) Words, names expressions or combinations of letters not fulfilling the conditions applicable to plain language or code. Cypher is chargeable at the rate of five characters to a word. It is not permitted to use figure and letter cypher in the same expression.Foreign Telegrams. 129 (4) Telegrams intended for delivery to callers at a Tele graph Office should contain in the address the words “Poste Restante” or “to be called for ” Such telegrams are kept for seven clear days at the office to which they are addressed. (5) Telegrams for Railway passengers should lie addressed ‘'C/o Station Master.” (6) Telegrams indecently or obscenely worded, or appearing to contain grossly offensive matter, will not be transmitted. (7) Inland telegrams are only kept for thee months from the date of transmission, and during that time are not produced except to the sender or addressee, or their duly authorized agents. (8) Enquiries or complaints in regard to Inland telegrams should be addressed to the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs. FOREIGN TELEGRAMS. 310. —Charges The charges for Foreign telegrams will be found at section XIII. 311. —Telegraph Forms and Mode of Payment. Special foims are provided for Foreign telegrams. Stamps must be affixed to the forms by the sender. (2) A receipt for a telegram can be obtained free. A certified copy of an ordinary or deferred telegram can be obtained at a charge of 5 annas for the first 50 words and 5 annas for each additional 50 words or fraction thereof. A certified copy of an urgent telegram is obtainable at 10 annas per 50 words. 312. —Plain Language : Code Language : Cypher. Telegrams are accepted without restriction to most places abroad A few countries, however, still maintain restrictions, of which parti culars are published in the footnotes to the tables of charges on at section XIII. (2) Telegrams in plain language are those composed of words, figures and letters which form an intelligible meaning. They may be expressed in any of the principal European languages, and certain others, including Resperanto. The\ must be written in Roman characters. A single check-word not exceeding ten Jetteis in length may be written at the beginning of the text of a Bankei s or similar telegram without altering its plain language chaiactei. (3) Code language is composed of real words not forming com prehensible phrases, or of pronounceable groups of letters having the appearance of real words. No word or groups of letters mu.-d exceed ten letters in length. The real words may be drawn from any of the130 Foreign Telegrams following languages:—English, French, German, Italian, Spani, Portuguese, Dutch and Latin ; the groups of letters must be pronoun, ceable according to the current usage of one of thpse languages. (4) Cypher is composed :... (a) Arabic figures of groups or series of Arabic figures having a secret meaning, or letters or groups or series of letters having a secret meaning : (b) Words, names, expressions, or combinations of letters not fulfilling the conditions applicable to plain language or code. Letter and figure cypher cannot be combined in one group. It is desirable to avoid the use of letter cypher as far as possible, as it is less easy to transmit than pronounceable groups of letters, and is therefore, more liable to error. Where letter cypher is used, it should be arranged in groups of five letters, in order to facilitate trans mission. (5). Combinations in plain language, code or cypher, formed by running together two or more real words (whole or contracted), are prohibited. 313.—Counting; Compound Words, Misspelt Words, Figures, &amp;c. In plain language the maximum n umber of letters allowed to pas at the charge for a single word is 15, any excess being charged for til the rate of lb letters to a word. Subject to this limit, ordinary compound words and names of towns, countries, provinces, places, family names, and names of ships written without break, are counted as single words ; the same mode of counting applies to the names of streets, squares, &amp;c., and the words Street, Square” &amp;c.,or their equivalents in other languages, canb combined with such names so as to form a single chargeable word. If joined by a hyphen, or separated by an apostrophe, such compound w oi ds oi names are counted as so many separate words. Compound numbers written in words and without break are also counted as single words, subject to the same limit as to the number of letters. The name of the office of destination in the address is charged for as one woi ^ whatever its length ; and when the name of the country, state, province or district has to be added to distinguish the office from o ® 1S 0 the same name, the whole expression is charged for as one word, provided it is written in accordance with the “International List or Telegraph Offices.” ' i / fr ^uiieuuy spelled, so as to reduce the num thp nc^cm °r V +i 16 maximum &gt; or incorrectly joined together, contr; me usage ot the language, are inadmissible.

(2) Don’t send by post valuables, currency notes &amp;c., unless insured with the Post Office. The addressee is liable to be penalised. (3) Don’t entrust articles for posting to servants and messengers. They are not interested in the fate of the letter and the value of the stamps may mean more temptation to them than you think. (-1) Don’t guess at the weight of your letters. Your friends will have to pay double the deficiency at the other end. If the letters are refused you will have to pay. (5) Don’t stamp your letters in odd places. The correct place is in the top right hand corner of the address side. (6) Don’t try to make a stamp collection on each letter. Make up the postage in as few stamps as possible. (7) Don’t forget to use “ Air Mail ” and “ Overland Mail ” labels on articles intended for those services. (8) Don’t imagine our staff are cypher experts. W rite legibly and give a complete address. (9) Don’t post your letter at the last minute. It is liable to be left behind. (10) Don’t economise on envelopes. Long journeys disagree with those that are flimsy or stuffed too full. (11) Don’t bother us with complaints if you will not take this advice.CONTENTS.
