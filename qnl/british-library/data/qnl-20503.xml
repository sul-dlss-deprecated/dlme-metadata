I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th April regarding the validity of the Turco-Persian frontier delimitation of 1913-14, and to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, the accompanying copy of a despatch, with enclosure, which has been received from the High Commissioner for Iraq, together with a copy of a despatch which Sir H. Dobbs has addressed to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran on the subject. 2. Mr. Amery would be glad if he could be favoured with any observations that Sir Austen Chamberlain may have to offer on the questions raised in those despatches. 3. A similar letter has been addressed to the Admiralty. I am, &amp;c. J. E. SHUCKBURGH. Enclosure 1 in No. 1 Sir H. Dohbs to Mr. Amery. (Confidential ' C.') Si rj Bagdad, March 10, 192/. ' I HAVE the honour to forward a copy of a note of a conversation between Mr. Phillip, the American Minister at Tehran, and myself at Bagdad on the 8th March, 1927, regarding the Mohammerah-Caspian Railway and the Turco- Persian boundary on the Shatt-el-Arab. . . u 2. There have been several recent indications that Persia desires to raise the question of the validity of the Turco-Persian frontier delimitation of 191t5-14. The arrangement between Persia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company regarding customs and other matters on the Naftkhana oil-fields in the transferred territories near Khanakin has been challenged by the Majlis, partly on the ground, it is believed, that the Majlis has never'ratified the frontier delimitations, and, on the same ground, the Persian Customs are unwilling to fix a terminus on the frontier beyond Khanakin for the projected extension of the Iraq railways from Khanakin to the frontiers. It is evident that the doubts and difficulties which Mr. Poland feels about the fixing of the southern terminus of the projected railway from the Caspian to the Gulf will powerfully stimulate Persia to raise the question. But it is difficult to see how she can approach it seriously without first formally recognising Iraq. 3. That there is some justification for Persian restiveness on the subject of port dues and control is shown bv the attached note, which sets forth the f act that what is practically the Persian port of Abadan and the undoubtedly Persian port of Mohammerah now yield at least one-third of the effective revenues of the port of Basra.' Something could probably be done to soothe Persian fears by the early formation of the long-discussed Basra Port Trust and the appointment to it of a Persian commissioner. But the Iraq Government would certainly refuse to approach this question also before Persia had granted formal recognition of Iraq. 4 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Britannic M^ajesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and am communicating the note of mv conversation to tlie Prime Minister of Iraq. J I have, &amp;c. H. DOBBS, High Commissioner for Iraq. [100 dd—1]2 Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Note on a Conversation between the High Commissioner aud Mr. Phillip, Americmi Minister at Tehran, at the Residency, Bagdad, on March 8, 19^/. Mr . PHILLIP asked me whether I could tell him anything about the Turco- Persian Boundary Convention of 1913. It seemed not to have been publisne an the Persian Government and their American advisers were concerned about it, particularly in relation to the siting of the terminus of the new railway irom the Caspian to the Persian Gulf. Apparently, under that convention, the boundan oi Iraq was the left shore of the Shatt-el-Arab instead of the centre of the stream, as is usual. They were not clear how far this gave Iraq the right to impose transit lees and port dues on goods passing through to Mohammerah from the Gulf. Mr. Poland, the chief engineer of the Railway Survey, was greatly worried about this question, and was even contemplating laying out the railway by a different route so as to avoid the Shatt-el-Arab and bring the terminus to the head of the Khor Musa (or Khor Abdulla, I forget which) on the Persian Gulf. That would be much more expensive than having the terminus at Mohammerah, and would also give a much worse port. The Minister presumed, however, that the question of the boundary on the Shatt-el-Arab could be the subject of negotiation and that Great Britain would use her influence to secure a rectification of the boundary, since anything which helped on the prosperity of Persia was conducive to peace in the Middle East and the stability of the world, and the railway to the sea w T as also in the interest of British trade. In reply, I asked the Minister whether the question was really an urgent one, for I said I had understood that the construction of the railway must take a good many years and that it was possible that a beginning would be made with the Caspian end. The Minister said no. Under the law passed by the Majlis construction was to start at both ends simultaneously. A sum of 10 million tomans was already available and Mr. Poland foresaw no great difficulty about beginning construction from the Gulf at a very early date. The Shah had quite given up the fantastic idea of waiting until the rails could be manufactured in Persia. I then said that, so far as I could remember without reference to papers, the history of the Turco-Persian frontier delimitation was as follows : By the Treaty of Erzerum of 1846 between Turkey and Persia, the frontier was vaguely outlined, but no delimitation had taken place and the border administration fluctuated. Some where about 1908 Turkey made considerable encroachments on what was undoubted! Persian territory, especially in the direction of Azerbaijan, and the question of delimitation became urgent in the eyes of Persia. After some negotiations (in which, I thought, but was not sure, that Persia had invoked Great Britain as an arbitrator under the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857), the Turkish Foreign Minister or Grand Vizier, and the British, Russian and Persian Ambassadors signed a convention at Constantinople laying down the frontier in considerable detail and agreeing to its being delimited by a joint commission, in which, I believed, the Russian commissioner practically represented the Turkish point of view and the British commissioner the Persian point of view. The convention provided that the findings of the commission were to be final and that the commissioners should transfer any transferable territory on the spot and immediately set up boundary pillars. The commission met in 1913, and had just finished its work and embodied it in a protocol when Turkey declared war on the Allies. So far, at least, as the Iraq portion was concerned, the territories transferable under the delimitation had been actually transferred by the erection of boundary pillars. By this delimitation the frontier of Turkey followed low-water mark on the left side of the Shatt. but I was not sure whether this had not also been mentioned in the Treaty of Erzerum. Persia enjoyed rights of navigation in times of peace and the boundary was so arranged as to give a considerable space of water at the mouth of the Karun River, opposite Mohammerah, to Persia. In time of war I presumed Iraq would have the ri^ht to act in the Shatt as other Governments have the right to act in their territorial waters. I conceived the position of the Shatt to be not unlike that of the Scheldt the mouth of which is Dutch territorial water, although the Belgian port of Antwerp lies further up and navigation through the Scheldt to Antwerp is free I did not see why the Persians or Mohammerah should be more hampered by this situation than are the Belgians and Antwerp by the situation on the mouth of the ScheldtIt was evidently a considerable surprise and shock to the Minister to hear that Russia had been a partner to the frontier delimitation. He had apparently imagined that it had been the result of a direct deal between Great Britain and Turkey. I made no mention of the question of the recognition of Iraq by Persia, without which it is obvious that no attempt at frontier negotiation could be undertaken. H. D. March 9, 1927. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Note hy the Financial Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner on the Subject of Port Revenues and Expenditure. PORT revenues arise from the following sources :— Rupees. {a) Marine ... ... ... 16,36,544 {h) Traffic .. ... ... 16,04,973 (c.) Engineer services ... ... 48,058 \d) Miscellaneous receipts ... ... 1,88,455 34,78,030 Marine receipts are derived from dues on vessels entering port limits, but the fees charged in respect of Abadan and Mohammerah are slightly lower than those charged for Basra. The following figures give an indication of the receipts under this head :— Rupees. Number of steamers that crossed tne bar for Basra 194 Tonnage 7,57,671 Number of steamers that crossed the bar for Abadan and Mohammerah ... ... ... 437 „ 27,28,929 631 „ 34,86,600 Very roughly, therefore, marine traffic revenues may be said to be derived in the proportion of less than one-third Basra traffic. (5.) Traffic receipts are derived from dues on cargo and are almost entirely collected in respect of goods consigned to, and leaving, the port of Basra itself. Roughly, it may be stated that a very small proportion of the revenue shown above comes from Abadan and Mohammerah. {c) and id) Are received for services rendered and may be ignored. Following out the proportions given above, the revenue of the port may be shown to be derived as under:— Lakhs. Lakhs. From Abadan and Mohammerah traffic ... 11 Basra 5 From Abadan and Mohammerah goods ... ... „ 16 11 21 or one-third to two-thirds. It is impossible to split up expenditure in the same way because the cost of the port services are not divided in the accounts according to the classification used for revenue, but it is unquestionable that the cost of producing the marine fees, which necessitate no elaborate shore organisation, is much less than the cost of obtaining the charges on cargo, which are more in the nature of services rendered on shore. It can be stated that the successful results shown by the port are very largely contri buted to by shipping that does not enter the port of Basra, and it is very probable that the port charges would require to be raised materially to secure a balanced budget if the oil-vessel traffic of Abadan and Mohammerah were to cease. But I would not go as far as to say that the port of Basra would fail if it were not for that traffic. F. E. S. March 8. 1927.4 Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Sir H. Dobbs to Sir R. Clive. gnfidential.) ' I HAVE the honour to invite your attention to my despatch, Confidential, £l C,'' dated the 10th March, 1927, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a ^ 0 Py —■ which was forwarded to you under cover of my despatch dated the 10th March, &gt; on the subject of a conversation between myself and Mr. Hoffman Philip in regard to the frontier between Persia and Iraq. 2. There have been various indications during the last two years of a possibility that the Persian Government may, at some future time, attempt to challenge the validity of the decisions of the Boundary Commission of 1913-14 on the ground that those decisions were never ratified by the Majlis. I should be grateful if you could inform me whether any such intention has ever been hinted at by Persian officials in conversation, and whether there is, in your opinion, any serious possibility of such a challenge being attempted. 3. As far as I am able to discover from the documents at my disposal, it would appear that the protocol of November 1913, and the subsequent delimitation of the frontier, were merely steps taken to carry out article 3 of the 1847 Treaty of Erzerum and to determine the frontier roughly defined in article 2 of that treaty. If this is the case, then it would appear that no ratification, either of the protocol of November 1913, or of the decisions of the frontier commission, was necessary. Article 5 of the protocol, in fact, definitely states that Des qu'une partie de la frontiere aura ete delimitee, cette partie sera consideree comme fixee definitivement et ne sera susceptible ni d'examen ulterieur ni de revision.' The preamble to the protocol contains a reference to a protocol signed at Tehran. This protocol, of which I have no copy, would appear, however, merely to have provided for the mixed commission which drew up the protocol of November 1913, and it seems most unlikely that it contained any provision for ratification. The preamble also contains a reference to a ' declaration,' dated the 29th July, 1913, signed in London by Sir Edward Grey and Ibrahim Hakki Pasha, I am unaware of the nature of this declaration, but it appears to have been subsequently ratified by the Turkish Parliament. 4. While such documents as I have been able to consult give no indication whatever that ratification of the findings of the frontier commission was either explicitly or implicitly necessary, it is possible (though, I conceive, unlikely) that such ratification may have been explicitly provided for in some document to which I have not had access, or may be implicitly necessitated by some article in the Persian Constitution. I should be grateful for any information which you could give me in this regard. 5. The formal setting up of boundary pillars usually implies an immediate transfer of sovereignty. While the ' transferred territories v ' have been continuously under the administration, first of the army of occupation, and then of the Iraq Government, I have been unable to trace any record of a formal transfer of administration. Such local enquiries as I have been able to pursue go to show that the territory was, prior to 1914, not effectively administered by either the Persian or the Turkish Government. The authority of the Iraq Government over these territories has not so far been challenged by the Persian Government, and has been implicitly recognised in the correspondence regarding the non-payment of sheep tax by the Sinjabi tribe during their sojourn in these territories. 6 It further appears that in 1920 a joint inspection of the frontier was carried out by an Indian surveyor, Sher Jang Khan, and a Persian official named Muez-ez-Sultan. I am unable to trace any correspondence as to the preliminarv arrangements foi this inspection. It would appear, however, to have been the result of an official arrangement with the Persian Government, and a perusal of the correspondence, copies of which presumably exist in the Legation, may show how far, by acquiescing in the arrangements for this inspection, the Persian Government committed themselves to an acceptance of the frontier as laid down by the commission in 1914. 7.

Confidential.) ^ r, Tehran, April 23, 1927. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your confidential despatch of the 31st March on the question of the validity of the decisions of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission of 1913-14. 2. I entirely agree with your Excellency's conclusion that ratification was never provided for or even contemplated, and my impression is that it has only quite recently occurred^ to the Persian Government to attempt to question the validity of the commission's findings. 3. The only possible justification for the present attitude of the Persian Government (they have not, it must be remembered, taken up this attitude officially) lies in article 22 of the fundamental Law of 1906—7, which runs as,follows :— ' In cases where a part of the revenues or property of the State or of the country is transferred or sold, or in cases where it is found necessary to change the boundaries or frontiers of the country, it shall be done with the ratification of the National Consultative Assembly.' 4. In view, however, of the fact that the Frontier Commission of 1913 fixed the details oi the frontier in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 sixty years anterior to the date of the Persian Constitution, I feel extremely doubtful whether, if the matters were ever submitted to arbitration, a Persian contention would be upheld that the decisions of the commission required to be ratified by the Majlis. 5. The various documents and actions which your Excellency cites strongly support the supposition that ratification was never intended or required, and I consider that if the Persian Government ever should put forward a request to discuss the matter we should be justified in refusing to do so. fi. I am forwarding copies of this correspondence to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and of this despatch to the Government of Endia. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE.

Foreigyi Office to Colonial Office. (Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 25, 1927. WITH reference to your letter of the 27tli April, regarding the validity of the Tnrco-Persian frontier delimitation of 1913-14,1 am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to transmit to you the accompanying copies of correspondence* which has recently been exchanged with His Majesty's Minister at Tehran on this subject. 2. In the Secretary of State's opinion, there can be no question as to the validity of the frontier settlement of 1913-14. In the first place, that settlement merely defined in greater detail the provisions of the Treaty of Erzerum, which was signed sixty years before the Persian Constitution, and therefore did not require ratification by the Majlis ; secondly, the terms of the protocol of the 17th November, 1913, itself (article 5) show clearly that ratification was never intended or required ; and thirdly, the settlement has been tacitly accepted by the Persian Government, and even by the Majlis itself, for more than twelve years. 3. In view of these considerations. Sir Austen Chamberlain has informed Sir R. Clive in the telegram,! a copy of which is enclosed herein, that he fully agrees with his suggestion that His Majesty's Government would be justified in refusing to discuss the validity of the decisions of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission if the Persian Government raised it officially.

The Director General of Customs at Mohammerah has 'been issued the following instructions hy the Llinister of Finance, presumably with the authority of the Persian Government. (1) Without of the^Persian Government no warship is to moor at Ahadan jetty. (2) Without the permission of the Persian Government no ship of any kind other than those 'belons- -ing to the Anglo Persian Oil Company is permitted to load oil in Ahadan. (3) The port office up till now maintained at Ah ad an 'by the authorities of the port of Basrah is to he suppressed on April 17th hy ten o # clock in the morhing and the military will he employed to enforce this measure if this instruction is not complied with.

Pilots or other officials are not fcasxi® allowed to land H.M.S. 'ENTERPRISE', which was due on April 16th, was wirelessed to anchor in midstream or go on to Basrah. There is no organisation at Ahadan to control shipping in the Shatt-al-Arah which has up to now17 now 'been regulated lay the port authorities of Basrah. The suppression of the representative st at Ahadan of the Basrah port aothority will result in the removal of all the usual port facilities, pilots, harbour masterft office, etc. As no substitute has 'been affected the step will cause complete dislocation of traffic, 60 % of the tommage which has hitherto 'been oil 'bunkering at Ahadan will 'be excluded under the prohibitions contained in paragraphs (l) and (2). They comprise Admiralty, Asiatic Petroleum Coy. and other tankers. A river steamer moored against the jetty and an office on shore form the port office at Ahadan, It is proposed 'by the Port Director, Basrah, to remove the office on shore and the gangway Joining the vessel and the landing hut, leaving the vessel where she is and to hoist the Iraa flag as the steamer is in Iraq, waters. Minister of Finance has made the follov/ing temporary modifications upon my immediately discussing matters with im m at the urgent request of the Anglo Persian Oil Company. Paragraph (2). The Finance Minister said that the permission required was in the nature of a mere formality and could he accorded 'by the director General of Customs at Mohammerah. Paragraphs (3), (4) and (5). If the Port Ship is anchored away from the shore and the Basrah Port Office is removed from Persian territory, msX no interference would he made with existing harhour arrange -ments and extension of three days would he given for removing the Port Ship. As regards paragraph (1) the Minister of Einance telegraphed to the Prime Minister for permission/r permission for H.M.S. ^ENTEEPRISE ,, to moor at A'badan. He maintained that such permission was in future essential in the case of vessels of war. I 'believe that Paragraph (2) infringes the commercial rights of the Anglo Persian Oil Company under the concession they hold.

The whole of the actions are so provocative that either the Minister for Finance is acting without the approval of the Persian Government, or he is definitely riding for a fall with us; if it is the latter it suggests that Russian support has 'been obtained in advance. I can only imagine that the Minister for Finance is trading upon his power of calling off the bulk of the Anglo Persian Oil Company's Persian employees thus throning out of gear the entire work of the Company. If the Persian Government are going to back him in this action it produces a situation which I would respectfully state we cannot stomach. HAWOETHsjkmoam^ Telegram p.

My telegram No. 508.was a statement of the position vis a vis Finance atCT&amp;x Minister*s deeds and as demanding diplomatic action for what he did hut also realising the necessity of diplomatic conversation for what he desired to do. The main point at issue is one which I have 'been studying for some time hut have left alone on the grouni. of letting sleeping dogs lie. One could only anticipate diplomatic action xdt and not conduct like the Finance Minister's. A position at a port where ships lie in Iraq, water and the frontier line is half way up the jetty to the land is one which needs careful adjustment. The Persian Government could legally put a customs post on every jetty or could demand that every ship landing goods in Ahadan should receive a customs clearance for these goods hy visiting the only Persian port i.e. Mohammerah before landing goods or taking cargo from ^Persia. But whatever the justification for the necessity for some diplomatic conversation I trust that in the interests of our position in the Persian G-ulf we shall refuse to allow conduct of the nature of that of the Finance Minister which, rude as it was to us, was in one instance practically a declaration of war at the expiration of a time limit on a country for which we have a mandate.

The principle I have gone on under the orders of the Departirental Commission is that where mattery Concern the Persian Gulf as a whole I as Hesident address the GoverniLent of India under whom I serve who can through the India Office let such other departments know as may 'be required if they desire; at the same time I repeat to Minister so that he shall know what I am doing. ¥here matters concern Ara'b politics of the Persian Gulf I address the Colonial Office, repeating to the Government of India, when Persian politics, the Minister, repeating to the Government of India. In this instance it was not I 'but the Consul, Ahwaz, who, as was his 'business, duly reported direct to Minister repeating to me as Resident. I as Resident gave to the Government of India my views on the situatioi^also showing how the incident would affect the Persian Gulf as a whole, vide my following telegram No. 518. Had I 'been Political Resident in the Persian Gulf only and not Consul General at all my telegramsM telegrams would equally have gone to you on this subject, as affecting the Government of India. Similarly the M PATRIGK STSWAET' is a Government of India ship and I have addressed telegrams on this subject sometimes to I^e^ation sometimes to G-overn'' -ment of India according/ to which Government was affected with the immediate point, repeating to the other. It will 'be seen that throughout I am acting on a fiied principle. As regards reports as to our assets of force. My personal temperament is one that always uses diplomatic methods in the first instance 'but I think it necessary to know the force awailahle 'behind even when the chance of necessity for its use is remote. I personally always prefer to 'be prepared with the whole knowledge as one never knows which way things will turn. You must remejfcber I did not suggest forcible action 'but suggested I knew it would not 'be used, hut I gave what no one else would know , the strength of our position vis a vis Persia in the South. For strong diplomatic action it is necessary to know that you really have force to fall hack on and the office dealing with the question is stronger if it knows all that subordinate offices can tell it hence telegram No. 54 was addressed to Tehran as a matter in which I was subordinate to Tehran. d?VV This is all that I have attempted to do. I have had no desire for anything but moderation and my telegrams have throughout referred to diplomatic inter- -vention. My telegram No. 517 though brought out by this was a point I had already under consideration and at which I have hinted at in several despatches regarding the Persian Gulf.

WITH reference to my despatch Xo. 178 of the 20th April, I have the honour to inform you of the situation which has arisen regarding the visits of British warships to Persian ports. 2. On the loth. April the resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company communicated to me a copy of a telegram which he had received from the Mohammerah. office of the company informing him that H.M S. ' Enterprise ' proposed to visit Abadan from the 16th to the 21st April, and that it was desired that the captain should visit Maidan-i-Naftun with a party from the ship and that some of the crew should land to play football. As the Persian authorities had shown a disposition to raise objections in a previous similar case, it was suggested that the local authorities should be instructed on this occasion to make no difficulties. 3. The company were anxious that for the sake of their own position the proposed programme should be carried out, and, on the other hand, it appeared to me that the Persian authorities would undoubtedly be within their legal rights—though they have hitherto not tried to enforce them—in preventing the landing of anyone from the ship without duly vise passports in the absence of the notice which, in the case of other countries, it is customary to give when a British warship visits a foreign port. \\ ith the Persian Government in its present temper and with the clear warning of the previous objections, it seemed best to run no risks of an incident. I therefore addressed, on the evening of the 15th April, an urgent private letter to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, informing him of the proposed visit and requesting that the local authorities should be instructed by telegraph that there was no objection to the proposed landing of the parties of officers and men of H.M.S. ' Enterprise.' My request was in the end complied with, but with the usual Persian dilatoriness it was not until the 19th April that 1 received the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs' reply (dated the 17th April), and it was not even then clearly stated that telegraphic instructions had been given. 4. In the meanwhile H.M.S. ' Enterprise ' had arrived at Abadan, had anchored in mid-stream to avoid conflict with the instructions given by the Persian Minister of o */ Finance referred to in the first enclosure to my despatch mentioned above, and had left on the 18th April for Basi-a. I was informed of this by the resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, w T ho expressed the hope that matters could be arranged so that the ship could return to Abadan and the officers and men land as originally proposed. I sent the oriental secretary to see the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday. He was full of explanations and apologies for the delay which had occurred, and told Mr. Havard that he thought the permission for the parties from H.M.S. ' Enterprise' to land would hold good if she returned. Mr. Havard said we must know for certain that the ship could tie up at the jetty at Abadan, if required, and the parties land without incident. His Excellency promised to see the Prime Minister this morning and to telephone the result to the Legation. As no telephone message was received, I to-day addressed to the captain of the cruiser the telegram repeated to you under No. 105. I have since showm the text to the Minister of Court, wLo said he had no objections to raise. I trust, therefore, that the bad impression which must, I fear, have been created by the incident will be removed by the ship's return to Abadan and carrying out the landing programme. 5. It was not until I received this morning telegram No. 8 from His Majesty's consul at Ahwaz, which 1 have repeated to you under No. 106, that I learnt of a further serious feature of the matter—the sending of a customs launch to stop H.M.S. ' Enterprise' in mid-stream off the port of Abadan. I have the honour to enclose a copy of the official protest which I am addressing to the Persian Government on this point, as stated in my telegram No. 108 of to-day's date. I have taken this opportunity of reaffirming the rights of Iraq over the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab up to low-water mark on the Persian side, with the consequent corollary that ships may [464 g—3]moor alongside the jetty without coming withm Persian jurisdiction. This will, I trust meet the main point raised in Sir H. Dobbs's telegram to the Colonial Office of the 19th April. 6. In conclusion, I must add that i am strongly of the opinion that we can no longer make an exception in the case of Persia to the normal rule by which the visits of warships to a foreign port are notified beforehand to the Government involved Persia will no longer submit to be treated cavalierly and on a different footing from other countries in such matters, and I am convinced that it is bad policy to attempt to continue such practices. I have therefore addressed to you to-day my telegram No. 107 suggesting that the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf should be instructed to inform me in advance of any visits of British warships to Persian ports in order that I may notify the Persian Government. Copies of this despatch and of its enclosure are being sent to the Government of India, His Majesty's High Commissioner at Bagdad, His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire and His Majesty's consul at Ahwaz. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir R. Clive to the Acting Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. (No. 86.) M. le Gerant, Tehran, April 20, 1928. HIS Majesty's consul at Ahwaz has reported to me that when H.M.S. ' Enter prise,' of whose visit to Abadan I had the honour to notify your Excellency in my semi-official letter of the 15th April, reached the neighbourhood of that port, a Persian customs launch was despatched to stop her in mid-stream. 2. I must emphatically protest against this action of the Persian authorities. Since, under treaty, the low-water line on the Persian side of the Shatt-el-Arab constitutes the frontier-line between Iraq and Persia, the Persian authorities have no kind of right to interfere in any way with shipping on the Iraq side of this line, and the action of the customs launch constitutes a direct infringement of the rights of Iraq. I understand that the Customs acted under direct orders from the Minister of Finance. 3. I take this opportunity of pointing out that, in consequence of the position of the frontier at low-water mark, any jetty at Abadan or elsewhere on the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab projects into Iraq territorial waters. Any ship therefore lying at any such jetty is incontestably within Iraq territorial waters, and the Persian authorities have no jurisdiction over her nor right to interfere with her mooring in such a position.

If it was for ships proposing to touch Persian territory I could appreciate grounds for such order but as it stands it seems dangerous and unwise admission of Persian claims to % Shatt al Arab and I trust it. may be countermanded.

RESIDENT. \[This Docutiienl is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] PEESIA. CONFIDENTIAL. November 22, 1928. Section 1. [e 5367/55/34] No. 1. Lord CusheTiduTi to Sir R. Clive (Tehran) (No. 561.) , Foreign Office, November 22, 1928. WITH reference to paragraph 20 of my despatch No. 528 of the 7th November, it may be useful that I should develop in greater detail certain considerations regarding the Iraq-Persian frontier on the Shatt-el-Arab, a question regarding which some misapprehension evidently exists on the part of the Persian Minister of the Court, as he has on various occasions stated that he considers it contrary to international custom and unfair to Persia, and has even hinted that it is not regarded by the Persian Government as legally valid. 2. The relevant provisions of the Turco-Persian Treaty of Erzerum, signed on the 31st May, 1847, run as follows : — ' Le Gouvernement ottoman s'engage formellement a ce que la ville et 1'echelle de Mohammerah, Tile de Khizr ' [the modern island of Abadan], ' le lieu d ancrage, et aussi les terrains de la rive orientale, c'est-a-dire de la rive gauche du Chat-el-Arab, qui sont en la possession des tribus reconnues comme relevant de la Perse, soient dans la possession du Gouvernement persan en pleine souverainete. Outre cela, les navires persans auront le droit de naviguer en pleine liberte sur le Chat-el-Arab, depuis Tendroit oil ce fleuve se jette dans la mer jusqu au point de contact des frontieres des deux parties.' 3. It is evident from the wording of these paragraphs that the framers of the Treaty of Erzerum contemplated that the lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab should belong to Persia, but that the whole of the river should remain under Turkish sovereignty. If it had been intended that the frontier should be fixed at the thalweg or in mid-stream, there would have been no occasion for the special provision giving Persian ships liberty of navigation up to the point of contact of the frontiers of the two parties. It would thus be wrong to assert that the 1913-14 frontier settlement, by which, generally speaking, and except in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, all the river was left under Ottoman sovereignty and the frontier fixed at low-water mark on the Persian bank, deprived Persia of her rights under the Treaty of Erzerum to a more favourable frontier on the Shatt-el-Arab. The 1913-14 settlement merely fulfilled in this respect the obvious intentions of the Treaty of Erzerum, and incidentally confirmed Persia's claim to certain territory on the eastern bank which had been long disputed by Turkey. 4. It is not necessary here to enter into a detailed refutation of the statement contained in the Persian Minister of the Court's private letter of the 19th April, a copy of which was enclosed in your despatch No. 178 of the 20th April, that the protocol signed by the British, Russian, Persian and Turkish plenipotentiaries at Constantinople on the 17th November, 1913, has never entered into force, and is contested by the Persian Government. You are already aware from Sir Austen Chamberlain's telegram No. 63 of the 25th May, 1927, and the Foreign Office letter of the same date to the Colonial Office, of the reasons for maintaining the undoubted validity of the 1913-14 frontier settlement, chief amongst which is the fact that article 5 of the protocol in question, which provides that each part of the frontier should be considered as finally settled as soon as it was delimited, and would not thereafter be open to further examination or revision, shows clearly that its ratification was never intended or required. In view, however, of the above-quoted provisions of the Treaty of Erzerum, the Minister of the Court is under a further misapprehension in supposing that this question could affect the validity of the present frontier so far as the Shatt-el-Arab is concerned. 5. There remains the contention that the present frontier is unfair to Persia, highly illogical in principle, and contrary to international rules and universal custom. I transmit to you the accompanying copy of a memorandum prepared in this Department, which shows that there is some foundation for the Minister of the [632 y—1] \2 Court's opinion that when this frontier was fixed, it was not fixed in accordance with general international practice. But it does not therefore follow that the present frontier is entirely indefensible on the grounds of equity. It may be true that no exact precedent exists elsewhere for an important navigable waterway separating two States being subject to the almost complete sovereignty of one of those States, but it may be equally true that there is no exact parallel elsewhere to the special conditions in that region. There are, in fact, circumstances which render any assumption that the present frontier is inequitable at least open to question. Persia has a coastline of nearly 1,000 miles, and has many other ports besides those on the Shatt-el-Arab. Iraq, on the other hand, has practically no coastline, and her only port is at Basra, 70 miles from the sea. It does not seem fundamentally unjust that Iraq should remain in possession of full sovereignty over the waterway from Basra to the sea, and I am not aware of any evidence which shows that Persia's vital interests are seriously prejudiced by the fact that these waters, over which she enjoys full liberty of navigation, are Iraqi national waters. Any legitimate grievance which she may be shown to have in connexion with the present system of levying the necessary navigation dues might well be remedied without changing the frontier. 6. If, however, as a result of the good offices of His Majesty's Government, consequent on a general settlement on the lines indicated in my despatch under reference, Iraq agrees to abandon the advantage of her present incontrovertible title to the existing frontier and admit Persian sovereignty over half the river, care will evidently have to be taken to ensure that Iraq's vital interests are not thereby endangered. Such a concession will have to be accompanied by safeguards devised to prevent Persia from interfering with the navigation of the river, and thereby cutting Iraq's only line of communication with the Persian Gulf. Persia's recent record of hostility towards Iraq shows the danger of increasing her opportunities of obstructing her neighbour's trade; and if Persia proceeds with her present intention of constructing a new port at Khor Musa, the future danger of such deliberate obstruction by her of shipping proceeding to the rival Iraqi port of Basra will be much increased. I am, &amp;c. CUSHENDUN. Enclosure in No. 1. Rivers as Boundaries between States. Practice in regard to fixing Boundary Lines. 1. MARTENS ( Droits des Gens,' 1 1820 Edn.) speaking of rivers as boundaries says : bi les deux rives sont occupees par deux nations differentes, e qu il ne conste pas laquelle a occupe la premiere, l egalite des droits des nations mene naturellement au principe confirme dans une multitude de traites, que chacune des deux nations est maitresse de la riviere et des iles qui s'y trouvent jusqu 'au im leu e rivl ® re : Cependant, rien n'empeche d'en disposer differemment par traite et d attribuer a 1 une des nations le droit sur tout le fleuve,' j ^ su PP 0 £t 9^ possibility, he quotes the pretensions of four electors m regard to the Rhine. The volumes to which he refers as containing records of this case ( Sammlung von Staatsschriften nach Ableben Carls VII ' and Sartorius: og- de navigatione Rheni ') are, however, not available here, nor can they be tound m the London Library or the British Museum. o Later writers on international law state unanimously that when a nayi^a e nver orms the boundary between States, the thalweg is generally taken as the line of separation between the States, but indicate that cases may arise where the sovereignty over the whole river may belong to one of the riparian States, rnor occupation, uncontested sovereignty exercised over a long period, and cession Jv 7 are 1 H u o ted as possible grounds for the exceptional cases, but no examples en qui ry 1 ar^quoted ^ considered as having any bearing upon the present it Hitnrw r^ eri1 in P stance aPPears in the case of the Ems estuary, which, though Cprmanv wh ^f 11 . fro ^} Dlltcl1 territory, is claimed over its entire width by Ge any, who during the war exercised practically her sovereignty over it by^controlling all shipping, including Dutch vessels, within the estuary. As, however, It inhere appears to be no doubt that the claim is based upon the falsification, by German gal cartographers tor their own ends, of certain deeds of 1454, it is hardly suitable for ise as a P^^dent. in any case, the matter has not yet been settled between the llelf^wo Governments and the questions of principle involved have not been argued. 'esir|; I have examined, as far as possible, all agreements in Europe, Africa and 3eii| ^ mer . lca 11 m ^ v ^ llc ^ . a riv er forms an agreed boundary between States, and in -tsf^ractically all treaties between civilised States where a navigable waterway has otw )een acce P^ e( ^ as . € of territory, the thalweg of that waterway is given as the : ictual boundary line. It is sometimes described as ' the middle of'the stream ' or ,^1 'he channel, but the result in any case is to divide more or less equally the .. sovereignty over the stream between the two parties. or 6. One important exception arises in Africa, where in an agreement between ^ -'ranee and Liberia, signed in Paris the _18th September, 1907, fixing the boundaries between French West Africa and Liberia, the boundary line was fixed on the right ^ or Liberian) bank of the River Nuon, and on the right (or Liberian) bank of the ^iver Cavallez, France thus obtaining full control over both rivers. Navigation ■ights were retained for Liberian nationals in a subsequent article of the treaty. m 7. The Anglo-German Agreement of the 1st July, 1890, regarding spheres of nfluence in Africa, contains several instances of boundaries having been fixed on ■Wiianks of rivers. There is no reason given for this course, but as no question of ictual sovereignty was involved the boundaries appear to have been intentionally lomewhat loosely drawn, and, in any case, the freedom of transit, &amp;c., on all the Wliwaterways concerned was retained for both parties. f ill 8. In African treaties between European Powers where a waterway of any mportance is involved, the thalweg is laid down as the boundary line, opp 9. Boundary agreements between South American States provide no exceptions Hfljothe general rule, but I find that the original Mexican-United States Boundary a^iCreaty of the 12th January, 1828, # described the boundary line as being on the western porttpr Mexican) bank of the River Sabine and on the southern (or Mexican) bank of he Red River, thus bringing the whole river in each case into United States territory, following the war between the United States and Mexico, t Texas in the meantime M laving revolted from Mexico and been received into the Union, a new boundary was iefined in the Treaty of Peace of 1848. The Rio Grande del Norte was now made -he dividing line in the east between the two nations, but the boundary was described is being ' up the middle of the river.' 10. The only other exceptions I have been able to trace refer to streams having io commercial value, or to cases where, in order to retain under a single jurisdiction i town which has been built on both banks of a river, a small sector on the opposite mnk has been given to one of the parties. 11. It is clear that, for the past century at least, the thalweg of a stream jllividing two territories has been universally accepted as the actual boundary line, |J|d the small number and the unimportance of the exceptions serve but to emphasise -he general practice in this respect.

In point of fact, the commissioners' line as shown on the Admiralty char goes right across the stream and finishes up in what the Admiralty Nlii regard as lurkish territory, with the result that Turkey, and now Iraq, S ets none of die stream a a 1 It is, m fact, impossible to reconcile the commissioners' work Hatti with the idea that the mouth of the river lies between the points of the two peninsulas riband that national waters continue up to that point. 1 suggest, therefore, that we should ask the Admiralty to consider whether the %a|:' nature oi these two peninsulas is really such that we are bound to regard them as tty being 1 ersian and Iraq territory respectively and as forming the base lines for their itcetif territorial waters. According to the Admiralty chart, at any rate, the narrow Hpk portion ot the 1 ersian peninsula, and apparently the' whole of the Iraq one, are an, Jdescnbed as dries m patches at low-water springs.' I take this as meaning that setmjN the whole ot the two areas in question are never above water, and that patches of onffji; them are above water at low spring tide, but at no other time. If so, it seems to me extremely questionable whether the areas in question can be regarded as land which scdJuI ' the base line for territorial waters. According to the reply which has just .. . been drawn up by the Departments concerned to the League of Nations ijipi yuvstionnaire^hout territorial waters, 'the base line is the line of mean low water s P r ^ n S tides. I take this to mean that the land above this line must all be above water at low spring tides, and, if so, the areas in question would not seem to fall within the definition. ^ It is to be noted, further, that the drying patches in these areas ao not fall within the definition of islands in the same memorandum, because ' they are not ' in normal circumstances permanently above high water,' and could ^tj therefore, support, as islands, a base line. I should imagine that what happened 4, was that when the commission arrived on the spot the whole of these areas were f under water, and that they accordingly regarded the coast as being what is marked on the Admiralty chart by the thick green and red shading, the mouth of the river l - as lying at that point, and everything beyond as being the sea. This is the onlv ,view which is, in my opinion, reconcilable with what they in fact did, and it is con- V firmed by the fact that on their map the Persian coast obviously corresponds to the ■F green shading, and Maraket Abadan does not appear at all; its site is covered bv ip the words cc Persian Gulf.' K the Admiralty on reconsideration were to think this a view which we could dil uphold, our difficulties would largely vanish. If the base line of Persian territorial erte, waters is taken from the thick green shading, the whole of the Rooka Channel would les;; lie in the open sea. The Western Channel might be partly in Persian territorial waters until it entered Iraq national waters, but there would, of course, be the right one of innocent passage, and it would seem more likely that the limit between Iraq and toi Persian territorial waters would be regarded as running down the middle of it. A mi : possible modification of this view might be that the base line for Persian territorial il| waters is to run not from the thick green shading, but from a line somewhere in the [if; Vicinity of 'North Mast' (since the area north-west of that may have stronger offej claims to count as land), but even in that case nearly the whole of the Rooka Channel me would still be in the open sea and the rest in Persian territorial, not national, waters, ialtf I think that the above represents the most defensible line for us to take, and I iilE) Sll ggest that the Admiralty should be asked to reconsider the question in the light leiS the above observations. id H.

Mr. Amery would be glad to be furnished as soon as possible with any observations that Sir Austen Chamberlain may have to offer in regard to the points raised in Sir H. Dobbs's despatch. 3. A copy of a letter which Mr. Amery has caused to be addressed to the Admiralty is enclosed herewith, for Sir Austen Chamberlain's information, and copies of this letter are being forwarded to the India Office, Air Ministry and Board of Trade. I am, &amp;c. T. I. K. LLOYD. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Sir H. Dobbs to Mr. Amery. (Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, January 26, 1929. I HAVE the honour to invite your attention to despatch No. 37 dated the 19th January, 1929, from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran to the Foreign Office, giving cover to a copy of a draft Bill on the subject of Persian territorial waters. 2. It appears fo me that the last half of the first article of that Bill, which provides for a supplementary zone extending beyond the usual 3-mile limit to a limit of 8 nautical miles from the coast, within which police rights will be exercised, may give rise to a conflict between the Persian and Iraq authorities in respect of the channel through the Shatt-el-Arab bar. The channel through the outer bar, unusually known as the Rooka Channel, extends in an east-south-easterly direction from latitude 29° 54' 5' north, longitude 48° 40 / 3'' east, to latitude 29° 52' 6' north, longitude 48° 44' 3'' east. The whole of the channel, therefore, though lying more than 3 nautical miles from both the Iraq and Persian coasts, lies within 8 nautical miles from the nearest point on the Persian coast. Subject, therefore, to the observations in the immediately following paragraph, I presume that the Persian Government will be able, if this Bill becomes law, to claim the right to exercise police supervision for the purposes specified in the law over ships passing through this channel, including the British-India mail steamers. It is obviously impossible that such supervision should be permitted, and I hope that His Majesty's Government will give due weight to this point when considering the other objections to this Bill which may exist, but with which I am not concerned. 3. I presume that if, despite any objections that may be raised by His Majesty's Government, the Bill does eventually become law, it will be impossible to maintain that the Rooka Channel lies outside the 8-mile limit. There is, however, one point to be considered in this connexion. I am not aware of the international principles governing the prolongation into the sea of a land frontier, but I presume that it is the practice for the line dividing the territorial waters of two adjacent countries, either to be an extension of the general direction of the adjacent portion of the land frontier between the two countries, or to be at right angles to the general direction of the coast line. A line drawn on the former principle could be drawn so as to exclude the Rooka Channel from the Persian supplementary zone. A line drawn on the latter principle, however, would not so exclude it. I do not in any case consider that it would be safe to allow the Bill to pass unchallenged, and to trust to the subsequent exclusion from its scope of the Rooka Channel. 4. In the same connexion, I wish to call your attention to an incident which occurred recently in the Rooka Channel and which is not unlikely to be repeated. I enclose, for your information, a copy of a despatch which I sent to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran complaining of the conduct of the Persian Government steam yacht 'Ivy' in the Rooka Channel. It seems to me possible that the Persian Government, without at the moment definitely asserting any right of their own in regard to the channel, may reply by challenging the right of the Iraq Government to exercise any control over the channel, which undoubtedly lies through its whole length outside Iraq territorial waters, the westerly end of the channel being about 7 nautical miles from the nearest point of Iraq. I should be grateful if you would take into early consideration the question of the right, according to international law, of the Iraq Government to control navigation passing through a channel which has been dredged by the Iraq Government in the open sea. If such a right is notalready established, m view of the fact that the channel is a necessary approach to a navigable waterway of international concern which is under their control, it seems to me possible that the Iraq Government could take steps to regularise the position by legislation. I presume, however, that such legislation would be liable to bo challenged immediately by the Persian Government. I should be glad if I could receive an early intimation of your opinion upon these points, which appear likely to assume considerable importance in the near future. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran and to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. H. DOBBS, High Commissioner for Iraq. 'C Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Sir H.

She is reported to have ignored all signals and to have taken no notice of the channel regulations, thereby causing considerable danger to herself and to other vessels in the channel at the time. 2. The channel referred to is the new channel which has been dredged by the Iraq Port Directorate through the Shatt-el-Arab bar, and dredging is still ^ in progress. I should be grateful if you would call the attention of the Persian Government to this incident, and suggest to them, in their own interests, and their vessels should make a practice of conforming to the regulations for navigating the Shatt-el-Arab and its approaches.

Sir Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Admiralty to Foreign Office. Admiralty, February 25, 1929. I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to your letter of the 28th December, 1928, relative to the Perso-Iraq frontier at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and to put forward the following observations tor the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2. Since the Admiralty letter of the 10th December was written, and the chart cutting which formed the enclosure to that letter prepared, the original signed showing the boundary line as fixed by the Delimitation Commission appointed under the 1913 protocol, and also the minutes of the meeting's of the commission, have been borrowed from your Department and the question given further consideration. 3. The above-mentioned chart cutting was prepared from the map stitched up with the 1913 protocol, which had previously been borrowed from the Colonial Office, and wrongly assumed to show the boundary as finally settled. It appears evident that the boundary line was only roughly drawn on this map to illustrate the text oi t e protocol, and that no importance is to be attached to the continuation of the line seaward from the southern termination on the Persian bank. _ _ 4. The minutes of the commission and the original map shows that the commission fixed the starting-point of their work at a point on the bank 2 miles below a fort (shown on the map and also on the Admiralty chart) on the Persian side opposite, but a little below, Fao. There is also drawn on the map in a south-easterly direction from this point a line in yellow (the frontier line is shown in red) which does not appear to be explained in the minutes. It is suggested that it was put in to show what appeared to the commissioners, when they proceeded down the rive r {possibly at high water), to represent the coast line, they having found the map mthis respect incorrect. Otherwise it is difficult to understand why thev commenr^ the frontier line where they did. 5 It appears evident from the text of the protocol that the commission's man must be accepted as authoritative, as article 5 states that as soon as a part of thp irontier shall have been settled, that part shall be considered as fixed definitely and shall not be liable to subsequent examination nor revision. Article 4 also says that m case of any disagreement amongst the four commissions (Russian, British, Turkish and Persian), the Russian and British Commissioners are to meet privately and their decision is to be recognised as binding on all four Governments ?• ^ OTds would suggest, however, that it might be possible to maintain if tins is thought expedient, that the commission had made a mistake in starting where ney did and that it is obvious that the river does not commence at that point hnt much further seaward, and that the line should be extended along the Persian shorp m accordance with the text of the protocol. In view of the possibility of the Abadan and Abdullah banks becoming obviously territory in the future, 'there would be obvious advantages m such an understanding being arrived at. . . * ^ ter f urt her consideration of the information available, my Lords are of opinion that the Abadan and Abdullah banks cannot at present be regarded as a^ follows VieW 18 su PP orted b.Y a paragraph in the protocol, which states Turkish jurisdiction shall not be extended over portions of the Persian coast which may be temporarily covered by the tide ('couvertes d'eau par la maree ) or through other accidental causes.

The examination of the draft Territorial Waters Bill has not yet been completed, but it is observed that the Bill is ambiguously drafted, and its intentions jftjE as regards the supplementary zone are by no means clear. Article 6 lays down that idpf regulations prescribed for territorial waters and the supplementary zone shall IjJ be applicable to foreign vessels in territorial waters. This would seem to imply that it ® 110116 01 these regulations should be applicable to foreign vessels in the supplementary zone. This, however, is not consistent with the regulations in Part II (see, for J example, articles 13 and 17), many of which apply to foreign war vessels in the / supplementary zone, and it is observed that Sir R. Olive has obviouslv read the Bill u as applying generally to foreign vessels in the supplementary zone. 4. My Lords concur with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his remarks as to the undesirability of Persia being given the right to search Arab shipping outside the 3-mile limit. 11 '5- In connexion with the slavery question also, unless His Majesty's ships are 1 : to be allowed to retain the right to search in Persian waters, this supplementary zone might result in a still further limitation of the right of search. ^ 6. The aspect of the proposal which my Lords consider most dangerous is the question of the Shatt-el-Arab. The Rooka Channel is at present indispensable to the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab by heavy vessels, and as it is outside the ordinary i r 3-mile limit, its control by Iraq is liable to be challenged by Persia, who may claim - control over it as within their 8-mile supplementary zone/ Moreover, as stated in P Admiralty letter of the 25th February (sent to Foreign Office, Colonial Office and ei India Office), there would appear to be no definite rule as regards drawing the boundary between the territorial waters of two adjacent countries in cases like those f of Iraq and Persia, so that the question of the control of the river estuary inside pt the Rooka Channel is liable to give rise to dispute. 7. The navigation of the river channel is intricate, and only the rigid enforce- eis ment of the local rules of navigation will prevent frequent accidents. It is therefore essential to resist any measure by which the Persians may claim to exercise police el supervision over the estuary, including the Rooka Channel. 1 8. As remarked above by the High Commissioner in his telegram of the 18th G February, the difficulties in respect of the Rooka Channel form a strong argument if for reaching an agreement with Persia regarding the control of the Shatt-el-Arab ti and its approaches. iff 9. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Colonial Office, India Office, Air nil Ministry and Board of Trade. I am, &amp;c. H L'l [e 962/58/34] Enclosure 9 in No. 1. Foreign Office to Colonial Office. Sir. Foreign Office, March 14, 1929. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st February, forwarding for any observations which he might have to offer the copy of a despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq regarding the situation as between Iraq and Persia at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.■ea—IT-M y- vs. s 2. Mr. Secretary Amery will have observed from to-despondence ending with Admiralty letters of the 25th February and the 6th March, that the boundary Tine at the mouth of that river has already been the subject of detailed examination in this department and the Admiralty. This correspondence, which has no doubt already been forwarded to the High Commissioner, will have shown him that, even apart from any fresh complication which might possibly be introduced by the passage of a Persian Territorial Waters Bill claiming a right to exercise police supervision in a zone extending to a limit of 8 nautical miles from the Persian coast, the situation is one of no little complexity and might well give rise to serious difficulties between Iraq and Persia. 3. It will be seen from paragraph 7 of their letter of the 25th February that, i on the information at present available, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are of opinion that the Abadan and Abdullah banks cannot at present be regarded as territory. If this view is correct, the Rooka Channel lies in the open sea; and as His Majesty's Government have never admitted and have always objected to the claims of foreign States to exercise rights of jurisdiction or control over the waters of | the high seas outside the 3-mile limit of their territorial waters, they could logically refuse to admit a Persian claim to exercise jurisdiction over this channel. But the Persian Government may not share this view, and if they were able to establish that the Abadan Bank is territory, their claim would probably be much more difficult to refute. It would, therefore, seem useful if the High Commissioner could arrange for a fresh survey to be unostentatiously carried out, every precaution being taken to avoid arousing Persian suspicions, and the actual situation of the Persian and Iraqi coast lines at low-water spring tides to be precisely ascertained, with a view to the possibility of refuting such a Persian claim, taking into account the fact that, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, the base line for the determination of the limit of territorial waters is the line of mean low-water spring tides, following the sinuosities of the coast. 4. Even if, however, it can be abundantly established that the Abadan and Abdullah banks are not territory, the position would still be liable to lead to disputes, as there seems to be no universally recognised principle of international law governing the lateral limitation of the territorial waters at the mouth of a river between the two riparian States. Persia might, therefore, claim jurisdiction over at least a part of the navigable channel between the Rooka Channel and the river mouth. Although it might be possible to resist such a claim on the lines suggested in paragraph 8 of the Admiralty letter of the 25th February, and although even if a part of the channel were in Persian territorial waters, there would still be a right of innocent passage along it, it is clearly desirable in the interests of Iraq to avoid the possibility of disputes of this nature by agreeing to the adoption of some such scheme as that advocated in the two memoranda enclosed in the Foreign Office letter of the 7th March. By placing the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, including Iraqi and Persian territorial waters and (so far as concerns ships of the contracting States) the Rooka Channel, under the control of the proposed conservancy board, on which Persia is to be adequately represented, such inducements to Persia as may at present exist to raise contentious issues of this nature will be removed. Sir Austen Chamberlain agrees entirely with the view of the High Commissioner that the uncertainty of the present situation at the mouth of the river is an argument which should prove of primary importance for persuading the Iraqi Government of the necessity for a general settlement with Persia on the lines now under consideration. 5. I am to add that any claim by Iraq, whether based on legislation or not, to control the Rooka Channel would be inconsistent with the views of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, as stated in paragraphs III (c) and (d) of their memorandum sent last December to the League of Nations in reply to the cc Schedule of Points regarding Territorial Waters,' drawn up by the Preparatory Committee for the First' Codification Conference. 6. Copies of this correspondence are being sent to the Admiralty, the Air- Ministry, the Board of Trade, the Dominions Office and the India Office; and a copy of a despatch to Sir R.

In view^however, of the peculier diffi culties caused by this frontier and by the congestion often prevailing at the one available jetty a special agreement has been reached whereby certain formaiiities may be carried out before the arrival of a ship at the t jetty e So far no eomplaint has ever been made to my knowledge by any of the shipping firms concisrn^d nor by the Captain of any merchant recseX, i 2. In regard to the ^aiantine officer the same remark, apply to him and I understand that relations are very good between him and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company i.td e , Messrs orick 3cott Co., and the B. 1.

From my recent conversation with the Governor of Abadan and the Provincial director of Custom US JXusJfcZ. there appears to be no foundation for &lt;&lt;K^r etnitnmnnl,, Both the above officials recognise as the frontier the line laid down tm S^ioh k-AYAL ojmcsR, P^HSlAfcl GULF, t EMJAiL-2- down in tiie Turoo«-P6rsian Boundry Conuni a si o n 1 3 report, 4. Since no question of rights has arisen and since the present system of working at A'batian appears eminently satisfactory I think it would \)e most ixn injudicious to take any action to interfere with the smooth working of a difficult undertaking, I am personally satisfied that no British or Iraci rights in the Shatt-el-Ara'b are being called in question and I therefore feel that it would be most unwise for me t© take any dki^fxautidk official steps in such a matter. Suoh steps could only lead to the breaking down of the present working arrangements at Abakan and I am sure that the Customs Administration could and wuld while remaining strictly with*- in their rights retaliate in no uncertain manner to the great detriment of British trade. I might also point out that Iraq Customs officials were permitted to remain on a Russian steamer while she was in Persian waters at Mohaauaerah and tha the Persians have so far raised no objection. Thus the whole position appears to be one of mutual agreement and reciprocity which it would be a pity to destroy. no ease could I take any official steps in this matter without a reference to the Political Resident, to whom 1 am sending a copy of this letter* In conclusion I would respectfully add that in I hare the honour to be Sir.

WITH reference to the letter from this Department of the 28th March, I am directed by Lord Passfield to transmit to you, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Henderson, copies of a despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq, and of a letter to the Admiralty regarding the survey carried out by the Director of the Port of Basra of the Persian and Iraq coast lines in the estuary of the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. Lord Passfield would be glad to be furnished, in due course, with any observations Mr. Henderson may have to make and with his views as to the reply to be returned to paragraph 6 of Sir Gilbert Clayton's despatch. 3. Copies of this correspondence have been sent to the India Office and Air Ministry. I am, &amp;c. O. G. R. WILLIAMS. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Sir G. Clayton to Lord Pass field. (Secret A.) My Lord, Bagdad, July 22, 1929. I HAVE the honour to invite a reference to Mr. Amery's despatch Secret A, dated the 28th March, 1929, regarding the Perso-Iraq frontier in the estuary of the Shatt-al-Arab. 2. In accordance with the requirements set out in that despatch, the Director of the Port of Basra has carried out a survey of the Persian and Iraq coast lines at low-water spring tides. The work has been impeded by climatic conditions and the plotting of the Bahmanshir entrance is still in progress, but although the survey is therefore not entirely complete, the results already obtained provide the evidence required for examination of the immediate problem. The results of the survey are shown in a special survey chart, dated the 7th July, 1929, which I am forwarding to your Lordship separately by air mail. 3. The position revealed by the survey is unexpected and two important facts have emerged. The first is that practically the whole area of the Abdullah (Iraq) and the Abadan (Persia) flats are dry at low-water spring tides. As is shown clearly on the chart, these flats have a definite low-water line and do not dry in patches only. This is at variance with the assumption generally taken up in the correspondence which accompanied Mr. Amery's despatch under reply. Under the definition contained in paragraph 3 of Foreign Office letter, dated the 14th March, 1929, i.e., that the base-line for the determination of the limit of territorial waters is the line of mean low-water spring tides, the flats are to be regarded as territory. The suggestion that the whole of the Rooka Channel is in the open sea must, it appears to me, be abandoned. 4. The second point is that the survey shows that both the Abdullah and the Abadan flats have shifted considerably from the positions in which they were charted in the cutting from Admiralty Chart No. 1235, which accompanied the despatch under reply. The Abdullah flat (which, according to the previous paragraph, may be regarded as Iraq territory) has extended almost into the main stream and nearer the Rooka Channel, whereas the Persian territory—the Abadan flat—has receded from the Rooka Channel. Three-mile radii drawn from the extremity of the dry area of each of the two flats as now charted meet one another about half-way up the channel, and the channel itself is roughly about equi-distant from the two land extremities throughout its length. As to the precise territorial and geographical conclusions to be drawn from the data now available, I do not feel qualified to give an opinion. Both the Persian Government and the Iraq Government would appear [884 y—1]A. 2 to have equal rights to control the channel, and the complex problems and difficulties which arise thereby could only be solved satisfactorily by the appointment of the proposed International Conservancy Board to control the navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab and the Rooka Channel. 5. I forward with this despatch a copy of a brief report* by the Port Director containing a historical summary of the changes which have occurred in the estuary, from which he draws the conclusion that the course of the stream is veering and will in all probability be finally diverted to the Rooka Channel itself. I am sending to your Lordship with the new survey chart a copy of the chartst : (1) Plan No. 5; (2) Admiralty Chart No. 1253; and (3) plan showing dredged channel, referred to by Colonel Ward in his report. 6. I have not communicated the results of the survey or any of the information contained in the report or this despatch to the Iraq Government, and I request that your Lordship will inform me in due course of the information which I should com municate to them to supplement the particulars contained in my letter of the 9th April, 1929, to the Prime Minister, stating that His Britannic Majesty's Government required further information before reaching an opinion as to the position of the Rooka Channel. I forwarded a copy of this letter with my secret despatch dated the 10th April, 1929. 7. In sending forward the new survey, I would bring to your notice the fact that it represents 660 miles of soundings carried out as an urgent measure, with respite. The climatic conditions were hot and unpleasant, and the officers concerned were heavily handicapped by a series of severe and heavy dust-storms. I have informed the Port Director that I consider that the rapid accomplishment of the task reflects great credit upon the officers concerned. I have, &amp;c.

I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit herewith, for yonr information, copy of a letter of even date and number addressed to the Colonial Office. I am, &amp;c. O. MURRAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Admiralty to Colonial Office. (Confidential.) Sir, Admiralty, October 2, 1929. I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to your letter of the 21st August regarding the survey carried out by the Director of the Port of Basra of the Persian and Iraq coastlines in the estuary of the Shatt-el-Arab, and to request that the following observations may be put before the Secretary of State for the Colonies :— 2. The results of this survey are of great importance as regards the control of the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab and the Rooka Channel. As it is evident that the Abdulla and Abadan banks must now be regarded as territory and the 3-mile limit measured from them, the Rooka Channel is for a considerable portion of its length within Persian territorial waters, unless the starting-point of the frontier between Iraq and Persia as fixed by the Delimitation Commission can be ignored and the text of the 1913 protocol taken as the overriding authority as regards this point. My Lords consider that, by thus insisting on the text of the protocol, a strong case could be put up for maintaining that the dividing-line between Iraq and Persian waters should be drawn at right angles to the general trend of the low-water line along the Persian coast east of the extreme point of the Abadan bank, and a line drawn across the mouth of the river from the extreme end of the Abadan bank to the extreme end of the Abdullah bank. Such a dividing-line would, with the present position of the banks, put the whole of the Rooka Channel outside Persian waters. This would also have the advantage of preventing Persia from making a protest against the dredging of the Rooka Channel in her waters without her consent. 3. Persia might, however, argue, and would get some support from the replies of various countries to the League of Nations questionnaire on territorial waters, that she had a right to measure a 3-mile limit from the island now formed at Jow water off the Abadan bank and close to the Rooka Channel. This country has, however, always opposed such claims. 4. Although the general tendency of the changes in these banks has been in favour of Iraq, my Lords consider that, in view of their shifting nature, it is inadvisable to agree to any definite division of the waters based on their positions, and that it would be better for Iraq to claim the whole of the navigable river, wherever that may happen to be, on the ground of the text of the 1913 protocol and the practical necessities of the situation. 5. From the British point of view, the peculiar difficulties of the position in respect of territorial jurisdiction might perhaps be used as arguments, from the opposing points of view, to get Persia and Iraq to agree to a tripartite agreement in which this country should participate. 6. My Lords concur in the proposal in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply to express appreciation of the manner in which, and the speed with which, the survey has been carried out. 7. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Foreign Office, India Office and x \ir Ministry. I am, &amp;c. ALEX. FLINT.

Sir, Foreign Office, November 5, 1929 I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to request you to inform Lord Passfield that he has had under consideration your letter of the 21st August and the letter addressed to the Colonial Office by the Admiralty on the 2nd October, regarding the results of the recent survey of the Persian and Iraq coastline in the estuary of the Shatt-el-Arab, and to transmit to you the accompanying copies of minutes by the legal advisers to the Foreign Office on the subject. 2. In considering these minutes, reference should be made to the chart cutting prepared by the Admiralty at the request of this Department, showing the frontier line according to the Turco-Persian Frontier Protocol of 1913, the low water line of the Abadan and Abdullah banks, as determined by the latest survey, and the 3-mile limits as measured from the ends of these banks, of which it is understood a copy has been furnished to the Colonial Office. 3. There appears to be a strong case for considering (a) that the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab is a line joining the extreme end of the Abdullah bank and the extreme end of the Abadan bank close to the North Beacon (and a little east of it); and {b) that the Iraq-Persian frontier runs down the low water mark on the south-west side of the Abadan bank, as far as the extreme end of the bank, close to North Beacon. It seems, therefore, that the Iraqi Government can justifiably treat the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, down to the imaginary line joining the extreme ends of the Abdullah and Abadan banks, as national waters. Should a dispute arise with Persia on this point, the Iraqi Government could certainly maintain the contentions set forth in the opening sentence of this paragraph. It is, however, evidently in the interests alike of His Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government that such a dispute should be avoided. 4. As regards the Rooka Channel, it will be observed from the first enclosure herein that it could reasonably be contended that the channel lies wholly within Iraq territorial waters. Owing, however, to the fact that there is no generally recognised principle of international law governing the limitation of the territorial waters of two riparian States at the mouth of a river, such a claim might well be contested by Persia. Should disagreement arise on the point and the case be submitted to arbitration, the result could not be predicted with certainty. Mr. Henderson, therefore, considers that the importance of avoiding a dispute with I ersia on this point is still greater than in the case of the questions dealt with in the preceding' paragraph of this letter. , t 5. In Mr. Henderson's view, the risk of such disputes can best be met by the establishment of the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board, on which Persia would be represented. I am, therefore, to suggest for the consideration of Lord Passfield that the Acting High Commissioner at Bagdad should be instructed, in reply to paragraph 6 of the late Sir G. Clayton s despatch, Secret, A, of the 22nd July, to lay stress upon this aspect of the matter in any communication which Major Young may be instructed to make to the Iraqi Government on this subject. ' 6. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty and the India Office. T O TY-J Aro ttttt r^rrvfr*pnl nf 1q18 is. of course, the governing instrument with regard to the MONTE AGLE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Beckett. [959 e—1]Commission was wrong and should be reversed. But I do not think it is necessary to do this. The Delimitation Commission stopped or began their delimitation of the frontier at the point 2 miles below the fort marked with an arrow on the last Admiralty plan. The frontier below that point has not been delimited at all. It may be that changes in the configuration of the banks have occurred since that time, with the result that more land has been created, or it may be that the commission, since they only visited the district at high water, made a mistake and did not carry their delimitation as far seaward as they should. But I do not think it matters which, since we can maintain now not that any of the work of delimitation which the^ did was wrong and should be changed, but that there is now a piece of frontier which they have not delimited at all. We are not, therefore, contesting any of the delimitation which they actually did, but merely maintaining that it was not quite complete, and this seems to me to be an entirely different thing, and there is nothing inconsistent with article 5 of the protocol in such a contention. Consequently, we can now say that as regards the undelimited portion, the matter is governed simply by the protocol, and its terms are the only thing which can be applied to ascertain the boundary on this lowest portion. It is clear now% as the result of the survey, that the land must be regarded as going to the end of the Abadan bank and Abdullah bank, respectively, and that a line drawn across between the ends of these two banks must be regarded as being the mouth of the river and the point where national waters stop and territorial waters begin. The references to low waters marked on p. 10 show that the protocol itself contemplated that a low water mark must be taken for ascertaining territory on this boundary, or, in other words, that the ordinary principles of international law must in this respect be adopted. We have, therefore, in respect of this piece of undelimitated frontier, to apply the words of the protocol, which provide that ' the frontier follows the course of the Shatt-el-Arab to the sea, leaving the river and all the islands therein under Ottoman sovereignty on the following conditions and with the following exceptions ' For the reasons given above, we have to apply that principle as far as the land at low water mark goes, and that now takes us on the left bank of the river, at any rate as far as North Beacon, and, for the reasons which I will give later, I think that North Beacon is the point which must be taken as being the end of the land. The frontier, therefore, follows the low water mark of the Abadan bank down as far as North Beacon, where the land and the river end and w T e meet the open sea, the whole of the river as far as this point being now Iraq national waters. Though there may be no definite rule laid down, it does seem to be reasonable to say that, for the purpose of ascertaining the boundary between Persian and Iraq territorial waters outside the mouth of the river, one should draw a line joining the extreme ends of the Abdullah and Abadan banks, and then draw another line from the end of the Abadan bank, following the general lie of the coast, and that the boundary between the two territorial waters would be the line which bisects in two equal parts the obtuse angle formed at the junction of these two lines. At any rate, this would be a reasonable contention, and it is one which would clearly put the whole of the Rooka Channel in Iraq territorial waters. There is, of course, the islet which appears at low water south-east of North Beacon, an islet which is not, even at low water, joined to the Abadan Island. I have marked this islet ' X ' on the Admiralty chart. The Admiralty point out that if the matter is governed purely by the ordinary rules of international law, Persia would find some support from the replies of the various countries to the League of Nations questionnaire in maintaining that this islet X is Persian territory, and that her territorial waters must be measured from it. Whether or not that contention would be good if the matter were left to be decided purely according to the rules of general international law, it seems to me to be unnecessary to go into that now for two reasons:— (1.) In this case the matter is not left to be governed by the ordinary rules of international law, since the protocol itself contains provisions as to the principles to be supplied. I refer to letter (a) 3, on p. 10, which provides : ' All islets which now exist, or which, though not now in existence, may be formed, and which may be joined at low water to the Island of Abadan, belong to Persia.' It is clear, therefore, that the protocol itself has provided that in the case of islets off the Abadan Island, Persia shall only be able to claim those islets wdiich are joined to the Island of Abadan at low water, and that, therefore, she cannot claim this islet X. It will be seen also that the same principle is adopted in letter {c), which</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000256_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/624</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000256</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/624</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 82/17 I (F 90) A.P.O.C.
