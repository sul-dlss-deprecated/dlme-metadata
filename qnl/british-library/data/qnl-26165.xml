POLITICAL Department. Please see the note at P.Z. 8762/36 about the payment ef certain water plant, etc., which was taken over from the Perim Coal Company v/hen the Company evacuated the Island. It was explained in that minute that certain capital expenditure which will ultimately he home hy Aden Colony revenues, would have to he home temporarily as a charge on Indian revenues, since Aden Colony revenues do not come into existence until 1st April. The present submission concerns a minor item of capital expenditure in this class. Owing to the withdrawal of Cable and Wireless Ltd. , from the Island as a result of the withdrawal of the Coal Company, it has been necessary to secure a wireless set to maintain communication between Aden and the Island. This wireless set^ which,^»*i4!Wfc*«&lt;^ j costs £237*11.0, has been provided by the Air Ministry who have now presented their bill. It is proposed to treat this sum in the same way as the £ 2,000 for water plant, etc., viz. to authorise the Accountant-General at this Office to transfer the amount to the Air Ministry and to enter it inter the account current with India. The Government of India will be informed that this has been done and requested to adjust the charge direct with Aden as a part of the numerous minor financial adjustments which have to be made at the time of separation. The proposal thus merely involved a temporary charge on Indian revenues for a matter of a couple of months or so. As was explained in the minute on P.

I am also sending, as you asked, a note in receipt form to the Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, specifying in full the items covered by the amount in question. This transaction, as you rightly say, marks the finish of long and protracted negotiations in connection with my Company's evacuation of Perim with the exception, I believe, of a few small local accounts collectable in Aden: it has all been very sad work pulling down a structure which has been built up with much cost and thought, and may I in my turn tender you my thanks for the assistance given. I am quite sure that our original request to cease tenancy must have created a certain amount of difficulty of procedure.1//is subject loom roii/irmation cm ,'creptonce unless otherwise sta/e,/anJt„our, f s','L tc/Mu/ Uar.S/n/e, etc. clauses.

Draft letter to Mr.Graham Wallis notifying arrangements made and thanking him forMinute Paper political Department Sanction for the termination of the Perim Coal Company’s lease and for the putting into effect of the arrangements consequent upon the Company’s evacuation was given on P.Z. 4502/36 (Flags), P.Z. 5108/36 (Flag C) and P.Z.7280/36 (Flag E). 2.The arrangements in regard to expenditure resulting from the Company’s evacuation is that Indian Revenues should bear finally recurrent expenditure up to April 1st 1937 when Aden becomes a Crown colony and that Aden Colony revenues, when these are available, will bear recurrent expenditure after that date and all capital expenditure whether before or after it. In regard to the lump sum of Rs.96,000, which has been paid by the Company in consideration of the premature termination of its lease, 73 ~-ths will eventually be credited to Aden Colony revenues oo 1 ^ when these come into existence, ~-ths being credited to 88 Indian revenues. In the meantime, of course, the whole Rs.96,C00 is being kept by India. 3. One item of the capital expenditure which has been ■jL sanctioned by the Treasury and Colonial Office for eventual disbursement from Aden Colony revenues is £2,000 in respect of water plant which is being bought from the Company with effect from 31st December 1936. It had been hoped that this sum could have been paid over in Aden (where the lump sum of Rs.96,C00 was paid over by the Company), but unfortunately the Company have now closed down their business in Aden and they want to be paid their £2,000 in London. 4. The matter is only one of accounting machinery, and the final adjustment between Indian and Colonial revenues will be made in due course at Aden, but in the meantime authority is required for the Accountant-General to/ 4795 5000 5/:t6' to pay out £2,000 to the Perim Coal Company on December &lt;Jr 31st 1936. Sanction is accordingly requested^on^ the7 underatanding that this is merely an interim payment on hehalf of Aden Colonial revenues and in viow of^the— that Indian revenues at Aden have already received a much larger sum which is eventually to be credited to Colonial revenues and against which the £2,000 will be adjusted. 5. It will be desirable to inform the Company of the arrangements made and a draft d.o. letter to the Company is submitted for this purpose. In view of the fact that this is the last occasion on which we are likely to have to write to the Company, it is submitted that seme expression A4 of thanks from the Secretary of State should be conveyed A to Mr.Graham Wallis for the very great assistance which he has given to us over this business. Mr.Graham Wallis has done everything in his power to see that the change over at Perim effected with the least possible difficulty to Government and he has been exceedingly patient during the delays inseparable from negotiating on a matter in which several Government Departments are concerned.

WARDLEY (Treasury). 5th Will you please refer to our letter of the 15th of August* and your reply of the 20th of August, No. S. 24222/2f, regarding the future arrangements at Perim? It was stated in paragraph 4 of our letter that His Majesty's Government's prior sanction would be sought before the expenditure was incurred and I now write to send you the information which we have received both as to the initial expenditure and the recurring expenditure. this has come in the form of a letter^ from the Acting Chief Commissioner to the Secretary of State for India, a copy of which I enclose. At one stage we were not quite clear how the figures were made up, but it is clear from the latest telegraphic correspond ence with the Government of India and Aden that the figures given in this letter are correct. You have had some of the telegrams from the India Office, but I am not sure that they have sent you them all. In effect we have, I think, already to a great extent obtained Treasury concurrence in regard to this, since you will remember that you concurred in the despatch of India Office telegram No. 2157 of the 22nd July§. This authorized the Chief Commissioner to put the proposals into effect. Everyone is agreed that it would be a good arrangement to purchase the water condensing plant and its accessories for £2,000 and we should therefore like to let the Company know as soon as possible that this is agreed to. It is now proposed that the change over should take place on the 1st of October. The figure for 4 recurring expenditure can therefore be reduced to Rs.21,000 (round figures) for six months instead of the figure of Rs.24,730 for seven months. The initial expendi ture you will see amounts to Rs.35,000 (in round figures). This latter sum includes the cost of the purchase of the water condensing plant and accessories. I notice one point, namely, that under recurring expenditure there is provision for the purchase of coal. This will, of course, have to be purchased in the future, but you will remember that the offer of Mr. Graham Wallis to sell the nominated plant for £2,000 included the stock of coal now remaining on the island—see paragraph 6 of his letter to Clauson of the 15th July||. We will remind the Chief Commissioner of this. We should like now to be able to say as soon as possible that we agree to all these arrangements, so perhaps you can let me have a line at an early date to say that the Treasury concur.

Dear Clarke, I enclose a copy of a note regarding the cable station at Periia, and a copy of a letter dated 11th oepteiaber, from Cable and Wireless Ltd* If you agree, it seems desirable to oircul&amp;te these papers to the members of the Imperial Communications Committee with a view to the early consideration of the question whether the maintenance of the cable depot at lerim is of importance from the defence point of view, and if so, whether Cable and Vireless Ltd should be informed accordingly. As Perim (which is of course part of Aden for administrative purposes) is being transferred to iUM.G. on 1st April,1937, the present question is not of very close concern to the India Office. But, in view of the fact that the island is still part of British India, we have to deal with matters arising in connection with it until the 1st April next. The financial arrangements in regard to Perim are that until ^pril 1st 1937, when Aden is transferred to H.id.C., Indian revenues bear all recurrent expenditure but that all capital expenditure up to April 1st as well as all capital and recurrent expenditure after April 1st, will be borne on the revenues of the new Colony of Aden.

Vvww &lt;A The Island of Perim has in the A past been ran almost entirely by the Perim Coal Co. (Lambert Bros, of London), which for many years has maintained a coaling station on the island. The Company has ran the water sapply, an electric light sapply, an ice plant, water condensers and medical facilities. The i anager of the Company has been the official administrator of the island, onder the control of the Resident and Chief Commissioner, Aden. The Asiatic Petroleam Co. have also had an oiling station on the island, and Cable and Wireless have maintained a cable station. There has also been a Lloyd's signal station. Por all these ^ concerns the Perim Coal Co. has acted as agent. Owing to sabstantial losses over a term of years, the Perim Coal Co. has had to wind ap its basiness, and is leaving the island on 1st October, 1936. There have been prolonged discassions with the Company leading ap to this conclasion, and it had been onderstood that all the commercial concerns, inclading Cable and Wireless, were going to leave the island entirely. Cable and Wireless' wrote a letter to the Imperial Commonicat ions Advisory Committee on 5th Aagast, 1936, making 'formal application to cease working at and to close its Perim branch'/© branch'. It is understood that the effect would merely be that the Sheikh Seyd cable connection would be permanently joined through at Perim and would work direct to Aden. As a result of the withdrawal of the Perim Coal Co. it will be necessary for Government to maintain minimum essential services to provide for the small amount of life (consisting of lighthouse keepers and a small village) still left on the island. Arrangements have accordingly been made for water supply, medical facilities and telegraphic communication ai Aden by means of a small wireless set. It has also been agreed that the Superintendent of the small 'V/ii police force in the island should be given certain administrative powers, and that regular visits of inspection should be paid to the island an official Aden. In the light of the arrangements which Government are making, Cable and Wireless^ have apparently reconsidered their position, and feel that they migjrt be able, while closing their actual cable station on the island, to maintain their small repair depot and cable tanks. It is understood that about 80 miles of cable are kept at Perim, and that it is a most useful centre for cable repairs, being the only place for the purpose between Suez and Mombasa. Their difficulty is that hitherto the Perim Coal Co. has done all their business for themas their agents, and if they maintain the depot they will have to have a staff consisting of a foreman and five or six semi-skilled men, and arrangements will have to be made for supervision of these men and for the supply of water and accommodation. In this connection Cable and ireless have raised the question whether H.h.G. are interested in the maintenance of the tanks and depot from the defence point of view. In their letter of 11th September, which is circulated herewith, they state the points at issue. The India Office is in communication with the Aden authorities in regard to the provision of facilities to the Company to enable them to maintain the depot temporarily, pending a final decision as to its permanent retention or abandonment. kb hJ* Q- (a^h h It is now desired to ascertain from the Committee whether Cable and tireless should be informed that h.L.G. regard the retention of the depot as an important defence requirement or not. if the former, it is no doubt possible that the Company will then raise the question of some sort of contribution in cash or in kind (e.g., the provision of free water, etc.) by Government^ ^ im cue t? • cayIk hi**} ,r'' (3 THIS IHDEftTURE is made the day of October 1936 between THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN COUNCIL OP INDL,.

I will now explain the it-ems above. Item, (a) The Government Agent, Perim, informs me that there is transport water to Police and Lighthouse establishments by camels instead of at contract rate @ Re.1/8/- per 100 gallons. The former method appears to be cheaper and the present contractor is not well spoken of by the Government Agent. Item (d). This is for the purchase of office, furniture from the Perim Coal Company. Item (f). Colonel Phipson, the Civil Administrative Medical Officer, Aden, is of opinion that medical facilities should be abandoned in the Concession and transferred to Meyun at the Quarantine Hospital. A building exists but it requires re-roofing, alterations and repairs. Item (g). A Clerk will be absolutely necessary to maintain and check the water Accounts and stores. sufficient coal to be salved in the harbour to last for many years. All that is required is a small dredging barge which is there. This could be worked by the Tug crew who will not have much to do. Items (b)(c) (e)(j) &amp; (k). It is proposed to make arrangements toItem (h). An additional Sweeper is necessary, as a certain number of inhaoitants have their homes in the Concession area and no accommodation exists for them in Meyun village. Item (i).

It ip understood that the necessary arrangements or tue nayment of the lump sum by the Perim Coal Company on October 1st will be made by the ousting Chief Comissioner at.

Claueon The Foreippi oecretary to the Government of India, orei{ 7 i and Political UeDartment. SI^U.I am -by MrJ Secretary Ormsby G-ore to refer to your letter (No. P.Z.4502/36) of the 23rd July regarding the future arrangements at the Island of Perim, in which you enquire whether the Secretary of State for the Colonies concurs in the Government of India*s proposals for determining the incidence of expenditure between Imperial and Indian revenues, as set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 of their letter of the i 13th of January, 1936, to the Secretary of State for India. 2. In reply, I am to state that after consultation with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, Mr. Ormsby Gore concurs in the proposals of the Government of India, which in effect are as Hows (a) Lump sum payment by the Perim Coal Company. The division of this sum is to be made in THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, INDIA OFFICE. proportionproportion to the period of tenure of each party, that is to say, the Government of India will receive 15/88 of the lump sum payment, fifteen months hieing the period from the 1st January, 1936, to 31st March, 1937, during which the Government of India will remain responsible for the administration in Perim, and 88 months being the period from 1st January, 1936, up to the date on which the lease would normally have terminated. (b) Recurrent Expenditure. , The Government of India is to accept liability for recurrent expenditure up to the date of transfer, on the understanding that His Majesty T s Government’s contribution for police expenditure will continue unaffected. (c) Initial Expenditure. His Majesty’s Government is to accept entire liability for initial expenditure. 3. These arrangements have been agreed to by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury on the understanding that the expenditure chargeable against His Majesty’s GovernmentGovernment under these proposals will 'be a charge on the budget of the new Colony of Aden when it comes into existence, the Colony receiving the share of the lump sum payment by the Perim Coal Company apportioned to His Majesty’s Government. 4. Their Lordships also assume that, notwithstanding the delay that has occurred in the departure of the Perim Coal Company, it is still the intention to regard the lease as having been terminated on the 1st of January, 1936, for the purpose of calculating the lump sum payment by the Company. As a result of semi-official discussion **» with your Department, the Company have been asked whether they agree that the original arrangement should stand, and it is noted that Mr. Graham Wallis, in his letter to Mr. Clauson of the 9th of September, has stated that his Company agree that the amount payable in final discharge of the lease shall be deemed to be Rs. 96,000 as at the 1st January, 1936, and that any payments of rent which have been made since that date shall be considered as having been paid on account of that amount.

The poeltlon f of cour«e f 1» that the Perim Coal Company # who hare in the paet practically run the 1 eland, are closing down, and the Aaiatio Petroleum Company are also moving their station. In these circumstance* Cable and tfirelee* had come to the conclusion that they would not be justified in keeping their station at Perim, and had decided to close it down when the Coal Company left. They h«d written to t »e Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, requesting the necessary formal permission to do so. The Company, however, find that Government are going to keep up essential services in the island »nd it has therefore occurred to then that, although the actual cable station nt Perlm mu^t be closed down, it might be possible for them to maintain the small depdt and the l^rge cable tanka which they h^ve at present maintained there. The tanks contain «*bout 80 miles of cable and the island is a very convenient spot for repairing the important cables which go down the Red Sea to Africa, India, etc. The object of l?r.Wood’s and Ifr.White’s call was to explain this and to make two enquiries:* (1) Wh«t Is H.tf.G.’s interest, if any, in this matter from the point of view of defence (2) Could H.II.G. assist with facilities if the depdt is maintained 9 Ae regards (l) they pointed out that It would be particularly advantageous in time of war to have this convenient depdt at Perim, and indeed that it would detract very considerably from the efficiency of the was present. The future arrsnrer.ente ^firrsn^ement8 for cable maintenance (a Tital defence requirement) if the depdt were to be »hut down and the sable tanks abandoned.^? They felt they were entitled attitude waa frees the commercial point of view, i. e. wViether the CoR;pruiy would wish in any caee to keep this depot for pe^ce time requirements. Their attitude, however, wae that the Company could not a# yet foresee whether it would be a feasible proposition financially or not, ~nd they could not say whether they would keep up the depot or not until they knew what H.tf.S.'s attitude was as regards the defence aspect. ke regards (2), It was explained to them th«t the Government would in future be providing the island with a water supply, medical requirements, minimum administration (i.e. an Inspector of Police or the like with re^ul^r visits by a higher official from Aden) and a squad of police. There should, therefore, be no difficulty in providing Cable and Wireless with the necessary water for their tanks end with such medical attention as was required. They r^lso mentioned the fret that the Perim Coal Co'.prtny has in the past acted as the agent of Cable and wireless, and has run the depdt and tanks for them. They thought, however, they would be able to run the place in future with s foreman and five or six workmen, *nd they asked whether it would be probable that the semi skilled workmen pt present employed for this purpose by the Perim Coal Company, would still be available. They also asked whether it would be po«aible for any of the light of defence requirements. to ask wh*t H.Tf.G.’o attitude to the matter was in the They were, of course, asked vh«*t the Company’s Government/Government employeee in the leiend in future to eupervi«e thie eteff. It wee agreed that in the firat place the India Cffice would send a tele#r?»a to the acting Chief Comraissioner, Aden, aekln^ whether it would, in fact, be possible to arrange for the facilities (water, semi- skilled staff, supervision) which would be essential if the Company was to be able to stay at all, snd th«t if arrangements bould be m^de they should be made on a temporary ba^le, so thnt the depdt could be maintained for the present pending a financial decision as to the future, Thle decision will be taken by the Company In consultation with H.U.G. in the light of the Intter’s interest from the point of view of defence requirements. l?th ''epterober 1936,—/ Lambert Brothers L td Telegraphic Address. “LAMBERT LONDON' Telephone.

(o . It seems to me now that the only outstanding point is that Cables and Wireless have not yet received the formal permission to cease telegraph operations which has been applied for from the Government Committee, but perhaps you could, as you suggest, get in touch with the requisite department to see if this could be hurried along, but of course as the two Lloyds signalmen can still be made available they will not withdraw from the Telegraph Service until your wireless set is fully functioning, and I take it that if you are getting the loan of a temporary one this is now in course of erection and should be ready. r As mentioned on the telephone our Manager, Mr. Pape, who, as youLAMBERT BROTHERS, limited.

GW/MGA regarding the future arrangements at Perim. 1 understand from our telephone conversation that you would be glad to have this week information about the Asiatic Petroleum Company's tanks and about the position regarding the Company’s water supply plant held at Government's disposal. As regards the Asiatic Company's tanks you may take it definitely that the company are at liberty to do whatever they please with these tanks. As regards the water supply plant you are, l think, really anxious to know whether Government wish to take this plant over permanently (payment for it to be set off against the other items in the final settlement between Government and the Comr^n-y-)—or wiah--mer^r±^—to ’I/utitiw it f ENCLOSURE IN Am MAIL LETTER aharn Wallis, Esq., * No 3 ft ' vtP fcr/ Messrs.

The offer which you make in your letxer of the 15th July to sell outright the whole of the plant specified in paragraph 4 of my letter of 25th February 1936, is at present under consideration by the interested authorities, I hope that a decision may oe reached shortly and the present indications are that Government will probably wish to buy this, plant. 1 am sorry that it is not possible to say anything more definite at the moment. As regards the other points dealr with in 5 /our 1 Btter&gt; the suggestion of the local authorities is tha'c the Company should hand over to Government on 1st September.

This dace will* o_i. course^ covei A&gt; 3 and D in paragraph 4 of your letter. As regards 0 (Communications) it appears from our telegram irom Aden that the local authorities are in touch with the local Cable and Wireless representatives. It appears that the Chief/3 .

The necessary staff now at Perim are willing to remain, I consider 2,000 pounds sterling a reasonable price for plant if it includes (? all,, above accessories but port engineer, who has examined the plant,, is of the opinion that estimate of cost given in Appendix 1 of letter C-1045 of November 16th, 1935, is excessive and was based on Perim Coal Company book values and that one condensing plant with tanks is not worth more than 300 pounds sterling. The second-hand equipment which I anticipate it may be desirable to purchase from the Company is surgical instruments and appliances for dispensaries and equipment for the rest house. As regards the motor-car it will probably be better to purchase one in Aden, Dharam Singh, present Perim Coal Company assistant surgeon, is willing to remain at Perim and I propose, subject to your approval, to regain him temporarily and to consider his permanent retention later.

Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty. linoth 24 J 1)11936 5000 5.36 As I mentioned to yqu over the tela phone^yesterda^ a point has arisen in connection with the termination of the Perim Coal Company’s lease as to the disposal of the tanks (two 8,000- tons and one 400-ton) owned by the Asiatic Petroleum Company who hold a sub-lease from the Perim Coal Company. I enclose the relevant portion of a letter from Mr. Graham Wallis of the Perim Coal Company. Y/e should be glad to know whether the Admiralty are interested in the fate of these tanks. As our lease with the Peu'i m Coal Company is being terminated by mutual consent, our Legal Department have advised that any arrangement whereby these tanks would become the property of Government would be a matter for negotiation between Government and the Perim Coal Company, and would be included in the terms upon which the lessee, in this case the Perim Coal Company, is being excused from the remainder of the term of his lease. The Aden Government have stated, however, that they have no use for these tanks, and, unless therefore the Admiralty are interested, we do not/ 4794not propose to raise the point and shall merely inform the Perim Coal Company that the Asiatic Petroleum Company are at liberty to do what they please with their tanks. It is conceivable that the Asiatic Petroleum Company have already approached the Admiralty in the matter; and it seems to me that if you should decide that you are interested in these tanks, it would be preferable for the Admiralty to come to some arrange ment direct with the Asiatic Petroleum Company rather than to negotiate in a roundabout way via the India Office and the Perim Coal Company. I shall be most grateful if you could send me an answer as soon as possible as the Perim Coal Company are pressing for a decision in the matter.

In connection with the termination of the Perim Coal Company^ lease, a question has arisen as to the rights of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, who hold a sub-lease from the Perim Coal Company, to remove their plant. The A.P.C. have installed two 8,000 ton tanks which they are anxious to destroy as they fear that if they leave them intact they might be taken over at some future date by some rival firm. Incidentally they have tried to dispose of the tanks, but have failed. These tanks cost between £10,000 and £15,000 each to instal and it seems a criminal waste to destroy them in this wilful fashion. However, the Aden Government have no use for them and the only possible user would appear to be the Admiralty who have probably already been approached by A.P.C. We cannot, however, approach the Admiralty in the matter until we are certain of our own rights in the question. By the terms of their lease with the perim Coal Company, A.P.C. have apparently the right to remove their buildings and erections as against the Perim Coal Company (see section 6 of the Lease between the Perim Coal Company and A.P.C. flagged in the bound volume attached) but their rights as against Government are somewhat obscure. The clause referred to is subject to the terms and conditions of clauses 2(e) and 3(d) of perim Coal Company's Lease with H.M.G. The latter clause appears to be exclusively concerned with the eventuality of Government giving notice to apply to the present case. Clause 2 (a&lt;) t s&gt; (e), however, ! might perhaps be applicable in the present situation if these tanks could be included in the expression 'erections 1 '. vV / P.Z.5108/36 Cunard House gw/nga 8S,Leadenhall St., London,E.C. 3. 15th July,1936. Dear ICr.Clauson, I beg to refer to* the Meeting which took place at the India Office yesterday afternoon, the 14th instant, at which there were also present Sir Bernard Reilly and the Colonial Office Representative. iny Company had received from the Asiatic Petroleum Company of their intention to cease their operations at Perim at the earliest possible moment, subject to a definite agreement as to the manner in which they may dispose of their tanks. The understanding of both my Company and the Asiatic Petroleum Company is that in accordance with the Agreements in existence which were sanctioned by the India Office,the oil tanks definitely remain the property of the Asiatic Petroleum Company and,as advised, they very naturally in closing down their services desire to render them unfit for use by anybody who possibly at a later date may be attracted to the Island. consulted and a confirmation of this point passed to us at the earliest possible opportun The Meeting then proceeded to discuss the following points, which in effect are all more or less interwoven:- The first point discussed v/as the intimation that It was agreed that the Legal Department should be A Date on which Government will take over the working of the plant which my Company has agreed to temporarily hold at Governments disposal during the transition stage Date on which Government will take over possession and/c and/or maintainance o£ the harbour moorings,lights and beacons. Date on which Government will be ready with their own means of communications as it is desired to close down the existing cable communications at the earliest possible moment Date on which my Company T s Manager,Mr. John Pape. could be relieved of his duties as Government Agent. I understand that so far no provisional arrangements whatever have been made in connection v/ith Points A. and C. out in your letter P.Z.705/36, dated 35th February,1936, Paragraph 4, and I pointed out that I did not feel it was reasonable to be asked to hold this indefinitely at Government * s disposal, and that if Government wrere going to take over and man this plant a definite period, say not exceeding three months, should be agreed, so as to enable me to take adequate steps for its ultimate disposal. connection with this plant, namely that if it would facilitate Governments calculations my Company would be prepared to sell outright the whole of this nominated plant, including' the stock of coal now remaining on the Island for the use of the condensers, which I believe is estimated at something over 100 tons, for the sum of two thousand pounds sterling - , which offer I now beg to confirm. As suggested, I am quite willing that all this plant should be valued, if you so desire, upon the basis of a going concern at Perim. being paid in the ordinary way into the Treasury at Aden, and that it was our assumption that it would be in order You will remember that the plant agreed is set I put forward an alternative suggestion in I pointed out that our concession rental was still to/to continue doing this until such time as we vacated,and the balance of the consolidated rent would be then ascertained and paid, but if in accordance with Paragraph 2 of your above mentioned letter you prefer settlement made at once, then my Company will be quite willing to do so on the understanding of course that my Company's people y;ere allowed to remain until the final closing dOT/n: I believe that the date of 1st May, 1936 named in that Paragraph by you was mentioned because it coincided with the commencement date of the lease. With regard to your Paragraph 3 of the same letter in connection with delapidations, it was q&gt;ointed out that the reference to hire money therein was to be as a direct cancellation out against delapidations under clause S.D.to which I am prepared to agree, but the taking over of such plant is, 1 think, dealt with in the sale offer which I have now made to Government. With regard to Point B.,I explained that we expect shortly to know that the last mercantile steamer oakling will be in the early days of August, after which we do not propose to continue the lighting of the Harbour unless it is Government's wish that we shall do so as long as our stores and materials for lighting remain. With regardyfco C., an early intimation will be welcomed as to when the Government will be ready to be free of. .commercial means of communication, as it is now desired to withdraw the Lloyd's signalmen who attend to the cable duties, and here again we feel that we should not be asked to do this indefinitely, as there is now no cable revenue at all to warrant their remaining. I shall be glad if you will kindly let me have a reply to tne points raised at your earliest convenience, so that I can proceed with certain very necessary arrangements.

Since this a meeting has been held,which was attended by Sir Bernard Reilly, Mr. Graham Wallis of Perim Coal Company and representatives of the Colonial Office and India Office, to discuss various aspects of this X question. The main facts which emerged from this meeting were - (1) that Asiatic Petroleum Company had definitely decided to vacate the Island; (2) that Perim Coal Company will conclude its business on August 15th and therefore desire to hand over all essential Services, administrative, medical, communications and water supply, to Government as soon as possible after that date. It is therefore all the more urgent to send the proposed instructions tothe Government of India, and, in particular, it is desirable to stress the urgency of the question and to discover when Government will be in a position to take over the administration of the Island from 4424 5000 1/36 the Perim Coal Company. The draft telegram to the Government of India has been re-cast accordingly, but the basis of the telegram remains the same, i.e. that alternative 1 of the Chief Commissioner’s proposals of 16th November will be put into force.

As suggested, I am quite willing that all this plant should be valued, if you so desire, upon the basis of a going concern at Perim, was still being paid in the ordinary way into the Treasury at Aden, and that it was our assumption that it I put forward an alternative suggestion in I pointed out that our concession rental1// rjnnfrtf tons snlycci lo ourrou/irmnfton on arrrpfance unless otherwise statei/ nm! to mir usr/nl.

C) With regard to Point B., I explained that we expect shortly to know that the last mercantile steamer calling will be in the early days of August, after which we do not propose to continue the lighting of the Harbour unless it is Government's wish that we shall do so as long as our stores and materials for lighting remain.1// y»o/a/ions subject to ourrott/irmnlim, on rteceplance unless oi/terwise slufe,/on J to our usual. id of 6otl.

C n 5 u o u Department. Mr, Walton , I attach a draft record of the meeting held Ti* I' l yesterday, if salient point is perhaps that the Asiatic Petroleum Company have now definitely decided not to remain on the Island, and it is therefore all the more essential to issue instructions to the Government of India along the lines submitted at P.Z.4502/36. The draft telegram, however, requires recasting in certain aspects, and I have accordingly suggested a redraft. As the main basis remains the same, i.e. tbet the Chief Commissioner's proposals under alternative 1 of his letter of 16th November are to be put into effect, I don't think it is necessary to re-submit to Committee and Council; such delay would be most unfortunate as the whole question has now become rather urgent. The other points discussed at the meeting can be dealt with at leisure. The question of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's rights will be considered when the sub-Lease has been dug out of the E. &amp; 0. Department; whili the future arrangements for the water supply is primarily a matter for the Colonial Office and the Treasury.

Chief Commissioner^ letter of 16th November, 1935, No.C.1045, and Government of India’s Express Letter of 13th January, 1936. Future of Perim. It is now certain that no Companies will remain in the Island and Perim Coal Company are anxious to remove all their staff as soon as possible after August 15th. Chief \ ^ Commissioner may therefore be authorised to put into effect proposals under alternative 1 in his letter of 16th November; i.e. minimum Government Services without maintenance of harbour. 2. As regards water supply no final choice/ias yet been made between three alternatives suggested by Chief Commissioner, as H.M.G. are anxious not to incur capital expenditure at this juncture. It is therefore proposed as interim arrangement that Government should temporarily take Jru, *f chyi over from Company^he necessary plant mentioned in paragraph 18 of Chief Commissioner's letter of 16th November, rnwriino doniniun iio'*lo pgrnwmriint awnungeinwnUu.Department 2 . 3. It will be difficult to persuade Perim Coal Company or any of the subsidiary Companies to remain at Perim for any appreciable period after August 15th, and it is therefore desirable for Government to make urgent arrangements for taking over the essential Services under al'faernat4ve 1; i.e. administrative, medical, communications and interim water arrangement mentioned in paragraph 2 above. I should be glad to learn as soon as possible the earliest date upon which Government will be in a position to do this. 4. Separate instructions have already been sent to Commander-in-Chief East Indies regarding temporary maintenance of such essential harbour lights as may be required during continuance of present emergency. 5. Other points (e.g. incidence of expenditure and detailed arrangements with Perim Coal Company for determin ation of Lease) are being dealt with separately. Expenditure will of course have to be met in first instance from Indian Revenues, which would however in first instance be credited with lump sum payment from Company under present proposal for termination of Lease/FUTURE OF PERBl A meeting was held at the India Office on July 14th to discuss the various questions connected with the future arrangements of Perim. The following were present Sir Bernard Reilly Mr. Blaxter - Colonial Office Mr. Graham Wallis Lord Hood. Mr. Graham Wallis stated in the first instance that the Asiatic Petroleum Company had finally decided to leave Perim and that Cable &amp; Wireless and Lloyds would accordingly also both close down. In connection with the departure of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, a question had arisen in regard to their rights respecting their plant. Asiatic Petroleum Company have on the Island two 8,000-ton tanks and one 400-ton tank; the cost of installing the former was roughly between £10,000 and £15,000. Asiatic Petroleum Company have tried to dispose of these tanks but have failed, and were therefore anxious to destroy them before evacuating the Island, but /i#|' Out*i\ they were flewlafeiMl whether they were entitled to do so. It was agreed that the India Office should ascertain the legal rights of this question and discover whether Government had any right upon the tanks. If so, it was suggested that the2 Admiralty might be asked whether they had any use for them. Mr. Graham Wallis then explained that the business of the Perim Coal Company in Perim would be completed on August 15th and they were anxious to remove their skeleton staff as soon as possible after that date. They had no wish, however, to place Government in an awkward position, and they would therefore be glad to know upon what date it would be convenient for their Manager to leave the Island finally and for him to hand over to Government the water-making plant which is to be taken over temporarily by Government. It was explained to Mr. Graham Wallis that steps were being taken to put into effect the Chief Commissioner^ proposals for the maintenance by Government of minimum Services; but that nothing had been done so far in regard to the installation of the new condenser, and that it was hoped that arrangements could be made for an indefinite loan from the Company of the necessary existing water making plant. Mr. Graham Wallis explained that the Company were not prepared to make an indefinite loan; that the water tug in question had already been earmarked for sale ; that the Company hoped to dispose of various other items of the plant, and that they had not considered a loan ofmore than about three months. This led letter to the Company of 25th February which had apparently been misunderstood by the Company; and this in turn was followed by a general discussion as to the relevant merits of the future arrangement for supplying water at Perim as suggested by Sir Bernard Reilly in in view of the reluctance of H.M.G. to incur any considerable capital expenditure at this juncture, it was suggested that it might be useful for Mr. Graham Wallis to make an offer on behalf of his Company to sell the plant in question to the Government. He mentioned the figure of £2,000 which he promised to confirm in writing. Pending a consideration of this offer and further discussion between the Government Departments concerned, Mr. Graham Wallis agreed that the plant should over temporarily to Governmel Mr. Graham Wallis then raised the matter of communications, and explained that Cable &amp; Wireless and Lloyds were also anxious to evacuate the Island as soon as possible, and that he would be glad to know when Government would be ready to take over these Services. He was informed that an attempt beei? made to find out when Government would be in a to a discussion of paragraphy^of the 16th November. Finally, _position to do so, and that Cable &amp; Wireless might in the meantime be informed that steps were being taken in this direction. Mr. Graham Wallis then left, and the representatives of the Colonial Office and India Office agreed that the instructions which had been drafted to the Government of India should issue with various alterations so as to include the points which had been raised in the course of the meeting; in particular, so as to ascertain the earliest date upon which Government would be in a position to take over the various essential Services from agreed that the question of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's rights should be looked into by the India Office, and that Mr. Graham Wallis's offer to sell the water plant should be considered when it was received. the Perim Coal Company.I r\ BO i r\j 6 July, 1936. My dear Clauson, We have been considering your letter of the 26th June with which you enclosed a draft of a telegram to the Government of India regarding Perim. v We have consulted the Treasury on the matter, and we concur in the terms of the telegram subject to the addition of the following v/ords at the end of paragraph 1 of the draft, i.e. after the v/ords ,f 28th February'''You will no doubt also consider whether any other second hand equipment can be taken over from Company e.g. motor car'. It seems v/orth while including this in case there are certain items of stock which it v/ould be more economical to take over second-hand from the Company, thus avoiding the purchase of new equipment. As regards the incidence of expenditure between Imperial and Indian revenues which is dealt v/ith in the Government of India’s express letter of CLAUSON, ESQ. thethe 13th January, 1936, we regard the proposals of the Government of India as reasonable, and on receipt of your official letter we would propose to invite the Treasury to accept those proposals. I am sending a copy of this letter to Wardley and Seal* Yours sincerely,Minute Paper. Department. Please see the previous submission at P.Z.1020/36 below regarding the future of Perim Island, It was then pointed out that the question fe±l into two parts: (a) the determination of the Perim Coal Company’s lease, (b) the future arrangements for the administration etc. of the Island. No advance has yet been made in regard to (a) and a reply is still awaited from the Company regarding the terms on which their lease may be determined. Meanwhile there has been a good deal of correspondence i *^ W/I and discussion as to the commercial future of the Island. A This, of course, to a large extent determines the future arrangements for the administration etc. of the Island, as it was not possible to take any decision in regard to the latter until it was knovtfiwhether any, and if so which, of the commercial bodies in the Island were going to remain there. It now appears almost certain that no commercial bodies will remain and that the Island will be reduced to its ordinary indigenous population. In these circumstances Sir Bernard Beilly (who is now on leave) has pointed out that it is desirable to give the Acting Chief Commissioner instructions as to what he is to do when the Perim Coal I Company remove from the Island the skeleton staff which they have been maintaining there pending their negotiations with the other commercial bodies. In his letter of the 16th November, at P.Z.8664/35, the Chief Commissioner made certain proposals for the maintenance of the minimum essential services in the Island in the event of the commercial companies leaving. The G. of l. in their letter of the 13th January 1936, at , fii P.Z.705/36, honourpod in the Chief Commissioner's i^commoncra-t arena /.s!*Ja u*JUu/s&gt; F^aej 2 iffi©jftaati©^is and stated that while they were prepared to bear the increased recurrent expenditure at Perim until the transfer to the Colonial Office, they were not prepared to meet any capital expenditure. It is under stood demi officially that the Treasury agree that this is reasonable. The anticipated net recurrent expenditure per annum is estimated at 50,000 rupees as against about 9,000 rupeeb at present. (It will be remembered that at present the Perim Coal Company perform several services which ought properly to be performed by Government.) As transfer to the colonial Office will take effect on the 1st April 1937, India will not be liable for more than 9 months at the outside of increased expenditure, and the total sum involved is therefore not more than 30,000 rupees. The expenditure will be inevitable and has been accepted in principle by the G.of I. Subject, therefore, to the concurrence of the Colonial Office and the Treasury it is proposed to issue a telegram to the G.of I. in the terms of the attached draft. Sanction is accordingly requested for its issue^with any minor amendments which the other Departments may wish to incorporate). At the same time it will be as well to clear up with the Colonial Office and the Treasury the question of incidence of expenditure between H.M.G. and the G#of I. A draft official letter for this purpose is also submitted. llu facuMuJ Jl'P' cUua^Draft Paper. ^•2-. ^l /;/ Department. DRAFT u.s.s., ~n rt r- T* • vT# c-.o i ENCLOSURE in A!R mail letter I NO.

Prom this you will see that in the past Lambert Brothers have run the Shell’s hunkering installation in conjunction with their coal hunkering business and that, following the decision of Lambert Brothers to &lt;jlose down their coal business, the Shell are contemplating the closing down of their oil installation on the ground that it would be uneconomic to run it as a separate concern. They are, however, prepared to consider maintaining the installation if H.M. Government should consider it essential that it should be maintained and are prepared to provide for the maintenance of certain essential services. The installation is noted in the Admiralty volume of bunkering facilities abroad (OU 6159). It is the only one at Perim. Telephone: Victoria 9310. Telegrams: Mintndust, Sowest, London.

With regard to the lighting and buoyin of v the Harbour, I regret that I cannot see what inducement there is to Government to undertake this expenditure which, as far as I can judge, would be entirely for the benefit of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, as the Harbour would not be maintained if no commercial Company were there, unless the Admiralty were to decide to do so, of which at present there is no indication. If it were likely that the presence of the Asiatic Petroleum Company would attract so many ships to Perim that Government could revoer the cost of maintaining the harbohr by charging port dues, or if the Company 1 s business were expected to be on such a scale that Government would be recouped by the recover of income tax from them, there would be seme justification for proposing that the new Aden Administration (that is, primarily the Aden taxpayers) should pay to keep up Perim harbour| but failing some such inducement, there appear to me to be no adequate grounds on which such a proposal, which would be tantamount to a subsidy to the Company, could be recommended or accepted. There is, moreover, not much prospect that the presence of the Asiatic Petroleum Co. would go far towards relieving unemployment among the people of the Island, as they would probably employ very few of them.Tho Harb ur could probably bo oalntalned by tho Asiatic Compnror more aconoaiicaily than by jovsrment, and the Coapany, thiy undertook maintea^nco, would be able to rovoor 3 me jf the cost fr a port duet# 2 &gt;ur other proposal is that lioveroment should stake any annual paynant t- Cables and Wireless instead f eractir.^ a Wirelias Station if their own at Parim.

We have now consulted the various authorities concerned and are sorry to say that there appears to be no hope of Government agreeing to make any contribution towards the maintenance of telegraphic communications. It is estimated that such a subvention could not fail to be very much more costly than the maintenance of the . small wireless set which would, if necessary, be installed. In regard to the lighting and buoyage of the harbour, we fear there is no prospect of Government departing- from the decision, as stated in my letter of 25th February, that whilst in the present state of emergency they do not wish to see the harbour abandoned, they would not feel justified in bearing the cost involved in a permanent upkeep of the harbour. This means that it is not possible to hold out any hopes to Asiatic of the harbour being maintained at Government expense.2. I am sorry this reply is so negative; hut you will no doubt be glad to know precisely where you stand.

GRAHAM '^LLIS R EGARDING PERIM COAL COMPANY'S LEASE Mr. Graham Wallis called on the 20th February. I had informed him confidentially of the general terms of the letter which it is proposed, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State in Council, to send him in regard to the terminal ion of the lease and future arrangements. He said he was very grateful for this advance information and, of course, realised that he could take no action until the letter reached him officially. probably be demanded from the Company in respect of outstanding rent the Government's last word? The Company would, he was afraid, be very disappointed, as they had hoped to be allowed some little advantage, and what this figure appeared to amount to was merely a consolidation of the actual sums that would be payable. I said that this was a matter for the financial authorities concerned, but that the figure had in fact been put up by the Government of India, who were not for a moment prepared to accept the suggestion made by the Local Manager that a sum representing five years' rent might be accepted, and had been agreed to by the financial authorities in this country. I was rather afraid that any come back by the Company might be met with a 'take it or leave it' attitude. I thought that in any case, however, this question was linked up with the other question of the cancelling of the dilapidations against the hire of plant. It might possibly make a o Cj • He was however anxious for information on two points. Was the lump sum which it was understood would good/might/ good impression if the Company were forthcoming on the subject of the plant. He confirmed that there was no difficulty about the plant, and this brought him to his second point, which was whether, if they took over the plant temporarily, the Government would also wish to take over any staff. This was an important point, as the Company were withdrawing their staff and now only had a skeleton staff of six on the Island. I said that we had heard from Sir Bernard Reilly that even if the Government had to run the water supply, etc. any technical staff, other than that locally recruited, would be available from Aden. The Company need not, therefore, worry about the staff question so far as that was concerned. 3. Mr. Wallis went on to say in confidence that there was now quite a firm prospect of the Asiatic staying in the Island. He understood that this was not unconnected with the activities of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, the idea apparently being that the Asiatic would be reluctant to leave a station unoccupied which might be snapped up by the Standard Oil people with a view to gate-crashing into the Aden market. He further hinted that it was just possible that the Perim Coal Company themselves might, after all, reconsider the question of terminating their lease (especially, perhaps, if they got no financial advantage from terminating it). The Asiatic would, of course, need considerably more buildings than they had at present if they stayed on the Island and it was just conceivable that it might be simplest to extend the sub-lease and to go on paying rent under the substantive lease, especially as there was always the hope that times might get better and itmight be possible to reopen a coaling station. This, however, was all very much in the air. 4. Another point that he mentioned was that Lloyds and Cable and Wireless were still very undecided as to whether to stay. It would probably not be a commercial proposition from their point of view, but on the other hand they were reluctant to give up their stations for sentimental reasons. A tentative suggestion he thought might be worth making was that the Government might perhaps consider assisting these two concerns in some way in order to help them to stay. He pointed out that if they went Government would have to provide some sort of communications and he understood from his local people that Government might do this by means of something like a small wireless station. I confirmed that this, in fact, was what Sir Bernard Reilly had in mind, but that all Sir Bernard Reilly's recommendations were based on the assumption that there was going to be a clean sweep and no companies left in the Island. The Government of India had expressly stated in their recommendations that they were made on the assumption that there would be no company left in the Islam who could run essential services. This also, of course, would apply to the water (Mr. Graham Wallis agreed that it was a possible alternative, if Asiatic stayed, that they should continue to run the water service and sell water to the Government, as the Perim Coal Company does at present). I said that I was afraid that our financial authorities might say that Captain Lawson and Lloyds were trying to bounce us into subsidising them to continue a service which, if Asiatic remained in the Island, they might/might in any case continue on their own. This point was left in the air. 5. In regard to future arrangements, Mr. Wallis said that he was in constant touch with the other companies concerned and that there were so many cross currents in the business that he was afraid it might take a little time before we could have a meeting such as was suggested. What he had in mind as a possible arrangement would be that he should get the companies lined up on some concrete basis and that he should then meet the Departments concerned as a representative of all of them. I said that from our point of view I thought that that would be ideal and that we could then have a business like body composed of representatives of the India Office, Treasury, Colonial Office (Admiralty, if they wished) and Mr. Wallis, which would be much better than a gathering of all the companies. The only thing was that I would like about a week’s notice so that we could have an interdepartmental meeting shortly before our meeting with Mr. Wallis. 6. He said that in any case the first thing was to wait for our letter and then he proposed to reply to it in two parts, one in regard to the termination of the lease, dilapidations, etc.,-viz. the questions concerning only the Government and the Perim Coal Company; and (2) the other questions regarding thefhture. I said that that would be quite convenient from our point of view. M.J. CLAUSON. 21st February 1936. INDIA OFFICE.P ■ Z ■ 705/3 6. Minute Paper. CiyZ/zC') Department. ■j - 3939 5000 7/35 The Perim Coal Company ( alias Lambert Bros, of London) have a lease from the (Government of India (or rather the Secretary of State in Council) which expires on 30th April 1943; it gives them certain land and buildings in Perim and permits them to light and buoy the harbour. They have run a coaling station for many years, but have been losing money heavily for some time and hanre abandon the station ^as from 1st January 193^1. They now wish to determine their lease/ This would be quite simple except for the following circumstances. While operating on the island the Coal Company have manufactured water, ice and electricity, have kept a medical staff, and have lit and buoyed the harbour as allowed by the lease. Their manager has also been Administrator of the island, which is attached to the Aden Settlement for administrative purposes. They have therefore, in effect, provided both the administrative and public services for the island. The other inhabitants of the island (which is 5 square miles in area) are the natives in the village, about 1500, the detachment of Armed and Unarmed Police (part of the Aden Police Force), about 50, the lighthouse staff (about 50) employed at the two lighthouses - these are 'route* lights and are essential for the navigation of that part of the ocean - the employes of the Eastern Telegraph Company (Cable &amp; Wireless) which has a small station there and of Lloyd's Signal Station (the two last-named are understood to share employes). The .Bootern -Telegraph -Company and Lloyd's both have direct leases from Government. The Perim Coal Company are agents for Cable &amp; Wireless. Besides the bodies mentioned above, the Asiatic Petroleum/ —LPetroleum Company have a sub-1 ease from the Perim Coal Company, of which we do not know the terms. The Perim Coal Company acts as the agents of the Asiatic Petroleum Company and it is understood that the Asiatic keep no staff of their own at Perim - all their work is done for them by the Coal Company as their agents. It will be seen from the foregoing that the Perim Coal ucmpany for practical purposes is^ Perim. Their decision to leave accordingly produces chaos. The present position is that Asiatic, Cable &amp; Wireless, and Lloyd’s are all undecided whether to stay on the Island. In each case their decision appears to turn largely on how far Government will be prepared to run the services which have hitherto been run by the Coal Company. Asiatic in particular (who are of course the main problem - Cable &lt;&amp; Wireless and Lloyd’s are a small proposition) cannot apparently afford to stay if they have to take over the Coal Company’s duties - they are understood to be losing money themselves and are only anxious to stay in the island for sentimental reasons - viz. they are reluctant to give up a long-standing stat ion. The position frcm the point of view of Government is that whatever the commercial bodies do, there are certain minimum duties which have to be performed in the Island. The lighthouses have to remain, as they light the main shipping route to India, etc. The indigenous inhabitants of the island must be provided for, and there is bound to be a semi-defence police force maintained on the island. Kor these purposes a water supply and medical arrangements are essential (there is no spring water on the island). Ice and electricity are not essential. The harbour, apparently, is not essential (though the Admiralty would not like to see it closed altogether)/Minute Paper. Department. -b'la-^ A. altogether). finally, some kind of administration is required. These are the elements of the problem. It falls into two parts, (a) the de t ermination of the Coa l C ompany’ s 1 ease ( D ) the fu tu re administration et c. of the Islan d. As regards (a) we are largely concerned. As regards ! (b), we are only really in the position of caretakers for the Colonial Office who will be taking over Aden in, probably, about a year’s time. The proposals in regard to (a) are given in paras.4 and 5 of the Government of India’s letter of the 13th January, P.Z.705/36. There seems to be no reason to quarrel with them. As regards (b), it is proposed to leave the matter very largely to the decision of the Colonial Office and Treasury, who have all the papers, and with whom it is proposed to discuss as soon as possible, with a view to a later meeting with the Asiatic Company (and perhaps Lloyd’s and Cable &amp; Wireless) . Suggestions for the line to be taken by Government are made in para.4 of the draft letter to the Company. Detailed proposals for the future are made in Sir B. Reilly’s letter of -November last at P.Z.8664/35. As regards incidence of expenditure and incidence of receipts between H.M.G. and India, it is proposed not to pursue this further than is necessary at the moment. The urgent thing is to get the Perim situation straightened ;out. but the proposals of the Government of India in i p-ras. 6 and 7 of their letter of 13th January reasonable, and one no doubt that tl anuary seem quite that the Treasury 3939 5000 7/35 will/will agree to them. As regards immediate action, please see the d.o. letter of 31st January to the Colonial Office, enclosing a draft of a letter to the Perim Coal Company. This commits us to nothing except the termination of the lease (not much of a commitment as the company are already going !) and the acceptance of a certain lump sum in lieu of 7 annual payments of rent. All the rest will oe subject to negotiation with the numerous parties involved and will have to be submitted comprehensively for sanction in due course. oecretary, financial Department, have you any observations to offer at this stage v Political Secretary , Having looked through these papers, which I now see for the first time, I must admit feeling some doubt whether the saving involved, though it is appreciable, is adequate justification for leaving the Island and harbour almost derelict^ so that the native inhabitants will be still further impoverished and the harbour no longer available as an occasional place of refuge and not immediately available for naval purposes in case of emergency# These, however, are questions which are now A the concern of the Colonial Office^ a«4 Admiralty^ W'W It is possible that the Colonial Office will accept the Government of India's contention that the whole of the initial outlay should be borne by His Majesty's Government. If, however, they demur I doubt whether you can insist to the full extent, since the expenditure will apparently become necessary while the administration ofMinute Paper. Department. 3436b 3000 1/35 of the Island is,still an obligation upon us* 1 am rather puzzled by paragraph 5 of the draft letter, which seems to suggest that, since harbour material is likely to be required only temporarily, the question of securing even its temporary retention can be disregarded* If some such material is likely to be required for the time being and if there is a likelihood of the loan of / A it being lumped in with the other temporary loans under paragraph 4 as part of a general quid pro quo, would it not be better to group it, as regards proposed treatment, with the items under paragraph 4 so as to avoid the possibility that, if the requirement should be subsequently found to exist, a further unnecessary payment may have to be made? 'ikt figure of Rs.96,000 appears to be almost exactly^ correct on the assumption that the payment in respect of capitalised value is made at or about the 1st May 1936. If the time of payment differs substantially from this, the effect of the interest element would, of course, be to vary the amount required as composition. 6th February 1936.

Dear Mr. Graham Wallis, With reference to our correspond ence about the Perim Coal Company's lease, I am now able to inform you of 2. It is agreed that the lease of the Company may be terminated with effect from the 1st January, 1936. The necessary legal steps could of course be taken at leisure. The outstanding rent may be discharged by Rs.96,000 (£7,200). This sum is composed of four months' rent (to 1st May, 1936) and the capitalised value of seven annual payments of cancelled out against the liability of Government in respect of such plant or material as they may wish to hire or take over from the Company. It is impossible to specify GORY S *! i . , . . — iju-jlAt . the attitude of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. a lump sum payment amounting to 3. As regards dilapidations, it is suggested that the Company’s liability under Clause 2(d) of the lease, for the maintenance of buildings should be Rs.14756/14/8 (£1,106.15.5) © per annum. 4.precisely what such plant or material would amount to. But it is likely that Government may require temporarily one of the existing sets of condenser plant, two 45-ton. tanks, one lifting barge, one tug and one water boat, and the use of a slipway, until such time as a new condenser is installed. This is on the assumption that Government will have to provide the essential water-supply for the island. A The only other possible require ment of Government which can be foreseen is harbour material, in the event of maintenance of the harbour being undertaken by Government. But f t. h i ,q / p-a-n t hi pfr her ^ K because although in the present state of emergency in that part of the. world Sis Majesty*s Government would not wish to sec the harbour abandoned. they would not he* justified in bearing the cost involved in its permanent upkeep. re- As regards the buildings in the concession area, it may be helpful to state that Government are not likely themselves to use more than two, viz. Point House and one other house (for use by an engineer). v The above points in regard to the proposed termination of the Company* s /V3 lease appear to be the points which concern only the Company and Government. These being settled, we would suggest meeting the Asiatic petroleum Company (and, if convenient, Cable &amp; Wireless and Lloyds) at- 1 tho Goloiiie^f Off a. co, and discussing future arrangements. In this connection it may be useful to give the general provisional views of the departments concerned, viz. (a) that Government would be glad to see the Asiatic Company remain in the island on general grounds; (b) that, however, Government would not^b-e justified, merely in order to induce the Company to remain, in providing more in the way of essential services (e.g. water and medical staff) than would be provided if only the inhabitants of the island and the lighthouse-keepers had to be considered; (c) that apart from the buildings mentioned above, any buildings, with the necessary land, could be provided for the Asiatic Company on reasonable terms. The date of ourmeeting can be arranged by telephone. Any conclusions subsequently to be put forward to the **&lt;x!Ukj k\U ) reached of course, have ■authorities concerned for final approval. This letter has received the concurrence of the colonial Office tlo-CjdUy who, of course, are princh-pally concerned in the future of the island, since the control of Aden will shorty be passing to thenu (eU-yji s/(a^ H- Yours sincerely, gd.)

'10 February, 1936. M/ V/e have been considering the correspondence enclosed with your letter P.Z.705/36 of the 31st January regarding the termination of the lease held by the.perim Coal Company. Subject to what follows, we see no objection to the draft letter v/hich you propose to send to the Company, and subject to the concurrence of the Treasury, we are quite content for it to be issued immediately. The further questions which arise will, as you suggest, need discussion at a meeting of the interested Departments. I presume that the Departments concerned are the Treasury, Admiralty, India Office and ourselves and that representatives from those four Departments would attend the meeting. . * We do, however, feel that both with regard to the •j r inter-departmental meeting and the subsequent meeting with the Asiatic Petroleum Company etc., it would be better that these M.J. CLAUSON, ESQ.,these meetings should take place at the India Office, The Colonial Office is, of course, as you say, now very much concerned in the matter, but the transfer of the Settlement etc. will not take place for some fifteen months yet, and as long as the settlement remains part of India, the India Office must remain the executive department for dealing with the Companies concerned and for carrying out the administrative action required. We could not agree to be responsible for the executive conduct of the matter, for which, pending the transfer of the administration, we have no machinery. I suggest, therefore, that you should take out the words 'at the Colonial Office' from paragraph 7 of the draft letter and reword paragraph 10 of the draft as follows 'This letter has received the concurrence of the Colonial Office, v/ho, of course, are closely concerned in the future of the island, since the control of Aden will be passing to them before very long.' Apart from the draft letter to Graham Y/allis, we have been looking into the other points which arise out of the Government of India 1 s proposals in their express letter - '-1/ - —letter of the 13th January, and there is one point which I had better mention at once. The various matters involved will no doubt be discussed at the proposed inter-departmental meeting, but I ought to point out that if approval is given to the Government of India*s proposal that the capital expenditure required for the introduction of the new regime at Perim should be borne by His Majesty’s Government, the question immediately arises as to making the necessary provision for the requisite amount in the Aden Sub-Head of the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote for 1936-37. If any sum is to be included for this purpose it would have to be settled in the next few days. I suggest, however, that the most satisfactory way of dealing with this point would be for the Government of India to meet the expenditure in the first instance and to recover later from His Majesty’s Government such sum as is decided upon. The necessary provision could then be made in the 1937-38 Estimates, probably as part of the general settlement with the Government of India which will have to be made at that timet* GcnxrrT of Fcroign and Political Department. -7 ^ No J.26S-li/35* Dated New Delhi, theJanuary 1936.

Te accent generally Qiief Ccmissioner's appreciation of services required and ci estimated cost thereof. Tv'o statements summarising the app i o^. in ate initial and recurring expenditure involved in the Chief Commissioner's srneme for the administration of Per in: are attached to this letter. It is assumed that the.third method of water supply recommended by the Chief Commissioner as most economical will be adopted and that the contribute n of His Majesty's Government towards the cost cf the Perim .armed police which is included in their limp sum contribution of £8,OCO for Aden, Perim and Kamo ran will remain unaffected by the change.

DEPT. 2 9 JAN 1936 INDIA OFFICE- 2 - estimates proceed on assur.pticn that no subsidi ry company remains in Perim in a position to maintain services at present provided by the Perim Goal Company. The estimates also omit mention of postal revenue and expenditure, the figures of which up to the year ending 193':)-34 have been shewn in the statement 17 attached to this letter, the estimates moreover do not include any sum for establishment and maintenance of ' ireless communication (para. 9 cf Chief Commissioner’s letter). 3. The maintenance cf the route lights at perim will remain of equal importance in future and provides an important reason for the maintenance of an effective administration on the island. Since arrangements will presumably remain as at present, the estimates have not been ccmplicarted by inclusion cf this item, but question may have important bearing on decision whether or not harbour should be maintained. Decision on this point we must leave to His Hajesty’s Government. 4. .e agree with your conclusion that since Perim Coal Company are under no obligation under their lease to continue public services, there is no object in holding them to their lease, amid that the Company ’s ofier to terminate it by a lump sum payment with effect from the 1st January 1936 may be accepted. As regards the amount of lump-sum payment, ve al -e unable to see on what basis 5 years' rent is be be accepted. The amount which should be paid in one lump to discharge the liability will be Rs. 96,p00 roundly being 4 months rent plus capitalised value oi 7 annual puytionbs oi As. 14756-14-8 D 3t % per annum. This is ohe sum which the company should be required oo pay. 5. ith reference to paras. 18 to 20 ci Chief Commissioner’s letter we consider thau Compcuij^ o liabiliLy for maintenance cf buildings should, it possible, be set Qxf against hire of plant and purchase oi h-.ib^ur naoeiials (if it is decided to undertake nr irtonance ci harbom ;. If Company is not prepared to accept this, adjustment could be'made after assessment as proposed by Chief Commissioner by officer in charge Civil -erks, Aden, unu Id nager-3- 1,'anager of Company. 6. It will be seen from appended statements that an initial outlay of Rs. 1,C4,C00 (in round figures) will be required if harbour is net maintained, and oi Rs. 1,38,000 if harbour is maintained- and as against the present net recurring expenditure of Rs. 9,100. Rs. 5C,C0C will be the net expenditure if harbour is not maintained, and this figure will rise to Rs. 64,800 after payment of rent by the Goal Company ceases. If the harbour is maintained, the net expenditure is estimated at Rs. 64,6C0 risinr os Rs. 79,400 after cessation of rent paid by the Coal Company. Primary questions for consideration by Government ar-c; allocation between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India of (a) lump sum payment made by Company, (b) recurring expenditure, and (c) initial expenditure. as regards (a) we are prepared to accept principles proposed in your Express Letter Ho .P. Z. 5876/35, dnuea 26oh ^ugust 1935, th t the division should be made in proportion to tne period of tenure of each party, that is to say, the Government of India should receive 7173 of the lump sum payment, X being the period during which the government of Indi : will be responsible for the administration in Perim counting from 1st January 1936. The Government ox India v 'ould, in any case, have been entitled to the rent iron: the Coal Company until the date of tr nsfer of administr.tion of .xden and Perim, had the Coal Company continued as lessee. 7. On the same principle we are prepared to accept liability for recurring expenditure under scheme up to the date of transfer on understanding th-.t His Lnjebty o Government’s contribution for police expenditure ill continue unaffected. e think however that this liability should be limited to tho amount necessary if the harbour is not m intained, the maintenance ci the harbour, if decided on for reasons of larger policy, being a picpei cha rge ■ 0charge cn L::t er i; 1 revenues. zis regards (c) we ccnsider, in view ox the impending transfer of Aden, that ve should net he called upon tc pay any part of initial outlay especially us the assets Till also become the property cf His L'ujosty’s Government on the transfer cf the island. The entire liability should, therefore, be borne by His Majesty’s Government. Q. On assumption that no subsidiary company ^ill remain on island and therefore that administration a ill be in the hands of civil official, we agree to Chief Commissioner’s proposal in paragraph 1C of his letter, and as special case would be prepared to agree t j conferment of judicial powers up to the rank of Magistrate II Class, on Police Officer visiting Aden.

Is there no possibility that the Asiatic Petroleum Company might be induced to maintain the harbour permanently on the reduced scale I have indicated above ?

He said that there were three points on which he would be very grateful for any information which we could give him, in view of the fact that the Perim Coal Company’s staff would be withdrawn from the Island and the Asiatic Petroleum Company were exceedingly anxious for further information in order that they might come to a decision regarding the future of their own station at perim. one particular reason for urgency from their point oi viev/ is that the Uilk of their contracts expire at the end of the year and they are in some difficulty about renewals. The points were - (a) The maintenance 01 the harbour . I told Mr. ’Wallis that it was impossible to say anything definite about this but that it looked very much as if neither His Majesty* s Government nor the Government of India would be prepared-,to take any responsibility in regard to the maintenance of the harbour, and that if the Asiatic Company stayed on in the Island they would have to make the necessary arrangements in regard to maintenance themselves. Mr. Wallis was very grateful for this indication, which I explained to him, and he Quite realised, was unoiiicial. He said that his own personal opinion was that if the Asiatic Company had to bear the cost of the2. maintenance oi th.e harbour they would probably decide to abandon their Station. (b). ,7ater . I told Mr. ViTallis what Sir Bernard Reilly^ suggestions were in this regard and said that it seemed clear that Government would have to provide some sort of water supply for the Island, ani that any outside concern such as the Asiatic would probably be able to buy water on much the same basis as at present. ( c )« Medical arrangements . I told Mr. Wallis roughly what Sir Bernard Reilly*s suggestions were, and he seemed to think they would be quite satisfactory from the point of view of any concern such as the Asiatic remaining on the island. I made it clear to Mr. Graham Y/allis that we had not yet got either the views of the Government of India or oi the interested Departments of His Majesty 1 sSpovernment, and that in view of the coming transfer to Aden the India Oifice were, in any case, not in a position to give him any dexinite decisions. I told him that our idea was to have a meeting with him and the Asiatic Company at which the Colonial Oiiice would, no doubt, be represented as soon as we were in a position to ck&gt; so. He thought that would be by far the best plan, and he hoped that it would be possible to have the meeting before long. He raised one point in regard to water supply, viz: what the Government of India propose to do about staff for the water supply. At present the supply is, of course, run by the Perim Coal Company* s staff which they are anxious to withdraw. This point will be taken up with India and Aden.All quotations sub-feet to our confirmation on acceptance, unless otherwise stated, and to our usual Act of God, War, Stride, etc., clauses.

I am not in a position to offer any detailed comments on the proposals put forward by the Onager, Perim Coal Company, until such time as j know what the Covernment of in die» s decision will be with regard to the future status of pe rim. 3* With reference to paragraph 5 of the Onager, Perim Coal Company* s letter, I wi sh to state that we have no copy of the Perim Coal company’s sublease to the Asiatic Petroleum ^ompany. ‘Je have never received any comnuni ca ti on from the Perim C 0 al ^mpany regarding the sub-let ting to the Asiatic Petroleum Company which in the circumstances is a breach on the part of the Company of clause 2(g) of the present lease. / I ha v e et c., Sd.

Sir, With reference to my call today, i have the honour to confirm the various points discussed in regard to the above subject. 1. As I informed you it is the desire, due to bad trading conditions over a number of years, of the Perim Coal Company to evacuate perim at the earliest possible date, not later tnan the end of the present year. It is understood that ^our Lease with the Government of India expires on the 30th April 1943 which 4 from the end of 1935, gives term of 7-^ years to run. I am to request that in the event of the Govern ment agreeing to a surrender of the Lease, they will meet the Company in the matter of compounding outstanding rent liability as at the end of the present year. I would suggest a period of five years- 19 36/494 0 inclusive. 2. Buildings ^ Erections. A reference to the Lease Clause 2( l etc.) will show that trie Company has certain liabilities with regard to buildings and erections on the Concession. The Company is liable for such deterioration a s is not attributable to fair wear and tear.The Le a se provides for the G-ovemmer,t the right on three months notice to take over at the termination of same any buildings etc at a price to be arranged* Assuming the Government does not exercise this right the Company must remove all buildings etc. or forfeit them to the Government. If therefore the Government agrees to a surrender of the Lease it is requested that v/ithin the next two or three months a representative is sent to Perim to accept the buildings as at that date. After evacuation by the Company buildings etc. would rapidly fall into disrepair and we do not wish to be called upon at the due expiry of the Lease In i£4 3 to make good such dilapidation. 3. PJgHIlI HARBOUR, LIGHTING etc . The Lease confers on the Company the right to light Perim Ra rbour for a period of ten years commencing the 1st iray 1927 (see Clause 6 et seq) expiring on the 1st M&amp;y 19 37 leaving a 5 period to run of 1 '12“ years from the end of 19 35. The obligation ■which the Lease imposes upon the Company is that of removing moorings etc. etc. within three months after the Company* s right to light the Harbour comes to an end unless the Government elects to take them over at a valuation. */ith the evacuation of perim by the Company by the end of the present year the Company requests the assent of the Government to apply the terms of the Lease as if evacuation was taking place at the due expiry of the Lease. That is to say the Government taking over all moorings etc. etc. at a valuation or permit the Company to remove same4* MA. CH 11,' 3 HY &amp; H. AITT , I think I am correct in assuming that all machinery and plant ashore and afloat remains the property of the company and that we can therefore dispose of it as and how we wish. It is possible that the Government may desire to take over certain of the plant and .aachinery upon evacua tion by the Company; for example water ^king ice and electric lighting plants. Gove^mmeict may consider O' treating with the Company for the above or part thereof. 5. ASIATIC PETRCL3U1-: CCl/PAETY. The pe rim Coal Company are Agents for this Company and granted them a Sub-Lease dated 18th June 1921. This Sub-Lease continues until the Head Lease (which the Perim Coal company holds from the Government of India) is determined. The Agency agreement may be determined by either party on three months notice but it is specially provided that if the perim Coal company determines the Agreement the Lease to the Asiatic petroleum is to continue and the perim Coal Company is under an obi iga tion * to make every endeavour to arrange with the Government of India to renew the Asiatic petroleum company’s Lease upon existing terms. Wy I therefore please be advised if the Government of India will be willing, if the Asiatic Petroleum Company desire to remain, to grant that Company a fresh Lease upon the terms now existing. It is at present uncertain what attitude the Asiatic petroleum Company will adopt but the latest telegraphic advices from London show the xietter is receiv ing their close consideration and it is possible they may remain. 6. LLOYDS* As is well known Lloyds have a signalling station at perim afcd it is uncertain at the moment what their instructions are in regard to continuing after thewithdrawal of the Perim Coal Company. The latest telegraphic advices from London state tne position depends largely on the Government Indian decision in connection with water supplies» lighting and the provision of a medical officer. ’.ray I please be advised in regard to these matters and algo in the event of Lloyds wishing to withdraw at the end of 1935 whether Government will argee to a cancellation of the Lease (I regret I have no copy of this document) and compounding of the outstanding rent lia bility. TULdlG RA PH CC;*dPAhY. This Company* s station “t perim is controlled by the Perim coal Company and worked by Lloyds Signalmen. Telegraphic advices received from London show that the Telegraph Company are unable to come to any decision although earlier advices stated they would probably close upon withdrawal of the Company. A separate and direct Lease exists between the Government of India and the Telegraph Company, the terms of which I am unaware. F®y i however please be advised whether in the event of the Telegraph Company closing down, the Government of India will agree to a cancellation of the Lease and compounding of the outstanding rent liability. In conclusion I would state that the whole of the above subject has been fully discussed by my London Principals with sir Bernard Reilly on the 18th instant and it is with his concurrence that I approach you upon these various matters. I have etc., Sd./ C.C.Davey, Manager, perim coal Company, Ltd.INDIA OFFICE, WITKIIALL, SiW.X. 30th August* 1935* Dear Sir Bernard * I enclose for your information a copy of a letter to Caroe* enclosing a copy of the Per in Coal Goiiipany f 8 memorandun about the cost of the Central Cervices* T se are also sending a copy to Aden and the Colonial cjffice.

The revenue from sales to steamers and local sales, which has kept this a profit account, will largely not he avail able in future, therefore in making estimates no credit will re take* for any income* Ho douht a number of traders will remain on the Island and require water on payment. With an outturn for the six months January/June 1935 of 3874 tons, the cost was Rs. 2 # 10 annas - a fair average cost. Of this tonnage the sales to Government were 726 tons, which oompm s with 807 , 814, and 773 tons in the three half yearly periods immediately preceding 1935 . The boilers of the Yaryan plant are at present coal fired. The following estimate of the cost of this Water Department represents a saving to Government on their present contract; hut it should he noted that no charge has been inserted in these estimates for depreciation nor for interest on capital outlay in acquiring plant.

(Harbour and beacon lights are not electric.) The supply of electricity has not been an extravagant luxury, and it is difficult to estimate more than a small reduction in the above costs through the generation of fewer units.

To superintend the water and ice plants and the Power House; to control the stores; to be in charge of the Asiatic Petroleum 00 * 8 ., plant for receiving and supplying oil, an engineer and assistant would be needed.

CLAUSON/: p PERIM GOAL COMPALT Sir Bernard Reilly called at the Office on August 20th to discuss this question^ Mr. Cowell of the Colonial lA/Tw Office —Clausen-wepe present. Sir Bernard began by saying that the Perim Coal Company were not obliged by their lease to continue public services which at the moment they perform, e.g. lighting and buoying, supplying of Government Agents and providing water. The question of continuing these services, therefore, had to be faced whatever view might be taken of the Company’s proposals for terminating their lease. He therefore proposed that the Company should be allowed to terminate their lease on conditions convenient to Government but which at the same time might be in the nature of a concession to the Company. They might therefore be inclined to hand over to the Government such buildings and plant as might be required. In the second place Sir Bernard Reilly proposed that the Government should maintain the essential services on the island, i.e. administrative and magisterial, sanitation and medical, police, lighting and buoying of harbour and supply of water, ice and electricity. The scale of maintenance will inevitably depend upon whether the Asiatic Petroleum Company decide to stay or not. The feasibility of the proposal was also dependent upon the question of cost. Sir Bernard Reilly was not in a position to give any figures but he suggested that the Chief Commissioner at Aden should be asked to furnish some estimate. Sir Bernard then proceeded to explain the details of his scheme. (1) Administrative and Magisterial . Three alternative suggestions were put forward (a) that perim Island should continue as at present to be controlled directly by the Chief Commissioner at/(b) (c) at Aden through an administrator and that the duties should be performed by one of the present Aden officials, e.g. the Commandant of Police or the Assistant Commandant of Police. If this scheme was adopted the further questions arose of what remuneration should be paid to the Aden official who performs the extra duties and how often.the official should visit Aden. Sir Bernard thought that an allowance should be paid to the official of a smaller nature than that paid at present to the Government Representative. As regards the frequency of visits, Sir Bernard thought once a month would be sufficient and additional visits in exceptional circumstances. The question of transport was clearly important. Sir Bernard mentioned that the R.A.F. at Aden made fortnightly flights to Perim and Kamaran. and had in the past always been willing to take the Commissioner of Police to Perim on his three- monthly tours of inspection. He therefore suggested that the Air Ministry should be asked if it would be possible to fly an Aden official to Perim every month and suggested that if an additional plane was necessitated by these more frequent visits, some payment should be offered to the Air Ministry. that these services should be performed by the Aden Settlement Authorities as Perim nominally forms part of the Aden Settlement, that the Asiatic Petroleum Company in the event of their deciding to stay at Perim should be approached to supply Government Agents. This scheme /scheme suffers from the drawback that there is no means of knowing whether the Asiatic Petroleum Company official will be suitable. Sir Bernard Reilly was in favour of alternative (a) but he suggested that the Chief Commissioner at Aden should be consulted as to the relative merits of the three schemes. (2) Sanitation and Medical . Sir Bernard repeated what he had said in paragraph 5 of his note (P.Z. 4284) and suggested that the Chief Commissioner at Aden should be consulted as to the cost. (3) Police . Sir Bernard said this question presented no immediate difficulty. There could be no question of reducing the strength of the Aden Police and if a contingent were withdrawn from the Island it could be usefully employed at Aden itself. (4) Lighting and Buoying of Harbour . Sir Bernard said that if Government took over these services, ships using the harbour should pay dues sufficient to recoup Government for the expenditure involved. He said, however, that if the Asiatic Petroleum Company preferred to pay a fixed sum in return for the upkeep of the harbour by Government there would be no objection. (5) Supply of Y/ater. Ice and Electricity . If Government took over these services Sir Bernard thought that they could be made self-supporting and he suggested that an expert should be sent from Aden to examine the plant of the Perim Coal Company and discover whether they could be worked economically by Government in which case he advocated that the existing plant should be taken over. Various additional points were raised in the course of discussion. (A) If Government were to take over lighting and buoying and supply of water, etc., some permanent head clerk would be/be necessary to collect the dues and arrange the sale of water, etc. (B) Question of taking over plant and buildings, e.g. Agents' house, from the Perim Coal Company. Sir Bernard suggested that the Chief Commissioner at Aden should be consulted on this point and that anything required by Government should be handed over without cash payments as part of the settlement with the Company. (C) Division of the payment made by the Company to the Government of India and the Colonial Office. sir Bernard suggested that the sum should be divided in proportion to the relative tenure of the two parties. Mr. Cowell was doubtful about this point, but suggested that it should be left for future discussion. rJAr.

DRAFT LETTaR. x»t. ^ .Sir Bernard Reilly, KCMG. , CIE.,OBE. Warley, Weeke, Winchester. 3 4 AUG1935 Dear Sir Bernard, Mr.Graham Wallis came round last week and we had what I fear was a rather inconclusive conversation about the termination of the Perim Coal Company’s lease. I gathered, however, from him that the Asiatic Petroleum Company are very keen to stay and I got the impression that if some arrangement can be arrived at in regard to water, ice, medical arrangements etc., they will probably do so. I rather gather from Graham Wallis that you had been going into the question of the expenditure that would-be ^ t*A necessary on these various items, and I told him that I would see whether I could not arrange a meeting with you with a view to our working out seme sort of practical scheme which we could put from here to the Government of India. We could also bring in the Colonial Office at this stage, which would save time. I believe you are coming to town next Monday and if you think it would be worth while, perhaps you could spare time to come round here in the afternoon? 1 might also try to get Blaxter to come over from the Colonial Office. Sraham Wallis said that Davey has now arrived in England and would be ' - available// %available for consultation if we wanted him. txraham Wallis is of course very anxious to get his part of the business settled but I do not see how we can come to a final agreement with the Perim Coal Company until we know what we are going to do in the way of future arrangements. If the Asiatic stay might not one of their people be able to take Davey*s place as Administrator ? Perhaps you will be kind enough to let me have an answer as soon as possible about Monday. Yours •inoerely. (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSON/ PEHIM COAL COMPAM^S LEASE Mr. Graham Wallis, Director of Lambert Brothers, called at the Office on August 9th to discuss this question. He stated in the first place that there was no question of the Company staying at perim. perim Coal was no longer a commercial proposition. There seemed no prospect of trade reviving, and the Company intended to close down business and vacate the island before the end of the year. He said, however, that the Company had no wish to escape from its liabilities. The Company were prepared to pay their annual lease which operates until 1943 should the Government of India desire it. but the Company would prefer to make a final payment of a lump sum now. The question of dilapidation was, however, worrying the Company. At the present moment the charge for dilapidations would be negligible, but if the island was deserted the dilapidations by 1943 would be considerable, and the'therefore wished to make some payment now in settlement of all their obligations under this heading. As regards the subsidiary Companies at present working in Perim, Mr. Graham Wallis said that Lloyds Signals would also almost certainly wish to close down. The Cable and Wireless Company at present had no staff in the island, and it therefore seems likely that they will also wish to close down, though there is just a possibility of their remaining as there is a scheme for joining the station at Perim on to Southern Arabia. As regards the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Mr. Graham Wallis seemed to think there was a strong chance of their remaining, provided there were reasonable facilities on the island for obtaining water etc. Their business had not suffered a similar decline /TELEPHONES- -f brother ^ t-'A, Coaling Stations at: \ \ GIBRALTAR CEUTA ORAN ALGIERS MALTA ISTANBUL ZONGOULDAK FATAL (AZORES) L.&lt;*m&gt;^LMAS PORT SAID SUEZ PERIM BOMBAY COLOMBO SINGAPORE BATAVIA BERMUDA ST LUCIA ST CENT C.V.

I am glad my note was useful: I ought to have mentioned in it that under the '♦Aden settlement Regulation' of 1900 Perim is included in the Aden settlement - that is to say, it is in theory administered by the Chief Commissioner through the Chairman and Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement. This has, however, never been the case in practice, ana the islanu used to be run by an Assistant Resident, Perim (a Military officer commanding the detachment there), and since the removal of the military detachment it has been under the Government Agent (who is the Manager of the Perim Coal Company) working directly under the Chief Commissioner. For various reasons, including distance ana difficul ty of communication and transport, it is not convenient for the settlement Committee to run it, and the Committee derive no revenue from the island. I have therefore not hitherto been in favour of putting theory into practice, ana I still think that it will probably be better to keep tne island separate from the settlement Thank you for your letter and for arranging an This/- 2 - This is a point that can he dealt with later, hut I mention it in case you think it worth passing on to Clauson. —I5DIA OfF’IC i-§ WKLfmkU ., 3.W.1 v Z.5094/35 ?nd August 1935, Dear Colonel Reilly I lv v« written » line to Sr*ham Wellis, of ^ioh I enclose a copy, about the Pmrim Coal Company , s proposals. 1 t tought I had better not be too encouraging because, as you will see from the enclosed copy oi a telegram from the Government of Indie, we are still rather in the sir ov :r this matter* 1 presume from the Government of India 1 s telegram that the acting Chief Co missioner will now put in more concrete proposals.

NOTE BY SIR BERNARD REILLY . The perlm Coal Company’s lease is hue to expire in 1943, hut the Director of Lambert Bros., Ltd., Mr. Graham Wallis, has informed me that during the last two or three years they have been working at Perim at an annual loss of about £14,000 to £16,000 and that his Board have now definitely come to the conclusion that they have no alternative to closing their business there altogether. They desire to come to a settlement with the Government of India covering all their outstanding obligations and they wish if possible to arrange for the payment of a lump sum on closing down, instead of continuing the annual rental due on their lease. The Asiatic petroleum Company have a sub-lease from the Perim Coal Company, who act as their agents for the sale of oil at Perim. It is possible that the Asiatic Petroleum Company may wish to continue their business at perim and if so they will probably wish to enter into a direct agreement with the Government of India. The points arising for the decision of Government are:- (1) the question of agreeing to the Perim Coal Company l s request, (2) The future control of the island, administrative and magisterial. At present the l&amp;nager of the Perim Coal Company is Government agent in the Island and has magisterial powers and Receives a remuneration from Government for his services. He will no longer be available, but it will be necessary to retain some control/0 - 2 - control in the Island, even though the number oi people living in it will be considerably reduced by the closing of the Perim Coal Company. There is a detachment of 50 armed policemen on the Island, which is periodically visited by the Commandant of Police or the assistant Commandant of Police from Aden, and it occurs to me that a solution might be found by giving the Commandant of Police and the Assistant Commandant of Police certain powers in perim, such as those of a Magistrate and for any administrative purposes, that may be necessary and arranging that one of them should visit the Island periodically, perhaps rather more frequently than at present. If this is agreed it may be necessary to arrange for conveyance of these officers to and from Perim, At present they and Political Officers also are conveyed by the .Royal Air Force without charge and if this could be continued it would be the best plan, but it is possible that the Air Ministry may raise objections if the periodic visits must occur at frequent intervals. (3) The police garrison of 30 men would presumably remain on the Island, or it might be possible to reduce it in numbers. But in my opinion some small police force must in any case be maintained. (4) At present the Perim Coal Company do the work of lighting and buoying the harbour. As far as I recollect it is not obligatory for them to do so under the terms of the lease, but is permissive - that is to say, the lease states that they may light and buoy the harbour for the period of their lease. If so, they cannot be compelled to do so when it is no longer in their interest,after closing down, and it will be necessary to decide whether the lighting and buoying of the harbour must be continued. If the coal and oil bunkering/( 7 )/ bunkering business there is completely ended no commercial ships are likely to call at the Island unless they go there lor refuge in bad weather or possibly for water. But naval ships may possibly wish to call and the question of the maintenance of the harbour therefore appears to me to be one on which the Admiralty ought to be consulted. (5) Medica l. At present the perim Goal company doctor performs medical services on the Island, under an arrangement with Government not included in the obligations of their lease. This arrangement would cease when the Company closed down, but some medical provision will have to be made for the police, the lighthouse staff, and the local inhabitants. A resident Sub-Assistant surgeon would probably suffice, but some provision should be made to enable a more senior doctor to be sent to the Island if necessary, or for the transport of sick persons from perim to Aden in an emergency requiring immediate hospital treatment. Here again it would be desirable to come to an understanding with the Air Ministry that they would assist in time of emergency, (6) The Asiatic Petroleum Company, Lloyds Signal Station and the Eastern Telegraph Company also have establishments at perim and it is a question whether they also will wish to close down if the perim Coal Company does so. This point will have to be ascertained and given further consideration if necessary, some method of conmunication with the Island must obviously be maintained and if the Eastern Telegraph Company and Lloyds Signal Station wish to close down a small Government wireless installation would probably have to be maintained.4 (7) The Perim Goal company would be glad to dispose of their buildings, but I aoubt whether they would be of much or any use to Government. There has long been a scheme for providing better accommodation for the police and it is possible that some of the Company's buildings might be suitable, but I rather doubt whether this is so. Government might also find it convenient to take over and retain the Manager of the Perim Coal Company's house for tne use of Government officials when visiting and inspecting the Island. The house is aamall and good one and I suggest this for consideration. (8) The perim Coal Company at present arrange for the water supply on the Island by means of condensers. There are no natural wells and as far as I am aware no probability of finding natural water in the Island. It will therefore be essential to maintain a water supply and I suggest that the Perim Coal Company's condensers ought to be taken over by Government and put in charge of the Civil Works Department in Aden. Here again, the question of transport of staff in charge of the condensers must be considered. INDIA OFFICE. 21st June 1935.p.Z.4284/3a- /' &gt; w 4 B.

My dear Davey, I confirm the two or three telegrams exchanged further with regard to the liquidation arrangements, and as you said you were going to he in Aden on the 19th instant Ivas very anxious to try and get in touch with Colonel Reilly: I eventually had a note from him asking me to meet him at his Cluh on the 18th instant, so I went along ana had about If hours with him. He was very helpful in every way hut was definitely sorry now that he knows the final decision has been made. I had sent you a telegram on the 14th instant outlining what I thought should he the basis of your discussion with Colonel Lake and I shewed it to him and in the main he was quite in accord, and he certainly was a little curious to know exactly what we meant by •compounded* and I explained that really in that word there were two headings to be covered, namely, tnat there was an Annual Rental accruing until the end of the normal period of the Lease and whilst we were not seeking to get out of any obligations under this heading still if the Government could meet us we would much appreciate it if only represented by some ueduction for Interest against a lump sum payment now of an inaebtedness due over certain years; that in fact is a normal commercial transaction, which he agreed ana thought would be given sympathetic consideration. C.c. Davey, Esq., PHRIM.2 % The other point under this same heading, which I pointed out to him was more important in our minds, namely, that the Government of India snould he prepared to agree as at the date of our evacuation a sum to cover the uilapidations under the Lease, which, as I pointed out to him end with which he agreed, amount to next door to nothing while we are in occupation hut which if we went out say at the end of 1935 and then all turned up in 1943 to see what were the dilapidations would he a ridiculous position. This he quite clearly understood and said was quite a reasonable demand. I raised the question as to whether there was any possibility of the Government of India requiring any of our Buildings,, but he could give me no idea beyond referring to the tentative proposal, which you know all about and which you mentioned to me, namely, of building some Police Barracks on the Concession site of the Island - tt for the greater protection of the P.C.C.'. we then touched on the question of the Clause dealing with the right to light the Harbour for 10 years, and he again agreed with me that even if the interpretation was that we must light it for 10 years, namely, until 1st May 1957, that also was an item which could be brought into the Compounded figure. Of course this Lighting item is one which would have to be brought into consideration again in the event of any other Tenants remaining, such as Asiatic, which I shall touch on later. We next discussed the general question of our Buildings etna here a&amp;Ln he could say nothing, and I told him that ±rom our point of view if they did not exercise any rights 0 -l purchase we unuouatedly would have no further use for not be prepared to go to any expense of aismanclins ana we should merely abandon them.- l | ^ TtiQ next point vve touched upon i&amp;'as the contents of certain of the huilaings, more particularly the Water laicing Plant, the Lighting ana Power Station and the Ice Ivachine and Refrigeration. As he tola me that it ’was quite definite that Perim would remain a British Islana under the simplest and cheapest form of administration iu is quite evident that some form of Watertight and Ice must he needed. Next we touched on the question of other Tenants, to wit Asiatic, Eastern Telegraph and Lloyas. I tola him that my definite impression was that the Lloyd’s Signal Station would shut, although actually up to the moment I have not mentioned it to Burges, ana also that the E.T.C. would prohahly close down unless there is some point which will arise other than a Commercial one, that is to say whether the Government might request them to keep some sort of an Installation there, hut as Lawson told me, he can say nothing nor has he anything to base his remarks on. All he coulu say was that from a revenue point of view they could cut it out tomorrow and he better off. Now we come to Asiatic, and Colonel Reilly was very anxious that I should do all I could to inuuce them to stay as naturally he would like to see some Tenants on the Islana. After several minor conversations we had an interview the other afternoon and at the moment it entirely rests with the Fuel Oil Selling Department to put up some scheme to justify the retention of the Depot, and Flanagan cam idly admitted to me that as things are to-day they can quite comfortably cope with all their traffic at other ports, but they, like us, do not like to/to see the closing down of anywhere where they have once started, hut it is quite evident from the result of our interview, end this rather surprised me, that there is no working arrangement whatever between A.P.G*Ch and Asiatic as between Aden and perim, ana they have definitely had to admit that they are very badly placed at Perim to compete with Persian at Aaen. We have discussed with them every possible aspect, such as Personnel, Plant, Accommodation, Repairs, Pood, Water, Light, etc., and at the end of the interview it was decided that they would try and draw up some sort of a skeleton scheme regarding the possible cost of their running a Depot, and they asked me if we would give them the benefit of our advice and experience, which I certainly said we would, and they are going to bring their whole scheme round here in a day or two to see if we can vet it and then it will be laid oefore their Board for decision. There is one other point I touched on with Colonel Reilly, and that was the Medical Officer, and I am quite sure that Asiatic will not go to the expense of keeping a Doctor there, therefore it would be rather interesting to hear what the Government propose from the hadical point of view in respect of the people they will have to keup, such as Lighthouse Keepers and/or what obligation they feel they have in this respect to any Natives who may remain on the Island. I got the impression that Asiatic felt that the Government ought to run the Harbour Lights etc., the Medical and perhaps also the Water and Light, but of course I had to point out that oefore we went there there were many people who nad lived there for a considerable5 time w with nothing ’out a Paraffin Lamp and the Government , think now that they could do the same rather tnan for just two or three. I telegraphed you ugain on the 18th instant a iter I had seen Colonel Reilly, und this letter perhaps contains a repetition oi one or two matters vwiicn have been uealt with before, hut I have asked you to report fully from Aden after you have had your chat with Colonel Lc^ke, uno. as Colonel Reilly has asked to he kept informed I have suggested you had better wait in Aden a day or two as Colonel Reilly might have one or two suggestions to make after I have shewn him the next phase. However you shape the first move up with Colonel Lake it will have to go to the Government of India, which will mean a certain amount of delay, so I think you can fit in your provisional hooking by the ,, KC 1 IHNDINE‘ I ror the 14th July, and you will I understand come Overland from Marseilles, and it may he that perhaps for a short while you may he more useful here, hut I think I must warn you now that based upon what happens you may have to get hack fairly quickly.
