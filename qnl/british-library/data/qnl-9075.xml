Oloth., gilt top, 317 pp. 6s. 6d. * These brief essays, chiefly upon religious thought and practical ethics, first appeared as editorials in The Open Court, a remarkably strong and original Chicago publication devoted to advanced thought. While these essays are opposed to some of the teachings of dogmatic Christianity, they are full of the spirit of the highest Christian morality, and are not in any true sense antagonistic to religious faith. They are constructive rather than destructive.' Ebvibw of Reviews , American Edition. 6 While professing devotion to all the essence of religion, and urging the practice of all Christian virtues, the author attacks dogma with the pitiless persistency of the positivist, and leaves little behind him but fragments. Yet many of his articles might appear without criticism in the most orthodox Church weeklies and magazines.'— New York Herald.

[HOME MISSIONS of the CHURCH of ENGLAND.] Gfficc—ARUHDEL HOUSE, VICTORIA EMBANKMENT, LONDON, W.C. THE Society is the only Organisation co-extensive with, and as comprehensive as, the Church of England that has for its object ' to increase the means of pastoral instruction and superintendence;' an increase absolutely necessary if the Church is to be faithful to her Mission amidst a population increasing yearly by vast numbers. The recent census has shown that the population of England and Wales has more than doubled since the Society was founded in 1837. Each year the Society has done its utmost to provide for the maintenance of additional Mission Clergy, to minister to the large populations gathered in and around our great towns.

In the confident assurance that their endeavours to make the Society's aid com mensurate with the Church's evident needs were approved by all faithful Church- people, the Committee have been yearly extending the Society's operations. It is in the same assurance that, when the Society's own need is known, an adequate response will be forthcoming, that the present most urgent appeal is made. Without due provision for the supply and yearly maintenance of a sufficient number of Clergy, neither churches, schools, nor indeed any parochial or missionary agency can be fully utilised. Thus the vast importance to the whole Church of England of such a provision cannot be over-estimated. A very earnest appeal is therefore made to the whole body of Church-people to come forward in larger num bers and—in the case of those who already help us—with, where they can afford it, larger offerings.

Tie: IE oisr the CHURCH IN WALES THE long-threatened attack upon the Establishment and Endowment of the Church, specially directed against the four Welsh Dioceses, has at length opened, and will need to be met with energy and determination. The Committee of the Church Defence Institution earnestly invite the co operation of Churchmen, without distinction to political party, in the honourable but arduous work which lies before them. They desire to provide that no meeting in favour of Welsh Disestablishment may be held in England without an early and •effective reply by trained speakers. They propose also to circulate on the most extensive scale short and simple leaflets on the history and work of the Church and its inestimable value to the nation. It is certain that large funds will be needed to carry out their plans, and, after careful consideration, it has been decided that no less a sum than JSS3OOO a year for the next three years will suffice. But, having regard to the greatness of the interests at stake, and the far-reaching issues involved, the Committee with confidence to their fellow-Churchmen who responded with such ready liberality in 1885 to renew at this time their confidence and support.

XeltgratM—*Sanitation, (OPPOSITE TOWNIHALL.)THE NINETEENTH C ENTUET No. CLXXXII—A pril 1892 HOW TO FEDERATE A RE PL Y TO In tlie October number of tMs Review I ventured with mucli hesita tion to give my views on the question of Imperial Federation. Mine 'was not a Colonial plan, nor did I speak for Canada. Imperial Feder ation, as I then showed, did not emanate from the colonies, but was originated by a number of the leading public men of both the political parties in this country in 1884. Having devoted thirty- seven years of my life to securing to the best of my ability the perpetuation for all time of British institutions in the northern half of North America, and believing as I did that the greatness of the British Empire depended upon the retention of her colonies, I re sponded to the suggestion of Lord Salisbury that a scheme should be propounded. I may be permitted to say in excuse for my temerity that I had the honour to be one of the authors, a quarter of a century ago, of the Federation of Canada, which has surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its founders. I offered my suggestions with diffidence, and declared my readiness to abandon them if anything better could be devised. These proposals have been subjected to the most extended criticism here and in Canada and Australia, but after the most careful examination of all the objections I cannot find that I have been favoured by my critics with any alternative plan. It is satisfactory to me to know that a large portion of the •criticism to which my former article was subjected was founded upon a misapprehension of what I had written. I proposed that when V ol . XXXI—N o . 182 0 0526 THE NINET April Australasia and South Africa were each united under a central government, as Canada now is, the representatives in London of each of these great outlying portions of the Empire, being members of their respective Grovernments, should be sworn of Her Majesty's Privy Council, and thus be placed in a position to be called into consultation with the Cabinet on all questions of foreign policy affecting the countries from which they came. This has been treated as a demand from Canada, and as a great concession for the Imperial Government to make, and Lord Brassey dismisses the proposition curtly in this Review of January last by saying: ' It does not seem feasible to give seats in the Cabinet, to the Agents-General of the Colonies.' That is not what I proposed ; but for the purpose of meet ing the suggestion made by the advocates of Imperial Federation that some means of giving the colonies a voice in matters of foreign policy must be found, and of affording Her Majesty's Government the fullest information on questions vitally affecting the whole Empire, and of promoting the most perfect with what at no distant day will be Greater Britain, I ventured to propound a means by which these objects could be obtained without in the least degree conflicting with the constitution of this country or of the colonies. This proposal was first suggested by that eminent veteran statesman. Earl Grey. It has been endorsed by the Marquis of Lorne after five years' experience as Governor-General of Canada. The Right Hon. W. E. Forster said in this Review of February 1885 :— Lord Grey lias repeated in tlie Pall tlie suggestion wliicli lie made in this Review in 1879, viz. the appointment of the agents of tlie colonies as privy councillors, and their constitution as a board of advice to assist the Cabinet^ and especially the colonial secretary, in the management of colonial affairs; and Lord Lorne has further defined this suggestion, and given excellent arguments in its support. It would be difficult to find any proposal supported by so great a weight of experience as this agreement between the veteran minister who has an unmatched experience of the Colonial Office, and the man who has just returned from successful government of our largest colony. Lord Granville, when Secretary of State for the Colonies, at the dinner given to Mr. Murray Smith, the Agent-General of Victoria, said;— Mr. Murray Smith, our honoured guest, will be at home next month. In addi tion to the great personal position which he held in the estimation of his fellow- colonists when he came out, his sojourn in this country must add to the weight of his opinions. He is the type of the class of men whom the great colonies have sent out as their representatives, and who have contributed to the formation of an institution of inestimable advantage to the relations of the home country and the great dependencies of the Crown. They havebrought us into nearer touch with one another. Many mistakes which have formerly arisen through misconception on either side, either as regards the feelings of the colonies, the Imperial necessities, or international obligations, would now be unjustifiable, and ought to be impos sible.1892 HOW TO FEDERATE 521 Lord Eosebery, in his speech, on Colonial and Foreign Policy at Leeds in 1888, said:— A great change has come over the whole of our foreign policy during the last twenty years. I think you will see a greater change in the next twenty years. Our foreign policy has become more of a colonial policy, and is becoming every day more entwined with our colonial interests. Formerly our foreign policy was mainly an Indian policy—it was mainly guided by considerations of what was best for our Indian Empire. That brought us into many complications which we might otherwise have avoided, but which we felt were rightly faced to save so splendid a possession; but now, owing to causes which I will point out to you, colonial in fluences must necessarily overshadow our foreign policy. In the first place, our colonial communities are rising to a pitch of power which makes it natural for us to listen to them whenever they make representations on their own behalf; and they do make constant representations on their own behalf. In the next place, we find that the other Powers are beginning a career of colonial aggrandisement. 'We formerly did not have in our foreign affairs to trouble ourselves much with colonial questions, because we had a monopoly of colonies. That monopoly has ceased ; but consider for a moment, as matters stand now, how largely our foreign policy is a colonial policy. Why, our principal question of foreign policy at this moment may be said to be the fisheries dispute between Canada and the United States. It is difficult for some of us—it is difficult, at any rate, for myself—to consider the L nited States as a foreign power, but the United States in these colonial questions has interests totally different from ours or those of Canada, and in dealing with Canadian questions it is clear that the voice of Canada must sound loud in the councils of the Foreign Office. You are a coterminous power with Germany in the Pacific. In questions re lating to the Pacific, the voice of your colonial community in Australia must be loudly heard, the voice of Australia must be almost paramount in the councils of the Foreign Office with regard to these questions. You will have, as I think, to admit the colonies to a much larger share in your affairs than you do at present. You will have to give them aright to prompt the voice of England, when it speaks abroad, to a much greater extent than at present. Lord Derby, and Lord Stanley, the present Grovernor-General of Canada, have borne testimony to the assistance the representatives of the self-governing colonies have been to the Grovernment here in the administration of public affairs. Lord Thring, in his recent brochure on £ The Consolidation of the British Empire,' says on this point: 'The direct intervention of a colony may be secured by elevating the position of an Agent-General to one more akin to that of a Minister of a Foreign State, and giving him a facility of access to the British Government.' Who, with all this evidence before them, can doubt the advantage to the Imperial Cabinet of the fullest and freest consultation under the confidential regulations of the Privy Council with the representatives of the Governments of Canada, Australasia, and South Africa? If anyone is able to propound a more practicable means of mutual co-operation and concert in the interests of the Empire his suggestions will be welcomed. 0 0 2528 THE NINETEENTH April I now come to the question of defence. Well aware tliat the policy of levying a large tax upon the colonies for the support of the army and navy of England was one of the principal attractions of Imperial Federation with many in this country, and believing that policy to be founded on misapprehension and fraught with danger, I stated my opinion that the strength of the Empire would be better promoted by the resources of the colonies being utilised in the future, as they had been in the past, in opening up the great fields of colonisation possessed by Great Britain in Canada, South Africa, and Australasia, and providing for their local defence. As an illustration of what could be done in that way, I referred to the construction of a transcontinental line of railway by Canada at a cost to the country of over twenty-five millions sterling, and for which the people are now taxed nearly a million sterling per annum. I referred also to an average annual expenditure of fourteen hundred thousand dollars for the per manent force, for the training of 37,000 militiamen, and for the Koyal Military College, which has already provided some seventy officers for the British Army. My critics have misconstrued what I said into a state ment that the construction of this great line of railway communication was to be taken as a sufficient contribution by Canada to the defence of the Empire, and, while not venturing to deny its Imperial importance, have reminded me, that it was built for commercial purposes, and that the capital was obtained in this country! The Intercolonial Eailway was lengthened and its cost greatly increased at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, for strategic purposes, and without the Canadian Pacific Railway there could be no communication through British territory between the older provinces and the North-West and British Columbia. It was indispensable as a means of defence and mutual support. Its Imperial value is not, I submit, lessened because it opened up to settlement the great prairies of the Canadian North-West, where forty millions of British subjects may find em ployment in providing bread and meat for the people of this country. I can bear the taunt that the capital for the Canadian Pacific Rail way was found in this country when it is remembered that those who supplied it have been paid the highest rate of interest, and thus enriched, whilst those who sent their money to South America have lost it. I may say, however, that I did not refer to what Canada had done to promote the security of the Empire as in any way absolving her from further expenditure, but as an indication of her readiness to discharge her duty in this regard. I may say that I differ toto ccelo with those who are apparently striving to convince the British public that Canada is a burden to the Empire. One member of the House of Commons has avowed the opinion that the sooner England can rid herself of such an incubus the better, but I feel confident that that sentiment is not shared' by half a dozen of his fellow-members. The views of the great body of the public men1892 HOW TO FEDERATE 529 of all parties in this country on this point were well stated by Lord Eosebery in bis address to the Chamber of Commerce at Leeds:— It is not merely the commercial interests involved, it is a narrowing down of this country to its European possessions. Do not flatter yourself that if Canada and Australia were to leave you, you would retain your smaller colonies. The West Indies would go with Canada; Australia would take in Australasia. As to the Cape, I think you might well make up your mind for the secession of the Cape under circumstances such as these. Well, if you wish to remain alone in the world with Ireland you can do so. Also by Lord Salisbury in his speech at Exeter in February:— What is it that gives to this little island its commanding position ? Why is it that fleets from every nation, from every quarter of the globe, come into your ports ; that the products of countless regions are subject to your industry; and that the manufactures which the industry of your people complete are carried to the furthest corners of the globe ? What is it that gives to you this privileged position ? It is that your flag floats over populations far more numerous and regions far vaster than your own, and that upon the dominions of your sovereign the sun never sets. I yield to no one in a due appreciation of the great value to Canada of the army and navy and diplomatic service of England. But I deny that any additional burden is imposed upon this country by the possession of Canada. If the United States could accomplish their desire of having one Government from the Equator to the North Pole, and England were left without a harbour in North America into which her ships could enter in time of war, and deprived of her in valuable coal supplies, both on the Atlantic and Pacific coast, can anyone pretend that she could reduce her army by a man or her navy by a ship ? What would then become of her trade with China and Japan, and to what extent might not her Indian Empire be thus imperilled ? Canada has shown in the past the value she attaches to British institutions, and will every hour become a still greater strength to the Empire by building up and training a powerful British community to defend the connection of which she is so proud. Commercial principles and defence may be combined, as in the case of her canals [on which she has already expended over eleven millions sterling, and has incurred further liabilities], which provide the most magnificent inland navigation in the world, and will enable gunboats of large size to reach, in case of war, the head of Lake Superior. Among the measures recently sanctioned by the Parliament of this country to increase its naval strength, it will be generally admitted that the policy of securing the construction of armed cruisers like the 'Teutonic' and ' Majestic,'built under Admiralty supervision, of great speed, provided with armament, and subject to appropriation as cruisers in time of war, promises the best results in proportion to the expenditure. Canada is now pledged to appropriate 165,000£. sterling per annum to provide such a service from England530 THE NINETEENTH April to Canada, and between Canada and Australia. She has already given 15,000^ a year to the steamers between Canada and Japan and China, making a total annual sum of 180,000^ for the best form of naval defence. At a time when Canada has accomplished so much for the security of the Empire in the past, and is now struggling to secure at great cost such an important enterprise, is she to be held up to the contempt of the people of this country as not taking her fair share of the burdens of the Empire? Let me say to Sir John Colomb, who criticises in his ' Survey of Existing Conditions' the issues which occupied the people of Canada at the late general election, that when the Opposition propounded to the country, then smarting under the McKinley tariff, the policy of consulting their own interests by supporting free trade with the American Eepublic, involving the adoption of their prohibitory tariff against England, the, Government of Canada joined issue with them on that point, and went in to the battle with 'British institutions, and no discrimination against the mother country' inscribed on their banners. Their great leader. Sir John A. Macdonald, who in his seventy-sixth year braved the inclemency of a Canadian winter, fell a martyr in that struggle, but not until he had planted that flag securely upon the ramparts of his country, and had his dying hours cheered, like the immortal Wolfe, by the consciousness that victory was assured. All that I have said in regard to Canada on this question may be said in reference to Australia. If those great colonies are suffering at this moment from financial embarrassment, it is because their credit has i )een strained in a loyal endeavour to open up their country for settlement and to provide the means of defence on land and sea. I am glad to be able to inform Lord Thring that the law requires that the officer at the head of the Canadian Militia and Military Force shall be an officer of the Imperial Army, that he has always been selected by the Commander-in-Chief here, and that the Canadian Act provides that ' Whenever the militia or any part thereof is called out for active service by reason of war, invasion, or insurrection. Her Majesty may place them under the orders of the commander of her regular forces in Canada.' In my former article, after dealing with what I considered a practicable mode of giving the outlying portions of the Empire the best means of making their opinions known on questions of foreign policy affecting them, and of securing cordial co-operation between them and the Imperial Grovernment, I expressed the opinion that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be able to devise with the three representatives of Canada, Australasia, and South Africa a fiscal policy that would be mutually advantageous, and at the same time greatly promote the development of the colonies and expand the trade of England. I offered at the same time some evidence to show that a small duty on corn would not necessarily raise the price of bread.fa] V_7 1892 HOW TO FEDERATE 531 Here again I liave been greatly misunderstood, and charged by my critics with, asking everything and conceding nothing. I submit that my statement will not bear that construction, as I proposed the fiscal policy to be adopted should be settled with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on mutually advantageous terms. Long ago, in the Canadian House of Commons, I advocated the policy of a mutually pre ferential tariff between Canada and England. My mode of arranging it meets the objection raised by Mr. Groschen in a debate on this question in the House of Commons in 1891. He said : ' We ought to have securities from the colonies not merely that they would put a ■5 per cent, extra on foreigners, but that their tariff itself should be such as would be likely to protect this country from loss.' The arrangement proposed by me would give that security, as it was to be made with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It would ensure at the same time a great development in the colonies, and a corresponding expansion of the trade of this country by the increased demand for the products of British industry. No one who takes the trouble to investigate this subject can doubt the advantage of such a policy in stimulating the rapid progress of England's great fields for colonisa tion or the consequent expansion of British trade. Even as matters now stand, the truism that trade follows the flag is placed beyond controversy by the statistics of the Empire. Lord Eosebery, in the speech to which I have alluded at the Chamber of Commerce at Leeds, gives conclusive evidence on this point. He said :— The United States have taken from us~chiring tlie last ten years an average of 24,350,000/. of home produce. Their population is nearly 60,000,000, and, there fore, they have taken of our home produce at the rate of about per head. Now Canada, which, as you know, is coterminous with the United States, and which re mains to us, has taken from us on an average 7,300,000/. during the past ten years. Take their population at 6,000,000, and that gives nearly 30s. per head, or nearly four times what the United States takes from ug. ell, but, gentlemen, you may say that the United States have a more hostile tariff against us than Canada has; but, if you think for a moment, you will remember that, if Canada were to leave us, she would be pretty certain to adopt the tariff of the United States, and we should not be materially benefited by that proceeding. But let us consider the case of Australia. Australia takes from us on an average 24,260,000/., or about the same as the whole of the United States, although its population is only about 3,250,000, or at the rate of per head, being more than seventeen times more than the United States with its population of 60,000,000. Now, gentlemen, I wish to say that, on that ground of commercial interest alone, the question is worthy of the consideration of our great commercial communities. If, therefore, the effect of a duty on corn did slightly increase the cost of bread, the artisans of this country would, in my opinion, find abundant compensation in the increased employment resulting from this policy. But while my critics have challenged the accuracy of my assertion that the small duty suggested on foreign corn would not increase the price in the loaf, none of them have condescended to532 THE NINETEENTH April refute the evidence I submitted in support of that opinion. I took the prices of corn at Mark Lane for two years, and showed that ark increase of 6s. per quarter did not raise the cost of bread ; in fact, it was only when the increase reached 10s. that a halfpenny was added to the four-pound loaf. I have not seen any refutation of the clear and concise statements of Lord Dun raven on this question in this. Keviewfor March, 1891. He said :— The duty on wlieat in France in 1882 was only 2-8d. per cwt.; in 1885 it was raised to 15d. per cwt., or 536 per cent. According to some economists, the price of wlieat should have gone up in like proportion, and the masses have had to pay dearer for their bread. But what are the facts ? The price of wheat actually fell from an average of 1008s. per cwt. in 1883, the year following the low duty, to- 9-295. in 1886, the year following the increased duty, or 8 per cent. Instead of the poor man in France having to pay dearer for his bread, he paid less in 1886 than in 1883, as the following table shows Bread 1883 1884 1885 1886 d. d. d. d. First quality 1*57 1-49 1*39 1-39 Second quality . 1*35 1*26 1-17 1-22 Third quality 1*17 1-13 1-04 1-09 In Germany, too, I find the same results follow from increased duties. Wheat went down from 10 - 30s. per cwt. in 1882, when the duty was 6d. per cwt., to 9'39s. per cwt. in 1889, or 9 per cent., when the duty was 6d. per cwt., or 500 per cent, higher, while bread remained at about the same price. Internal development appears in both these cases to have more than compensated for any restriction of foreign imports, and it is only fair to remember that the resources of the British Empire in respect of food supply are immeasurably greater than those of France or Germany. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, I am aware, said a short time ago in the House of Commons : ' Supposing a duty is imposed upon these articles coming from foreign countries here, what would be the natural effect ? The price would be raised by something more than the duty. If the price was not raised, what good would it be to the colonies ?' I do not despair of convincing the President of the Board of Trade that the price would not be increased, and that the result would be an immense advantage to both Great Britain and her colonies. I respectfully submit that the price of corn is controlled not by the cost of production, of freight or insurance, or of the duty, but by the- question of demand and supply. I have already given the testimony of a gentleman well acquainted with both Canada and the United States, Sir Lyon Playfair, that in a few years the United States will have no corn for export, and that Canada will be able to supply all that now comes from that country. Mr. Staveley Hill, M.P., who has an intimate personal knowledge of the great Canadian North- West, said at a conference of the Midland Union of Conservative Associations last July:—1892 HOW TO FEDERATE 533 He knew Canada and Manitoba well, and he believed that during the next ten years they would be able to supply all that amount of grain which the population of England required, and which could not be supplied by England itself. If that was so supplemented by grain from other colonies, we should see ourselves abso lutely independent of any grain coming from Russia, the United States, France, or any other countries that put on prohibitive duty. The New York Sun in a recent issue went into a series of calcula tions wliicli show that in about seven years the surplus corn of the United States will be required for the consumption of its own population. All this points to the necessity of stimulating the pro duction of corn in India, Canada, and Australasia in such a way as fully to meet the demand in this country. The imposition of a small duty in the meantime will not stop the supply from the United States, for the best of reasons, that they have no other market so good, even if they had to add 5s. a quarter to the freight and insurance they now pay. It does not matter to the buyer whether the wheat pays ten cents freight, as it may do if grown near the sea-coast, or forty cents if grown in Manitoba. The cost of getting it to market is paid by the seller,, whether freight or duty. In 1887, wheat in London brought 3d., in 1890 4s. per bushel, a difference of 45 per cent., yet this fall in price did not lessen production. I will now endeavour to show Sir Michael Hicks-Beach how both England and the colonies may be benefited without an increase in the price. The State of Dakota, in the United States, and the Province of Manitoba lie side by side, and are both famous for the production of the finest wheat in the world. Where will the hundreds of thousands of agriculturists seeking homes annually in the New World go if the wheat raised in the Canadian North-West comes into this great mart free, while that grown in Dakota pays 5s. a quarter before it can compete with it ? In a short time a large number of men would, under these circum stances, take their capital and industry to build up Canada, who would otherwise go under a foreign flag instead of becoming a source of wealth and strength to the Empire. But what will be the effect upon the artisans of this country ? Let me answer that question in the words of Sir William Leng at a recent meeting of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce. He said :— In other words, one Australian settler, with a wife and three children, is about as good a customer as sixty Americans, seventy-five Germans, or seventy French men. One million such families would be worth as much to British labour as the whole American nation. Twenty shillings' worth of colonial produce secures a demand for nineteen shillings' worth of British labour products. Every quarter of wheat imported from Australia secures from fifteen to twenty times the trade and employment a quarter of American wheat does; and every quarter from Canada thirty-five times as much as one from Eussia. I think I have shown that the price would not be increased by the- imposition of the duty, but even if it were it would be to an insig-534 THE NINETEENTH CEN April nificant extent, and the consuirier could be relieved in other ways. Mr. Chaplin, the Minister of Agriculture, laid a return upon the table of the House of Commons in April 1891, which showed that the duty of Is. per quarter remitted in 1869 had caused no decrease in the price of bread, and that if it had been continued it would have produced over 2,000,000^. of revenue in 1890. It is, therefore, obvious that the pro posed duty would furnish the Chancellor of the Exchequer with the means of reducing the duty on foreign teas and coffee to a much greater extent than would meet any possible enhanced cost of bread. One objection has been raised to which I am almost ashamed to allude, and that is, that the United States would resent such a policy and retaliate. I am not surprised that Mr. Carnegie, whose great desire is to see Canada forced to become part of the United States, should attack any policy calculated to consolidate the Empire. How could they retaliate ? Would they refuse to send their wheat to the best market they could still find in the world ? They would cease to be Americans if they did. Can they adopt a tariff more prohibitory, either to Canada or England than the McKinley Act ? I am glad to see that the Chancellor of the Exchequer repudiates this humiliating doctrine. On the 17th of February, 1891, he used the following language in the House of Commons :— I think it possible that the advantages of the consolidation of the Empire may be so great that, if the increase in the price of the loaf is extremely small, the pro ducers, with whom the power now lies far more than with the consumers, may not object. I differ from the right honourable member for Leeds, who supposed that if we had any customs union or arrangement by which favour was shown to the colonies, that the United States would have a right to interfere. I do not think the United States would have a right to remonstrate or interfere in the way he suggested. The right honourable member suggested England would be brought to her knees, but I must enter my protest against such an extreme view, that under no circum stances could we make any arrangements with our colonies without bringing in the other bread-producing countries. If we find we could make the whole Em pire one as regards customs, surely we have the same right of Zollverein Union as Grermany has with Bavaria, or the United States among themselves. I claim for ourselves the same right. The Earl of Aberdeen, in a speech at Toronto lately, said :— The price of the loaf of bread need not rise higher by the imposition of a slight preference duty, though the middleman would probably have to reduce his margin of profits. I. mean a low tax, such as finds an analogy in a revenue tax. Such, I think, should not give offence to any nation, seeing how it would only apply to in tegral if autonomous parts of the British Empire. As a strong free-trader and an advanced Liberal, I think such moderate discrimination as I have described would be practicable in the near future if judiciously introduced and applied. The idea of a federation of Imperial interests is a vast project, worthy of the study of the best of our men at home and abroad. All the self-governing colonies have united in urging upon the1892 ROW TO FEDER 535 Imperial Government the removal of a clause in the treaties with Belgium and Germany which prevents any closer fiscal relations between England and her colonies than those between them and foreign countries, and Lord Salisbury has expressed the hope that an opportunity may arise of getting rid of those ' unfortunate' provisions. No other country in the world is prevented making the closest fiscal relations they desire within their own possessions. Sir Albert Eollit, M.P., submitted the following resolution to the meeting of the Associated Chambers of Commerce at Dublin last autumn, which passed unanimously :— That, in the opinion of this Association, it is expedient that practical arrange ments should, if possible, he devised to secure closer commercial union between the mother country and her colonies and dependencies, and that the Chambers heartily approve of the forthcoming Congress of Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, as conducing towards this important end; also that the Association will do its best to obtain through its chambers and otherwise the commercial and statistical information necessary to a determination of the questions involved, and authorises its council to appoint a committee for this purpose, if it should deem it desirable to do so. In his able speech on that occasion he said :— 'What is the commercial aspect of this Imperial question ? I say, without hesitation, that the colonies and dependencies of England are those which give us not only the most secure portion of our trade, but which, taken as a whole, con tribute the largest proportion towards it. Of our exports, the colonies take one- third, as compared with all other nations of the world, and of our imports they contribute one-fourth. At the conference at Birmingham of the National Union of Con servative Associations in November last, attended by a large number of members of Parliament, the following resolution was carried by a large majority:— That the principle advocated by the United Empire Trade League, favouring the extension of commerce upon a' preferential basis throughout all parts of the British Empire, will be of the highest collective and individual advantage: and, further, that the provision of any treaties imposing limitations upon the full &lt;j0YQjopment of trade between the United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empire should be abrogated; and this conference expresses the earliest expecta tion that Her Majesty's Government will see their way clear before the next elec tion campaign to make some decisive declaration of their intention to endeavour to promote mutually favouring customs arrangements between the colonies and the home country. The charge has been made against this policy that it is an aban donment of Free Trade principles, but Lord Salisbury has made an authoritative declaration that preferential fiscal arrangements within the Empire do not involve the principle of protection. It has also been objected that there is no evidence that the colonies would support such a policy. The enthusiasm with which Colonel Howard Vincent was received throughout Canada is conclusive as regards that country.536 THE NINETEENTH April The action taken by all the Agents-General in their appeal to Her Majesty's Government to abrogate the clauses preventing preferential arrangements in those two treaties leaves no reason to doubt the feeling of the Australasian colonies. The present moment is not favourable for the discussion of this question. But, after the im pending struggle which now absorbs attention here is over, what ever may be the issue, the importance of this subject will force itself upon the public mind irrespective of party, with the result, I trust, of consolidating the strength and increasing the prosperity of this great Empire. Charles Tuppek.1892 537 PROSPECTS OF MARRIAG A century has passed since Mary Wollstonecraft publislied her Viudication of the Rights of Woyna and Maria Edgeworth, with greater tact and knowledge of the world, pleaded for the higher education of women in her Lettevs Whatever views we may hold as to the change, there can be no doubt that the modes of thought and of life of women in all classes have altered considerably, for good or for evil, in the last hundred years. It is, however, possible to exaggerate the change, and to be mistaken both as to its causes and its resulting tendencies; and now that there are signs of a new departure, it may be as well to take stock and consider how we stand at present. First and foremost the question presents itself. How do women stand now with regard to that all-absorbing occupation obtained through marriage ? Their position in industry is so vitally affected by their attitude towards marriage, and by the attitude of those around them, they are so constantly called upon to balance an in dustrial gain with social loss, that before all things it is necessary to see on what the expectation of marriage is grounded and the effect produced by it on efficiency and wages. After marriage we should estimate not so much the effect of marriage on industrial posi tion, but rather the effect of industry on domestic life. In calculating the possibilities of marriage on a statistical basis, the method is frequently adopted of subtracting all the widows from the population and pointing out that in the remainder (the widowers not being subtracted) there is a slight surplus of men; the moral is drawn that every woman can get married if she will only make herself agreeable, and not be too particular. Putting aside the practical objection that all men are not able to support a wife, and the sentimental one that numerical equality does not guarantee mutual attraction, this method of calculation ignores several important facts. One of these is the preference that men feel for women younger than themselves as wives and that women feel for men older than them selves as husbands. Granted an equal number of males and females between the ages of eighteen and thirty, we have not therefore in English society an equal number of marriageable men and women. Wherever rather late marriage is the rule with men, that is wherever538 THE NINETEENTH CEN April tliere is a high standard of comfort, the disproportion is correspond ingly great. In a district where boy-and-girl marriages are very common, everybody can be married and be more or less miserable ever after; but in the upper middle class equality in numbers at certain ages implies a surplus of marriageable women over marriage able men. Nor do equal numbers at the same age imply equal numbers in the same locality. Women's work and mens work can not always be found in equal proportions in the same district; and class habits may affect the stream of migration differently. The daughters of working-men go out to service or emigrate, while the daughters of well-to-do people stay at home ; while, on the other hand, the percentage of sons of professional men who go to the colonies Oi to India is probably much greater than the percentage of sons of working-men. There is a probability, therefore, that the sexes will be distributed unequally in different districts and also in different classes of society. Taking the Census returns for 1881, and comparing England and Wales with London, we find that, whereas in the former there were 105 females to 100 males, in the latter there were 112 females to 100 males. Here at once we have a marked local difference, and if we take special districts of London and compare them with each other we shall find a greater disparity. 2881, — Number of Females 100 Kensing ton Hackney Islington L ONDON St. Pan- eras Shore- ditch Bethnal Green White- chapel 1 All ages 149-8 122-4 113-3 112-3 109-9 105-2 102-9 9Jf'3 1 Under 6 '1 99-9 102-0 97-9 999 97-2 102-3 99-1 108-6 years j i 5-10 105-1 103-3 100-4 101-1 104-5 101-3 98-6 101-9 10-15 122-1 110-2 104-3 103-9 105-4 102-2 102-5 102-1 15-20 172-9 1450 123-4 114-7 107-3 98-3 1 98-1 1 100-0 j 20-25 195-9 142-3 1189 112-9 108-5 104-5 101-7 83-0 i 25-30 187-2 128-1 115-3 1107 109-4 1008 105-0 82-1 30-35 171-9 1200 111-9 114-5 108-1 102-7 102-5 82 35-45 152-2 X18'9 1X1-7 lll'S 110-3 104-8 101-5 89.4 1 45-55 153-6 125-1 120-4 117-0 118-3 111-6 110-8 ! on According to Mr. Charles Booth's classification in Life,' 1 Kensington has 30'4 per cent, of middle and upper class people 1 I have made no attempt to estimate the error introduced into the Census by- falsehood. 2 For brevity I use the letters assigned by Mr. Booth to the various classes with the signification he has attached to them, viz.: Poor.

Whitechapel is set apart from the res ? moot piobably by the peculiar effects of the Jewish immigration. 1 utting aside for the moment the question whether the preponder ance is entirely due to the servant class, there can be little doubt that it is connected with the servant-keeping classes. Between the ages of 35 and 45 the merely migrant portion of the community seem to have disappeared, large numbers of shop-assistants, domestic servants, &amp;c. having married and settled down amongst their own class. Between these ages but a small percentage of unmarried people marry; they are, or should be, in the prime of life, and for several reasons it is the period to notice, especially in estimating the proportion of men or women who remain unmarried. It is difficult to decide whether we should compare the number of unmarried women with the number of married women only, or with the number of married women and widows. If our object is to find the percentage of women who marry, widows should be included with married women ; if we wish to estimate the number of women who may have to support themselves, a large number of widows should be added to the number of spinsters. Except for the age- period from 3o to 45, widows are not considered here at all. 3 1881. TJuinavviedy TP owwti to 100 JMavvied TVoiucu. En eiand &amp; Wales : Kensing ton 1 • 1 I j Hackney.

Men in the wealthier districts who return themselves as single, although supporting women in another class, should be regarded as married; but the women themselves for the present purpose are rightly treated as married or widowed in accordance with their Census returns.540 the nineteenth April are due to a preponderance of male immigrants over female immi grants of a race whicli prevents inter-marriage with the English population. England and Wales takes its place, so far as the ratio at the age of 35 to 45 is concerned, after Pancras, from which the inference may be drawn that London either possesses a larger per centage of the servant-keeping classes, or that these classes employ more servants than is the case in England and Wales. ^ Both the tables show that we are right in selecting the age-period 35-45, when men and women have left off marrying, and have not begun dying, for special study in connection with industry or marriage. In all England and Wales, then, the proportion of women who may be expected to remain unmarried is, roughly speaking, one in six; in London it is one in five. The important question arises, Are these chances equally distributed ? On the face of it, it would seem not; but people readily point out that the greater ratio of middle-aged spinsters in Kensington, Hackney, and Islington, as compared with Shoreditch or Bethnal Green, is easily explained by the number of servants who naturally, if unmarried at this age, con gregate in the richer districts, but would, if distributed among the working-class districts, make the ratios fairly equal. The explanation sounds so plausible, that, were it not that experience has convinced me that in the educated middle class there is a surplus of women over men above the average, I should have accepted.it without further inquiry. But by a study of the Census for 1861 (in many respects an ideal one so far as the tabulation of facts is concerned) and of the unpublished official returns of 1881 for Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Hackney, and Kensington, I find that, supposing all the middle-aged indoor domestic servants to be single, they never theless are not more than one-third of the single women in each district. Of the outdoor domestic servants, such as charwomen, the percentage under 25 years of age is so very small that it may fairly be assumed that the great majority are married women or widows, and that the exceptions to this rule will be balanced by the excep tions to the rule that the middle-aged indoor domestic servants are single women. Shoreditch and Bethnal Green (with almost exactly equal populations) give us together a ratio of 11-6 unmarried women between 35 and 45 to 100 married women at that age as the normal for a working-class district without any upper middle class. Ken sington (including Paddington), with a population of 270,000, contains 70 per cent, of working-class inhabitants; the surplus women, whether servants or otherwise, are to be found in the houses of the 30 per cent, of middle and upper-class inhabitants. Koughly speaking, then, to every 70 working-class married women in Kensington we may assign 8 unmarried women, and to the remaining 30 married women between 35 and 45 years of age we must assign 54 unmarried women. To every 76 working-class married women in Hackney we may assign 91892 PROSPECTS OF MARRIA 541 unmarried women at this age-period, leaving 18 unmarried women to the remaining 24 married women. One-third of these beino- domestic servants, if we subtract them, we have left in Kensington in Classes Gf and H 36 unmarried women to 30 married women, and in Hackney 12 unmarried women to 24 married women. It 'follows, therefore, that in Kensington, excluding domestic servants, more than 50 per cent, of the women between 35 and 45 in the servant-keeping classes are unmarried, while in Hackney about 33 per cent, of the same class are unmarried. The servant-keeping classes, as I have described the groups that Mr. Booth has called Classes G and H, include everyone with an income of 150L a year or upwards, and, were statistics available, it might perhaps be shown that the unmarried women are, to a large extent, the daughters of clerks and professional men. The tradesman class do not find it nearly so difficult to provide for their sons and set them up in business as is the case in the salaried class; and it is an advantage from an industrial point of view for tradesmen to have wives who can help them in various ways. Emigration is probably more frequent in the salaried class ; and where the sons are obliged to emigrate, it frequently happens that the daughters have to work for their living. In this class I believe the inequality of the sexes is greatest, and the probability of marriage least. In this class, therefore, the importance of an industrial training which shall enable women to earn a com petency through all the active years of their life, which shall enable them to remain efficient workers and to provide for old age, is greater than in any other. As my object is not to point out how marriageable women may get married, but to show that a considerable number of women must remain unmarried, a table showing the inequality of numbers of the unmarried of both sexes in different districts in London is given. The districts are arranged in the order of poverty as calculated in 1889 ; the figures are from the Census of 1881. Unmarried Holborn St. George's-in-Ea; Bethnal Green St. Saviour's St. Olave's .

Such being the case, we can afford to dispense with mutual recrimination. The women who find it less dishonouring to enter the labour market than an overstocked marriage market are taking the more womanly course in putting aside all thought of marriage. The men who remain unmarried are perhaps in the position of Captain Macheath, overwhelmed by an eTixbctTTCis richesses, and should be forgiven if they fear to make a choice of one which may seem to cast disparagement on so many others of equal merit. These statistics have been called startling and alarming. They may be startling to men, but can hardly be so to women of the upper class, and I fail to see why they should alarm anyone. If all these spinsters had to be shut up in convents the outlook would be gloomy. But as things are, if only we can secure good pay and decent con ditions of life, the lot of all women may be immensely improved by this compact band of single women. It would be difficult to overrate the industrial effect of a number of well-instructed, healthy-minded, vigorous permanent spinsters. A man's work is not interrupted but rather intensified by marriage; but in the case of women, not only is the wages question very much affected by the expectation of marriage, but much organised effort on their part, whether for im provement of wages or for provision against sickness and old age, must be wasted unless there be a considerable number of single women to give continuity to the management of their associations. Mr. Llewellyn Smith has pointed out that, as mobility of labour in creases, actual movement may, other things remaining the same, diminish; and so also I should be inclined to say that it is not marriage that is such a disturbing element in the women's wages question so much as the expectation of or desire for marriage. In the middle classes, where it is impossible to earn a sufficient income without a long training and years of practical apprenticeship, nothing is so injurious to women's industrial position as this ungrounded ex pectation of marriage, which prevents them from making themselves efficient when young, and makes them disappointed, weary, and old when their mental and physical powers should be in their prime. With this profession of faith in the absolute necessity for the existence of single women I pass on to a brief review of the position of working women, considered in three groups, taking first of al those who belong to the classes whom Mr. Booth describes as ' poor. Classes A, B, C, and D, who are 30*7 per cent, of the population of London; then the well-to-do artisans in Classes E and F, who are 51*5 per cent., and lastly the so-called middle and upper classes, who arefcf V 1892 PROSPECTS OF MARRIA 543 17 8 per cent, of London, and sliould therefore be designated the upper classes. From the first of these groups are drawn the lower grades of factory girls in East London, who form the majority of match-girls, rope-makers, jam- and sweetstuff-makers, and a considerable propor tion of the box-, brush-, and cigar-makers, as well as of the less skilled tailoresses. The children when they leave school do not all go to work at once, but relieve their mothers or elder sisters of the charge of the ubiquitous baby, enabling the former nurse to go to the factory. They stagger about with their charges, orplant them securely on the coldest stone step they can find, and discuss with each other or with the nursing mothers in their narrow street the births, deaths, marriages, misfortunes, and peculiarities of their neighbours. Their families live in one or, at most, two rooms, and their knowledge of life is such as to render Bowdlerised versions of our authors quite unnecessary. Sometimes the children take ' a little place' as servant girl, going home at night, but e\ entually, and generally before they are fifteen, they find their way to the factory. By the time they are one-and- twenty, at least a quarter of them have babies of their own to look after; during the next five years the rest, with but few exceptions, get married or enter into some less binding union. To show that I do not exaggerate the proportion of girl marriages in this class, I give a table of the number of girls married under 21 years of age in every 100 marriages that took place in the seven years from 1878 to 1884. The percentage has been calculated for each year, and the mean of the percentages is given. Girls married under 21 years of age 100 marriages 1878-1884.

At the Ked Church, in the supposed interests of morality, marriage is made cheap in every sense of the word, and several boys and girls get married there who do not belong to the district. There p p 2544 THE NINETEENTH April must be some similar cause at work, with which I am unacquainted, in Mile End to explain its high percentage, which is only less than that of Bethnal Green. The peculiarly high position assigned by Mr. Booth to Mile End in the scale of comfort is due to the fact that Mile End contains a higher percentage of well-to-do artisans than any other division in London; if classified according to its percentage of Classes G and H, it would take its place among the poorest districts. As girl marriages are more common among the poorer half of East London, and as, unfortunately, in a large number of cases, the legal ceremony only takes place, if it takes place at all, in time to legitimise the offspring of the union, it is obvious that girl marriage is extremely common in the class of which I am speaking. When the husband earns regular wages, even though they may be small, the wife does- not as a rule go to the factory, nor even take work out to do at home, for the first few years of her married life. But many factory girls return to work the day after they are married, and those who leave it for several years often return as soon as one of the children is old enough to leave school. Married labour is, of course, irregular labour, and many employers discourage it as much as possible. But it is most to be deprecated on account of the effect on the children. It is unfortunate that the Census returns, as at present tabulated, give us no means of estimating the extent of the evil. We do not need to know whether men engaged in different occupations are married or single; but there is no fact of more importance with regard to female labour, and the value of such a return would more than balance the expense. The factories where the work cannot be given out (as is the case in match, jam, and cigar factories^) contain the laigestpeicentage of married women ; and if called upon to choose the less of two evils, married labour in the factory and home work, I should unhesitatingly decide in favour of home work, which, if well organised, need not even be an evil. The great need of this class is training for domestic life, by which I do not mean domestic service. Herein lies the only effective cure for the industrial and social miseries of the poor. The children are overworked, or else allowed to spend their time in a most dangerous idleness. That men should ask for an Eight Hours Bill when little girls of thirteen or fourteen may be found in our factories working ten hours seems unwise, if not selfish. Ten hours in a factory is not so wearing to a child as eight hours in school would be, but it is far too long. It makes education impossible, and leaves no room for surprise that married women in the poorest classes sink into a con dition hardly above animalism. The two things which struck me most in East London were the amount of wasted intelligence and talent among the girls and the wretchedness of the married women. A secondary education in cooking, cleaning, baby management, laws of health, and English literature, should follow that of the Board1892 PROSPECTS OF MARRIAGE 545 School, and the minimum age at which fall time may be worked should be gradually raised. By 1905 no one under sixteen should be working for an employer more than five hours a day, and all half-timers should be attending afternoon school. The dock labourers' wives, having learnt to be useful at home, would appreciate how much is lost by going out to work. Their withdrawal from the labour market and the increased efficiency of their children, brought about by better home management and education, would both tend to raise wages, provided that a trade union existed to secure that the workers should keep the result of their increased efficiency. Bad cooking, dirty habits, overcrowding, and empty-headedness are the sources of the drunkenness, inefficiency, immorality, and brutality which obstruct progress among so many of the poor, and philanthropic efforts can be better employed in this direction than in any other. During the last four years, the trade-union movement, for which Mrs. Paterson worked so unwearyingly and with such dishearteningly small success, has made considerable progress in East London amongst this group. The principal results to be expected from trade-unionism amongst these workers are not sufficiently obvious for large numbers to be attracted by them. But even a small union can be most useful in guarding against reductions and in bringing public opinion to bear upon employers who allow their foremen to exercise tyranny and make unfair exactions from their workpeople. The usefulness of a trade-union must be estimated in many cases by what it prevents from happening rather than by any positive advantage that it can be proved to have secured. From the second group of working women are drawn our better- paid factory girls, our tailoresses, domestic servants, and a large number of our dressmakers and milliners, shop-assistants, barmaids, clerks, and elementary teachers. A considerable number of dress makers, shop-assistants and clerks are, however, drawn from the lower middle class, and a few from the professional class. Although this second group is the largest group in London, and probably in England, it is the one about which we have least general information. They have hardly been made the subject of industrial inquiry, do not regard themselves as persons to be pitied, and work in comparatively small detachments. They are nevertheless of more industrial impor tance than the working women of the first group. Their work is skilled and requires an apprenticeship. They are in the majority of eases brought into direct contact with the consumer, and education, good manners, personal appearance and tact, all raise their market value. In this second group would be included the majority of the Lancashire and Yorkshire weavers by anyone competent to deal with England as a whole, and what applies to the group in London would not apply to this section of it, who occupy a unique position. The extent to which women compete with men is very much exaggerated.546 THE NINETEENTH April Of the three million and a half women and girls who were returned as occupied in industry in 1881 in England and Wales, over one-third were domestic indoor servants, 358,000 were dressmakers, milliners, or stay makers; midwifery and subordinate medical service, charing, washing and bathing service, hospitals and institutions, shirt-making and sewing employed another 400,000. The textile trades employed altogether only 590,624 women and girls, and of these over 300,000 were in the cotton trade. Their aggregation in large factories and in special localities has attracted to them an undue amount of attention, and the history of industry in Lancashire is often given, as the history of industry in England, whereas no other county is less typical. In London in 1881 the number of women and girls occupied in industry was 593,226. Of these, more than 40 per cent, were indooi domestic servants, more than 12 per cent, were engaged in charing, washing and bathing service and hospital and institution service, 16 per cent, in dressmaking, millinery, stay-making, shirt-making and needlework ; and of the remaining miscellaneous trades, a large pro portion are purely women's trades 5 even in those where men are employed women and girls are rarely to be found doing the same work as men. Of domestic servants and charwomen there is no need to speak here. Of the laundresses a considerable proportion belong to the first group already discussed, but the ironers generally belong to the second group. An inquiry into their position with regard to wages, hours and sanitary conditions of work is about to be made, and the proposal to bring them under the Factory Acts cannot be considered until the results have been given us. Of the wages and hours of work of dressmakers and shop-assistants surprisingly little information is at present available. But one fact is too common to be denied: these girls accept wages which would not be enough to support them if they had not friends to help them; and they endure hard work, long hours, and close rooms because they believe that they are only filling up a brief interval before marriage. The better off their parents may be, the less heed do they give to securing anything but pocket-money wages. These girls are constantly coming in contact with the rich, and have ever before their eyes the luxury and comfort of those who have money without working for it. They are taught to think much about dress and personal appearance, and are exposed to tempta tions never offered to the less attractive factory girls. They have naturally a higher standard of living, their parents cannot be relied upon to help them after the first few years, and, failing marriage, the future looks intensely dreary to them. There would be little harm in the high standard of comfort of single men in the middle and upper classes which makes them regard marriage as involving self- denial, if working women all along the line were also earning enough to make them regard it in the same light. In a class more than any1892 PROSPECTS OF MARRIAGE 547 other liable to receive proposals of a dishonouring union, •which may free them from badly paid drudgery, the greatest effort should be made to secure good wages. Combination is nowhere so much needed, and perhaps is nowhere so unpopular. And yet the difficul ties of foreign competition which make attempts to raise wages among factory girls so unsafe, and which make it most undesirable for outsiders, ignorant of trade circumstances, to spread the ' doctrine of divine discontent,' are entirely absent here; skilled hands are not so plentiful that they could easily be replaced, and the girls, if assisted by their friends, could well afford to bide their time quietly at home until they had secured good terms. There is no hard-and-fast line separating any group of workers from another. If social distinctions divide population into horizontal sections, industry cuts through these sections vertically. Class Gr or the lower middle class enter the upper branches of the industries to which I have referred. The girls here do not enter the factories or become domestic servants to any extent worth considering. They form the majority of the shop-assistants in the 'West End and the richer suburbs, and more than any other class supply the elementary schools with teachers. It is as teachers, and also as Civil Service clerks, that they join the upper middle class, including under that term the professional, manufacturing, and trading classes. In treat ing of this third group of working women I shall confine myself entirely to the position of women in Class H, partly because my experience as a high-school teacher has brought me into special relations with girls and women of that class who have to earn their living; and partly because their unconscious even more than their conscious influence on the habits and ideals of the girls in the lower middle class is very great. In every class but Class H the girls can, if they choose, enter in dustries conducted by employers with a view to profit. In the section of the factory class, where the girls are obliged to be self-supporting, there is a point below which wages cannot fall for any considerable period; there is a point above which it would not pay the employers to employ them. The standard of living is unfortunately a very low one, and the wages are low; but single women in this class can support themselves so long as they are in work. In the second group there is again a maximum height to which wages might be pushed by combination; so long as it is profitable to employ them they will be employed, however high the w T ages demanded may be. But the minimum wage is not equivalent to the cost of living, but is rather determined by the cost of living minus the cost of house-room and part of the cost of food. In Class H women are not employed to produce commodities which have a definite market value, and have therefore no means of measuring their utility by market price. They nearly all perform services for persons who pay them out of fixed51:8 THE NINETEENTH April income, and make no pecuniary profit by employing them. And there is no rate at which we can say that the supply of these services will cease ; for the desire to be usefully employed is so strong in educated women, and their opportunities of being profitably employed (in the economic sense of the word profitable) are so few, that they will give their services for a year to people as well off as themselves in return for a sum of money barely sufficient to take them abroad for a month or to keep them supplied with gloves, lace, hats, and other necessary trifles. Chaos reigns supreme. And while in this class it seems to be considered ignoble to stipulate for good pay, strangely enough it is not considered disgraceful to withhold it. Teachers are constantly exhorted to teach for love of their work, but no appeal is made to parents to pay remunerative fees because they love their children to be taught. The children of the upper and middle classes have their educa tion partly given them by the parents of the assistant mistresses and governesses whom they employ. As a proof of this, I give a few par ticulars about the salaries and cost of living of the only section of educated working women in which some kind of order reigns, assist ant mistresses in public and proprietary schools giving a secondary education. In these schools, of which a considerable number are under the management of the Girls' Public Day Schools Company and the Church Schools Company, while others are endowed schools or local proprietary schools, some University certificate of intellectual attain ment is almost invariably demanded, and a University degree is more frequently required than in private schools or from private governesses. These assistant mistresses have nearly all clearly recognised, even when mere schoolgirls, that they must eventually earn their own living if they do not wish to spend their youth in maintaining a shabby ap pearance of gentility. They regard marriage as a possible, but not very probable, termination of their working career; but for all practical purposes relegate the thought to the unfrequented corners of their minds, along with apprehensions of sickness or old age and expecta tions of a legacy. They are women whose standard is high enough for them to be able to spend 2001. a year usefully without any sinful waste. In the majority of cases they are devoted to their profession for the first few years at least; and they only weary of it when they feel that they are beginning to lose some of their youthful vitality, and have no means of refreshing mind and body by social intercourse and invigorating travel, while at the same time the fear of sickness and poverty is beginning to press on them. There are not 1,500 of them in all England, and their position is better than that of any considerable section of the 120,000 women teachers entered in the Census of 1881. The particulars that I give are from the report of a committee formed in 1889 to collect statistics as to the salaries paid to1892 PROSPECTS OF MARRIA 549 assistant mistresses in high schools. The critics of the report believe that the poorest paid teachers did not give in returns, and that the report gave too favourable an impression of the state of affairs. The number who gave information was 278. The return for the hours of work did not include the time spent in preparation of lessons and study, both of course absolutely necessary for a good teacher. Summing up tlie results, we may say that, of tlie teachers wlio joined their present school more than two years ago, one-fourth are at present receiving an average salary of 82L for an average week's work'(the average including very large variations) of thirty-two hours; half (25 per cent, of whom possess University degrees) are receiving an average salary of 118L for a week's work of about thirty- five hours ; and one-fourth (50 per cent, of whom are University graduates) are receiving an average salary of 1601. in exchange for a week's work of thirty-six to thirty-seven hours. These results do not appear unsatisfactory, but it must be re membered that under the phrase more than is covered a length of service •extending in one case to as many as seventeen years, and of which the average must be taken as very nearly six. Many also of these teachers have had consider able experience in other schools before entering the one in which they are at present -engaged. The condition of the teaching profession as a career for educated women may be summed up according to these averages, by saying that a teacher •of average qualifications, who a few years ago obtained a footing in a high-class school, and has continued working in the for six years, at the end of this time is hypothetically earning a salary of 118Z. a year by thirty-five hours' work a week for thirty-nine weeks in the year, or slightly over Is. an hour. A result obtained from so many averages is, of course, entirely valueless as a guidance to any individual teacher, but affords a certain index to the pecuniary position of the profession as a whole. The prospects of the assistant mistress as she approaches middle age may be judged from the particulars of twenty-four instances in which a change of work had been attended by a fall of income. Three of these changes may be at once struck out as changes from the post of private governess, and three others do not lend themselves to easy comparison, be cause of great differences in the hours of work. Of the remaining eighteen teachers, five have now attained a higher salary than that formerly paid them, four have exactly regained their old income, while nine are still in receipt of a lower salary than that paid them at their last school. These figures point to a precari- ousness in the position of teachers which has to be seriously taken into account in ■estimating the prospects of the profession. But there are many people who, like a certain clergyman's wife, think that girls are getting ' uppish nowadays ' when they hear that after three years at Girton and two years' experience in teaching an assistant mistress refuses less than 1201. a year. There are thousands of mothers like one who wanted a lady graduate as daily governess for her boys quite regardless of expense, and who was even willing to pay 301. a year. Wealthy residents of Netting Hill and Kensington send their children to high schools whose managers dare not ask more than a maximum fee of 151. a year. For their enlightenment I550 THE NINETEENTH April give the tables of cost of living compiled by Mr. Alfred Pollard with the aid of experts. Arithmeticians may amuse themselves with calculating in how many years a teacher, twenty-six years of age, with a salary of 120^., may, by saving 16^. a year, secure an annuity of 70£. a year; and may then attack the more interesting problem of the probabilities of any school retaining her in its employment for that length of time.

And attention may be especially called to the magnificent sum that can be set apart for educational books and lectures. Frivolous books, such as the works of Walter Scott, Thackeray, George Eliot, George Meredith, Browning, E . L. Stevenson, must be presented by friends or borrowed in all their grime and dirt from a free library. If this is the position of a favoured thousand, the position of the rest may be inferred. Of the whole number, however, a considerable proportion are teachers in elementary schools, and do not come from Class H. I have no means of separating the two. Imagination may be stimulated by perusing the employment columns of such a paper as The Lady, where advertisements appear for governesses at uncon scionably low salaries, reaching occasionally to almost a minus quantity when some more than ordinarily audacious matron offers a comfortable home to a governess in return for the education of her children and twelve shillings a week. Are girls worth educating ? Apparently not, as their parents do1892 PROSPECTS OF MARRIA 551 not think them worth paying for. The expectation that marriage will in a few years after a girl leaves school solve all difficulties and provide for her is at the root of all the confusion. Fathers who know they can make no provision for their daughters make no attempt to train them for really lucrative employment, because they think the money will be thrown away if their daughters marry ; they let them work full time for half or less than half the cost of living, out of a mistaken kindness, of which employers get all the benefit. The girls in many cases accept low salaries under the same impression, in others because they are not strong enough to hold out where so many are willing to undersell them. Those who only take up employ ment as a stopgap until marriage never become really efficient, and when later on they find that there is no prospect of release, they become positively inefficient. Those who have faced facts from the first can throw their whole heart into their work, but they are heavily handicapped in their efforts towards progress by the bad pay which is the result of the thoughtlessness and folly of those around them. If only the relatives of these girls could realise that at least one-half of them will never be married, and that of the others many will not marry for several years after leaving school, that there is no means of predicting which of them will be married, and that any of them may have to support, not only themselves all their lives, but a nurse as well in old age, the tangle would soon be unravelled. Two things only I would venture to suggest. One, that instead of supplementing salaries and so lowering them, parents should help their daughters to hold out for salaries sufficient to support them, should assist them in making themselves more efficient, and should help them to make provision for themselves in later life, instead of making self-support impossible. The other, that manufacturers and business men should train their daughters as they train their sons. The better organisation of labour should open a wide field for women, if they will only consent to go through the routine drudgery and hardship that men have to undergo. An educated girl who goes from the high school to the technological college will find full scope for any talents she may possess. As designer, chemist, or foreign correspondent in her father's factory she could be more helpful and trustworthy than any one not so closely interested in his success. As forewoman in any factory, if she understood her work, she would be far superior to the uneducated man or woman, and some of the worst abuses in our factory system would be swept away. If anyone objects that women who are intensely interested in work which also enables them to be self-supporting are less attractive than they would otherwise be, I can make no reply except that to expect a hundred women to devote their energies to attracting fifty men seems slightly ridiculous. If the counter-argument be put forward552 THE NINETEENTH April that women, able to support themselves in comfort, and happy in their work, will disdain marriage, then those who take this view are maintaining, not only that it is not true that Man's love is of man's life, a thing apart; 'Tis ■woman's whole existence, but also that marriage has naturally very much less attraction for women than for men. C laea E. C ollet.1892 553 CHICAGO AND IT A brilliant English writer lias described Chicago as a ' purposeless hell.' At certain periods of the summer, the second half of the de scription is not without justification; but in what respect Chicago or its population lacks purpose, I am at a loss to imagine. The collec tive purpose of Chicago is to become the biggest city on the earth. The individual purpose of every citizen of Chicago is to make the greatest possible number of dollars in the shortest possible space of time. The individual very frequently succeeds. The community is in a fair way to success. To the average Englishman, Chicago is not much more than a name, representing a big city, right in the middle of the United States, probably unfinished, very rough and uncomfortable, possess ing for its chief public institutions pork factories, where hogs are converted into bacon by machinery at some unknown rapidity cal culated in pigs per minute. We have all heard of the great fire, we have all admired the recuperative pluck which built a new city on the still smoking ruins of the old, but on the whole we know very little about that new city, and what we do know is generally in correct. There is, of course, a large class of Englishmen whose business takes them to the States, and who know Chicago as they know New York, or London, or Birmingham, or Berlin. There are also the globe-trotters. A large number of these go to Chicago. They cannot help it, it is on the way to so many places. Many of them, when they come back, write books, most of which are reviewed, and some are read. They generally describe the loathsome scenes of the stock-yards, and the horrors connected with the mechanical slaughter ing of pigs. They expatiate on the size of the hotels, give us a few uninteresting statistics of the population and the trade, and then flit away to the more congenial description of details of Mormon estab lishments in Salt Lake City, or picturesque beauties of the Yosemite and the Golden Grate. Putting aside, however, the travellers, professional and amateur, I do not think I am far wrong in attributing to my countrymen a very general ignorance about the Grreat Lake City of the 'V\ est.554 THE NINETEENTH April To the iiiliabitants of Chicago this ignorance is naturally irritat ing. It must be admitted that lack of self-confidence is an un common failing in Western America generally. Chicago knows all about London and Paris. How can Paris and London be so ignorant, so indifferent about Chicago ? Now it appears to me there is one excellent reason why English folk generally do not know much about Chicago of to-day. That is, that it is a city of to-day, not of yesterday. What does a very partial witness 1 say on this head ? ' In 1860, it was one of the shabbiest and most unattractive cities of about a hundred thousand inhabitants anywhere to be found, but even then it had more than trebled its size in ten years, the streets were mud sloughs, the side walks were a series of stairs and more or less rotten planks : half the town was in process of elevation above the tadpole level, and a considerable part of it was on wheels—the moving house being about the only wheeled vehicle that could get around with any comfort to the passengers.' If this description was true thirty years ago, is there much blame to us if we, four thousand miles away, hold it as true now, failing to appreciate the changes which those thirty years have brought about, ignoring the marvellous advances which have been made in that short space of time ? The Western American, accustomed to see cities spring up from the plain like Jonah's gourd, must forgive us if we, whose environment is the slow result of secular development, can hardly believe in the reality of such rapid growth, such instantaneous progress as his. The present Chicago, that wonderful city, which has risen up in the twenty years since the great fire of 1871, has not had time to make itself known. London, or Manchester, or Leeds to-day is practically identical with London or Manchester or Leeds of twenty years ago. A description of the Chicago of five years back is now obsolete and inapplicable. The pleasant writer from whom I have quoted above declares that Chicago has reached a stage when she can afford to be modest. He thinks that her assured position as the metropolis of the West has abrogated the necessity for self-assertion. It must be admitted that his view is not shared by those of whom he writes. Indeed, that particular form of self-conceit which is content with a supreme confidence in one's own merits is an English rather than an American quality. John Bull has for so long been taught to consider himself as the salt of the earth, and so thoroughly believes the fact, that he is quite satisfied without expecting other people to admit it. Your American insists on his country's merits being ad mired. He is not content unless you will definitely express your belief in the superiority of American institutions, and if you hesitate to do so, there will be no hesitation in the manner in which he will 1 Charles Dudley Warner, in his1892 CHICAGO AND IT 555 state his own views on the subject. This is, no doubt, the effect partly of temperament, partly of the novelty of his surroundings. It is a youthful but perfectly honest condition of mind, and it is one that peoples as well as men grow out of with advancing years. 2 The only real objection to this intolerance of criticism is that it renders a foreigner wisely cautious about expressing his candid opinion. While he sees much to admire, he will naturally see much that he may not approve. He will do well to confine his criticism to the favourable side. And, after all, that Americans are sensitive to English criticism is but a proof of the genuine love and admiration which they most certainly have for the old country. It is, in very truth, the highest compliment they can pay us. And when there is so much to admire, what is the use of fault finding ? It is easy enough on all sides, but when it is done, nobody is pleased (except the critic) and nobody is the better (not even the critic). Let us look on the favourable side. There is plenty to s'ee there. During the next two years it is probable that Chicago will have a far greater number of visitors than in any similar period of her history—transient visitors, that is, for a large proportion of those who go to the city, go there to stay. Of all those millions there will be none, capable of being impressed, who will not be astonished at what they find. In all the world there is perhaps no site better suited for a prosperous city, no site less adapted for a beautiful one. The great lake, stretching far up into the north, compels all inter course by land between the vast districts on its east and on its west to pass round its southern end, where Chicago is situated. All the traffic over the great inland seas of America and from the Atlantic through them must pass by Chicago to reach the centre of the States and the river system of Southern North America. The establishment of such a trade centre has caused all the artificial channels along which trade flows to direct themselves upon it, and so it has come about that the railway system at all events of the Northern States has focussed itself upon Chicago. It is hardly possible to imagine any conditions, any altered state of things which can deprive the city of the advantageous position she has attained, or give to any rival even a share of her prosperity. And as the people of Chicago have done their best to utilise to the utmost the commercial advantages of their situation, so also have they endeavoured to minimise, as far as foresight and skill can minimise them, its natural disadvantages. Situated on the side of 2 I am by no means certain that it is a bit more objectionable than that insincere depreciation of ourselves and our institutions to which Englishmen are given. An American put this very ' straight' to a friend of mine by saying, ' We do brag, but anyhow we don't cant.'556 THE NINETEENTH CEN April a flat-shored lake, on the edge of an enormous plain, Chicago has not within some hundred miles of it any physical features of beauty or attraction. There is no 'country' round Chicago, nothing but an endless monotony of level plain. To atone for this, the designers of the city have determined to inclose within its boundaries as many areas of open ground as possible, and to give to those areas the greatest semblance of rural beauty that they can. They have encircled the city with a splendid ring of boulevards, expanding here and there into magnificent parks, so that no district of the city is without its own breathing-space, its own playground. To-day these boulevards are outside the city proper, or at least form its outer boundaries. To-morrow—in five or six years—they will be within its actual limits as they are already within its theoretical. For the nominal boundaries of the city are miles away out on the prairie. They were made, as Napoleon made streets in Paris, by ruling lines on a map with a big pencil, and even at its present rate of growth Chicago will take a generation or two before she fills out to them. For the comfort of the residents it may be hoped that this desired result may be long delayed. A city of the actual size of Chicago some eight or nine miles long by four or five wide, is big enough to satisfy all reasonable aspirations. If the citizens could only know the drawbacks of greatness, could realise the hideous inconveniences, for instance, arising from the size of London, they would not be in such a hurry to extend their boundaries. Fortunately, there is one direction in which Chicago cannot grow, and that is toward the lake. Think how much London would be improved were it set by the side of the sea, with sea-breezes coming up to clear away the smoke and fog—the soft coal burnt in Chicago produces a grimy smoke that would do credit to Manchester or Leeds —and to temper, occasionally, the blazing heat of July and August. On the northern side of the town, full advantage is taken of this one natural beauty of the town, for a stately road and promenade have been constructed along the beach. Along the lake side of the southern portion, unfortunately, a main railroad line has been allowed to take possession, so that this, the chief part of the town, has lost what might have been its greatest attraction. The business quarter of Chicago is [like a colossal Manchester. Prevented from expanding in one direction by the lake, hampered in its expansion in another by the river, it has been compelled to grow upward. The result has been some really fine buildings, imposing from their mere magnitude, some of the most monstrous and offensive constructions that the wit of man has yet devised. Still, they are all admirably suited for their purpose, which is to concentrate within the smallest possible area the largest possible amount of humanity. There must, I suppose, be more people gaining their living in the central square half-mile of Chicago, than in any other area of equal1892 CHICAGO AND I 557 size on the face of the earth. The thing is not a good thing to have done, but it has been done well, and nowhere, I am assured, and I believe it, can business be more readily and more conveniently trans acted than on this seething, swarming plot. Leaving the business quarter for the better residential parts of the town, we can pass for mile after mile along stately streets all as straight as ancient Eoman roads, having on either side fine houses, some mansions, some villas, for the most part detached, each standing in its own plot of ground, generally of greensward—there seem to be no gardens in Chicago, and few boundary walls or railings—some artistic, some inartistic, some pretentious, some even grotesque, but all comfortable and well-looking, betokening a high standard of wealth and a growing standard of appreciation of the beautiful. The suburbs of no English town, with their walled gardens and concealed houses, present anything of the special attraction of these long vistas of handsome buildings, individual but not separated, each distinct yet open to all the world. Turning away out of these fine streets, we soon get to unfinished districts of the city, where the roads are bad, and the houses have a temporary look. Even here and there on the main streets one may see an occasional wood-frame house, relic of the days before the fire. And, no doubt, Chicago has her squalid quarters, like every other great assemblage of mankind. These, however, the visitor is not taken to see, and I am only dealing with the hasty impressions of a passing visit. Of the life that is led within these comfortable abodes, nobody without long experience can well speak except from hearsay. One is left with the impression that if the people of Chicago treat one another with the boundless hospitality, the genial friendliness they extend to the wandering stranger, life there must have its advantages. To the outsider, however, it would seem that the absence of a leisure class, and therefore of any ambition to belong to it, must tend to deprive life of many of what we, on this side, esteem its most pleasant features. In Western America people do not seem to have any holiday time. They have few or no outdoor amusements, little sport, no hunting, no yachting, no games. Public opinion seems to expect everybody to be busy making money, and disapproves of the pursuits of those who are otherwise occupied. So nobody has any ambition, except to make money, and, when he has made it, to go on making more. Other objects of ambition are wanting. Politics offer no career. With us a seat in the House of Commons is an object to be attained. With them, a seat in the House of Kepre- sentatives is a means for attaining an object. Perhaps the latter is the more sensible view, but life is not the happier for the destruction even of imaginary ideals. Country life, as we know it, is unknown. Charming country houses there are, delightful houses for a short V ol . XXXI—N o . 182 Q Q558 THE NINETEENTH April visit, but the owners live in them as if they had taken them for a month—they have no local interests or ties. And yet, though wealth is the sole object of all men's desire, it does not appear that Chicago society is wholly dominated by wealth. A man who is a poor clerk in a dry-goods store to-day may be a millionaire to-morrow, and the existing millionaires seem to realise this fact, and, perhaps, to pride themselves on realising it. There are, under such circumstances, special reasons for acting on the wise precept of the Greek tragedian, to treat your friend as if some day he might be your enemy, and your enemy as if he might some day become your friend. Anyhow, there appears to be a good deal of real republican feeling in Chicago society, and a tendency to take men for what they are worth in other currency than that of the United States mint. There is strong evidence of a genuine desire to grow out of the vulgarity—if I may be pardoned so very uncivil an expression— which attached in the past to the reputation of Chicago and to the methods of money-making there. Such a desire is apt to bring about its own fruition • it has, to a large extent, done so, and the tendency will grow. The desire of many of the best men of Chicago is that their city, the city in which they take so just, so honest, a pride, should be renowned for its university, its libraries, its museums, its galleries, not for its stock-yards and grain-elevators, and in the not distant future they and their sons are likely to see their hopes realised. Having so much that is worth showing to show, is it any matter for surprise that the people of Chicago seized on the suggestion that the quarter-centenary of Columbus's discovery of America should be celebrated by an international exhibition, and set to work with characteristic energy to secure for their city this magnificent adver tisement ? Many of them, indeed, thought that they were not quite ready, that they wanted a few more years to finish their streets, to complete their parks, to build yet a larger number of big buildings. It was, however, evident that the opportunity would not recur. The splendour of the Paris Exhibition of 1889 had inflamed the minds of the Americans who saw it, and had roused the feeling of rivalry so natural to the American breast. France had had the best and biggest exhibition. America must have a better, and, above all, a bigger one. That was settled by common consent. The question was, where? New York was naturally first suggested. To us on this side it seems as natural that any national undertaking should in America find its place at New York as that in England it should come to London, or that in France Paris should give it room. This is not so in the United States. Those States, though united, are yet separate and individual. They have their antagonisms as the various countries of Europe have. Between the East and West there seems1892 CHICAGO AND I to be growing up a rivalry as strong in its way, though of a very different character, as the old feeling between North and South. The strong young communities of the West will have themselves acknowledged, are no longer content to be regarded as quasi-colonial appendages of the empire of the East. When the great national function was decided upon, the West put in her claim, and her representative was of necessity the ad mitted metropolis of the West, Chicago. So the struggle narrowed down to a fight between the two great cities. The western city en forced her arguments by promptly undertaking to find ten millions of dollars—say 2,000,000L sterling—and this powerful argument settled the matter. New York was at first incredulous, then exaspe rated. She does not love her pushing, energetic sister. Probably the feeling is mainly one of sentiment. The two cities must be too far apart for any injurious trade competition. There is work for both of them. The prosperity of Chicago has in no sense grown at the expense of New York. On the contrary, Chicago has, to a large extent, been built up with New York capital, and the interests of the two cities are in many respects identical. But the pride of the older city was touched. When an individual has enjoyed admitted pre eminence in any line of life, he does not like the notion of a younger man coming in to share his honours with him, and the same rule holds good of communities. New York is the capital of the United States. The idea of a second capital arising for the western division of her empire cannot be pleasing to her. Mr. Warner—to refer once more to his interesting volume—shows this in his own person. He is taken quite aback by the fact of anybody seriously, and without any sense of incongruity, comparing Chicago and New York, but after a little thought he admits that after all it is not so unreasonable for an outsider unconsciously to place the two cities in the same class, and to apply the same standard to both. This is somewhat of a concession, and when it is made by Mr. Warner's neighbours as well as by Mr. Warner, a good deal of the feeling of rivalry will be dead. That it still exists is certain, even that it has been temporarily embittered by the success of Chicago in getting chosen as the site of the ' World's Fair.' The Chicagoans, having obtained the concession, set about to make the most of it. They promptly subscribed the necessary guarantee fund, which—according to the terms of the Act of Congress —justified the President in appointing a commission, and in inviting the co-operation of foreign nations. It might be thought that it would have been more consonant with the general tendency of Ameri can politics to make the exhibition a national one only. It seems hardly reasonable that a country should one day establish a tariff in tended to keep out foreign trade, and the next organise an exhibi tion of which one main purpose would be to encourage foreign Q Q 2560 THE NINETEENTH April traders. Fortunately, however, Iniman affairs are seldom governed by principles of pure logic, and the same Congress which, passed the McKinley Tariff Act, also provided a most admirable opportunity for those who are injured by the tariff, at home and abroad, to demon strate to the American people, if they can, how serious are the losses it will inflict upon them. For whatever reasons, then, it was determined that the display should be international. Nothing less would serve the ambition of its promoters, and indeed nothing less would quite have answered their purpose. Formal invitations were consequently addressed by the President to all the countries of the world. Kesponses at first came in slowly. Lord Salisbury, on behalf of Great Britain, at once promised a Royal Commission. France accepted cordially. Some other countries undertook to co-operate, but no very definite steps were taken anywhere to carry these resolutions into effect. Under these circumstances, the National Commission appointed a sub-com mission to visit Europe, and ascertain definitely the intentions of the various Governments. These gentlemen arrived in England last summer, and the very cordial welcome they received no doubt greatly facilitated their work on the Continent, since the intimate relations between England and America of necessity led the other European nations to wait and see, before deciding on their own course, what the action of England would be. The ultimate result of their mission was to hasten the appoint ment of the Royal Commission 3 in this country ; to cause the ap pointment of commissioners in Germany and Denmark, and to obtain promises of support from certain other countries. The practical outcome of the commissioners' journey was to make it certain that the exhibition would have a genuinely international character, and this again reacted upon the feelings with which the project was regarded in America, and lent it an added importance. While it is the chief object of the country holding an international exhibition to demonstrate its superiority over other countries—this was carried out with much skill and conspicuous success in 1889 at p ar i s —it is also necessary that, for the sake of comparison, the pro ducts of other countries should be shown. An opportunity is thus afforded to her trade rivals, and an opportunity which, as a rule, they find it essential not to neglect. It is true that for the European countries there are special diffi culties on the present occasion. Chicago is a long way off, four 3 The Council of the Society of Arts was appointed to serve as the Koyal Com mission, with a grant of 25,000Z. towards the expenses, it being left to the Com mission to raise any further amount required by charges to the exhibitors. The following grants were made on previous occasions: Paris, 1867, 126,000Z.; Vienna, 1873, 29,000Z.; Philadelphia, 1876, 40,000?.; Paris, 1878, 87,000?. For Paris, 1889, no grant was made ; a sum of 30,0001. was raised by charges to the exhibitors.1892 CHICAGO AND IT 561 thousand miles away. It is even a long way from the sea-coast where all the goods have to be landed. Nor does it rank quite with with Paris as a pleasure resort. We are all of us too glad of an excuse to go to Paris, and we crowd to an exhibition there from every corner of the earth. The delights of Chicago are not yet sufficiently familiar to attract us thither. On the other hand, Chicago is in the midst of a perfectly new country, a country full of rich men, and fuller still of well-to-do men, where people are just awakening to the delights of luxury and the joys of luxurious living, where art is beginning to be fashionable, and the market for artistic wares great and growing. Now and in the years to come all that ministers to the delight of the eye and the pride of life will find a ready sale in Western America, as new towns are built, all of new houses requiring new furniture, new decorations, new fittings of every degree of comfort and luxury. As the Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876 set the fashion of house building and furniture throughout the Northern States, so it is pretty certain will the Chicago one of 1893 set the fashion in the West. The great difficulty, however, in the way of British exhibitors is neither the distance of Chicago nor the consequent cost of exhibiting there. It is, of course, the McKinley Tariff. Why, I have been asked over and over again, why should I show my goods to a people who are acting in so unfriendly a manner, who are doing the best they can to prevent my selling those goods ? The answer to this cannot be given offhand, and it must depend on the character of the particular manufacturer. As a general consideration, it is to be remembered that an exhibition is visited by people from all parts of the world, and that the things shown there are not shown only to the natives of the country where the exhibition is held. For instance, the Chicago people expect to have large numbers of visitors from South America, and they regard the exhibition as offering a most favourable opportunity of getting our South American trade away from us. If they are correct, it is essential that our manufacturers who make for the South American market should be prepared to keep themselves in the minds of those of their customers from that continent who visit the exhibition. As to the unfriendliness of the tariff, surely that is a very feeble and somewhat hypocritical sort of argument. We are a free-trade country, not because of our great love for all other countries, but because the majority of us consider it to be a good thing for ourselves. America is protectionist for no better and no worse a cause. Can anybody believe that if a majority of British voters were of the same mind as the majority of American voters apparently are on this point, one or other of our political parties would not at once become pro tectionist, and would give us a McKinley Tariff of our own as soon as the necessary parliamentary fighting had been done ?562 THE NINETEENTH April It appears to me that if the American people have come to the conclusion that the best way to develop their own industries is to put a high protective duty on the products of others, they are perfectly justified in imposing such a duty. They are merely acting according to their own best lights. It is our business to show them, if we can, that they are wrong, that they are encouraging the manu facture of inferior goods and increasing their price,; that they are not keeping out our wares, but only making the American consumer pay more for them. To grumble at and abuse the Americans is mere foolishness. To refuse to take every chance of improving our trade is to perform the childish operation of cutting off our nose to spite our face. And it is by no means certain that the new tariff will have the effect expected of it. As was pointed out by Mr. Carnegie in a previous number of this Review, 4 it remains to be seen whether it will have very much effect on British trade with the United States. Large classes of our goods are not touched by it; the duties on some others are reduced. Very many can stand the increased rate, which is paid by the American consumer in higher prices, while for others, again, no duty is protective, since they cannot be made in America at all. It is said that the chief result of the very heavy duties on tin-plate has been to lower the profit of American fruit growers. A can of preserved fruit has to be sold for a certain price. The can costs more, so its contents must cost less. There has, of course, been a falling off in British export trade during the past twelve or eighteen months. Careful examination of the figures, however, shows that the falling off in the trade with the United States is only a little greater in proportion than the diminution in other quarters. Nor would it be fair to put even all of this down to the account of the tariff. Some of it is certainly to be attributed to other causes than increased customs dues. The mere overstocking of the market from heavy purchases under the old rates would alone have caused a diminished export if the tariff had been suddenly abolished the day after it came into force. Changes of fashion also will account for at all events some of the diminution. The Bradford manufacturers are very sore about the tariff, and probably they have suffered from it as much as anybody. But they are certainly also suffering from one of those capricious changes of fashion to which their trade is so specially liable. To take one example: it is stated on good authority that one principal article of export to the United States was the sort of plush known as imitation sealskin. This has gone out of fashion, and the manu facturers of this material, both here and in America, will be out of work till they find some other class of goods for which there is a rapid and extensive demand. That the existing depression in their 4 Nineteenth Centur June 1891.1892 CHICAGO AND I 563 trade is not caused by the tariff alone is shown by tlie failure of one of our largest manufacturers to set up and work successfully a branch factory in America, and the decision arrived at by another firm of like standing that it would not pay—even with the aid of the tariff—to attempt to manufacture in America the goods which they declare are excluded solely by high customs dues. Again, the tariff may or may not be permanent. It may quite possibly be succeeded by a scale of duties lower than the one which it replaced, and on which it was, after all, only a comparatively small advance. Customs duties have ruled high in America for a long time past. At the last congressional elections the country declared against it, and though public feeling in the States seems since to have veered round towards the protectionist quarter, it is by no means certain that it will keep there. At any rate, the majority in favour of protection is, if it really exists at all, a very small one, and at any moment the system may be changed. Whether this will be to our advantage remains to be seen; those who are entitled to express their opinion on the question do not hesitate to state their belief that the day when America becomes a free-trade country will be a disastrous one for British commerce. Finally, if the tariff is so potent an instrument for keeping out British goods, it is the interest of British manufacturers to fight it in every way, to destroy it if possible, to render it nugatory if it cannot be destroyed. The United States is far and away our largest customer. Are we to lie down supine before the barrier she has erected to protect her own industries, wringing our hands in distress because it is difficult to pass ? This was not the way in which our commerce was created, nor in such fashion will it be maintained. Eather should we use every legitimate means to get over it, or through it, or round it. We must show the Americans that, in spite of all the artificial obstacles they can place in the road, we can still make our way into their markets. We must prove that in certain classes of manufacture we can still beat them. We must seize every opportunity of showing them—where we can—how much better our wares are than theirs, and so long as we can do this, we need not fear hostile tariffs. When we fail to do so, we may admit ourselves beaten, get rid of seven-eighths of our population, and set the rest to grow cheese and butter for their own consumption. There is one thing certain, that we shall have—as in all trade matters—a much stronger competition to face from other nations than at any previous exhibition. Our manufacturers have profited largely in the past by these great international shows, they have gained advantage for themselves and credit for their country. A general tendency is now showing itself in matters commercial to rest content with things as they are, and this is evident in case of exhibitions as elsewhere. Foreign nations are profiting by the564 THE NINETEENTH April lessons we have taught them, and are bettering our example. At Paris in 1889, Belgium, for instance, had an exhibit of the highest class, and many of the firms who took part in it are believed to have gained thereby considerable increase in their business. Germany, of course, held aloof in 1889, but her manufacturers are all the keener to take advantage of the opportunity of 1893. They, too, have an eye on the South American trade, and believe they see their way to picking up customers at Chicago. The grant made by the German Government is just double that given by ours, and the German exhibitors are by so much in a more favourable position than ours. Instead of having to contribute to the cost of general administration, they will no doubt be liberally assisted both directly and indirectly. The funds are at the disposal of a most capable and energetic administrator, Herr Adolphe Wermuth, who gained deserved credit by the success he made of the German Section at the last Melbourne Exhibition. The action likely to be taken by France seems as yet uncertain. If reports are to be trusted, the prospect of an important contribution from thence seem less favourable now than they did a while ago; but with the amount proposed, 120,000^., the French Section ought to be magnificent. Mexico is believed to have made the largest subvention of any, 150,000?. ; Brazil next, with 120,000?.; then Japan, which promises 100,000?. According to the latest statements, foreign Governments have already promised an aggregate sum of over three-quarters of a million sterling for their commissions at Chicago, and information cannot be available yet from very many of the countries likely to take a part. And the competition (if in this connection it is right to use the woid) will come, not only from other countries, but from our own colonies. The colonies have already voted sums equal in the aggre gate to some 100,000?., and during the next three or four months we shall certainly hear of these amounts being largely increased. Canada and New South W ales are arranging to send large contributions, so is the Cape. Victoria has lately announced her intention of taking pait in the exhibition, and in considering with the other Australian colonies the question of a joint Australian exhibit. Tasmania pro poses to fill a considerable space. The West Indian colonies have had the matter in hand for a long while, and many of the small colonies also intend to be represented. The Indian Government at present is, most unfortunately, disinclined to participate, and no doubt the trade in Indian tea and textiles will suffer in consequence. India has, however, been called upon for very many contributions to pre vious exhibitions, and though Indian commerce has profited, the price paid was unduly high. The energetic people of Ceylon are taking a different view, and are making preparations already to push their tea strenuously into American markets. But severe as the friendly rivalry will be, there seems no reason1892 CHICAGO AND IT 565 to fear that the country will fail to keep the leading position it has always held since the first Exhibition was held in Hyde Park in 1851. It is to be remembered that we have a character to maintain. The British Section has always been the best at foreign exhibitions. It, has, I think, always filled the largest space, taken the largest pro portion of jury awards, and generally proved the most important. Even in 1889, without a Government grant, or the hardly less im portant aid of Grovernment influence, we held our own. If it were found that England was ready to take a lower place at a ' World's Fair,' our enemies would have some reason to say that our old spirit of commercial enterprise was less vigorous than of yore. If it is to the advantage of other countries to spend lavishly for the purpose—to a large extent—of taking our trade away from us, it is worth our while to bestir ourselves for the purpose of keeping it. That, under protest, and after a due amount of grumbling, we shall do so, as we did at Paris in 1889, I thoroughly believe, for I think that there is every reason to expect that alike in art and in in dustry the British Section at Chicago will be worthy of comparison with the British Section at former exhibitions, and will have similar important results on the prosperity both of our art and of our manufacturing industries. Our manufacturers generally seem quite alive to the importance of the occasion, and preparations are now being made in various parts of the country for a display of certain classes of British goods which promises to eclipse even the fine collections shown before on similar occasions. Should it prove otherwise, it would be disastrous, not only because such a falling off would justly be held a symptom of the decadence of our commercial powers, but because it would imply some lack of friendly feeling between ourselves and our great kindred beyond the seas were England to take any but the foremost place on so special an occasion as the great national festival which America is making ready to hold at Chicago in 1893. Henry Trueman Wood {Secretary to the Royal Commission for the Chicago Exhibition, 1893— British Section).566 THE NINET April LORD LYTTON'S RANK O n the 24th of November, 1891, Lord Lytton, diplomatist, Indian administrator, and poet, after a six weeks' illness of great physical pain heroically borne, died at Paris, where he was ambassador. To the last, and in spite of bodily infirmities, he retained his fall clear ness and activity of mind, and was able not only to transact official business, but also to busy himself with that higher intellectual work which had been the true motive of his life. His very latest care was given to the correction of the verses which are the text of this paper. He called them Mar ah, 1 for the waters of bitterness were at his lips; and the morning of the day he died was spent in setting down on paper its concluding lines, which he had thought out in the night. It was a fitting ending to a life brimming over with the romance of politics, of social success,; and of literature. As his very intimate friend, of twenty-six years standing, I may perhaps be allowed to say a word or two at the outset about this life on its personal side, for it is that I knew best; and when all is said and done, it is the personality of those who have played a great part in the world that interests us most. I saw it in its most striking phases, and what I did not see, I learned in our long intercourse from his lips. He had an unhappy childhood, a Bohemian home where bitter quarrels were rife, and poverty, or something very like it, stood often at the door. Of his two parents, whom he equally tried to love, the great novelist, his father, with all his brilliancy of wit and literary sensibility, was a mere egotist in domestic life, and from first to last fulfilled almost no duty of a parent towards him; while his Irish mother was what the world has seen her, and what she has herself published to the world. Lord Lytton's tenderness towards his father was a touching trait of his affectionate character, and in all his many talks I do not remember to have heard a single word of bitterness escape his lips about him. It is pleasant to think that this filial piety was rewarded late in the unbounded love of his own children, for nothing really is lost to those who give freely, and their bread cast on the waters returns to them always, though it may be after many days. His one absorbing affection, however, in childhood was for his sister, a year older than himself, whom he had the misery of losing when 1 Published by Longmans &amp; Co.—rr-r - ..I* lgi|HI &gt; 1 1 1892 LORDLYT TON'S RANK 567 lie was still a boy, and under circnmstances whicli made her death most bitter to him. I do not think he ever quite forgot this early- grief, and traces of it may be found, if I mistake not, throughout his writings. He was launched early on the world. At seventeen, his uncle. Sir Henry Bulwer, afterwards Lord Palling, obtained him his first nomina tion in diplomacy, and he was sent abroad to shift as he could for himself on a very insufficient allowance, which for a while even ceased entirely. Lord Lytton has told me that at the time he was writing Lucile he was without monfey-resources of any kind, and I know that at another earlier period he Was within a little of committing suicide, as an escape from miseries greater than he could bear. 'What saved him through all was his poetry. His first volume, Clytemnestra, published when he was twenty-four under the name of ' Owen Meredith,' was a very clear success—as much so as Mr. Swin burne's and the public praise it won gave him his first feeling of self-confidence, and so the courage needed by his timid and sensitive nature to fight out his life's battle. It was followed closely by Wanderer, written for the greater part at Florence, and under the double influence of a first passionate love and the intellectual com panionship of the Brownings, with whom he long enjoyed the most intimate and affectionate: relations. was at once recognised at its worth, and, established his poetical fame above that of any of his young contemporaries, and to the extent that for the first time his father, who had hitherto underrated his son's abilities, became aware of them, and 'was even, as I have heard, jealously annoyed at his popularity) , It was indeed a wonderful volume, the most wonderful perhaps in lyric poetry of any published in the present half-century, and I am constantly astonished that it should not be more widely acknowledged: as such by the present generation of critics. Its only rivals seem-to me to be Swinburne's first volume of Songs and Ballads, and Eossetti's volume containing of Life. But: of this later., i i Lncile, published in 1861, completed ' Owen Meredith's' popularity,'! and literature opened wide to him her ; fairest fields for his assured ambition. It was about this time that I first remember to have^een him, a young man of twenty-nine, with a beautiful dreamy;face and curly hair.

There was some thing typica^ in the audi thej act. He and Fane had just published' their joint metriciil version of and his volume of Servian Songs was in the press,.568 THE NINETEENTH April Our real acquaintance, however, and friendship were not to begin till five years later. In the interval he had married, most happily as the world knows, and indeed his marriage proved to him the one great unchanging blessing of his life. He had now an assured posi tion, for his father had been obliged to make him a proper settlement, and he had risen to the rank of Secretary, or, as we should now say, First Secretary of Legation, and was temporarily in charge of the Mission at Lisbon. It was perhaps the happiest time of his life— certainly that of his greatest poetical activity, and politics had not yet begun to engross him. I will try and recall the exact circum stances of this our second and more eventful meeting. It was in the month of August 1865. I had been sent to Lisbon in a kind of disgrace from Paris, having been banished by the paternal care of Lord Hammond, then omnipotent at the Foreign Office, from that city of delights, where I had lived not wisely but too well, to what I considered a terrible and undeserved exile at Lisbon. I was miserably unhappy about this and about other circumstances of my life, which need not here be explained, and stood, in fact, just at that parting of the ways in youth where a little sympathy, more or less, of a certain kind means a whole world of difference in its choice of a road—on this side to salvation, on that to perdition. Lisbon is the mournfullest, as well as the most beautiful of grass-grown cities, and on landing there in the burning heat of summer, my spirits had sunk to their lowest point of depression. I found the Legation deserted, the minister in England on leave, and no one to receive me at my new post but the Chancery servant. I was the only and my only colleague, Mr. Lytton, was living in Villegiatura, he told me, away in the hills at Cintra. I took a ramshackle hack carriage and set out to find him; and, as we toiled up the dusty road in the after noon sun to where Cintra lies perched beneath the eagle's nest of the Pena, my misery seemed to have reached its full. Weary and dis pirited I fell asleep in the carriage. I shall never forget the sensation of waking in the cool mist at the top of the pass, or the sweet fresh smell of the cork woods dripping with rain as we stopped at the door of the little country inn (kept by an ancient Welsh landlady, once bumboat woman to the fleet) in which Lytton had established himself in solitude for the summer. He ran out to meet me as soon as I was announced, and with that prodigality of affectionate kindness which was so great a charm in him, welcomed me in. I had hardly been half an hour with him before I felt that, like the pilgrim to the Delectable Mountains, the burden of my sins was falling from my back, and that I had found a guide and friend to show me a way out of my misfortunes. And so in truth it proved. All that evening, and till late into the night, we sat talking of things divine, poetry, philosophy, and sentiment, and many an evening afterwards, till the hours grew small and the candles burned low in their sockets, and a1892 LORD LYTTON'S RANK 569 new world of hope was opened to me by his sympathy, and wisdom, and encouragement. If I have had anything in me since of in tellectual ambition, the desire to achieve something in literature, and not wholly to waste my life on idle griefs and pleasures, it is to him I owe it, and I am glad to record my debt to him here. We spent three months together almost alone in those Portuguese hills, for his wife was away in England and there was no society, and every day my admiration for him and love grew greater. On diplomatic business I do not remember that we wasted a single word or a single thought, for there were no questions pending, but we spent our mornings writing poetry, and our afternoons wandering on donkey-back through the cork woods, and our evenings in readings and recitations. He was a wonderful reciter, almost an improvisatore, and would seize upon any story he had heard or read, and show in admirable words and with fragments of half-impromptu verse how it could be turned into a poem. In these moods he was as one inspired, and having listened to him one went away impressed with the idea that one had heard something greater and more beautiful and more dramatic than any written drama. Thus, too, it sometimes happened that, reading the same poem afterwards in its final form, one was a little disappointed. The extreme brilliancy was gone with his words, and the effect, though still beautiful, had become paler and less vivid. The truth is, that while his imagination was wonderfully quick and facile, as is the case, I believe, with all poets of a high order, he lacked somewhat of that rigid self-denial and labour in the choice of words and phrases which produces the absolutely best finished work. He allowed himself, how often, to be led aside, as it were, by butterflies from his path, following a rhyme here and a fancy there to the less perfect rendering of the main idea. In recital these digressions seemed in their place, being lightly passed over, while the main points had all their due prominence. The suddennesses of changes were only a new charm which carried the listener on. In reading, however, one was more critical, and the poems became poems only. It was in this way that I had the good fortune to assist at the birth of a number of those admirable half-dramatic pieces which were published later under the name of Chronicles — Licinius, The Botanist's Grave, and How wonderful, too, were his readings from Browning and Victor Hugo, his two favourite poets then! I had never read a line of Browning till I knew Lord Lytton, and his interpretation of the subtleties of that master of riddles has remained to me like a flash of lightning seen on a dark night, making the subsequent darkness only the more perplexing. The Gram Caliban, and Paracelsus, were, I think, the pieces he liked best, and, of Victor Hugo, Le Crajpaud and L His admira tion for Browning was at that time almost unbounded, though he570 THE NINETEENTH April considered Victor Hugo, and justly, the greater poet of the two. To Tennyson I do not think that he was in those days quite just, for it was the dramatic quality that attracted him most, even in lyric writ ing, and the monotonous blank verse of the irritated him, and the emasculated paraphrasing of Mallory's grand old prose. Our afternoon rides were a special delight, for there are few more lovely hills in the world than those of Cintra, and they are enshiined for me for ever in the verses he published about them many years afterwards in his volume called Aft I consider them his best descriptive lines, for as a rule description was not the strongest point in his verse. He lacked, I used to think, something of the correctness of the artist's eye, and it was always the human interest rather than Nature's which stood prominently in his fore grounds. The physical world lent him similes and illustrations of human passion, rather than the subject itself. In this he resembled Byron much more nearly than our more modern poets, and it is dis tinctly to the Byronic school that his place belongs. I rejoice to think that these delightful days, which were to me the first I had ever enjoyed with an intellect of the highest order—a kind of intel lectual honeymoon—were but the prelude of a true and constant friendship maintained unbroken between us till he died. Neither absence, nor growing age, nor diverging political opinions, were ever able to change it from the romance it was when it first began. Of his later life what shall I say ? Though such sole companion ship as that of our three months together at old Mrs. Lawrence's inn was never renewed, I had the good fortune to be with him at most of the important epochs of his eventful career: at the time of his father's death; when he made his first acquaintance with the literary world of Paris as Secretary under Lord Lyons ; when political ambition was first set before him with the offer of the Governorship of Madras ; at Simla, after his first successful war, when he was signing the treaty of G-andamak and despatching the mission to Cabul; on his return from India a year later, when he was preparing his ! defence for the House of Lords ; and at Knebworth, when he was writing ; lastly, in the scene of his final diplomatic triumphs at Paris ; alas ! too, on his deathbed in the green drawing-room of the Embassy there, when, with stoical courage, he lay face to face with his approaching end. No man, a poet born, has ever had so wonderful a career, and no public man has ever maintained his individuality so free, so absolutely unaffected by official circumstance. Honours and dignities were unable to turn his head, or official routine to dull his sensibilities. He was always, and under all circumstances, essentially the man of imagination, of feeling, of wit, the hunter of the ideal, the dreamer of romantic dreams, the lyric poet he was born. As such he will live in his written works long after his work as a statesman and diplomatist shall have been forgotten ; and as such it was his persistent ambition1892 LORD LYTTON'S RANK 571 to live. I think he cared nothing for his fame in public life, though he was conscious of having done his duty to his country on divers trying occasions, according to his rather old-fashioned, ideas of patriotism. But the fate of his books was a vivid and enduring interest, and perhaps the chief sorrow of his life was the comparative failure of Glenaveril to take the public fancy. Glenaveril was his greatest—indeed, a gigantic effort, being a rhymed novel of some 50,000 lines in eight-lined stanzas, the fruit of his maturest intellect, and written in the delightful atmosphere of his happiest home life at Knebworth. On it he had built his hope of taking a first rank among English poets, and had it been the full success he hoped for it, the tone of despondency so visible in his later writings would not in all probability have gained its ascendency over him. There had been nothing morbid up to this point in his muse, and Glenaveril itself was pre-eminently healthy. Unfortunately, the poem had peculiarities of form and circumstance which damned it with the general public. It was inordinately long, and was made to appear longer by the unfortunate experiment of bringing it out in monthly parts. The plot was a very intricate one, far too intricate in my opinion for a poem, and the public could not carry its attention from one number to another, so that the later volumes, which were the best, were hardly read at all. The poem, too, contained political digressions which, good though they were as such, were unnecessary for the story's development, and raised against its author the bitterness of party feeling, and party feeling is unsparing and unjust. Thus it failed of the expected appreciation, and not even his nomination to Paris, gratifying though it was to him in other ways, could quite console him for the literary disappointment. To this I attribute the sadness of all his later poems and a grow ing weariness of life, which was very evident to his intimate friends. In politics an ultra-Conservative, and so almost of necessity a pessimist, he found it difficult to find comfort in the affairs of the great world he was called to administer. His official ambition had been satisfied and cloyed with the Viceroyalty of India, where he had spent his best energies, and his work at Paris, congenial as it was in many ways, and performed with marked success, never quite absorbed him. During the last four years of his life he withdrew more and more into a world of shadows, where he sought the phantom of his lost youth and grasped only the realities of age. All men of imagination go through some such experience, but few have had the courage to record it, or to leave behind them in any tangible form the history of its bitterness. Marah is the record of Lord Lytton's last decep tion in the world of sentiment, and it stands as such almost unique in English literature. Indeed, I know of nothing which can exactly be compared with it, for our passionate poets have seldom been long-572 THE NINETEENTH April lived, and Goethe's romance of old age lias remained without an English imitator. On this account will be found of supreme interest as well as inexpressibly touching by all who knew Lord Lytton either personally or as the young love-poet he was to readers in his days of ' Owen Meredith.' What a world of astonishing ex periences has filled the interval between the publication of the two volumes, Mar ah and The Wanderer ; what grandeurs of ambition, what sublimities of power enjoyed, what dealings with princes and potentates, what honours reaped, what public obloquy endured— the Durbar at Delhi, the Afghan War, Cavagnari's death, his great success at Paris, all in the eye of the universe, and to end in the same hankering after an ideal happiness which could not be attained, the same grief at life's little meed of pleasure, the same tears, only how much bitterer! 1 Eoll waves! To rest refused I too aspire. Weep clouds ! I too slied tears that fall in yain. Lightnings, illuminate ye my drear desire ! Thunder, be thou the echo of my pain ! 2 Black shrouded midnight, shuddering with cold sighs, And fearful with faint creepings, gather all Thy ghosts and spectres ! Bid them each, devise New horrors to adorn thy sable hall! 3 For the drear drama the drear stage prepare, Deck it with deluge, garland it with storm, Assemble all the Powers of Darkness there, And what I suffer let them then perform ! 4 Not long will they their fleeting parts sustain In the fixt misery I endure alone. To-morrow's sun will scatter to-night's rain ; When comes the dawn the darkness will be gone. 5 To-morrow will the storm have spent its force ; But mine will be to-morrow, and to-morrow The same unutterable discontent. Stung by the same intolerable sorrow! These are among the latest of the lines he wrote, and all the best in Marah are in the same despairing key. They might have been written by a very young man at odds with life before he had known it—for in age we learn to conceal our griefs—yet Lord Lytton was nearly sixty years old. How pathetic, too, is this other!1892 LORDLYTTON'S RANK 573 R ubies anb P earls 1 All I had to give, I gave her. First my kisses, then my tears. But the little one would have them not. ' What use are they ? ' she said. Sad I went away, and dwelt among the tombs where days are years. With the witch that gathers herbs there, and her children who are dead. 2 They and I became companions ; and their dusty shrouds were wet With my flowing tears, and warm beneath my kiss their white lips burned, Till the witch, whose grave-yard gatherings rare miracles beget. Wrought my kisses into rubies, and my tears to pearls she turned. 3 But she drained into each ruby's heart from mine a drop of blood, And a purity my spirit lost with every pearl that fell. Then she laughed, ' Good pearls thy tears are now, thy kisses rubies good, And the proper use of precious stones thy little one knows well.' 4 So I took my pearls and rubies to the little one I love, She that loves me not. And, when her pretty eyes beheld them, wild Beat her little heart with eagerness its pride in them to prove. And she kissed and kissed me, weeping tears of pleasure like a child. 6 Still she wears them, still she shows them to her lovers with delight, And her little heart would break, I think, if one of them were lost; For the sweetest of its pleasures is the envy they excite, And 'tis spoilt by no suspicion of the price that they have cost. Heine miglit have written this, but surely no other poet of our time or country. Of Lord Lytton's place permanently in literature I desire to say a word before closing this notice of his latest work. I would ask myself, What is his true poetic rank ? How will he stand in history among the singers of his generation, the poets of the Victorian age ? Will his name be quoted as representative of these and of English letters ? Will his work live ? Does it deserve to live ? In answering these questions, I would say at the outset that, while generally sceptical about the future of modern taste in most arts, I have with regard to the art poetic a very fair confidence that the critical faculty of the intelligent few (and these alone in our time read poetry) is being developed in the right direction, and that its judgments are sound. It happens of course, now and then, that mis takes are made. Critics in the press are hardly ever quite candid or quite unbiassed about their living contemporaries. Writers of an inferior order are sometimes puffed for a while if they are personally liked, and there is a not unnatural reverence for great living names which carries even their worst work through the press in a chorus of V ol . XXXI—N O . 182 EE574 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY April applause. But the ' claque' is quickly recognised, and the readers of poetry are not persuaded to persevere long with the admiration forced upon them. Again, really good writers do not always gain their full meed or appreciation at once, or during the period of their best production. Look at Browning, who had written all that was really of the first order while he was an almost unknown man Irving abroad, and who became famous in London when he had ceased to compose anything but intellectual puzzles thrown at the heads of his admirers. Look at Keats and Shelley. I am old enough to remember the time when it required some courage to admire either of them without grave reserves. The few great classics then stood on an unassailed pedestal; and a man would have been considered absolutely mad who should have preferred to or the Ode to a Grecian Urn to the We have more courage now, and, as I think, a better canon of criticism, and are more just. If anyone doubts this, let him look through any library, public or private, and try if he can discover a readable volume of verse by an unknown author of more than fifty years ago. None such, I venture to say, exists, and we may rest assured that all supreme merit will continue to be recognised, all true poetry to find its proper level. With Lord Lytton's poetry I am, therefore, in no pain as to its ultimately ranking according to its worth. For the moment, how ever, it seems to me that the political part played by the man has vitiated somewhat the public judgment in its estimate of the writer. Politics and poetry are in the English mind antagonistic things, and it is considered that high merit in the one implies a correspond ing lack of merit in the other. In our system, too, of party war fare every organ of criticism, even those most exclusively devoted to art, is obliged to have its side declared or half-declared in politics, and so we see poets extolled or belittled in large measure according to their supposed political opinions. Mr. Swinburne has been a favourite of the Times since he became known as the enemy of Irish priestcraft. Mr. William Morris, the Socialist, finds his best applause in the Pall Mall Gazette-, Mr. Lewis Morris, the Gladstonian candidate, in the DailyNeivs. This is only natural, and it would be folly to complain of it, but still it needs to be considered if we are to estimate things fairly. In Lord Lytton's case, I think, he has suffered doubly as a poet from his political attitude. He has incurred the resentment of the Liberal Press for being too strong a Tory, and at the same time his high public position has caused his political friends to treat his poetry as no more than that holiday flirtation with the Muse which statesmen are allowed. By neither side has he been treated according to his full literary deserts. Now, however,1892 LORDLYT TON'S RANK tliat the grave lias closed over all contentious matters in his public career, I anticipate a wiser and less partial judgment of his poetic work. Each year as it goes by will withdraw him politically further from our gaze and bring him as a poet nearer to us. Then we may expect to see him take the high rank he deserves. My estimate of what this rank will be is that, as a lyric poet, the position given him will be next, among his contemporaries after Tennyson, Swinburne, and Eossetti. He has neither Tennyson's full perfection of lyric style nor Swinburne's wealth of musical rhetoric. Eossetti I personally should place before any of them as master of the purest English perhaps in our literature, but it is doubtful whether, his masterpieces being nearly all in sonnet form, the consensus of criticism will give him so high a place. Apart from these three I see no contemporary who is likely to be placed as Lytton's equal. Not Browning, with his tortuous method of thought and disjointed diction; not Mathew Arnold, with his intellectual melodies always a little flat in the rendering; hardly even William Morris, great singer though he be, in the purely lyrical field. Lytton's lyrical style is brilliant, direct, personal, and essentially modem. It treats of nine teenth-century things in a nineteenth-century way, and this, I ven ture to think, will be held in the twentieth century a permanent and pre-eminent merit. Archaisms and reproductions of other ages and modes of thought please the generation for which they are written more than those which come after, and what we ask most of the poetry of the past is that it should be true to the genius of its own time and its own people. This quality cannot fail to be valued in Lord Lytton's verse when the Victorian age is finally reviewed. Dramatically, and in our English dearth of dramatic power. Lord Lytton, too, ranks high. Compared with contemporary French poets, with Hugo, or Musset, or Coppee, I should not, of course, claim for In'm a place in the first line ; Browning alone of our metrical play-writers could pretend to this ; but Orval is a noble dramatic poem, as, in its classic way, is Glytemnestra, while the dramatic element in and Characters and in The Wanderer is more strongly marked than in any modern English writer. Browning and perhaps Henry Taylor only excepted. As a novellist in verse, Lytton stands absolutely alone. Lucile is the most brilliant piece of light narrative since and Glenaveril the most splendid failure. Nor in his philosophy, the philosophy of the man of the world, is Lytton to be approached by the writers of our day. His Fables in in two volumes, are a mine of latter-day wisdom, as will be, when it is published, his Poppy, a political satire which he considered his masterpiece, and left behind him finished, the concentrated result of his experience of mankind. E R 2576 THE NINET April I leave, therefore, the maturity of his fame confidently to time to accomplish. His work is imperishable, but, alas ! how shall we perpetuate the memory of his personality, which has perished from amongst us ? This was more wonderful and rare than all his work. We can only weep and hold it dear to our hearts, for in truth he was the brightest, best, and most beloved of men. W ilfrid S cawen B lunt. Sheykh Obeyd, near Cairo : January 14, 1892.1892 577 VEGETABLE I DO not write this paper with the intention of converting or even convincing anybody, for nobody is more impressed with, the great truth that what is good for one person is not good for all. The infi nite individuality of the human race is what distinguishes it from animals. A certain kind of food will be liked and digested by all animals belonging to the same species, whilst, as an eminent doctor remarked the other day, there is not one article of food in the whole world which is eaten with pleasure by every human being alike. All I wish to do is to put my experiences before those to whom they may be useful, and who may profit by them without making the disagreeable mistakes my ignorance led me into. I have all my life thought that meat-eating was objectionable from the aesthetic point of view. Even as a child the fashion of handing around a huge grosse piece on an enormous dish revolted my sense of beauty ; and I was delighted when, on my first visit to England, a small and thin slice of beef was unobtrusively shown to me behind my left shoulder, to be accepted or rejected I quite agree with Lord Byron, who said he would not marry a pretty girl because she had asked for two helps of lobster salad, though if beef steak had been substituted I should understand it better still. The hiftek a Vanglaise, which seems to be the only idea a foreign waiter ever has when he is asked to suggest something to eat to English- speaking travellers, is simply a piece of hot raw meat, far more fit for the Zoological Gardens than for human food; for, despite of constant and sometimes indignant disclaimers, it is generally believed on the Continent that it forms the staple food of the British nation— that the strong limbs of the young men, the lovely complexions of the girls, and the bright eyes of the children are entirely due to this nourishment, and anxious mothers of families abroad are constantly impressing upon their offspring and everybody else about them the utility and necessity of this panacea, if they wish to be in good health and feel fit and strong. It is a curious fact that in places where this regimen of viandesaignante is followed anaemia is very frequent. I have been told, though I have not read it myself, that somebody has written a description of a town where the whole population was578 THE NINETEENTH April vegetarian. The change this would make in all the sights and smells is far greater than we at first imagine. The ghastly butchers' shops which meet one at every turn appear to me an incongruity, not to say more, in this civilised age; they would disappear, as well as the fishmongers', which are hardly any better. Then there are the sausage shops, which, especially in southern countries, persecute one with their pungent odour. How often have I been driven away whilst admir ing the fapade of an old palazzo or the portico of an ancient church by the emanations of the terrible pizzicheria half-way down the street. Another dread sight which meets our eyes abroad, especially in Grermany and Austria, where much veal is eaten, are the slaughtered calves paraded about the streets, a dozen or two of them hanging over the sides of the cart. There can be little doubt, too, that our kitchens and dining-rooms would be far more sweet and attractive if no animal food was ever brought into them. The eyes certainly would be gainers, and our olfactory senses too. In pictures and in poetry the tables are laid out with luscious fruit and sparkling wines, whenever charming and pleasant scenes are to be conjured up before our minds. When coarseness and discomfort are portrayed, ' men brought in whole hogs and quarter-beeves, and all the hall was dim with steam of flesh.' It is the difference between one of Griulio Eomano's garden banquets, such as he painted in the vaulted chambers of the Palazzo del Te, and a peasant orgie by Ostade or Teniers. It is not, however, this aspect of the Pythagorean regime which will make many converts, nor did it ever influence me for very long, as most doctors lay, or rather laid, about twenty years ago, so much stress upon the eating of sufficient meat and the anaemic tendency of this generation that one naturally felt it one's first duty to prefer health to beauty. A moie serious consideration, and one which grew upon me ever}/ year, was the sad and distasteful necessity of killing a living being in order to live oneself. The great mystery of pain in this world, which if it once gets a hold upon the mind is so terribly difficult to shake off, often dimmed my greatest pleasures. But this feeling too I tried, but less successfully, to subordinate to what I then con sidered right and reasonable. The first serious shock I experienced in this theory was when, a few years ago, one of the most eminent German professors from a great university dined at our table, and would not touch anything because he was a vegetarian. I looked over the bill of fare, and realised with consternation that everything down to the sweet was either meat or fish or fowl, that vegetables and farinaceous food played the very smallest part in it, and even they were tainted with sauces not free from re proach. I had the evening before listened to an historical discourse delivered1892 VEGETABLE 579 by Professor 0 to an audience of all tliat is most intelligent and distinguished in this city. I had been struck by his extraordinary vigour and clearness. The words dropped like pearls from his lips, and though the voice was scarcely raised it appeared to search out the remotest corners of the hall. Every rounded-off sentence pre sented a vivid picture to the mind. The subject was the chancellor Prince Metternich, and we all felt when, after an hour and a half, Pro fessor 0 ended apparently quite as fresh and collected as when he began, that we not only knew the Prince personally, but that we understood his politics and the workings of his mind far better than his contemporaries had done. The thing which, however, impressed me most, was the sense of power held back, and to the good as it were, which the Professor gave me whilst speaking, and even after he had finished. When, therefore, the next day he told me that he never touched animal food, I was very curious to hear his experiences. He told me that some years before he had been very ill, nigh unto death, and given up by all the doctors. Then came one who said he could cure him. All the strong soups and beef jellies and raw minced meat were eliminated and replaced by fruit and light farinaceous food, but fruit especially, and he soon got well and strong —so well and strong, indeed, that he determined to go on with his simple fare, especially as he felt an unwonted ease and extraordinary lucidity of the intellect when working. His wife, he told me, soon followed his example, and also his daughters and sons-in-law. At last his servants came and said they would like to be vegetarians too, as it seemed to agree so well with their masters. I felt that where so clever a man was so fully convinced of the expediency and effi ciency of this diet that he carried his whole family and household with him, he must have gone into the question deeply, and have the very best reasons upon which to found his belief. I could not enter with him into further discussion, as he had to leave Vienna, but he sent me some books on the subject. These books were German, and they would be well worth translating, for their whole tone is like a bracing mountain air. In every one of them vegetable diet is the foundation whereon is built an edifice of hygiene, which if we could or would but strictly follow might bring us to a pinnacle of animal spirits and bodily vigour only to be compared to the centaur of Henri de Gruerin. To those who have not read this charming frag ment, let me recommend it as a tonic on a day of languor and pros tration. The thorough enjoyment of life and strength in which the centaur revels whilst careering over wind-swept plains, down breezy mountain-sides, plunging into deep green forests with the scent of the earth and wood flowers in the air, is better than any dose of sal-volatile or quinine. These little German books, for none of them are very long, have mainly for their object to bring us back to a healthier and simpler mode of life. They are full of cold water580 THE NINETEENTH April and open windows by day and by night. Sun-baths and air-baths in the woods and on the hills, swimming and gymnastics, everything on the simplest and most economical lines, as they are mainly written for schools and the middle classes, where expensive adjuncts must be omitted. No medicines are tolerated by the strict vegetarian; every thing is cured by diet, exercise, water, hot or cold, or in the shape of steam. There are now all over Germany and Austria a great number of what is called ' Nature Doctors/ who cure on these principles, though they need not necessarily be vegetarians. The poor prefer them, as they are often men well off, who have a vocation for this calling ; the medicaments cost very little or nothing. Father Sebastian Kneipp, at Worichshofen in Suabia, belongs to this class, and the thousands he cures every year have made his name famous in all the German- speaking lands. He too deprecates the use of much meat. Every where baths and sanatoriums are springing up where cures with these simple means alone are effected, and medicines utterly discarded. The Hygeia, a publication founded by the well-known Doctor Paul Niemeyer, and edited at Munich by his disciple and successor. Dr. Gerster, is one of the many organs of the new and in dependent school; many doctors and a few laymen write in it. It is interesting and amusing, full of unexpected information, and much read by the most intelligent section of the public. The German vegetarian books are full of a number of excellent recipes for dishes of all kinds, suited to every time of the year and to different countries, which is most important, for the new-fledged vegetarian always thinks he is going to die of hunger. In the preparation of vegetables the German Pythagoreans bear off the palm, and I am bound to say that even their puddings and sweets are better than those known to the meat-eater. From what I have heard of English vegetarianism, I fancy that the movement, which in many lespects might prove so useful, is much impeded by the inadequate way in which the vegetables are cooked, and until this defect is thoroughly remedied, and a greater variety is introduced into the vegetarian bill of fare, there is no prospect of an extension, which might prove so great a boon to the poorer classes. In spite of the persuasive language of my books, and the promise of health and happiness, I could not, somehow, make up my mind to take a step which I imagined would in a certain way cut me off from my fellow-creatures 5 and it was not till rather more than a year ago, when I was obliged to read up certain papers about the transport of cattle and slaughter-houses, that the irresistible conviction came upon me, that I must choose between giving up the eating of animal food or my peace of mind. \ ears ago, when I lived in Italy, this same subject had given me much pain. At Rome it was the habit for every butcher to have his1892 VEGETABLE 581 own boys in the slaughter-houses to kill the cattle. These boys were often unskilful or not strong enough. When the beautiful milk- white oxen, with their large, pathetic black eyes, were brought to be slaughtered, these butcher boys had often to give thirty blows before the poor beast fell. Every animal that was brought into the town paid by weight at the octroi, but they were generally kept waiting for days in sheds outside the town. In these sheds there were drinking-rfountains always running, but the plug at the bottom was taken out, so as to prevent the animals from drinking, and thus their weight was lightened. The railway companies never dreamt of watering the cattle during the many days that they were packed together in the trucks, sweltering and faint under the fierce Italian sun. The Roman Society for Protection of Animals sent a dozen pails to Foligno, a central railway station, offering to pay a certain sum annually for the watering of the cattle. The pails were returned after two years, never having been used once. Nor are things much better in this country. The cattle which come up from Transylvania and other distant parts of the Empire are neither fed nor watered on the journey, which sometimes takes a week. Then when unshipped they are tied together in threes and fours, hit and frightened, and thus driven to the slaughter-houses. They sometimes fall down in the road from terror and exhaustion. Galician pigs often lie in thousands for a week together in the snow and slush outside the slaughter-houses, waiting to be killed. Thus far my own experience and things I have seen. In England, if I am to believe newspaper paragraphs and statistics, things are as bad if not worse. For a short resV'Tuof the horrors attending the transport of cattle by land and by sea, let anybody whom it interests turn to pages 65—69 of Dr. A. Kingsford's ' Perfect Way in Diet, headed ' The Sufferings of Cattle,' and they will learn well authenti cated facts which will fill them with pain and disgust. The following figures are sufficiently significant. They are taken from the report of the Veterinary Department of the Privy Council for the year 1879. In 1879, 157 cargoes of Canadian cattle were shipped for Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London, in which total there were 25,185 oxen, 73,913 sheep, and 3,663 pigs; but of this number 154 oxen, 1,623 sheep, and 249 pigs were thrown into the sea during the passage, 21 oxen, 226 sheep, and 3 pigs were landed dead, and 4 oxen and 61 sheep were so wounded and suffering on arriving that they had to be slaughtered on the spot. In the same year there were shipped from the United States for the ports of Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Grimsby, Hartlepool, Hull, Leith, Liverpool, London, Newcastle-on-Tyne, South Shields, and Southampton 535 cargoes of animals, of which 76,117 were oxen, 119,350 sheep, 15,180 pigs; but of this number 3,140 oxen, 5,915 sheep, and 2,943 pigs were cast into582 THE NINETEENTH April the sea during the transit; 221 oxen, 386 sheep, and 392 pigs arrived dead at the place of landing; and 93 oxen, 167 sheep, and 130 pigs were so mutilated that they had to be sacrificed on the spot. In resume, 14,024 animals were thrown into the sea, 1,240 were landed dead, and 455 were slaughtered on the quay to save them dying of their wounds and sufferings. One asks oneself what state the remaining animals were in, which were sold for human food ? It is not an unnatural or far-fetched idea to connect this state of things with the excessive and inexplicable extension of cancer within the last decade. The more and the further cattle is transported under these conditions, the more tainted (though perhaps not per ceptibly so) meat must be eaten, the more poison is infused into the blood. It is not possible that the flesh of an animal which has been knocked about, frightened, starved, exposed to the heat of the sun or icy cold for days and weeks, should be as healthy as that of those taken from our own fields and slaughtered at once, as was the case in the days of our ancestors. These considerations, however, were not the only ones that moved me. I do not think that anybody has the right to indulge in tastes which oblige others to follow a brutalising occupation, which morally degrades the man who earns his bread by it. To call a man a butcher means that he is fond of bloodshed. Butchers often become mur derers. I remember two cases in the papers last summer where butchers had been hired to murder individuals whom they did not even know. After this comes the irrepressible thought. Is it right to take life in order to feed oneself, when there is plenty of other available food which will do just as well ? Having answered these questions to my own satisfaction, I plunged at once into full-blown vegetarianism. I got very little to eat, and that not very good, for neither I nor my cook were hauteur of the situation. I had, however, one, and that a very great compensation I felt superior to my fellow-beings, treading on air, my head delightfully clear, and altogether lifted up above material things. The Poet Laureate's lines to Fitzgerald will give in a few words the story of my first and unsuccessful attempt. . . . live on milk and meat and grass ; And once for ten long weeks I tried Your table of Pythagoras, And seem'd at first a thing enskied (As Shakespeare has it), airy-light, To float above the ways of men, Then fell from that half-spiritual height Chill'd, till I tasted flesh again. I, too, felt chilled and sleepy by day and night, so tired that I could hardly walk. The doctor said, ' You have no pulse at all, and must give in; it does not suit you.' The winter was icy cold and1892 VEGETABLE 583 depressing, and for the moment I followed Tennyson's example. Mais je ne reculais que pour mi and with the first breath of spring, when all those delightful fruits and leaves and roots which Eaphael did not disdain to paint as ornaments in his loggias reappear on our tables, I made my second methodical and successful attempt, eliminating week by week one kind of animal food only, and replacing it by some equally nutritious vegetable preparation. The very strict ascetic sect of vegetarians who only live upon seeds and uncooked food look down upon their weaker brethren who eat eggs and milk and butter, in fact, everything which does not necessitate the taking of life, which appears to me to be the only reasonable standpoint. I will not, therefore, enter into discussions whether our teeth are those of a carnivorous or frugivorous animal, though the latter appears to me the most likely theory, as fruits are the only edibles we can eat and digest without cooking; everything else requires the aid of fire to make it palatable and wholesome. It is certain that the giving up of animal food cures many illnesses which no medicines can reach. Everybody knows the bad effects of butcher's meat in gout and rheumatism. In affections of the heart it is often the only remedy, and the wonderful results are not difficult to explain in a case where rest often means cure, if one reflects that whilst the meat-eater's heart has seventy-two beats in the minute the vegetarian's only has fifty-eight beats, therefore 20,000 beats less in the course of the twenty-four hours. Insomnia and nervousness are affected in the same way ; there is less wear and more repose in the constitution. I could enumerate many other illnesses in which vegetable diet does marvels, but will only mention those of the skin. Most vegetarians have unusually clear and often beautiful complexions. I need only remind those who know them of the old Carthusian and Trappist monks, who all have smooth white and pink Angelico kind of faces, which are not found amongst the Orders that do not habitually live on Lenten fare. The splendid teeth of the Italian peasantry, whenever touch meat, speak for themselves, and it is the same in other countries where the people live under similar conditions. It is foolish to associate vegetable diet with temperance, as so many do : they are quite astonished to see a vegetable-eater drinking wine or beer. One thing, however, is true, viz. that it is far easier to cure a drunkard if you deprive him of meat, because, as Dr. Jackson, head-doctor of the Asylum for Dipsomaniacs, Damville, United States, says, ' it is clear that meat contains some not nutri tious particles, which excite the nervous system so much that it at last becomes exhausted and unstrung. In this state of exhaustion unhealthy reaction follows, which brings on a paroxysm and violent desire for spirits and the excitement which they create.' G-. Biinge, professor of physiological chemistry at the University of Bale, writes, in his book on vegetarianism, p. 33 : ' The appetite of the drunkard584 THE NINETEENTH April is directed almost exclusively to animal food, and vegetarians are quite right when they teach that spirit-drinking and excessive use of animal food are in connection with each other.' Vegetarianism is often called a fad, but it is a healthy and an innocent one and the natural reaction against the present state of things. It imparts lightness and elasticity to the body, brightness and clearness to the mind. The vegetarians I know are all unusu ally strong, active, and young-looking people for their age: one of them walked without stopping for thirty-four, and another time twenty-seven hours, without a rest, whilst on an excursion in Norway, feats not easily equalled by the most inveterate beef-eater. Travelling, mountain-climbing, all seems easier and less fatiguing on this light and soothing diet; and why should it not give strength to the limbs and sinews if one reflects that all the strongest animals who do the heaviest work in the world, like horses, oxen, and elephants, are entirely herbivorous ? There is, of course, a great deal more to say on so wide a subject, but I have in these pages confined myself almost entirely to my own experiences. Being but a beginner myself there is much for me to learn, and I have not even touched on the possibilities and probabili ties this theme opens out into the domain of psychology. But only a few days ago one whose experience and knowledge on this subject are greater than those of most men told me he owed almost every thing he had attained in his domain to his strict adherence to vege table diet. It certainly gives, to those who live on these lines, a kind of detachment from material things, a sense of calm and content. It is in the hope of helping some who may feel nervous and worried in mind, or ill in body, that I write these lines, to point out a simple remedy everybody can apply. It not only costs nothing, but even puts money in our pockets—only, like everything else, it must be governed by good sense and reason in order to be successful. It is not my intention to be understood to say that I look upon vegetable diet, even with its necessary accompaniments of fresh air, frequent ablutions, gymnastics, and exercise, as a panacea for every thing, and that medicines become useless. We are mortal, and there is no perfection in this imperfect world. Nobody has a greater belief than I have in remedies judiciously given during illness, but it is the many who are out of health and below par, without hardly knowing what is the matter with them, who would be all the better for trying whether their discomforts spring from too high and rich a diet or from the inability to procure any but inferior meat or fish. In the first case they would soon feel their tired digestions rested and their irritated nerves calming down, whilst in the latter they would find out that it is easy to get a healthier and an equally satisfying meal for half the cost of what they were in the habit of spending before. Though these motives are not perhaps the highest which ought1892 VEGETABLE 585 to lead us to a result, they are those whicli exercise a roost general influence. The small number who change their mode of life from principle only know how far above bodily health the blessings are which grow out of the sacrifice. Before the eyes of everybody the lines of the Latin poet must conjure up a delightful and attractive picture: Forbear, 0 mortals, to taint your bodies witb forbidden food; Corn bave we ; the bougbs bend under a load of fruit; Our vines abound in swelling grapes ; our fields witb wholesome berbs, Wbereof tbose of a cruder kind may be softened and mellowed by fire. Nor is milk denied us, nor boney smelling of tbe fragrant tbyme ; Eartb is lavish of her riches, and teems with kindly stores, Providing without slaughter or bloodshed for all manner of delights. W alb . P aget. Vienna.586 THE NINETEENTH April THE STORY OF GIFFO One of the inveterate traditions in English literary history is that which ascribes the premature death of the poet Keats to a savage criticism of his Endymion in the It may be worthwhile to reinvestigate this old story in the light of our most recent information respecting the life and character of Keats, especially that supplied by Mr. Sidney Colvin's edition of Keats's collected letters. It was Shelley that originated the legend. When Keats died at Eome in February 1821, Shelley, who had seen something of him personally, though they had never been on terms of close intimacy, was residing at Pisa, about a hundred and fifty miles north from Eome; and it was there that, only a few weeks after he had received the news of the too early decease of his young brother-poet, he gave such generous expression to his feelings over the event by penning and publishing his famous elegy and encomium on Keats entitled Adonais. In a prose preface prefixed to the elegy there was this paragraph:— The genius of the lamented person to whose memory I have dedicated these unworthy verses was not less delicate and fragile than it was beautiful; and, where canker-worms abound, what wonder if its young flower was blighted in the bud ? The savage criticism on his Endymion which appeared in the produced the most violent effect on his susceptible mind; the agitation thus originated ended in a rupture of a blood-vessel in the lungs; a rapid consumption ensued; and the succeeding acknowledgments from more candid critics of the true greatness of his powers were ineffectual to heal the wound thus wantonly inflicted. The same story pervades the text of the elegy itself, and is em bodied particularly in those stanzas in which Shelley exerts all his powers of language in denunciation of the anonymous reviewer in the Quarterly —the ' nameless worm,' he calls him, the ' deaf and viperous murderer'—who had been the cause of all the disaster, and predicts for him a future of execration and infamy. The article having been anonymous, Shelley does not venture to name the man he thus de nounces; but, as (xifford himself, the redoubted editor of the Quarterly from its commencement in 1809 to the year 1824, was universally credited at the time with the authorship of the criticism on Endymion, there can be no doubt that it was Grifford that Shelley1892 THE STORY OF GIF FORD KEATS 587 meant. To this day tlie belief tliat Gifford was the culprit has never been seriously disturbed. Dr. Smiles, indeed, in the recently pub lished Memoir and Gorres'pondence speaks of the article as known to have been ' written by Mr. Croker,' but without producing the precise vouchers required for such a statement. Till that is done, Gifford, who is responsible for the article at all events as having procured it and adopted it, must continue to be held responsible for it wholly. But, if the legend as to the cause of Keats's death originated with Shelley, it was Byron that helped it into immediate circulation. Byron, who was residing at Venice at the time of the publication of Shelley's Adonais at Pisa, had seen an early copy of it. ' Are you aware,' he wrote on the 30th of July, 1821, to his London publisher, Mr. Murray, who was also proprietor of the that Shelley has written an elegy on Keats and accuses the of killing him ? ' In the same month Byron had versified the piece of gossip, for his own amusement and Mr. Murray's, thus : 'Who killed Jolm Keats ? i I,' says the So savage and tartarly; ' 'Twas one of feats.' In November 1821 Byron removed from Venice to Pisa; and it may have been his companionship with Shelley in Pisa that led to that higher and more serious appreciation of Keats's merits all in all which we find him expressing in a manuscript note on the 12th of that month. In this note he first repeats Shelley's story, and then proceeds: I have read the article before and since; and, though it is bitter, I do not think tliat a man should permit himself to he killed hy it. But a young man little dreams what he must inevitably encounter in the course of a life ambitious of public notice. My indignation at Mr, Keats's depreciation of Pope has hardly permitted me to do justice to his own genius, which, all the fantastic fopperies of his style, was undoubtedly of great promise. His fragment of Hyperion seems actually inspired by the Titans, and is as sublime as JEschylus. He is a loss to our literature. In these words there seems just a hint that Byron, even while repeating Shelley's story, had begun to have some doubts as to its truth. It was too pungent a story, however, to be altogether given up; and accordingly, in the eleventh canto of published in the following year, Byron reproduced it in this well-known stanza:— John Keats, who was killed off by one critique, Just as he really promised something great, If not intelligible, without Greek Contrived to talk about the gods of late Much as they might have been supposed to speak. Poor fellow ! his was an untoward fate; 'Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle, Should let itself be snuffed out by an article.588 THE NINETEENTH April One would have thouglit that, during the long tract of seventy- years through which this stanza of Byron's has been quoted, and that story of Shelley's to which it lent epigrammatic point has continued more or less current, mere natural curiosity would have induced hundreds of persons to make direct acquaintance with the terrible article charged with such tragic consequences. But people are indo lent in such matters ; and what Byron's shrewd common-sense led him to do in 1821—viz. read the notorious article for himself, to test its killin g power—seems to have been done by very few since. Anyone who chooses, however, may now take down from a library shelf Volume XIX. of the Quarterly Review, containing the numbers for April and July 1818, and there see the article on Keats's It is the seventh article in the first of these numbers; which number, however, was not actually out, both Mr. Buxton Forman and Mr. Sidney Colvin inform us, till the last week of September. The actual article, I am sure, will considerably surprise those who may have judged of it by hearsay. It will surprise, in the first place, by its extreme brevity and slightness. Instead of being an onslaught in thirty pages or so, as one would have expected of an article credited with such crushing and death-dealing effect, it is a wretched little thing of exactly four pages altogether. It cannot have been the bulk of the article, therefore, that overwhelmed Keats ; it must have been the killing quality of the matter of the four pages. Let us see. Reviewers have been sometimes accused [so the article opens] of not reading the works they affected to criticise. On the present occasion we shall anticipate the authors complaint, and honestly confess that we have not read his work. Not that we have been wanting in our duty,—far from it: indeed, we have made efforts almost as superhuman as the story appears to be to get through it; but, with the fullest stretch of our perseverance, we are forced to confess that we have not been able to struggle beyond the first of the four Books of which this poetic romance consists. We should extremely lament this want of energy, or whatever it may be, on our parts, were it not for one consolation—namely, that we are no better acquainted with the meaning of the Book through which we have so pain fully toiled, than we are with that of the three which we have not looked into. A few words of qualified praise are then interjected. It is not [says the Reviewer] that Mr. Keats (if that be his real name, for we almost doubt that any man in his senses would put his real name to such a rhapsody)—it is not, we say, that the author has not powers of language, rays of fancy, and gleams of genius: he has all these; but he is, unhappily, a disciple of the new school of what has somewhere been called Cockney poetry—which may be defined to consist in the most incongruous ideas in the most uncouth language. Then, after referring sarcastically to Leigh Hunt as the chief of this school, and characterising the author of as ' a copyist of Mr. Hunt/ but ' more unintelligible, almost as rugged, twice as diffuse, and ten times more tiresome and absurd,' the Reviewer glances at the story of the poem.1892 THE STORY OF GIFFO 589 Of the story [he says] we have been able to make out but little: it seems to be mythological, and probably relates to the loves of Diana and Endymion; but of this, as the scope of the work has altogether escaped us, we cannot speak with any degree of certainty, and must therefore content ourselves with giving some in stances of its diction and versification. The rest of the article, accordingly, consists of an attack upon Keats, illustrated by two quotations, for the occult waywardness and capriciousness of his style, the evident dependence of the sequence of his fancies on the mere rhymes that have occurred to him, followed by examples of what the Eeviewer considers lines of incorrect and limping prosody and by examples of what he regards as untasteful words and phrases. Among the last he quotes ' turtles passion their voices,' ' men-slugs and human serpentry,' ' honey-feel of bliss,' the ' multitude upfollowed,' ' pantingly and close,' ' a ripply cove,' ' re- freshfully,' and others. Save that it is all done rather stupidly and in an ill-natured spirit, the specification here of Keats's chief faults is not very different from that which has been made over and over again, and would be still allowed, by some of Keats's most ardent admirers. Bitter and ill-natured the whole article certainly was, and such as could not fail to annoy any eager young author, and depress him for a day or two; but surely, as Byron thought, not such as any author with ' a stalk of carl-hemp' in him would have permitted himself to be killed by. Scores of very savage articles on new books appear every month now-a-days in our newspapers and literary reviews, without killing the authors of the books, or even putting them in misery beyond the first four-and-twenty hours ; and the literary savagery of the world in which Keats lived was more reckless- and outrageous than anything of the sort known now. Keats had only to look about him to see poets who had been slaughtered over and over again in reviews surviving the slaughter comfortably enough, or even radiantly and smilingly. For fifteen years, as he knew, there- had been a systematic series of attacks on Wordsworth by Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review a hundred times more ferocious than this poor four-page article on himself in the ; and yet there was Wordsworth going about in the Lake district of his habitation as hale and serene as ever, climbing mountains and leading otherwise his customary open-air life as heartily as if no Jeffrey existed, and, when he did chance to come to London, welcomed and pressed round in the selectest circle of Keats's own acquaintance there as the greatest English poet of his time, as a sage, a non-such, almost a demigod. So, in varying degrees, with the Laureate Southey and others, all of whom had been similarly mauled by the Eeviewers. Nay, and this is a fact in the history of the case that has been strangely for gotten or overlooked,—if Keats could have been killed by a savage review of his Endymion, he ought to have been dead before this one saw the light. The small article in the as we have seen. VOL. XXXI—NO. 182 S S590 THE NINETEENTH April appeared in tlie end of September, 1818 ; but in the preceding month, i.e., in August, 1818, there had appeared a considerably longer, much cleverer, and far more damaging article on Keats and his poetry in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Blackwood was then in the second year of its formidable existence; and it was in its columns that there had been invented that phrase, ' The Cockney school of poetry,' which we have seen the writer of the Quarterly article using so cautiously, and with such an affectation of ignorance as to the place of its origin. In particular, a contributor signing himself ' Z ' had taken upon him the business of lashing all those London poets and other writers that Blackiuood chose to class as of the Cockney school. He had begun a series of papers expressly under the title of 'The Cockney School of Poetry'; the series had been broken off after the publication of Nos. 1 and 2 ; but, after an interval, filled up by independent attacks on Hazlitt, and a special invective in the number for May, 1818, entitled ' Letter from ' Z ' to Leigh Hunt, King of the Cockneys,' it had been resumed in July, 1818. No. 3 of the series then appeared in the form of another onslaught on Leigh Hunt, the tremendous scurrility of which outran all previous bounds. ' Our hatred and contempt of Leigh Hunt as a writer are the opening words ; the article is garnished throughout by such epithets as ' offending scribbler against the laws of (rod and man,' ' his polluted muse,' ' guilty of falsehood'; and in the last paragraph there is this threat,—' Leigh Hunt is delivered into our hands to do with him as we will; our eye shall be upon him, and, unless he amend his ways, to wither and to blast him.' In the course of the article, I have observed, a line implying praise of Leigh Hunt's poetry is contemptuously quoted from one of Keats's early sonnets. This was ominous of the fact that Keats's own turn was coming; and the omen was fulfilled in the following month, when there came forth ' Cockney School of Poetry, No. 4,' entirely devoted to Keats. The article begins with a reference to the extraordinary recent prevalence of the disease of Metromania, or passion for verse-making, among all ranks and both sexes,—the swarming of poetlings and poetasters everywhere. To witness tlie disease of any liuman understanding, however feeble [it then proceeds], is distressing; but the spectacle of an able mind reduced to a state of insanity is, of course, ten times more afflicting. It is with such sorrow as this that we have contemplated the case of Mr. John Keats. This young man appears to have received from nature talents of an excellent, perhaps even of a superior, or d er talents which, devoted to the purposes of any useful profession, must have rendered him a respectable, if not an eminent, citizen. His friends, we understand, destined Tn'm to the career of medicine, and he was bound apprentice some years afo to a worthy apothecary in town. But all has been undone by a sudden attack of the malady to which we have alluded. The Eeviewer then takes up Keats's first small volume of miscellaneous 'Poems,' published in March, 1817, a year before his1892 THE STORY OFGIFFORD^ AND 591 Endymion. About half-a-dozen quotations are made from this volume, with interspersed banter of the young poet under the familiar name of ' Mr. John' or ' Johnny,' and ironical comments on his connection with Leigh Hunt and the rest of the Cockney set, but with no definite criticism beyond what may be implied in such phrases as 4 this gossamer work,'' the following prurient and vulgar lines,' and the italicising for the eye of one or two of those Cockney rhymes with which Keats sometimes marred his verse. 5 So much for the opening bud; now for the expanded flower,' says the Keviewer, then leaving the early volume, and passing to the Here also he is severe, without showing very distinctly why. The chief theme is still the young poet's connection with the abominable Leigh Hunt. From Ms prototype Hunt [we are told] John Keats lias acquired a sort of vague idea that the Greeks were a most tasteful people, and that no mythology can be so finely adapted for the purposes of poetry as theirs. It is amusing to see what a hand the two Cockneys make of this mythology : the one confesses that he never read the Greek tragedians, and the other knows Homer only from Chapman; and both of them write about Apollo, Pan, Nymphs, Muses, and Mysteries, as might be expected from persons of their education. The conception of Endymion is declared to be utterly un- Grecian. No man [it is said] whose mind has ever been imbued with the smallest know ledge or feeling of classical poetry or classical history could have stooped to pro fane and vulgarise every association in the manner which has been adopted by this ' son of promise.' The execution is pronounced no better than the conception. Mr. Keats [says the Reviewer] has adopted the loose, nerveless versification and Cockney rhymes of the poet of Rimini ; but, in fairness to that gentleman, we must add that the defects of the system are tenfold more conspicuous in his disciple's work than in his own. Mr. Hunt is a small poet, but he is a clever man. Mr. Keats is a still smaller poet, and he is only a boy of pretty abilities, which he has done everything in his power to spoil. Some specimen quotations are then given, with intimation that they must suffice, and that the Eeviewer has ' no patience for going over four books filled with such amorous scenes as these, with subter raneous journeys equally amusing, and submarine processions equally beautiful.' But the climax of contempt is reached in the last paragraph; where the Eeviewer takes farewell of his victim with these cutting words:— 'We venture to make one small prophecy—that his bookseller will not a second time venture 50Z. on anything he can write. It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet: so back to the shop, Mr. John, back to the plasters, pills, and ointment-boxes, &amp;c. But, for Heaven's sake, young Sangrado, be a little more sparing of extenuatives and soporifics in your prac tice than you have been in your poetry. s s 2592 THE NINETEENTH April Such, was the Blackwood article on Keats in August, 1818. It had. the priority of the Quarterly article by a whole month, or more nearly two months, and was a much heavier and more cruel blow. It is probable indeed that the writer of the article had read the Blackwood article, and merely followed suit. And so, as I may repeat, if Keats was capable of being killed by an unfavourable review, he ought to have been dead or dying already before Gifford lifted his clumsy club against him in the At the utmost Gifford can have been but the ' Second Murderer' in the tragedy, the part of the ' First Murderer ' having fallen to the truculent ' Z ' of Blackwood's Magazine. Who was this truculent ' Z ' ? Neither has that secret been ever divulged authoritatively; but the natural guess has been that he was either John Wilson, afterwards famous as- t Christopher North,' or John Gibson Lockhart, afterwards the son-in- law and biographer of Scott. Blackwood in those days had no recognised editor, the supreme management being kept by the publisher in hi&amp; own hands ; but Wilson and Lockhart were his two officers-in-chief, the founders of the fame of the magazine, and the contributors, separately or conjointly, of most of those articles of flame and vitriol that spread its early terrors. All the probabilities are that it was Lockhart, the younger of the two—Keats's senior, in fact, but by one year—that wrote the Keats article ; and, if so, it is somewhat curious- that, of the two attacks of 1818 on Keats, one should have been fathered by Gifford, then editor of the and the other andl earlier should have been written by the man who was to succeed Gifford in the editorship of the same While the Shelley-and-Byron legend as to the cause of the death of Keats thus breaks down in its original form, may it not, however, be retained in a modified form ? May it not be true that, though the Quarterly article was not responsible singly for the death of Keats, that disaster was caused by the effects upon him of the two nearly simultaneous articles of abuse and contempt—the article stunning him first, and the article completing the shock ? Let us see whether the facts of the case are consistent with that modified hypothesis. In April, 1818, Endymion was published, Keats was twenty- two years and six months old. ' A loose, slack, not well-dressed youth/ was Coleridge's curt recollection of him from one casual encounter ; but the accounts that have been left of him by those who knew him in timately, and cherished his memory most fondly after he was gone, are more precise and enthusiastic. Of small stature, but well-built,, with an expression of frank courage and eager power in the face, large and lustrous eyes, and hair of a golden brown, he was, they unanimously tell us, one of the most impressive and loveable young fellows ever seen,—manly and generous, affectionate and kindly.1892 THE STORY OF GIF FORD KEATS 593 usually full of frolic, fun, and animal spirits, but subsiding on occasion into the quietly and deeply serious or into a mood of dreamy abstraction ; tremulously sensitive also to the beautiful or the noble in every form, and roused always to impetuous wrath by any mention of a mean or dishonourable action. Already for two years he had been a special favourite in that London and Hampstead circle of men of letters and artists—Leigh Hunt the chief of them and the oldest, but the painter Haydon, Charles Cowden Clarke, John Hamilton Eeynolds, Charles Wentworth Dilke, Charles Armitage Brown, and Joseph Severn also well remembered—among whom he had found •congenial refuge on abandoning the profession of surgeon-apothecary for which he had been brought up, and for which he had actually •qualified himself by some years of apprenticeship and by subsequent .attendance in one of the London hospitals. Poetry had become his all-absorbing passion ; and, having a small income from his share in a family fund that had been left under trust for the support of him- sself, two younger brothers, and a sister, he had been able to follow his bent, and devote himself wholly to a literary life. Among the friends amid whom he had been moving the expectation of what he would ultimately be and do had been from the first almost boundless ; and it was they that had induced him to publish the little trial- volume of 1817, containing a selection of the small miscellaneous pieces which he had written up to that date. The volume had attracted no public attention at the time, though it is memorable enough now on various grounds, and above all as containing those lines in which the young poet declared his consciousness that it was but a prelude, a mere tuning of the strings, in preparation for some thing higher and greater :— O for ten years, that I may overwhelm Myself in poesy, so I may do the deed That my own soul has to itself decreed ! The Endymion was the first consequence of this ecstatic vow. ' A long poem,' he had said, ' is the test of invention'; and, in spite of the dissuasions of Leigh Hunt, he had resolved to put himself to this test, and had chosen the Greek legend of Endymion and the Moon-Goddess for his subject. ' It will be a test of invention,' lie said, ' if I can make 4,000 lines out of this one bare circumstance and fill them with poetry.' Eight months of fitful exertion, partly in seclusion in the Isle of Wight and other retreats in the South of [England, but mainly at Hampstead, had produced the 4,000 hues; ,and in April, 1818, as has been said, the poem was out. At the time of its publication Keats was rusticating in Devonshire ; and, though he was back in London in June, it was only to prepare for a long walking-tour in Scotland in company with his friend ,€harles Brown. Passing through the English Lake-district, they594 THE NINETEENTH April were at Carlisle on the 1st of July; and thence, entering Scotland by Dnmfriessliire, they zig-zagged for a few days from Dumfries westward into Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtonshire; after which, and the interruption of a brief run across into Ireland, they recommenced in Ayrshire, and began a toilsome knapsack-tramp which carried them., sometimes in soaking rain, through Glasgow to Lochfyne and Inverary, and so through the west-coast Highlands and the Island of Mull, with visits to lona, Staffa, and Oban, and past Ben Nevis (which they climbed heroically), to as far north as Inverness. They were at Inverness on the 6th of August, and remained there till the 9th; when a feverish sore throat which Keats had caught in his wet walk through Mull, and which the Inverness doctor whom he con sulted thought rather alarming, obliged him to leave Brown to prosecute the journey farther north by himself. Nine days in a Cromarty smack brought Keats to London; where, on the 19th of August, he appeared among his Hampstead friends, as one of them reports, ' as brown and shabby as you can imagine, scarcely any shoes left, his jacket all torn at the back, a fur cap, a great plaid, and his knapsack.' He might have seen the attack upon him while he was in Scotland, but does not appear to have heard of it till his return to Hampstead. It was waiting for him there, three weeks after it had been published; and at the end of the following month he had to digest the Quarterly attack also. How did he take them ? To all appearance, very quietly. He cannot have liked them, of course, and must have known that they would damage him greatly; but they perturbed him far less than might have been expected. Pride and sound judgment came to his rescue ; and, while Leigh Hunt was resenting the indignities had suffered from Blacktvood by vehement public retaliation, and Hazlitt was raging over the insults to h in the same magazine, and threatening prosecution for libel, the younger man of genius said little, and seemed rather to be meditating what truth there might be in the criticisms on his Endymion, and how he might benefit by them. He does mention them once or twice in his letters, and most remarkably in one of the 9th of October, acknowledging receipt of copies of some newspaper articles which friends and admirers of his, indignant at the injustice done him, had published on his behalf. I cannot [lie wrote] but feel indebted to those gentlemen who have taken my part. As for the rest, I begin to get a little acquainted witb my own strength and weakness. Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own works. My own domestic criticism has given me pain without comparison beyond what Blackivood or the Quarterly could possibly inflict; and also, when I feel I am right, no external praise can give me such a glow as my own solitary reperception and ratification of what is fine. This is excellently expressed; and there is no reason to doubt1892 THE STORY OF GIF FORD 595 that it represents the real state of his feelings. None of the mad 4 agitation' here which Shelley imagined; no symptoms as yet of the rapture of a blood-vessel! Following Keats through the rest of his brief life, we still find no trace of the supposed effects upon him of the brutal treatment of his Endymion. He had anxieties enough; but they were from quite other causes. For the first three months after his return from his Scottish tour he was in constant and affectionate attendance on the deathbed of his youngest brother Tom, in whom, at the age of nineteen, the hereditary family-malady of consumption had for some time shown itself fatally. He died on the 1st of December, 1818 ; and there can be little doubt now that those months of close attendance on his deathbed had aggravated the mischief already done to Keats's own delicate constitu tion by the overstrained exertions of his Scottish tour. One seems to see, indeed, that it was by this time, or at this time, and by those two causes combined, that the taint of the hereditary malady which had carried off the one brother had been developed in the other to the point of mortal danger. Henceforth, at all events, we hear at intervals of ominous recurrences in Keats of the ' sore throat' he had brought with him from the wet moors of Mull, and become aware that, though he made light of these recurring illnesses to his friends, he diagnosed them and their possible portent more and more de- spondingly, from time to time, in his own private thoughts. Meanwhile, suppressing such gloomy prognostications, he was sufficiently busy. Even before End was quite off his hands he had begun a new and shorter poem in a different vein; in the course of his Scottish tour he had penned a few scraps of verse, sug gested by its incidents; during his attendance on his invalid brother he had sketched, and in part written, his ; and before the middle of 1819,-—living still at Hampstead, but domesticated now in the same house there with his bosom-friend Brown,—he had added to his manuscript stock nearly all his other later poetic pieces of chief value. A good deal of his leisure was occupied with letter- writing. His longest and most important letters were to his surviv ing brother George, who had married some time before, and emigrated with his wife to America to establish himself in business. More numerous, but shorter, were those to his only sister, Fanny Keats, a young girl of sixteen, then living not far from him in an outskirt of London, but sufficiently far to prevent his seeing her as often as he would have liked, inasmuch as she was under the guardianship of the family-trustee, Mr. Abbey, a London tea-merchant, and that gentle man and his wife were unusually strict in their custody of her. Both sets of letters are of singular autobiographical interest, not only as evidence of the strength of Keats's family-affection, but on intellectual and literary grounds. In this latter respect those to his brother596 THE NINETEENTH April George,—scribbled off in portions, journal-wise, to be dispatched in collective batches as opportunity offered,—are the most valuable. Generally wise and full of shrewd sense, as well as affectionate, they sparkle now and then with outbreaks of Keats's whimsical humour, while there are also passages in them of fine poetic conception, and of subtle and brilliant speculation. In the briefer letters and notes to his sister, written in his seasons of illness or when their chances of meeting were otherwise interfered with, it is the brotherly tenderness that we most admire, his carefulness in sending the young girl little advices for her health and for the useful employment of her time in the rather dull life she was leading ; but in them, too, he sometimes strikes a higher note, or exhibits his indomitable playfulness. Here, for example, is an extract from a letter to her dated the 17th of Aprii ; 1819:— Mr. and Mrs. Dilke are coming to dine with us to-day. They will enjoy the country after Westminster. O, there is nothing like fine weather, and health, and books, and a fine country, and a contented mind, and a diligent habit of reading and thinking as an amulet against ennui, and, please Heaven ! a little claret wine cool out of a cellar a mile deep, with a few or a good many ratafia cakes, a rocky basin to bathe in, a strawberry bed to say your prayers to Flora in, a pad nag to go your ten miles or so, two or three sensible people to chat with, two or three spiteful folks to spar with, two or three odd fishes to laugh at, and two or three numskulls to argue with. No passage of equal length could be quoted from Keats's letters more characteristic than this ; and it represents him, months after his supposed agony over the Blackwo and criticisms, as in no agony at all, but languidly passive as ever in that mood of delight in luxurious nerve-sensations of all sorts which had been con stitutional in him from the first, and which he has transfused into so much of his poetry. The old Shelley-and-Byron legend, therefore, is still discountenanced by the records. It is further discountenanced, however, by what we are told of a remarkable turn which occurred in the affairs and occupations of Keats about the middle of 1819. About this time it chanced that the family trustee, Mr. Abbey, who, though an honest man, was cautious and obstinate, and had often been troublesome to deal with, was alarmed by the threat of a lawsuit from an interested relative of the Keatses, in connection with his administration of the trust-funds. The consequence was that not only was there a stopping of some advances of money that were wanted by the American brother George for help in his business, but Keats's own finances were brought to a temporary standstill. Obliged thus to bethink himself of some means for his future support, should any future be before him, Keats turned various projects over in his mind. He thought, among other things, of going to Edinburgh to attend the medical classes there and become a regularly qualified physician. That project,—which would have been the adoption though after a more considerate fashion, of the advice given him by1892 THE STORY OF GIF FORD 597 his Blackwood reviewer to return to his gallipots,—was now abandoned; and, following the advice of Brown and other friends, Keats resolved to keep to literature. But why not now take to a more paying form of literature than he had found poetry to be, or at least such poetry as he could produce ? The drama promised better results; Brown had already some dramatic experience, and could give him instructions in stage requirements; why not, in conjunction with Brown, write a tragedy, to be acted at Drury Lane Theatre, with Edmund Kean in the principal part? Through the three autumn months of 1819, accordingly, Keats was away from London, first at Shanklin in the Isle of Wight, and then at Winchester, busy over a tragedy on the subject of Otho the Great, and beginning also an English historical play, to be called King Stephen, —Brown with him for the greater part of the time, and another friend or two occasionally. Not for a long while had Keats's health been better, or his spirits higher, than during the part of this busy absence which was spent in Winchester. Another idea had then occurred to him, should his dramatic attempts not succeed. Without absolutely giving up poetry, why should he not, on his return to London, betake himself for a subsistence, as so many others were doing, to journalism and contributorship to peri odicals ? He was sufficiently known to obtain that kind of employ ment on seeking for it ; and Hazlitt could help him to it at once ! With this resolution in his mind, and the further resolution that it would be best for his purpose not to keep house any longer with Brown at Hampstead, but to live in lodgings by himself near the newspaper and magazine offices, he was back in London in October, 1819. Alas! only to break down again most hopelessly ! He had not been ten days in a lodging that had been taken for him near the Dilkes at Westminster, when he gave up the experiment as un endurable, and returned to the society of Brown at Hampstead. The attraction thither, as we first learn definitely at this point in his biography, was special and irresistible. In the next house to Brown's at Hampstead lived Mrs. Brawne, a widowed lady of some independent means, with her three children, the eldest of whom, Fanny Brawne, nineteen years of age, and described by Mr. Colvin as of the ' English hawk-blonde type' of beauty, had so fascinated Keats, though at first her style and manners had rather repelled him, that, without the knowledge of any of his friends hitherto, except Brown, he had been engaged to her for the last ten months. The biographers will have it that it was the renewed influence of this love-engagement after his three or four months of absence, the renewed vicinity and sight of Fanny Brawne day after day, acting upon him with the kind of scorching allurement which keeps the moth circling round the flame, that threw him now into the state of wild excitement, alternating with fits of fretful dejection, in which he598 THE NINETEENTH April is found through the winter of 1819-20. Partly they may be right; but the real cause which had evoked this one into such morbid excess of activity was, I believe, nothing else than the suddenly accelerated progress at this time of the disease which was consuming him,—this acceleration bringing with it new physical suffering in the form of a continual burning unrest, and a consequent conviction now, rather than a mere suspicion as occasionally heretofore, that he had not long to live. It is not as if his love for Fanny Brawne was itself his torture; it is as if, feeling the clutches of death upon him, he had fastened with a kind of angry wonder on the fact that to all the other bonds with the living world which had so soon to be snapped the irony of Fate had added, too cruelly, this of so futile a love- engagement. Confirmation of this view of the case will be found, I think, in those of Keats's love-letters to Fanny Brawne—they have all been recently published, for now-a-days people will publish any thing—which he had written to her from Shanklin and Winchester in the immediately preceding months. They do not reveal, as yet at least, anything of that ' profound passion' which the biographers have discerned in the relations of Keats to his betrothed; on the contrary, they strike one as coldish, constrained, and artificially- gallant ; but they contain phrases which do flash out what I conceive to have been the thought secretly preying on Keats all the while. ' I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks, your loveliness and the hour of my death : 0 that I could have possession of them both at the same minute,' he says, in one of them, sent from Shanklin and the words had been significant even then. Now that he was again beside her, there is evidence of a rise in the fervour of his affection to nearer the pitch of delirium; but this also connects itself, one finds, with the agitation within him of the one central thought of his approaching death, correspondingly raised in intensity as that also had been by the suddenly accelerated ravage of his disease. ' I cannot exist without you ; I am forgetful of everything but seeing you again; my life seems to stop there; I can see no further; you have absorbed me,' he says in one letter just after his return from Winchester; and again, in another, ' I shall be able to do nothing; I should like to cast the die for Love or Death.' His thoughts of Fanny Brawne and Death together, we can see, had taken the form of a preternatural kind of jealousy. What! in a few months should he be in his grave, a kneaded clod, while there should be still a living world overhead, with all its bustling myriads, and she should be amongst them,—the beautiful, the wayward, the shallow-hearted, as he half knew her to be, but 0 her unsurpassable witchery!—smiling and laughing in carelessness that had ever existed, and maddening others as she had maddened ? It is thus that we are to imagine the musings of the poor invalid with himself in that breakdown of his health which had befallen him in October,1892 THE STORY OF GIF FORD 599' 1819, and kept him much within doors through the subsequent winter-months. There were indeed, as was the nature of his disease,, flickerings of hope and of revived energy, when he would go about again a little, resume his letter-writing, or even set himself to new poetic tasks. To this time belong an attempted recast of his Hyperion into a new form and the beginning of a satirical fairy-poem under the title of Ca-p and Bells. In these attempts themselves^ however, there seemed to be evidence of decaying powers. In January, 1820, Keats's brother Greorge was over from America on a brief visit of business; and he had hardly taken his departure again when, late at night on the 3rd of February, Keats, who had been chilled that day by unusual exposure out of doors, was seized, in Brown's, presence, by his first attack of haemorrhage from the lungs. ' That is my death-warrant,' he said to Brown, after having examined the tell tale blood-stain from his mouth. And so it proved, though not immediately. After a week or two of prostration and extreme weakness, he rallied so far as to be able to go out again pretty freely, and even let himself be half persuaded by his medical attendant that he had augured too hastily from the alarming symptom, and that his- malady might not be consumption after all. So things went on for a month or two, his doctor still misconstruing the case so confidently as even to advise his accompanying Brown in another walking-tour in Scotland, to begin in May. Feeling that to be beyond his strength, he contented himself, when the time came, with seeing Brown off by going down the river some way with him in the sailing-vessel that was to take him to Scotland,—Brown, who would have thrown his projected walking-tour or anything else to the winds rather than part with Keats had he seen the necessity of remaining, little imagining that this was their final farewell. Meanwhile, the negotia tions of Brown with the theatre-managers for the production of Keats's tragedy of Otho the Great, though promising at first, had come to nothing, and the occupation in which he had left Keats in his apparently convalescent state was the comparatively light one of revising and seeing through the press such of his poems, written during the last two years, as appeared suitable for publication. For the completion of this task he had judged it best to remove from Brown's house at Hampstead and the too close vicinity of Fanny Brawne to a lodging in Kentish Town, conveniently near to Leigh Hunt, who was then residing with his family in Mortimer Terrace- in that suburb. Here, through part of May and June, he was engaged with his proof sheets, still very recluse and weak, but with the recreation of a drive to Hampstead, or even into town, when the weather permitted. In the last week of June there were two more attacks of haemorrhage, reducing him so greatly that the Hunts insisted on taking him into their own house to be nursed. He was here, wretched and utterly broken down by his relapse, but trying to600 THE NINETEENTH April underrate its importance in his continued notes and letters to Fanny Brawne, when, early in July, 1820, ' the immortal volume,' as Mr. Sidney Colvin well calls it, appeared. St. Agnes, and other Poems. By J was the title of the volume; which included, however, also the to a Nightingale, the Ode on a Greci the the stanzas To Autumn, the fragment of and some other pieces. The reception of this, Keats's third literary venture, made amends for that of his Endymion nearly two years before. The volume was reviewed with all the cordiality of admiring friendship by Leigh Hunt; there were other kindly notices of it by the London press ; but most important of all was the article in the which it drew from the dreaded and prim-principled, but really sensitive and generous-hearted, Jeffrey. It was 'published in the number of the Revieiv for August, 1820, and is worth some attention now. Jeffrey had doubtless read the attacks on Keats in and the Quarterly two years before, and may have been predisposed by his political antagonism to those rival organs of public opinion to look into the abused poem for himself, and, if he found sufficient reason, ^employ a few pages of the Edinburgh in giving the young man a much-needed ' lift.' This, and the fact that the result of Jeffrey's examination had been not satisfaction merely, but an enthusiasm of admiration surprising to himself, the tone and language of the article,— which goes back upon the Endymion before proceeding to the new volume, and indeed professes to be a review of the former volume and the new one together,—make abundantly plain. We had never happened [Jeffrey begins] to see either of these volumes till very lately, and have been exceedingly struck with the genius they display, and the spirit of poetry which breathes through all their extravagance. That imitation of our old writers, and especially of our elder dramatists, to which we cannot help flattering ourselves that we have somewhat contributed, has brought on, as it were, second spring in our poetry; and few of its blossoms are either more profuse of sweetness or richer in promise than this which is now before us. Mr. Keats, we -understand, is still a very young man ; and his whole works, indeed, bear evidence enough of the fact. They are full of extravagance and irregularity, rash attempts at originality, interminable wanderings, and excessive obscurity. They manifestly re quire, therefore, all the indulgence that can be claimed for a first attempt. But we think it no less plain that they deserve it, for they are flushed all over with the rich lights of fancy, and so coloured and bestrewn with the flowers of poetry that, •even while perplexed and bewildered in their labyrinths, it is impossible to resist the intoxication of their sweetness, or to shut our hearts to the enchantments which they so lavishly present. Jeffrey then goes on, after the very mechanical method which was usual with him in his reviews,—the alternate 'beauty and blemish' method, as it maybe called,—to give his judgment of some of Keats's productions individually. The blame is still plentiful enough, but as1892 THE STORY OF GIFF 601 if lie forced himself to it to keep up appearances; and the praise splendidly predominates. Thus, of the after specifying all that might be said against it on account of its irrationality, the sensation one has in it of moving through an endless entanglement of woody and flowery intricacies, the dependence of the sense on the rhymes, and what not, and after admitting that ' there is no work, accordingly, from which a malicious critic could cull more matter for ridicule,' he adds bravely : ' But we do not take that to be office,, and must beg leave, on the contrary, to say that anyone who, on this account, would represent the poem as despicable, must either have no notion of poetry or no regard to truth.' Gifford and Lockhart might take that home to themselves, if they chose, he seems to say ; but he would even generalise the observation for them. ' We are very much inclined, indeed, to add,'writes Jeffrey, in what is perhaps the most remarkable sentence in the whole article,—' We are very much inclined to add that we do not know any book which we would sooner employ as a test to ascertain whether anyone had in him a native relish for poetry, and a genuine sensibility to its intrinsic charm.' Such is Jeffrey's liking for the that he cannot yet leave it, but devotes several pages more to comments on it and quota tions from it, so that he has little space remaining for the contents of the new volume. But on these also he is highly appreciative. After hastily noticing the L&amp;imioi, and quoting some stanzas from the Isabella to illustrate its ' deep pathos,'he quotes a portion of the to a Nightingale as £ equally distinguished for harmony and high poetic feeling,' declares that he knew nothing ' at once so truly fresh,, genuine, and English, and at the same time so full of poetical feeling and Grreek elegance and simplicity,' as the address and falls in love most particularly with finding ' glory and charm' in that poem, ' gorgeous distinctness,' and ' a pervading grace and purity that indicate not less clearly the exaltation than the refinement of the author's fancy.' The fragment was beyond Jeffrey's grasp; and, though he acknowledges that there are in it ' passages of some force and grandeur,' he likes it least of all, and cannot, he says, advise its completion. Altogether, the article,, coming from the powerful critic whose persecution of Wordsworth had been so notoriously relentless, was astonishingly encomiastic, and was calculated to rehabilitate at once, as Jeffrey no doubt intended, the reputation which Blackwood and the had done their best to shatter. Whether Keats ever saw the article seems uncertain. When it appeared, in August, 1820, he was past caring much for reviews, favourable or unfavourable. He had been growing weaker and weaker every day, and was under medical orders to leave England as soon as possible for a residence in Italy through the coming winter. On the 12th of August, unwilling any longer to tax the hospitality of the602 THE NINETEENTH April Hunts ill Kentish Town, tie went back to Hampstead—not now into his old quarters there, but, as was natural, to be in the charge of Mrs. Brawne till he should go abroad. The painter Haydon, who visited him once in Mrs. Brawne's house, says he found him there ' lying on a white bed, with white quilt and white sheets, the only colour visible being the hectic flush of his cheeks.' Shelley, on hearing of the probability of his wintering in Italy, had written inviting him warmly to be his guest at Pisa; but, Kome having been thought preferable, the invitation was evaded. His bosom friend. Brown, whom letters sent to Scotland had failed to reach till after some time, hurried back, on receipt of them at last, to be Keats's travelling companion, but arrived too late. The pious office, however, had been undertaken by the young artist, Joseph Severn, whose ardent admiration of Keats led him to throw aside his art-engagements and art-prospects in London, as of no consequence in competition with so sacred a duty. It was on the 18th of September that they embarked in the Thames; a, tedious voyage of four weeks brought them to Naples in October; there was some detention there by quarantine and other causes; a renewed invitation received there from Shelley, still urging them to come to Pisa, was again declined; and about the middle of November they were in Eome. The records of Keats's sufferings and of the state of his mind during his journey are inexpressibly painful. He was clinging to life, lighting with death; and Fanny Brawne was continually in his thoughts. ' I can bear to die,—I cannot bear to leave her,' he had written to Brown from Naples on the 1st of November; and the letter ends with these words :— My dear Brown, for my sake, be lier advocate for ever. I cannot say a word about Naples ; I do not feel at all concerned in tlie thousand novelties around me. I am afraid to write to her; I should like ber to know tbat I do not forget ber. Ob ! Brown, I bave coals of fire in my breast: it surprises me tbat tbe buman heart is capable of containing and bearing so mucb misery. Was I born for tbis -end ? God bless ber, and ber mother, and my sister, and George, and bis wife, andjyou, and all! It was little different in Eome. For a while, indeed, he was able to stroll about in the streets near the lodging that had been taken for Mm by his medical attendant, Dr. Clark, afterwards known as Sir James Clark; and, the opinion of his case by this eminent physician having been more favourable at first than had been expected, his spirits rose considerably, something of his old playfulness returned, and the sights and social incidents of the famous city had some interest for him. From about the 10th of December, however, when haemorrhage after haemorrhage removed all hope, and reduced him to the condition of a bedfast and dying invalid, his restlessness and irritability were at times so great as to make Severn's charge of him a most trying task. He lingered on till the 23rd of February, 1821;1892 THE STORY OF GIF FORD 603 on which day, a calmer and gentler frame of mind having come at last, he died peacefully in Severn's arms. He was buried three days afterwards in the lonely Protestant cemetery near the pyramid of Cestius, where his ashes still rest, and where visitors now see also the grave of the faithful Severn, whose honoured life was protracted fifty-eight years beyond that of the friend with whose memory his name is imperishably associated. Keats at the time of his death was twenty-five years and four months old. It was two years and five months after the article on him in the ; and, knowing now how much Keats had been doing in the interval, and what a succession of incidents affecting him had intervened between the two events, we can judge how little the one can have had to do with the other. Although, however, the legend as to the cause of the premature death of Keats has thus to be dismissed as an impassioned hallucination of Shelley's, perpetuated by Byron's epigrammatic version of it, those two articles on Keats's Endymion on its first appearance,—the wood article of August, 1818, and the Quarterly article of September, 1818,—retain an infamous kind of interest in English literary history, and cannot be allowed to be forgotten. The recollection of them suggests various reflections. They exemplify for us, in the first place, the horrible iniquity, the utter detestability, of the prac tice of carrying the rancour of party politics into the business of literary criticism. Almost avowedly, it was because young Keats was a friend of Leigh Hunt, and was supposed to share the political opinions of Hunt and a few other Londoners of prominent political notoriety at the time, that the two periodicals in question made their simul taneous onslaught on Endymion. They had vowed exterminating war against Hunt and his political associates, and were lying in wait for every new appearance in the field of a straggler from that camp; and what did it matter to them who emerged next, or in what guise ? Keats had emerged,—in reality no party politician at all, but in every fibre of his nature a poet and that only,—Keats had emerged ; and they bludgeoned him ! It is to be hoped that in the literary critic ism of our day there are, and can be, no such outrages ; but I would not be too sure. If there is any advice which one might be permitted to give, to young men especially, in connection with the story I have been resuscitating, it is that they should abhor the intrusion of party- politics into higher and finer concerns, and make it their endeavour all their lives, in their own minds and conduct, to keep the spirit of party-politics within bounds. But the recollection of those two reviews of Keats's Endymion, especially when we remember also how many other instances there are of the kind, may well prompt a still more extensive reflection. They remind us of the necessary fallibility of literary criticism, even when it may not be vitiated in the mannerTHE NINETEENTH April just specified. In thinking of them and of analogous cases, we are almost driven into the adoption of Goethe s dictum as to the futility and inexpediency of the habit of controversy and fault-finding on any occasion whatsoever. The end of all opposition is negation [said Goethe], and negation is nothing If I call bad bad, what do I gain ? but, if I call good bad, I do a great deal of mis chief. He who will work aright must never rail, must never trouble himself at all about what is ill done, but always do the best he can himself. Excellent as this maxim of Goethe's is essentially, I am afraid it cannot be made absolute practically. There always will be, and always must be, criticism in the world; and, though it is perhaps the best function of criticism to discern what is good and proclaim it to be good, especially where a misguided public are calling it bad, it is a proper and useful function also to detect and denounce what is bad, especially when a misguided public are applauding and running after it as good. The purification of criticism, therefore, rather than its abolition, is what has to be striven for. Now, the first requisite in literary criticism is honesty— i.e. the determination always to say of a book what the critic really thinks and feels about it, and nothing that he does not really think and feel. But mere honesty is not enough. The Quarterly Reviewer, I believe, was honest enough, after a rough fashion, when he said he could make neither head nor tail of Endymion ; and, though I am not so sure of Lockhart (if Lockhart was the other culprit), and think that in his case condonation requires recollection of the signal importance of his later services to literature, yet Lockhart too may have really felt some of those objections to the poem which he employed for its public derision. Besides honesty, and a general willingness to approach a book sympathetically, rather than with a face already made up to snap and snarl, there is required in certain cases a peculiar pre-established capability, in the foim of such a power of sudden self-enlargement, sudden self-relaxation from old prepossessions, as will enable one to appreciate with immediate enthusiasm any superlatively excellent production of a new and un common species. This qualification is rare, and we must not be too severe on the want of it. If a Jeffrey, with all his acuteness of per ception, all his sensibility to certain kinds of the beautiful, and all his real generosity of temper, was so wrapped up in a set of narrow inherited prepossessions respecting what he called 'the laws of poetry' as to be incapable of receiving the successive productions of Words worth's genius otherwise than with discomposure and a rage of protest, how could a rhinoceros like Gifford have been expected to behave when what was hung in front of him for investigation and report was such an unprecedented invention of sheer phantasy and lusciousness as Keats's Endymion? But time brings about the due rectifications. 4 The world is really served only by the is another1892 THE STORY OF GIFF 605 •of the aphorisms of the wise Goethe; and the world, in a blind and stumbling way, becomes itself aware of that fact. Every new instance of the nobly or the finely extraordinary in any department insinuates its own influence gradually into the general mind, modifying the previous standard of judgment in that department, and changing the demands and expectations in it for the future. Thus, in the case of Xeats, just as in that of Wordsworth, a conspicuously blundering critical judgment at first has been as conspicuously condemned and reversed. It is Keats's Hyperion, with his and his other later poems of the volume of 1820, that people now almost unanimously agree to regard as the most perfect and splendid things Jie has left us; but the much-decried of 1818, with all its admitted faults, now counts enormously also in the reckoning with those who know it best; and the earlier volume of 1817 yields some deathless additions. And so it has happened that, in virtue of those bequests to our poetry, not of large bulk altogether, from four years ■of too short a life, this youth of exquisitely peculiar genius, on whom the robust Gfifford or his deputy trampled so savagely because he could not understand him, has been promoted to a zone in the invisible firmament of the departed immeasurably above that tenanted by the robust Gifford and all his kin, and that now, as Shelley has expressed it in his elegy, The soul of Adonais, like a star, Beacons from the aboie where the eternals are. D avid M assox, V ol. XXXI - X o. 182606 THE NINETEENTH April THE ATTACK ON THE CREDIT OF To gauge the material and social condition of any country with accuracy is a matter involving mginy difficulties, even to those who are skilled in making such estimates. There are so many matters involved, that only those who are well provided with statistical data can hope to arrive at any conclusion which would approach to a truth ful generalisation of a complex and many-sided subject. But even to the statistician or economist who may be well equipped for such a task there are dangers and difficulties of a formidable character where there are tendencies or influences towards a favoured precon ception. For as Mr. G-oschen has so] well remarked, ' the adminis trator of statistics is like a showman who is exhibiting certain figures— according as he throws light or shade upon the pictures which he exhibits, he-can produce true or false impressions. Whole rows of figures he may throw into impenetrable shade, while others are at the same time brought into excessive prominence, and thus to the eye of the spectator much may be rendered invisible, and much may be distorted by exaggerated lights, which turn facts into caricatures'; and therefore, he proceeds to say, 4 given a great number of figures partially unknown, given unlimited power and discretion of selection, and given an enthusiast determined to prove his case, and I will not answer for the consequences.' In matters which directly concern the value of any country's credit or commercial undertakings, there is a still more dangerous source for the creation of distorted or exaggerated pictures of the truth. Here, too, skill of a sort is required to produce an illusory picture. But under such circumstances the object of the manipulator or showman, however skilfully veiled, is intentionally to produce illusion in the mind of the spectator. The ostensible reason given may be enthusiasm for truth, or a desire to protect the helpless public investor; but the hidden and real motive is to produce such an immediate impression upon the public mind as will favour the selfish interests of some section of that powerful class of speculators who have been well though severely described by Schaeffle as that' Whole unclean brigand aristocracy of the Bourse.' The debt of Australasia, now amounting to 183,469,612?., is too 1 Forwarded by the Premier of Tasmania.1892 THE CREDIT OF 607 important to escape the attention of manipulators of the class referred to, and it is not surprising that distorted pictures regarding the credit of Australasia should be skilfully prepared from time to time, to influence the public mind when the circumstances are favourable for such modes of attack. It is not the object of this article to attempt the refutation of any one of the many published misstate ments of persons of this class, because their effect is necessarily transient; and because they are necessarily accompanied by strong lights upon the brighter side; and thus the alternating bright and seamy-side views, in a manner, correct themselves, while they produce in some measure the effect contemplated by the interested showman. It is a different thing, however, when an attack finds a place in the pages of a first class Keview such as the ; 2 at a time, too, when such an attack is most likely to inflict much damage upon the credit of Australasia. It is true that Mr. Fortescue at the outset admits that he is drawing a partial picture—and that, too, wholly drawn from what appears to him to be the ' seamy side'; but in the course of his remarks, and especially in his conclusions, he seems to forget entirely that he is dealing with a partial view of the question, and thus, exhibiting the worst faults of the statistical enthusiast bent upon proving his case, he tends to produce a false impression by the wilful manner in which he persists in throwing the brighter side into impenetrable shade, while upon the so-called seamy side the distor tion caused by ' exaggerated light' ' turns facts into caricatures.' Scope of the Functions of General Government of Australasian Colonies contrasted with those of the United Kingdom. The fundamental error in Mr. Fortescue's argument bearing upon Australasian indebtedness is his entire failure to appreciate the scope of the functions of the general government of the various colonies as contrasted with those of the United Kingdom, and to discern the important distinction between debts incurred for purposes of protec tion or aggressive warfare, and invest (also bearing the name of public debt) incurred and expended in improving and enhancing the value of the public estate by means of railways, roads, and harbours. In the self-governing colonies of Australasia, the scope of general government—owing to the peculiar condition of lands thinly populated with vast undeveloped areas—embraces many functions which it would be impossible to resign to local bodies or to private enterprise as in older countries. Hence it has been found necessary to embrace such public works as among the most important functions of the of the country. Unless this fundamental distinction of the scope of the general government in old and new countries be thoroughly con- 2 Nineteenth Century April, 1891. t t 2608 THE NINETEENTH April sidered and allowed for, all comparisons relating to the proportion and cost of public services and public debt between countries so differently conditioned would be worse tlian useless. In Australasia the greater proportion of the cost of general government ( — 66'41 per cent., 1890) is for services of distribution or communication, such as railways, roads, bridges, harbours, post and telegraphs, and the extent to which these enter into the question depends upon rather than population. In the United Kingdom—the greater part of these services (exceeding the total cost of general government of the United Kingdom by more than 64 per cent.) is left to private enterprise or to local government. This is best appreciated by con trasting the proportion of expenditure incurred under the general functions of government in respect of special public works and services in Australasia and the United Kingdom as in the accompanying com parative tables, I., II., and III.

It is obvious, too, that, with the most trivial exceptions, the latter country is in no way directly con cerned with capital invested in railways, roads, bridges, harbours, water-supply, and other public works, which directly enhance the value of the public estate; and that its debt is almost wholly un represented by works or undertakings which produce wealth in a com mercial sense, and can only be regarded as the cost of past services dissipated in foreign wars, either for the protection or advancement of the general interests or prestige of the empire. So far as the financier is concerned, it can neither be regarded as a commeicial asset nor as the index of an asset which can be reduced to a coire sponding value. It is merely a premium paid for protection and nothing more. In the colonies, on the other hand, the major part of the so- called public debt is as much a commercial asset as the capital in vested in railways and tramways in England, and with the exception of about one or two per cent, the remainder is represented by public works of a permanent character, whose value, as wealth-producing auxiliaries, enormously exceeds the nominal debt standing against them. It is necessary at the outset to mark these important distinctions before replying to the specific charges against the financial soundness of the colonies brought forward by Mr. 'Fortescue; for in his adverse conclusions he has widely erred owing to rather than to misstatement of certain facts and figures. The financial stability of these colonies is questioned by him, especially upon the following grounds : 1. The heaviness of the existing public debt. 2^ That the debt is increasing at a greatei ratio than eitner the population or revenue. 3. (a)That the railways are unproductive or do not pay the whole of the interest of the capital expended on their construction ; (6) and, further, that as the urban populations are increasing at a greater ratio than the rural populations, it is inferred the railways612 THE NINETEENTH April ' are not accomplisliing mucli towards the end for which they were constructed.' 4. That taxation steadily increases; and ' although but 36 per cent, of the revenue is raised by taxation in Australia against 84 per cent, in England, taxation per head is higher in the former than im the latter.' 5. That State socialism is rampant in the Australian colonies and that their financial stability, therefore, is insecure. These frve charges form the whole text of Mr. Fortescue's picture of what he calls ' The Seamy Side of Australia.' To the careless or unskilled they may appear formidable, but if they be examined thoroughly it will be discovered either that the which Mr. J ortescue draws from some of the data are superficial, and altogether the reverse of the truth, or that the themselves are misleading or inaccurately stated. The reasons which justify this view of the case are best appreciated by examining each charge- separately. (1) The heaviness of the existing Fortescue- makes much of the effect produced upon the mind by the phrase- heavily in debt,' as applied to the nominal public debt of Australia. If he means to affirm that it is heavy because it is absolutely large- in amount, the statement is unsatisfactory; for if the 189,000,000L of Austrahan indebtedness (general and local government), 95 per cent. at least of which is represented by railways, tramways, and other public works, which enormously enhance the value of the public- and private estate, be deemed excessive, what shall we say of the capital of the United Kingdom, amounting to 1,825,000,000^. in 1889, sunk m its public debt (general and local) and in its railways, and of the whole of which only 62 per cent., or thereabouts, can be said to be represented by public works or undertakings, which, in a com mercial sense, are either reproductive or calculated to enhance the value of its public or private estate ? It is altogether misleading to ignore the fact that the 121,000,000^. of capital invested in railways m Australasia by the Governments is just as much, or as little, of the- nature of a true public debt as the 890,000,000^. so invested bv private companies in the United Kingdom. But Mr. I ortescue no doubt would urge that the 189 000 000^ of Australasia and the 1,825,000,000^. of the United Kingdom are not comparable taken absolutely; that, in fact, the greatness of a debt: is relative to the power or wealth of the debtor to discharge the obli gation connected therewith. Had Mr. Fortescue stated this matter more explicitly in his first charge it would not have favoured his: jeremiad; bnt setting this aside, let us endeavour to see whether, in he relative method, he has any better support. This may be arrived at approximately by showing what proportion the respective debts or investments bear either to private wealth or to population.

Why this : that in relation to absolute indebtedness, or in relation to private wealth or to population, Australasia's financial condition is greatly superior to^ that of the wealthiest country of Europe at the present moment; while, as regards the future, its potential resources and capacity for expansion are immeasurably greater ; and if, on the score of in debtedness, Australasian finances are still deemed to be insecure,, then, by a similar process of reasoning, the financial condition of the richest country of Europe can be proved to be hopelessly bankrupt! (2) Debt increasing at a greater or revenue. —That, up to the present, the nominal debt has increased at a greater ratio than either revenue or population, is a fact which no one seeks to deny \ that it is objectionable and a menace to the financial stability of Australasia, as indicated by Mr. Fortescue, is quite a different matter. Mr. Fortescue again falls into the error of confounding the public debt of Australasia with that of the United Kingdom. He forgets- that the former capital is invested in powerful auxiliaries aiding pro ducing industries in the more rapid creation of wealth, while the latter—where alone his argument could have force—is mainly due to the waste of war; and, instead of being an aid to those engaged in the production of wealth, forms an obstacle or tax upon its creative industries. It does not require much knowledge of industrial economy to realise the fact that the wealth of any country is greatly multiplied by the introduction of machinery which facilitates the creation of products or diminishes the cost of production or transport. Thi&amp; result is quite independent of the accidental circumstance as to how614 THE NINETEENTH April much public revenue may be necessary to carry on tlie macldnery of government; and is also independent of questions relating to the stationariness or rapidity of increase of population as regards any parallelism between their respective ratios of increase. Indeed, it would be a gloomy look-out for any country if the ratio of increase of capital investments in wealth-producing machinery did not greatly exceed the ratio of increase of its population or its public revenue. All the hopes of economists for the amelioration and improvement of the material condition of a people depend upon such agencies increasing at a greater ratio than people or public revenue. Now, as the Governments of Australasia hold the position of capitalist and entTepTeneuT,in respect of the great industries connected with trans port and communication, it follows that they constitute in themselves the most important employers of labour in the community and if they fail to make the necessary provision for bringing improved means of transport to settlers in the freshly invaded areas of land, they arrest the production of wealth and the further development of the country. If such provision be made only according to the ratio of increase of population or public revenue, no positive advance could occur. As a matter of fact no country, in the earlier stages of its history, can ever prosper whose capital investments in the machinery of transport and production do not in ratio of increase greatly exceed the ratio of increase of either people or public revenue. And yet Mr. Fortescue bases one of his objections upon the fact that Australasia is doing that which is most necessary for its progress and prosperity, i.e. her debts invested in railways and tramways are increasing at a greater ratio than either her people or public revenue. To make further evident the fallacy of his conclusions in this respect, it can be shown by reference to all countries that the capital invested in railway construction—the major item in Australian indebtedness— has ever advanced at a much higher ratio than either population or public revenue, and more especially so at the earlier stages of railway development. That railway construction has in all countries made prodigious progress since the year in which the first railway was opened in England (September 27,1825) is proverbial. That such construction in various countries has progressed remarkably, and at an enormously higher ratio than the public revenue and population, is unmistakably indicated by the following comparative statements. Nothing could more clearly reveal the fallacy of Mr. Fortescue's argument than the illustrations given in these tables, proving that, of necessity, in the earlier and even in the later stages, railway construc tion and investment have progressed in all countries, as well as in Australasia, at an enormously higher ratio than either general revenue or population; and, so far is this from being taken as an objection, it has been regarded by the ablest minds as the chief cause of the great increase of wealth and progress in modern times.616 THE NINETEENTH CEN April This reasoning is obviously faulty. To the country, as a whole, or to its produeing industries or con sumers, the whole of the freight charges of a railway, regarded as an item of revenue-even although covering working expenses and interest on capital-form the merest flea-bite as regaids the actua value added to the country's wealth. The principal additions to the wealth of the country due to ra ways are derived as follows : # . . n) By the saving of time and cost of transit. (2) By giving commercial valne to vast natural products hitherto lacking value, owing to lack of cheap means of transit. (3) By the impetus given to e creation of fresh wealth in areas formerly unproductive. ^ These three considerations, which, fairly indicate the rea commercial advantages of railway communication to a country, strange to say, are ignored by Mr. Fortescue when contemplating ' the end' for which railways have been introduced, for the develop ment of the vast regions of virgin lands in Australasia. ^ It is evident, therefore, from an economist's point of view, that Mr. Fortescue has signally failed to observe those factors of the problem upon which a truthful conclusion depends, and not suipris ing that a more complete investigation of the question should prove his conclusions to be widely erroneous. To estimate the ' Wealth of Exchange' added to the country by the agency of railways would, indeed, be a difficult matter. We may know this added wealth to be very great in itself, but we have no means of ascertaining its value quantitatively. Items 2 and 3 above referred to can only be vaguely guessed at. But the wealth and other advantages gained by saving time and labour through the improvement in means of transport can be very closely approxi mated. • • i The gain from this cause, although, of necessity, not seen m the receipts of the railway, regarded as an undertaking, becomes at once apparent when we try to realise the difference in cost of transport aa between the railways now in operation and the more imperfect means in use prior to their introduction. In new countries good roads are only to be rarely found, and only in proximity to ports or con suming centres. The expenditure of time and labour in effecting the necessary transport between points of production and centres of population or ports of trade was therefore very great. Even in the few districts where good macadamised roads existed, the cost of transit formed a heavy tax upon either the producer or consumer, as such, or upon both, accordingly as the product was intended for foreign or local consumption. The following shows the reduction in fares and freights caused by the introduction of railways in Tasmania since the year 1870.THE CREDIT OF AUSTRA 617 — Present Railway Pares and Freight (1889) , Carriers' Preight and Pares(1870) Reduction Per cent.

It will suffice, however, to gauge the immense value which the saving in cost of transit by railways represents to the colonies as a whole, if we take the latter at a reduction of 66*66 per cent., or two-thirds of the ratio of former cost. The following account, for the seven colonies, for the year 1890 shows the net advantage to the country effected by railway communication after discharging all expenses connected with maintenance and working, and capital borrowed towards construction (107,712,644/!.).

At 4 per cent, thisthe nineteenth April represents a clear gain of capital wealth to tlie extent of 425,000,000^ notwithstanding that the net receipts in this year only contributed 3,176,096L or 71 '43 per cent, of the interest on capital. It must be borne in mind also that this estimate does not include any portion of the great though unascertainable proportion of wealth which has been added to the country by the facilities which railways afford in opening up virgin lands to cultivation, and in utilising natural products which, without railways, would be unproductive. Moreover, although during the last seven years the average net receipts from railways only contributed 74-34 per cent, of the interest charge, it must not be forgotten that, in that time, railway construc tion has increased 75-60 per cent. In England, where the population is very dense, it is estimated by good authorities that it takes seven years for a line to develop a profitable traffic in the sense m which profit is regarded by the railway shareholder. Surely , in the almost virgin districts of Australasia, this margin should be extended. But even if we only allow seven years for railways extended into new districts, it follows that a development to the extent of 75-60 per cent, in seven years would have the effect of concealing what the true profits are on the older lines, and what the later lines may yield after a proper period of development. Thus, in the year 1889, of the 16,827 miles open for traffic, only 57 per cent, were open for seven years and upwards, and 43 per cent, for varying numbers of years below seven. It is estimated that in a new country, a mean return of about 1-5 per cent, would accrue as interest on the capital invested in respect of the latter. It is required, therefore, to show what return has been yielded by the older lines. This is shown as follows : — Capital Invested Proportion of Net Receipts Proportion of Net Eeceipts to Capital Lines seven years old (67 per cent.) Lines under seven years old') yielding on the average 1-5 J&gt; per cent, on capital . . j £55,910,000 £46,024,000 £2,450,640 £690,360 4-38 1-50 All lines £101,934,000 £3,141,000 3-08 • By this computation it is proved that the lines over seven years old, representing railways at the full stage of development, have yielded a profit of 4-38 per cent, on capital invested, and this pleasing result shows that they more than pay interest on capital invested. It may be confidently expected, therefore, that when the younger lines arrive at the same stage of development, a like profitable result will be obtained. In every sense, therefore, it has been fairly demonstrated that the railways of Australasia are most profitable investments^1892 THE CREDIT AUSTRALASIA 619 and in every way fulfil the valuable purposes for which they were intended. 3, (h) That the populations of greater ratio than the Rural Populatio —Mr. Fortescue does not seem to be satisfied with his attempts, upon financial grounds, to show that Australian railways have failed c to accomplish much towards the end for which they were constructed;' for he advances, in support of the same contention, the statement that, as the ratios of chief urban populations are now relatively higher to rural popula tions than in the year 1881, therefore (!) the railways' 'promote a marked increase in the Now, any one who has paid the slightest attention to the science of demography will at once perceive that here again Mr. Fortescue has committed himself to a series of errors. In the first place, the inference, that the rural population in Australia has failed to show a marked increase within the last decade,, is unmistakably the reverse of the truth. In the second place, it is evident that Mr. Fortescue's acquaint ance with this portion of his subject is extremely faulty; for no skilled person could pretend to draw a conclusion regarding the positive increase of a rural population from the mere reference to the altera tion of ratios between the rural and urban populations within any given period. Finally, the causes which determine the alteration in the ratios between urban and rural populations lie deeper and extend wider than even those that determine the influence which railways exert upon a community. To mistake a concomitant for a cause, as Mr. Fortescue appears to have done, is a flagrant blunder in reasoning. That the ratios of urban centres in Australasia must tend to increase faster than rural ratios is inevitable, if she is to keep pace with the front rank of. nations in modern civilisation; for her absolute progress, as well as the absolute progress of all countries, solely depends upon unlimited freedom to expand advantageously in this direction; and the extent of freedom to expand with advantage in this way, may fairly be taken as the most significant of those indices which distinguish the differing civilisations of semi-barbarous and highly enlightened communities. In the earlier stages of civilisation—when a given area of laud can only be made to yield a miserable support to a scanty population—urban centres have their ratios at a minimum. In proportion as the same area of land— by man's increasing command over natural forces—is made to yield a higher result, the comfort and number of the population correspond ingly increase. The relative increase in the ratio of the urban population is a natural consequence. To deplore, therefore, the increasing ratios of urban centres of industry, is to deplore the higher advance made in modern civilisation. The truth of these observations is well attested by reference to the followingffigures.620 THE NINETEENTH April Ratios of Urban and Rural Population varying Intervals Progress of Population Per cent.

Nor is Mr. Fortescuemore fortunate in his attempt to prove that the rural population of Australia has failed to show a marked increase daring the last decade, when her railway development has been greatest. Thus:1892 THE CREDIT 621 Trogress of Rural Population in Australasia 1881-1891, trasted with the Progress made in Periods.

That Taxation steadily increase land. —This point may be very briefly disposed of. Taxation has increased in Australia, but not to a degree that is felt to be burden- •some, nor to such an extent as to leave no margin for further imposts if required. Moreover, as the bulk of the taxation now levied is derived from Customs' duties, its extent is an index of the wealth of the community as a whole, and increases with the increased pur chasing power of the people. And the taxpayers are satisfied in that they have an equivalent for what they pay. 5. That State Socialism is rampa —The special reference to Australia as regards the occasional manifestation of the ordinary socialistic tendencies of the age, merely shows that Mr. Fortescue must have run short of suitable pigments wherewith to further bedaub the ' seamy side' picture of Australia as painted by him. No doubt it would be easy to prove that Australian politics and Australian relations between labour and capital are influenced by the forces which are now markedly affecting the politics and industrial organisations throughout the civilised world ; and in no country more so than in England. But Mr. Fortescue might far more reasonably restrict to Australasia the possible disadvantages arising from sunspct cycles, than attempt to localise therein the effects of forces and tendencies which have a universal application. Conclusion, In concluding these observations it will, I think, be conceded that, in every case, Mr. Fortescue's arguments have been fairly over thrown. It has been shown that his ' seamy side,' when properly looked into, turns out to be no ' seamy side ' at all; that Australasia's public debt is insignificant as compared with that of the United Kingdom, relatively or absolutely; and insignificant as compared with the great resources that empower her to discharge all the obligations V ol . XXXI—N o. 182 U U622 THE NINETEENTH April connected therewith; and that, in this respect, her financial stability is even more secure than that of the United Kingdom, which may still be regarded as the richest country in Europe. It has also been shown that her railways have not only accomplished the great end for which they were introduced, but that, even restricting attention to the advantages secured by cheaper modes of transit alone, Australasia, in the year 1890, showed a clear balance of gain in her favour equal to 17,000,000^ for that year alone, after allowing for interest on debt, and representing a clear capital gain of 425,000,000^. over and above the whole of the 107,000,000^. of capital invested in railways. That is, her gain in this respect alone represents at least the amount of her present public debt. It has likewise been clearly shown that Mr. Fortescue's reference to the increasing ratio of urban population in Australasia has received a most false interpretation: for, as a matter of fact, and notwithstanding the greater increase in the ratio of urban population, the rural population of Australia has, in the last decade, increased at a more rapid rate than the rural population of any other great country whose history is known ; and this statement also applies to her revenue. It has also been proved, in so far as the rate of railway development exceeds the ratios of both population and revenue, that this, in itself, is an index of increasing wealth ; and, far from being a matter to be deplored, is a feature she shares with all countries that have added to their prosperity by the introduction of railways. In marshalling the facts and figures bearing upon the several matters touched upon, it will, I hope, be conceded that every care has been taken to insure accuracy, and to avoid the snare of the statistical enthusiast, who, for the sake of gaining a barren victory, may be led to magnify or caricature his facts and figures by the agency of ' exaggerated lights.' K. M. Johnston, Statistician1892 623 i -■ ', tt | c to t; ; ive at CAMP LIFE k IN tk The sun was shining down brigMly upon us, as we left the hotel that stands outside the walls of white Tangier, and rode along the stony pathway that would take us up to the pigsticking camp, some sixteen or seventeen miles away. For fully three weeks past this pigsticking expedition had been discussed and arranged and rearranged, while for the last few days it had become a perfectly absorbing topic, to the exclusion of every thing else. Who was going? and with what horses? Were Bruzeaud's or Ansaldo's tents to be used ? What luggage would be the allowed, and what had it best consist of? These and many other small particulars became burning questions, and had been discussed veral unweariedly, backwards and forwards ; indeed, there had been so much care indecision that at one moment I foresaw the ghastly possibility of finding myself provided with a double set of tents, and having to lctor y. pay both Bruzeaud and Ansaldo. But all this had at last been uthe satisfactorily settled; as far as we were concerned, Ansaldo had undertaken us ; and we were promised to find our double tent pitched, and everything in order, on our arrival at the camp. I was riding Sultan, my own confidential and quite good-looking barb; Violet another; and on a strong mule, which we had been advised to add to our stud, in case of anything befalling our two horses, was perched Mahomed, our Moorish servant, whom I had been told I might find useful in camp life. I do not know that I did find him especially so, but still he certainly brushed our riding skirts, and removed the mud from our boots. It had been arranged, that every one should join the camp at the hour that best suited themselves. So with Violet and myself went the charming Due de Frias, of the Spanish Legation, and the head and manager of the expedition, who had undertaken to show us the road; M. Bosch, also of the Spanish Legation. Mrs. J , widow of a well-known African explorer, with a girl she was chaperoning, and two officers of the 60th Kifles stationed at Gibraltar, made up our party. The stony pathway very soon came to an end, and we were on u u 2624 THE NINETEENTH April one of the usual roads in Morocco, merely a broad track of mud, or, where not mud, a track of deep heavy earth, going up and down across the open country; now over a hill, now along a ravine, now across a stream, now over a plain: no trees anywhere to be seen, but here and there on the hillside, a brown village, with its blue-green hedge of prickly pears and aloes, its dogs that barked loudly as we passed, and strange-looking figures sitting and lying about, draped m dirty white garments or in brown hooded cloaks. Every now and then we meet a few loaded mules, or some solemn-looking camels, always with the inevitable bare-legged Arab in his brown hooded cloak or dull white draperies. The young green corn was springing up all over the country, and quantities of magnificent purple iris, striped with orange, gave a delightful bit of colour. But the horses wearily pulled their feet out of the heavy ground, and both riders and horses were slowly picking their way, striving to choose those parts of the track where sticking fast seemed less probable. Scarcely ever was there the chance of a trot, and the sun beat down hot and glaring over the treeless country. All this pointed to luncheon, and at a nice green spot we joyfully dis mounted ; the mule with the luncheon was called up, and we established ourselves for a delightful rest of an hour. When we started again, the character of the country began to change, and became more varied. We passed occasionally through straggling cork woods, and came on large lakes, along the shores of which we cantered gaily, till we came in sight of the sea; no longer the Mediterranean with the Spanish coast clearly in sight—we had left all that behind at Tangier; this was the open Atlantic, looking now calm and smooth enough. The sun was getting lower and lower—it was certainly a long ride to Isawara, and our camp. At last we came in sight of a hill crowned with tiny brown native houses and the inevitable prickly pear, over the brow of which we were told we should find our camp, and we rode in among its little white tents, just as the sun was setting. There must have been sixteen or seventeen tents of varying shapes and sizes, and there was a perfect labyrinth of tent ropes and tent pegs; all traps for the unwary, who, in a hurried moment, might wish to strike out a short cut to any particular tent: trouble was sure to follow—especially after dark. In the middle was the dining tent for Ansaldo's party, which was much too small for the number who had to dine in it—much grumbling ensued in consequence. Several of the old stagers at pigsticking had brought their own tents; some of these messed with Ansaldo, while others had brought their own cooking arrangements. Violet and I were enchanted with our little tent, which had a double covering and wings, so as to be water proof. We had heard such tales of tiny tents that you could barely stand upright in, that ours seemed, in comparison, quite a vast and1892 CAMP LIFE I 625 well-furnislied apartment. Two little trestle beds, a bright coloured rug on the ground between them, a table at the head with a candle lamp, bright-coloured Moorish blankets on the beds; at the foot of one bed, our portmanteau; at the foot of the other, our carpet bag ; outside a rickety stand, with a waterproof bag as basin, made up our tent furniture. That stand with waterproof bag I cannot call a success; it had a habit of collapsing on no sort of pretext, and delug ing the place with water; after it had done this twice, we bore the thing a bitter and permanent hatred. When we had done a little unpacking we went out into the camp again. There was a lovely crescent moon and the stars were coming out fast; a few lanterns were lit here and there. We wandered about paying visits to the other tents, watching the fresh arrivals, seeing that our horses were properly looked after, pitying them for being hobbled—pitying them more, probably, than they pitied themselves, as they took to it very quietly and as to the manner born: no doubt it reminded them of olden days before they belonged to these fair-skinned people from the north. Then at seven o'clock came dinner, fifteen of us sitting down at a long table in the narrow dining tent; a polyglot assemblage of hungry people: America, England, France, Spain, Austria, and Switzerland all represented. There were the Due de Frias and M. Bosch, of the Spanish Legation; M. Seigue, of the French; Baron Pereira, of the Austrian ; two American ladies, a Swiss baron and two ladies, and six English people; truly they made the veriest Babel! After dinner we gathered round the big camp fire and were joined by those from the other tents, making up our numbers to twenty-four, twelve being ladies ! Every now and then the flames burst out afresh with a blaze and a roar; the ladies sat around toasting them selves, the men came and went with cups of coffee in the glow, every one talking and arranging for the next day ; and there were wonder ful tales of former hunts, of charging boars, of wounded men or horses, and of hairbreadth escapes. By degrees the company round the fire- grew fewer and fewer: one by one they said ' Good night,' and disappeared out of the firelight into the darkness ; lanterns were moving about the camp, the tents were lighting up; and we, too, judged it best to remember our early rise and to try how we liked our tent beds. With the lamp lighted, our tent looked almost cosy ; it felt rather like a cabin on board ship, only with no terrible screw thumping away incessantly and with no dread of waking to find a rough sea on. Among other evils we had been warned of, was the cold in a tent, but I cannot say we suffered from it; perhaps we were too well provided with rugs, or perhaps it was our hot-water bottles, which were simply invaluable. So we crept into our narrow little beds, really not at all bad ones, and lay comfortably talking to each other and listening to the wind in the trees, to the distant sea, and626 THE NINETEENTH CEN April to all the unaccustomed noises of the camp. By degrees silence fell more and more; only the dogs kept up their snarling and barking, and the curious guttural talk of the Moors seemed never to cease. It was all very odd and weird, and there was a delightful feeling of airiness without being cold; presently our remarks grew fewer and fewer, and soon we too were asleep. At 6.30 we woke with a start, a dim light was in the tent, and a voice outside asked if we were awake, and promised to send us hot water. Dressing in a narrow space with none of one's usual comforts is never an exhilarating process, and I don't know that it was pleasanter in our tent than elsewhere • still we got through with it, and were ready for breakfast at a quarter to eight, while the start for pig sticking was to be at 8.30. Then came the preparations and stir at starting, everyone looking to their girths and saddles, the men hunt ing for their spears, the ladies looking for chairs or big stones to mount by; and then in good time we were off. The ladies, and three of the men not hunting that day, were stationed near the top of a hill, overlooking the ground to be beaten; five hunters went with the beaters, and four (in case the boars broke back) were placed in pairs at the foot of the hill on which we were. We could see the whole hunt beautifully. We had dismounted, and our horses were led round the hill out of sight, and we ourselves were told to hide away among the bushes as much as possible. We could see the long line of beaters forcing their way through the bushes, and could hear their wild cries; every now and then there was a puff of smoke, followed by a sharp report—this meant that a pig had been sighted ; but no pig broke back, so that our four hunters stationed below perforce remained as idle as ourselves. At last a pig did break cover. A black object came out of the wood and adventured itself on the sandy swamp below: great excitement among us on the brow of the hill, especially as the hunters below evidently did not see the animal. But the pig did not appear to like the look of the swamp, as presently it turned itself round and toddled gently back into the wood. Another long wait: the clouds were gathering and over the sea it looked terribly disagreeable and threatening. But now, again, a black object appeared below, and this time it kept steadily on across the sand, evidently making for our hills; this time, too, the horsemen below saw it, and prepared themselves to give chase ; two of them getting lower down, ready to start across the sand, when the boar should be near enough for them to show themselves. Steadily the boar came on and was now halfway across; then the two horsemen, lance in hand, spurred on to meet it as fast as might be across the sand ; the animal saw them and turned—it was a race now as to which should reach the wood first; the sand seemed heavy and the horses laboured, but they gained on the pig. Now one was up with it, and the pig turned ; the second horse reared and plunged—it would not1892 CAMP LIFE I G27 face tlie beast; and then, for a few minutes, there was a wild skurry- ing backwards and forwards; the pig charging at the horses, and the horses backing and plunging, and then again pursuing. And then presently it was all over, and a black object lay still on the sands; and the rain that had been threatening for the last hour came down in perfect sheets. There was nothing for it but to get back to the camp; there would assuredly be no more pigsticking that day unless the weather changed. The horses were brought up, mackintoshes and umbrellas produced, and a bedraggled and damp company started back for the tents. To speak of personal experience, my mackintosh was a delusion; it was of a shape invented by myself for the occasion, by way of keeping my skirt dry, and it entirely declined to do any thing of the kind. The flap intended for that purpose waved gaily in the wind, leaving my skirt to get drenched through and through, while it undertook to blow about and scare my horse with its playful vagaries. I was reduced to holding it quiet with one hand, which was also struggling with an umbrella, while with the other I tried to guide my horse over the rough stony ground and through the bushes and undergrowth—altogether sadly uncomfortable and incon venient. What with wind, rain, umbrella, mackintosh, and wet reins, I was heartily glad when I bumped slowly at a heavy trot into the camp. And now the next few hours, I must allow, had their drawbacks. It rained hard and steadily, only occasionally varying the monotony by coming down in a solid sheet; the camp became a swamp, and the move from one tent to another anything but pleasant. We gathered together in the dining tent, and had luncheon. By degrees the other men arrived, who had been in the detachment with the beaters; they, too, wanted luncheon, and we heard how two pigs had been killed by them, and who had got the first spear, and who the second ; and from that we got to other pigsticking expeditions, and then to other subjects, and so the afternoon wore on. And towards sunset the sky cleared up in a half-hearted kind of way; glimpses of sunshine, and a rainbow, and a golden, though watery-looking, sun set. Then we paddled out to look after the horses ; fed them with bread and sugar, got the Moors to wipe the wet from their heads and ears ; unhobbled my dear Sultan and had him led off for a walk. Then we looked in on our neighbours; heard into whose tents the rain had made its way; found a fire on which cooking was going on, and rushed off to fetch some of the wettest and most essential of our wet garments, to see if we could dry them. And so the sunset faded away and night came on, with all the usual difficulties of avoiding ropes and pegs, to which were now added mud and puddles. Then there was dinner, and, joy of joys, the rain still kept off, and we were able to have our camp fire and rejoice in a thorough toast: it seemed to me I had never really enjoyed a fire before. All through that628 THE NINETEENTH April night we could hear, at intervals, heavy showers of rain beating down on our tent, and felt sadly anxious about the weather for next day - but at 6.30, when the camp began to bestir itself, although the day looked doubtful, no rain was falling ; and by breakfast time we began to hope the weather would hold up. It looked still so unsettled, though, that six of the ladies and several men decided to return to Tangier ; the rest of us made up our minds to stay another night. By nine o'clock, when we were all in the saddle ready for the start, the day had cleared up and the sun was out. I and another woman and two men were sent with the beaters, while the others cantered on to take up positions ahead, where it was supposed likely that the pigs would break cover. Down the hill, therefore, I rode with the motley assemblage of Arabs and dogs, till we came to a strip of shrubs growing in detached clumps (rather like rhododendrons) along the sea-shore; here we found more beaters waiting with their dogs, and the Sheik mounted on a ragged-looking mule. And now came the oddest sight I had yet seen in this queer land of surprises. The Arabs gathered together in a semicircle with their dogs at their feet, and the Sheik rode forward to address them. With much gesture, and in a loud clear voice, he prayed in his strange, guttural language that Allah would bless the Sultan, and all the men piously touched their fingers together and cried Amen; then that he would give them fine weather and good crops, and again they cried Amen ; that he would bless their sport and give them many pigs—and again Amen—and then he exhorted them to beat well, and not to quarrel,, but to be peaceable and friendly, and that Allah then would bless- them, and their crops, and their families, and their sport, and all would be well; and he bade them depart and begin. And once more they all cried Amen; and the dogs sprang to their feet, the men gathered up guns and sticks, and we were all ready for the fray. The Arabs kept a very good line, shouting all the time their strange quavering Arab cry, encouraging the dogs, adjuring the pigs— we on horseback following as well as the stones and bushes would allow ; but no pigs showed themselves. Everywhere we came upon traces of the pigs having recently turned up the ground in search of roots—but there it ended. All the morning it was the same thing— the day was beautiful, the ride delightful, but no pigs. By luncheon time only one pig had been found; it was very disheartening. After luncheon we started afresh, still with the same result; and I began to think the pig must have become a very rare animal. We had now gone over a good deal of ground; it was three o'clock, and we had reached a cork wood with thinly scattered trees, many low shrubs, and a quantity of something like our broom in glorious flower. Suddenly one of the beaters fired his gun—he had seen a pig ! Then another and another fired; it was going along the line; it was breaking back ! Away past me through the bushes spurred the Due1892 CAMP LIFE 629 de Frias, shouting to me to follow. Other horsemen, spears in hand, dashed past; the Arabs yelled, the dogs gave tongue; it was a wild skurry, everyone choosing that path through the bushes that seemed best and safest; Sultan, to my utter dismay, now clearing a bush, now skipping a bit of morass, very much guiding himself at his own sweet will, and quite determined not to be out of it. Then presently the sounds died away; and shortly, one by one, the hunters returned ; the pig had been lost, had got into some bog or impenetrable bush, and we were all to rejoin the beaters as fast as we could. I turned my horse and, rather breathless from my unaccustomed exertions, trotted quietly after the others, meditative about many things, and settling that I would now quietly stick with the beaters, and have no more wild gallops. But before I had reached that would-be haven, there was again the report of a gun and wild yells from the Arabs, and then, straight through the bushes, about twenty yards ahead, on the rising ground in front, came bursting a huge unwieldy black thing, jumping from tussock to tussock, looking to me more the size of a cow (I should like to say an elephant!) than a pig. By its side, striving to keep up with it, with his lance ready to strike, rode Colonel Hibbert, close by him raced the Due, and all bearing down straight on me. Every story I had heard of boars attacking and ripping up any and everybody that came in their way rushed into my head, mingled with English traditions of heading the fox ; I pressed my spur hard against Sultan's side, and inwardly breathed a prayer that a gracious Providence would for this once grant that Sultan should obey the rein. I rather think that Sultan himself was terrified ; we swerved ; past us shot the boar and the two hunters; we turned and followed; others came galloping up. Again a wild skurry and hunt, more prolonged this time as the pig did get away. Colonel Hibbert got the first spear, and the Due de Frias the second: or was it the Due who got the first ?—this I did not clearly make out, as some said one and some the other. But it did not matter much to the pig, who lay dead far on in the wood ; while the hunters galloped back to rejoin the outpaced ladies, and to catch up once more with the beaters. That wood was alive with pigs. Thirteen of them did we start in those two hours we were hunting in it, though only five were killed; and as we all collected together again, to make the best of our way with tired horses to the far-distant camp, we were all agreed that we had had a most successful hunt. And as I stumbled up the last hill in the dark, it was delightful to think how soon I should be able to take my wearied self off my equally weary horse. That was our last evening in the camp. Once more after dinner we sat round the camp fire, now a reduced party—so many had left in the morning. Of course we talked over the day's adventures, till, as the ready-cut branches began to fail and the fire to die down, we630 THE NINETEENTH April went off early to our tent, and, very tired, crept into our narrow beds, and so went quickly to sleep with the sounds of camp life still stir ring round us. In the night I woke up. A heavy shower was rattling down on the canvas, two dogs were snarling at each other just out side the tent, and the Arabs were chattering as usual; but I felt a delicious indifference to it all, and quickly dropped off to sleep again. In the morning it was pleasant to feel that there was no occasion for a great scramble in dressing, as there was no hunting start at 8.30. The pigsticking was to go on for two more days, but this was to be an off-day to rest both beaters and horses; the sky looked very threatening, and we couldn't help feeling that a house over our heads might have its attractions. Everybody had been most kind and attentive and nice. Our two Captains from Gibraltar had been un wearied in their care of us, hammering in our tent pegs, looking to our tent ropes, lending us their shooting-boots (such as they were, but so delightfully dry as they kept us), their rugs, their waterproofs. The weather had been against us, but we had gained an experience; had seen pretty well both the pleasant and unpleasant sides of camping out, and had had a most successful hunt. We had enjoyed the open-air life and the gallops over the wild country ; had revelled in the sun when it shone, and had discovered it was best to see the humour of the thing when, on the contrary, everything was damp or soaking. And so at eleven o'clock that morning our little caravan of horses and mules set out once more across country under the charge of M. Bosch, and late that afternoon we had returned to civilisation, or at least such civilisation as may be found at Bruzeaud's Hotel, just outside the walls of white Tangier, in Morocco. H enrietta G- eey E gerton.1892 G31 IMPRESSIONS THE CANADIAN T hough the 'Great Lone Land' is no longer a to the reading public at home, there is not enough known about Manitoba, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia by the people of the United Kingdom. This is a pity; as I am persuaded, after a pretty extensive tour through those regions during last autumn, that if anything like full and true information of the real extent, fruitfulness of soil, and unequalled advantages of this immense and interesting portion of the Empire were in possession of the public of Grreat Britain and Ireland, the North-West would not long remain so thinly populated. Want of fuller information is not the only obstacle to the creation of a deeper interest in the subject of these countries. There is a good deal which must be unlearned about Manitoba and its adjacent provinces before a true estimate of their worth and attractiveness can be formed. The means and methods employed to colonise them have not been the happiest in plans or most fruitful in results. A generally wrong impression is conveyed in the pictorial representa tions of Canada, in which she is invariably represented to Europeans as a female, attractive-looking of course, but always clad in furs and living in a land of snow shoes and ice palaces. The climate of North western Canada is little, if any, colder than that of north Minnesota, north Dacota, and other portions of the United States ; but we never find the practical Americans giving a figurative representation of their country suggestive of perpetual winter in any part of their great Republic. Manitoba, which has been given a very bad climatic reputation, has not an average of more than a few degrees more cold than western Nebraska. Frosts are earlier, it is true, and the injury with which they menace the wheat harvest is the one real drawback and danger to the farming industry of an otherwise exceptionally favoured land. But this is a danger which is certain to decrease, in proportion to the growth of population and the singular but sure influence which the tillage of the soil, the erection of dwellings, and the other632 THE NINETEENTH April necessary labours of an inhabited country exercise upon its climate. If, as the farmers of Ontario say, the clapping of the rooster's wings prevents freezing within the barn, the smoke of villages, the making of roads, erection of fences, and the application of the plough to the prairie sod will necessarily modify the climate, as has been the case in northern Minnesota, and produce other variations of temperature which will make the Manitoban and Assiniboian autumn frosts less injurious to the cultivation of wheat and other cereal products, and the winters less preventive of active open-air work. I sought for the opinions of the Crofters at Grienboro and Pelican Lake on this subject of the Manitoban winter, and in no instance was it complained that the cold was injurious to health, or, except in brief intervals, prohibitive of such outdoor work as has to be done round a farmhouse in that season. I also canvassed the views of some of my own countrymen at Calgary and other places upon this point, and received a similar account. Thirty degrees below zero all but freezes one's imagination where, as in Ireland and Great Britain, the glass at thirty above it sends those who can afford it off to sunnier climes, and makes those who cannot sigh for the return of summer. The cold in northern regions like Manitoba is, however, dry and ex hilarating in its effects, and produces none of the chills and kindred consequences to health associated with a winter in a damp climate like that of the United Kingdom. People affected with asthma, or suffering from other chest diseases, fare well in the North-West. That it is intensely cold in mid-winter in Manitoba goes without saying. But, I am convinced, the climate of that province is no more severe upon the human body than that of Nebraska, Wyoming, north Minnesota, or north Dacota in the United States; the only differ ence being that arising from the more populous and more developed condition of these localities, as compared with Manitoba, Assiniboia. and Alberta. The climate of British Columbia, notwithstanding its latitude, is as mild in winter as that of the United Kingdom, but far more enjoyable in summer than ours. Mr. John Morley's historic expression, ' Manacles and Manitoba/ has not tended to popularise colonisation in the North-West. It has helped rather to create the impression that the country is a British Siberia, to which no one should go by choice, and to which Lord Salisbury hoped to send the Irish peasantry— there to perish from the rigours of an Arctic clime. I knew something about ' manacles' of old, and I learned a good deal, last fall, about Manitoba; and bad as the first part of the Salisburian remedy is, the second or geo graphical part, seriously considered, is not deserving of being coupled even in metaphor with the major proposition of Tory policy of Ireland. But what has done most harm to Manitoba and the adjacent Territories, in my belief, is the class of settler whom the agents for the Dominion Government in Europe have sought after most. The1892 IMPRESS! ON8 OF NOR 633 ' Small Capitalist' is a very useful member of society anywhere, where he is not too much of a capitalist, or of a gentleman, to work with hands or brains, particularly with the former. In a new country the ' capital' is an invaluable asset when it is translated into ploughs, horses, cattle, &amp;c. But when it is not in itself large enough to enable the owner to live on the labour of others, and the possessor has neither inclination to work nor experience how to have his industrial incapacity neutralised by aid of his money, he is not of much account as a settler. In my inquiries about the relative success of various classes of colonists, I found that in almost every in stance where a man brought a pair of willing hands and some knowledge of land labour with him he succeeded, even without a penny capital to start with. Where a small amount of money alone was the equipment, and there was neither industrial training nor labour in clination, the settler either went to the wall, left the country, or joined the mounted police. All those who thus failed placed the blame, of course, upon the country and climate. As a countryman of mine said to me in Calgary upon this subject: 'We have had a large number of young Englishmen out here with some money, but little brains and less love for labour. They dressed themselves on arrival in picturesque cowboy costume, rode about on Indian ponies during the day, tried to teach us the Cockney way of pronouncing Manitoba, played cards and gambled until the small hours in the morning, lost their money, and went to bed cursing the country. More remittances from home would be demanded by these gentle men, and in the end such ' Colonists' either returned to England, with harrowing accounts of Manitoban winters and mosquito sum mers, and a conclusion that the North-West was only suitable for Indians and Halfbreeds, or they remained dead broke and volunteered to watch the cattle thieves and frontiers, as mounted police, for fifty cents a day.' Almost every European nationality is represented in the colonisa tion of Manitoba and Assiniboia—Icelanders and Italians, Russians and Jews, French and Grermans, Bulgarians, &amp;c. The best and most successful farmers are from Ontario. Among the foreign settlers, the Icelanders, who are coming over in large numbers, are spoken of very highly for their industry, sobriety, and strict honesty. They contract no debts, and pay cash for all purchases. A Mannanite settlement in Southern Manitoba is remarkable for its exclusiveness. They are dissenting Russians, and do not inter-marry or hold social intercourse with other settlers. They occupy some of the best lands in Manitoba, and, being very industrious and thrifty, are reputed wealthy. At Regina, the seat of Grovernment for the Territories of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, I had an interesting interview with a settler who was one of a community of seventy families who634 THE NINETEENTH April had left Southern Russia seven years ago—' not,' said my informant, ' on account of the large farms which we now possess, but in order to enjoy greater liberty and to pay less taxes.' These interesting people went to Southern Russia, during the wars of the first Napoleon, from Bavaria. They are all Catholics. They settled in Assiniboia a few years ago, built their cabins and outhouses in Russian style, and are now free from all debt and doing remarkably well. They are engaged at present in bringing over all their friends. I found very few Irish or English employed on the land. They are in the towns, and affect professions, trade, and speculation more than agriculture. In Winnipeg, Brandon, Eegina, and Calgary, in Manitoba and the Territories, and in Victoria, Vancouver, and New Westminster, in British Columbia, there are many able and enterprising Irishmen who are identified with all that is being done to develop the North-West. The best possible feeling obtains between the British and Irish nationalities, though the efforts that are being made in Lower Canada to extend the Orange organisation throughout the entire Dominion are calculated to keep alive the old religious and racial animosities. There is no fear, however, of this politico-religious anachronism doing much mischief of this kind. The English-speaking inhabitants are too well educated, and too much imbued with democratic principles, to allow Orange bogies to beget a recrudescence of the evils which are historically associated with the introduction of this movement into Canada. Not the least interesting part of a tour in these new countries is the study of their methods of administering their own affairs. A Home Euler is thoroughly at home in the North-West. Some one has truly said that it is necessary to visit the British colonies in order to see and learn the real application of constitutional principles to practical popular government. Hereditary legislators are as ridiculously absurd to the Canadian mind as to that of Uncle Sam over the border. ' Grovernment of the people, by the people, for the people' is as firmly held to in the institutions and politics of the Dominion as in those of the United States. In many respects the constitution of Canada is more thoroughly democratic than that of the neighbouring Republic. In the provincial Parliaments a still further advance has been made towards securing direct popular con trol. The Federal Legislature of Canada has two chambers. Ontario, the most prosperous and the best ruled of the provinces of Lower Canada, has, however, adopted the unicameral system. So has Manitoba and British Columbia. Manhood suffrage prevails in the North-West, with a six months residential qualification. There is payment of members also, along with that of election expenses; with, however, the proviso—for the prevention of bogus candidatures and waste of public money—that each candidate shall deposit 200 dollars on nomination, which money is returned if 200 or more votes are1892 IMPRESSIONS OF JWR 635 recorded for such candidate. The Manitoban Parliament is elected every four years. In the social and industrial organisation of these embryo com munities, it is also satisfactory to find that vested interests are not allowed to dominate the natural and domestic rights of the citizen, as in the landlord- and lawyer-ridden United Kingdom. A homestead law, even more favourable to industry and home life than that of the United States, obtains in the North-Western Territories. The following real and personal property are declared exempt from seizure by virtue of all writs of execution issued by any court in the Territories (Revised Ordinances N.W.T. cap. 45):— 1. Clothing of defendant and family. 2. Furniture and household furnishings of defendant and family, to value of ^500. 3. Necessary food for defendant's family for six months, which may include grain and flour, or vegetables and meat, either prepared for use or on foot. 4. Two cows, two oxen, and one horse, or three horses or mules; six sheep and two pigs, besides the animals kept for food purposes, and food for same during the six months beginning in November. 5. Harness for three animals, one waggon or two carts, one mower or scythe, one breaking plough, one cross-plough, one set harrows, one borse-rake, one sewing machine, one reaper and binder. 6. Books of a professional man. 7. Tools and necessaries used by defendant in trade or profession. 8. Seed grain sufficient to seed all land under cultivation not exceeding eighty acres (two bushels to acre, and fourteen bushels of potatoes). 9. Homestead up to eighty acres. 10. House and buildings, and lot or lots upon which same are situated, up to tbe sum of $1,500 in value. No article (except of food, clothing, or bedding) is exempt from seizure where tbe judgment and execution are for the price of such article. The treatment of the native Indians is far more humane and enlightened in the Canadian North-West than the system of exter mination by commissioners and rum adopted by the Government of the United States. This is due mainly to the long and arduous labours of the French Catholic missionary priests. The Canadian Grovernment has done its part, however, in the work of inducing the former occupants and masters of this immense section of the North American continent to put off the customs of savage for the habits of civilised life. No drink can be sold in the North-West to an Indian under a severe penalty—including, I believe, the forfeiture of a license to sell intoxicating liquor in future. One of the prettiest pictures in the unrivalled scenic panorama of Vancouver city, in British Columbia, is that presented by an Indian village of white houses, with a white church in the centre, peeping out from a forest of pines on the banks of Burrard Inlet. The inhabitants all live by fishing or lumber industry. At New Westminster, on the Fraser636 THE NINETEENTH April River, I visited the salmon canneries of McEwan &amp; Co., where some 200 Indians are employed. I saw by the books of the estab lishment that some of these earned as much as $ 900 in a six weeks' fishing last year. Those who worked within the cannery earned over two dollars a day, while squaws were paid one and a quarter. The manager assured me that the Indians were better workers than the Chinese, and earned more money. During the close season for salmon and game, the Indians are by law allowed to fish and shoot for ' the pot.' On completing a most interesting inspection of Mr. McEwan's establishment, I was ' serenaded' by a brass band, composed entirely of full-breed Indians, with through Tara's Halls —admirably rendered, too, from written music! No description, however full and eloquent, can do justice to the scenery of the Canadian Eockies and British Columbia. The human eye alone can do so. The countless giant peaks, clothed in everlast ing robes of snow, the glaciers, waterfalls, lakes, rivers, valleys, and pine woods which pass before the gaze of the bewildered traveller from Banff, in Alberta, to Vancouver would make half-a-dozen Switzerlands, and leave enough of Alpine material and glacier wonders over to supply every other country in Europe with as much of the marvellous and the sublime in nature as would suffice for home admiration. Groing down the enchanting canon of the Eraser, one is puzzled which to marvel at most—the variety and beauty and wild extravagance of scenic grandeur, or the daring genius of man, as seen in the construction of a railway through a region where pre cipitous, but timber-clad, mountains and roaring torrent were appar ently intended by nature to reign supreme. Lamartine, in his Voyage en Orient, writing of the effect which the first sight of the ruins of Balbec made upon his mind, said that if a language existed which would convey in a word as much as the eye could take in at a glance, it alone would enable him to describe the views before him in a manner that would interpret his impressions of them to his readers. A language of this compass would be needed in order to give a true conception of the five hundred miles continuation of every possible combination of natural scenery along which the Canadian Pacific Railway carries the tourist, from Banff, on the summit of the Eockies, to Vancouver, on the banks of Burrard Inlet. Everybody you meet, from Winnipeg to Victoria, talks emigration. In the trains, hotels, and streets it is the one subject a stranger will have introduced to him by whomever he asks for information. You cannot help sympathising with this feeling, although, to a large extent, its source is found in land speculation. Apart from this sympathy, however, it was profoundly discouraging to find the evil hand of landlord absenteeism holding its grip upon the country and keeping back its development. The lands granted by the Dominion1892 IMPRESSIONS OF NORTH-WEST 637 Government to the half-breeds, in the immediate neighbourhood of 'Winnipeg, are among the richest in the province. Two hundred and forty acres were given to each member of a family, but were sold by them to speculators for little or nothing. These purchasers are mostly absentees, and the lands thus acquired are held for speculative values by people residing in Lower Canada and England, while the city of Winnipeg has to suffer from thousands of acres of soil lying idle in its immediate vicinity, which if occupied and cultivated would add enormously to the prosperity of the handsome and progressive capital of Manitoba. The same state of things exists, more or less, in connection with every city and town throughout the entire North- West, and it is most sincerely to be hoped that the men who have helped so far by residence, pluck, and enterprise to organise these centres of industry and reclaim the country around from prairie savagery will soon demand from the Dominion Legislature the power to tax the absentee owners of all lands—and residential owners, to a less extent—so as to compel them either to put the soil of the country to its legitimate use, or to pay in taxation to local authorities for the privilege of holding it in idleness. No matter what one's views upon emigration may be—and mine are very radical and have been frequently stated—it is impossible to e visit this vast and naturally rich region of the North-West, with its 1 all but limitless extent of rich loamy-subsoiled land, without a yearning for the transplantation of some of the dense population of parts of Great Britain to these fruitful prairies. When one has to call to mind the slum-life of London, the squalid quarters of the working poor in Liverpool, Glasgow, Manchester, and other large centres of ie crowded social life, and the conditions under which tens of thousands ^ of such people live—while, on the other hand, he views, day after a day, millions of acres of arable soil hungering for the application of food-producing labour, it is impossible not to have one's opinions influenced more or less in favour of a movement which might ease and tend to eradicate these demoralising conditions of labour-life in Great Britain, while removing their victims to the advantages of those all but unpeopled regions of bracing air, and healthful life, and latent opportunities of a better and brighter social existence. It would, however, be a huge mistake to bring some of the class of people who overcrowd our cities at home out to the North-West. They are not the kind of colonists whom the country would suit, or who could help in its development. Men or women who work in factories or employ themselves in the smaller handicrafts and miscel laneous occupations of centres of complex industrial organisation, would be like fishes out of water where the main, if not only, form of labour is in connection with land. Those who have been brought up to agriculture, or who have strength and willingness to work the land, are the class of colonists who are wanted, and to whom VOL. XXXI—NO. 182 XX638 THE NINETEENTH April Manitoba or British Columbia would offer a field of industry in wliich a new social life of comparative comfort could be won in a few years' time. The emigration of such settlers would likewise excite less oppo sition from Trade Unions at home and in Canada. Kightly, and reasonably enough, the organised workmen of the Canadian cities object most strongly to the importation of artisans, mechanics, and labourers (non-agricultural), who would crowd the labour market of the Dominion, lower wages by competition, and become a disturbing element in the economic relations between labour and capital. These objections, however, could not be urged against land-workers, who might be brought out, or induced to come under plans that would insure their being located where good land, and plenty of it, would provide immediate employment to such intending settlers. The advent of such a class would be hailed as directly advantageous to the interests of skilled industry in Canada. The more farmers the country possesses, the more work there necessarily is for the general mechanic. The emigration of a large number of agricultural labourers from Grreat Britain should also be viewed with less hos tility by leaders of the labour movement and radical social re formers at home. The country worker is the chief disturber of the labour market of our cities and towns. The causes of his voluntary or involuntary migration are too well known to need dwelling upon here. The problem now is how to keep those on the land who have not yet migrated, and how best to put those back who have. In the solution of such a problem lies a hope of a better and higher future for both land and town labour. Legislation is at last moving in the direction which will facilitate such a reform, though we are not likely to witness anything like a boom in land labour until public ownership of the soil replaces that of the landlords. When that day arrives—and we are moving rapidly towards it—capital in its struggle with labour will have less of the ' blackleg ' class of competing work men to fall back upon in such conflicts as may arise, while organised workmen in cities and towns will have a better chance of winning a fairer share of the wealth produced by the country than that which they obtain under existing economic conditions. In the meantime, however, and pending the radical changes which are in the contem plation of those ' who dream dreams' which have acquired the habit of becoming embodied in legislative programmes evolved from com peting Liberal and Tory parties, the colonisation of the countries of the North-West by such past and present victims of landlord mono poly as would be willing to go from wage-slavery to practical social independence, would work on parallel lines to the ' back to the land' movement in Grreat Britain and Ireland. I visited two of the crofter settlements during my tour—one at Glenboro, and the other at Pelican Lake, both in Manitoba. The1892 IMPRESSIONS OF NOR 639 remaining colony, that of Saltcoates, north-west of Winnipeg, I did not go to, as I became [satisfied, after interviewing about a dozen heads of families in the two first-named places, that visitors from the ' old country' do more harm than good to these particular settlers. It creates an impression on their minds that public opinion at home is actively agitated on their account, and that 'something more' remains yet to be done for them. In a very few instances this feeling of expectancy has produced discontent, and led to idleness. But all to whom I spoke admitted they were far better off than they ever would have been had they remained in Harris, Lewis, or the other parts of the Crofter Highlands whence they hailed. John McLeod, from near Stornoway, I found farming a whole section of 640 acres. He had 120 acres under wheat, and was break ing seventy more for this year's sowing. Himself and three sons worked the land, with three yokes of oxen and a team of horses. The old man told me he had five head of cattle, and that he was well satisfied with the country, and expected to do very well on his farm. He contrasted its extent and his future prospects with the three-acre croft on which he had lived for over forty years in the Island of Lewis, and his only regret was that he could not bring his two daughters and a brother, who were still in Stornoway, out to his new home. He assured me that all his crofter neighbours at Pelican Lake were doing well, though they, like himself, were still in debt to the grocers in Killarney (the market town for Pelican Lake), owing to the two bad years which followed their arrival from Scotland, Donald McDonald, of Lewis, said he was well contented, but would like to pay Lewis a visit. He owns 160 acres, fifty being under wheat, and possesses a yoke of oxen and three cows. John McKenzie, senior, from Lewis, would like to return home. He had been more of a fisherman than a crofter, and he ' longed for the sea breeze.' He had fifty acres under wheat, and was apparently doing well, Kenneth Macaulay, also from Lewis, was delighted with his loa* house, sixty-five acres of wheat (on a quarter-section of 160 acres)! three acres of oats, two cows, and yoke of oxen; but his son de nounced the whole of Manitoba, and all those who had helped to bring him there. His father, however, blamed ' the disturber from Saltcoates,' who had visited Pelican Lake, for the discontent which young Kenneth expressed, and assured me that it had no real meaning. Donald McDonald, Angus McDonald, John Morrison, and Allan McLeod farm a section (640 acres) in conjunction, I saw 260 acres of this unaer wheat, while each had some five acres of oats in addi tion. They also possessed a yoke of oxen each, and from two to four cows. x x 2640 the nineteenth April I drove by tlie log cabins of a dozen more of the crofters in this settlement, and saw their fields of wheat, promising at that time (August last) to free the owners from the debts which had been in curred in 1888 and 1889, in consequence of the unseasonable period of their arrival, and the bad wheat season which followed. I am thoroughly satisfied, from what I have seen of these crofters, rom their own admissions, and the additional information o tame rom old settlers near them, that, with ordinary industry, they are certain to become prosperous farmers in a few years' time.^ ^ Before leaving the subject of crofter colonisation in the JNort West I think it well to say a few words with reference to a proposed settlement of this class in the San Juan Valley, on Vancouver Island. Upon learning in Victoria that it was intended to carry out such a scheme, and that the Imperial Government had promised 50,000£. towards the locating of two hundred crofter families m this valley, I resolved to pay the place a visit, and see if it was adapted for such a settlement. Port San Juan is almost opposite Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Straits of San Juan de Fuca,and about sixty miles by sea from Victoria, B .C. The harbour is about a mile and a half wide at the entrance, and three deep, with an average of six fathoms of water. The rivers San Juan and Gordon empty themselves into the bay at opposite extremities. Both are narrow rivers, full of silver salmon and trout. ' Port San Juan ' consists of about twenty Indian cabins, whose owners live by the seal fishing in the Behring Seas. The San Juan Valley is very heavily timbered, except where some few miles from the village it is flooded by a jamb, caused by an accumulation of logs. The valley is a Government reservation, and consists of about twelve thousand acres, and by far the most of this is composed of mountain, which is too steep and unsuitable, even when cleared of timber, for tillage purposes—at least, as seen from the Indian village. The valley would be a Paradise for sportsmen, as deer, elk, and black-bear are numerous, while there is an abundance of ducks and geese, which appear to inhabit almost every part of the North-West. The place would not answer for a crofter settlement. It would take years before the timber could be lumbered away, and crofters are not the right class of people for work of this kind. There are other parts of British Columbia which would be much better adapted for such a class of colonists than the Valley of the San Juan. I was informed by people who know the country well that around Alberni and near Port Simpson, on Vancouver Island, there are Government lands more or less free from timber. At Kootenay, Okanogan, and Chilliwick, on the mainland of British Columbia, there is an abundance of the richest land available for tillage, but it is all, I believe, in the hands of speculating companies. This is also the case with respect to the land in the delta of the Fraser Eiver, the richest soil to be found possibly on any part of the North American1892 IMPRESSIONS OF NOR 641 continent. It reminds one very much of the fat soil of Lombardy along the river Po. The charming little city of New Westminster is -situated near the very centre of this favoured comer of the province, and no one visiting British Columbia should think of leaving before paying a visit to this city. The famous salmon-canneries of the Eraser are to be found here, while numerous other forms of industrial prosperity are contributing to make this ' royal city,' as it is called, a rich and thriving community. To no part of the North-West would English or Irish agricultural labourers, or Scotch crofters, be more welcome than to this section of the province ; but there is, unfortu nately, this drawback—that the Government has given away all its best lands, which are held for speculative values by absentee and other owners, and colonists would therefore have to pay stiff prices (though ridiculously small in European eyes), as compared with the cost of land in Manitoba or Assiniboia, for holdings in the favoured region of New Westminster. It is this state of things, more than any other cause, which still leaves these naturally favoured countries of the North-West com paratively unpopulated. All the best land has been given away to railway companies, 'free, gratis, and for nothing,' or sold for little or nothing to syndicates, companies, corporations, and indi vidual speculators. These owners are mostly absentees, and are doing absolutely nothing (railway companies excepted) towards the development of a country over millions of acres of whose soil they hold a monopoly. They are simply waiting for the advent of that population which will give value to their possessions ; while the Government, which desires to attract colonists, has parted with those very lands which would offer the strongest inducement to settlers to come. This is especially true of British Columbia, and more is the pity, because, taken all round, in mildness of climate, loveliness of scenery, richness of soil, and in the variety and abundance of its mineral wealth, it is the most favoured of all the North-Western countries, and is destined in my belief to become, in the near future, an irresistible attraction to Americans, as well as to Europeans, desiring a change of home location. To propose the colonisation of the Canadian North-West by means of one or two hundred thousand agricultural labourers from Great Britain will seem a ' large order.' The opponents of emigration will foe up in arms at once in opposition to any such suggestion. Para doxical as it may appear, I am not, and never have been, an advocate of emigration. My present proposal is made homoeopathically. It would, if carried out, promote many interests which have not been benefited by the process of emigration that has called forth the ob jections of radical land reformers, and other labour advocates, who ■demand the full utilisation of the soil of Great Britain for labour purposes before British workers are sent away to colonial or other642 THE NINETEENTH April countries in search, of work which is practically denied them at home through the operation of the rent-earning system of land tenure. To withdraw 100,000 land-workers from the agricultural industry of these countries would enhance the price of the labour that would remain. Wages would necessarily go up, while the influx of labourers from the country into towns would be diminished, to the advantage of town toilers. Farmers would grumble at a scarcity of labour, and the certainty of a higher price having to be paid for the diminished quantity. Ultimately, however, the landlord would have to bear the burden of higher wages to land-labourers, as his sleeping- partner interest in land cultivation will be that which will justly and reasonably lend itself, in the form of lower rents, to the demands for the better payment of agricultural working men. Protests will come from this gentleman also, no doubt. This, however, will only lead to a British Land Commission and the fixing of fair rents by judicial process, as now obtains in Ireland; after submitting to which experi ence the English, Welsh, and Scotch, like the Irish, landlord will advocate a Purchase Act, or Landlord Belief Bill for Grreat Britain. Whether by the process of being bought out, or of being taxed out, the landlord must, of economic necessity, go. The sooner the better for the industrial welfare of three countries. When he is replaced by County or District or Village Councils, the anomaly of vested interest barriers standing between idle acres and idle but willing hands to work them will no longer mock the absence of a little com mon-sense in our land laws. When land is looked at and legislated upon as a medium for the employment of labour—and consequently for food-production—and not as a means of growing rent, or of providing a social status for a landed aristocracy, it will be unnecessary to advocate the manning of the land of Manitoba with Scotch crofters or English agricultural labourers. It will be remembered when such a day arrives, that we have inside this United Kingdom more soil lying idle, but capable of giving work and growing food, than is comprised within the kingdom of Belgium, with its 5,000,000 of an industrial population. Such a day is rapidly approaching, no doubt. ' The land for the people' period of legislation is dawning, and we shall soon see Mr. Chaplin's Bill amended in the two directions in which it is most de fective—to give to Village Councils the right of expropriating landlord owners, and empowering them to administer the land in the way which will best promote the industrial interests of the locality. When the Community becomes the landlord, land will not be left idle if willing hands are ready to employ themselves in its cultivation. It will be recognised then that if the soil can do no more than give employment to farmer and labourer, the all-round economic advan tage to other industrial classes will be of far greater benefit to the country at large than the social status of a single proprietor who can1892 IMPRESSIONS OF NORTH-WEST 643 now determine whether or not it shall be cultivated or allowed to lie useless. And if economic rent accrues, all the better for the Com munity. But that day is not yet. In the meantime, the lot of the land less agricultural labour excites the active sympathy of reformers and demands the attention of the Legislature. He is also a disturber of the labour market in industrial centres. He is virtually driven off the land, by low wages and a cheerless prospect, into the towns and cities, or he voluntarily goes there in search of a more varied exist ence ; and in the struggle to obtain his desires he brings down the wages of other workers, adds to the congestion of city life, and creates the social problem. A great Imperial purpose would likewise be promoted by colonising the North-West by such a class as that indicated. Canada, of itself, cannot develop this extensive region of rich soil. She has neither the means nor the population to do so. She has done her best, but that, much as it is when her limited resources are considered, counts for very little compared with what the vastness of the territory hungering for population requires, if it is to remain a part of the Do mini on, and its boundless possibilities are to be opened up to labour and enterprise. Annexation may or may not be the best solution of the Canadian question. I found comparatively few in the North-West who favoured incorporation with the United States. Next to a desire to remain within the Empire was a feeling for independence ; which sentiment, however, was held as a preference to annexation, and as contingent upon the Dominion and Imperial Governments failing to do for the North-West what the United States would undoubtedly perform, if the Stars and Stripes were permitted to supplant the Union Jack north of the international boundary line. Much as there is to admire in the government of the United States, I confess I would not wish to see it extend its sway across the St. Lawrence to the North Pole. It possesses quite enough of territory already. The further it is ex tended, the weaker will become the central influence which is ruling so wisely and so well so vast a continent, embracing communities including people of every European race, by the simple but efficient method of allowing the citizens of the Kepublic to manage their own affairs in their own way. No friend of free institutions would wish to see the federal system of the United States weakened. Its great object-lesson of government by the people will ultimately help to democratise all European Governments; and upon international grounds alone the acquisition of Canada by the United States would be a misfortune. Independent, Canada may become. She has the chance if she wills it, along with territory enough to form a heritage fit for an empire. But such independence, if established in defiance of the Imperial Government, would always be menaced by theTHE NINETEENTH April Republic of sixty or more millions over tlie border; and a Home Government whicli might neither consent to separation nor hold Canada by force if she insisted on going, wonld be under no obliga tion to prevent a conquest by Uncle Sam after Canada should cut the Imperial connection. The question for the North-West is, therefore, one of colonisation or annexation. Things political and economic cannot remain much longer as they are now in Canada without producing a smash. Ontario is the only one of the provinces financially sound. All the others are immersed in debt, with no credit upon which to borrow ; while the recent ex posures of malversation, both in connection with the Dominion Administration and the Grovernment of Quebec, are not calculated to help the country at large to get its finances into a satisfactory condition for some time to come. Bad as all this is for Lowei Canada, it spells all but ruin for the North-West, unless a remedy can be found. The Territories not yet admitted, for v* ant of popula tion, to the privileges of a province have recently demanded an increase in their annual federal subsidy from ^150,000 to ^400,000; and as Ontario has, practically, to provide these moneys for the Dominion Grovernment to grant towards the development of a part of Canada which has already enticed a large number of Ontario farmers to ' fresh fields and pastures new,' there will be opposition offered to this enlarged demand when it comes up for consideration before the Ottawa Legislature. But without help in some shape or form, the North-West must inevitably fall into the hands of the United States. Manitoba has to get along with a united revenue and subsidy of some ,$600,000. The combined administrative income of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, is no more than ^170,000 annually. I have not got the figures representing the revenue and federal subsidy of British Columbia, but I am safe in saying that the entire financial resources for the government of the whole Xorth-\\ est fall short of 300,000?. a year. Nothing in the way of a proper development of so vast an area can be accomplished upon a pauper revenue of this figure. It is true the Dominion Parliament votes money every year for colonisation purposes. This represents an additional assistance, I admit, and that too of the best kind; as the one essential need of these countries is population. But it is not by any means certain that the best results have been obtained in this work for the money expended. I found the opinion prevailing in Manitoba and the Terri tories that it would have been much more workable and advantageous if the Federal Legislature had loaned money at low interest to the North-West Provinces, and allowed them to carry out their own ideas as to the best means of bringing the right class of colonists to their lands. Now that one of the finest railway systems in the world places the North-West in direct communication with the Atlantic seaboard,1892 IMPRESSIONS OF NORTH-WEST 645 it should be the aim of Imperial and Dominion statesmanship com bined to substitute a better system for the spoon-feeding policy which has been so far pursued towards these Provinces, and which has not succeeded in giving them strength enough to utilise the immense resources with which they abound. A fair start should be given to them, and then throw them upon their own ways and means for necessary administrative revenue. An Imperial loan of 10,000,000^. at low interest, through the Dominion Government, would enable the Provinces and Territories to bring 100,000 select colonists from Grreat Britain, and such an addition to the present population—small as it would even then be for a country much larger than France—would give such a stimulus to the colonisation and development which have proceeded so far, that the future of this richest but most neglected part of the Colonial Empire would be assured. The interest upon such a loan might be charged in equal shares upon the Dominion Government and the Provinces and Terri tories of the North-West, but a ten years' grace might be given to the latter, during which period this half of the interest should remain an Imperial charge as a contribution to the work of development in that part of the Empire. In my judgment, this would solve the whole difficulty of the Canadian North-West. Manitoba, British Columbia, and the Terri tories would plan and carry out their own colonisation work in the manner best suited to their respective requirements. They know now where the best kind of settlers come from, and, with the means at their disposal of inducing those that are wanted to come, no time would be lost in locating the imported industry where it is most needed and would produce the best results. The additional wheat cultivation and increase of other kinds of agriculture which 100,000 new farms must necessarily create, would soon operate to the great economic advantage of Lower Canada, which supplies all the farm implements in use in the North-West, as well as mostly all their other mechanical requirements, by means of the Canadian Pacific JRailway. The increased wheat produce which would accrue would have an important bearing upon our Home markets, and make them less susceptible to the influence of American grain rings and ' deal ings in futures.' Nor would the money needed to accomplish this work be a bad investment from a purely Imperial point of view. The Canadian Pacific Eailway has recently presented itself in quite a new light to some of our politicians who are wise enough to foresee a time when the Suez Canal may probably not answer as the safest route to India .and China for British troops or transports. In an emergency which might arise any day, Mr. Van Home and his incomparable system, by which Yokohama has been brought within twenty days of Liverpool, would become a priceless auxiliary to the War Office.646 THE NINETEENTH CEN April Should annexation be the indirect object at which the Washington Grovernment is now aiming in McKinleying the products of the Dominion, the Canadian Pacific would, in the event of the success of this policy, be added to the Railway rings of the United States. A free and uniquely advantageous highway to the East and to the Australasian colonies would then be lost, and a great Imperial con necting link be broken beyond the possibility of repair. There are those in Lower Canada, and of course in England too, who say that too much money has already been expended in the opening up of the North-West, and that the building of the Canadian Pacific has been a far too expensive enterprise from a Lower Canadian point of view. This is a very shortsighted view to take. Without the present and future development of the North- West to count upon, the fate of Lower Canada would be sealed. She might throw herself into the arms of the United States at once. Ten years from now the North-West will be far more necessary to Lower Canada than Lower Canada is to-day to British Columbia, Manitoba, and the Territories. The Canadian Pacific has annexed an empire of undeveloped resources to the Eastern section of the Dominion, which must ultimately be the economic salvation of the older but less naturally favoured Provinces. Certain I am, that if the Americans only knew more about the mineral resources of British Columbia, its wonderfully rich soil and teeming rivers, and of the riches represented in the vast areas of arable and pasture lands of the Territories and Manitoba, they would not hesitate in paying five times the amount of money that has been expended upon the North-West, in railways and other respects, in exchange for possessions representing untold material wealth and priceless political importance. The World's Fair at Chicago next year will, of course, invite an immense number of visitors from the United Kingdom. Those who have already seen the grounds upon which the Exposition will stand, as I have, and who can therefore form some idea of the unparalleled proportions, yet symmetrical arrangement, of the whole plans, will be more or less prepared for the biggest, brightest, and best effort of the kind ever put forth. But to those who have not had this advantage, and who may never have visited the United States before, the Chicago Exposition will offer a series of attractions which will leave a lifelong agreeable recollection behind. Once at Chicago, a trip to the Canadian North-West would be but an affair of an additional ten or fifteen days, in which small space of time, however, it will be possible to see a comparatively unknown and magnificent country, and enjoy the ' Sea of Mountains,' as the Canadian Eockies have been called, together with the softer but yet wild and incomparably varied and enchanting scenery of the Canon of the Eraser Eiver, as that monarch of western waters rolls down through gorge and precipice and valley to the wooded plains of British Columbia. No one1892 IMPRESSIONS OF NORTH-WEST 647 who takes this trip will ever regret it, if he or she possesses a taste for beauty in Nature, or has a soul that can respond to the sublimities of her greatest handiwork in mountain making. The Canadian Pacific Eailway is almost certain to arrange for such a trip in connection with the Chicago World's Fair. It will give British and Irish visitors a chance of seeing the North-West, and, as a better know ledge of its varied advantages is the essential thing required to push on the work of colonisation, it should be an object with the Canadian Pacific Eailway to make terms and arrangements for such a trip as I suggest as enticing as possible to visitors from the United Kingdom. A day's stop-over at Winnipeg, Eegina, Banff Hot Springs, Vancouver, and New Westminster, with, of course, a trip across to Victoria, in all of which places excellent hotel accommodation will be found, would enable the tourists to form some idea of the magnitude, resources, beauty, and general characteristics of a country which is destined, in my humble judgment, to become, even in the present generation, one of the most prosperous portions of the Colonial Empire. M ichael D avitt.648 THE NINETEENTH April COLOUR-BLINDNESS, AND ITS POSSIBLE PR T he dangers entailed upon the community by colour-blindness in sailors and railway officials are now matters of familiar knowledge, and more or less precaution is adopted against these dangers by a system of examination for defects in colour-sense. Sucli a system of examinations is, however, far from a perfect remedy against the dangers that result from colour-blindness. It is defective in three respects. First, unless where certain conditions, which are essential for accurate testing, are rigidly observed, the ex aminations may fail to disclose an existing defect of colour-vision, and colour-blind persons may thus be admitted to employment where, under the present conditions, they become a source of public danger. Secondly, where the examination is sufficiently searching, the detec tion of the defect in colour-vision involves the rejection of other wise capable servants, and therefore often the infliction of a considerable amount of personal hardship upon those who are thrown out of employment through their defect in colour-sense. Lastly, persons who are perfectly competent with regard to colour-vision may become colour-blind at any period subsequent to the admission examination. This may occur, for instance, from the excessive use of such a drug as tobacco. Examinations for defects in colour-vision require, therefore, to be repeated at intervals. It is thus evident that considerable advantage would accrue if it should turn out to be possible to do away with the whole apparatus of examinations for colour-blindness, and to continue the colour-blind in office without detriment to the public safety. An examination of the recent work which has been done in connection with colour blindness will show that this ought to be a realisable ideal. To point out the lines upon which its realisation is possible will necessitate a brief sketch of our present knowledge on the subject of colour- vision. The field is at present occupied by two competing theories of colour-vision. The first of these theories, which is known as the Young-Helmholtz hypothesis, proposes to explain the phenomena1892 COLOUR-BLINDNESS 649 of colour-vision by assuming that our colour-sensations depend on the stimulation of tihree separate sets of fibres or sensitive layers in the retina. The isolated stimulation of a single retinal layer would be associated with, a colour-sensation of red, green, and purple respec tively, and these three colours would therefore constitute the fundamental colours. All other colours would be derivatives of these, and their production would be explained by a simultaneous, but varying, amount of stimulation of either two or three of the hypo thetical retinal layers. Blue would, for instance, according to this theory, result from a simultaneous stimulation of the purple and green layers. The alternative theory, which is that of Hering, assumes that the colour-sense proper can be best accounted for by assuming the existence in the retina of two sensitive layers, each of which shall be subject to modification in two opposed directions by a corresponding pair of contrast colours. On this system, therefore, we obtain four fundamental colours—green, red, blue, and yellow 1 —the first two and the last two of these being associated together in pairs. The phenomena which lead to the assumption of this association of the fundamental colours in pairs are, primarily, the facts connected with colour-after-images, and further the fact that the colours which constitute a pair of contrast colours mutually neutralise each other and combine to form an element of colourless light. e find as a consequence that no colour in Nature can be seen as both red and green at the same time, while, on the other hand, a green may be a blue-green or a yellow-green, and a red either a yellow-red or a blue-red. The same principle holds, of course, with respect to the other pair of contrast colours, the laundress, for instance, availing herself of it freely to make her clothes white by adding blue to neu tralise the yellow they contain. Neither of these two theories of colour-vision has as yet received the general acceptance of physiologists. In point of fact, the language of either theory accommodates itself readily enough to the expression of the more obvious phenomena associated with colour-vision, and with regard to these we could hardly say that the one theory supplies us with a simpler explanation than the other does. ^ hen, howevei, we pass on from the region of the well-established phenomena to those of a more subtle observation, we find each theory being put forward in its turn as the only one in which adequate provision is made for the incorporation of the more recondite phenomena of colour-sense which had not yet been elicited at the time when the theory was originally brought forward. The facts which would turn the scale in these cases in favour of the 1 Herring's hypothesis assumes the existence of two other contrast colours, black and white, in addition to the four here enumerated. For our present purposes we may, however, leave this last pair of contrast colours entirely out of consideration.650 THE NINETEENTH April one or the other theory, however, contain so large a subjective element that it is a matter of great difficulty for an observer who, as it often happens, has not an opportunity of verifying them for himself, to make quite certain of the degree of objectivity which he will be justified in attributing to them. here the observations in question serve the purposes of the competing theory the observei, being merely human, will naturally be doubly cautious in accepting them, and thus we easily see how the strife of the theories comes to be still in progress. In spite of the difficulties in the way of making a choice, it is obviously necessary for us to make an election of a theory in order to have a language in which to put on record the facts which have been elicited with regard to colour-blindness. We cannot discuss the subject without, for instance, making up our minds, at least in a provisional manner, as to whether we are to regard blue as a funda mental colour or as a mixture of purple and green elements. On the whole, we shall perhaps find that the language of Hering's theory will lend itself best to the expression of the facts with which we shall have to deal, and we shall therefore do well to follow the fortunes of the contrast-colour hypothesis and to endeavour to see the colour-world, as far as may be, through the spectacles of the genial Professor of Physiology in the German University of Prague. When we now come to consider the question of colour-blindness from the point of view of the theory of contrast colours, we see that the ' bookish theorick' of the matter would dispose us to expect to find three distinct varieties of colour-blindness. We should evidently ex pect to find, first, a complete form of colour-blindness in which external objects should appear as in a photograph, and should be distinguish able only by their differences of form and by differences of illumina tion. We should further expect to find two partial forms of colour blindness in which there should be an absence or defect in reacting power in sometimes one and sometimes the other of the hypothetical retinal layers. We should, in a word, expect to find a red-green blind ness in which external objects should be distinguishable, not only by differences of form and illumination, as in complete colour-blindness, but in addition by differences in blue and yellow colouring. Similarly, we should expect to meet with a parallel phenomenon in the form of a yellow-blue blindness, in which differences in the distribution of green and red should be the only appreciable colour-distinctions. These would be the theoretical deductions, and we have now to see whether they are borne out by actual observations on the colour blind. We now find the facts concerning these to be as follows. First, a complete form of colour-blindness has been met with, but it is of almost phenomenally rare occurrence. Further, with respect to the varieties of incomplete colour-blindness, we find that yellow- blue colour-blindness is unknown (independently, of course, of the1892 COL 0UR-BLINDNESS 651 occurrence of absolute colour-blindness). On the other hand, the form of colour-blindness which is so commonly met with is in every case a green-red colour-blindness. 2 It is thus evident that the facts are in substantial harmony with the requirements of the theory, and we can also see that we may, for all practical purposes, confine ourselves to the consideration of the particular variety of partial colour-blindness which we shall call red- green colour-blindness. This colour-blindness would, in Hering's view, not be a condition in which the eye is insensitive to either green or red, but rather a condition in which the eye is blind to that distinction between red and green rays which comes as a matter of course to the normal eye. This - view of the nature of colour-blindness is based upon observa tions which were made by Hering in connection with the optical phe nomenon known either simply as ' colour-shadows,' or more commonly as ' Hering's colour-shadows,' in consequence of the important im provements in the methods of demonstrating them which were introduced by that physiologist. The phenomenon itself has, how ever, been long known, and Goethe, for instance, experimented upon the subject with a lead-pencil, and the shadows which were cast from it by his candle and the full moon at his window. The principle involved in the production of colour-shadows is, that if we have two sources of light placed so that the rays emanating from them shall be incident in the same plane upon any opaque object which is placed to intercept their rays, two contiguous shadows will be cast on a background of, let us say, a sheet of white paper. If, now, the light from the one source is a coloured light (we may assume for the sake of fixing our ideas that it is a blue light we are dealing with), while the light from the other source is a white light of somewhat comparable— i .e. of duly diminished—intensity, the portion of the paper which is screened off from the white light will, under these circumstances, naturally come out of a relatively saturated blue. So much might have been expected On the other hand, it is at first somewhat startling to find that the companion shadow from which the blue light is screened off by the intercepting body comes out a yellow which is quite comparable in intensity to the brilliancy of the blue shadow. In the same way, a red light would have induced the contrast green on the companion shadow, and, vice versa, a yellow would have induced a blue, and a green a 2 The faculty of distinguishing between red and green is for many reasons nssnmed to be less primitive than the faculty of distinguishing between blue and yellow. This view is based on the fact that the power of making the distinction between red and green is limited to the central area of the retina, while yellow can be distinguished from blue in any part of the field. Further, it is based on the fact that the faculty is not unfrequently congenitally absent. Lastly, it is based on the fact that it may be lost either by accidental injury to the eyes, or, as we have seen, by the abuse of drugs.652 THE NINETEENTH April red. Again, when we combine these, a greenish-blue would induce a reddish-yellow on the companion shadow, and so on. The causation of these phenomena 3 is, as may well be imagined, extremely obscure, arid it has no very direct bearing upon the par ticular question of colour-vision which we are discussing. The colour-shadows themselves are, however, of extreme interest to us as pointing to an association between red and green, and blue and yellow, respectively, and they supply us with an invaluable means of testing for colour-defects in colour-vision, inasmuch as it is possible by the use of Hering's shutter apparatus to obtain two conterminous colour-shadows illuminated respectively with practically pure red and green, and also perfectly equalised with respect to illumination. The conterminous colour-shadows thus obtained naturally appear to the normal-sighted as quite distinct, by virtue of the fact that the one is green while the other is red. To the colour-blind, on the other hand, the conterminous shadows appear as one as soon as all the differences in illumination have been equalised, and all differences in blue and yellow colouring have been corrected. It thus becomes evident that the distinction between red and green is non-existent for the colour-blind. If, however, we were to fail to correct, or to introduce, any trace of yellow or blue into one of the colour-shadows, the contrast blue or yellow would immediately make its appearance in the companion shadow, and a difference which is appreciable by the colour-blind person would be established. Similarly, any small difference in illumination between the shadows would be immediately noticed. It is thus shown that the colour-blind are properly character ised as green-red blind, and that their powers of vision are, in other respects, unimpeachable. If it were not for this twofold means of discrimination between objects of similar form which is retained by the colour-blind, no colour-blind person could escape detection for an instant. As a matter of fact, we, however, find that the discrimination power in the colour-blind is so adequate for all ordinary purposes that their defect in colour-sense is seldom detected unless where it is specially examined for. How adequate the discrimination power of the colour blind really is for all ordinary purposes is, however, perhaps best 3 The phenomenon of the colour-shadows can be easily demonstrated by using any window in which we have a pane of coloured glass. It is only necessary to darken the whole of the window, with the exception of a narrow strip of the coloured pane and a similar strip of the contiguous clearer ground-glass pane. A ruler or lath is then to be held up perpendicularly in such a position that the clear and the coloured windows may cast contiguous shadows from it upon a piece of white paper. The clear window is then to be darkened by gradually covering it over, from the top or from the side, with a piece of cardboard until it admits only as much light as the coloured pane. The shadow thrown by the coloured window will then come out of the contrast colour to the coloured window and to its companion-shadow, from which the colourless light is screened olf.1892 COLOUR-BLINDNESS 653 l)roug]it out by the fact that, though a not inappreciable fraction of mankind have been colour-blind, our first description of the condition dates only from the last century, when John Dalton discovered, and then only after years of self-observation, that red and green were names for sensations which had no existence for him. It is, on the other hand, true that a colour-blind person is sometimes in ordinary life at a dis advantage as compared with a person with normal colour-sense. He is at a somewhat serious disadvantage, for instance, when he is set down to pick strawberries in a garden, for the ripe bluish-red straw berries play a kind of game of hide and seek with him among the bluish-green leaves which, as we have seen, must be of indistinguish- ably the same colour to him. In the ordinary method of testing for colour-blindness by means of Holmgren's wools^the oculist avails him self of colour-mixtures which are quite comparable to these in order to place the colour-blind at a disadvantage. Having thus obtained, it is hoped, the beginnings of a true under standing of colour-blindness, we have to continue our inquiry by endeavouring to arrive at some kind of a notion of what the colour- blind really see where we see ordinary green and red. In order to do this we shall have to begin by a preliminary analysis of our every-day colour-sensations. In point of fact, we find when we attend to the matter that our familiar sensation of, for instance, red and green can be resolved into three component sensations, which become agglomerated together in our minds into a single sensation simply in consequence of the fact of their being simultaneously received on the retina. We have, first, a sensation of white or colourless light, which, as it were, dilutes the green or red, and converts it into what is technically known as ' unsaturated colour.' We have further in every ordinary green and red (for we are not dealing with theoretically pure colours) an element of either blue or yellow. And, lastly, we have the residual and essential element of the sensation, which in strictness is the only element denoted by the term ' red' or ' green.' We have already dealt with the first two elements in the complex sensation in their relation to colour-blindness, and we have seen that the colour-blind are entirely competent with regard to them. Our present task is, therefore, limited to endeavouring to elicit what the single undifferentiated sensation is which corresponds in the colour blind to the dual red and green sensations of the normal-sighted. In other words, we have to seek to arrive at the connotation which the colour-blind attach indiscriminately to the terms green and red. This is evidently an almost impossible task, but we may perhaps note a few facts which will enable us to arrive at some notions on this very difficult subject. To begin with, it has been ascertained that a colour-blind person is not blind to a red element intermixed with another colour, in at all the same way as if he were really p a blind person. Neither, V ol. XXXI —No. 182 Y Ythe nineteenth April on tlie other hand, does lie see an equivalent of white or colourless light for what we see as coloured light. Rather he sees a something which is not to us at present fully intelligible, and which indeed will never be thoroughly understood by us unless it should turn out to be possible to induce a similar condition of colour-blindness artificially in ourselves. What the colour-blind person does see in these cases is described byDalton—who, it will be remembered, was himself colour blind—as a neutral tint, and that seems almost as far as we can go in the matter of defining the colour. We can, however, gather with a certain amount of probability that this neutral tint, when it occurs either isolated or in combina tion with yellow or blue, can be distinguished by the colour-blind from either grey or an admixture of grey with other colours. This is, however, only an inference from the fact that a majority at least of the colour-blind seem, when they are dealing with greens or reds, to be in some way apprised of the fact that they are dealing with colours of which the further discrimination ought to be possible to them. It is probably some such vague feeling of incompetence in the matter of resolving them which seems to render particular shades of colour positively disagreeable to certain colour-blind people. It has, for instance, been noticed in connection with a certain eminent colour-blind mathematician that he invariably proceeds, as soon as he sits down to his table, to cover up and hide out of sight, 4 as disagreeable,' any books which may happen to be bound in a particular, to the normal-sighted perfectly unobjectionable, shade of green. We can perhaps succeed in placing ourselves to some extent at his standpoint in this matter by fixing our eyes steadily upon some bright or red or green object—let us say, upon a square of red paper—and then awaiting the appearance of the after-image. We must, however, for our present purposes beware of looking for the after-image in the ordinary manner either by closing our eyes, or by directing them away to vacancy, when we should of course see the after-image of a green square, with which Pears's advertisements must have thoroughly familiarised the readers of English magazines of some few years back. We have instead to keep our eyes fixed rigidly upon the red paper, and we shall soon find that one after image will appear to us there. It is in this connection necessary for us to realise that the after-image does not, as one might at first suppose, spring suddenly into being in the instant in which the eyes are removed from the paper. Eather, as Hering has shown, it begins to come into existence as soon as our eyes are directed to the object, and it then gradually works 4 its way up to our consciousness, through a retina which is becoming more receptive to its influence. Thus, in our present experiment, the after-image of green will, as it 4 This workirg its way throiigh of a sensory phenomenon to consciousness while1892 COLOUR-BLINDNESS 655 rises up to us through the red of the primary image, make the red square appear greyer and greyer until we shall at last feel that we can hardly tell whether the paper before us is indeed grey or red or green. When the experiment has been pushed to this stage, and red and green have grown indistinguishable to us, we have a sense of having lost foothold, and our red square begins to become uncanny to us, with, we may imagine, something of the uncanniness that the green books have for our colour-blind mathematician. We may here, perhaps, note incidentally that over-sensitiveness of after-image re sponse in the green and red would entail a fogging of these colours, and thus explain many of the phenomena of colour-blindness. Having thus seen what, upon Hering's theory, would appear to be the true nature of colour-blindness, we must now proceed to deal with the objections which have been urged against the construction which this contrast-colour theory puts upon the facts. The first of these objections is based upon observations which tend to show that the field of the retina which sees green is rather more restricted than the field of the retina which perceives red. It may be remarked in explanation that it is a well-established fact of physiology that red and green are distinguished, roughly speaking, only upon the cen tral portions of the retina, while the discrimination power between yellow and blue is carried well up to the periphery. We have to notice, with respect to this objection, that any ascer tained defect in coincidence in the retinal fields for red and green would be immediately fatal to Hering's hypothesis of the association of these two colour-perceptions with a single retinal layer, while it would, of course, go some way to support the Young-Helmholtz theory, in which, it will be remembered, provision is made for separate retinal mechanisms for the registration of red and green. In view of the importance of the subject, the observations upon which this objection was based were carefully repeated by Professor Hering, and it appears to result from his re-examination of the question that the retinal fields for red and green are, in point of fact, strictly con terminous, and that the assertion of the contrary is to be accounted for only by the assumption that the experiments which gave the con tradictory result were conducted with red pigments which contained an element of yellow, by virtue of which they could still be recognised as coloured by the remoter peripheral portions of the retina. it is^all along gradually modifying the ('somatic') ego in the direction of a fuller sus ceptibility to its influence, finds an almost perfect expression in Dante's ' guardando, una sola parvenza, ' Mutandom' io, a me si travagliava.'— Par. xxxiii. 113, 114. I have elsewhere {Jour.of Anat. and Phy Jan. 1892) suggested that the restful- ness of all shades of green may possibly be explained by the fact that the light which bathes the retina is always coloured blood-red, owing to the position of the retinal vessels in front of the retina. Green, as the physiological contrast colour, would therefore always come with a sense of relief.THE NINETEENTH CEN April The second objection which has been taken to Hering's theory deals more particularly with the phenomena of colour-blindness. 'W e shall see that it is based upon a very careful study of these pheno mena which has elicited that there are two varieties of the common colour-blindness with which we have been occupying ourselves. It is now asserted that in one of these varieties of colour-blindness the defect in vision consists in an inability to see reds, while m the other variety there is a similar incapacity to distinguish green colours. These forms of colour-blindness have, therefore, been designated re spectively as ' green-blindness' and 'red-blindness.' We can appreciate at once how these designations have in course of the controversy proved a tower of strength to the defenders of the Young-Helmholtz hypothesis. Here now, at any rate, there seemed to the onlookers to be some flaw in the Hering theory of colour-blindness, for that theory asserts the ordinary colour-blind to be all equaUy green- and red-blind, and to belong essentially to a single category. To Professor Hering it seemed, however, to be plain that, if there were differences which allowed of the colour-blind being sorted into two classes, those dif ferences must, in all probability, depend upon some differences in the susceptibility to yellow and blue light on the part of those whom his theory pronounced to be both red- and green-blind, further^ he argued that these differences, if they actually occurred, 'would probably not be limited to the colour-blind, but might be expected to occur also in the normal-sighted. In order to put this view to the test. Professor Hering undertook a series of observations upon three normal-sighted persons—namely, upon himself, and upon his two assistants. Dr. Biedermann and Dr. Stilling. These experiments were designed to elicit whether any constant differences could be detected in the colour judgments of the three normal-sighted persons who were the subject of experiment. The question proposed for judgment was the determination of the point at which a red, which was graduated off on the one side into a blue-red and on the other into a yellow-red, could be regarded as at the neutral point at which it did not incline either to the one or other of these colours. When the matter was put to the experimental test in this manner, constant differences were actually discovered to obtain between the judgments of the three individual observers. The one observer, Dr. (now Prof.) Biedermann, in all cases still continued to see a yellowish tinge when the red proposed for judgment had already, in the judgment of the other two observers, long ceased to contain any trace of yellow. Similarly, when it was a question of transition from a blue-red to a pure red, the blue faded out from the red first to Dr. Biedermann, next to Prof. Hering, and last of all to Dr. Stilling. In fact. Dr. Biedermann had regularly begun to see a yellow shade in the red before it had well ceased to have a blue shade for Dr. Stilling.1892 COLOUR-BLINDNESS 657 Prof. Hering was ascertained to occupy a kind of intermediate position in respect of his susceptibility to yellow and blue rays. It thus became evident that there are physiological differences of sensibility to the blue and yellow rays to be found in persons of per fectly normal sight, and Professor Hering was able to show, by means of an ingenious method of experimentation with excised retinas, that such differences were not referable to any disparity of colour nomen clature, while they might quite well be accounted for by individual differences in the depth of pigmentation over the central region, the so-called macula lutea, or yellow spot of the retina. It was pointed out by Hering that an increased depth of pigmentation would naturally entail a greater absorption of the bluish rays during their transmission to the deeper-lying sensitive layer of the retina, and further that the result of such an excessive weeding out of the blue rays would be to give every colour judgment which emanated from a person with a deeply pigmented retina a distinct yellowish bias. This we have seen was the condition which was found to obtain in the case of Dr. Biedermann's colour judgments. On the other hand, the colour judgments of a person whose retina contained less than the average of pigment would be characterised by a bluish bias, for the light which would to the ordinary eye appear as colourless would to such an eye appear to be bluish, owing to a less than average elimination of the blue rays. Having realised these facts, we have now to follow Professor Hering's application of them to the explanation of the differences which obtain among the colour-blind. We saw that the colour-blind had, by the advocates of the Helmholtz hypothesis, been classified •upon the basis of certain differences into a class of green-blind persons and into a class of red-blind. We have now, however, to see /that the differences which are designated by these ' question-begging epithets' really resolve themselves into merely physiological variations in retinal pigmentation which come in and modify the always essen tially red-green blindness in either of two opposite senses. It will thus, upon this view, only be an accident of excessive or deficient retinal pigmentation which will determine a particular colour-blind person to one or other of these categories, while the great majority /of the colour-blind will follow the and will not fit into either category. Green-blindness would, upon this basis, be explain- .able as merely our ordinary green-red colour-blindness occurring in a person who belonged in the matter of retinal pigmentation to the Biedermann or deeply pigmented type, while red-blindness would be the same condition occurring in a person who happened to resemble Dr. Stilling in having a retina with less than an average amount of pigment. We must, however, here take into consideration the fact that reds as well as yellows would be at an advantage in passing through a deeply pigmented retina, while not only blues but greens658 THE NINETEENTH April would in such cases be discriminated against. In the condition of deeply pigmented retina, blue-green would, therefore, be the most difficult colour to recognise, because of the excessive elimination of these rays during transmission, and in this manner we might, if it were worth while, constitute a sub-class of the green- blind. Similarly, we might constitute another sub-class of red-blind by grouping together all the colour-blind persons whose maculse transmitted more than an average of blue-green rays. We must remember that the transmission of an excess of blue-green rays would act as a set-off against the yellow-red rays, and would thus, by neutralising their colour-properties, render these rays proportionately difficult to appreciate. With this we appear to have reached a stage in our study of colour-blindness at which it would perhaps be justifiable to feel a certain amount of confidence in the contrast-colour hypothesis theory as, at any rate, a good working hypothesis. We may therefore,, perhaps, now venture to approach the practical question of the pre vention of accidents from colour-blindness, with some practical proposals. To begin with, we have to keep a firm hold of the fact that there is no case of yellow-blue blindness on record. We have also to keep before us the fact that the green-red colour-blind find their way through life very comfortably with their single pair of colour- perceptions, and with their power of distinguishing differences of illumination, and that they exploit these to an extent which we hardly realise in the discrimination of colours which the normal- sighted discriminate more naturally by differences in the reds and the greens. Now when a colour-blind person is to be tested in a scientific manner to elicit the defect in his colour-sense, it is a matter of duty to propose to him the solution of the only question which his defect of colour-sense absolutely incapacitates him from solving. We, therefore, as has been explained, set him down to discriminate between red and greens from which we have designedly eliminated all differences of illumination, and of blue or yellow colouration. He naturally falls into the trap we have laid for him, and we proceed then to reject him for railway- or sea-employment, without reference to the fact that the problems there proposed to him for solution may be quite within his competence. This defect in our methods of examination has, it is true, been to some extent remedied by the so-called ' practical tests'— i.e. by proposing to a candidate for employment the solution of the actual problems which he will be required to solve in the course of his work. This method of testing cannot, and indeed does not, pretend to be a scientific system of testing for colour-blindness ; for though we do in point of fact ask the candidate to distinguish between red and green, we allow him to undertake the discrimination entirely by his1892 COLOUR-BLINDNESS 659 own methods, and a mere glance at the signal lamps of almost any of our railways, or at the side lights of our ships, will show that the dis crimination between the red and the green which are employed would be within the competence of anyone who could see a difference between blue and yellow. As a matter of fact, we find the red glass which is brought into requisition has a very appreciable tinge of yellow, and the green has almost as pronounced a shade of blue. These differences, which put the discrimination of the lights within the competence of the colour-blind, are, however, probably due rather to an accident of convenience of manufacture than to any scientific intention, for it will be noticed that the coloured glass employed in omnibuses and cab lamps generally conforms to the same type. When we have once realised how the discrimination between the red and the green of the signal lights .comes to be under present con ditions within the competence (though of course often only very iiarrowly within the competence) of the colour-blind, we see that it would be possible to put a stop to many of the accidents which still creep in under our present system of examinations, by taking the precaution of bringing the signal colours in all cases comfortably within the competence of the colour-blind, by providing that a dis tinct orange should replace the red which is now in use, and that a more pronounced shade of blue should be introduced into the green of the signals. In that case, we might perhaps be able to dispense with our colour-vision examinations. We must remember that we can never be perfectly safe against accidents which are due to colour-blindness by any system of admis sion examinations, and this for two reasons. First, because colour blindness is not necessarily congenital, but may originate, as we have seen, at any time. Secondly, because it is at all times difficult in testing for colour-blindness to be quite certain that the colour-blind person will not evade detection by appreciating some accidental difference of illumination, or of blue and yellow colouring which we may have failed to notice in the colour-vision tests we are proposing to him. We have seen that the ' practical tests' open the door wide to such a contingency. If we, then, upon the basis of a series of successful discriminations, pronounce an examinee to be free from defects of colour-sense, we admit him to employment where, in the existing condition of things, the differences between the signal lights are to him of so subtle a character that some fine day, when perhaps the conditions of light are unfavourable to him, he may fail to make the discrimination and a catastrophe ensues. There are two ways in which this condition of things could be remedied. The first would be by the installation of yellow and blue as signal colours in the place of red and green. This substitution would, from the point of view of the theory of colour-vision, evidently be the ideally perfect one, since we should then be employing for signal purposes colours660 THE NINETEENTH April with, regard to wMcli colour-blindness simply does not exist. This change would, however, evidently be a very revolutionary one, and there may very conceivably be practical reasons with respect to visi bility from a distance, or in foggy weather, which would militate against such an alteration. The second proposal, which is in its essence the same as the first suggestion, is the proposal which has been made above, and which may probably enough prove to be a feasible one. This suggestion is, that provision should be made that the red employed in signals shall be in all cases a distinct yellowish, red and that the green shall be an equally distinct blue green. If, as seems probable, these distinctions in yellow and blue can be made plain enough to provide for the ready discrimination of the signals even in the most aggravated cases of colour-blindness, we might evidently dis pense altogether with colour-vision examinations. If, on the other hand, they cannot be made plain enough for the aggravatedly colour blind to appreciate, they ought at any rate to be introduced every where as a precaution against accidents from slight or incipient colour-blindness which may have escaped detection. In all accidents which may occur, where the accident is attributed to colour-blindness, it is evident that attention ought to be paid to the question, whether the ready discrimination of the signals by their yellows and blues has been properly provided for. A. E. W right,1892 661 AUSTRIAN ST Any traveller with an eye for a horse cannot fail to be struck with the number of well-bred, well-shaped, smart-looking animals that he sees in the fiacres in the streets of Vienna, and should he try a drive in the Prater, he is no less surprised at the pace at which they go. Perhaps the impression is specially strong after gazing at the mis shapen brutes that one sees in some of the German towns ; but, •coming straight back from Vienna to London, and looking at the smartest hansom horses, one must admit that the Austrian hack horses -are a wonderfully good lot. To discuss why it is that they are so, or to go into the whole history -of Austrian horse-breeding, would be beyond my powers. I simply propose to give a traveller's impressions of a visit to the two largest (xovernment studs in the Austro-Hungarian kingdom—impressions noted down at the time, but formed without the wholesome corrective of a friend with whom to discuss them. I cannot find that much is known in England about the special studs I visited, as at Mezohegyes, near Arad in Hungary, in the Visitors' Book the only two English names I could trace were those of General Keith Eraser, when he was military attache at Vienna, and Mr. Ernest Clarke, the Secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, to whom we are indebted for an interesting article in the Royal ouvncd on Agricultural Administration in Austria-Hungary. While at Radautz, I could not learn of any recent inspection of the stud by an Englishman. The journey from Buda-Pesth to Mezohegyes is very like all railway journeys in Hungary. Travelling in rather stuffy carriages, with a large dining car attached, shut the window as you will, every thing on your plate is soon covered with Hungarian dust. The country is perfectly flat, as far as the eye can reach, with here and there villages in the distance, and little houses dotted over the fields. These invariably have a small white oven in close proximity to the doorway, and rarely possess a chimney, so that some writer stated ■that the Hungarian peasants had no chimneys in their houses, the fact being that they build little houses on their patches of land.662 THE NINETEENTH April where they reside in spring and summer, in order to sow and reap their crops, returning to the villages for the winter months, when probably the snow would make residence on these lands impossible^ There was little variation in the scene until Szegedin was reached, where I had an enforced stay from four o'clock in the afternoon until three o'clock the following morning. It was interesting as a specimen of an entirely new Hungarian town, having been, with the exception of a few houses, swept away by the flooding of the Eiver Theiss in 18/9, and entirely rebuilt on the latest Hungarian ideas, to house a popula tion of some 75,000. The town, with its modern buildings and parks and gardens, looks slightly out of keeping with its inhabitants, and I met a strangely mixed crowd on the promenade near the river bank, listening to the band, from ragged workmen just returning from the fields to pretty Jewesses in smart frocks. As far as I could see, Szegedin is chiefly remarkable for the number of pretty women that are to be seen there, the amount of cayenne pepper that is grown in its environs, and by far the best Hungarian band I ever listened to. From Szegedin to Mezohegyes my journey was without incident, but my visit there I can never forget, both from its varied interests and the extreme kindness with which I was received by the Hungarian officers and officials in charge, who vied with each other in trying to show me everything in the pleasantest possible manner. To describe Mezohegyes, the chief stud and Grovernment farm in Hungary, I must ask the reader to imagine what is really a little principality, having at one end the railway station, excellent hotel, post office, church, hospital, schools, beet-sugar factory, residences of the manager and chief officials, officers' quarters, fine roomy stables for stud stallions, stores, forges, yards full of the most modern machinery, carpenters' shops, and rows of neat white cottages for the workmen, with every evidence of comfort and industry. Let him picture a flat of rich Hungarian land some 60,000 acres in extent,, surrounded by a belt of trees on its frontier, with the State railway running through its centre, with a field railway to various convenient points, with a telephone to eighteen different stations, electric light, a canal bringing water from the marshes of Arad at a distance of some thirty kilometres, water that is wanted not only to supply the community, but also to wash and whirl the sugar beet that is tumbled down into a quickly-flowing stream into the factory, and to flood the natural meadows, with some thirty plantations, varying in size from forty or fifty to two hundred acres, acting as shelter-belts to break the force of the cyclones, which are often very violent, with long; wide avenues miles in length, running perfectly straight from point to point, with fairly good trees on either side, with farm buildings, granaries with specially convenient elevators, cattle yards and stables.1892 AUSTRIAN ST 663^ and the workmen's houses and soldiers' quarters dotted about in different positions, all white and roofed with wooden shingle, all well kept and eminently practical. In the yards long narrow wooden sheds for storing maize, and in each the invariable well, with its long transverse pole for lowering the bucket, with no attempt at roads anywhere, and a hard-beaten, perfectly flat, dusty surface, with, in some of the huge fields, crops of beet and maize being gathered. In others, hundreds of big cream-coloured Hungarian bullocks ploughing six in a yoke, or resting round their waggons and eating their mid day feed; in others, steam-ploughs at work, ploughing for the beet- crop, which requires deep cultivation ; in others the steam-threshing machine, with such huge stacks of straw as we never see in England in others herds of long-legged woolly pigs in charge of a swineherd, who, with his long whip, seems to have but little on but a loose white shirt and petticoat, in picturesque contrast to his bronzed arms and legs, or the equally long-legged sheep, which are hard at first in the distance to distinguish from the pigs ; and last, and best of all, the herds of beautiful mares guarded by their mounted soldier chicos : and all this under a cloudless sky, with flocks of peewits and carrion crows flying about, and now and then an eagle suddenly dropping from the sky close to you and then floating off again, and on the ground the little marmots sitting up to see what you are, and dis appearing like magic into their holes—and he has the best descrip tion I can give of Mezohegyes. Before coming to the horses, of which there are about 2,300, I shall try to give some idea of the scale on which farming operations; are here conducted. I was informed that, in addition to the herds of pure-bred Hungarian cattle, there are 2,700 working bullocks, 12,000. sheep, 7,000 pigs, 28 steam-threshing machines, and every thing else on a similar scale; that there are nearly 10,000 men, women, and children to whom employment is given, 2,400 of that number coming from the north of Hungary for the summer's work and returning to their homes in winter. These men receive free lodging and 75 kreuzers a day in wages, from which o5 kreuzers are deducted for the food which is supplied to them, and their working hours are from 5 a.m . to 6 p.m ., with an interval of a quarter of an hour at 7 and an hour from 12 to 1 for dinner. The labourers of all classes work in gangs of from twenty-five to thirty under an overseer. The horses in this huge establishment are, as is invariably the case in all studs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, under military control. There is a regular staff of rittmeisters, veterinary surgeons, and subalterns and soldiers, some 237 in all, under the- commandant, who is responsible at Mezohegyes to the Hungarian- Minister of Agriculture, Count Kosmar.664 THE NINETEENTH April This stud was formed in the year 1785, and the mares that were put to the haras were in the first instance selected more from their shape and form, and some special excellence that they had shown in the army, than from their breeding. Since then, a most careful record of the pedigrees has been kept, and gradually certain families have been established possessing specially good points and strong charac teristics. The object of the stud is to improve the breed of horses in the country. All the best animals that are bred in the stud are kept for stud purposes, and there is a regular drafting each year, so that the stud is kept up to the highest state of perfection. Also in each year 200 of the best colts that can be found in the country are pur chased from the big landowners and others, the best being kept as sires, and the others sold as geldings. The stallions may be divided into— 1. For stud purposes. These number nineteen, of which nine are thoroughbred English and ten half-bred. Among the thoroughbreds were some nice, useful, compact-looking horses, with good records as to racing, but I was not so much struck with them as with the half- bred stallions, five of which were remarkably good, strong, on short legs, with good shoulders, good action, excellent feet, and good behind the saddle, their chief fault being a little coarseness in the head and Jaw. They must produce a good stamp of horses, and Hungarians now seem to aim very much at size and strength. All these stallions are ridden out for exercise two hours each morning, and seem per fectly quiet. 2. Those that are let out to private proprietors, who pay from 300 to 800 florins a season for them. 3. Those that are stationed at the military stations scattered all over the country, and are let at fees varying from 2 to 5 florins ; and 4. Those that are sold to the communes. Of the second and third classes, some 2,700 Mezohegyes stallions •are standing at various stations at the low fees I have given, two florins being more often paid than anything higher. I saw a hundred of these stallions standing in one stable with nothing but a swinging pole between each horse, and was greatly struck with their appearance, and the fact that every horse I had out, some twenty in number, ■seemed to have really good action. These were all going out to sta tions this year. I then went into a similar stable where the stallions for the communes were standing. These were three-year-old stallions with a label up at the end of each stall, giving the horse s pedigree and price. The price is fixed by the Minister (Kosmar) at a figure very much below the horse's real value. Representatives from the communes come to inspect the horses, make their choice, and pay down a quarter of the price, which1892 AUSTRIAN ST 665 is never altered, before taking the horse away, and the balance in three annual instalments. Also, if the horse turns out to be useless, or suffering from any malady, it can be changed. This privilege is said to be very much valued by the communes, who invariably buy up all the horses, and never make any default in the payment, which they have small reason to do if I may judge from the quality of the horses I saw placed at their disposal at ridiculously low prices, varying from 300 to 450 florins each. Several horses are often purchased by the same commune; and as near Mezohegyes one commune consists of 40,000 inhabitants, who own some 27,000 horses, this is not to be wondered at. The mares are generally kept in groups, or what is termed a haras of about 100 mares each, guarded by mounted soldier chicos when turned out in the plains. I inspected four of these groups—the first a lot of dark chestnut mares all very much the same colour and height (15.3), called ' Gidrans,' from the founder of their race, a pure-bred Arab, his progeny again being crossed with English thoroughbreds, so that these mares are Anglo- Arabs. They are a particularly well-matched, good-looking lot of fine, well-bred, hunter-like mares, with, considering their breeding, great bone and substance, and are said to produce excellent chargers noted for their good temper. The next lot I saw were Anglo-Norman mares descended from a stallion named Nonius, imported from France in 1815, his progeny being crossed with English stallions. These mares were from sixteen to seventeen hands high, chiefly browns and bays, and were said to produce very fine carriage-horses, selling up to 3,200 florins a pair; but though they showed great bone and substance, I confess that many of them appeared to me too long in the back and ungainly in appearance, with coarse heads, and they were the lot I cared least about. Another lot, the small Nonius, descended from the same sire originally, but the smallest mares being picked out and crossed with small English thoroughbreds were much more pleasing to look at, and were a very compact, even, well-matched, useful-looking lot, standing about fifteen hands high. The last group were descended from a Hungarian horse called Furioso, his progeny being crossed with half-bred and thoroughbred English stallions, but notably with an English thoroughbred. North Star. I then inspected the young horses. All are most carefully kept in their special class, and in lots of from 65 to 100 together, in long loose houses with big straw yards attached 5 and fiom the three-year- old stallions to the colts and fillies of this year, all are the same gentle beasts; you can walk and push your way among them with perfect impunity, handle and pick up their legs, and in fact, whether in the plains or in the loose houses, you can do exactly what you like'666 THE NINETEENTH April with them, the chicos leading them anywhere with their whips round the horses' necks. All the time I was in the country I only saw one animal attempt to kick viciously, and she was an old Lippitzaner mare known to be untrustworthy. Attached to these long loose houses are stables for the chicos' riding horses, and saddle and sleeping rooms for the men. Everything is done with the greatest system; the animals are groomed every morn ing, tied while eating their corn, and those that eat quickly or those that eat slowly or require extra feeding are put together; in fact, the character of each animal is studied and known. With each lot a donkey is kept to accustom them to donkeys, of which there are many in the country, and they all have three hours' exercise a day in the large yards in winter, when the snow renders exercise in the plains impossible, during one hour of which they are made to trot. The young horses were especially good, and I should say that an improvement in the horses is taking place each year from the im mense care that is taken with the breeding. With regard to the mares, I was greatly struck with their apparent soundness, all having clean hard legs measuring well below the knee, and good feet, all, of course, unshod; and I cannot recall a mare in which any unsoundness was visible. The pleasant Hungarian officer who accompanied me all the time, and whose knowledge of the indi viduality of each animal was marvellous, told me that they only breed from perfectly sound mares and stallions ; that a certain number of old mares are weeded out for sale each year, and some young mares put in their place, that these are taken in and broken to ride and drive at three and a half years old, but are not served until four years old, and that they prefer the mares to foal in November or December. Both mares and stallions may be called on at any time to do any kind of work. The young horses that are not kept for the stud are sold each year at auctions in Buda-Pesth, in the beginning of October, at four and a half years old; they are trained to ride and drive, and are guaranteed sound : if any defect should exist, the full particulars are given by the auctioneer. Every animal in the stud is branded with two marks and a number, which show what horse it was got by and its dam's breed ing, so that the breeding of every animal that comes from this and other Government studs can be told at once by the initiated. This Grovernment mark is a blemish in the eyes of foreign dealers, but is much valued in Hungary, where the good breeds are well known and their characteristics so strongly marked that it is generally easy to recognise the special breed to which any horse belongs. Last year the horses from Mezohegyes averaged 860 florins, and this year,1892 AUSTRIAN ST FARMS 667 judging from those I saw sold at the Buda-Pesth TattersaU's, I should gay that the average was about the same.- I was fortunate in being present at these sales after my visit to Mezohegyes, and saw some excellent hacks, harness horses, and chargers sold at from 500 to 800 florins, some going up as high as 1,600 florins. I can see no reason why some of these animals should not make hunters, though it is possible they may not possess inherited powers of jumping; they certainly have the makes, and shapes, and powers of going and staying to an extraordinary degree, but an English dealer who was there grumbled sorely about the Government mark. The auction is carried on entirely by the Government with a military auctioneer, who repeats the bidding in both German and the Magyar tongue. The Minister, Kosmar, standing down in the ring practically controls the sale, and many a short knock was given when the bidder hap pened to be an officer. The big ring, round which the horses can gallop, and the strongly marked Jewish type of the dealers, make this sale different from any I have seen in our own country; and I was told that if an Hungarian noble wishes to purchase a horse, even from his neighbour, he generally employs the omnipresent Jew to make the bargain. Eadautz is so totally different to Mezohegyes that it would be unfair to compare them ; and when, after a slow but interesting—and, owing to the Zone system, a very cheap—journey through Galicia, one arrives in Bukovina, among her swarthy black-haired peasants, with their long hair and sad expressionless faces, and the keen-eyed cadaverous-looking, orthodox Jews, with their greasy ringlets and long alpaca garments, it almost seems like another world. In some respects not a pleasant world, when one is mixed up too closely with its inhabitants in a crowded railway station, as nowhere have I ex perienced such pungent garlic, or a smell of which it is so difficult to rid one's nostrils, as that produced by garlic and ancient sheepskins, and the other accompaniments of a Eoumanian peasant. Eadautz itself may be divided into its straggling, irregular town round the huge market square, with its one business street entirely in the hands of the Jews, and the Government buildings, including the hospitable commandant's pretty house and officers' quarters, and the fine stables and magnificent riding school attached. You may take it for granted at once that everything in connection with horses is well done in the most practical and systematic manner, and with its herds of horses turned out in summer to roam in the Carpathian mountains at their will for hundreds of miles, with its half-bred Arabian mares and stallions, with its Huzulen ponies, and with its close proximity to those glorious Carpathian forests, it is unmatched for situation and for the production of hardy, untiring horses. The lands which formerly belonged to the monastery of Sucowitza were taken by the Austrian Government in 1869, who now pay the monks a monthly668 THE NINETEENTH subsidy, and administer their revenues under the Minister of Agri culture, Count Falkenhayn. There are some 24,000 acres of culti vated land; but the farms are scattered, and there is no attempt at the same systematic management as is carried out at Mezohegyes, The stud, which has been in existence for over one hundred years^ consists of about 1,350 horses. The twenty-two stud stallions are perhaps as good a lot for the- purpose as it would be possible to get together. Among them four English thoroughbreds, the last purchase a son of Gralopin, two pure bred Arabs, both excellent of their kind, with good shoulders and good action, five half-bred Arabs, the feature of the stud, two of the Lippitzaner breed, and a remarkably handsome son of an Anglo- Norman mare, Egletante, by an English thoroughbred. 'What struck me about the so-called half-bred Arabs, which have been bred with the greatest care for a long period, was their extra ordinary good action and shoulders. Two especially are worthy of notice, one Gridran the 24th, a magnificent-looking bay with fine action and quality, nine inches below the knee, somewhat long in the back, but a model sire for carriage horses, and a four-year-old dark grey, Sheraky the 3rd. I find my notes of this horse are as follows:— ' I looked at this horse for a long time and could find no fault in him. Short, compact, with beautiful shoulders and quarters, his legs perfect both below and above the knee, with great muscle and bone, and full of quality, I believe he is the best horse in the- whole stable.' I must not weary the reader by taking him with me to all the groups of mares, and will simply say that they consisted of what are- called the big English mares, among which, though there are a few coarse mares, the Austrian's love of strength tending to make him perhaps too lenient of this quality, I counted eighteen that would have done honour to any show in England or Ireland as mares calcu lated to produce weight-carrying hunters. Small Arab and Lippitzaner mares, a very even lot of 15.1 high, half-bred English mares, Anglo- Arab mares, and the so-called big Arabian mares. I cannot dismiss these last without a few lines, as they impressed me more than anything I saw in Austria in the shape of horseflesh. To get to their station of Millichutz we drove through a picturesque bit of country, past homesteads of Eoumanian peasants, with their quaint gateways and stores of Indian corn piled under the projecting eaves of their whitewashed houses, with here and there a little 'gast- hof, in\ ariably in the hands of a Jew, as any money-making esta blishment in this country always is; through a Grerman colony, easily distinguishable from the rest of the country by the neat and sub stantial appearance of its houses and farm-buildings and prosperous—1892 AUSTRIAN ST 669 looking owners; and lastly througli a river, into which, when flooded and covered with ice in winter, these hardy horses plunge without the slightest ill effects, and where we saw those quaint boats hewn out of a single tree which in this district is still the only idea of boat-build ing held by a Eoumanian peasant. Once through the river we shortly reached the stud buildings, and on a marshy flat found sixty- two Arab mares, five being pure bred and more than half grey in colour. These were a lovely lot of mares about 15.3 high, with beautiful clean legs, plenty of bone, and marvellously good shapes and action, and that peculiar docility and intelligence which perhaps makes the Arab the most lovable of all horses. The young mares showed a striking likeness to some of the sires. I walked about among them for some time, handling them in any way I liked, and they crowded round me in such a manner, and were so inquisitive, that it was with the greatest difficulty that I could write my notes, and it was with a sigh of genuine regret that I tore myself away from them, with the feeling that I had never seen so many good animals together. The young horses here, as at Mezohegyes, are in winter all kept in large loose houses with straw yards attached, fed with oats from the time they are six weeks old, and groomed and handled in the same careful way, the first two years of a horse's life being rightly looked upon in Austria as the two most important. The young horses were very good, and it was not hard to distinguish those bred from the Arab mares and the stock got by Gridran the 24th and the Anglo- Norman horse Przedwit, both very impressive sires. The Lippitzaner horses of Spanish origin are also valued at Eadautz, where they have two Lippitzaner stallions and about thirty mares. As far as I could judge the Lippitzaners of the bad type were inclined to be long in the back and not too well shaped, but with the Lippitzaners of the good type there was but little to choose between them and the small half-bred Arab mares, except that the Lippitzaners are inclined to have Roman noses and to be a little coarse about the jaw, and possibly a trifle heavy in the point of the shoulder. I cannot, however, close this without noticing the haras of forty Huzulen mares that are kept constantly in the mountains winter and summer, and the seven or eight Huzulen stallions that are stationed in the mountain districts near Kadautz for free use by the people. These are a hardy, thickset race of ponies from thirteen to fourteen hands high, chiefly bays and browns, wonderfully sure-footed, excel lent shooting ponies, carrying fifteen or sixteen stone on their backs with ease over the roughest ground, and drawing huge loads of trees and timber, which seem altogether out of proportion to their size, down from the mountains and through the dry beds of the moun tain torrents. V ol . XXXI—N o . 182 Z ZTHE NINETEENTH April If anyone has driven through the country surrounding Eadautz, and met the countless light waggons laden with farm produce or timber, or been in Eadautz on a market day, and pushed his way through these gentle little beasts munching gourds while their masters are sitting on the ground eating their midday meal of greasy mess, or devouring what looked to be plates of dried sticklebacks, he will realise of what vast importance it is to the people to have a good breed of these ponies maintained. The ordinary number of horses in the Eadautz stud of 1,350 is somewhat less at present, as last year sixty-four mares and four stallions were sent from Eadautz to form the new Government stud at Biber, in Styria. Undoubtedly the chief features of Eadautz are its collection of mares and stallions crossed and recrossed with either pure or half-bred Arab blood for the last hundred years, and its facility for producing untiring sure-footed animals, the result of their ranging in summer at freedom over the wild plateaux of the Carpathians, plateaux which sometimes extend to twenty miles in length, and where, travel ling in charge of their mounted chicos from one feeding ground to another, they often cover from 400 to 500 miles in their summer 's run. The nearest mountain station is some ninety miles from Eadautz,. The horses travel in herds of about 400 each, six chicos being in charge of each hundred horses; and when the grazing grounds are reached, half of the chicos remain on duty for twenty-four consecu tive hours, to have their places taken in turn by the other half, who ride up from their little wooden sleeping huts, which may be several hours away. The horses require no driving, but in each case follow their own leaders, who in their turn follow the leading chico. Each night three huge fires are lit, and I am told that the horses always like to come near the fires for the sake of the warmth, as the nights in this part of the Carpathians are generally cool. In the entire country about 2,000 Eadautz stallions are now stationed, for which the service fee ranges from one to five florins; but rarely are the people asked to pay more than one or two florins, and there is a further provision to let out stallions on the following terms. The commandant assesses the price of a stallion at, say, from 1,500 to 3,000 florins; anyone can then take the horse on paying ten per cent, on this capital value, if he only keeps the stallion for the covering season, or six per cent, if he keeps it for the entire year, on the condition of its serving a certain number of mares. This custom is chiefly prevalent in Galicia, a great horse-breeding country, in some districts not unlike parts of Ireland, where now 450 Eadautz stallions are stationed, and where often a landowner may be compelled by a1892 AUSTRIAN ST FARMS 671 covenant in his father's will to maintain a stud of 100 or more breed ing mares. The mares at Kadautz are not solely selected for their shape and pedigree, but the characteristics of each family are care fully watched, and every year six picked mares are sent to the riding- school at Vienna and elaborately trained, and those that develop specially good qualities are kept for the stud, and the others disposed of. This careful selection, and the gentle handling that the horses receive, are very manifest, and the military control appears to have an excellent effect in the exactitude with which everything is done, and the manner in which orders are obeyed. That this would be impossible with civilians was found when for some time the stud at Eadautz was under civilian control, with anything but good results. The horses that are not good enough for stud purposes, or are not required by the State, are disposed of annually by an auction held at Eadautz at the end of September, but to buy a horse that is valued in the stud seems to be an impossibility. That the Austrian Government is doing much to improve the horses in the country is self-evident, and, although it is said to be at the cost of some 100,000^. a year, no one can say, having regard to the many indirect advantages which thereby accrue to the State, that this money is otherwise than profitably expended. The administra tion, which is admirably carried out under the personal supervision of Count Graevenitz, is under the general control of the Minister of Agriculture, and the supply of well-bred untiring horses, suitable for hacks and harness horses, and in many cases for chargers, is simply unlimited. I had not the opportunity of seeing the Austrian cavalry, but from the raw material I saw, in contrast to the three-cornered animals one too often sees purchased at Irish fairs for troopers, it is conceivable that the Austrian stamp of cavalry horse is very different from the English troop horse. No doubt, too, from the communes, and also from private owners, it is possible to buy good horses, and the German colonies, of which there are some eleven or twelve in Bukovina, are said to have a specially good race of mares, which, when crossed with the half-bred Arab stallions, produce very good results. It may seem strange to any Englishman that the highest authorities should so continuously breed from half-breds, but it must be borne in mind that all the stallions in the stud so called half-bred are descended from families whose breeding has been carefully watched for perhaps almost a century. Whether the Austrians would be wiser to devote more attention to developing that half-bred Arab race which struck me as so good, and whether, by their desire for powerful horses, they are a little led away to overlook coarseness at the expense of quality, is open to question. That they thoroughly understand the manage- z z 2m THE NINETEENTH April ment of the liorse from its infancy, on principles that are unfortu nately almost unknown in this country; that they are making vast strides in the improvement of the horses all over the country to its manifest advantage, and that they are the most generous and kindliest of people in imparting to an Englishman all he may want to know, anyone who has passed through the pleasant experiences which I have here essayed to relate will only be too ready to affirm. Frederick Wrench.1892 LET LONDON I venture to make a rejoinder to Mr. Protliero 's criticism of my defence of the London County Council, entitled ' Towards a Com mune,' wMch appeared in last month's issue of this Review. In an article entitled ' Towards Common Sense ' Mr. Prothero attacked my principles, questioned my taste, impugned my credit, and generally questioned the accuracy and logic of my statements. In so acting my critic fell into the common error that all journalistic opponents of the Council have made, who hoped, but failed by mere strength of invective and denunciation, to hide their enmity of the Council by ignorant or deliberate misstatements of the Council's work and conduct. Mr. Prothero, pursuing this line, says in one part of his article that my temperate but vigorous defence and truthful statements of the Council's position ' had been exaggerated into rhetorical falsehood.' No facts were adduced to prove such a statement; no figures brought forward to controvert the dispassionate presentment I made. Instead, we have wild disagreement and captious criticism, showing a lack of knowledge of English municipal life even of the most elementary character. The excuse that the article was hurriedly written could be accepted on matters of opinion or taste, but the wild utterances of my critic on matters of fact must not be allowed to pass uncontra dicted. First let us deal with the of the Council and the statement that ' the members of the old Council who most inspired the confidence of the public have all retired. Though Lord Eosebery seeks re-election. Sir John Lubbock is gone; Sir Thomas Farrer, Mr. Cohen, Lord Lingen, and Mr. Farquhar are also gone. In their place stand men unacquainted with business or finance.' In every in stance this statement is fiction or fabrication. Lord Rosebery has been re-elected by a popular constituency, and since then elected by the Council as its chairman. Sir John Lubbock, at the practically unanimous request of his old colleagues, has accepted the position of alderman. Sir Thomas Farrer, Lord Lingen, Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Farquhar have not retired. They are still, as aldermen elected for six years, or as elected councillors, members of the present Council. Three of the six councillors mentioned have been elected on to the674 THE NINETEENTH April Finance Committee, where they will continue to give the service they have previously rendered and which every member appreciates at its right value. It is absolutely untrue that their positions have been vacated, and it is equally a misstatement to say that their new colleagues ' are men elected not for their intelligence but for their political partisanship.' The new men appear to be quite equal to the old in ability and municipal influence; and the dire results of Mr. Prothero's pessimistic prediction will not be realised, as there is every reason to believe that the new members will devote as much time and administrative capacity to their new and arduous duties as did the old. The next objection to my article is its title. Here again my critic appears to have been influenced by the wild tribe of shrieking journalists, who have surrounded a good name socially expressive, municipally comprehensive, and historically correct, with all the wild phantasms of plunder, brigandage, and bacchanalian debauchery that twenty-one years ago they unjustly associated with the Commune of Paris. The collective, social, imaginative, and artistic instincts of the Paris workmen evolved order and system out of the cowardly and maladministrative anarchy in which the Imperialists had involved Paris before and during the siege. With enemies at the gates, and traitors within them, they attempted and, to a great extent, succeeded in establishing at the barricade, in their protest against Imperial centralised bureaucracy, that revolution in decentralised government and civic control of which by the ballot-box in London an instalment has been secured by the vote of London's craftsmen. A commune means to me, as it meant to the workers of Paris, a free city in a free country—a community possessing all the powers of a free people for its civic, social, physical, and artistic development, uncontrolled by any power other than that to which it voluntarily consents. As De Tocqueville says, ' It is in the commune that the force of a free people resides.' It means London governed and ad ministered by the openly elected of its choice, unhampered by the merely proprietary and predatory instincts of ground landlords, who, having plundered the rurals of their common lands, now with a malign unanimity conspire with an uncultured, inartistic, traditionless bourgeoisie of rentiers and monopoly capitalists to escape their municipal obligations. These people, with their inanimate wealth, wwh to outvote and outweigh the clamant needs of the millions of sentient human beings whose interests must be guarded, and whose future social, artistic, and industrial life can be, and must be, improved by a democratic municipality. Mr. Prothero, with the object, I presume, of frightening the ratepayers, jumps at fictitious conclusions, and skips fro m the com mune of his imagination to the more imaginary cost of maintaining1892 LET LONDON 675 it. Without admitting and pointing out the dissimilarity of Paris to London on physical, military, political, and other grounds, he immediately assumes that because the debt of Paris is 32^. 5s. Sd. •and its annual expenditure 61. 4s. per head respectively of the population, that London with 9£. 3s. per head of debt (none re munerative) and its 21. 7s. 9cZ. of annual expenditure (with no assets), must quadruple the first and double the second, in imitation of Paris, simply because the Council asks for wider powers and increased re sponsibilities and larger revenues. What are the facts ? The London County Council asks for powers to reduce both its debt and the burdens of the people by equalising the incidence of taxation, increasing its revenues and reducing its rates by taxing the ground landlords and municipalising monopolies, a policy which has achieved signal success in the opposite direction from risk, burden, and bankruptcy for the ratepayers in every town that has adopted it. Mr. Prothero, with contemptuous scorn, then asks if ' the London County Council is to expend upwards of 100,000,000^. in the purchase of the different businesses, to employ 35,000 electors, and to spend every year 3,000,000L in wages. Without experience or aptitude for business, it is to embark in a colossal business speculation in which every risk is to be borne by the ratepayers.' As to the ex perience and aptitude of councillors, the electors, the best and only judges, have decided in our favour, as against Mr. Prothero. It is necessary, however, now that the question of risk has been raised by Mr. Prothero and other Moderates, to deal with it, and to prove that all their vaticinations are groundless. London has no alternative between taking this much-exaggerated risk and very imaginary burden of bankruptcy, and being exploited, .as it is now, by the middleman. London must and will increase its debt, not by the arbitrary and inflated sum of 100,000,000Z., but to that amount necessary to give her the power of being released from ^ greater debt in the future, which must be incurred if this course is mot pursued. This debt contracted will be disproportionately diminished by utilising the revenues from her monopolies, which are now in private hands, to pay off the capital. The people of London had to choose, and they wisely decided on the 5th of March to release themselves and their successors from the load of an ever-increasing financial burden, by affirming the principle of capitalising the annual revenues from its monopolies, and the inte rest now paid thereon being used as a Sinking Fund to abolish the debt in thirty to forty years. If this is done, London's obligations to private ownership will speedily diminish, and at the end of a few years she will possess as assets for the debt incurred a greater and more valuable .property than that now held by private companies, and676 THE NINETEENTH April secure better services in the interval. This is not a figure of speech— it is the experience of every community whose councillors and advisers have been blessed with a beneficent courage. Let us deal further with this important subject. Hurling masses of figures at the heads of the uninitiated only confuses: general statements do not convince. The mere quotation of the expenditure of London per head for rate-charged administrative purposes and its relatively small debt must be viewed side by side with the debt and expenditure, plus what Mr. Prothero omitted—the assets that provincial towns absolutely own in their better and cheaper gas, tram, water, and other in dustrial and municipal works. London has hitherto stupidly con tracted a debt of 41,000,000^. in useful but unremunerative works only, and has left to private enterprise the carrying out of under takings that on 80,000,000^. of capital yield a net profit of 4,000,000^. to shareholders. This profit is wanted not to make London bankrupt, but to help reduce its rates, or, what is equal to it, cheapen and improve its services. London, with its unremunerative debt of 9^. 3s. 8c?. and no assets, is worse off now and prospectively than Liverpool with its debt of 12/. 6s. 4(i. and assets of 26/. 5s. or Glasgow with 9/. 9s. debt and assets 13/. 9s. How much better off other cities are than London is proved by the following comparative statement that in itself is an eloquent refutation of all that Mr. Prothero has advanced against a Progressive policy.

Beyond this, does not Mr. Prothero see that two-thirds of the net profit of 4,000,000/. earned by London's monopolies could be used by its municipal body as a sinking fund, whilst the remaining and rapidly increasing third could be utilised for profitable extension and development, which in its turn could earn the money necessary to still more rapidly and automatically reduce the remaining debt? What private impersonal enterprise and capital can do, municipal enterprise in many departments can more easily accomplish.1892 LET LONDON 677 That it can be done is easy of proof, and tlie only way to prove tlie safety, economy, efficiency, and permanent benefit of the policy of municipalisation of monopolies is to take one from ont of the 180 provincial towns that have adopted this policy, and see how the predictions of the Protheros have been falsified. Let us take Glasgow as an average example of the reckless progressive and socialist policy of making the ratepayer bankrupt, and what do we find ? Glasgow, in order to get its water, gas, markets, and tramways, in the last thirty-five years has contracted a debt of 3,151,544^. By means of that debt it now possesses assets of the value of 4,028,851^. 9s. 5d. ; it expends yearly a sum of 618,000?., and receives a revenue of 700,000?. Under the private ownership of its water supply, Glasgow citizens had to pay a 14c?. rate for a restricted supply of diluted sewage. Since the transfer has been made to the Corporation by purchase, Loch Katrine has been drawn upon, and by a bold, generous, and profitable scheme the 14c?. rate has been reduced to 6 c?. per 1?. rental; and it is computed that the 6c?. rate is entirely neutralised by the saving effected over the old system and supply, by the clean soft water that saves its cost in soap, soda, and other ingredients not now required for domestic and industrial purposes. Four hundred gallons are supplied for 1c?.—7s. 6c?. per annum for a house at 15?. rental, as against double that price in London. Beyond this cheap, clean, constant supply from cloudland itself, Glasgow—that was to be ruined by this enterprise—is rapidly paying off its original debt from its net profit, after interest, depreciation, and extensions are provided for; and its assets on the water supply and works exceeds the rapidly diminishing debt by 600,000?. The assets are 2,637,691?. 10s. 2d.', the debt 2,047,585?. What a different tale does London tell from the municipal enter prise of Glasgow on this question ! London has to pay a tremendous price for its timidity in grappling with its proper work. London pays 1,700,000?. for water that costs the companies only 700,000?. This surplus of 1,000,000?., or two-thirds of the London County Council's rate-earned income, is the exaggerated rent of ability and interest that private companies are allowed to take from Londoners for a water supply that is rightly the corporate property of the people whom they supply. In the supply of gas by municipalities what do we find ? That per ton of coal carbonised, and cubic feet of gas produced therefrom, the municipalised gasworks all over Britain show a cheaper and better result than private works. The price of municipal gas is less that large amount spread over all the consumers which the shareholders only divide where companies provide. The works of municipalities are kept in better order and repair, the approaches are tidier and cleaner.678 THE NINETEENTH April Their employes are better treated than where private ownership prevails. Glasgow takes from its gasworks a yearly revenue of 483,000Z. Its expenditure is 430,000Z.; its diminishing debt is 58O,O0OZ.; its increasing asset is 780,000Z.; and all this notwithstanding it now pays 50 to 75 per cent, more for its coal. Its output is 170 per cent, greater than when under private control. Its leakage is 50 per cent, less, the illuminating power the same, and its price reduced from 4s. Id. to 2s. 4c?., although wages have gone up and the three- shift system has been introduced. London, in contrast to this prosperity, allows its lighting to yield over 1,000,000Z. profit to private firms. On its tramways Glasgow has even a better record than on its water and gas. The Corporation has built thirty-two miles which it has previously leased to a company, but which will not be renewed again in 1894; 3 per cent, has been paid to the Corporation for redemption of the original debt contracted for building the lines ; 4 per cent, has been paid by the company for renewals ; 150Z. per annum per mile has been paid by the company as rent. In twenty- one years 490,000?. has been paid by the company, 150,000Z. more than the total cost, exclusive of an average of 8 per cent, dividend taken by the company in that period. This latter fruitful source of revenue will henceforth be appro priated by Glasgow, and good results will follow in better conditions for employes, cheaper fares, and better communication, and, what is equally important, single ownership of the roads and trams. Upon the question of municipal lodging-houses Mr. Prothero is equally unfortunate. It is true that the Council wisely decided to build a better building than it originally intended—even common lodging-houses should be well built and artistic—and if in so doing it has not catered for the very lowest, who cannot afford to pay the additional penny for a better class of accommodation, this can soon be got over by providing another less costly building, which some day must be followed by free nightly shelters for the absolutely destitute, not as a matter of pauperising charity, but as a social necessity. In Glasgow the seven lodging-houses for men and women produce a yearly rent profit of 4,164Z. 9s. 4cZ., or 4| per cent, on cost and maintenance. There, in water, gas, tramways, and housing, in its markets, and also in the Corporation widening, deepening, and im proving the docks and adapting the river Clyde to its trade, the Pro gressive municipal policy has falsified all the pessimistic predictions urged against it. The motto of this enterprising city is ' Let Glasgow flourish!' This it has done, and its present municipal prosperity has only been realised as it has taken the up-grade to Municipal Socialism. The London Progressives, with sensible foresight and municipal1892 LET LONDON 679 inspiration, believe that wliat Glasgow and Birmingham have achieved London can surely attempt and will speedily accomplish. Let London live! must henceforth be London's motto; and live it only can when its monopolies have been absorbed by its municipality and ' its middlemen have ceased from troubling and the jobber is at rest.' Mr. Prothero, after inconsistently advocating the acquisition of the London water supply, says there is ' no pressure of immediate necessity' for acquiring the other monopolies. That is merely an opinion, and as such, against the decisive vote in favour of acquisition, is valueless. The most elementary knowledge, and above all experience, of the bad results of dual control and ownership in a large city makes it an equally strong and more profitable plea for the Council owning the gasworks, tramways (already settled), the docks, and markets, and, after those, others. The probability of electric light taking the place of gas has not depreciated gas shares ; on the contrary, the. rivalry has improved both, and even if the Council after twenty years ownership was left with the property on its hands, its original debt capital would have been repaid, and the ground, works, and other property of the Gas Committee could be adapted as electric-light works or municipal coal depots; and if not for this, the rapidly in creasing value of the land alone would be an equivalent asset repay ing all trouble and expenditure. The charge glibly made that the Progressives ' desire to starve intellectual labour in order to enrich the labour of bone and muscle ' is another ridiculous cry invariably put forward by people who have an exaggerated notion of their own genius and ability. In every case where vacancies have occurred a fixed and handsome sum has been offered, which officers have accepted with avidity. As education becomes more general and public spirit increases, the dif ference between the remuneration of brain and brawn will decrease, the absurdly high salaries, in the majority of cases decided by fictitious standards, and too often for meretricious qualifications, will disappear. The Council's salaries are now large enough to attract the best men to our offices, and in several cases a larger salary offered than the one previously given has only attracted the same men. The mere effluxion of time, and occasionally the happy accident of not retiring or dying at the proper time, are not sufficient for making a glorified clerk into a Carnot of municipal organisation whose rent of ability would simply have astounded a Watt, a Stephenson, a Paxton, or a Faraday—and starving the subordinates, who after all do their share of their work. If ever the people are face to face with losing the services of some eminent genius, the em bodiment of all the talents, and suffering an irreparable loss, they680 THE NINETEENTH April will pursue the common-sense view hitherto pursued, and get more by retaining and paying him than they will by losing such services. There is a payment given by the Council now that the old Board did not give to their officials. Public life is now popular. It has been dignified, and its paid officers now take their proper places, and are in every respect co-equal with the Councillors and their employers— surely an important consideration. We have not yet reached the happy condition of the citizen of Chseronea, Plutarch—or Epaminondas, who in his day was a main- drainage commissioner—who in discharging their duties honoured their offices and ennobled themselves, and put their remuneration in the background as being but incidental to their good public work. But we are going that way with great rapidity. The only criticism in Mr. Prothero's article worth serious con sideration is the just complaint of my inaccuracy in saying the Blackwall Tunnel cost in round figures 1,000,000/. instead of the contract price, 871,OOOL The reason I did this was that my ex perience of large undertakings, always confirmed by actual facts, is that 10 to 12 per cent, for diversions, additions, and ' extras' should be fairly added to such work to meet probable and unforeseen contingent im provements that generally follow the main completion of large public works. I am then complained of for not dealing with the control of the police. Exigencies of time and space prevented it. My experiences at Trafalgar Square, Dod Street, and other places prevents me from being an absolutely impartial advocate of the police being under the control of the Council. But other experiences, such as the unique example of the dock strike, in which the tact, temper, and civility of the City police, controlled by a Watch Committee of the Corporation of London, have proved its capacity and superiority over an imperially directed police force, the men of which are in a chronic condition of discontent, and against whose Commissioners, and especially their unnecessary military chief constables, they have practically no redress. The militarising of a purely civil force has demoralised the men, im paired its detective branch, dissatisfied the public; and as soon as it pays politically to alter it, either of the two great parties will do so, and will probably (I hope not) have an Imperial force of 2,000 men for Parliament and Grovernment buildings, leaving 13,000 to be under the Watch Committee of the County Council, say in the year 1899. Upon questions of main drainage, housing, and others I gave our predecessors their share of credit. Upon the question of future water supply my critic takes the wrong line. There is no choice between the present practically uncontrolled ownership by the companies and the Progressive alternative of complete municipal ownership. The fact is, London must go to Wales as Glasgow went to Loch Katrine, Liverpool to North Wales, and Manchester to Thirlmere, for water.1892 LET LONDON 681 The sooner this is embarked upon the better. In the meantime, local subsidiary sources must be found by the companies. That is their business and duty till a pure and permanently unlimited supply is secured, independent of present negotiations and the ultimate pur chase and price to be given. That price can be best determined and reduced to its proper proportions by London deciding, what its scientists and experts have already agreed upon, that outside the river Thames and its affluents its future service of water must come. On another point Mr. Prothero demands correction. What patience can be displayed towards one who, in face of over whelming evidence to the contrary, says, ' the proportion of wealth to poverty is less in London than most other cities in the world,' or that ' the number of the deserving and indigent poor is relatively small,' and other strident callous nonsense of this character. Some of us have read, not once, but many times, the inventory of London's poverty, indigence, and social wreckage that Charles Booth in his book, with loving care and labour, has compiled. Within its covers are pages of human documents, each of which bears the heavy thumb-marks that past social neglect, municipal niggardliness, and corporate irresponsibility have imposed. Until that book—Poverty's dread account and apologia—is proved incorrect; until its dispassionate record of misery is obliterated by the remedial influences of civic agencies—such statements as the above made by Mr. Prothero do not reflect much credit either to his head or heart. Upon questions of rating Mr. Prothero tries to make out there is not much difference between Moderate and Progressive. It is a pity this has not been known officially before. Time, and the in evitable growth of socialism as a political and municipal force, will perhaps soon decide, and give the public an opportunity of separating the sheep from the goats. It is, however, significant of the change that is coming that right in the heart of residential ground land lordism, the vestry of St. George's, Hanover Square, should play the part of the worm that turns, and join with other districts in their desire for equalising the burdens of taxation and taxing the ground landlord. That in its turn will be secured, and in its turn give way to cumulative rating, to which the wealthy are irrevocably doomed. Increased representation to mere money and unconscious wealth is a delusion of Mr. Prothero and Mr. Morley's ' dreamer of dreams.' Upon labour regulations enforced by the Council the Moderates have apparently been converted since the election by the opposition their programme, or lack of one, received. Certain it is their political allies will meet a similar fate, already in store for them, if they have nothing better than the ' Everlasting No' to offer.682 THE NINETEENTH April Mr. Prothero concludes Ms animadversions by urging the Council to confine itself within the four corners of the Act of 1888. Till that Act is amended and embodies within it all the powers enjoyed by other municipalities, there can be no peace between the Council and Governments that withhold its just and legal powers. Till these powers are conceded, the London programme of complete autonomous government and administration will occupy the fore most place in politics, even to the exclusion of many Imperial (ques tions those political veterans superfluous that strut the stage of Parliament and prolixity, and are periodically galvanised into life by Liberals and Tories with the express but concealed object of preventing the area of private exploitation being circumscribed by municipal effort in the interest of the common good. The Moderates have had their lesson : will they profit by it ? In Imperial legislation and promises of future work there are signs that the Grovernment have learned that negation supplies no bond, and that a policy of drift and distrust will destroy any political faction, however strong, in these epoch-making times. Let Mr. Prothero and his political partisans cease carping at the greatest political fact of this century—the nascent commune of London that, in proportion to the attacks made upon it by vested; interests, will play to Parliament the to I g that the Cordeliers and Jacobin clubs played to the States-General a century ago. Its in fluence will mo aid and dominate in a collectivist direction those political principles and institutions that to-day are arrayed against it. It must always be more popular with the people than Parliament. It ministers to their municipal and material needs. Its activity is seen in its parks, roads, and public places ; it enters over the thresh old of its citizens' doors ; they feel its pulse, the people provide its motive power 5 its victories and its gains are theirs, its defeats they poignantly resent. Londoners, with the daily living presence of its Council's loving care before them, stood up as one man and annihi lated at the last election the decaying remnant of pinchbeck politicians who would sell London bound hand and foot to be sacrificed to Bumble and the middleman, and over its remains would promote a company to exploit the profits of their city's funeral feast. It is very difficult for one who predicted, three weeks before the election, that ' the Moderates would get the soundest thrashing they have yet received,' to do aught but rejoice at the victory that London has secured over the enemies within her gates. To many causes that victory has been attributed. But the real cause consisted, not as Journal des Debats humorously suggested, in ' la question des dues'; neither was the success due to the staying at home of the Moderates, although it is partly true that the Moderates are getting too respect able even to vote reactionary. It was not due to the campaign of the Liberal leaders, who, in the victory just achieved, have been beaten only1892 LET LONDON 683 a degree less than their opponents, the Moderates. The other sec tions who have been badly beaten in this election are those hopelessly impracticable people who abuse the name of Socialist, and who advo cate the unattainable, simply because to secure the immediately possible requires work, ability, and self-sacrifice, which they cannot display. Prisoners to a phrase, confined by their narrow prejudices and conceit within the limited space their own small courage has drawn around them, they have paid a heavy price for their dog-in- the-manger policy. Contrary to tradition and the principles of re presentation, strangers were foisted on constituencies in the most undemocratic fashion. This dictatorial conduct has met with its just reward, and, fortunately, popular views have not sustained that defeat, through the folly of irresponsible cliques, that might have been anticipated. The Sabbatarians have also sustained a crushing defeat in their miserable attempt to make London as dismal as themselves. Fussy interference with theatres and music halls, apart from necessary structural supervision, did not receive any substantial support, although the Councillors who embodied this were returned again. But this was for other and better work. The theatrical candidates were hopelessly defeated, as narrow representatives of a class interest deserved to be. The men who won the victory were those who, in the past, had been indifferent to municipal politics, and who in this instance were enthused into action by the real evidence and proof of the past Council's work. The artisan voted out of pure gratitude for the liberal policy displayed towards an improvement of his daily life by the Council's action on parks, workmen's trains, housing, and other cognate matters. The labourers, who have hitherto been the reserve army of voters, came forward because they appreciated the minimum wage and fair hours of labour, and, with the artisan, approved of the Council beginning the end of the sweater's career. The intellectual villa-resident, whose children enjoys the free lawn-tennis, croquet, cricket, and football grounds, also proved by voting his appreciation on the 5th of March. The small shopkeeper, who until then was the passive slave of the landlord, revolted against a continuance of his dependent posi tion. But the labour vote, pure and simple, was the prime factor of the success. In South London, where it was roused, enthused, and organised, not a single seat was lost. Three-fifths of the increased vote over 1889 was secured there; three-fifths of the gains in seats was there realised ; and there the majorities were enormously greater than elsewhere. On the north of the river, where Progressives met Moderates without the organised assistance of the labour vote, they684 THE NINETEENTH April stood as they were in 1889, or botli parties only slightly increased their votes. But where the labour vote was cast, the majorities were greatly increased. This is no accident or coincident. On the contrary, it is a political portent that will cause the Government and the Opposition front benches to realise what has not yet dawned upon them—that if they want the support of the people, no partial programme will secure it. Now that the Progressives have an overwhelming majority the question is being asked, ' What will they do ?' Their first act, in electing three Moderates as aldermen, speaks well for their magna nimity. The election of three labour aldermen shows also a lively appreciation of the help that labour gave in the election, and confirms my view of the part labour successfully played in it. Generally the Council must, as a matter of legal necessity, carry out the purely executive and administrative work imposed upon it by law. Outside that work the Council cannot do better than continue its policy of taking effective steps to actually secuie those alterationb in the Act of 1888 that prevent its committees from doing their work promptly, through absurd financial restiictions that the Treasury does not endorse, and which the Local Government Board ought to at once remove. Beyond this mere mechanical alteration the Council cannot do better than persist in securing the wider powers from Parliament that for three years it has been demanding. The Council is now re-arranging the work of its committees, defining the duties of its chairman, and ought in the interests of all concerned to clearly define the functions of its clerk, which are now vague and unsatisfactory. The suggestion thrown out in some quarters, to create a 'cabinet' or ' executive,' I hope will be stoutly resisted by all who desire to continue the public, popular, open policy of letting committees who really know most about the work decide the lines on which that work shall be conducted 5 always acting, of course, within its proportionate spending limits and the approving vote or veto of the Council. The best method of getting consistency and continuity of municipal policy is to allow the ' common sense of mostof its Councillors in open Council to decide. In a multitude of councillors there is not always wisdom, but there is more likeli hood of safety, impartiality, and honest work by this means than might be possible if an 'executive' was appointed or a 'cabinet' tried to either initiate or veto measures the Council, as a whole, did notjapprove. There is no analogy between Parliament and the Council. Parlia ment deals mainly with abstract legislative propositions, and where it does discharge executive and administrative functions by its cabinet ministers or heads of departments, its work could be improved upon, and money saved, if there was some more direct1892 LET LONDON 685 representative supervision than now prevails, and which the Council now possesses in its committees. A cabinet or executive does, and will, weaken the responsibility of individual councillors and committees. In Parliament this is shown by the disgraceful indifference of members to the Army, Navy, and Indian Estimates, involving scores of millions of money, that are rushed through an empty House. If a cabinet is established, then the personal attention and responsibility that has characterised this Council will disappear; and when that happens the beginning of bad municipal government begins. Municipal government in England is as pure and as good as it is simply because the primitive communal system of open individual and collective responsibility has been maintained. Every instance of municipal decadence has only taken place when this healthy system has been departed from. As sure as large empires mean small men, so does centralised, secret, and internal control produce elements of political intrigue, weaken the moral and civic responsibility of representatives, and open up the possibility of machine politics—always the precursor of nepotism and neglect. The Council has really done so well in the past—its last decision to exclude all members from committees that came in contact with trades or callings in which they are interested, its refusal to allow any two councillors from the same district, or relatives, to serve on the same committee, are but several of many alterations it has already effected in the right direction. hat it has to do in the future is to deserve the full and generous confidence of its constituents. This it will achieve not by plausible but prospectively dangerous schemes of centralising internal con stitution, but by treading the broad open path of democratic publicity and vigilant undivided, uncontrolled responsibility. This it will do; and if, in the three years that are before it, the Council completes its present negotiations for the purchase of the tramways and water services, develops its housing scheme, presses forward its necessary works of main drainage and other large under takings, it will do all that can be expected. If it acts with the same public spirit, and maintains its present reputation for incorruptibility unsullied, I^ondon will at the end of its term of office show its un divided support and approval by a renewal of its confidence and its votes. John Burns. Vol. XXXI—No. 182 3 A686 THE NINETEENTH April NOTICEABLE 1. THE PLATFOEM, ITS KISE AND PEOGrEESS. 1 The title of this book may attract by its novelty. Or it may for a moment repel those to whom at first sight it possibly forms a puzzle. The Platform, taken literally, includes but a small portion of a public meeting, and many public meetings have no platforms at all. From it, however, flows forth ' the word,' to prompt and guide the minds of men; that word, which, as far back as the days of Homer, was alone admitted to the honour of alliance with the sword, as the symbol and the instrument of glory for man. 2 Mr. Jephson could not perhaps have found a better designation for his novel and hardy undertaking, which is nothing less than to exhibit a political history of his country in constant and close association with the gradual development of a power that had had a main share in framing it. Apart from violent or palpable changes, visible on the surface of affairs, the body politic is also subject to the continual action of a silent process, which insensibly alters the distribution of forces within the structure. Art, literature, science, industry, commerce, and re ligion, in their several evolutions, are continually competing for com mand over the thought of man and the formation of his mental habits. The straggle is carried on in shifting forms, with varying powers, and with results chequered in their detail but collectively tending to assume a decisive character. After a longer or shorter time, the changes become so charged with practical influence and power, that they cannot be overlooked, and the first perception of them has the effect of a surprise ; as when, at a certain juncture in the early Christian history, ' the world awoke, and found itself Arian.' It is thus that the power of the Platform has grown from a small trickling brook into a mighty river. And the parallel is further observable in this important particular. The little stream, tumbling The Platform, its Rise and Progress. By Henry Jephson. 2 vols. 8vo. (London: Macmillans &amp; Co.) 1892. 2 The grand epithet wSidvupa, man-glorifying, is applied by Homer exclusively to the place of Assembly, and the Battle.1892 NOTICEABLE 687 down the rocks of tlie mountain side, is noisy and obstreperous ; but when it has grown to be a river, traversing the plains below, it moves calmly as in the consciousness of strength. So it is with the Platform. Its earliest manifestations were not always such as it can own with credit. The disgraceful Gordon riots in 1780 may be said to have taken their origin from a public meeting held on May 29, with Lord George himself in the chair; and the pulpit, 3 which is essentially of the Platform's kin, had in the preceding year blown its trumpet, and had given rise to very serious disturbances in Glasgow and Edinburgh, intended by their authors to procure the repeal of the first Eoman Catholic Relief Act, passed in 1778. Even, however, at that early period, the Platform had made good its title to be deemed an instrument of good. In 1745, the county of York met to support the Government. The choice between Hanoverianism, as it then stood, and the House of Stuart, was a somewhat sorry one; still, this was an effort on behalf, if not of the greater good, yet of the lesser evil. The Platform also played a creditable part in that resistance to aggressions on British freedom which is rather incongruously associated with the name of Wilkes, and in the promotion of the few reforms, which preceded the adminis tration of Mr. Pitt. In principle, it was fully recognised by the Constitution under two well-known forms : those of the county meeting convened by the sheriff, and of the hustings at elections, first made classical and famous by Mr. Burke at Bristol. As public order was gradually consolidated, voluntary association and assemblage grew up by a thoroughly natural process around these older forms; for it is in the light of a security for order that the intervention of the sheriff in the matter of county meetings should be regarded. As, however, the power and the practice grew, so did the jealousy of privileged classes and of statesmen in power. The Platform was silenced during the second and descending period of the statesmanship of Mr. Pitt. With far less excuse, our legislation assumed under Lord Sidmouth a character almost ferocious; and the slaughter of eleven persons at a meeting in Manchester in 1819 denotes the high-water mark of insolent repression. And not until the Eeform Bill of 1832 do we reach the epoch, from which dates the rapid and continuous growth of the Platform in its use and in its power. As three F's were the watchword of the Irish tenant with refer ence to Irish land, and three R's are supposed to supply the basis of an education for the people, so, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, three P's have denoted the instruments, by which British freedom has been principally developed and confirmed. These three P's are Petition, Press, and Platform. Immediately after the Reform Act, the first of these was chiefly in vogue; and the Act for the 3 Jephson, i. 121. * 3 A 2THE NINETEENTH April emancipation of the slaves was carried under the influence of a national sentiment, which owed its manifestation to this medium. As time has flowed on, the scale of its use has been contracted; mainly y perhaps, because it is a method involving a large aggregate of trouble for those who resort to it. A considerable time elapsed with nothing more than gradual growth in the action of the Press ; but after the- repeal of the Stamp Duty, and especially after the repeal of the Paper Duty, the sphere of this action became enormous, and the newspaper proved itself to be a mighty agent, both in the sphere of politics and in the mental training of the people. The Platform exercised a great power throughout the period: chiefly, however, during the greater part of it, on the recurrence of a general election, or locally on the occasions when a member of Parliament rendered his account to his constituents. Sir Eobert Peel and his party greatly helped it forward; for the Platform includes the banquet, and his speech at Glasgow, in January 1836, where some 3,400 persons met him at dinner, offered one of the most remarkable examples ever known of its use. It has, however, been during the last quarter of a century that it has most conspicuously developed the power of public meetings. On the question of the Irish Church in 1868, on the policy of the Beaconsfleld Grovernment in 1876-80,. on the extension of the Franchise in 1884, last and most of all on the Irish question of 1886-92, which has united the intensity of a crisis with the duration of a Parliament, the Platform has asserted itself with an ever-increasing intensity of action. In 1868 and 1884, the cause favoured by the Platform was also that of the Press. In 1876-80 the metropolitan Press was against it; but it had the support of the chief provincial newspapers. Most of all have the circumstances of 1886-92 been remarkable. For here, while the Platform has worked predominantly on one side, the large majority of journals having the widest circulation have taken the other: while petitions may be put wholly out of the account. If, then, this had been a contest between the prevailing forces of the Press on the one side, and the Platform on the other, there seems to be some colour given to the opinion that the Platform at its maximum of power is stronger than the Press. For, during some five years, over a hundred Parliamentary elections have been giving no inconsiderable indication of the sense of the people, and in these elections a balance of no less than twenty seats have been carried over from the side supported by the Press to that espoused by the Platform. But let not the Press tremble for its prerogatives. The Platform indeed both displays and generates living energy. It quickens sympathy, besides increasing information, and it brings to bear the whole power of fellowship in a cause. Yet it is in the main an occa sional and intermittent power, while the action of the Press is con tinuous and permanent as that of old Time himself. Indeed, it is1892 NOTICEABLE 689 not to be desired tliat the country should regularly be subjected to the sort of national fever, which has come upon us about once a month in connection with the bye-elections since an early date in 1887. Nay, the demands made upon the speaking powers of members of Parliament for speeches here, there and everywhere, have increased to such a point that, if continued at the present rate, they (threaten the enormous mischief of extinguishing their opportunities of study and reflection. One supreme effort is still in prospect; but nature is sure to cry out for remission and relief. We may reasonably hope that Press, Petition, and Platform will hereafter be, as they have been heretofore, combined as harmoniously as the figures of the three Graces, and will contribute, each in its due measure according to the calls of the time, towards the consolidation and progress of free government.

To begin with, it is the only autobiography I ever read of which it can be said that it errs on the side of brevity, if it errs at all. Its title exactly describes it. The Recollections are the recollections of a happy life by a woman supremely endowed with the faculty of enjoyment; sur* rounded from her infancy by an atmosphere of ennobling influences ; of generous sentiment; of reverence for all that is good and righteous; of enthusiasm for all that is pure and beautiful in nature or art. In her youth Miss North must have been a lady of striking and imperial beauty. The pose of that noble head, and the lustre of those full-orbed eyes, suggested rather than adequately portrayed in the little vignette which serves as a frontispiece to the first volume, were still traceable in the glorious face I gazed at for the first time some twelve or thirteen years ago. Then the years of incessant work, and the hardships, and consequent breakdown in her health, had told upon her ; but even then in person she appeared to me the most majestic woman I had ever known. I learnt to regard her as, in intellect and character, the most gifted and high-souled human being I could ever hope to know. 1 The Recollections of a Happy Life: Autobiography North. Edited by her sister, Mrs. John Addington Symonds. In 2 vols, London : Macmillan &amp; Co. 1892.690 THE NINETEENTH April Once I asked her playfully—I am afraid I ouglit to say imper tinently—where she got her commanding stature from, for the Norths were short. ' From the Montagus, of course !' she answered. ' Doirt you know? ' Yes ! The blood of the Montagus and the Norths was in her veins, and in herself she united the genius and the vigour of both those illustrious races. A lineal descendant of Eoger North,, whose autobiography she enabled me to print for the first time in 1887, her handwriting was so exactly like that of her ancestor that the one could with difficulty be distinguished from the other. Her extraordinary musical gifts and her enthusiasm for pictorial art came down to her in the same way by hereditary transmission. Roger North was the intimate friend, and eventually the executor, of Sir Peter Lely, and, as he would have expressed it, one of the great of his age, while his devotion to music was so conspicuous that his enemies called him ' Eoger the fiddler.' I know nothing more charming than the introductory chapter,, entitled ' Early Days and Home Life.' It is only too short, only thirty-eight pages—not a page for a year ; but it shows us the price less companionship which the girl and woman enjoyed—the incom parable joyousness of those years of preparation for her subsequent career, the wonderful circle of friends, the immense advantage of daily intercourse with men and women of culture and accomplishments of all kinds, the days that were all too brief for the talk and the questionings and the gladdening tasks that were crowded into them, the journey ings to and fro half over Europe, the unwearied tending of those gardens and glass-houses at Hastings. 'We lived in those houses all the spring, she says,' my father smoking and reading in the temperate regions, where we had a table and chairs, while I washed and doctored all. the sick plants and potted off the young seedlings 5' and always at her side the father whom she loved with an almost idolatrous affection, and whom others appear to have admired and revered with a loyalty only less absorbing than her own. Mr. North died in October 1869. ' He left me indeed alone,' she says : ' I wished to be so ; I couldn't bear to talk of him or anything else, and resolved to keep out of the way of all friends and relations till I had schooled myself into that cheerfulness which makes life pleasant to those around us.' Note that phrase. around us —it is, as it were, the theme which is constantly recurring in the noble symphony of that brave and unselfish life. In the summer of 1871 Miss North, then in her fortieth year, set forth on her travels. An invitation of a friend drew her to spend some months in the United States. Charles Kingsley's delightful' book At added fuel to the burning of my rage for seeing the Tropics.' From this time till 1884 Miss North spent her life in almost continual travel ; but she was the last person in the world who could be content with aimless sight-seeing. Gradually, and somewhat rapidly, she formed1892 NOTICEABLE 691 tlie purpose cf making a collection of the flora of every portion of the • globe, so far as it might be possible to do so, and to paint her illus trations of plant life in the habitat of the several and genera that deserved to be delineated. In the first six years of her wander ings she had travelled through the United States, the West Indies, the highlands of Brazil, California, Japan, Borneo, Ceylon, Teneriffe, and Madeira, and had brought from all these countries an immense collection of her paintings, which, on her return to England in 1877, were exhibited in the South Kensington Museum, some hundreds of them being framed at the public expense, though Miss North declined to part with any of them, whatever price might be offered. Next year she spent for the most part in India, bringing back another collection of pictures from Upper India, Benares, Calcutta, Rajputana, Baroda, and other famous places in the peninsula—this time feted everywhere, and yet always hard at work, as if her livelihood had depended upon her toil. Unless my memory deceives me, I heard', on her return to England, after her Indian journey in 1879, that she had actually produced nearly a picture a day for every day that she had been absent. Yet these Indian paintings are among the most remarkable and striking ones that she ever drew. The Indian collection was exhibited in Conduit Street, and during the which they occasioned a writer in the threw out the suggestion that all Miss North's works should be acquired by the nation, and be assembled in a gallery of their own at Kew. Miss North at once acted upon the hint, but, instead of selling her works, she resolved to give them to the nation, and to erect a gallery for them at her own expense. How munificently she carried out her resolve all visitors to Kew may judge for themselves; The elaborate catalogue is her work, and every decorative design in the building not only emanated from her, but was actually executed by her own hand. The plans for the building were generously furnished by her friend, the late Mr. Ferguson. Miss North's last journeyings were undertaken at the request of Mr. Darwin. They led her over the Australian continent, thence to Tasmania and New Zealand, nor was she satisfied till she had brought home fresh spoils from Southern Africa, the Seychelles, and Chili. She returned to England, never to leave it again, in 1885, spent another year in completing her Catalogue of the Kew Gallery, and in 1886 she retired from 4 the madding crowd' of London and took up her residence at Alderley, in Gloucestershire; there, in an almost incredibly short time, she contrived to make for herself a terrestrial paradise, where the birds of the air found their happy home, and a thousand rare plants became acclimatised, as if they all knew she loved them and were fain to rejoice in her guardianship. If any imagine that this book is only a book of botanical interest, or only a book of wearisome description, or only a book of mere692 THE NINETEENTH April travellers' tales, such, imaginative person has only to open it at any page wherever it may chance to present itself. The style is as near perfect as any style can be ; the tone is incomparably innocent, gay, and fascinating ; the human interest is everywhere paramount. From first to last we are living in the very best society that the world can produce. If in Miss North's presence everybody did not consciously put on their best manners and turn their best side to her, she certainly had a quite magical power of seeing what good there was in everything and everybody. How she manages to keep absolutely free from petty gossip and small talk quite perplexes one as one reads. But such men as Lord Lytton and Sir Eichard Temple, the Rajah of Sarawak and the beautiful Eani, native princes and Russian barons, and a hundred other queer human creatures, pay her court, each after his fashion. President Grant, at the White House, went out of his way to entertain her, under the impression that site was a daughter of the Prime Minister, whom it is not generally supposed that Americans delight to honour. Even Brigham Young interviewed her. ' Horrid old wretch !' she exclaims ; ' my hand felt dirty for a week after shaking hands with him.' As for the stories of beasts and birds and reptiles, they are legion, and a more bewitching book for boys and girls—a more stimulating book—I have not met with for many a long day. Of course, all the creatures that are upon the face of the earth trusted her and feared her not—that strange power which perfect fearlessness and perfect guilelessness bestow upon loving and sympathetic natures Miss North had to an extraordinary degree. Animals seemed to understand her, children loved her, the birds came near her without shrinking. In all her many travels she never met with any of those vulgar adventures which are usually to be traced to the stupidity, or the insolence, or the timidity of the travellers themselves ; and so, from first to last, Miss North's career was always a happy career, and reads us all the lesson that if we would find life worth living we must live for others as well as for our selves, winning their confidence and, it may be, their love by being pleasant to those around us. A ugustus J essopp.1S92 K0T1GEABLE 693 3. GfRANIA 1 Novels axe published on every side of you. You can as soon hope to escape from them as from the east wind in spring. But unless I know what you mean by ' a good novel/ or what you expect to find in it, I cannot do as you ask and recommend you a novel to read. Is it a philosophical essay, such as we receive from the Browning of prose, with its curiously inlaid style, and its mosaic of brilliant aphorisms, verbal subtleties, and suggestive reflections on human character ? Is it a dramatic embodiment of a pessimist's creed, inter preted by the George Eliot of the peasant world with the true power Of an artist, but revealed in a coarse, grimly realistic form, and steeped in heavy gloomy colouring ? Is it a highly spiced farrago of fiction, which lives and moves and has its being in the shambles of civilisation, and in which there is Much of crime, and more of sin, And horror the soul of the plot ? Is it some mystery of crime, a detective puzzle ingeniously con structed as a locksmith pieces together a delicate lock, a story which, when once the secret is revealed, is never read again, and falls as flat as a conundrum to which you know the answer ? Is it a fractious mixture of religion and fiction with its celestes et moeurs souterraines, which seeks to dramatise the results of Grerman theological thought in a form that admits neither of truth nor reverence, and endeavours to make the dose of theology more palatable by the flavour of the slums of Paris ? If any of these types fulfil your ideal of' a good novel,' do not read Grania. Miss Lawless does not redress the inequality of the sexes by proving that though women may not be heard in the congregation they may yet preach instructive sermons. Nor does she stimulate curiosity by proposing a riddle, and maintain the interest in her facts by suggesting a variety of false answers before she gives the true explanation. Nor does she seek her inspiration in the Old Bailey and the Divorce Court, or interpret any social creed, or allow her gift of storytelling to be overpowered by her critical faculty, or make thought everything and incident nothing. But if you still appreciate the simplicity, truth, purity, and freshness which constituted the quieter charm of domestic novels, or if you are not too weary of Irish politics to be interested in faithful, strong, unconventional pictures of the 1 Grania, the Stony of an Island. By the Hon. Emily Lawless. 2 vols. London Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1892.694 THE NINETEENTH April Irish, peasantry in remote and unknown districts, or if you value a local colouring that is at once minutely observed and both vividly and harmoniously reproduced, by all means read Island. A story by the skilful hand that wove the web of the tragedy of Hurrish's life in and among the conditions which distract the Ireland of to-day, or restored the Elizabethan past in the days of Essex by making her actors living beings, instead of leaving the dead figures lying in state amid accessories which are revived with true antiquarian exactitude, ought to be gratefully welcomed by every lover of fiction. Miss Lawless's Ireland is not the ideal Ireland of Lever, with its featherheaded gentry who witch the world with noble horsemanship, a country governed by an aristocracy of Charles O'Malleys, and served by a serf class of Micky Frees. It is far more like the true Ireland of Banim, the peasant-born novelist of the Irish peasantry. She is deeply impressed with the gloomy side of the Irish character, and fully conscious—perhaps too conscious—of the strain of wild melan choly which runs through the peasant's reckless extravagance and exuberant drollery like the rambling music of an .ZEolian harp caressed by the wind. The scene of Grania is laid among the melancholy dots of wind- worn, wind-tormented land, that are set in the midst of an in hospitable sea off the coast of Galway—scarred, defaced derelicts, abandoned to the mercy of waves and storms. Land scarcely exists in the ordinary sense of the word: the islands are masses of perpen dicular, ladder-like rocks of impressive vastness, sculptured into strange prehistoric shapes by the sea and air and rain, interspersed with wastes of sand, sprinkled with sickly bent or patched with white campion, and only relieved at the rarest intervals by green platforms, backed by ciTquesof rock clothed with mountain-ash, holly, and fuchsia. In the gullies and fissures of these rocky islands are scattered the turf-scented, chocolate-tinted cabins, brine-encrusted, sea-battered homes, dear to their owners as the one spot on earth that is theirs. The sea, the wind, the earth are the main factors in the lives of those who, like the inhabitants of Inishmaan, live apart from the world; the elements mould their characters as they shape the rocks. Such virtues as they possess are not the more recondite ones that are acquired or engrafted, but those that are born in them, come direct from nature, or are cultivated by their external conditions. Among simple elemental beings who scarcely realise the distinction between right and wrong. Nature plays so great a part, that the de scriptive passages, in which, for instance, the varied moods of the sea are painted with rare poetic power, cease to be excessive, because they help not only to make up the necessary atmosphere of the picture, but also to create the true impression of the strength of inanimate influences. Nature is not a background, but an actor.1892 NOTICEABLE 695 On this remote island in the Atlantic assemble the joersonce of Miss Lawless's short, simple, and pathetic story. The scene opens with the childhood of Grrania O'Malley—a child who had grown up ' as the seamews grow,' educated, so far as she was educated at all, only by ' the immemorial criss-cross of wishes, hindrances, and circumstances,' strong in her hates as she is intense in her loves, full of the wayward moods and indescribable terrors of childhood. By the side of the twelve-year-old Grania is Murdough Blake, two years older than herself, her playfellow and companion, and later on her affianced husband. Round them turns the plot, if plot it can be called, of the story. But the interest chiefly centres on Grrania and her elder sister Honor, one of those women on whose plain and homely faces religion had set the seal of its beatitude—in character a self- doubting, otherwise all-believing, saint, in appearance as reposeful, serene, and chastened as though she had fulfilled her cherished aspi ration, and lived as a nun within the shelter of a convent. Six years later Grrania had grown into a tall broad-chested maiden, inheriting from her mother a dash of Spanish blood and Spanish beauty, strong, honest, courageous. She and her sister are now orphans, and the death of Honor, who has sunk into a hopeless decline, is fast approaching. Murdough Blake, to whom Grania is engaged, has developed into an Irish Micawber, always waiting for something to turn up, and meanwhile bent on enjoying as much ot the good things of life, including whisky, as Grania or others would provide for him, vain, weak, irresolute, and always building stately castles in the air of which he was the lord and master. Eomance he has none : he scarcely understands what love is : his future marriage is a matter of business. How the course of Grania's love failed to run smoothly, how she tries to conquer it only to find how it has absorbed her nature, how Murdough failed Grania in her supreme hour of trial, how even in her disappointment she clings to him, and how she herself comes to a tragic end—these are Miss Lawless s secrets. But a love story has been rarely told with more perfect delicacy, and a death- struggle seldom described with more pathetic and restrained effect. Grania, Murdough, and Honor are the central figures of the simple drama. For the length of the story it is possible that there are too many subsidiary figures, just as there are scenes which may be deemed superfluous, descriptive passages that, in spite of their remarkable beauty, may appear excessive, and a gloomy atmosphere which may seem too persistently melancholy. has faults—what book has not to the eye of the critic ?—but its defects are far outweighed by its merits. It is a charming story, full of natural life, fresh in style and thought, pure in tone and refined in feeling. E. E. P rothero.696 THE NINETEENTH April 4. ME. BUED'S MACHIAVELLL 1 T he Clarendon edition of tlie Prince closes a long vista of conjecture and controversy. Coming after so many ingenious interpreters, Mr, Burd's plan lias been to illustrate his text with every available passage from the authors known to Machiavelli and every fact from the history of his times. There is not an allusion, not a literary or historical remi niscence, which he has not traced, not a curve in that bewildering line of thought which he leaves unaccounted for. Having supplied us to excess with the means of judging for ourselves, he does not press his own psychology 5 for, when all elements have been considered, and all circumstances brought to bear, the character of the dubious Florentine will continue to be estimated individually according to the allowance each man is in the habit of making for mixture of motive, for religion and policy, for tradition and environment. Mr. Burd is careful not to allow the later development of Machiavellism to divert him from the study of Machiavelli; but he follows the history of interpretation through two centuries, showing how many com mentators have been unintelligent and unjust. Better days have dawned long since; and a dozen years ago the soberest of aca demicians, St. Eene Taillandier, affirmed in the weightiest of reviews that impartial criticism finally pronounces Machiavelli a martyr and a patriot, whose accuser must be an impostor or a fool. The time has passed to which Darwin's words apply, that false views do little harm, as every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness. The torrent of prejudice no longer threatens the footstep of the student, and without effort he makes himself clear of the irritation of one epoch and the apologies of another. Machiavelli wrote in the midst of disaster to himself and the nation, when his party was ruined and the foreigner predominated, north and south. The constellation under which the chief states of central Italy were governed by one family offered chances of achieving the work in which Csesar Borgia, by the accident which disabled him at the crisis of his fate, had lamentably failed. The lesson of his career might yet be made to bear auspicious fruit if the Medici, with twice the resources of the Borgias, could produce a warrior fit to understand it, and cautious in the use of poison. The best thing was an independent republic; the next was a vigorous monarchy. Whether pleading for Csesarism or a Commonwealth, whether thinking of his 1 II Principe. By Niccolo Machiavelli. Edited by L.Arthur Burd. Oxford; Clarendon Press. 1891.1892 NOTICEABLE 697 city or the nation, Machiavelli has always the supreme purposes of a new government before him; and whilst a thousand writers, in their various imperfection, exhibit the quality of freedom, he is above them all in the diagnosis of that dangerous malady, political power. Rescue in extremity was not to be had from a dutiful attention to law; and the man who always prefers the strictness of morality and honour to the public good is rare among the founders of states. There is no acknowledged rule for that which Landor pleasantly calls the removal of an evil at the least possible cost. We do not codify the methods for destroying a tyrant or a noxious demagogue; yet the world has not borne hardly on the memory of Bennigsen and Charlotte Corday. On such a subject, says Coleridge, we never can with propriety decide prospectively, but only retrospectively. Holbach, in politics, is on a level with Montesquieu and Turgot, though in ethics he stands below Helvetius or Feuerbach. Many politicians are no better than Machiavelli, or, as his editor would probably prefer to put it, Machiavelli is nearly as good as numbers of public men, and is decidedly more intelligent. Therefore Mr. Burd esteems that neither entire moral obliquity, nor all the political error to be found in his works, will allow us to discard a writer who, by dispensing with the conventional mask, holds the key to so much history. He will not forgive the clergy the undiscriminating outcry which they raised against the author of the and contrasts the easy temper of the Medici with the severity of Caraffa. Machiavelli saw the Church at its worst, and having measured the incompetence and, as he judged, the insincerity of those Florentines who proclaimed the reign of Christ, he had acquired, like very many of his country men, an entire contempt for religion. Therefore, when the Catholic reaction came, when the works of Savonarola and Erasmus were pro scribed, and their most celebrated contemporaries were read subject to expurgation, he had earned the disrepute into which he fell. Even his earlier accusers were men whose own position was insecure—Pole, who was excluded from the papacy under suspicion as a fautor of heresy; Osorius, who himself did not escape the Index; and Catharinus, the universal censor, whom the Council of Trent was invited to con demn, and whose book, one of the rarest in M^achiavellian literature, Mr. Burd has been almost the first to read. The action of the Council did not tend, as is supposed, to increase the rigour of the prohibitions, but, if anything, to relax it. Many divines recognised the necessity of revising the Eoman Index, of which the Archbishop of Zara said, ' Non ha partorito alcun frutto, se non che ha scoperto infinite difficolta.' The Commissioners struck off some condemned books, and commenced a vast process of expur gation. They sent the proposed alterations to authors from whom they could expect a hearing, because, as they wrote in one case, ' Noi, come giudici benigni, e suoi amorevoli, procureremo di liberarlo di698 THE NINETEENTH April questa nota.' They were divided in regard to Boccaccio, some deeming him incurable, but wishing to recall the censure. The Arch bishop of Ragusa opined: 4 A mio parere era meglio lasciarlo sub silentio, e non ne parlare ne in bene ne in male.' The difficult labour of making the Decameron inoffensive to pious ears was completed in 1573, and after some hesitation the ingenious revision was allowed to appear. Thereupon, on the 3rd of August, the secretary of the Index wrote to Machiavelli's representatives, authorising them to do as much for him, with such omissions as were found sufficient in (xuicciardini. Five years later Victorius informed the Cardinal at the head of the affairs of the Index that the works had been thoroughly revised and waited approbation—' levatone tutto quello che potesse dispiacere alia Santa Romana chiesa.' With increasing rigour it was required that names of ill repute should be cancelled altogether. Students of the classics were not to know that they were reading notes by Camerarius, Stephanus, or other Protestants ' quorum omnium et singulorum ubique prorsus memoria ex quibuscunque libris abradenda est.' A common injunction was: ' Deleantur in primis omnia nomina hsereticorum in toto libro ;' ' Delendum est nomen Molinsei;' ' Dele : Nicolai Macchiavelli.' The family were prepared to suppress a name which concealment could not obscure ; but when at last they were informed that a pseudonym must be substituted for it, they understood that, in the altered times, their labour had become vain ; and the purified Machiavelli, part of which exists in the hands of the Minister of Public Instruction, has never seen the light. This exceptional asperity can hardly have been provoked by the sayings against Rome, because, in the case of Gruicciardini, these were easily got over; nor by the famous argument that Christianity makes inferior citizens, for nearly the same thing may be read in the works of a religious Italian, afterwards Pope : ' Si vide ITtalia decadere total- mente da quanto le aveva procacciato un brillante splendore. . .La mollezza s'impadroni dei corpi e degli spiriti, e la Nazione Italiana divenne effeminata.' But Machiavelli's writings made it apparent that the accepted code of private morality does not govern national and international life. A problem long disguised by confounding property with sovereignty, and church with state, opened like an abyss before the feet of men. Whether politics are a godless occupation, independent of ethics, or possess a distinct morality technically adapted to special needs and conditions, the consequences were as formidable to Rome as the Reformation. A law discovered and fashioned by man threatened to restrict, if it did not supersede, the law revealed by God. There was a new legislator and a usurped authority; and the danger of a rival power, the danger latent in Copernicus, became manifest in Grotius. If a false policy or a foolish tax could do more for the replenishment of Hell than private vice, the laws which direct1892 NOTICEABLE 699 the art of government are invested with an extraordinary prerogative. Therefore, while Machiavelli's early defenders were the men who made politics a science, Grentilis, who detected irony in the and Harrington, who calls its author the Hippocrates of political pathology, at Rome, earnest churchmen like Cardinal Baronius and Pope Paul the Fifth declared politicians professing allegiance to their own scientific system the most perverse of misbelievers: ' La secta de los Politicos, que era la mas contraria heregia que jamas huvo.' When, in the Espritdes Lois, Montesquieu disparages the Inquisition, the great Dominican moralist Concina exclaims: ' Machiavellismus iste non minus politico-civili quam sacro regimini perniciosissimus est.' Although Mr. Burd guards against the mistake by which Villari has overstated the part of Father Possevino in turning opinion against Machiavelli, he is impatient with the Jesuits for their zeal against doctrines which he likens to the morality of their rule. The passage inopportunely quoted, and often quoted heretofore as the signal of later casuistry, the passage with the idiomatic mantrap ' obligare ad peccatum,' does not bear the interpretation assigned ; and the root of those things which Mariana reverently terms the Infirmities of the Society must be looked for elsewhere than in the original Constitutions of the Order. When we are told that nobody could think of morality in the days of Ferdinand the Fifth and Lewis the Twelfth, and that a public conscience did not exist, the hyperbole is intended to rouse sluggish minds to the consideration that society is answerable for its members, and that a character can better be judged by the examples and opinions amid which it was formed than by any fixed principle. The intelligent interest which Machiavelli excites to-day is not due so much to political or religious tendency as to this maxim of recent philosophies. It has done much to moderate judgments, and to make history rational, at some risk to the notions of conscience, responsibihty, and freedom, which apply with greatest fitness to men whose ability and power raise them above their fellows and beyond their age. In the enumeration of the classics who were known to Machiavelli and determined his views of society and state, one or two sentences are indicated as inspired by Thucydides. One of our authorities in this obscure labyrinth of political thought, Leo, couples the two men together as the keenest of all observers, and Daunou approves the opinion that Thucydides influences not isolated passages in Machiavelli, but the entire conformation of his mind: ' Ces observations ne laissent du moins aucun doute sur le soin extreme avec lequel rhistorien modeme avait etudie I'ancien.' The point has scarcely been followed up, even in commenting on the terrible eighteenth chapter. According to Mr. Burd, the low estimate of human nature has more than anything else distorted his judgment; and Mr. Symonds means the same thing when he says that indifference to personal ethics vitiated his political writings with philosophical error.THE NINETEENTH CEN April But we do not know by what road lie came to this belief in the essential depravity of mankind. If it is agreed that he owed nothing to Christian divines, or to the Hellenising Valla, who writes : ' Honestas res inanis et imaginaria,' the question remains whether this funda mental article of his historic faith descended to him from one who was already acknowledged the great model of historians. That the idea of progress was unknown to men in those days, un known to the Eenaissance and the contemporaries of Hythlodseus, is a proposition which may be argued either way. Although the British Museum has been scoured to fill the notes with suggestive and un expected matter, the mode of reference is not always that of the perfect bibliographer. The story that the Bavarian Jesuits made a bonfire of Machiavelli in effigy is taken from Foscolo, who, in another book, is also ViUari's authority. But the report is supposed to come from Scioppius, two centuries earlier ; and as that literary gladiator is strangely unapproachable, it would have been interesting to learn exactly what he knew about it, from a man ha\ing the unique opportunities and energy of Mr. Burd. With an inquirer of so much gravity and truth, who has garnered and winnowed the harvest of all preceding labourers, and crowned it with his own strong hand, a little difference goes a long way. But it is too late for me to come with these objections, for he has already subjected his published volume to the most impartial scrutiny, and has notified me such minute emendations where I saw nothing to amend, as cover a critic with silent confusion. Italians are still intent on the Machiavellian philosophy and the composition of the Prince ; but, in spite of Mr. Burd's scruples, it is not likely that any body, lacking employment, will undertake, again in this generation^ the work which he has done so well. A cton. DR. WESTCOTT ON KELIGIOUS THOUGHT. 1 Anything which the Bishop of Durham publishes is sure to be notice able. It may be said of him, as of another, that ' the dust of his writings is gold.' This little volume makes full proof of the wide learning, finished scholarship and mature wisdom stamped on every thing that proceeds from Dr. Westcott's pen. One cannot, indeed, help regretting the fragmentary character of the book. The design, 1 Essays in the History of Religious By Brooke Foss Westcott, D.D., D.C.L., Lord Bishop of Durham.1892 NOTICEABLE 701 of which the first five essays are portions, and which, as the author tells us, he formed very early in life, was to help towards a better under standing of the Christian creed by exhibiting the religious teaching of the great masters of Hellenic and Roman thought. It is the more to be lamented that this intention has not been fully carried out, since no one, so far as I know, has treated the subject quite in the way which Dr. Westcott proposed. Of course the recognition of a pro phetic element in the teaching of those ancient sages is nothing new. On the contrary, it is as old as Christianity. Clement of Alexandria calls philosophy i a schoolmaster to bring the Hellenic mind, as the law the Hebrews, to Christ.' Nay, St. Paul speaks of one of the poets of the Greeks as ' a prophet of their own.' But no one, I think, has anticipated the Bishop of Durham's design ' to show how far the Gospel satisfies our natural aspirations, and illuminates dark places in our experience,' by tabulating, so to speak, the hopes and the desires, the errors and the silences, of' those wise old spirits, 'as Jeremy Taylor happily calls them, ' who preserved natural reason and religion in the midst of heathen darkness.' Only Plato, ^Eschylus and Euripides are thus treated in the volume before us. The other essays, indeed, especially those on Dionysius the Areopagite and Origen, no doubt illustrate the author's general thought, while they are, assuredly, most suggestive studies of the subjects with which they deal. But I fancy most readers, who have properly grasped the scope of the Bishop s original purpose, would gladly exchange them for the papers on Homer, Heraclitus, Virgil, Epictetus, Plotinus, which he projected and which unfortunately have remained unwritten. The keynote of the book is struck in the quotation from the Epistle to the Hebrews, prefixed to the first Essay, ' On the Myths of Plato': ' They that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.' Plato is here considered not as a philosopher, not as a lawgiver, not as a mystic, but as a prophet inspired, as Quintilian said, 'by the spirit of the Delphic oracle.' The Platonic myth is admirably described by Dr. Westcott as 'a possible material repre sentation of a speculative doctrine, which is affirmed by instinct, but not capable of being established by a scientific process': a description, indeed, not holding true of all the Platonic stories, some of which should rather be termed allegories. Plato knew that principles, so long as they remain abstract, are inoperative; that only when, so to speak, they have been made flesh and have dwelt among us in concrete form, do they exercise much power; that truth must be ' embodied in a tale' if it is to touch the heart. The myths of Plato (Dr. 'Westcott writes) remain an unfailing testimony to the religious wants of man. They show not only that reason, by its logical pro cesses, is unable to satisfy them, but also in what directions its weakness is most apparent and least supportable. They form, as it were, a natural scheme of the questions with which a revelation might be expected to deal—creation, providence V ol . XXXI—N o. 182 3 B*1 702 TEF NINETEENTH April immortality—which, as they lie farthest from the reason, lie nearest to the heart. And in doing this they are so far an unfulfilled prophecy, of which the teaching of Christianity is the fulfilment. I must refer the reader to Dr. Westcott's own pages for the development and proof of this view. Let us go on to glance briefly at the second essay, which deals in a like way with iEschylus. He, our author aptly observes, is the prophet of Greek tragedy, as Sophocles is the artist, and Euripides the realist. Dr. Westcott points out that the Greek play was essentially a religious rite, the Greek theatre a temple, the Greek tragedian a national preacher. This is, of course, familiar to every scholar. But I could almost wish that it had been a little more dwelt upon in a book addressed (id jpopulum. The Greek drama was derived from the more ancient mysteries. It was the exposition in the theatre of the sacred things before kept hidden in the temples. The invention of tragedy was not merely a great literary fact it was also an event of capital importance in the religious history of Hellas. The work of the great masters of the tragic stage was to bring out in relief the deep truths which lived in the old national legends : to reset them in the forms furnished by creative genius : to present the facts of man's existence transfigured and idealised; and thus, as Aristotle tells us, to cleanse the soul by pity and terror. Such was Greek tragedy in general. The burden of iEschylus is the absolute and indefeasible claim of Divine Law upon our obedience, and the inexorableness of its judgments. The Prometheus, the Seven against Thebes, the contain ' a natural testi mony of the soul' to the reality of sin and the inevitable penalty which it carries in itself, and to the need which man has of a Divine deliverer to check and control the consequences of violated law. If Plato tells us what are the aspirations of man, iEschylus tells us what are the requirements of the law of God. Of all the essays in the volume perhaps the most fascinating—at least I speak for myself—is the one on Euripides. It is well worthy of the pains which it cost the author. ' I wrote out,' Dr. Westcott tells us, ' every passage in his extant plays and fragments which seemed to bear upon' his religious teaching. And certainly in the large number of quotations brought together we have abundant material for concluding to the poet's judgment from various points of sight. I suppose the reason of the peculiar charm that Euripides exercises over us is to be found in the' touches of things common' which seem rather to belong to our age than to his. In his breadth of sympathy, in his mastery of the emotions, in his truthfulness to life, he stands alone among the poets of antiquity. ' Euripides, the human, with his droppings of warm tears.' He treated the drama [Dr. Westcott remarks] as Socrates treated philosophy. He brought it to the common concerns of daily experience, to the trials and pas-1892 NOTICEABLE 703 sions of simple men and women. The office of feeling, the oneness .and end of humanity, the completeness of man's future being, the reign of righteousness, existence in God—these were the truths which Euripides felt after. His religious teaching corresponds in a word with that most touching and noble sentence which Plato, in this case perhaps with more than usual truth, quotes from a conyersa- tion with Socrates on the evening of his death. ' In regard to the facts of a future life, a man,' said Phfedo, ' must either learn or find out their nature, or if he can not do that, take, at any rate, the best and least assailable of human words, and, borne on this as on a raft, perform in peril the voyage of life, unless he should be able to accomplish the journey with less risk and danger on a surer vessel—some word divine.' And here I may remind the Bishop of Durham of a fragment of Euripides—very striking and significant, it seems to me—which presents a close analogy with this quotation from Plato, and which he has apparently overlooked: Hefifov pep (pS&gt;s to I s jSouXo/xei'ot? noOevffSkauTov, pt£a kcikcop, tlvo. del jiandpcov evp elv fiox^cavavairavKav. Surely in this aspiration for light which shall reveal the source of human wretchedness and the Deity that will deliver from it, we may hear the voice of the prophetic soul of the great world. Dreaming on things to come. ' Poets,' said Plato, ' utter great and wise things which they them selves do not understand.' W. S. L illy. 6. POEMS BY EMILY DICKENSON. 1 A n American lady, who nearly missed being the most distinguished poetess her country has yet produced, died in middle age some six years ago. In life she was but little known, and rarely even seen. This aloofness, tinged with eccentricity, and possibly attributable to some early sorrow, characterises all she wrote. Her scattered verse has only been published since her death; and such fame as Emily Dickenson has achieved as yet is, therefore, posthumous. She avoided 1 Poems. By Emily Dickenson Boston : Eoberts Brothers.704 THE NINETEENTH April publicity in any form; and this indifference to recognition, I take it, accounts for the imperfection of her verse. I cannot subscribe to the idea that her audacious violation of rhyme, her careless obscurity were wilful. I rather incline to the belief that, writing for herself alone, so long as she committed the thought that burned within her to paper, with some assonance which pleased her ear—or even, in some cases, without it—she was satisfied. She would not have been satisfied that these thoughts, clearly the cries wrung from a passionate, suffering soul, should have been given to the world without further polish. Yet we cannot regret the publication of this little volume. The world is richer by some exquisite lines, some beautiful couplets ; only in one or two instances by a poem which is complete and perfect. But in all, the possession of Imagination—that rarest gift—is con spicuous : Imagination, and a strong individuality, akin to that of no other writer, though at moments there is something that recalls Blake, and, at others, Emily Bronte. The following is a vivid example of her strong conception. One can almost fancy that the writer had before her eyes some grand allegorical design by (jr. Watts when she sat down, and wrote at white heat:— T he O haeiot Because I could not stop for' Death, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held^but just ourselves. And Immortality. We'slowly drove, he knew no haste, And I had put away My labor, and my leisure, too, For his civility. We passed the school where children played, Their lessons scarcely done; We passed the fields of gazing grain: We passed the setting sun. We paused before a house that seemed A swelling of the ground ; The roof was scarcely visible, The cornice but a mound. Since then 'tis centuries; but each Feels shorter than the day I first surmised the horses' heads Were toward eternity. Those five stanzas, though I suppose they cannot be called perfect, inasmuch as the rhymes in the second and fifth must be judged in correct, have a quality which is rare in poetry of any period. Miss Dickenson s gift of seeing, now as in an Apocalyptic vision, now as in a dream of fairyland, is unique among minor minstrels, Her range.1892 NOTICEABLE 105 it is true, is limited: as though the solitary soul only looked out wardly on certain phases of nature, inwardly on certain insoluble problems of life. But in such exquisite poems as the following— exquisite, in spite of its provoking imperfection—one sees how Imagination with her could descend from its lofty pedestal and pipe and frisk away among the meadows to a fanciful tune of its own. T he G eass The grass so little has to do— A sphere of simple green, With, only butterflies to brood, And bees to entertain. And stir all day to pretty tunes The breezes fetch along, And bold the sunshine in its lap, And bow to everything; And thread tbe dews all nigbt, like pearls. And make itself so fine,—- A ducbess were too common For such a noticing. And even wben it dies, to pass In odours so divine, As lowly spices gone to sleep. Or amulets of pine. And then to dwell in sov'reign barns. And dream tbe days away,— The grass so little bas to do, I wish I were the hay! The blemishes in these stanzas are obvious; and the third one seems to me entirely bad; but one pardons a great deal for the sake of the second (in spite of its careless neglect of rhyme), and the last, which contains two exquisite lines. A common singer would have seen no further than the cutting down of the grass, ' which to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven.' Akin to this, but deeper in feeling, is the nearly perfect little song numbered ix. in the collection labelled ' Love.' .. . ■y 1 ,, * i Have you got a brook in your little heart. Where bashful flowers blow. And blusbing birds go down to drink. And shadows tremble so ? ii And nobody knows, so still it flows. That any brook is there; And yet your little draught of life ' ' ' Is daily drunken there.706 THE NINETEENTH April in Then look out for tlie little brook in March, When the rivers overflow, And the snows come hurrying from the hills. And the bridges often go. IV And later, in August it may be. When the meadows parching lie. Beware, lest this little brook of life. Some burning noon go dry! Many of tlie poems, as a whole, are poor, but in nearly all occurs some original thouglit struck out in a finely-turned line. In one, which expresses the intense longing to know how a beloved and absent one died, she asks And was he confident until 111 fluttered out in everlasting well ? and she concludes her tender, anxious catechism thus: Was he afraid or tranquil ? Might he know How conscious consciousness could grow. Till love that was, and love too blest to be Meet,—and the junction be Eternity ? I could quote many more passages showing the pearls that are strung on pack-thread, alongside common beads, throughout these curious poems. But space will only allow me to transcribe two couplets, which are complete in themselves, and which, as the cry of a suffering soul, not bereft of faith, and struggling for resignation, seem to me wonderfully pathetic, in their passionate, child-like sim plicity. I shall know why, when time is over, And I have ceased to wonder why; Christ will explain each separate anguish, In the fair schoolroom of the sky. He will tell me what Peter promised, And I, for wonder at his woe, I shall forget the drop of anguisb That scalds me now, that scalds me now. In the short preface which tells how Miss Dickenson spent years without setting her foot beyond the doorstep of her father's house, Mrs. T. W. Higgenson says : ' In many cases these verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.' That is a very apt image. And yet the last thing that could be said of this volume is that it is ' of the earth, earthy,' H amilton Alofi.1892 NOTICEABLE 701 7. THE SPIKIT OF ISLAM. 1 The religion of Mohammed attracts more attention every year from thoughtful minds of very various bents. If Buddhism must ever possess a superior fascination for the contemplative philosopher, Islam may claim a practical force and importance which are obviously beginning to make themselves felt among fair-minded Christians, and which have had their effect upon those who are responsible for British authority in the East. Of the success of Mohammedanism among the uneducated masses there has never been any doubt since the subject was fairly brought before the public by Mr. Blyden, Mr. Bosworth Smith, and more recently and in a more startling manner by Canon Isaac Taylor. The beneficent influence of Islam upon the morals and social life of the tribes of West Africa has been proved beyond possibility of cavil, and though this is but a partial test of the value of a religion, it is by no means the least important: indeed, those who regard a faith in the light of a police would affirm that it was the most efficient test of all. But we like to feel that there is something more in a religion than the coarser elements which appeal to the uninstructed unimaginative soul. We want to know what the educated Muslim really believes ; how far he holds the same dogmas and performs the same ritual as the Nile boatman or the Mandingo of the Niger; and to what extent this system influences his life for good or evil. To discover this we must search in Egypt and India, in countries, that is to say, where European education may be found combined with Oriental beliefs. And in our search we are bound to be cautiously on our guard against the lukewarm eclectic Muslim, who admires most creeds, and really only professes Islam because it is about as good as the rest. That kind of philosopher is to be met with everywhere, and he is c|uite as useless to the student of genuine Islam as a follower of Mr. Herbert Spencer. One might as well ask for an exposition of patriotism from that other vicious outcome of indifference, the cosmopolite, so called because he loves every other country as little as he does his own. Syed Ameer Ali's new book gives us just what we are in search of. It is to a large extent an expansion of his 1 The Life and Teachings of Mohammed, By Syed Ameer Ali, MA., Barrister-at-law, a Judge of the High Court of Judicature in Bengal, &amp;c» Londoii ? Allen &amp; Co., 1891.708 THE NINETEENTH April Life and Teachings of Mohammed which appeared in 1873, and it contains portions of his Personal La 1880; but so far from being a disadvantage, it is rather a gain to find that opinions, which were boldly set forth nearly twenty years ago, still hold good in the mind of so able, conscientious, and acute a reasoner. For we are not listening to the ingenious elaborations of a trained theologian of the Azhar, or the rant of an hysterical dervish: we have here the well-thought-out reasoning of a judge of the High Court in Bengal, a barrister of English training, and a man of wide reading and culture. Syed Ameer Ali represents what is best among educated Mohammedans, and his views are shared by a considerable body of his brother Indians. The importance of his book, as form ulating the articles of faith and rehgion professed by the most enlightened of our Mohammedan fellow-subjects, cannot easily be overestimated. The whole point of the book may be stated in a few words. Of course there are many side-issues treated, some well and some weakly. There is a well-written outline of the life of the Prophet, in which very little allowance has to be made for the prepossessions of the devout Muslim. The serious subjects of controversy in the career of Mohammed are few, and on most of them we find ourselves entirely in accord with Ameer Ali, who is not disposed to shirk these diffi culties when they arise. But any discussion of such questions would only lead us away from the main position, and it is no less undesirable in a limited space to join issue with our author when he commits himself to numerous errors of fact and deduction in his last four chapters, in which he treats, at second or third hand, and quite in adequately, of the political, sectarian, literary, scientific, and philo sophical influence of Islam, in its contact with divers nations. In these portions of his work Syed Ameer Ali is sometimes ill-informed, and his want of Arabic scholarship does not provide the remedy; while his reading of history is unquestionably perverted by the prejudices of the partisan. These blemishes, however, in no sense detract from the signal importance of the book as an exposition of the educated Muslim's faith. Mistakes in history do not injure the main position, which is briefly this : the defects, the formalism and narrow dogmatism, of modern Islam are not essential to the religion of Mohammed, and do not proceed from the Koran; they are the result of the stereotyping influence of centuries of conventional theologians, commentators, and schoolmen, who have substituted the fixed authority of a church in place of the-exercise of individual judgment. Mohammed created no priestly class, no caste of Brahmans, no authorised intermediaries between man and the Creator. All men, in his system, were equal before Grod, and none need or could approach Him through the offices of another. Every man, therefore, has the right to use his own1892 NOTICEABLE 709 judgment in reading the Scripture. Mohammed himself exhausted the powers of language in trying to induce the Arabs to reason for them selves, to study creation and the law of nature, and draw the inevitable deductions. The Koran itself was always held up by him as a plain book, which he who runs may read; and he maintained that when a •man could not find a clear direction in it for any special emergency, he was bound to use his own judgment. Hence it is claimed that Mohammed was the Apostle of Reason, and assuredly there are few more reasonable books than the Koran, read by the light of common sense. The religion it teaches is the simplest form of theism ; there is nothing miraculous, nothing superstitious ; and its practical pre- 3epts are equally sensible. Eigliteousness (said Moluirnriicd) is not turning your face to the east or the 'west; but he is righteous who believeth in God and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Scripture, and tlie Prophets, and giveth wealth, for the love of God, to his kinsfolk and to orphans, and to the needy and the'son of the road/ and to them that ask, and for the freeing of slaves; and who is instant in prayer, and giveth alms; and those who fulfil their bond when tbey promise, and the patient in adversity and affliction, and in time of violence,—these are they who are true,—these are they who fear God (Kor. ii. 172). Why, then, it will be asked, if Islam provides so reasonable a creed and so wholesome a standard of conduct, are there so many objection able features in the Mohammedanism that we see to-day ? Why is there a certain amount of rank superstition, and why is there a vicious social system ? Syed Ameer Ali's reply is that these are not in the Koran ; they are the fruit of scholasticism, the corrupt glosses of professional theologians and doctors of the law. The present stagnation of the Musulman communities (he says) is principally due to the notion whicb has fixed itself on the minds of the generality of Mos lems, that the right to the exercise of private judgment ceased with the early legists, that its exercise in modem times is sinful, and that a Moslem, in order to be regarded as an orthodox follower of Mohammed, should belong to one or other of the schools established by the schoolmen of Islam, and abandon his judgment absolutely to the interpretations of men who lived in the ninth century and could have no conception of the necessities of the nineteenth. . . . The lives and con duct of a large number of Moslems at the present day are governed less by the precepts and teaching of the Master, and more by the theories and opinions of the muj tabids and imams who have tried, each according to his lights, to construe the revelations vouchsafed to the Teacher. . . . They forgot that the Prophet, from the pinnacle of his genius, had spoken to all humanity. They mixed up the tem porary with the permanent, the universal with the particular. . . . Most of the rules which now govern the conscience of so many professors of the faith are hardly derived from any express and positive declaration of the Koran, but for the most part from the lego-religious books. This is perfectly true, ' Just as the Hebrews deposed their Pentateuch in favour of the Talmud, so the Moslems have abolished the Koran in favour of the traditions and decisions of the learned.' V OL . XXXI—N O . 182 3 C710 THE NINETEENTH April It is astonishing how few of the formal rites and even dogmas of mediaeval and modern Islam are to be found laid down in the Koran. Definite enough in its main teaching, it is the vaguest book in the world in lesser points of doctrine and forms ; and if a coach and four may be driven through the statute book, there is no conceivable vehicle too cumbrous to be manoeuvred through the many open gates of the Mohammedan Scripture. But it is in no such spirit of evasion that Syed Ameer Ali declares that the law of the Koran does not provide for the final settlement of various details of social and religious conduct. He is a strict believer in the inspiration of the holy book and the superiority of the teaching of Mohammed over all other religions, and he would not wilfully minimise any express ordinance of his master's. He simply states a fact when he says that many of these minor elements of modern Islam are not in the Koran and therefore are not articles of faith. Still, there are a certain number of regulations which are in the Koran but which hardly accord with the standard of modern ethics, and so honest a thinker as Syed Ameer Ali would be the last to ignore them. He admits the difficulty frankly enough, and argues that it is due entirely to the limitations and peculiarities of the people to whom the Koran was spoken; that the minor ordinances in question, when not too vague to be capable of definition, are rules and regulations enunciated for the common exigencies of the day, in an infant society. But to suppose that the greatest Eeformer the world has ever produced, the greatest upholder of the sovereignty of Reason, the man who proclaimed that the world was governed and guided by law and order, and that the law of nature meant progressive development, ever contemplated that even those injunctions which were called forth by the passing necessities of a semi-civilised people should become immutable to the end of the world, is doing an injustice to the Prophet of Islam. And again; The wonderful adaptability of the Islamic precepts to all ages and nations; their entire concordance with the light of reason; the absence of all mysterious doc trines to cast a shade of sentimental ignorance round the primal truths implanted in the human breast;—all prove that Islam represents the latest development of the religious faculties of our being. Those who have ignored the historic significance of some of its precepts have deemed that their seeming harshness or inadaptability to present modes of thought ought to exclude it from any claim to universality. But a little inquiry into the historic value of laws and precepts, a little more fair ness in the examination of facts, would evince the temporary character of such rules, as may appear scarcely consonant with the requirements or prejudices of modern times The catholicity of Islam, its expansiveness, and its charity to all KX 0 Sriv«^eh' erl7 mistaken ' perTerted ' or Wilfu ^ C01KeaM We are not prepared to follow Syed Ameer Ali implicitly in all he addnces m snpport of his argument. As a MnsUm he natnrally assumes a wider grasp and foresight in his Prophet than we are dis-1892 NOTICEABLE 711 posed to allow him ; and in dealing, for instance, with one of the most prominent of what he calls ' temporary enactments,' polygamy, he undoubtedly makes too little of such a glaring defect as Mohammed's personal uxoriousness. This cannot be wholly explained away, and has certainly exercised an unwholesome influence on his disciples in all ages, which the actual sanction of polygamy in the Koran might not by 'tself have exercised. Strange as it may seem, all the Koran teaches on this subject is this : If ye fear that ye cannot do justice between orphans, then marry such women as are lawful to you, by twos, or threes, or fours ; and if ye fear ye cannot be im partial, then only one, or what [slaves] your right hands possess : that is the chief thing, that ye be not unfair (Kor. iv. 3). On this enigmatic remark is the Mohammedan system of four wives founded! So obscure is it that worthy Muslims have been found who interpreted it to mean .that they might marry wives in batches of two or three or four at a time, and have acted religiously up to their interpretation; whilst others have added ' two or three or four ' together, to their entire satisfaction. But in face of Moham med's own example, Syed Ameer Ali cannot reasonably contend that it is a misrepresentation and a ' reprehensible mistake' to say that the Prophet either ' adopted or legalised polygamy.' He did both, and probably rightly, considering the times and the people: whether he meant the system to be perpetuated is another matter. If many Muslims agree with Syed Ameer Ali in denouncing polygamy as 'an adulterous connection,' disavowing divorce, and disapproving of the seclusion of women, we shall soon see a change in the social state of Islam. Ninety-five per cent, of the Indian Musulmans are monogamists, and everywhere in the countries of Islam polygamy is the exception; but this is usually due to economy or some such cause. Let it be from principle, as in Ameer Ali's case, and Islam will go upwards a long step on the ladder of civilisation. Our object, however, is not so much to criticise, as to emphasise the singular interest and significance of the position taken up in this book. A devout and strict Mohammedan of high intellectual powers and European education has here explained his faith, and vindicated the right of private judgment against the dictates of orthodox tradition. He puts his case with singular ability and straightforwardness, and his exposition of the views of educated Muslims in modern India must possess a high value to all who are able to appreciate their importance both to England and to the East at large.

Mr Julius M.Price, the special artist of the I London iVews, has written an account of his recent travels in the East under the title of ' From the Arctic Ocean to the Yellow Sea.' Mr Price is the first traveller, so far as is known, who has made the journey right across Asia, from the Arctic Ocean to the Pacitic, In his dual capacity of artist-correspondent he sailed in July 1890, with an expedition from Blackwall to Siberia, the Arctic Ocean and the Kara Sea to the mouth of the Yenesei Eiver, thence by a small steamer 1,500 miles up the River to Yeneseisk. There he left his companions and made the journey alone across Siberia bv sledge, halting for considerable periods at the cities of Krasnoiarsk, Irkutsk, and Kiakhta. He then proceeded across the frontier of Mongolia to the sacred city of Ourga, and from there across the Desert of Gobi to Kalgan, within the boundaries of China. From Kalgan Mr. Price then went on in a mule litter to Peking, and thence on to Shanghai, where he caught a steamer for Yokohama. It will thus be seen of what a varied description his experiences have been. The most interesting part of his work is, perhaps, that which relates to Siberia. It would seem that Mr. Price's observations point to a different conclusion from that arrived at by ^ r ' The^vork will be in one volume, lavishly illustrated, and one of the engravings will be a reproduction from a sketch given to Mr. Price by an artist who was in exile in Siberia.

The few who knew him intimately were aware that he was a most charming companion, and that as a letter- writer he was distinguished by droll humour and genial outspoken criticism, and this renders his correspondence peculiarly attractive.

The sum remaining for division among the assured, viz., which was larger by £40,000 than any previous one, provided a Cash Bonus averaging 35 per cent, on the premiums of the quinquennium, being the largest Cash Bonus ever declared by the Society. Branch Offices:—MANSION HOUSE BUILDINGS, E.G.;MW INVALID LIVES it- T HE practice of granting Policies on 'Invalid' lives— i .e., lives below the average standard, either from personal defect or hereditary taint—was established by the CLERICAL, MEDICAL AND GENERAL LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY in 1824, and has been successfully continued to the present time. Much of this success is due to the fact that the Bonus System of the Society as applied to these Policies has been devised—and in this respect it stands almost alone—to ameliorate and, should the life be prolonged beyond the estimate, ultimately to nullify the original surcharge. By the aid of the subjoined table of Bonuses actually allotted at the present division this will be made clear. Specimens of Bonuses allotted to Policies of £1000. January 1892. Duration of Policy.

A man of the real age of 40, for example, if charged the premium for age 50, would be allotted from time to time the larger Bonuses shown in the Table as given at age 50, These, it will be seen, are not only larger in themselves, but each of Bonus produces a larger reduction of premium. On the assumption that like Bonuses will be given in future about which, of course, no pledge can possibly be given—a man entering at the real age of 4°) charged the rate for age 50, will at the end of 10 years have to pay a smaller premium (viz.: £31 : 3 : 4) than the healthy premium at 40 (viz.; £32 I 10 : o), and thus from that time be more than freed from the original surcharge. In 10 years more he will have to pay an absolutely less premium (viz,. £g . 13 . 4) than if lie had been treated at the outset as a healthy life, when the reduced premium would have been £14 : 13 : 4. And, finally, at the end of 25 years, not only will his premium be extinguished, but a Bonus will attach to the Policy,—a condition he would not nearly have reached had he been treated as a healthy life at entry and charged the premium for his real age. The effect is even more striking when the reductions allotted to a man entering at other assumed ages (for example, 60) are compared with those granted to one entering at 50. {See full Prospectus.*) 8 EXCHANGE STREET, MANCHESTER; 3 BENNETT'S HILL, BIRMINGHAM. .V ■. / ■■#v ■iiiiii ^ CLERICAL, MEDICAL AND GENERAL LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY. Assurance at prime cost. One of the wants of the present day is a table of whole- life premiums, which, while making the least possible demand on the resources of the Assured, shall at the same time admit the Policies to full Bonus advantages. The annexed table of reduced premiums, which are believed to be lower than any hitherto published , has been framed to meet this want. Being below the mathematical premiums for the several risks provided in the Society's full premiums, these reduced premiums may properly be said to supply 'assurance at prime cost.' They depend on the realization of a certain ratio of profit, and in the event of the profit at any division being insufficient, the sum assured by any particular policy will need to be charged with payment of such a sum as will make good its share of the deficiency, unless the Assured prefer to pay off the balance due to the Society. So large, and so consistent, however, have been the profits of this Society, that there is little likelihood of any such deficiency arising. The new premiums, which are payable annually, are at all ages 75 per cent, only of the ordinary whole-life, with profit rates, the Society advancing the remaining 25 per cent. The 25 per cent, so provided by the Society, accumulated at 5 per cent, interest in advance, will be a charge on the current bonus. If death should occur within the quin quennial bonus period, the interim bonus will exactly meet the current charge, and allow of the sum assured being paid without deduction. If,on the other hand, the Policy should survive the quinquennial period and share in the declared bonus, it may be expected that the cash bonus allotted at each division will more than meet the current charge. This suiplus cash bonus may, on its declaration, either be at once received by the Assured, or, if he prefer it, be converted into an equivalent Reversionary Bonus, payable with the sum assured in the event, and in the event only, o f death occurring subsequently to the attainment of an age to be stated in the Policy. ~ ~ Further particulars as to the Prime Cost NE o T fl .
