There are no traces of a rear pillar. He wears a short, close-fitting wig of rectangular rows of curls, which leaves his modeled ears uncovered. He originally wore a short kilt, but now only the top of it is preserved, to be found at his back. His eyelids are carved. His pectorals are indicated, and he possesses a bipartite torso. His arms are close to his body. Other than being broken above the waist, this piece is well preserved.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/11033", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, Paris and New York, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquistion unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "9th-10th Dynasty", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2010-03-29T16:23:59.513", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_22.377_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_22.377_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_22.377_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_22.377_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_22.377_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL2_22.377_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
