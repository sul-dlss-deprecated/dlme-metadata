All stations shall answer calls directed to them by other stations in the aero nautical radio service and shall exchange com munications on request. • Logs shall be retained for a pe- r -°^ u at i Last, thirty days, and for longer pe riods should they be required in connection with inquiries or investigations. 2.14.8. The following information is re quired to be entered in logs: 1) The name of the agency operating the station. ^ 2 ii 5 ’ 2 '. , A11 . station s shall exchange tramc with the minimum of radiated ener- gy necessary to ensure good communica- ^ tion. 2.15.3. Before proceeding with any trans mission, the sending station shall make certain that it will not cause harmful interference with other communications in progress within its normal communication area. If interference is likely, the station wishing to send shall waitCOM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 14 until other communications are terminated, unless it has higher priority traffic. When higher priority traffic is on hand, the station holding such traffic may interrupt communica tions in progress at the end of a message.^ The stations in communication shall immediately give way to the interrupting station. The in terrupting station shall not continue communica tion longer than necessary to transmit the prio rity traffic for which the interruption was made. 2.15.4. Communications in progress, which are not of an emergency nature, may be interrupted at any time for the transmission of emergency or distress communications. 2.16.—Abbreviations to be Used With the exception of message texts, only the abbreviations authorized by ICAO for use in the aeronautical telecommunication service shall be used. 3—Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Service 3.1.—Hours of Service 3.1.1. Stations of the aeronautical fixed telecommunication service shall keep scheduled contacts or continuous watch as necessary for flight operations and as long as messages aw'ait transmission. 3.1.2. Before closing down, a station shall notify its intention to all other stations of the fixed service with which it communicates directly, confirm that all traffic has been cleared, and advise the time of re-opening, if other than as scheduled. 3.1.3. When a station has been working continuously as a part of a network on a common frequency, it shall send a general call (CQ) with the statement that it intends to close down. It shall then listen for two minutes and may close down, if it has received no call during this period. 3.2.—Routing of Messages 3.2.1. Under normal circumstances, all communications shall be routed by the most rapid means in order to reach the desired destina tion. 3.2.2. Alternative routing arrange ments shall be made, when necessary, to expedite the movement of communication traffic. 3.3.—Failure of Communications 3.3.1. Should communication on a nor mal circuit fail, the station concerned should attempt to re-establish contact as soon as prac ticable. 3 . 3 . 1 . 1 . If this proves unsuccessful, or if abnormal delays in fixed service communica tions are encountered, efforts should be made to relay traffic via any station with which commu nication is possible. 3.3.2. Should a failure occur on a radio circuit, an appropriate alternate should be used and a listening watch should be maintained on the fixed service frequency normally in use. A series of the letter V followed by the call sign of the transmitting station should be transmitted at regular intervals for periods of not longer than three minutes. If these attempts fail, the ground- air frequencies in use at the time may be used as an exceptional and temporary measure. 3.3.3. If it is impossible to dispose of traffic over the fixed service within a reasonable period, other means shall be considered. Consi deration should also be given to the possibility of effecting earlier delivery by holding traffic until the service is restored. 3.3.3.1. When traffic is held at the place where it was handed in (filed), the originator shall be consulted regarding further action to be taken.COM Procedur es for Air Navigation Services 15 3.3.3.2. If traffic is being held at a relay station or any station other than the one where it was handed in, the originator shall, if possible be consulted regarding further action to be t a k^n. If this is not possible and if it is consi- dAed necessary to forward the traffic by other iru^ns, this shall be done in the absence of other specific arrangements. 3.4.—Acceptance of Messages 3 . 4.1 Only those communications com ing within the categories herein listed will nor mally be transmitted via the communication system of the fixed service. 3.4.2. The responsibility for determin ing the acceptability of a message shall rest with the station where a message is originally handed in. When a message is accepted it shall be trans mitted, relayed and/or delivered without delay. 3.4.3. The controlling authority at any station through which a message passes is free to make representations, subsequently, to the controlling authority at the accepting station regarding any message which is considered un acceptable for transmission. 3.4.4. Only messages for stations form- mg part of the aeronautical telecommunication network shall be accepted for transmission, except where special arrangements have been made. 3.4.5. Messages handled for airline operating agencies shall be accepted only when presented to the telecommunication station in the lorm prescribed herein and by an authorized representative of that agency, or when received irom that agency over an authorized circuit. 3.4.6. Airline operating agencies shall retrain from using the aeronautical fixed service when other means of communication are ade quate. 3.4.7. However, where there is no satis- actory access to commercial telecommunication acuities, or where the commercial telecommuni cation service is not sufficiently rapid, the admin- istrations or authorities concerned should make the necessary arrangements to permit airline operating agency traffic to be passed over the channels of the aeronautical fixed telecommuni cation service. 3.5.—Composition of Messages 3.5.1.—Component Parts order • meSSageS comprise ’ in the Allowing 1) Message circuit number, addressee check number, and call sign of transmitting station. 2 ) Preamble. 3) Address. 4) Text. 5) Signature group (if required). 3.5.2.I. ^ Message circuit numbers are numbers assigned in sequence by the telecommu nication agency to all messages transmitted directly from one station to another station. . ‘ • T* separate series ol message cir cuit numbers should be maintained for each cir- cmt, and a new series of numbers should be started daily at 0000 hours. 3.5.2.3.

A multiple address message shall bear only one message identification group which shall be retained throughout. ^ 3.6.5. If a message containing addresses for local delivery and also requiring retransmis sion is received, the address shall be amended by deleting, where practicable, the local addresses before retransmission. Should an originator so require, a list of all addressees may be included at the head of the text of the original message and shall remain in the text as relayed to all stations, so that all recipients may know who has received the message. 3.6.6. When the originator desires to differentiate between the addresses listed in the text who are particularly concerned with the contents of the message, and the addresses to whom it is supplied for information only, the word COPY (abbreviation CY) shall be used to separate the two categories. The latter category shall then follow the abbreviation CY. transmitting station group shall be assigned for each receiving station. 3.7.2. The call sign of each receiving station shall be included in the address, preced ing the addresses for which that station is re sponsible.

Reservation messages are in tended to enable operating agencies to secure the space required in public transport aircraft. 3.8.8.1. Service messages are used by stations of the fixed service to obtain informa tion or verification concerning other messages which appear to be incorrect. They may also be used for arranging communication schedules, selecting or changing frequencies, confirming message circuit numbers, etc. 3. 8 . 8 . 2 . Service messages require rapid handling and demand an immediate reply. When they refer to messages, they shall, ordinarily, be assigned an order of transmission similar to the message to which they refer. This shall be done by inserting the appropriate service prefix after SER. 3. 8 . 8 .3. A service message shall not be used to query the contents of a message for rea sons other than suspected errors in transmission. 3. 8 . 8 .4. The preamble of a service mes sage shall include the service prefix SER fol lowed, if it refers to a message, by the service prefix of that message. Example Service message transmitted by Miami WBR to San Juan WRW: Message circuit number, etc 10/1WBR SER OPN Preamble MIA CE10 9 291706 Address SJU CE Text YR MA23/29 CFM LAST TEXT WD MAGENTO Signature group 291702COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 21 * * 3. 8 . 8 .5. When a service message refers to a message previously handled, it shall be ad dressed to the station of origin. In such cases reference to the message previously handled shall be made by use of the message identification g^ip and the date. 3. 8 . 8 . 6 . A reply to a service message shall be addressed to the station which originated the initial service message and shall be composed in the same form. The text of all service messages shall be as brief as possible. 3.8 ; 8.7. A copy of each service message pertaining to previously handled traffic shall be attached to the file copy of the message to which it refers. 3.8.9.—Transmission of Duplicate Messages If a message which has previously been trans mitted correctly has to be duplicated for the purposes of communication service, it shall be transmitted with advice that it is a duplicate- this shall be indicated by the transmission of the abbreviation DUPE as the first item of the pre amble. A numbered message duplicated on the same day shall carry its original message circuit number. Messages duplicated on subsequent days shall carry new message circuit numbers. All duplicated messages shall bear the original date-time groups. 3.8.10.—Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) Notices to Airmen (abbreviated: Nls) are messages or notices giving aero nautical information usually in a standard se quence. Such notices normally contain informa tion concerning the establishment, condition, or change in any: 1 ) aid to air navigation; 2 ) aerodrome or landing area; 3) hazard to air navigation; 4) services, procedures or regulatory re quirements relating to air navigation. 3.8.10.2 ; NOTAMs should be coded, when possible, in the NOTAM Code contained in Communication Codes and Abbreviations, Doc 2560-COM/164. 3.9.—Priorities • • f ^ pnunLy in uxe trans mission of messages in the aeronautical service is as follows: 1 ) Message s be aring the priority prefix SOS 2 ) Messages bearing the priority prefix SVH ' 3) Messages bearing the priority prefix URGENT • , . j to be followed, if necessary, by the serv ice prefix. 4) Messages bearing the service prefix EXC. 5) Messages bearing the service prefix CTL. 6 ) Messages bearing the service prefix AMT. 7) Messages bearing the service prefix DEP. 8 ) Messages bearing the service prefix CHG. 9) Messages bearing the service prefix OBS. 10 ) Messages bearing the service NOTAM. * prefix 11) Messages bearing the service prefix PEN. 12 ) Messages bearing the service prefix ARR. 13) Messages bearing the service prefix CNL. 14) Other messages (OPN, MET, DEL,RES etc.). ’ 3.9.2. When justified by their impor- tance, messages in the fixed service may be pre ceded by the priority prefix URGENT The priority prefix URGENT shall not be used on reservation messages. 3.10.-—Manual Radio-Telegraph Operating Procedure 3.10.1.—Transmitting Technique Each operator shall transmit each character clearly and distinctly, and with proper separa tion. The length and spacing of characters shall be consistent with the overall speed of transmis-22 COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services sion using automatic transmission as a criterion. The speed of transmission shall be governed by the prevailing receiving conditions and the capability of the receiving operator. 3.10.2.—Station Identification Each station shall be identified by its radio call sign. 3.10.2.1. Identification during extended transmissions. —No special transmission of sta tion identification shall be required during an exchange of messages. The message preamble and message acknowledgments provide such identification. 3.10.3.—Calling 3.10.3.1. The calling station shall transmit the radio call sign of the station called once, the word DE, its own radio call sign once, and the appropriate message prefix (priority or service) followed by the signal K. The radio call signs may be transmitted as many as three times, if conditions appear so to require. 3.10.3.2. Unanswered calls shall not be repeated more frequently than once per minute, and then only if such calls do not interfere with communications in progress. 3.10.3.3. A call may be followed by the service abbreviation (Q signal) indicating the frequency which the calling station proposes to use for transmission, if it is other than that on which the call is made. 3.10.3.4. The call CQ not followed by the signal K (general call to all stations without request for reply) is used for messages in the scheduled broadcast service and for information of any kind intended to be read by any one who is able to do so. 3.10.3.5. Multiple call. — When calling more than one station, the radio call signs of the stations called shall be transmitted in any con venient sequence and preceding the word DE. When making a multiple call, the signal K shall take the place of the message prefix which shall be given to the respective stations after they have answered. 3.10.4.—Replying 3.10.4.1. When the called station is pre pared to copy the proffered message, it shall reply by transmitting its owm radio call sign onse, followed by the signal K. When the called &gt; tion is not prepared to copy the proffered mes sage, it shall transmit, if and when practicable, its radio call sign, and the signal AS followed by the signal AR. The signal AS may be followed by a figure representing the approximate delay in minutes or by a brief explanation of the reason for delay such as QRL 4200 (meaning: “I am busy on 4200 kc/s.”)* 3.10.4.2. Stations replying to a multiple call shall answer, as a general rule, in the order in which they were called. 3.10.4.3. When a station hears a call with out being certain that such call is intended for it, it shall not reply until the call has been repeated and is understood. When a station receives a call which is addressed to it, but is uncertain of the call sign of the calling sta tion, it must reply immediately using the signal 1 MI in place of the call sign of this latter station. 3.10.4.4. If the calling station has indi cated that it will transmit on a frequency other than that on which it made the call, the station called, if in agreement, shall reply by transmit ting the service abbreviation (Q signal) to indic ate that it is changing to the frequency an nounced. 3.10.4.5. If the station called is not in agreement to use, either for transmission or re ception, the frequency announced by the calling station, it must make knowm by means of the appropriate service abbreviation (Q signal) the frequency or frequencies it wishes to be used. 3.10.5.—Message Indicators In the call, message indicators may be used to permit preparation for the copying of mes sages. The indicator, when used, shall imme diately follow the message prefix. 3.10.5.1. The following message indicators shall be used: 1) TRU — To indicate a message which is to be relayed. If relay is to be made to moreCOM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 23 than one station, a number shall be added to indicate the number of stations to which relay is to be made. 2) RT—To indicate a message for local |delivery at the receiving station and which the receiving station is also to relay. When relay to more than one station is to be made, a number shall be added to indicate the num ber of stations to which relay is to be made. 3) MC—To indicate a message which re quires multiple copy for delivery to a number of addressees at the receiving station. It shall be followed by a number indicating the num ber of addressees to which delivery is to be made. 3.10.6.—Servicing Transmitted Messages Transmitted messages shall show the time of transmission, operator’s identification symbol, message circuit number, call sign of the receiving station, and, unless recorded elsewhere, the fre quency used. 3.10.7.—Recording of Unusual Delays, Failures to Receive, etc. Unusual circumstances will arise occasionally which require explanation regarding delay of a message, failure to receive acknowledgment of receipt, etc. In such cases, the operator shall explain the circumstances briefly on the face of the message or, if necessary due to lack of space, on the reverse side of the message. 3.10.8.—Message Transmission Messages shall be transmitted exactly as written. Abbreviations may not be substituted for clear language. The complete text and signa ture shall be t ransmitted without modification. The signal BT shall be transmitted immediately preceding the preamble, address, text and signa ture group of each message. 3.10.9.—Acknowledgment of Receipt A receiving operator shall not transmit an acknowledgment of receipt until he is satisfied that the received message is correct in form, including proper message circuit number(s), correct number of words (when a word count appears), etc. Correct receipt of a message shall be acknowledged by transmitting the radio call sign of the station acknowledging receipt; the signal R, followed by the number of the message; and the signal AR or K. Where acknowledgment of receipt is given to more than one message, only the number of the last message correctly received shall follow the signal R. 3.10.10.—Recording Received Messages Received messages shall be recorded while being received. 3.10.11.—Servicing Received Messages The receiving operator shall enter a service endorsement on each received message. The service endorsement shall consist of the receiving operator’s identification symbol, the designator of the frequency on which the message was received, if not recorded elsewhere, and the time at which reception was completed. 3.10.12.—Dating Messages Each message handled by an aeronautical station shall have recorded on its face the date or dates on which the message was handled. If all handling occurs on the date shown in the message preamble, no other dating is required. 3.10.13—Break-in Procedures “Break-in” is defined as the process of inter rupting or attempting to interrupt the transmis sions of another station. Break-in shal l be ac complished by transmitting the signal BK fol lowed by a short listening period to determine whether interruption has been accomplished. If three attempts to break-in do not accomplish the desired interruption, the breaking operator should refrain from further attempts until the message being transmitted has been completed. 3.10.13.1. Break-in procedure {without emer gency): 1) A transmitting station shall not normally be interrupted during transmission of a mes sage, except in special cases or to request the transmitting station to repeat a portion of the24 COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services message being received by the breaking operator. 2) A transmitting station may be inter rupted between messages, or during long pe riods of transmission, when the breaking operator desires to transmit messages of a higher priority than the messages being trans mitted at the time of interruption. 3.10.13.2. Break-in procedure {in entergen- cy). —When emergency transmissions are to be made and other transmissions are in progress, the operator may make any transmission which he believes necessary to interrupt the transmis sions in progress. Immediately after the inter ruption has been effected, the breaking operator shall transmit an appropriate signal indicating the existence of an emergency. Thereafter com munication shall be conducted in the manner indicated by the prevailing conditions. 3.10.14.—Error Signal In case of error during transmission of a word, the transmitting operator shall transmit the error signal; the last group correctly transmitted before the error; the correction; and then shall continue with the transmission. 3.10.15.—End of Transmission Normally every transmission shall end with either the signal AR, if no response is required, or the signal K, if a response is required. 3.10.15.1. When only two stations are in communication, the station having completed transmission of all messages on hand shall so indicate by transmitting its own call sign fol lowed by the signal AR, or the signal K. 3.10.15.2 When more than two stations are in communication, the transmitting station shall indicate the end of its traffic for a partic ular station by the word NIL, the call sign of the latter, followed by the signal K. After that sta tion has acknowledged receipt, transmission may be resumed to the other stations. 3.10.15.3. Stations communicating regular ly with each other may dispense with the use of signals (AR, K, etc.) when no confusion will result.

AR3.11.—Automatic Radio-Telegraph Operating Procedure 3.11.1.—Difference from Manual Operation Automatic operation differs from manual operation in that equipment is usually kept in readiness for reception without the normal cal ling and answering procedures. 3.11.2.—Marking Transmissions 3.11.2.1. Marking transmissions are made for the purpose of keeping equipment properly tuned and the circuit ready for instant opera tion. 3.11.2.2. Marking transmissions shall be made by transmitting the letter V nine times in three groups of three, followed by the call sign of the transmitting station sent three times with each complete marking group separated by three spaces: Example: VVV VVV VVV EIP EIP EIP WV VVV VVV EIP EIP EIP 3.11.2.3. If marking transmissions are being made on two or more frequencies simul taneously, using the same automatic keying head, the frequency bands (in megacycles) on which the transmission is being made shall be indicated: Example: WV VVV VVV WEK WEK WEK 8/13 WV WV VVV WEK WEK WEK 8/13 . 3.11.2.4. Marking transmissions during idle periods shall be at a rate of twenty words per minute. 3.11.3.—Speed 3.11.3.1. The transmission speed of traf fic on automatic circuits shall be governed by the amount of traffic to be handled and by the capabilities of the receiving equipment, circuit conditions and operating personnel. Before com- COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services mencing transmission the operating speed should be agreed between the stations concerned. 3.11.3.2. Depending upon conditions, words may be transmitted twice. ^ 3.11.3.3. The term “words per minute” refers to the reading of the tachometer of the keying-head drive without regard to the compo sition of the transmitted material. The word PARIS perforated consecutively, with each word separated by one space, may be used in preparing tapes for the purpose of calibrating the tachometer. 3.11.3.4. The term “groups per minute” may be used to indicate the speed at which ma terial composed entirely, or predominantly, of figures is transmitted. The speed of transmis sion in groups per minute may be determined by perforating the desired number of figure groups, each consisting of five figures, with one space separation between groups, and adjusting the keying-head drive to transmit the required number of groups through the keying-head in one minute. 3.11.3.5. The shift from marking trans mission to traffic transmission shall be made by increasing the speed of marking to normal traf fic speed for approximately five seconds. The marking tape shall then be lifted from the key ing head and dots transmitted for approximately five seconds before the traffic tape is inserted. This procedure will warn the receiving station and allow time for adjustment of the receiving equipment to normal traffic speed. 3.11.4.—Correction of Errors in Transmission (RQ and BQ Procedure) 3.11.4.1. All transmissions on automatic circuits should be made from perfectly perfor ated tape, or from tape in which all errors de tected in perforation have been perfectly patched out. Should errors or imperfect transmission be detected, correction shall be made by lifting the tape from the keying-head and transmitting the corrections manually. The tape shall then be reset, so that the incorrect portion is not re transmitted. When manual correction is not practicable, the correction shall be sent at the end of the transmission. 3.11.4.2. Corrections by h and shall be made by transmitting the signal IMI, the lastCOM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 27 group correctly transmitted before the error, the correction, and three groups beyond the cor rected portion. The tape shall then be reset three groups back from the last group trans mitted by hand. % Example Mutilated or garbled groups: 12345 67/?4 14567 98764 12547 Transmission by hand: IMI 12345 67345 14567 98764 12547 Tape reset: 14567 98764 12547 (etc.) 3.11.4.3. If corrections are made by patch ing, marking transmissions shall be started when the tape is removed from the keying-head. When ready to resume transmission, the tape shall be reset at least three groups from the last group correctly transmitted. 3.11.4.4. All requests for corrections and fill-ins shall be made by means of RQ. All re plies to an RQ shall be made by means of a BQ. RQ and BQ shall be used only by stations main taining direct communication with each other and shall not be relayed to other stations. RQ and BQ shall not carry serial numbers, but shall be retained and attached to the file copy of the message to which they refer. 1) Example of an “RQ' requesting fill-ins: WSY DE CTI RQ YOUR 10/13 AA? DEPARTMENT (“10/13” means “message circuit number 10 on the 13th”.) 2 ) Example of a “BQ' replying to the above “RQ': CTI DE WSY BQ OUR 10/13 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 3.11.4.5. RQ and BQ shall be given imme diate attention and handled in accordance with the priority of traffic to which they refer. 3.11.5.—Break-in Procedure 3.11.5.1. The receiving station may break in on the transmitting station only to advise that equipment is not functioning properly or that transmissions are so mutilated that trans cription and fill-ins would not be justified. 3.12.—Teletypewriter Operating Procedure 3.12.1.—General 3.12.1.1. Station identification .—Each tele typewriter station shall be assigned a call sign for identification. When a radio teletypewriter station is part of an aeronautical telecommunica tion station which has an assigned radio call sign, that sign shall also identify the radio tele typewriter station. 3.12.1.2. Priority bell signal .—The follow ing bell signal is authorized to precede transmis sion of distress, urgent or safety messages, and none other shall be used: 3 bells {pause) — 3 bells {pause) — 3 bells. 3.12.2.—Manual and Automatic Circuit Procedure 3.12.2.1. A teletypewriter station shall not interrupt another station’s transmission except: 1 ) to transmit a distress, urgent or safety message, when a message of lower priority is being transmitted; 2 ) to inform the transmitting station that the receiving station cannot receive the trans mission in progress. 3.12.2.2. The line feed function on all teletypewriters shall be adjusted to double space. 3.12.2.3. The first character of any mes sage shall be FIGURES (FIGS) if the first printed character is an upper case, and LETTERS (LTRS) if it is a lower case. 3.12.2.4. Carriage Return and Line Feed impulses shall be preceded by a Letters Shift impulse if following an upper case transmission. This procedure is essential for receipt of readable copy at the receiving station, and ensures that relays to international circuits are intelligible. 3.12.2.5. A Carriage Return and at least six Line Feed impulses shall be transmitted im mediately after the termination group of a message.28 COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 3.12.2.6. Delayed corrections: 1 ) Appropriate Q signals or service mes sages may be used to request or furnish repeti tions, verifications or corrections after an interval has elapsed following the transmission of a message. 2) If the transmitting station has to refer to the originator or previous station to answer a check or query raised by-the receiving sta tion, it shall indicate this to the receiving sta tion by the abbreviation CTF. The receiving station will then retransmit or deliver the message with CTF followed by the words queried inserted after the signature group. 3.12.2.7. Transmission of messages in series: 1) When stations have several messages to transmit, they shall be made in series. 2) When a series of messages is being trans mitted, it shall be regarded as a single trans mission, except that the same separation shall be given to each message as is given to the transmission of a single message. Each mes sage correctly received shall be processed for delivery without waiting for the end of the series. 3) A series shall not contain more than ten messages. 3.12.3.—Remote Teletypewriter Selection When selective control of remote teletype writers on a common circuit is to be made, the procedure for accomplishing such selection shall be agreed by the telecommunication agencies concerned. 3.12.4.—Procedure for Communication Between Stations Permanently Connected to the Same Circuit 3.12.4.1. When teletypewriter communi cation is normally conducted between stations permanently on the same line or circuit, such stations shall have their teletypewriter operative during the specified hours for working. It shall not then be necessary to use a preliminary call prior to actual message transmission. 3.12.4.2. Transmitting schedules may be arranged by agreement between airline operating agencies when required to facilitate movement of communication traffic. If a transmitting schedule is not in effect, messages may be tran^ mitted at any time, provided they will not int^ fere with other communications in progress. 3.12.5.—Procedures for Stations not Permanently Connected The procedure for the handling of communica tions shall be the same for this class of station, except that provision must be made either to establish connection or to arrange for relay. 3.12.6.—Automatic Relay Procedure Automatic relay is accomplished by selective switching which causes automatic equipment to record and retransmit communications. The sequence of characters required to activate or de activate such equipment shall be decided by agreement between the telecommunication agen cies concerned. 3.12.7.—Switching Procedure 3.12.7.1. Automatic switching. —Automatic switching is accomplished in the same manner as automatic relay, but automatic equipment makes a direct connection to a desired circuit, and transmissions are received directly from the transmitting station. The sequence of characters required to activate or de-activate such equip ment shall be agreed between the telecommuni cation agencies concerned. 3.12.7.2. Manual switching. 3.12.7.2.1. Obtaining connection through switchboard(s): 1) To obtain connection through a single or series of switchboards, the transmitting opera tor will make request by transmitting the call sign of the stations to be connected. 2 ) If TRU is received in reply, the operator shall proceed with the transmission of the message. 3) If VERB is received, the operator shall repeat the request for the information of the further switchboard.COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 29 4 ) If NEH is received, the operator shall transmit the message to the switchboard sta tion for onward transmission. and will teletypewrite the call sign of those stations, followed by “ = TRU”: e.g., “GJFA GGDF GGBA = TRU”. i .12.7.2.2. Switchboard connecting procedure: 1 ) The switchboard operator shall answer calls by teletypewriting the call sign of the switchboard. 2) If connection is requested to a station directly connected to the switchboard, the connection is made, and TRU is teletype- written to the calling station. 5) The teletypewriter operator shall then proceed with the multiple transmission. 6 ) Each station shall acknowledge receipt in the order of its sequence in the call, and the circuits shall be disconnected in turn. 3.12.8.—Manual Transmission 3) If connection is requested to a station connected to another switchboard, the con nection is made to another switchboard, and VERB is teletypewritten to the calling sta tion. 3.12.8.1. Manual transmission shall be used only when equipment for automatic trans mission is not available, and/or when trans mitting acknowledgments, when correcting errors or when making other short transmissions. 4) If all lines to the required station or switchboard are engaged, and the calling sta tion is not the switchboard station, the con nection is made to the switchboard station, and NEH is teletypewritten to the calling station. 5) If all lines to the required station or sub sequent switchboards in series are engaged, and the calling station is the switchboard sta tion, BES is teletypewritten to the calling station by the switchboard which is unable to establish the connection. 3.12.7.2.3. Multiple {simultaneous) transmis sion procedure: 1) Multiple (simultaneous) transmission to a number of stations shall only be made by stations with switchboards and/or automatic transmission equipment. 2 ) Transmissions are to be made only to stations directly connected to the switchboard setting up the multiple transmission. 3) The transmitting operator shall request connection to a number of stations for a multi ple transmission by teletypewriting the letter M four times in a series, followed by the call signs of the stations required. 4) The switchboard operator shall then con nect the calling teletypewriter to as many of the required stations as are then disengaged, 3.12.8.2. Correction of errors: 1) After an error in transmission, the oper ator shall make the “error” sign (the letter E four times in a series), repeat the last word or group correctly transmitted, and then con tinue transmission. 2) When reception becomes unintelligible, the receiving operator shall interrupt the sender by transmitting the error sign, repeat the last word or group correctly received and follow with the sign of interrogation. The sender then resumes transmission with the last word or group correctly received. 3.12.9.—Automatic Transmission 3.12.9.1. Automatic transmission shall be conducted in the manner prescribed for manual transmission with the following exceptions or ad dition: 3.12.9.1.1. Preparation of tape. —Automatic transmitting tape shall be free from known errors. 3.12.9.1.2. Correction of errors. —Errors not ed by the transmitting station during transmis sion shall be corrected by placing a suitable nota tion immediately following the message. Such notations shall be transmitted manually and shall make use of the authorized ICAO abbrevia tions.30 COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 4.—Aeronautical Mobile Radio Service 4.1.—General 4.2.—Categories of Messages 4-1-1- Aeronautical telecommunication stations shall maintain continuous watch on the aircraft frequencies as necessary in connection with each flight. 4.1.2. _ During flight, aircraft shall main tain continuous watch on the ground to air route frequency, and shall transmit on the air to ground route frequency assigned by the air- ground control station. The aircraft station shall not abandon watch on the ground to air route frequency in use, without the concurrence of the air-ground control station. 4.1.3. ^ The air-ground control station shall assign the frequency(ies) to be used under normal conditions by stations operating in its control area. Under abnormal conditions, any aeronautical telecommunication station may assign the frequency to be used for air-ground communication with that station. Such assign ment shall be effective only during abnormal conditions and the control station shall be ad vised of the frequencies in use. 4. 1 .4. ^ Should contact with the telecom munication station fail on assigned frequencies, the aircraft shall try to establish contact on another frequency appropriate to the route. 4-1.5. An aircraft station shall nor mally communicate with the control station which exercises control in the area in which the aircraft is flying. An aircraft station may com municate with other aeronautical telecommuni cation stations on the same route when traffic can be handled better than through the control station. Messages of the aeronautical mobile radio service comprise: 1) Distress and urgency messages and urgency traffic. 2 ) Urgent NOTAMs (safety messages). 3) Air Traffic Control messages. 4) Aircraft movement messages. 5) Operational messages {see Paragraph 3.8.6). 6 ) Meteorological messages. 7) Service messages. 4.3.—Composition of Messages 4-3.1. When circumstances require a specific address to ensure delivery, messages should be composed in the same form as pre scribed in the fixed service. If, however, local conditions permit of messages being delivered direct by the receiving station without retrans mission on the fixed telecommunication service, the message number group, preamble and ad dress may be omitted. 4.3.2. Except where the text of mes sages is prescribed in relevant ICAO Procedures, the Q Code and other ICAO authorized abbre viations supplemented, if necessary, by plain language shall be used for drafting messages for transmission by the mobile service. In radio telephony, appropriate phrases shall be used. 4.1.6. ' In abnormal circumstances, an aircraft station may use any relay means avail able to transmit a message to a control station. A control station, also, may use any relay means available to transmit a message to an aircraft station. 4.4.—Priorities 4-4.1. The order of priority in the establishment of communications in the aero nautical mobile radio service shall be as follows:COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 31 1) Distress calls, distress messages and distress traffic. 2) Communications preceded by the urgen cy signal. 3) Communications preceded by the safety signal. 4) Messages bearing the priority prefix URGENT. 5) Air Traffic Control messages. 6 ) Aircraft movement messages. 7) Meteorological messages. 8 ) Operational messages. 9) Other messages. 4.4.2. Messages other than distress, urgency and safety may be preceded by the priority prefix URGENT when this is justified by their importance. 4.5.—Establishment of Communication 4.5.1. In general and except as other wise provided, the responsibility of establishing communication rests with the radio station having traffic to transmit. 4.5.2. When a communication sta tion is called simultaneously by several air craft stations, it shall decide the order in which aircraft shall communicate. 4.5.3. In communications between air craft stations, the duration of continuous work is controlled by the aircraft station which is re ceiving, subject to the intervention of a commu nication station. 4.5.4. When it is necessary to suspend work, e.g., on account of a thunderstorm or of repairs to apparatus, an aircraft shall, if possible, inform the control station beforehand by send ing the appropriate phrase or Q signal, followed by the time (GCT) at which it is expected that communication will be resumed. When trans mission is again possible, the aircraft shall call the control station and send the appropriate phrase or Q signal. 4.5.5. If working must be suspended beyond the time specified in the original notice, an appropriate phrase or Q signal with revised time of resumption of communication shall, if possible, be transmitted by the aircraft station, at or near the time first specified. 4.5.6. In establishing communication by means of radio-telegraphy the full call sign of the aircraft radio station shall be used. After communication has been established, an abridged call consisting of the first letter and the last two letters of the call sign may be used, provided that no confusion will result. 4.6.—Failure of Air-Ground Communication 4.6.1. If communication in the air- ground service cannot be established, efforts shall be made to relay traffic via any other aeronau tical station or aircraft station with which com munication is possible. If the relay station is unable to deliver traffic to the aircraft, it shall advise the originator of such inability. There after, the message may be broadcast on the normal frequency, if this is specifically author ized by the originator. 4.6.2. Should an aircraft station, for any reason other than failure of its transmitter, be unable to establish communication, it shall transmit periodical reports at scheduled times, or positions, on the assigned frequency. 4.6.3. The control station shall notify the Air Traffic Control Office and the airline operating agency, as quickly as possible, of any failure in air-ground communication. 4.7.—Radio-Telegraph Procedure Radio-telegraph communications in the aero nautical mobile radio service are effected in the same manner as for the fixed service. 4.8.—Radio-Telephone Procedure 4.8.1.—Language Used In general, radio-telephone communications between aircraft and aeronautical stations shall% 32 be conducted in the language of the ground sta tion. The English language shall also be used, on request from the aircraft station. In English speaking countries the first alternative language shall be French or Spanish, the selection to be made regionally. 4.8.2.—Calling 4.8.2. 1 . Where necessary for identifica tion, the word RADIO shall follow the name of the location of the telecommunication station, and either the word TOWER or the words APPROACH CONTROL shall follow the name of the aerodrome. Example: MIAMI RADIO. MIAMI TOWER. MIAMI APPROACH CONTROL. 4.8. 2 . 2 . Aircraft stations shall be identi fied by the telephony abbreviation of the airline COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services operating agency, followed by either the radio call sign of the aircraft, the flight identification, or the abbreviated registration of the aircraft. Example: CLIPPER KHDVE agency and call sign). (airline # operating CLIPPER FOUR SEVEN (airline opera ting agency and flight identification). CLIPPER ONE FIVE THREE (airline operating agency and abbreviated regis tration). 4. 8 .2.3. After communication has been established using the complete call sign or regis tration, an abridged call may be used consisting of the abbreviation of the airline operating agen cy and the last two characters of the call sign or registration. 4.8. 2 .4. The initial call procedure of a station attempting to establish communication with a specified aircraft shall be as follows: Item Radio-telephony Radio-telegraphy Designation of the station called SPEEDBIRD GABCD (or SPEEDBIRD one five) GABCD The words THIS IS THIS IS DE Designation of the station calling NEW YORK RADIO WSY Invitation to reply OVER K 4.8.2.5. The reply to an initial call shall be as follows: Item Radio-telephony Radio-telegraphy Designation of the station called NEW YORK RADIO WSY The words THIS IS THIS IS DE Designation of the answering station SPEEDBIRD GABCD (or SPEEDBIRD one five) GABCD Invitation to proceed with transmission OVER KCOM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 33 4 . 8 .2. 6 . Communications shall commence with a call and answer when it is desired to establish contact. If it is certain that the station called will receive the call, the calling station f^.y follow with the message, without waiting reply from the station called. 4 . 8 . 2 .7. Certain types of messages, such as position reports and Air Traffic Control in structions, shall be read back, when required by an authorized agency, to ensure accuracy of reception. 4 . 8 .2. 8 . After communication has been established, continuous two-way communication may be conducted without further identification or call (if no mistake in identity is likely to occur) until termination of the contact. 4.8.3.—Exchange of Communication by Radio-Telephony 4.8.3.1. Transmissions shall be concise and in a normal conversational tone. While it is not practicable to lay down precise phraseologies for all radio-telephone work, the terms appearing on Page 34 should be used where applicable. 4. 8 .3.2. When no confusion will occur, a shortened form of procedure may be used. Thus OVER and other similar phrases may be omitted at the discretion of the operators after initial contact has been established. 4.8.3.3. Acknowledgment of receipt. —An acknowledgment of receipt shall not be given until the receiving operator is certain that the transmitted information has been received cor rectly. A receiving station shall acknowledge receipt by transmitting its own identification followed by the word ROGER. For verification, the receiving operator may repeat back the message as an acknowledgment of receipt. 4.8.3.4. Termination of communication .— A radio-telephone contact shall be terminated by the receiving station using the phrase ROGER OUT (with a slight pause between the two words). 4.8.4.—Corrections 4.8.4.1. When an error has been made, the word CORRECTION shall be spoken, the last correct group or phrase repeated, and then the correct version transmitted. 4.8.4.2. If repetition of an entire message is required, the word REPEAT shall be spoken. If repetition of a portion of a message is required, the operator shall state: “REPEAT ALL BE FORE .... {first word satisfactorily received)'’, or “REPEAT .... {word before missing portion) TO .... {word after missing portion)'’, or “RE PEAT ALL AFTER .... {last word satisfactorily received)'. Specific items may be requested if more appropriate than the forms quoted. 4.8.5.—Repetitions Items shall not be repeated, unless repetition is requested by the receiving station. Repeti tions should be requested if reception is doubtful. 4.8.5.1. Transmission of numerals. —All numerals shall be spoken individually. The digit 0 shall be spoken ZERO. 4.8.6.—Net Operation Stations operating within a net may dispense with the use of the procedure phrases ROGER, OVER, OUT, etc., when no confusion will result. 4.8.7.—The Phonetic Alphabet 4.8.8. Proper names, service abbrevia tions and words of which the spelling is doubtful may be spelled out in telephony, using the fol lowing phonetic alphabet: A — ABLE N — NAN B — BAKER O — OBOE C — CHARLIE P — PETER D — DOG Q — QUEEN E — EASY R — ROGER F — FOX S — SUGAR G — GEORGE T — TARE H — HOW U — UNCLE I — ITEM V — VICTOR J — JIG W — WILLIAM K — KING X — XRAY L — LOVE Y — YOKE M — MIKE Z — ZEBRA 4.8.9.

In radio-telephony the dis tress signal consists of the spoken expression MAYDAY. 4.9.2.—Distress Call The distress call consists of the distress signal sent three times, followed by the word DE, and by the call sign of the aircraft station in distress, sent three times. This ^ call has absolu te priority over all other trans- 555 ’ missions. All stations which hear it must immediately cease any transmission capa ble of interfering with the distress calls or messages, and must listen on the frequency used for the emission of the distress call. 4.9.3.—Sending of Distress Message rr The distress call must be immediately 556 followed by the distress message. 4.9.4.—Distress Procedure When an aircraft is threatened by serious and imminent danger, and requires immediate assist ance, the person in command of the aircraft will direct appropriate action as follows: 1) Turn on automatic emergency equip ment if so provided. 2) When radio-tele grap hy is used, transmit the distress signal SOS (three times), the word DE, followed by the call sign of the air craft (three times), the distress message, a twenty-second dash, the call sign of the air craft once, and the signal K. 3) When VHP radio-telephony is used, trans mit the distress signal MAYDAY (three times), the words THIS IS, followed by the 4) When MF and HF radio-telephony is used, transmit the distress signal MAYDAY (three times), the words THIS IS, the identi fication of the aircraft (three times), the dis tress message followed by a twenty-second period during which the microphone button remains depressed, the identification of the aircraft once, and the word OVER. 5) When modulated telegraphy (MCW) is available on radio -telephone frequencies, the dis tress signal SOS may be transmitted prior to the procedures specified in 3) or 4), or any other available methods may be employed to call attention to the distress. 4.9.5.—Frequencies Used The first transmission by the aircraft shall be on the designated air-ground route frequency. If the aircraft is unable to establish communica tion on the designated air-ground route frequen cy, any other available frequency shall be used in an effort to establish contact with a ground or ship station. 4.9.6.—Contents of Distress Message If time permits, the following information shall be transmitted: 1 ) estimated position and time thereof; 2 ) true heading and indicated air speed; 3) altitude; 4) type of aircraft; 5) nature of distress; 6 ) intention of person in command (such as forced alighting on the sea or crash landing). 4.9.7.—-Position Reports 4.9.7.1. As a general rule, an aircraft over the sea shall signal its position in latitude and longitude (Greenwich), but may give the true bearing and distance in nautical miles (unless otherwise indicated in the message) from some known geographical point. When the posi tion is expressed in latitude and longitude, a group of four figures followed by the letter N or36 COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services S shall be used for latitude and a group of four figures followed by the letter E or W for longi tude. In radio-telephony the words North, South, East and West shall be used. 4.9.7.2. An aircraft flying over land shall signal its position by the name of, and approxi mate distance and direction from, the nearest reference point. The direction shall be indicated by the letters N, S, E, W, or the letters appro priate to the sixteen points of the compass. In radio-telephony, the words North, South, East, West, or words appropriate to the intermediate directions, should be used. 4.9.8.—Locking of Carrier Control Immediately prior to a forced or crash land ing, the telegraph key shall be closed. If the aircraft is equipped with radio-telephone, any means available shall be used to obtain continu ous transmission. 4.9.9.—Repetition of Distress Message The distress message shall be repeated at in tervals until an answer has been received. 4.9.10.—Alarm Signal When the international distress frequency of 500 kc/s. is used, the distress call should, when practicable, be immediately preceded by the automatic alarm signal of twelve four-second dashes, with intervals of one second between each. 4.9.11.—Transmission of Distress Message by Other Aircraft An aircraft becoming aware that another air craft is in distress may transmit the distress call or message when: 1 ) the aircraft in distress is not itself in a position to transmit it; or 2 ) the person in command of the aircraft which intervenes believes that further help is necessary. 4.9.12.—Action by Aeronautical Telecommunication Stations The station of the aeronautical service, which was last in contact with the distressed aircraft and which receives a distress message from siMfii aircraft, must acknowledge its receipt at once. Other stations of the aeronautical service, which receive a distress message from an aircraft, must wait a reasonable period before acknowledging its receipt, so that the station having primary responsibility may answer and acknowledge receipt without interference. 4.9.13.—Acknowledgment of Receipt Receipt of a distress message shall be ac knowledged in the following manner: 1) In radio-telegraphy: call sign of the aircraft in distress (three times), the word DE, call sign of the station acknowledging receipt (three times), the group RRR, the distress signal, and the signal AR. 2 ) In radio-telephony: identification of the aircraft in distress (three times), the words THIS IS, identification of the station acknowl edging receipt (three times), the word ROGER and the words MAYDAY OUT. 4.9.14.—Distress Traffic All further messages relating to the immediate assistance needed by the aircraft in distress shall be classified as “distress traffic’’. Every message relating to distress conditions must include the distress signal preceding the call and repeated at the beginning of the preamble. 4.9.15.—Distress Action A radio station receiving a distress message relating to an aircraft in distress shall forward the information immediately to the area traffic control centre or flight information centre. The radio station shall take further im mediate action as follows: 1 ) Continue to guard the aircraft frequency last used and, as far as possible, any other frequencies which may be used by that partic ular aircraft. Under no circumstances, shallCOM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 37 the frequency last used by the aircraft be left unguarded. A continuous watch shall be established immediately on the authorized international distress frequencies. ^ 2 ) Notify any D/F station with which the control station can communicate. 4.9.17.—Speed of Distress Signalling In handling distress traffic the speed of tele graphy should not normally exceed sixteen words per minute, unless positive accuracy can be maintained at higher speed. 3) Handle distress traffic to, or from, the station which transmitted the distress call, and control all such traffic when authority to do so has been delegated by that station or when it has reason to believe that the aircraft in distress is not in a position to make any delegation of responsibility. 4.9.16.—Cancellation of Distress Procedure If the aircraft is no longer in distress, it must transmit, on the same frequency, a message can celling the state of distress. When it is no longer necessary to observe silence, or when the distress traffic is ended, the station which has controlled the traffic shall send on the distress frequency, and on the frequency used for the distress traffic, a message addressed “to all stations” (CQ), indicating that the distress traffic is ended and shall so inform the area traffic control centre and the flight information centre. This message shall take the following form: 1) In radio-telegraphy: the distress signal, the call to all stations CQ (three times), the word DE, the call sign of the station transmitting the message (once), time of handing in (filing) of the message, name or call sign of the aircraft station which was in distress (once), and the abbreviation QUM. 2) In radio-telephony: the word MAYDAY, the words THIS IS, the identification of the station transmitting the message (once), name or identification of the aircraft station which was in distress, and the words DISTRESS TRAFFIC ENDED. 3) Should facilities for transmission on the international distress frequency not be avail able at the air-ground control radio station, the rescue service, or other agency having the frequency available, shall be requested to trans mit the message relative to cessation of dis tress traffic. 4.10.—Urgency Communications 4.10.1. In the general mobile service, the following urgency signals are used: 4.10.1.1. In radio-telegraphy, the ur gency signal consists of three repetitions of the group XXX, sent with the letters of each group, and the successive groups clear ly separated from each other; it is sent before a call. 4.10.1.2. In radio-telephony, the ur gency signal consists of three repetitions of the expression PAN; it is sent before a call. 4.10.2. The urgency signal indicates that the station calling has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the safety of a ship, aircraft or other vehicle, or of some person on board or within sight. 4.10.3. As a general rule, the urgency signal shall be used only if the aircraft station addresses it to a specific station. 4 . 10 . 4 . The signal must, if possible, be followed by a message giving further informa tion. 4.10.5. The urgency signal has prior ity over all other communications, except distress, and all stations which hear it must take care not to interfere with the trans mission of messages which follow the ur gency signal. 4.10.6. Stations which hear the ur gency signal must continue to listen for at least three minutes. At the end of this period, if no urgency message has been heard, they may resume normal service. 4.10.7. Urgency messages transmitted in the aeronautical fixed service shall bear the priority prefix SVH.38 COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services Example of Distress Traffic Telegraphy Telephony Aircraft Aircraft SOS (3 times) DE GABCD (3 times) QTH 15 KM SE BEXHILL QTI 270 QTJ 200 KTS ENGINE FAILURE QUG {20-second dash) K.

In the general mobile service, the following safety signals are used: f^l 1.1.1. In radio-telegraphy, the safe ty signal consists of three repetitions of the group TTT, sent with the letters of each 615 group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. 4.11.1.1.1. This signal is followed by the general call CQ and/or a specific call sign or signs, the word DE, and the call sign of the transmitting station, sent three times. It indi cates that the station is about to transmit a message concerning the safety of navigation or giving important meteorological warnings. 4.11.1.2. In radio-telephony, the word SECURITY, repeated three times, is used as the safety signal. 4.11.2. The safety signal shall precede urgent NOTAMs which affect aircraft in flight. 5.—Aeronautical Navigational Radio Service 5.1.—General The aeronautical navigational radio service comprises all the types of radio beacons and other systems of radio navigational aids used in the international aeronautical service. 5.2.—Direction Finding* 5.2.1. Direction-finding stations work either singly or in groups of two or more stations under the direction of a main direction-finding station. 5.2.2. A direction-finding station work ing alone can only determine the direction of an aircraft in relation to itself. It may give the following: 1) True hearing of the aircraft, as requested, using the abbreviation QTE or appropriate phrase; 2 ) True course to be steered by the aircraft, with no wind, to head for the direction-finding station, as requested, using the abbreviation QUJ or appropriate phrase; 3) Magnetic hearing of the aircraft, as re quested, using the abbreviation QDR or ap propriate phrase; 4) Magnetic course to be steered by the air craft with no wind to make for the station, as requested, using the abbreviation QDM or appropriate phrase. 5.2.3. Direction-finding stations work ing as a group or network may determine the position of an aircraft. 5.2.3.1. The bearings taken by each sta tion are sent immediately to the station control ling the D/F network to enable the position of the aircraft to be determined. 5.2.3.2. The station controlling the net' work may give the aircraft its position in one of the following ways: 1) Position in relation to a point of reference or in latitude and longitude, as requested, using the abbreviation QTF or appropriate phrase; 2) True hearing of the aircraft in relation to the direction-finding station or other speci fied point using the abbreviation QTE or appropriate phrase, and its distance from the direction-finding station or point, as requested, using the abbreviation QGE or appropriate phrase; 3) Magnetic course to steer with no wind, to make for the direction-finding station or * In this section the term “appropriate phrase” denotes the meaning of the Q signal in question as given in Doc 2560-COM/164.■ 40 other specified point using the abbreviation QDM or appropriate phrase, and its distance from the direction-finding station or point, as requested, using the abbreviation QGE or appropriate phrase. 5.2.4. Aircraft shall normally make request for bearings, courses or positions, to the communication station responsible, or to the station controlling the D/F network. 5.2.5. To request a bearing, course or position, the aircraft station shall call the air- ground control station or the direction-finding control station on the listening frequency. The aircraft shall then specify the type of service that is desired by the use of the appropriate phrase or Q signal. 5.2.6. As soon as the D/F station or group of stations is ready, the station originally called by the aircraft shall request transmission for D/F service or send the appropriate Q signal, and, if necessary, indicate the frequency to be used by the aircraft or the number of times transmission should be repeated. 5.2.7. After having, if necessary, chang ed to its new transmitting frequency, the air craft station replies by sending its identification, a twenty-second dash and then repeating its identification. 5.2.8. In telephony, an aircraft, after reply from the ground station, shall give its identification and press the microphone button for about twenty seconds. m COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 5.2.11. If a position has been requested, the D/F control station, after plotting all simul taneous observations, shall determine the ob served position of the aircraft and shall advise the aircraft in the following form: ^ 1) the appropriate phrase or Q signal; 2 ) the position; 3) class of position; 4) time of observation. 5.2.12. As soon as the aircraft station has received the bearing, course or position, it shall repeat back the message for confirmation, or correction. 5.2.13. When positions are given by bearing or course and distance from a known point other than the station making the report, the reference point shall be an aerodrome, pro minent town or geographic feature. An aero drome shall be given in preference to other places. When a large city or town is used as a reference place, the bearing or course, and the distance given shall be measured from its centre. 5.2.14. When the position is expressed in latitude and longitude, a group of four figures followed by the letter N or S shall be used for latitude, and a group of four figures followed by the letter E or W for longitude. In radio telephony, the words North, South, East, or West, shall be used. 5.2.15. _ According to the judgment of the direction-finding station, bearings and posi tions shall be classified as follows: Bearings Class -d-—Accurate within 2 degrees. B -—Accurate within 5 degrees. C .—W here the error may be greater than 5 degrees. Positions Class A- Accurate within 5 miles (8 kilometres). B. Accurate within 20 miles (32 kilometres). C. Accurate within 50 miles (80 kilometres).COM Procedures for Air Navigation Services 41 5.2.15.1. The class of bearing or position will be added to the observation in reply to a request for a bearing or for a position. ■^G.lb. D/F stations may refuse to give bevlnngs, courses or positions when conditions are unsatisfactory or when bearings do not fall within the prescribed limits, stating the reason at the time of refusal. 5.2.17. An aircraft requiring a series of QDM shall call the D/F station concerned, on the appropriate frequency, and request the ser vice or send the signal QDL. When the series has commenced, the call signs of the stations may be omitted if no confusion is likely to arise. 5.2.18. Certain MF and HF direction finding stations are maintained for emergency and distress use only. The use of these stations, the call, location and frequencies of communica tion stations, and certain exceptions to the above procedure are shown in the appropriate section of the Route Guide. 5.3.—Operation of Radio Navigational Aids 5.3.1. An aeronautical radio naviga tional aid, which is not in continuous operation, shall be put into operation on receipt of a request from an aircraft. 5.3.1.1.

Pri( 2 S H Printed in Montreal, Canada by Inland Press Ltd.Extract from PROVISIONAL INTERNATIOML CIVIL AVIATION ORGANISATION (Committee Room No. 1,2:30 p.m., Friday, September 13, 1946) Italy to attend the Middle East Regional Air Navigation Meeting as an observer. He took the position that, since Italy had been invited to the European-^ editerranean Meeting, had shown an interest in the Middle East Meeting, and was a prospective operator in the region, the Italian Government should be invited to attend the Cairo meeting as an observer. 19» Dr. Copes van Hasselt said that he had no instructions from his Government on this point but that his own personal view was that there would be no objection to such an invitation, par ticularly in the light of the action taken by the Assembly. 20. Mr. Bouche felt that tie Council’s invitation to Italy to attend the raris meeting could not'be taken as a precedent for Cairo. Italy had been invited to raris as a State possessing a reasonable degree of sovereignty over territory in the European- Mediterranean region. She has no sovereignty over her former possessions in Africa nor will it be known whether she can be an operator of international air services until the peace treaty has been signed. He personally would not be prepared to vote on the matter at the present meeting and would ask that Council action be deferred. 21. The Council agreed to discuss the question further at its next meeting.

An official of Iraqi Airways has shown to a member of my staff a copy of the proceedings of the Civil Aviation Sub committee of the Communications Committee of the Arab League Which met in Cairo early in June. The Sub-Committee had before it proposals from Iraq, Syria and Egypt. 2. All three proposed that a unified policy towards civil aviation should be adopted by member States of the Arab League. Syrians also proposed the formation of an Arab Air Transport company. 3. Egypt and Iraq proposed the mutual grant by all Arab States of all five Freedoms. Iraq proposed that the 'middle East area (including Palestine but excluding Persia and Turkey) should be considered as a cabotage area in which air traffic rights should be reserved to regional airlines, and that a unified policy should be adopted towards non-Arab States. 4. The Sub-Committee found (a) That the Arab Air Company proposed by Syria was not recommended; (b)- 2 - (b) That a unified policy towards civil aviation inside the region was desirable; (c) That all Arab territories, including Palestine, should be regarded as a cabotage area as proposed by Iraq; (d) That a common policy should be adopted towards the grant of Fifth Freedom rights to non-Arab States; (e) That a clear plan should be formulated for the building up of a network of air communications within the region; (f) That with the above ends in view there should be a conference of the Directors of Civil Aviation of member States of the League, accompanied by representatives of their respective air operators as technical advisers, at Aley in the Lebanon on 8th July, 5. These findings were approved by the Communications Committee of the Arab League. 6. At the Aley conference Iraq will probably propose that if Fifth Freedom rights within the Middle East region are granted to outside operators they should be accompanied by the proviso that such rights will be withdrawn if and when a regional air line becomes capable of carrying the traffic; and that with this exception Fifth Freedom rights within the region should not be given to outside operators unless all member States agree that this would be in the interests of the region as a whole. 7. xhe Civil Aviation Sub-Committee included two Egyptians who did not mention the Egypto**American agreement of which I have read in the press, which appears to conflict with the findings of the-Sub-Committee and which was at the time in course of completion.a U A R D retain^ fiv +hA ux particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] [EM CLAIR] SPECIAL (CIVIL AVIATTON) FROK BA&amp;DAS TO FOREIGN OFFTOF, Sir H.

Miss Rclfe, Information Department CS. \6 H - — v-C^ . r.y^eel You maY like to have the following appreciation f the effect of the Chicago Agreement on Afghanistan, he agreements open for signature at Chicago were as follows (a) The Final Act. This is merely a record of the proceedings. (b) The Interim Agreement. This provides for the setting up of an Interim Council with the duty of watching the operation of (c), (c£) and (e) below and considering a more permanent International Agreement governing air transport. (c) 'The Convention. This deals with air navigation generally, i.e. air worthiness, licensing of personnel, etc, and is largely technical. (d) The Two Freedoms Agreement. These are:- (i) Freedom to fly over one’s territory without landing. (ii) Freedom to land for fuelling and repair purposes. This agreement operates only in regard to those countries which have signed it. Practically all countries have or will sign it. (e) The Five Freedoms Agreement. These besides theTwo Freedoms under (d) are:- (iii) The right to set down traffic embarked in the territory of the country to which the aircraft belongs. (iv) The ci^ht to pick up traffic bound for the ti-aTfSfr of the countiy to which the aircraft belongs. (v) The right to pick up and set dov.n traffic between two different territories neither of which belongs to the country to which the aircraft belongs, (it will be noted that this excludes cabotage traffic, i.e. that between two points in the same territory) The only countries which have signed the Five Freedoms Agreement are the IT.S.A , some Latin American countries, Sweden, Turkey (with a reservation excluding the fifth freedom) , Liberia, the Lebanon, China and Afghanistan. On the part of Afghanistan this was a piece of obvious sucking up to the U.S.A. The effect of it is that the Americans could run a service from the U.S.A to Kabul, using their Two Freedom position to obtain landing rights in intermediate territories and set down and pick up at Kabul traffic between the U.S.A. and India. This traffic ».ould. have to travel by other means between Kabul and India This ,.ould not be very attractive for the passengers involved and,unless the Americans secured additional rights from intermediate countries, would be very uneconomical. I donot therefore think that we need feel concerned at this development standing by itself. Neither the U. 3.S.R. nor Saudi rabia participated in the Chicago Conference and neither have signed any of the Agreements. The Two Freedoms Agreement was signed by the United Kingdom, India, Persia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Egypt and many others. Syria and China do not seem to have signed yet but presumably will.I CONTENTS Final Act Appendix I.—Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation ...

CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION Convention on International Civil Aviation, which is attached hereto as Appendix II. INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES TRANSIT AGREEMENT International Air Services Transit Agreement, which is attached hereto a» Appendix III. INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT AGREEMENT International Air Transport Agreement, which is attached hereto as Appendix IV. The following resolutions and recommendations were adopted: I PREPARATION OF THE FINAL ACT The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the Secretariat be authorized to prepare the Final Act in accordance with the suggestions proposed by the Secretary-General in Journal No. 34, December 4, 1944, and that the Co-ordinating Committee review the text; That the Final Act contain the definitive texts of the instruments formulated by the Conference in plenary session, and that no changes be made therein at the Final Plenary Session. II DRAFT TECHNICAL ANNEXES Whereas : The largest possible degree of international standardization of practice in many matters is important to safe, expeditious, and easy air navigation; and Whereas : These matters typically involve problems of great variety and complexity, and require that much new ground be explored; and Whereas : Considerable progress has been made, during the discussions of the present Conference, in the development of codes of practice agreed upon as proper by the technicians participating in the discussions, but the time has been too limited, and the number of personnel able to participate directly too small, to permit carrying the discussions to final conviction of the adequacy or correctness of certain of the determinations here made;13 ( 1 ) See note on page 1 . t The Litemational Civil Aviation Conference 'esolves : That the drafts of annexes for an international civil aviation convention, which are attached hereto as Appendix V^ 1 ) be accepted by the Conference, upon the bases that: {a) The drafts as now presented shall be accepted by the participating States for immediate and continuing study; (6) They shall be accepted as constituting models of the desirable scope and arrangement of the several annexes; ( c ) participating States undertake to forward to the Government of the United States (or to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization if it shall in the meantime have been established), by Ma y }&gt; I 945 » any recommendations which they may have for necessary additions, deletions, or amendments; (*?) Government of the United States (or the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization) will transmit such suggestions to the other participating States in anticipation of meetings of the technical committees to be established by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organiza tion for dealing with the subject matter of the various documents, such meetings to be held as soon as practicable thereafter for the purpose of ultimate acceptance of the annexes in final form for attachment to a convention. (e) Meanwhile, in so far as the Technical Subcommittees have been able to agree on recommended practices, the States of the world, bearing in nrl n rt,v! heir P 1656 ? 1 m J rn ahonal obligations, are urged to accept these practices as ones toward which the national practices of the several States ould be directed as far and'as rapidly as may prove practicable. Ill Whereas : TECHNICAL PERSONNEL The development and maintenance of suitable international standards in matters relating to international air navigation will require constant analysis, by technically qualified personnel, of the development of the pertinent arts and ot the various practices existing with respect thereto; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, as soon as possible after its organization, should employ in its Secretariat a suitable body of personnel, expert in the fields of aeronautical science and practice in which continuing study will be particularly needed; and that such technically qualified members of the Secretariat should be charged to analyze and report to the I rovisional International Civil Aviation Organization on problems relating to the drafting of international standards and recommended practices ai j &lt; : onduct an&lt; ^ re port on such other studies as will promote the safe and efficient conduct of international air transportation. IV METRIC SYSTEM Whereas : A_ standard system of measurements in all rules and regulations pertaining to air traffic on international and intercontinental airways would greatly con tribute to the safety of these operations; and•“ 1 - rv-r', •'-T—~ ■ mm m wtmtmmmtB i4 Whereas : It is considered of high importance that figures used in rules and regulations and other data, with which air crews and other operational personnel have to deal in the preparation of and during flights over various countries, should consist of round figures which can easily be remembered; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : 1. That in those cases in which it appears impracticable or undesirable to make use of the metric system as a primary international standard, units in publications and codes of practice directly_ affecting international air navi gation should be expressed both in the metric and English systems; and 2. That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization shall make further unification of numbering and systems of dimensioning and specification of dimensions used in connection with international air navigation the subject of continuing study and recommendation. V TRANSFER OF TITLE TO AIRCRAFT Considering : That the sale of aircraft to be used in international operations will render it desirable for the various governments to reach a common understanding on the legal questions involved in the transfer of title: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the early calling of an international confer ence on private international air law for the purpose of adopting a convention dealing with the transfer of title to aircraft and that such private air law conference include in the bases of discussions: (a) The existing draft convention relating to mortgages, other real securi ties, and aerial privileges; and (b) The existing draft convention on the ownership of aircraft and the aeronautic register, both of which were adopted by the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA) in 1931. VI ROME CONVENTION (MAY 29, 1933) f 2 ) RELATING TO THE PRECAUTIONARY ATTACHMENT OF AIRCRAFT Considering : That the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce is essential in order that the fullest advantage may be derived from the rapid means of communication afforded by aircraft; That the seizure or detention of aircraft where the attaching creditor cannot invoke a judgment and execution obtained beforehand in the ordinary course of procedure, or an equivalent right of execution, affects the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce; The International Civil Aviation Conference ( 2 ) 'League of Nations Treaty Series ” No. 447y(not ratified by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom).15 Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of ratifying or adhering to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Precautionary Attachment of Aircraft, signed at Rome on May 29, 1933, during the Third International Conference on Private Air Law, in so far as such governments have not already ratified or adhered to that Convention. RESUMPTION OF AND Considering : VII CO-ORDINATION CITEJA WITH THE SESSIONS OF That the Comit6 International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA), created pursuant to a recommendation adopted at the First Inter national Conference on Private Air Law held at Paris in 1925, has made considerable progress in the development of a code of private international air law through the preparation of draft international conventions for final adoption at periodic international conferences on private air law; That the further elaboration of this code of private international air law ' through the completion of pending CITEJA projects and the initiation or new studies in the field of private air law will contribute materially to the development of international civil aviation: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of bringing about the resumption at the earliest possible date of the CITEJA sessions which were suspended because of the outbreak of war, of making necessary con tributions toward the expenses of the Secretariat of CITEJA, and of appoint ing legal experts to attend the CITEJA meetings; and 2 . ' consideration also be given by the various governments to the desirability of co-ordinating the activities of CITEJA with those of the Pro visional International Civil Aviation Organzation and, after it shall have come into existence, of the permanent International Civil Aviation Organiza tion established pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7th, 1944. VIII STANDARD FORM OF AGREEMENT FOR PROVISIONAL AIR ROUTES Whereas : The course of military events will free certain areas of the world from the interruption which the war has caused to civil air traffic; Whereas : The civil transport systems and facilities of many States have been reduced to a level which is far from adequate, but on the other hand there exist wide opportunities for utilizing the airplane, which has demonstrated its efficiency in rendering rapid transportation on a large scale basis, in bringing aid to needy countries and in hastening the return of normal trade and commerce; 4 I2 35 A 5i 6 Whereas : fl The possibilities of air transportation are so great and at the same time so unpredictable, that it is desirable to promote early development in this field during a transitional period, in order to obtain practical experience for giving effect to more permanent arrangements at a later date; Whereas : Every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory; and Whereas : It is desirable that there should be as great a measure of uniformity as possible in any agreements that may be made between States for the operation of air services; The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That each State undertake to refrain from including specific provisions in an agreement which grant exclusive rights of transit, non-traffic stop, and commercial entry to any other State or airline, or from making any agreement excluding or discriminating against the airlines of any State, and will terminate any existing exclusive or discriminatory rights as soon as such action can be taken under presently outstanding agreements; 2. That the clauses contained in the draft form of standard agreement hereinafter set out shall be regarded as standard clauses for incorporation in the agreements referred to above, it being understood that the right is reserved to the States concerned to effect such changes of wording as may be necessary in the particular case and to add additional clauses so long as such changes or additions are not inconsistent with the standard clauses, it being further understood that nothing herein shall prevent any State from entering into agreements with airlines of other States provided that such agreements shall incorporate the aforementioned standard clauses to the extent that these may be applicable: Form of Standard Agreement for Provisional Air Routes (1) The contracting parties grant the rights specified in the Annex* hereto necessary for establishing the international civil air routes and services therein described, whether such services be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted. (2) (a) Each of the air services so described shall be placed in operation as soon as the contracting party to whom the right has been granted by paragraph (1) to designate an airline or airlines for the route concerned has authorized an airline for such route, and the contracting party granting the right shall, subject to Article (7) hereof, be bound to' give the appropriate operating permission to the airline or airlines concerned; provided that the airline so designated may be required to qualify before the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party granting the rights under the laws and regulations normally applied by these authorities before being per mitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this Agreement; and * An Annex will include a description of the routes and of the rights granted whether of transit only, of non-traffic stops or of commercial entry as the case may be, and the conditions incidental to the granting of the rights. Where rights of non-trafflc stops or commercial rights are granted, the Annex will include a designation of the ports of call at which stops can be made, or at which commercial rights for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, cargo and mail are authorized, and a statement of the contracting parties to whom the respective rights are granted.17 ^provided that in areas of hostilities or of military occupation, or in areas ^.ffected thereby, such inauguration shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities. (b) It is understood that any contracting party granted commercial rights under this Agreement should exercise them at the earliest practicable date except in the case of temporary inability to do so. ( 3 ) Operating rights which may have been granted previously by any of the contracting parties to any State not a party to this Agreement or to an airline shall continue in force according to their terms. (4) In order to prevent discriminatory practices and to assure equality of treatment, it is agreed that: {a) Each of the contracting parties may impose or permit to be imposed just and reasonable charges for the use of airports, and other facilities. Each of the contracting parties agrees, however, that these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services. (b) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into the territory of a contracting party by another contracting party or its nationals, and intended solely for use by aircraft of such other contracting party shall be accorded national and most-favoured-nation treatment with respect to the im position of customs duties, inspection fees or other national duties or charges by the contracting party whose territory is entered. (c) The .fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and air craft stores retained on board civil aircraft of the airlines of the contracting parties authorized to operate the routes and services described in the Annex shall, upon arriving in or leaving the territory of other contracting parties, be exempt from customs, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used or consumed by such aircraft on flights in that territory. (5) Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting parties for the purpose of operating the routes and services described in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight above its own terri tory , certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. (6) (a) The laws and regulations of a contracting party relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation, or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall be applied to the aircraft of all contracting parties without distinction as to nationality, and shall be complied with by such aircraft upon entering or departing from or while within the territory of that party. (b) The laws and regulations of a contracting party as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew, or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew, or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within, the territory of that party. (7) Each contracting party reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certifi cate or permit to an airline of another State in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a party to this Agreement, or in case of failure of an airline to comply with the laws of the State over which it operates, as described in Article (6) hereof, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 41235 A 6■'SC 18 f (8) This Agreement and all contracts connected therewith, shall be regil tered with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization. (9) [Where desired, here insert provisions for arbitration, the details of which will be a matter for negotiation between the parties to each agreement.] (10) This Agreement shall continue in force until such time as it may be amended, or superseded by a general multilateral air convention, provided, however, that the rights for services granted under this Agreement may be terminated by giving one year’s notice to the contracting party whose air lines are concerned. Such notice may be given at any time after a period of two months to allow for consultation between the contracting party giving notice and the contracting parties served by the routes. IX FLIGHT DOCUMENTS AND FORMS The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, when estab lished, be requested to give consideration to the question of the publication of flight documents and forms in representative languages of areas through which major international air routes are operated.

Senior Afghan officials favour the development of air services in and through Afghanistan and welcomed the inauguration of the German service between Berlin and Kabul via Tehran prior to the ou'c-break of the world war. The Prime minister has however always been opposed to any extention of air services between Afghanistan and Russia because the grant of such i acilities might mean the establishment of Russian ground staffs and communist propaganda calls at Kabul and „iazar-i- Sharif or Khanabad and he prefers to keep the Russians in the air with their present very limited diplomatic mail service. Suggestions that an air service should be established between India and Kabul have usually been resisted in the past on the ground that the Russian Government might demand similar facilities, Present indications are that the Afghan Govt, are anxious to place Afghanistan on the air services map, but that they will move very cautiously in the matter and attempt to develop an air service west to east or east to west rather than north to south with any service inaugurated partially under Afghan control and sponsored by a foreign country not contiguous to Afghanistan.Il'ITSMm'ION' lL GOMvIISSION FOR /JR Ii,VIGJriOI'T 60 bis Avenue d*Iena, Paris.

I prepared the attached letter in Paris on the subject, and shall be much obliged if you will be good enough to communicate its contents to any of your country’s representatives who may be passing through London in connexion with the above- mentioned Conferences. With very many thanks, I remain, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (SGD.) ALBERT ROPER Secretary General to the International Commission for Air Navigation.

The international conventions governing postal relations, radiocanmunications, railway transport, sanitary questions, etc#.# v/ill undoubtedly after the War need sane amendment, but there is no question of repealing them in order to replace than by other arrangements improvised hastily: the Convention relating to the regulation of aerial navigation, signed at Paris on 13th October, 1919&gt; the application of which was not suspended by hostilities, is in force for thirty-three States and, if certain amendments to its text are desirable, it may, without immediate modifica.tion, allow the full development of future air navigation (See Annex 2 hereafter) • If however, any modifications to the technical Annexes of tho Convention (Air Traffic, R adi o c amiunic at ions, Meteorology) .gfoould appear to be urgent, it would be possible to convene, .almost immediately, in London for instance, the Operational, -Wireless and Meteorological Sub-Cannissions in order to prepare draft amendments to be submitted, within a short delay, to a session of the Cadmission, rapidly convened for this purpose# 2# After the War modifications nay be made in the work of certain international organizations, but it is probable that the most important will have to pursue or resume their activities (Universal Postal Union, International Union of Telecanmuncation, International Union of Railways, International Office of Public Hygiene*, etc#): the International Canmission for Air Navigation Thfc Under Secretary of State India Office LONDON S.W.l#will be among the latter since it must, in order to take into account the considerable technical progress realised during hostilities, pursue vvlthout delay the bringing up to date of the indispensable regulations which it alone had power to enact. It is ready, with its tried methods, its twenty years of experience and the material means provided by its well organized Secretariat (see Annex 1 hereafter), to fulfil its attributions more fully than in the past. 3* An attempt to substitute new agreements for the Convention of 1919 and to replace the C.I.N.A. by another international organisation would lead to. disorder, from which only the United States of America could perhaps profit by talcing up a position oi advantage before other Nations at that moment deprived of any civil air fleet could substantiate their claims. 4* As the International /dr Convention of 1919 has the advantage of being in force for thirty-three States and as the International Commission for /dr Navigation has proved its usefulness and its efficiently, for eighteen years, it may be deemed that the Contracting States would be opposed to any fundamental change which might be considered and individually would endeavour to caus^ the States not yet parties to the Convention to ratify or to adhere to it as soon as possible, in order that in future air navigation may be under only one regulation, I venture to hope that the Government of India which, in 1919, took part in the preparation of the Convention and, since 1922, in the organization and development of the International Commission for Air Navigation, will consider, as the Governments of the Contracting States which encouraged and supx 3 ort.ed me during the past four years have done, that the C.I.N.A. must resume all its activities at the cessation of hostilities, I have the honour to be, Sir, Yours respectfully, Sgd.

The International Commission for Air Navigation (C.I,N.A.) y/as instituted by the Convention relating to the regulation of aerial navigation, signed at Paris on 13th October, 1919, entered into application on 11th July, 1922, and enforced by the follov/ing thirty-three States: /argentine Australia Belgium Bulgaria Canada Denmark Spain Estonia Finland France Great Britain Greece India Iraq Ireland Italy Japan Latvia Norway New Zealand Paraguay Netherlands Peru Poland Portugal Rouznania Sweden Switzerland Czechoslovakia Thailand Union of South Africa Uruguay Yugoslavia it is to say by all the countries which have a practical interest in the development of air navigation, except the following: United States of America (signatory) Germany (non-signatory) Brazil ( H J Hungary ( M M ) china ( ” j U.S.S.R.( ” ' ) The C.I*N«A*, the importance of which never ceased to increase since 1922, was in full activity in 1939i its Secretariat comprised a staff of twenty-eight Members and its annual budget attained two and a half millions of French francs (1)* The War, occurring some weeks after the twenty-seventh plenary Session, held at Copenhagen in June, 1939, had as a consequence to postpone all the meetings of Sub-Commissions and Committees arranged for the end of 1939: a Conference of (1) See in Annex 1 hereafter a Note on the character and the activity of the C.I.N,A.- 2 - Radiotelegraph and Meteorological Experts charged to sot up H Instructions concerning the International Teleconnnunication Service of Air Navigation”, adopted in June, 1939, t&gt;y the Commission, met, hov/ever, in Paris in February, 19^0. The Secretariat of the Commission v/orked normally till June, 1940, but, some days after the entry of the Cerman troops in Paris, an officer came and notified to the Secretary General an order to close the seat of the Commission, ■which order had been given by the German Air Ministry, and he affixed on the entrance door of the office rooms a placard prohibiting the entrance therein to anybody: the premises, however, were not placed under seals and the Usher and Janitress, maintained on the spot, were allowed to assume the custody and upkeep thereof. On 27th July, 1940, Mr. SCHNITZLER, an assistant to Ministerialdirektor FISCH, the Director of Civil Aviation at the German Air Ministry, came from Berlin and stated to the Secretary General that his chief, being not aware of the fact whether the seat of the C.I.N.A. were kept or abandoned, and whether the Secretary General were present or absent, had deemed fit to ask from Berlin the German military Authorities in Paris for closing the Secretariat in order to avoid the occupation of the office rooms by their own troops, and to secure the preservation of the precious archives of the Commission. The Secretary General of the C.I.N.A. expressed his intention to reopen at the earliest the Secretariat and asked energetically for the setting at his disposal of the seat of the Commission. Mr. FISCH received favourably that request and undertook a short time after to remove the prohibition that he had provoked, but the steps were rather long as the premises were first made free on 26 th February, 1941. The Secretariat took up again its work on 1st March, 1941, with the only obligation to submit to the German censorship the publications which it intended to distribute: such censorship approved without difficulty the regular issue of the French edition of the BULLETIN OF UTORMATION, as well as the printing of the INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE OF AIR NAVIGATION (l.S.I.T.N.A.) in French, but they refused to allow the printing of OFFICIAL BU TJE TIN No.27, dated, however, December, 1939&gt; and of the edition of the CONVENTION put up to date on 1st January, 1940, under the pretext that these documents were partly drawn up in English. Beyond that vexation, the German Authorities never intervened in the functioning of the Secretariat which was submitted to no control and the Secretary General even obtained later on, when the sending of French workers to Germany was organized, an exemption for the Secretariat from any personal contribution, and even from any declaration. The/The -work in which the Secretariat engaged since 1st Ijarch, wns ns -Pol Hctvtr ? : 4t 19 M &gt; was as follows: - Rcassuming of the regular, but only monthly, publication) of the BULLETIN OP INFORMATION; - Translation into French of the documents, laws and regulations which wore pending in 1 %.0, or v4iich wore sent thenceforth by a certain number of Contracting States with a view to their publication in the BULLETIN OF INFORMATION; - Completion of the v/orking off of the last final Minutes of the Con Assion, Sub-Conrdssions and Committees; - Setting up of the Agenda of the 28th Session and of the future mootings of Sub-Commissions and Committees; preparation of all the documentation necessary for the reassuming of their work; - Reconstitution of the documents in stock at the Secretariat with a view to provide the Delegates and Experts, as well as their Administrations, with the desirable documentation on the pasi activity of the Commission; - Sending of documentation to numerous Administrations, the archives of which had suffered from the War, or which had undertaken to prepare the discussions to be resumed just after the restoration of Peace; - Preparation for certain Delegations of Statements, among which the following two Notes: - The international collaboration with a view to the organization of air navigation, ( 1 ) - Can the International Convention of 13th October, 1919 permit the full development of to-morrow’s air navigation? ( 2 ) which were of a general interest, were sent to the other Delegations with which the Secretariat was able to correspond. To carry out this amount of work, a limited stafT was sufficientj out of the twenty-eight Members of the staff of the Secretariat in 1939, end out of the sixteen who still subsisted in June, 1940, only nine were maintained in their functions since March, 19VU (1) This Note will be shortly translated into English and distributed, (2) Reproduced in Annex 2 hereafter.■■■■■■■■■■■■ -4- In order to diminish the expenses, the working time wns brought back to twenty hours a v/eck and all remunerations of the staff were reduced by 50 per cent; however, in order to take into account, in a small measure, the considerable elevation of the cost of living in Paris, without proceeding to any increase of remunerations, the duration of work was brought up, in July, 1943# to twenty-four hours a week, and the remuneration rate was raised to 60 per cent of its amount in 1940 . Thanks to these measures and to other restrictions, the functioning expenses of the Secretariat have been brought back from 2,107,493 French francs in 1938 to 670,691 French francs in 1943, the financial situation of the Secretariat v/as always sound in spite of the sensible decreasing of the resources owing to the fact that numerous States were prevented from paying the amount of their contribution. The Secretary General ms, in fact, deprived, since June 1940, of all relations with the following eighteen States: Argentine Australia Canada Estonia Great Britain Greece India Iraq Latvia New Zealand Paraguay Peru Poland Czechoslovakia Thailand Union of South Africa Uruguay Yugoslavia He could only correspond, either by post, or by the interposition of their diplomatic Representatives in Paris or in Vichy, with the Governments of the following fifteen States: Belgium France Netherlands Bulgaria Ireland Portugal Denmark Italy Roumania Spain Japan Sweden Finland Norway Switzerland With the exceptions of Bulgaria, Ireland and t help and the financial support he v/anted, The payment of the contributions of these twelve States for the years 1941, 1942 and 1943 enabled the Secretary to maintain the Secretariat in activity, and oven to propose to the acting Chairman to reduce, on two successive occasions, the rate of contributions fixed by the Commission for 1940. The scale of payments during the recent years varied, therefore, as follows:-5- 1940 and 1941 194.2 1943 and 1944 (in French francs) States of class 5 ' »' » 4 *» it 11 ^ H H II 2 II II II 150.000 120.000 90.000 60.000 30.000 120.000 100.000 96.000 80.000 72.000 60.000 48.000 40.000 24.000 20.000 Despite these reductions, the credit account is important enough to permit of considering nov/ that the Secretaxiat of the Commission has favourably past the most difficult period of the conflict. Owing to the lack of land, as well as of sea, means of communication, wherefrom all eaonomies will suffer after the cessation of hostilities, the carriage by air will necessarily take a considerable and immediate development. In numerous places, the international regulations of air navigation in force just before the War v/ill prove inadequate: it will be then the task of the International Commission for Air Navigation, which prepared these regulations, to adapt them very quickly to the realized progress and to the new requirements of air traffic. The Secretariat has prepared everything for the immediate reassuming of the activity of the Commission. ALBERT ROPER Secretary General of the C.I.N.A.;MEX 1 (May, 1 % 4 ) NOTE on the INTERNETlONiJj C01MSSI0N FOR AIR NAVIG-.JION (C.I.N.A.) The Air Convention of 13th October, 1919, entered into lorce on the 11th July, 1922, for fourteen of the signatory States which load deposited their ratifications. Article 34 oi the Convention provided for the institution, under the name of the 'International Commission for Air Navigation',-of a permanent Commission placed, as all other international Offices created as from 1919, under the direction of the League of Nations, In fact, this direction was never carried out on the C,I.N,A. which, enjoying a complete financial autonomy, maintained all its independence and contented itself with establishing a liaison with the Committee for Communications and Transit of the League of Nations, The C.I.N.A, was to be convened as soon as a majority of the signatory States had ratified the Convention: this majority (14) 1 was attained on the first deposit of ratifications and the Commission met in Paris on the 11th July, 1922, the date of the entry into force of the Convention. It fixed its seat in Paris, decided to meet at regular intervals, organized its permanent Secretariat and created for the study oi technical questions seven Sub—Commissions and two Committees, viz.: Operational Sub-Commission Legal Sub-Commission ’.Tireless Sub-Commission Meteorological Sub-Commission Medical Sub-Commission Maps Sub-Commission Materials Sub-Commission Customs Committee Committee on Standardisation The Commission is composed of the Representatives of the Governments of the-States parties to the Convention. The Sub- Commissions and Committees are composed of Experts designated by these Representatives. Ihe C.I.N.A., which at the commencement met every four months and then every half-year, holds since 1930 a Session every year in May or June. The Sub-Commissions and Committees meet in the intervals between Sessions. The C.I.N.A. has held, from 1922 to 1939, twenty—seven Sessions. The twenty-eighth will be held in Madrid or London, In/- 2 - In accordance with Article 34 of the Convention, each of the Contracting States supports the travelling expenses of its Delegation; hut the expenses of organization and operation of the Comission and its Secretariat are home hy the Contracting States, the annual budget heing voted hy the Comniission, For the year 1940 , this budget amounted to 2 , 460,000 francs and the contributions of the various Contracting States, according to the cla.ss in which they have been placed, amounted to 150 , 000 , 120,000, 90,000, 60,000 or 30,000 French francs# The scat of the C.I.N#A. is &gt; since 1937, 60 bis. Avenue d'lena, Paris. The Secretaria„t, v/hich is the only permanent organization Ox the Comission, is directed by the Secretc°ry G-eneral assisted by a Secretary. It.comprised in addition in 1939 two chiefs of bureau, one draftsman, one translator, two ladies-translators, one draitswoman, one secretary-archivist, seven typists and eleven employes or office messengers. Since 1940, the number of the Members of the staff has been brought back to ten. The duties of the C.I.N.A. are explicitly set forth by Article 34 of the Convention: It has first of all to discuss all proposals of modification Ox the ^Articles Of the Convention, whether they originate with one of the Contracting States or with the Commission itself, and no modification of these Articles can be proposed for adoption by the Contracting States unless it has been approved by at least two-thirds of the toialpossible votes. Vith regard to amendments to Annexes 'A M to 'G-' of the Convention, the powers of the Comission are formal: it has the attributes of a parliament, inasmuch as it can make any modification of the original provisions of these Annexes when such modification is approved by the majority fixed by Article 34 of the Convention; the ratification, by the Governments, of such a modification is not necessary as it would be in the case of amendments to the Articles, In lact, the Commission at each of its Sessions makes a certain number of amendments to these Annexes and its decisions enter into force four months after the notification of these amendments sent by the Secretary General to each of the Governments of the Contracting States. By the terms of Article 37 of the Convention, the C.I.N.A. is also competent to settle disagreements between Contracting States relating to the technical regulations annexed to the Convention. The procedure to be followed was fixed, during the course of the Second Session of the International Commission for Air Navigation, by the adoption of special regulations.The C.I.N.A. is therefore at the same time: 1• A Council charged with ensuring the application of the Convention and its normal evolution by proposing in: due season to the Contracting States the amendments called for by the development of international air navigation* 2. A kind of international Parliament 'having power at all times to adapt the technical regulations to the requirements of air traffic. 3. A Tribunal settling in first and last instance disagreements which may arise between -Contracting States with regard to the interpretation of the technical regulations which it has power to enact. 4. An Advisory Committee giving its opinion on questions which the States may submit for examination. 3. An Organization'for the collection and dissemination of all informa,tion, a knowledge of which is indispensable to airmen. In the performance of the three duties first mentioned, the C.I.N.A. of course acts only in the name of the States parties to the Convention. As Advisory Committee there is nothing to prevent it from giving opinions to the non-Contracting States which may consult it: none has done it up to now, but the Council of the League of Nations has on two occasions consulted the C.I.N.A. on problems within its competency. As an Information Centre, - the C.I.N.A. cannot but be universal&gt; for it is impossible to conceive a centralisation limited to a certain number of States and, as ...a. matter of fact, the C.I.N.A. receives information from numerous States non-parties to the Convention and distributes its information to all the States, Contracting or non-Contracting. Charged by various Articles of the Convention (Arts.9, 13, 16, 27, 28, 36 and Annex U H', para. 3), with the duty of communicating to the Contracting States decisions taken by each of them with regard to different matters of great importance to airmen, and of collecting and communicating (Art, 34 (d) and (e)) information of every kind concerning air navigation as well as all information relating to wireless telegraphy, meteorology and medical science which may. be of interest to air navigation, the International Commission for Air Navigation has organised a service of centralisation and distribution of all these decisions, regulations and information: Decisions taken by the States parties to the Convention are centralised at the Secretariat and notified direct to the Governments of all the Contracting States; They are also published periodically in the Bulletin of Information/Infornr.tion of the Oomission together with the regulations and information above mentioned. This Bulletin of Information was weekly up to 1940, and published in two editions, one in French and the other in English. •' Since 1 941 &gt; it is monthly, and published only in French. The plan of this Bulletin is as follows: i . a';. J*-'\ I, Conventions. Lav/s. Regulations. II. Register of aircraft. III. List of Licences issued to the flying personnel. IV. General Information relating to air traffic. V. Air traffic statistics. The C.I.N.A. has furthermore undertaken the publication of an aeronautical basic map, intended for the preparation of routes and to be- used also if necessary for the publication of aeronautical information of general interest. The sheets of this map are on sale at the Secretariat of the C.I.N.A., which performs moreover the duties of ■Central Bureau for the aeronautical local map and edits 'Aeronautical Instructions' containing, in respect of a certain number of countries, the information relating to air traffic necessary to airmen. As regards the activity of the Commission entrusted with the preparation and revision of the-technical regulations annexed to the Convention, it may be stated that a very large number of items - more than 250 - have been submitted, from 1922 to 1959, to the Commission, the following being among the most important: Classification of aircraft, . Nationality and registration marks to be borne by aircraft and call signs, . Adoption of an abridged call sign and of a radiotelegraphic alert signal for aircraft, Allocation to States non-signatory to the Convention, of nationality and registra.tion letters, Establishment of the standard minimum requirements for the issue of the airworthiness certificate with which all aircraft engaging in international navigation must be provided, Unification of the log books and documents on board aircraft, so as-to simplify the formalities to be complied with in the course of journeys by air, Limitation of the log books to the journey log, Unification of the models of the certificate of airworthiness, certificate of competency and licence, so as to permit the ready identification of their holders whatever be the language in which the documents have been issued. Progressive preparation and revision of general rules for air traffic. Regulation/-5- mmx 1 Regulation of the movements of aircraft in bad visibility. Night lighting of aerodromes. Marking of obstructions dangerous to air navigation. Lights to be borne by aircraft, Signalling in air navigation, Revision of the International Code of Signals, Production of a Signal Book for air navigation, Issue and renewal of licences and certificates of competency, Medical examinations imposed upon pilots, navigators, engineers, and radiotelegraph or radiotelephone operators on board aircraft. Composition of the operating crew of aircraft, Publication of aeronautical maps which are to be prepared in a uniform manner in all countries, Adoption of a single table of conventional signs for aeronautical information to be borne on aeronautical maps, Adoption of a universal system of aeronautical.ground markings, Collection and dissemination of meteorological information, Presentation and communication of meteorological information at aerodromes, Meteorological organization of international air routes, Revision of Annex 'H H (Customs) to the Convention, Preparation of Regulations for the international radioelectric service of aircraft, and of Instructions concerning the International telecommunication Service of Air Navigation, Unification of terms and symbols used in aeronautical technology in order to facilitate the international discussions and the translation of studios, research work and essays undertaken or realized, Exchange among the Contracting States, of all national legislation documents relating to air navigation, Organization of emergency medical boxes on board aircraft. Adoption, for calculations, of an international standard atmosphere, Unification of the characteristics required in respect of materials used in aeronautical construction, Compilation, centralisation and publication of air traffic statistics, Publication of aviation accident statistics, - • Investigation of.aircraft accidents occurring abroad, Colouring to be given to aeroplanes and seaplanes to facilitate search in case of alightings on the sea, Adoption of a uniform system for the towing, hoisting and mooring of seaplanes, Standardisation of the colours of pipings on board aircraft, Carriage of arms and ammunition on board aircraft, Sanitary control of air navigation, Use of oxygen inhalers on board public transport aircraft. Preparation of Instructions relating to sudden changes of altitude, Granting of Customs exemption for liquid fuel used in air traffic. The/- 6 - 1 The C.I.N.A. finally entered into continuous relationship with the other international organizations concerned with air navigation. Such organisations are numerous and of very different kinds. Some of them are governmental (League of Nations, International Labour Office, Pan-American Union, International Conferences on Private Aerial Lav/) or simply official because approved or set up by certain Governments(Conferences of officials or International Aeronautical Congresses). Others are due to private initiative: International Aeronautical Federation (l.'A.F.), International Air Traffic Association (l • A.T * A* ), International Aeronautical Register ' (A.I.R.). Others again comprise savants, engineers and jurists, who desire to study in common aeronautical questions in which they are specially interested. Finally, certain organizations whose activities were not originally directed to such matters have been led to concern themselves with the development of air traffic: International Radiocornnunication Conferences, Universal Postal Union, International Meteorological Organization, International hydrographic Bureau, International Office of Public Hygiene, International Chember of Commerce, etc. The C.I.N.A# followed attentively the worlf of the Conferences on Private Aerial Law and of their permanent Committee, the C.I.T.E.J.A., the Conferences of Officials (Western and Central European group, Mediterranean group and group of the Baltic and Balkan States), the Committee for Communications end Transit of the League of Nations, the International Aeronautical Congresses, the International Air Traffic Association (l.A.T.A.), The International Chamber of Commerce, etc. The Secretary General of the Commission represented it at the Sessions of these organizations and prepared, with regard to the conclusions readied, Reports which enabled the C.I.N.A. to keep posted on these various activities, to carry out interesting suggestions and to take in due season such decisions as might be interesting. A permanent collaboration was established with the International Meteorological Organization. The/-7- AI'INEX 1 The unification of conventional Signs to ho borne on Marine and aeronautical maps was studied and settled together vd-th the International Hydrographic Bureau of Monaco. The International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, signed at the Hague in 1933j 'was preppjred by the International Ox lice of Public Hygiene in close touch, however, v/ith the C.I.N.A. Finally, the C.I.N.A., officia,lly a.drnitted on the International Conferences of Telecommunication (Washington, 1927, Madrid, 1932* Cairo, 1938), was invited to present on each Conference its memorial of proposa.ls and its Representative gathered around him the aeronautical.Experts of all national Delegations, including those of the United Smates of America, Germany, even the U.S.S.R., which wore not parties eo the Convention, in order to constitute, within the Conference, the M Aeronautical Commission 1 ' charged to study and to resolve the questions put b • the development of a.ir traffic,. In order to increase the safety of air navigation, the C.I.N.A. did still more: when it found that the forum which itself constituted was too wide or too narrow for the question to be discussed, it convened Conferences of Radiotelegraph or Meteorological Experts cither World Conferences, or European Conicrencos, on which no Government, except that of the U.S.S.R., refus ed to have it self represented• World Conference of Paris European Conference of Berlin European Conference of Paris European Conference of Warsaw European Conference of Paris World Conference of Paris European Conference of Paris European Conferonce of Paris European Conference of Paris European Conference of Paris European Conference of Paris World Conference of Paris World Conference of Cracow European Conference of Berlin European Conference of Berlin - July, ~ January, - November, - September, *- November, - June, - June, - June, - June, - November, - November, - November, - May, -Juno, - June, S(Radio^ &gt;- (Radio '-(Radio •- (Radio | Radio' Radio| Radio^ Radio &amp; Mo too) Moteo) Radio) hadio &amp; Me tec) ’Radio) Radio) (Meteo 'j W fTW-l iinaliy, the C.I.N.A. created, in 1939, for the study of the technical processes and of the operational methods used in the radioeloctric service of civil aeronautics, with a view to the unification of such processes and methods, the International Radio-Aeronautical Committee (C.I.R.A.), open all the States, represented or net represented on the C.I.N.A., and the seat of which lias boon fixed at Brussels. . Germany and the United States of America, which never slipped away from the invitations sent by tlm C.I.N.A., load oclareo. themselves as being ready to ■op-rticipato in the work of this Committee.- 8 - 1 MJE 1 1 If aeronautical problems are to 110 treated, after the 'Jar, within the Eropean frame, why would the Governments not entrust the with the care to do then what it has so often and so efficiently done in the past? However, as will then he said, will the C.I.N.A. remain what it has been? It was often saJLd that international organizations were too numerous, and it may be that, on the cessation of hostilities, modifications be made in the functioning of certain of these organizations, but it is probable, that many of them shall nevertheless take up again their a.ctivitie it may be thought that the C*I.N.A. will be among the latter, and that it shall, to take into account the considerable technical progress realized during the War, pursue without delay the setting up to date of its indispensable regulations and resume its duties of eoordina.tion and defence with regard to international matters, of the general interests of Aviation.ANNEX 2 (April, 1%A) CAN THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION OP 13TH OCTOBER, 1919, PERMIT THE PULL I2EVEL0EMENT OP TO-MORROW*S AIR NAVIGATION? An Expose by Mr, ALBERT ROPER Secrotpry General of the C.I.N,A. The international air navigation is governed by two great conventions ( 1 ): - The Convention relating to the regulation of aerial navigation, signed in Paris on 13th October, 1919, - The Pan-American Convention on Commercial Aviation, signed at Havana on 20th Pebruary, 1928. In those two Conventions: - The principle which is put forward is that of the complete and exclusive sovereignty of the States over the air space above their territory; - Each Contracting State undertakes in time of peace to accord freedom of innocent passage to private aircraft; - Each State is entitled to prohibit flying over determined- areas of its territory; - Each State may reserve the internal commerce for its national aircraft; - Charges for landing and length of stay shall be the same in respect of national aircraft and aircraft of. the other Contracting States; (1) It is on purpose when we do refer here- neither to the international aeronautical conventions relating to limited objects, as are: - The Convention for the Unification of certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air (Warsaw, 1929), setting up the liability of tho air carrier and regulating the carriage documents - The Convention for the Unification of certain Rules relating to the conservatory Seizure of Aircraft (Rome, 1933); - The International Sanitoxy Convention for Aerial Navigation (The Hague, 1933), setting up the measures to be taken to avoid the propagation of epidemic diseases by aircraft, nor the special agreements concluded by certain States not being parties to the Convention of 1919, and whereof there remained only three series just before the War: - The conventions concluded by Germany with eighteen States, - Those concluded by Hungary with seven States, - Those concluded by the United States of America with ten States.ANNEX 2 - 2 - but the Pan-American Convention: - did not institute any organisation comparable with the International Comission for Air Navigation (C.I.N.A.); - does not comprise any technical Annexes which contain the regulations relating to registration marks, to the conditions for issuing certificates of airworthiness, to. the keeping of log books, to the medical conditions of competency of the operating crew, to the compiling of aeronautical maps, to meteorological information, to the operation of radiocommunications, and this is because this Convention has not instituted such a Commission as the C.I.N.A., /which is entrusted to keep up to date constantly those•regulations. The International Convention of 13 th October, 1919* e'nterod into force, on the da.tes stated hereafter, for the following thirty-three States: 1922 1923 : 1, Belgium, 1927 : 21. Sweden, 2. Croat Britain, 22. Denmark, 3. Canada, A« Australia, 1928 : 23* Netherlands 5. Union of South Africa, ' 6 . New Zealand, 1931 : 24. Norway, 7. India, 23. Iraq. 8 , Prance, 9. Greece, 1932 : 26. Finland. 10. Japan, 11. Portugal, 1934 : 27* Switzerland 12. Siam, 13. Yugoslavia, 1935 : 28. Spain, 14* Ireland. 29t Argentine : 15. Italy, . Republic. 16, Bulgaria, 1937 : 30. Peru, 17. Czechoslovakia. 31. Latvia. 1 924 : 18, Roumania, 19. Uruguay, 20. Poland. 1938 : 32. Estonia. 1939: 33• Paraguay. The Pan-American Convention is in force only for the following eleven States: 7. Honduras, 8 . Nicaragua, 9. Panama, 10. Ecup.dor, 11, Chile. 1. United States of America, 2. Mexico, 3. Dominican Republic, A* Haiti, 3, Costa Rica 6 . Guatemala,In fact, the Pan .American Convention is a regional agreement which the South American States did not hasten to ratify, and its disparition would affect only a part of the interna.tional air relations, while the abandonment of the Paris Convention o/ould deprive the air navigation of an international organization which always was acknowledged as necessary for the development thereof. ’’However, as was-recently to he read in sene American news papers, the principle of the complete sovereignty of the States over air space above their territory, enables the Governments to raise such obstructions that it is urgent to come again to the system of ”air freedom” which the prench Lav/yer P, FAUCHILLE was requiring in 1901 ”. Such authors suppose therefore that the development of air traffic would be immensely facilitated by the second system and dreadfully hindered by the first. - They should, however, observe that between the principle of ’’freedom' tempered by the right, that the States would surely maintain, to impose such restrictions as they would deem necessary in order to ensure their conservation, and the principle of 'sovereignty” tempered by the engagement, taken by the States, to grant a maximum of facilities, a difference does not exist in the practice. In 1919# the Governments preferred to put forward the principle of sovereignty, undoubtedly because it is the most reassuring and no Government has proposed, from 1919 to 1939# to give up such principle: One may doubt that it would be differently to-day, because, if many speak in the press about 'Air Freedom', it is not an absolute 'Air Freedom' that certain Governments have in mind, but solely a freedom greater than that one which air traffic was enjoying before the Y/ar. It must then be underlined that the Governments, without being impeded by the provisions of the Convention of 1919# could have shown themselves, if such had been their intention, much more liberal than they have been, because, if that Convention recognizes the sovereignty of States over the air space above their territory and foresees that they may prohibit flying over certain regions and compel aircraft to follow certain routes, it does not oblige at all the Governments to create such prohibited areas, nor to fix such compulsory routes, and t lie so Governments could have renounced and could still renounce to-morrow to raise such obstructions against air traffic. The texts of the International Convention could only impede the development of air navigation in so far as some Governments have made a restrictive application thereof: On the contrary. such/* CXtS a ° evcry P 1 ' 0 ^ 633 if thsy are largely construed V n ,^ nor coyer, 11 the Governments v/ere to-norrow willing to nn ^ t0 th ^ ^ CXtS a more liber ^ nind, they would just need unucrtake the revision of those texts, by merely applying the procedures which they have fixed themselves for a long t^ie. , , 0X0 tllG ncv - r facilities wliich the reformers are about to ask for, just aTter the Tfejr, in order to promote'the lull development of air traffic?

It is then obvious that such State can therefore only admit over ohl i t0rrl *° ry ^°raft belonging to States which have e^agod in ^ 3 th01r a y craft t0 c ™ply With such rules, that such rules v lc - necessarily be unified, and that tills system of 'Ercedon Convention ”' 1117 rGgUlated ' should consequently be defined in a .I Ix , oa ;- P uld nndertako tomorrow to prepare such a convention 1 ° f thiS should bo diScren?’ £ r the Convention, wiiich recognises the sovereignty of States over the air space above their territory, but Without 0 majS n St r er 0 ;ti t oL? 0nVentiOn ° f 1919 ^ fflaintainod Other reformers declare that air traffic sliall be entirely oblections a °+u tai ” altitude ' : they would hit against the sane that a dSiLto d- P1 ° nC '? rS ^ tal with this complication that a delicate discussion would certainly be raised on the nocessaril y optional of the altitude over which the States should renounce carrying out their sovereignty. Finally, other refomers mean that the present principle of complete sovereignty should be maintained, but that the States * ra f xlc facilities much more substantial than those provided for m the Convention of 1919,r EXT 1 ANNEX 2 4651 /■ It nay be asserted that this last proposal is alrertSy'''' unanimously admitted, while there remains to delimit the increased facilities which should be /^ranted to air traffic: Which can be such facilities? If we do refer to the precedent of maritime law, which is often called for with some inaccuracy, we may decompose sea freedom into the following elements: - Freedom of maritime traffic, - Freedom of access to the ports and to the installations.thereof, - Freedom of maritime commerce» It is what the British 'Joint Air Transport Committee' has undoubtedly done when it has inserted the following text in a Report prepared in 1943 0): In its widest meaning, air freedom presents three aspects very clearly defined: - Freedom of air passage, - Freedom of access to the ground organization of aviation, - Freedom of air commerce. These three kinds of air freedom are progressive, it is to say that the acceptation of the second entails that of the first, and the acceptation of the third that of the other two. The first, freedom of’passage, enables every aircraft, provided with a certificate of airworthiness and registered in any State whatsoever, to fly over any foreign territory, without impediment of any kind, on the condition that it shall not land. The second, freedom of access to the ground organization, enables every aircraft, provided with a certificate of airworthiness and registered in any State whatsoever, to use the airports of all other States and to take a profit of all services of ground organization (Meteo, radio-guiding, signalling, etc,) of all other States, without any impediment, on the condition that it shall carry out no commerce when landing on foreign territories. The third, freedom of air commerce, enables, in its widest meaning, every aircraft, provided with a certificate of airworthiness and registered in any State whatsoever, to engage in any commercial traffic (import, export, transit, internal traffic) in any foreign country. But such definitions are only given in the Report to show up to where the application of the theory of air freedom may go, when taken in its 'widest meaning', and the British 'Joint Air Transport Committee' does certainly not intend to suggest to its Covcrnmcnt to propose the instauration of a system so liberal^ (1 ) This text which was published in French by a foreign Review lias been retranslated here into English, extended/extended at once to all aircraft of all countries: The United States themselves did not go so far when they had prepared the Pan /joerican Convention intended, however, to promote the extension of their air lines to the whole American continent. That convention enables, in effect, the Contracting States to reserve the. internal traffic (cabotage) to their national aircraft, and the fact that such convention grants,to -^q aircraft of all Contracting States the right to engage, in all these States, in the remainder of commercial traffic (import, export, transit) explains undoubtedly that eleven American States have refrained from ratifying that convention. It is not probable that a new trial, on a world scale, would have any chance to obtain more success. ■Jo think consequently that the serious reformers limit themselves in intending to provide for the granting, in the international convention of to-morrow, of the freedom of passage and of the freedom of access to the ground organization, while leaving to the interested States the care to negotiate in special agreements the facilities to be granted to air commerce. It is, however, precisely what the Paris Convention of 1919 has done. In this Convention: - the freedom of innocent passage is expressly recognized in Article 2, ohe freedom of access to the ground organization is granted by Article 24, - the faculty of organizing the commercial traffic of aviation by special protocols from State to State is provided in Article 36 . Thenceforth, why should the opening of difficult international negotiations bo considered, with a view to the preparation of a new convention, while such a Convention exists since twenty-two years and is already in force for thirty-three States? _It is to be regretted, indeed, that the United States of ajnerica, Brazil and China, signatories of the Convention, have net yet deposited their ratifications, but their abstention did not entail any criticism of its provisions, since these States have/-7- 4651 have signed the text of 19*19 a-fid they have participated in the revisory Conference of 1929 and approved the conclusions ifhfrgfgjf• In so far as the U.S.S.R. is concerned, it did not participate in any of these negotiations. ^ ^ Such abstentions are, on the other hand, probably not definitive and, hov/cver regrettable they night be, they never c^ula justiiy the abandonnont of the results acquired during t\/enty years of international collaboration: if the proposal v/ere made to denounce the Convention of 1919, the States parties to that Convention should consider such project as dangerous, a. jr such-an operation iv/ould surely lead to a disorder, of which only the United States of America would perhaps be able to make a profit by occupying advantageous positions before the nations, nonentaneously deprived of any civil air fleet, nay try to stand up therefor. And^if some people pretended that the preparation and the setting into force of a new convention could be more rapid than the rearrangement of the old texts, it would be easy to answer Ca ? es the P* 00 ^ 1 ^ should be the sane, preparation oi tho texts, signature of the convention or of the amending protocol and later ratification of these acts, while that last phase would always entail the longest delays. , . J* mis ? lt J _ bo that a now convention bo rapidly prepared and set into -orcc between a small number of states rosolutc to end quickly, but how many years would thereafter be necessary to gather the thirty-throe ratifications or adhesions, for tho oo wC ing oi which the C«I.N*A* wanted t\ 7 enty yoars? . a °? thQ c ^ trcjc yp to ^ ascertained that, whon sovoral greet stetes have ratified an amending protocol and whon they Vffr vigourously thereafter the other Contracting states to unite to them, then the result can be rapidly attained.

And then the international Commission for Air Navigation (0*I*N»A*), oreated hy tho Convention of. 1919, will, have an urgent ta*sk to fulfil. This remarkable institution, which a. thesis approved at tho Faculty of Law of pa.ris in 193^&gt; presented a.s tho 'Most developed organization-of international law', has received, in fact, exorbitant powers* it is the onl^^ official organization able to taice, hy tho majority of votes, on behalf of tho Governments which it represents, binding decisions for these Governments. .And in fact, tho perils on v/hich tho endeavours of international institutions always come e.gain and broalc are; the difficulty of assembling all concerned, tho obligation to take unanimous decisions and the delays with v/hich tho Governments ratify such decisions. On the C#I*N«A*&gt; the unaniioity was obviously nocessaiy to amend the self-same Articles of tho Convention, which is a contract, hut, in order to modify the technical Annexes and tho Regulations which complete them it is just necessary if two—thirds of tho Contracting states arc represented in tho discussion and if the decisions are taben hy a. majority of throe—fourths of the present Members without the intervention of any further ratification. In such conditions, a. proposal for an amendment deposited by a Dolega.tion in January, for instance, or-even in May, v/hon accepted in Juno by tho commission, was notified on 1st September to all Governments of the states porties to the Convention/Convention end tho nov; text entered into force, rntomt ically, four nonths after, it is to say on 1st January of tho following year, for ell Contracting States. This period of four nonths could.oven ho abbreviated in urgent cases. There is no international procedure which pemits to adapt texts no re rapidly end this one has proved efficient sinca it has been in function for eighteen years without the rising of a. single, conflict between tho Governments represented on the C«I Tho exception:!, rapidity of this amending procedure had been deemed indispensable, by tho authors of the convention of 1919| hut the impetuosity of the aviators was necessary to have this process of majority admitted by tho Diplomats of that timed it is not certain that tho operation would bo successful again to-morrow if ell isroconceptions' of the past were swept awvay, while, if the C#I.N non.ially re as sumo a its task, just a.ftor tho Ylcx, nobody will propose to deprive it of a. prerogative, of which it made a. prudent, and together resolute and efficient, use during eighteen years. Already on the roassuiting of. civil air traffic, submitted to tho regulations, of 1939 ~ 19^0 on tho registration of aircraft, on the keeping of log books, on a.ir traffic, lights and signa!S| on meteorological transmissions and on tho employment of tclo— • oomnunicr.tions, of which regulations nobody contests the necessity, the C*I»N*A* shall, without any delay, proceed to .an examination of all those texts, in order to revise then to take into ‘account tho progress which will have been realized in all the pants of aeronautical technology during the hostilities. ; Its competent Sub-commissions, tho meetings of which have boon postponed in October, 1939, shall be convoked for this purpose in a delay of some weeks, their conclusions shall bo jncsontod, at the latest, three or four months after on the 28th Session of the Commission, which should have, taken piano in June, 1940, and tho decisions of the Commission bearing oh tho texts brought ujj to date shall be notified with no delay to tho Governments to bo enforced in a. period as reducod as possible, which period will bo. fixed by tho Commission. In such conditions, no period of disorder will paralyse tho roansuming of a.ir relations in the regions where military operations will ha.ve ceased and, at that speed of working' which wr.s already on several occa.sions that one of tho C.I*N«A#, the new regulation toxts corresponding to the new requirements of e.ir navigation will possibly bo applied some months after the reassuming of air traffic. But this rapid adaptation could not bo carried out by a. now organisation, nor in tho ,, gropings» , of a. laborious taking of contaut; the C.I*N*A* must take the initiative thereof and put itself again in functions with, so fan a.s possible, the same ropresontation as formerly, with its methods of work sot up sinco such a long time, v/ith its mechanism minutiously regulated rnd its material means, tho rapidity in functioning of which was often a. surprise in the past. Happily,/mmx. ^ - .10 - Happily, the x&gt;cmrjiont socrotarir.t of tho C*I*N*A* is in its place, its offices, the activity of which has ’been conpulsorily slowed dov^i, have not ceased to function, thanks to the support which was loyodly promted to it by tho Govemnents with v/hich it could entertain relations since four years, its natorials are in pood condition, its archives o.ro untouched and its docur.iento.tion filed again is still ncrc accessible than before; appreciating tho vodue for tho future of this impressive rorCLization, the German Authorities declared in July, 191D, that tho soo.t of tho C»I*N*A* would suffer no damage and since that data tho Secretariat has carried out its duties in every independence • It is ready to start again, at the proper tine, the instantaneous functioning of all tho machinery works of the Commission; it is not tone racy to advance the.t no improvised ion could replace such an organization* Tho. Score tenia! of the C*I»N*A* is also ready to taJco up again iixiediately the indispensable relations that it had so hapipily loiotted v/ith the other official interna.tlona.1 organiza.tions (Conferences of Telooorxiunica.tions, Universal postal union, international Motoorological Organize!ion, intema!ion o l Hydrogrc.phic Bureau, international Office of public Hygiene, international chamber of Commerce) i%ich are, in their respective spheres, competent to treat • questions* concerning tho future of air tra.ffic, ; C - Moreover, the C*I*N*A* “will not hesita.te in taking, as it has often done in the past, the initiative- of convoking conferences, either world conferences, or regional (for instance, European) conferences, if tho discussion of certain problems should justify such meetings. I Finally, if tho Governments' deemed it fit to entrust an international Authority with new functions, such a.s tho organization and the distribution of air traffic, the which is already a kind of. parliament, a. Court and a Council, could perhaps, in conditions to be determined, be invested with powers to that effect. In conclusion, it nay bo stated that; - the provisions of tho Convention of 1919, of its Annexes and of the Regulations which complete them, shall, be put again into force as soon as the suspension of nil it any operations. ■on the territories of all Contracting states; - the revision of these provisions, to take into account the technical progress realized during the yar, shall be under- takon by the C*I »Nas soon an the cessa!ion of hostilities and pursued with the maximum of rapidity; ^ contact shall bo imnedialely reestablished between tho secret ariat of the C*I*N*A* end tho official international organizatiorts; - tho extension of the Convention to all the stales having interest in tho development of air traffic shall be obstimlely scorched for by tho Contracting Stales. If this profrem is realised - and it must bo so - tho international Convention of 13th October, 1919, can not only permit, but also promote, to tho maximum, the full development of to-r-iorrov/* s air navigation.\ ^ t 5c 0 ' I OUTWARD TELEGRAM Economic &amp; Overseas Department E. &amp; 0. 7261/44 CVP^IER TELEGRAM (O.T.P») Erom Secretary 01 State To Government oi India, Department Posts and Air.

On 2nd August, the Soviet Delegation presented a memorandum on the Soviet Government’s attitude* This declared that the Soviet Government would be able to give their agreement to the inclusion in an international network of air routes passing over Soviet territory* This would ensure to interested countries the possibility of entry into U.S.S.R.and of the transit of cargo and passengers across the U.S.S.R. But this consent was conditional on transit carriage through the U.S.S.R. being by Soviet planes only. In addition, questions affecting the right of transit of goods and passengers would be regulated oy special treaties and agreements between the U.S.S.R. and other interested countries. The Memorandum stated that the Soviet-Delegation could not at the present stage indicate Soviet policy in respect of the granting of rights to foreign aircraft to fly into Soviet territory nor regarding the right to use Soviet airfields as this matter was being studied by the competent organs* As regards the establishment of international airlines connecting the U.S.S.R. and the United States, the Delegation suggested that consideration should be given to the principles of the organisation of what they described as one of the most important post-war routes i.e* Washington (or New York) - Azores Algiers-Cairo-Teheran-Astrakhan-Moscow* For the exploitation of this line, the Russians suggested that it might be possible either to organise by agreement between the Soviet and United States Governments a joint administration or company on a parity basis, or /toto agree on the co-ordination of operation of appropriate lines, connecting with each other at definite points, created for the purpose by national aviation companies of each countiy. It was proposed that the Washington - Cairo-section should be operated by United States aviation personnel and aircraft and the Moscow - Near East - Cairo section by Soviet personnel and aircraft and that both parties should make arrangements with third States over whose territory the route might pass* The question of the utilisation of airports on a non-exclusive basis was reserved by the Russians for further study* They agreed to the principle of the reservation of cabotage to national aircraft. They foreshadowed the early comnunication to the United States Government through diplomatic channels, of a draft of an agreeraein, between Soviet and United States Governments* 3* The United States reply to this memorandum took note of the Soviet position and expressed the hope that the Soviet Government might in the near future accord under mutually satisfactory arrangements rights to foreign aircraft to fly into Soviet territory, to discharge and take up traffic and to use Soviet airfields. Further study was promised regarding the suggested United States - U.S.S.R. air route via Cairo. 4* An agreed communique was released on 14th August. H.M. Embassy Washington report that the United States authorities feel that the talks have had considerable educative value and that they have succeeded in impressing the Soviet Delegates with the arguments in favour of a degree of freedom of transit, although they do not claim that Moscow is convinced. They were surprised by the Soviet proposal for a service via Cairo, having themselves suggested to Russians that they were interested in the near future in two possibilities* (a) A service via Stockholm and Helsinki to Moscow with a possible further extension to-Teheran anc/or Basra (a possible call in the United Kingdom to depend on H.M.G's attitude)* (b) A route across Northern Pacific with a landing point perhaps in the neighbourhood of Vladivostock, depending on Russian wishes and arrangements* The United States did not suggest the Cairo route* 6* The United States authorities obtained the Soviet Delegation^ concurrence in H.M.G. being kept generally informed but did not seek specific consent to our being given the Soviet memorandum* In these ' circumstances the foregoing information should be treated as particularly secret. * - The issue of the above has been duly authorised* (SD.)

BERLE 23rd August 5 ~L%1+ In many pairts oF the v/orld it is now obvious that the war area is receding $nd civil needs are steadily re—asserting themselves# The x-’acific, of course, continues to be definitely an area of active military operations, as does Europe with the exclusion of Portugal, Spain and most of Italy; but in substance war conditions no longer prevail in the southern part of the V/ estern Hemisphere and civil needs are re- asserting themselves in the &lt;v’estem Mediterranean, North Africa and the b^'dle East, where civil life is becoming re-established as the war moves northward. The highest considerations of humanity and common sense as well as the inherent interest in re-establishing so far as possible nonnal commercial life dictate the extension of civil aviation to regions now open for such conmuni cat ions. The exclusion of civil aviation from those areas on war grounds becomes increasingly less Justifiable, and on any other grounds wholly unjustifiable. The Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States alike hope for an international conference to discuss all of these matters; but it is realized that an international conference although completely successful and resulting in full agreement even on details, will not result in the immediate creation of implementing machinery, so that a considerable time must elapse before the results of such a conference can be translated into actual air conmunications and service. Xn view of this the bnited States Government feels that an interim arrangement should be adopted immediately,under and by which, to the extent that equipment is released from strictly military use, airlines can be established serving the principal centers of population, including Latin America. The securing of transit and landing rights by the United States and Great Britain for the interim period, to and in the centers to be served, is involved in this. The United States Government has already advised the British Government of the routes and landing points which the fomer proposes to establish and it is understood that the British Government will inforn us of the routes and landing points for which it is asking. The Government of the United States likewise notes that in substance the British Overseas Airways Corporation is doing this now, since it operates as a militarised service where convenient and as a commercial service whenever practicable, and is actually performing the /serviceservice of a fare-receiving common carrier in the areas from ■which the war has actually receded, although on a priority basis# On the other hand the American Air Transport Service is a wholly militarized service which neither collects fares nor performs any of the regular services of a ccramon carrier# The disparity between these two arrangements is so great as to raise considerable difficulty here with real danger of considerable public reaction# In handling interim arrangements it is suggested that our two Governments keep each other fully informed as we have been doing heretofore; that diplomatic co-operation be maintained; and that no arrangements be made by which either party will try to effect exclusion of the other or foreclose the legitimate rights of any other country# The routes, transit and landing rights established for the interim period would of course, be subject to discussion at the international conference, perhaps separately from the discussion of air navigation matters, so that the jurisdiction of that conference shall not be foreclosed# The rapid progress of the war in Europe, and especially the likelihood that there will be urgent necessity for air transport between North America and Prance before very long, makes the situation of immediate importance and calls for immediate action# Accordingly, it is hoped that the Civil Air Transport Comnittee may see its way clear to agree with the position of the United States Government in this matter. % — w ' ■ We would appreciate a very speedy reply#.-■I — Mil ' mmtm. •WMyfiSM HMnwaaaa S. a.’ 0.

My telegram 18463 of 21st August addressed Washington repeated to you regarding civil aviation. Following is outline of recent developments. As result of his discussions in Washington Lord Privy Seal has reported that Mr. Berle is now developing policy of launching out in what he calls 'post-armistice civil aviation'.. Mr. Berle said that under combined pressure of traffic, public opinion and politics United States Air Lines would move first into Spain and, as soon as facilities can be provided, on to other trunk air routes on broad pattern of international routes announced by Civil Aeronautics Board. Operations would begin as and when opportunity presents and some might begin before war ends. Mr. Berle visualizes these operations on a non-exclusive basis in co-operation with British Empire. Boradly he suggested that United States and Empire should run similar lines from British and United States terminals. Lord Beaverbrook said that H.M.G. would raise no objection to United States activity in Spain on a non-exclusive basis but that he would have to consult his colleagues on the broader issue. 2. Mr. Berle said that State Department would support any reasonable British application to Combined Munitions Assignment Board for transport types of aircraft so long as we supported similar applications for United States Air Lines. 3. Mr. Berle indicated that he wishes to launch his plans forthwith and gave impression that he would not prosecute present series of bi-lateral talks with much vigour now; instead he intends to seek landing rights in foreign countries through bi-lateral negotiations. International Conference would still be held and would review position and straighten out any difficult points. 4. Subsequently Mr. Berle added that, (1) he desired to keep in touch with H.M.G. to co-ordinate his plans with ourselves and to develop a policy agreeable to both parties. (2) in moving out for traffic in response to public opinion he wished to make it clear that he hoped to keep us in step with him; (3) he did not wish to instigate competitive struggle; his aim was not to cut out British traffic but to build up United States traffic. 5. State Department have since informed His Majesty's Ambassador, Washington that, in absence of comment from H.M.G., they wish to go ahead with bilateral negotiations for landing rights by approaches to individual Governments concerned including United Kingdom Government. \ 6. H.M.G. are considering these developments and I will inform you of their conclusions as soon as possible. First reaction here is that Mr. Berle's/v ' 2 , Mr* Eerie*s proposals are open to considerable criticism. It is doubted if suggestion in paragraph 2 offers a solution of problems likely to arise and it might well prejudice position of British Empire, while his general policy, if adopted, would seem to jeopardise prospects of a successful international conference with objects previously in view.

To: The Secretary of the Government of India Posts and Air Department, New Delhi. &lt; /CJz Subject: REPORT ON THE BILATERAL TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OP THE UNITED STATES AND THE GOVERNMENT OP INDIA DELEGATION OP THE SUBJECT OP POST-WAR AVIATION. Sir: We have the honour to submit our report on the talks which took place in Washington on the Subject of post-war civil aviation with the representatives of the Government of the United States. (2) Sir Gurunath Bewoor and Sir Frederick Tymms, the delegates from India arrived in Washington, via London on the 11th of August, 1944. While in London they had talks with the representatives of the India Office, ‘the Dominions Office and the Air Ministry. The purport of these talks was communicated to .Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai, the leader of the delegation. Mr. Trevelyan, the First Secretary to the Agent General was appointed as secretary to the delegation. (3) The talks with the United States representatives took place on the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 22nd of August. On the first three days, a detailed discussion took place on the points specifically mentioned in the agenda issued by the United States Government, a copy of which is attached to this report, and on certain points, not included therein but which were raised by the Indian delegates. On the 22nd of August when Mr. Adolph Berle, the Assistant Secretary, of State presided, a general survey of the whole position as it resulted from the talks in the previous three meetings was made and certain points were clarified. (4) As the talks were intended to be informal and exploratory in character and without any commitments on the part of the /Governments-2- Governments concerned, it was decided that no agreed minutes of the meetings need he kept, hut that each side might maintain its own notes of the talks. It was understood that this was the procedure followed hy the United States Government in connection with similar talks with other countries. (5) We attach herewith notes of the discussions which took pl^oe on the four days and would draw particular attention to the notes of the meeting of the 22nd August. After the close of the talks it was decided that an agreed press communique’ should he issued to the press. We attach a copy of the communique’ which was issued on 28.8.44. (6) The talks were full and frank and were conducted in a most friendly spirit. The representatives of the United States llovernment appeared to he anxious to convince the Indian Delegates of the reasons which had led them to adopt a definite attitude in regard to matters on wl^ch we differed from them. We mention helow the important points which were discussed and the . f 1 ' o r&gt; ' p - results of the di's'cushiond.* I INTERNATIONAL AIR AUTHORITY The United States Delegates made it clear that they were not prepared at present to accept an authority having power of control in the commercial and economic sphere. It will he understood that the need for such an authority arises in an acute form only if a measure of freedom of the air for regular air transport is accorded in the international convention - see II helow. The principle reasons given hy the United States delegates arc;- (a) The U.S.S.R. is not prepared to accept any such authority and the attitude of China is also similar to that of U. S. S.R. (h) Public opinion is U.S.A. is not willing to accept any such authority at present. (c) There is little information at present,available to determine the nature of the constitution of such /authority-3- authority, how it would function and what principle it should observe in alloting quotas for air routes, in regulating frequencies and in fixing rates and controlling subsidies. They fear that such an -authority would probably retard the free development of air transport. They would prefer, therefore, to settle air routes and frequencies through bilateral agreements and to control rates and subsidies by exchange of information, publicity and negotiation. They contend that only when an authority with pure advisory and study functions has been in operation for some time, has exercised the function of arbitration on matters voluntarily submitted to it and has gathered experience and created confidence, public opinion in the United States is only to be prepared to give some powers of control to it. They are not prepared to declare publicly at present, even in principle, that such a controlling authority may come into existence in the future. We suggested that such an authority is not created now, it would be much more difficult to create it at a later date because, in the meantime, powerful vested interests would have come into existence. The smaller countries, and those backward in Aviation would, on the other hand, find protection for their interests and secure their due share, if an international controlling authority is brought into existence from the outset, otherwise they may be completely overwhelmed by the more advanced countries. The Americans were not, however, prepared to accept these arguments as noted. It appeared to us that the Americans are genuinely convinced of the serious difficulties in the way of securing general agreement to the acceptance of the principle of control and, even if this were accepted, they fear that there would be /equally- 4 - equally serious difficulties in securing agreement on the constitution of the controlling authority and in settling the methods and principles to he adopted in exercising control in economic and commercial matters. They emphasised also that it would take considerable time to secure an agreement and that this would delay the starting of international services. The Americans feel that a controlling authority of the nature contemplated would tend to retard and delay the rapid development of the air services which they are anxious to commence because they have the planes, men, and the money. They regard the provision of international air transport as something which the world in general and the American people in particular expect America to attempt and feel that the American public would regard it as a surrender of their natural right and a dereliction of America’s duty to the world if the attempt was not made. They appeared to suspect the motives of those who advocated such controlling authority and asked whether Great Britain, which seems anxious to control the development of air services, would be equally ready to create an international authority to control shipping s^rvice^ in a similar manner. They saw no reason why they should not be t permitted to take advantage of their resources and capacity to secure in the field of air transport a position similar to that achieved by Great Britain in the past in shipping. ,As a result of the talks it seems to us that, if -ny international agreement is to be secured at all, insistence .on the creation of a controlling authority in the commercial and economic sphere will have to be given up for the time being, at least, and we shall have to take steps to protect our interests hy such bilateral agreements as we can make with other countries. The iimericans made it clear during the talks that they intend to exercise discretion in granting operating rights to countries who might wish to make bilateral agreements with them, but won’t regard as unreasonable the attitude of any country which refused /America-b- America operating rights for reasons which they consider to he unsatisfactory. Bilateral agreements could, they admitted, be for limited periods whith advisory and recommendatory functions in the economic fields and subject to revision. The Americans Relieve that an international authority would secure many of the results which a controlling authority is intended to secure. In this connection, we would draw attention to the attitude of Mr. Fraser the Prime Minister of New Zealand as conveyed to us by the Americans, Mr. Fraser is reported to have said that he was in favour of full internationalisation of all international services but if this was found to be unacceptable to other countries, he was prepared to accept what can be achieved at present'and to wait for further progress towards the constitution of a controlling authority as a result of experience. In the technical field, however, Mr. Berle indicated, in the final discussion, that the United States Government would be prepared to modify their attitude and agree to regulation of technical matters by an international authority. This is certainly a step in the direction of the object which we wish to achieve. They recognise that, in the technical field, recommendations would not do and that in some matters the provisions of the Convention must be mandatory and in others, of the nature of minimum standards. Their intention is to study the various technical problems and prepare draft annexes to the proposed international convention and to place these for the consideration of the international conference when it meets. II FREEDOMS OF THE ^IR (l) Right to innocent passage (2) Right to land for non traffic purposes. The United States•delegates were asked whether they were prepared to grant these two freedoms universally on a reciprocal basis in any convention that might be agreed upon, irrespective of the question of control. Our own position was that we /were-6- were prepared to grant these freedom^ eubjectito agreement on the constitution of an international air authority with powers of control in the economic and commercial sphere. The United States delegates stated that they were prepared to grant these freedoms 'but would reserve the power to withdraw them from any country which unreasonably withheld grant of commercial rights to American air services. They would provide in the convention itself for such pov^er of withdrawal. This means in fact that they are not prepared to make these freedoms absolute. As regards commercial rights* i.e., freedoms 3,4,5 (Freedom 3 - Right to land traffic from country of origin of aircraft. Freedom 4 - Right to pick up traffic for country of origin of aircraft. Freedom 5 - Right to pick up and to land traffic from and to a country neither of which is the country of origin of the aircraft), the United States are not prepared to grant any of these freedoms on a multilateral basis. They seemed to recognize that the grant of these freedoms on a multilateral basis must involve some measure of control as, otherwise, there may be economic chaos, but they prefer to exercise such control through bilateral agreements rather than through an international controlling authority. We expressed our preference for the latter alternative. Our own position is that we are prepared to grant freedom 3 and 4 on a multilateral basis, if a controlling authority is accepted, but,as regards freedom 5, we have not reached a final decision. The United States delegates stated, however, that they would not agree to the Canadian proposal which would limit commercial rights to freedoms 3- and 4 only. It is the wish of the United States Government to commence negotiations for bilateral agreements now with countries to and through which they desire to establish air services. They suggested that, to such countries, they would be prepared to grant equal reciprocal rights. We pointed out that such /reciprocalreciprocal rights might have little*value, to one of the parties. For example, while the right to operate across India would have great value to the U.S.A., a similar right to India to operate across the U.S.A. would have little value, first because India not at present equipped or ready to operate such services and, secondly, because such a right could not be exercised without securing bilateral agreements with all the countries on the route to U.S.A. and this may be more difficult for India than for the U.S.A. The U.S. delegates urged that by establishing a service to or through India, they would be conferring a benefit on India in bringing and taking passengers and goods and providing international travel facilities and this in itself should be sufficient consideration. They added that they would reserve freedom to refuse bilateral agreements to a country which in their opinion had no traffic interests in their country. It is in this manner that they apparently propose to exercise some control over the establishment of an unlimited number of services. They, however, wish to see no limit placed on the frequencies which may be operated by a country when it has negotiated the right to operate on a particular route. They would leave this to commercial operating companies to determine on economic considerations. 111 BILATERAL AGREELiUNTB VERSUS liULT I LA TERAL AGREEME NT The United States does not accept the principle of multilateral agreement on operating and commercial rights for air transport. The United States delegates emphasised that even i.f it were conceded that such an agreement would eventually De achieved, it would still be necessary to proceed with bilateral negotiations, because of the time necessary to conclude a multilateral agreement. The wide differences of opinion which have come to light in the course of the talks which they have had with various countries,(these are (l) United Kingdom, (2) U.S.S.R. (3) China .(4) New Zealand, (5) Holland (6) Belgium (7) Canada) /indicate-8- indicatc that it is necessary to proceed through bilateral agreements if the early establishment of air services is desired. They recognize that under this system any country on the route can hold up the establishment of an international air service tC refusing an agreement but they feel confident that they can overcome such obstruction by various means. We indicated our fears that resort to interim bilateral agreements might prejudice the achievement of an international agreement or delay it considerably. The Americans do not think so and while not admitting that they would be prepared to accept the principle of multilateral agreement on commercial rights and international authority, appeared willing to discuss, in the international conference the possibility of placing on a multilateral basis, agreements reached as a result of the bilateral negotiations which they now contemplate. This, of course, does not meet our point of view. As regard the initial allocation of routes and frequencies it was made clear by them that there was no intention of having ad interim international body to make such allocations initially but what they had in mind was that an-initial distribution of operations might be agreed on a provisional basis through friendly talks between the countries which are interested in and desire and are in a position to - establish international services now. Any such arrangement would be subject to revision or modification at a later stage in the light of experience either through consultation or by the international authority if one is agreed to and established. IV AMERICAN aIR SERVICES TO INDIA The Indian delegates were asked to state whether India would be prepared now to enter into a bilateral agreement with the United States for the establishment of an air service to and through India. We replied that any such bilateral agreement could not but prejudice an international agreement but that in any case we were not in a position to discuss such a proposal. /We-9- We had come to Washington to talk over the possibility of securing an international agreement, and not to discuss bilateral £^panflements, At the same time we assured the United States delegates that India had no intention of obstructing the free and speedy development of air services and that we had no doubt that any proposal from the United States Government would in due course receive the careful and anxious consideration of the Government of India.. v HOLDING of international conference In reply to our definite question, the United States delegates stated that, in spite of the differences of opinion which ha-ve come to light during the course of bilateral talks, they are stilj. hopeful about the holding of an international conference. Apart from the question of commercial rights there is a large field in which agreement is likely to be secured and particularly so in the technical field. They fear, however, that it would take considerable time to reconcile the differences of opinion, some of them on very vital matters and to secure a general agreement; They therefore press their own proposal to proceed with bilateral negotiations for operating and commercial rights. (7) We have now dealt with the principal points on some of which there was a material difference of opinion between the United States delegates and ourselves.' Apart from these however, there was an agreement on a number of points and we mention below some of them. (8) It was agreed that each country should reserve the right to restrict the carriage of commercial air traffic between two points which were each under jurisdiction, to aircraft of its own nationality, (i.e., cabotage). Control of rates and competitive practices and limitation of subsidies were admitted to be desirable. We could not agree however, as to how such control should be exercised. While the India delegation urged an international controlling authority, the Americans were in /favourfavour of mutual consultation and publicity and hoped that a solution could be found this way. There was agreement as to the necessity of uniform operating and safety standards and the standardization or co-ordination of aids to navigation and communication facilities. As already stated, the United States would be prepared to accept a regulating authority in these matter ,iS regards air ports and facilities, there was agreement as to the right of each country to designate the air ports of entry and to nominate the terminal aerodromes for services terminating in a country. The use of air ports and facilities should be granted on a non-disrriminatory basis. The provision of airports and facilities in isolated areas whose governments are either unwilling or unable to provide such facilities, should be made at the expense of the countries or air lines who require them. While agreeing’that States should reserve the right to declare prohibited areas, the Americans were also prepared to agree that a liberal policy should be followed in this matter. They agreed that an international convention should define the extent of prohibited transport and the rights of States in this connection. It was agreed to be necessary to define State aircraft and their status. It was recognised to be necessary to deal with the subject matter of sundry existing conventions, relating to carriage by air, third party risks, air collision, salvage and precautionary arrest and that these will have to be co-ordinated with the air convention. (9) On the subject of sale of aircraft and the disposal of surplu aircraft after the v/ar, the United States delegates volunteered the information that they would make available supplies of air planes and equipment to all nations on a non-discriminatory basis and that the price charged would be the same as to their own nationals. They do not wish to linK this matter with the negotiation for rights of operation and commercial rights, butfeel that they could hardly make planes available to a country which unreasonably refused to grant operating and commercial rights in its territory to America. It was clear, therefore, that in spite of their professions, the United States would use their premier position in the aircraft industry to secure concessions for their air lines. (10) It will be seen from the previous paragraphs that the principal difference of opinion between the Indi-an and United States delegations is with regard to the grant of any measure of freedom of the air in a multilateral convention and the con-current question of the powers of an international air authority in the commercial and economic sphere. It is our view that, whether of their own conviction, or under pressure from their public opinion in general and, in particular, from the interests concerned, the United States Administration are determined to make full use of their present advantage in the field of air transport. They do not appear to be ready to sacrifice any of these advantages for the sake of international solidarity or fair play. They appear to be confident that they would be able to secure on a bilateral basis all the agreements they.may need for the establishing of international air services. Their position is strengthened by the fact that the U.S.S.R. is not at present prepared even to allow foreign air lines to go into Russian territory, nor to admit any rights of transit over their country. The attitude of China to the proposed international authority is the same as that of the Russians, though they are prepared to grant transit rights to specific countries through specific corridors and would agree to a body having advisory and recommendatory powers only. In view of the attitude of the United States, the U.S.S.R. and China, it seems to us that there is little chance of achieving the main objective, namely a greater measure of freedom of the air on a world wide basis associated / wi th-12- with the constitution of an international authority with powers of control in the 'commercial and economic field. One alternative which rray have tr&gt; hot given aonsi tOrati-on is the possibility df iarrlvirrrf ??t’an‘international convention, incorporating a measure of freedom of the air coupled with control of air transport, between those other countries who -- subscribe to these principles, or similar arrangements on a regional basis. To the extent that such arrangements excluded the U.S.A., U.S.S.R., and other countries from the privileges they expect to enjoy under a system of bilateral agreements, they would hardly be conducive to world amity, and moreover they would probably jeopardise the attainment of w^nld wide agreement on those other matters which appear to be within reach. Vve feel therefore, that India should, if necessary, be prepared to accept an international convention to which the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R. and China could subscribe, with an international authority constituted to regulate and control in the technical field and with advisory and recommendatory functions in the commercial and economic field. Prom the point of view of India alone, the operation in itself of an uncontrolled number of air services (subject to the normal regulations) across India with no traffic rights would not harm India but would bring in revenue. We think that no serious danger is involved to India in agreeing to an international authority with limited powers. India can, to some extent, protect her commercial and operating interests by making due provision in such bilateral agreements as she may enter into with other countries, though she would be left to establish her position in international air transport against greater competition than if she were protected by a multilateral convention of the type we have discussed. an the principle enunciated by the United States delegation, it would Tte open to India to decline to enter into an Agreement with any country on the ground of absence of traffic interests or any other reasonable grounds or to make such conditions as she may think fit to protect her aviation and other interests if she does enter into an agreement. /We L-13- v v We understand that a communication has been sent to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom by the United States asking for a bilateral agreement with Great Britain and that this is at present under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. We have no doubt that before arriving at a final decision, th Government of India will obtain the vicwsof His Majesty’s Government and ascertain the kind of policy they propose to follow with regard to the proposal made to them. It would, of course be advantageous if the countries and the British Commonwealth and Empire could, as far as possible, adopt a uniform policy in this matter. (11) The talks we have had have thrown considerable light on the reasons which have actuated the United States in the attitude they have adopted with regard to an international air convention and authority. We feel that the holding of an international conference would be advantageous, and is indeed necessary, and that many points on which agreement now seems difficult might be clarified in an international conference and some measure of agreement probably secured. Even if no agreement were to be reached in the commercial and economic field, it would be a great step forward if a wider agreement (if possible world-wide) in the technical and other fields covered by the International Covention for the Regulations of Air Navigation 1919, omild be secured. In fact such agreement, giving effect to changes necessitated by recent progress in aviation, is essential if international air transport is to develop on sound lines with due regard to the safety of the operations and of the public. Apart from the talks, we have secured considerable useful information relating to aviation from the officers of the United States Government, who have been very helpful to us in all our enquiries.(IS) In conclusion we wish to record our appreciation of the services of our Secretary, Mr. Trevelyan. We are sending a copy of this report to the India Office with spare copies for the *—* Dominions Office and Air Ministry for their information. (Signed) SD/ G. S.Bajpai SD/ G.V. Bewoor SD/ P.TymmsMr. Wood, I would be grateful if you could send to the External Department copies of recent telegrams exchanged with the Government of India regarding postwar civil air transport and put them on the distribution list for further telegrams on this subject. They may like to send a telegram to the Government of India referring to our last important telegram to the Posts and Air Department saying that we assume that they will pass on to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf such information as they think desirable. That procedure will, I think, be preferable to the repetition from here of telegrams to Bushire, as our telegrams to India include a lot of material, e.g. regarding inter imperial discussions which do not concern the Political Resident. ^mamammmtmmmm — Received under Mueca dated 8th July, 1944.

I understand that a subsidiary of P.A.A. called, I believe, P.A.A. Africa Ltd., are operating the Southern Arabian route to India uncer contract with the U.S.A.T.C. It is a fact that the arrival and departure boards at all stations on the route e.g. Salalah, Masifah and Karachi mark P.A.A. planes ana pilots as such, but the aircraft and crews are not distinguishable to me from those of the U.S.A.T.C. Again, the Commanding Officers at Salalah and Masirah now are ex P.A.A. personnel and have nearly always been chosen from ex P.A.A. personnel. 5. I was told that P.A.A. have, reluctantly, been forced to recognise that Masirah is the most important place for them within the Sultans territory, and are therefore concentrating on it in preference to any other landing ground. I say reluctantly because Balaian*s position half way between Aden and Karachi is ideal, but the monsoon period renders the landing ground unsafe for a period of three months in the year. Low that the U.S.A.T.C. (and/or P . A. A. ) are operating larger planes, such as the C46 (Commando) and DC4*s and B24*s (Fortresses), they can easily fly direct from Aden to Masifah, out, unprofitable, 1 i.agine. :ommercial xy, tni s might be 4. I heard a rumour just before leaving Salalah recently to the effect that the U.S.A.T.C. were practically closing down Salalah and would maintain only sufficient personnel there to refuel planes in emergency. I feel we should not overlook P.A.A*s interest in developing this route as it is still tne shortest route from South Africa and South America to the East, and in view of their present activities, the Sultan would appear to be justifies in expecting post war civil air lines, especially P.A.A., to operate it after the war. 6 .
