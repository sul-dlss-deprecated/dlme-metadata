Wife ^ o. i.0/^ at. y« Secretary, Political Department Ai JT^' Please see the Colonial Office letter of September 23rd and its enclosures on the question of the recognition of the title of 'Prince of the Quaiti State' which the Sultan of Mukalla wishes to confer on a younger son of the late Sultan Umax* It will be seen that the point on which the Colonial Office consult us is the recognition of the proposed new title in India 'in view,of the close connections between the Mukalla ruling family and the Na^dim* s Court at Iftrderabad'. This Department has little or no information which will help us in answering the Colonial Office letter. Scattered through the attached bound volume (Collection l/6l) are some papers connected with the arrangement mentioned in the second paragraph of Mr. Champion's letter of August 21st, whereby Sultan Muhammad Bin Umar was dispossessed of his claim tojsuccession to the Sultanate. We have not either of the despatches to which Mr. Champion refers, and the only mention in our papers of the conferment on Sultan Muhammad of the title of Prince, in part compensation for being thus ousted, , is in an Aden Political Intelligence Summary dated August 18th, 1937 (P.Z. 6121/37) • For the rest our papers about the affair deal with the question of preventing Sultan Muhammad, who ills living in Hyderabad, from going to Mukalda in order to agitate his claim. For this purpose the NAJfctm's Government, in response to a request from the Crown Representative, for a time compelled Muhammad to remain in Hyderabad. The papers do not reveal the nature of the relationship between the ruling families of Hyderabad and Mukalla (see P.Z.4705/37 8062/37, 23/38, 660 / 38 , 2766 / 38 ). Our papers (Collection l/28) about the Lahej succession case mentioned in the fourth paragraph of Mr. Champion's letter are also attached. But they too are unhelpful in the present connection. We were not consulted in 1937 about the conferment of the title of Prince upon Sultans Muhammad and Awadh; and in the present case I doubt if it was necessary for Mir. Champion to mention the Government of India in his reply to the Sultan. If he had not done so, it seems improbable that the Colonial Office would have consulted us at all. Perhaps we might answer them to the effect that we see no objection to the reply proposed in paragraph 3 of their letter, and that we do not consider it necessary for them to include in their reply any mention of the point raised in their paragraph 4* Do you agree? If not would you please advise what should be said instead? You may even like to take transfer of the Colonial Office letter. 'fr'yy Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, * L and the following Number quoted: 78018/42. $0* i :\b« iii 23 September, 1942. Sir, 13 / r- I am directed by Viscount Crariborne to transmit to you, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Amery, a copy of a semi-official letter, and of its enclosure, from the Chief Secret'ahy of Aden, in which he states that the Sultan of Mukalla wishes to confer the title of ,, Prince ,, or 'Amir' on a younger son of the late Sultan ’Umar, and has been informed that no objection need be offered to the conferment of the title of 'Prince of the Quaiti State', but that it cannot be promised that the title will be formally recognised by His Majesty’s Government or by the Government of India. The second paragraph of Mr. Champion’s letter refers to the bestowal of the title of 'Prince' upon the present Sultan’s son (on his recognition as Heir Apparent) and upon the elder son of the late Sultan, as part of the settlement which deprived him of his claim to the succession. SecTpoCuep y , stP 942 Mr. Champion has asked for advice regarding the treatment of the question of title, and it is proposed to inform him that the reply given to the Sultan of Mukalla appears to be suitable, and that it is not considered advisable to lay down any general rules or restrictions on this subject, or to recognise or prohibit the use of customary Arab titles in any special manner unless there appears to be any particular reason for doing so in an individual case. n, 4 : , Before this reply is sent.

I am. Sir, Your most obedient servant.No* C/3840 THE SECRETARIAT, ADEN. 21st August, 1942 My dear Sir Bernard; His Highness the Sultan of Mukalla has i • expressed a wish to confer the title of 'Prince' (or 'Amir') on Sultan Husein bin , Umar, son of the late Sultan, and His Highness*s son-in-law, and we have replied, that no objection need be offered to his appointment as 'Prinfce of the Quaiti State' but that we cannot promise that His Majesty*s Government or the Government of India will formally recognise the title. . * G Confidential (2) of 18th March 1937 with atta^hTn^f. s and to ^ne secretary of State*s reply dated_22nd, Qclo berr 1937 , you will see that the Aden Government undertook to address Sultan Muhammad bin ’Umar, His Highness’s cousin, by the title of 'Prince' as part of the settlement of th6 succession question, and that Sultan *Awadh is entitled to the title by virtue of his being recognised as Heir Apparent. A formal deed of appointment was eventually - September 1941issued by His Highness to Sultan Muhammad bin ’Umar and forwarded to him by the Aden Government. I attach a copy of this. time admitted the Sovereign rights of the rulers of the Aden Portectorate; but although the Aden Govern ment may find it politic or expedient to address some of their cadets as 'Prince' His Majesty’s Government is not committed to do so. Sultan Fadhl as Heir Apparent by His Highness the Sultan of Lahej is reported in your Confidential If you will refer to your own de spatch The Colonial Office have several despatch Lieutenant Colonel Sir Bernard Reilly, K.C.M.G. ,C.I.E.,O.B.E.despatch No. 65 of 22nd March 1953 and the reply is the Secretary of State’s despatch of 15th July. ^ Neither the Aden Government nor His Majesty’s Bf Government recognised this appointment nor in consequence the title of Amir which has since become popularly associated with it. In Zanzibar, Sir John tells me, the Sultan’s only son was frequently but incorrectly referred to as Prince but never by him. I should be very glad if you would advise how we should treat this question of title. It must perhaps be remembered that the Mukalla ruling family has the closest ties with the Nizam’s Court at Hyderabad (Deccan), and this may make some latitude permissible.
