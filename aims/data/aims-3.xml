                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'times new roman', times;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 69: Educational Transitions in Post-Revolutionary Spaces: Islam, Security, and Social Movements in Tunisia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;"&gt;In this podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.luc.edu/education/about/faculty/julestavisd.shtml"&gt;Dr. Tavis D. Jules&lt;/a&gt; is interviewed on his recent book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ecommons.luc.edu/facultybooks/136/"&gt;Educational Transitions in Post-Revolutionary Spaces : Islam, Security and Social Movements in Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored with Dr. Teresa Barton. Jules and Barton trace the development of Tunisia’s educational system to the 2010/2011 contestatory events that led to the Tunisian Revolution and embarked on a period of large-scale institutional reform, including education sector reform. This post-Revolutionary reform has primarily been concerned with providing young Tunisian citizens with the necessary skills for a rapidly changing job market.  In his presentation, Jules engages with the issue of how a strong educational system produced generations of educated citizens, but whose most recent generation is frustrated by a weakened socio-economic system unable to absorb a young and educated workforce.  The book itself traces the history and evolution of Tunisia’s educational system since independence in 1956 to the contemporary period,  and ties its analysis to an « educational transitologies framework ». Through several chapters, the book engages and explores themes related to education, including security, gender, political Islam and social movements and analyses these comparatively pre- and post-political transition which commenced in 2011. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;"&gt;In this podcast, Dr. Jules was invited to answer a number of questions touching upon the following themes : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;"&gt;Definition of the concept of conscientization and its importance to understand the role of education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;"&gt;The common link that the book draws between education and Islam, security and social movements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;"&gt;The book’s methodology to study 'educational transitologies' and what the example of Tunisia tells us about this theoretical framework. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
