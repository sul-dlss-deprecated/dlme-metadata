The Residency , Buahire, the 5th February 1937. D.O.No.175-3. A Gould you please refer to India Office endorsement No. P.2.9098/36 on letter No.CF/676/36 of the 19th November 1936 from the Secretariat, High Commission for Palestine, to the Colonial Office, on the subject of a possible Kuwait - Haifa commercial motor route. 2. For the reasons given in paragraph 6 et seq below I think perhaps it might be convenient to link this subject up with that of the defence of the Gulf in tine of war f dealt with in my demi-official letter No.82-3 of the 18th c/\^\ IjX January 193/ to Metcalfe, copy sent to Valton under my Printed letter No.83-8 of same date. 3. As you are aware the idea of the route in question was first raised by de Gaury last Surrmer. His general idea was that it might be possible to open up a route as follows: Kuwait• Hafr-al-Batin, Saudi Arab frontier fort. tfater. Umra-ar-Radhurama, Saudi Arab fort is being built. 0at er. Lina, Saudi Arab fort is being built. tfater. Birkat-ash-Shaihiya. vater. Junction with the Nejef-Hail M pilgrim H route. Jauf, Saudi Arab provincial centre, wireless, water etc.fim % go in Arabia, 1*8 a fairly good water supply, an important consideration. It would traverse the territories of three States! Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Palestine (Transjordan;. 4. Nothing concrete could come of thia scheme until we bad a report on the route, and de Saury suggested that he should motor over it with this object in view. I backed the proposal (de Saury has had considerable experience of this sort oi work), but owing to the troubles in Palestine the scheme was dropped for the time being. When quieter conditions prevailed it was again put on the ta-pis# 5. The route, if it ever came into being, would afiect Transjordan and Palestine, and the Palestine letter quoted above indicates that the reaction of the Palestinian and Transjordanian Authorities to the scheme is far from favourable. Briefly, these Authorities are of opinion that such a route would adversely affect Palestinian and Transjordanian trade in various ways. If this view is accepted by the Colonial Of! ice, and it certainly seems to me that strong arguments nave been adduced, then as far as I am concerned I am content to let the subject drop as a commercial one. 6. There is, however, the strategical aspect. Prom Palestine - Transjordan the present air route (both for Imperial Airways and Royal Air Force machines), and the motor route, runs to Bagdad, and the air route then runs Basra, Kuwait, etc. probably, for various reasons, this will always remain t.~e main route both for Civil and Royal Air Force machines. I can ; ineigine circumstances, however, .*en in an emergency an alternative direct air route Palestine - Kuwait, as indicated by de Gaury, might be very useful - if practicable. 7. / f7. Further, I can also intfigine circumstances tfhen the use of such a route, or part of it, by a mechanized force, might be desirable. Royal Air Force armoured cars have operated both from the Kuwait and Transjordan ends, and so these sections of the route are doubtless well-known. As far as 1 am aware, however, the middle sections have not been explored from the point of view of practicality for cars. 8. If therefore the Royal Air Force Authorities, who are the people most concerned, are interested from the strategical point of view in the proposed route, it would still be worth while for de Gaury to make his suggested trip, and produce a report 0 n it from the Royal Air Force and military aspect. In this case permission would have to be obtained from the Saudi Government for him to traverse that portion of it which lies in Saudi territory. I daresay the Saudi Government will raise no difficulties as they recently (about a year ago) gave permission for him to drive from Jedda to Kuwait, a much longer tour, through their territory. 9. If the trip is to be done it should be set on foot fairly soon before the Summer is once more upon us. It - the trip - would not involve a prolonged absence of de Gaury from Kuwait. The actual motor journey would not take many days, and he could return from Palestine by air. * I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, Butler (Senior Naval Officer), Mitchell (Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq), de Gaury, Loch and .Vatts.
