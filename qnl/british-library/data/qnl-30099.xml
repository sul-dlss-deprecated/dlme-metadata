Military and gendarmerie patrols were heavily reinforced and the curfew was more rigidly applied than ever* A stricter control was exercised over travellers between towns and on the Tnhriz- -Julfr railway and, in the interests of security, the province was divided into ten gendarmerie areas* 67* The twenty-first day of the month of Azer, 1326, (13th* December 1947) arrived but brought with it no return to Azerbaijan of Ja f far Pishevar^a f Democrats # , no Vengeance Party (Hizb-i-Intigem) to 'liberate* the people* Instead, the day was given up to official celebrations and popular rejoicing* 'even those who neither celebrated nor rejc^^ were at least relieved that the worst had not come true, at * any rate for the present*68. The celebrations began with the decoration by Marshal Shahbakhti of some seven hundred 'heroes of Azerbaijan 9 and of Qeneral Zangineh for their services in the liberation of the province* After speeches appropriate to the occasion had been made by the Governor General, All Mansur, and others a bronze statue of the Shah (the gift of a merchant named AbdulhuseinTAvakkoli was unveiled in the Municipality Snuaro. To the music of bands schoolboys then marched past. There followed a military parade at which Marshal Shahbakhti took the salute while, overhead, aeroplanes dive-bombed and showered commemorative leaflets. A ceremony in the Garden of the Red Lion and Sun at the grave of the 'Unknown Soldier' who laid down his life for tho.'salvation of Azerbaijan concluded the morning's celebrations, and the afternoon was spent by the public parading past the Shah's statue and up and down the main streets. Similar celebrations were held in the other centres in Azerbaijan where a portrait of the Shah was displayed. In Tabriz curfew time was made one hour later (11 p.m. ) in celebration of the occasion. 69. Although press and wireless reports may have exaggerated the intensity of the enthuslaan and rejoicing on this occasion, and many a scallywag may have flown the Persian flag for safety's sake, there is no doubt that the people of Azerbaijan in general were happy to demonstrate once more their patriot!am and their dislike of foreign interference. To many of them the progress made during the preceding twelve months may well have compared unfavourably with the not inconsiderable achievements of the Democrat regime. Nevertheless, they looked to Tehran and the Crown, and lived in hopes that the repeated assurances that their welfare was had at heart would soon be translated into action. 70. I5IX1CATION . Early in the month the Minister of Sducation, Dr. Sediq, /paid.V ^ -3- f EXT ! 390 19 (H) paid a Yisit to Tabriz. In a speech in vdiich he referred to the inauguration^ during his term of office* of the University of Tabriz* he assured his listeners tjiat the Central Government attached great importance to ^zerbaijan* ’'the cradle of the first Iranian prophet* Zoroaster”. Since ancient times the province had been the home of civilisation in Persia. From the early days of the Constitution in x j ersia it had ^ reduced men of science end letters and politicians. Dr. Sadia had confidence in the patriotism of the Azerbaijanis for they had always heriocally weathered the etoms that had raged over the country. He realised the deficiencies of the educational system of the province. He knew* for instance, that* owing to the lack of school buildings, there were nt least sixty pupils in each class instead of a maximum of twenty or twenty-five. But the Government hod the interests of Azerbaijan at heart and would remedy these deficiencies. Kducation* however* was the concern not only of the Government but also of the people. The Azerbaijanis should therefore give their moral and financial suj&gt;port to educational schemes. It was hoped, if the necessary credits were forti cauing, to open one school for -“very four villages. Dr. 3adia added that much needed salary increases for the poorly-paid hea&amp;oasters and schoolteachers had been proposed by him and approved by the ttajlls during the previous year. 71. The Director of Education for Azerbaijan* Sadi'! Jilzhad* reported that during 1326, the current year, pupils had attended 240 Government elementary schools* 29 ;3eeoa.jru\v schools and 4 teachers’ training schools in Azerbaijan. This represented an increase of about 60,000 pupils. In ? d&amp;ition, 9 $ schools for adults had been established in Azerbaijan, with almost 4,000 pupils. Out of the donations of the 3hah to education in the province the sum of 19^ million lials had been earmarked for the construction of elementary schools for Tabriz. ■' •••••72 . ; jblic ■o;au . After en interval of a year, goods traffic by rail was resumed bet?^een Mianeh and Tehran^ the bridges between r -onJan ?=jnd Minneh # demolished by the i*etreating Azerbaijan i^emoerats in December, 1946, having been repaired* Work on the terrain between kianeh and Tabriz continues, providing a certain amount of occujjation for the unemployed. Much hard tunnelling, however, remains to be done, and the Mayor of Tabriz, Mr. H. Kelantary, himself on engineer, says that, while under Reza Shah it might have taken only two years more to link Tehran by rail with Tabriz, it will take nearer ten now. 73. J J^CTlOffS . Proper elections have not yet taken place in the Kurdish centre of Mahabad (Movember Diary, paragraph 64). On the 30 th. December the press reported that the Ministry of the Interior had given Instructions to the authorities there to summon a Supervisory Committee with a view to the elections being held. ' 74. COMCLUSIOa . At the end of December some of the atmosphere of uncertainty, if not of tension, remains. The London Conference of Foreign Ministers has failed and only one country is responsible for its failure. Tabriz, for all its well-stocked shops, its abundant white bread and teeming bazaar, seems to give an impression of forlomnesa* The exodus to Tdtiran has not ceased and Persian officials, who dislike the curfew and all it implies, are more often than not homesick for Tehran. W et appeared to be an imaedlate threat failed to materialise but Soviet prox^aganda in the Army continues to cause anxiety.

(Diary for May, paragraph 21) ended in a blaze of glory in Eastern Azerbaijan (Ardet.il and Aetara) on June 7th. Its success was such that pro-3oviet propagandists were dismayed, and they endeavoured, by means of rumours to the effect that, at one place and another, attempts had been made against the pe rson of His Majesty, to throw the populace into a state of alam. Phey were unsuccessful in their efforts - their statements were authoritatively denied - and the agitators withdrew, discomfited, for the rest of the month. The full list of the Shah’s gifts to Azerbaijan has now been published and there is hardly a town of any size which has not received appreciable grants for hospitals and schools, while the larger centres are also to benefit by measures to increase the water supply and by sports grounds and gymnasia. 26&gt; But in the midst of the widespread rejoicing, the military authorities received an unpleasant shock at the realisa- -tlon that the 'Barzani headache' (April Diary, paragraph 17) was once more upon them. It seemed that Mulla Mustafa, with several hundred fighting men, had returned to Persia via furkey 1 ‘tout May 51st. The Mulla reouested asylum and was informed by the Persians that he must surrender unconditionally. This did not at all accord with the Mulla's ideas of what was right and proper in the circumstances, and he started to move northward from the MEHOAWAR-TEHGA’ffAH district, generally by night. It was supposed by the Persian army, that Mulla Mustafa either wanted to join up with the Jelali tribe (in Uaku district) amongst whom Soviet influence was believed to be strong, or to escape to Russia. The army consequently decided to block his way, and Generals Shahbakhti from Tabriz, and Hamayuni and Zanguineh from Rezaleh went off, as soon as they were freed from their duties of attendance upon the Shah, to the scene of Operations. /Surely.•••EXT Surely a flattering array of strategists to deal wXtTTa Kurdish rebel and a few hundred tribesmen. _ About the 8th. June there was a brush between the Barzanis and the Persian troops in the mountains west of Khoi and Maku, which resulted in the former retreating to the north of Maku. Persian troops followed them up while others from the east and west endeavoured to seal off the Mulla’s northern path. A further brush ensued, and this time the Barzanis decided that further dallying on Persian soil might be disastrous. They abandoned such equipment as was burdensome and crossed the River Araxes into Russia about June 17th. It is believed that those who escaped in this fashion numbered between six and seven hundred. Thus, for the time being, ends the tale of Mulla Mustafa. Some of the Persian officers have found a M face-saving” formula by claiming that they M chased him out of Persia” - the fact is, however, that they failed in their task, although this task, it must be said in all fairness, was far from easy. Mulla Mustafa is a superb tactician. It will be interest- -ing to see what form his future activities will take. Meanwhile the Persians have protested to the appropriate Soviet frontier authority and to the Russian Consul at Maku for the 'facilities” which these are said to have made available to the Barzanis. It would seem that the Jelalis gave little, if any, military help to Mulla Mustafa, although it is certain that they did nothing to hinder his progress. They were probably intimidated by the overwhelming number of Persian soldiery in their area, and btaff Headauarters in Tabriz claims that they have now been disarmed, as well as the Qutur and Shikkak tribes. As a precaution however, military search parties are looking for conceales arms. Incidentally the success which has attended the efforts of the military authorities to secure disarmament of the population in the various towns is by no means completed, and it is suspected that there are still considerable 'caches” of rifles and ammunition. /Military,-3- Military Governors have the instructed to do what they can to unearth these. 27. Critics of the Government have been pointing out the ^slow rate of progress in the work of reconstruction and the Governor General himself has expressed to me his impatience with the Central Government which w thinks too much of politics and not enough of economics’ 1 . He has not spared himself nor his subordinates, and there seems little doubt that he has taken full advantage of every opportunity to improve the general welfare, and to reduce unemployment. As a measure of the esteem with which he is regarded I may mention the fact that he has just been elected to membership of the Society and Municipal Council of Tabriz — in other words he has been made an ’’Azerbaijani”, an honour bestowed for the first time. 28* Among the other main events of the month, the following may be mentioned: (a) The Director of Labour and Propaganda announced that work on the Tabriz - Maragheh stretch of the Mianeh - Tabriz railway had begun, and that unemployed persons might apply for work on this undertaking. Agricultural workers were expressly forbidden to leave their employment in favour of railway work. (b) Initial steps have been taken to erect now public buildings in Tabriz, some credits having already been allotted. (c) The irrigation company (Abyari) mentioned amongst the H Miscellaneous Items” in Tabriz Diary for May is not yet in being, as the public are unwilling to subscribe to any long-term venture. The Governor General thus finds himself frustrated both by the Central Government from which credits come all too slowly and by the monied classes of Azerbaijan who betray nervousness and pessimism as to the future. (d) Work on the asphalting of certain streets in Tabriz has begun. This sign of civilisation is welcome - but costly - and beyond giving employment to a number of workers, it benefits the masses not at all. There are more pressing needs, such as poor /relief (Sr\ relief and agricultural -4- credits for small fame (e) A varying amount of damage has 'been done to fruit crops in the province 'by late frosts, hail and woms« The harvest of Areals is, however, highly satisfactory. Preparations have been made to collect 60-70,000 tons of wheat as a reserve stock. (f) It is proposed to drain the swamps of Sharafkhaneh (eastern shore of Lake Urumieh), Khoi and Maku, which are breeding grounds for mosauitoes. (g) Disease amongst sheep in Savalan (Eastern Azerbaijan) and Maragheh districts has been causing damage and officials have been sent to inoculate flocks. (h) The work of locust destruction in Moghan area (May Diary - w Miscellaneous Items ,, ) has now been completed. The Persians allege however that about 150 hectares in adjoining Russian territory are infested with hoppers. (i) Plans are under way for the establishment of an agricultural college in Rezaieh to provide instruction for Kurdish tribes and other persons interested. A cattle breeding station will also be set up there, and another in Sarab. (j) Hitherto uncultivated land in the Moghan area is now to be developed. The Government has sent tractors, credit will be given to farmers, and these will repay in kind when harvests are collected. (k) A good impression has been caused by the presentation, by the British Council, of over 300 English books to the Tabriz Library. (l) Trade has been only moderate during the month. Russian piece goods prices have gone up as it is not known when the next consignment of supplies will come. (m) All persons in Azerbaijan and Khamseh who were condemned by Courts Martial since December 13th., 1946, have haa ^heir sentences reduced by ’'one degree”, by Royal Decree. (n) There is a strong and widespread feeling in Azerbaijan in favour of the early Coronation of the Shah. (o) Elections began in Rezaieh on June 21st., the two /oahdidates-5- candidetes being Mahoirmed Said (formerly Prime Mir Afer) and Sadighi Afshar. It is said that Sadighi Afshar, who was deputy for Rezaleh in the last Parliament and may en^oy the patronage of the Prxme Minister, hopes to bribe his way to success although popular feeling favours his opponent. Elections are still to be held in Maragheh, Mahabad, Ardebil and Ahar. (p) His Majesty’s Ambassador, Sir John Le Rougetel, K.C.M.G., M.C., visited Tabriz, Marand, Khoi, Shahpur, Rezaieh, M ahabad and Maragheh between June 27th. and June 50th. 29. The internal political outlook remains healthy and Russian propaganda efforts are ignored. All classes with the exception of a few timorous capitalists, are bending their energies towards an improvement of their own and the general we3fare. But the closest cooperation from the Central Government is still a prime necessity as the people can not of themselves restore the position to nomal. Such Government aid as has been granted so far is helping to absorb some of the unemployed in the towns - there is temporary work for the agricultural labourers with the harvests - but utter poverty is widespread and measures to relieve this roust be taken before the onset of winter if political as well as physical disease is to be avoided. The farm workers can count upon securing employment for the five summer months - they can live on their daily wage; but the reserve which they can build up in cash or kind is negligible; and such reserves as they had before the events of 1946 have gone. What is to happen to them during the other seven months? These people form the bulk of the population. (sd) W.

The population is not, however, impressed by ideas, and they are waiting, with some impatience, for the Central Govern ment to get on with the Job. In most denartmmtr the people meet with the response #efter the Hew Year* O f arch 21st) When they ask as to when practical developments may be expected. The disarming of the population, itfiich from the first was recognised as a difficult task, has made little real progress, and the Officer Command ing in Azerbaijan has found himself obliged to postpone the *final date of surrender of arms to ^arch 2let. on the 26th. February he summoned the Armenian Bishop in Tabriz and warned him that his flock must comply with the order to surrender arras without further delay. In the absence of a really forceful system of house to house search it is doubtful if any more than about 10&amp; of the wear on* and ammunition will be given up, and the percentage amongst the Kurd? may be even lower. 8. There were apparently strong runours In T ehren early in the month of army excesses in Azerbaijan. . Hikpay, of the Prime AMnister , s office, not only believed them but expressed some alarm to H*It.

K. Nikpay was accompanied during his visit to IWbriz by Aramesh, the principal reason for the visit of the latter being to find out the prospects for the establishment of the Iran democrat Party in Azerbaijan. I said in one of my earlier reports (November liary, paragraph 154) / that- 2 - Qb&gt; that the Azerbaijan ’Jeraocrat leadei^ fear a a that the Iran democrat Party might a ween Azerbaijan with noteworthy aucceas. Xt c$wj.a have done so - but the day* for that have parsed. The attitude of Prime Minister Qavam is not understood locally. The pee^le feel that Azerbaijan Is surely one of the brightest y If not the bright est, jewel in the - erslar crovm. The Inhabitants hove proved thetreelvo* loy al and patriotic Persians. The return of Azerbaijan to the Central Government fold has been of world-wide interest, yet the Prime minister has not seen fit to come to Tabriz and shake the hand? of a few of the people whom he has praised through this and that mouthpiece. Had he come and shown himself up to say January 15th (i»e* a month after the entry of Persian troops) he would have received a warm, nay a rousing welcome. His party would have been greeted with equal enthusiasm and his personal triunph would have been com- plate. But he failed to come - pressure of wot*:? - bad health? - fear of Russian reaction? - the Azerbaijanis laugh contesmntuously and, for the present at any rate, wipe him and his party off their political slate. They will choose their own candidates - men who can be trusted to do nore for Azerbaijan than make pretty speeches - and impressive plans on paper. Tehran will be made to realise that Azerbaijan is ftally conscious of its own worth - that it is the rich uncle, not the poor relation - and it will not hesitate, if it is forced to do so thropgh a lack of acumen of the Cent ral Government, to look for some patriotic and us 1 in*.minded Pore Ian (quali ties conspicuously absent in Plshevari) to lead it on towards Its own concep tion of its destiny. It seesos to be generally accepted that beyyid &gt;ia, at present a political prisoner in Tehran, would receive considerable support In A^erbal^ jan were he free. Two other names are also mentioned - Tzqi aadeh (Ambassa dor in London) and Hussein Ala (Ambassador In ashington). Ihere are some hundred would-be candidates for the nine places allotted to Tabriz in the elections - but the people will be chary of accepting as deputies imposing nonentities frorn Tehran. They have been stung before. A Supervisory Committee for the elections was set up on Feb ruary 26th, it being conposed mainly of merchants, men free of any suspicion of pr&lt;v hissian or pro- A 2&lt; nphaijan &gt;emocrats synpathiee . 1C, Russian prestige in Azerbaijan remains low, and the Humeian school . in Tabriz , tfiich had over 500 pupils, was closed on February ^7th without - / notice _Tap ■■■■■■Hi- 3 - notice* Hie Soviet Hospital is almost empty (previously it ha&lt;5 heavy flemanap on it), and there was only a sprinkling of the non-official element at the 29th anniversary of ^ed Army nay held in the VOT (Soviet Cultural Society) building, a fact which was widely noticed. The Russian gr^ture in handinfr bac , at Julfa and /iatara, some lorries and motor vehicles tak^ft away by the fleeing Democrats, aroused little interest in Tabriz.

These in cluded* (a) the adequate punishment of Azerbaijan Democrat leaders, (b) tbe re-establishment of security all over the province and the disarming of all persons not authorised to carry arms or to possess ammunition, (c) tbe appointment of capable and honest officials. ( d) a sound educational oropramme which would include religious inst ruction, (e) commercial and agricultural credits on long term and at reason able rates of interest, (f) organisation of agriculture and public health, (g) cleaning up of the ’department of Justice and a speedy settlement of outstanding cases, (h) general reconstruction* iis^rovement of the water supply in Tabriz as well as of the electricity and telephone services; repair of streets and roads, ( i) extension of the railway from ttlaneh to Tabriz, thus connecting Tehran with Tabriz and the north and facilitating trade. The new Governor-General, All ! ansur, arrived on Januarv Sth and on 2 January 7th he announced the Central Government’s programme for the p’enerel improvement of conditions in Azerbaijan. This took fhl! cognisance of the points set out above and tbe people voiced their satisfaction. They are / howeverhowever fUlly determined to ensure that the political storm of the past few months will be replaced by the fair winds of a progressive and construct ive Government policy and not by the doldrums of inefficiency i&amp;nd starnation which they exnerienced under the Central Government in the past. The Governor-General and his officials are being prodded persistently by all * sections of the community to 'get on with it' and are being given no rest. At the same time a 'whispering campaign' has been initiated by opponents of the prime Minister to the effect that he is abrogating all power to himself, that 'nothing is being done' in Azerbaijan, that there is a lamentable lack of security and that bribery and corruption are already in evidence. 3. I have had several talks with pimiya, with All ^ansur, with the General Commanding the Azerbaijan Division (Zarrebi) who took over from General Hachimi on January 1st, and with the civil governor of Tabriz. These Officials, especially pimiya, have studied the position in the province carefully and they have sound ideas as to what is to be done and how it is to be done. A change of r%ime, such as Azerbaijan has just exnerienced, implies, necessarily, all the delay and confusion of re-adjustment, and the bulk of the peonle are willing to concede to the Government a reasonable period within which to prove their sincerity and capabilities. It is fully realised that a netum to normal ard the holding of elections cannot be exnact ed until the Government is master in its own house, and the disarming of the peasantry (who like to keen a rifle because 'it makes them feel safe') and of the Kurds in astern Azerbaijan is no easy task. 4. Meanwhile let us see, in brief, what has been done during January. This may be summarised as follows* (a) a combing out of unreliable elements in Government office was begun with a view to establishing public confidence in the integrity of the state officials, (b) a charitable committee has been appointed, under the auspices of the 'Hm and ^ed Lion' to collect funds for the poor* and provision has already beep made for the support of S5 r destitute persons in Tabriz. i (c) Arrangements have been made to extend, shortly, loans to landowners and factory owners. ( d) The Ministry of Agriculture is taking steps to secure agricultural / machineryfor farmers. i (e) 'flie Kinietr'/’ of ^&lt;!ucation is drawinpr ut&gt; sn educational nroeframme ^or the province* the university of Tabriz is to be put on a proper foot ing (with a faculty of medicine fully equipped), and Inspectors have been sent to Khoi, ^hahpur, ^aku and arand to examine the educational ^ requirements of these areas, (f) The Agricultural Bank has five million Hials for credits as wall as the cash which was left in deposit by the Azerbaijan Bemocrats. (g) Work on the Tabriz water supply hag begun. 5. If the Azerbaijan Democrats were unable to ^deliver the goods’ 1 they could always be relied upon to put up a fairly convincing facade. Tehran should not dismiss the facade with contempt; it has a definite political advantage - the masses do not look too closely at the H bird in the hand” las long as it makes a noise like a bird. There is much to be done. Casual labour clutters up the pavements of Tabriz main street while the Oovemmont talk vaguely of public worses in the spring to relieve unemployment. *Tn the sprint” is not soon enough for a hungry man - and his family; and in all truth there is enough work in the cleaning up of Tabriz streets and in fill ing in holes or bridging waterways in public thoroughfares to keep all the casual labour busy during these trying winter months. The wages for such purposes may not be an investment of itaneejiste economic worth - but the political value that accrues is worthy of every consideration. Property questions in regard to confiscations made by the Azerbaijan Democrats remain to be settled, a committee has been formed to study the matter. Plans for the reconstruction, within two years, of the Tianeh-Tabriz railway are under way and part of the terrain, via laragheh, has alreacty been prepared.* # Commercial circles also need financial facilities to enable them to import and export without the delays and difficulties of constant reference to Tehran. Mention may also be made of the need for adequate gendarmerie to en- sure law and order everywhere. Hany persons have been done to death in Hezaieh district (Christians among them) for their association with the / ^zerba ijan4 a. Azerbaijan democrats, by uncontrolled mobs, 6 .

Dr, Hbal, Minister of Health, arrived in -szerbaijan to inspect public health organisation. New Govern or-General All Mansur arrived with new Governor of Tabriz Mumtaz- Governor-General announced programme of reforms for Azerbaijan. Pimiya and Iqbal left for Hezaieh. It was announced that sugar, tea and piece goods would be sold at controlled prices shortly. Curfew in Tabriz made from 10 instead of 9. Arrests of former Democrats proceeding - in villages leaders and secretaries of Democrat societies being examined. Armenian Bishop and leading Armenians assured the Governor-General that Armenians had no weapons and were always law-abiding citizens. Garrisons under lieutenant-colonels have now been established at Astara, Julfa, Ahar (Khuda Afrin) and Aranlar (near T^aku). Iqbal returned from Western Azerbaijan and left for Tehran. It was learned that in Khoi pimiya asked landowners to cooperate with the peasants and said that the Agricultural Bank would help them with long term loans for reconstruction work. Gendarmerie established at ftozaleh, Khoi, Miku, Iferand, Sarah, Ardebil and Astara. 'Whispering campaign ’ against Central Government evident in Tabriz.

It will be remembered that November closed with the Provincial Council in Tabriz telegraphing to the Prime Minister to the effect that no Central Government troops were needed for security in Azerbaijan during the elections, and that should these come disorder would, without a doubt, ensue# The Prime Minister, replying on Pec^mber 1st, said that the Council was not i competent to decide vibether or not the troops should come. This was a matter for the Central Government and the Azerbaijan Democrats need be under no illusion* a force would be sent and the Provincial Government would be res ponsible for the consequences if they tried to bar the way. jf 161. The fear which had been chilling the hearts of Pishevari and his colleagues increased. Clearly the situation was desperate. They had no adequate force of well-trained soldiers to hurl against the Persian army and the Azerbaijan Fidais and conscripts were read/ to throw in their hands at the first determined opposition they encountered, for they had come to the conclusion that the *150 million people behind them' 1 (October Diary, para graph 149) were too far behind. 1 The Azerbaijan Democrats saw that military aid from Pussia, in so far as soldiery was concerned, was apparently not to be expected. True, quantities of rifles and ammunition were coming through nightly from that country by truck, but what the Democrats sorely needed were a few thousand soldiers who were prepared to fight. In a last desperate effort to save himself, Pishevari freely handed out to anybo&lt;fy who would take them the wea pons which Moscow supplied. These were taken up with alacrity by all and sundry to be used not for the purpose of protecting the Party leaders but for their own purposes as soon as the Democrat organisation had broken down. 168. Cn December 4th Pishevari announced that Central Government troops had already 'invaded* Azerbaijan and attacked the Democrat forces, but this report was false and was promptly denied by the Prime Minister. Meanwhile preparations for the elections in the Province were initiated, hut on Decem ber 8th the Governor-General received a telegram from the Prime Minister instructing him to await the arrival of the security troops. A supervisory / committee'oamitteefor the elections was nevertheless formed in Tabriz,) cons is ting of nine persons, members of the party or individualsj dafin^ely sympathetic towards it, and they set about preliminary arrangements for the appointment of sub-conaiittees although they decided rt to keep within the laW* by taking ^10 active steps until the Prime Minister authorised the holding of elections In other parts of Persia. 163. vatters came to a head on December 9th when the Oovemor-Ceneral received a telegram from the Prime Minister saying that Central Ooverronent troops in Zenjan had been ordered to proceed into Azerbaijan to keep order during the elections and that if thev were resisted they would heat down all opposition, panic seized upon the democrat Party especially when the news from the front confirmed their worst fears, namely that the Azerbaijan forces were deserting wholesale. The Party leaders made preparations for flight while the citizens of Tabriz eagerly awaited the arrival of the Tehran troops By the morning of December 11th Fishevari and many other prominent democrats had disappeared from the scene. Hie Governor-General and Ghabiatary (Presi dent of the provincial Council) remained, however, and telegraphed to the toah and to the Prime Minister that a special meeting of the Council had decided to withdraw all opposition to the entry into th* T 'rovince of the Central Government forces, to avoid useless bloodshed and to remove the mis understandings between Tabriz and Tehran. Biriya, Chatman of the Trades Unions Council, who had also stayed behind, announced this to the citizens of Tabriz later in the day. JL64. While this news afforded the greatest satisfaction to the people, they realised that only the speedv entry of the Persian forces into Tabriz were would check the lawlessness and disorder which / the inevitable result of the disappearance of all responsible authority. The Governor-General, who was heartily disliked on account of his pro-Russian sympathies, made an appeal for the maintenance of order and organised a new security police. Hie efforts, however, brought little result. Arms and ammunition were in the possession of, or available to, anybody who cared to pick theu. up, even mere boys, and the supplies of these were augmented by deserting aids is and cons cripts who abandoned them at the first opportunity. Vengeance against any democrats who could be unearthed became the order of the day - and night. / These- 3 - . 1*1 ese were shot and their houses and shops wredced* F^oin th^ night of Deceirv- her 11th a continuous barrage of rifle fire was kept lip* all over the city by .the GlOvemor-General , s new police who were endeavouring to bolster up their courageby firing frequently, by roaming bands seeking their Democrat Party ^rey, and by 'uhajjirs who had erected strongpoints in various parts of the town and were defending themselves with grim desperation. Meanwhile many Democrats had succeeded in making their escape to Russian territory. I learned from the Customs Officer at JUlfa that 90 trucks, 36 jeeps, 12 buses and 20 cars had passed over the frontier with some 600 Democrats. 165. The position in Tabriz remained unpleasant; security did not exist and again and again the people asked in their anxiety what was delaying the Central Government forces. 'The citizens feared that the uhajjire might manufacture an incident” which would be used as a pretext for active tfussian intervention »‘to protect soviet interests’ 1 . ?rom a military point of view there was no need for the Central Government troops to holdback, as their advance guard could easily have noted the utter demoralisation of the Democrat soldiers. When the Central Government* troops did arrive in the evening of December 13th, the welcome with which they were received was heartfelt as their presence swept away almost completely the tension of the preceding days. t The military conroander, General Hachimi, declared martial law and imposed a curfew. A military governor was appointed and a beginning was made with the work of reducing the principal strong points of the Mhhajjirs. By the after noon of December 14th order had been restored to a noteworthy degree. At the same time, the Persian units had been proceeding to the occupation of other towns and villages including the Kurdish Democrat centre of ?,*ahabad. 166. The Prime Minister’s deputy, Pimiya, and some other officials, arrived from Tehran on the 21st December to stu&lt;ty the general position and in * Pirniye the course oi visits to Tabriz factories esdiorted the workers to carry on as '’they would be well looked after”. News of the appointment of Ali ^iansur as Governor-General of Azerbaijan was favourably received in the province as it was felt that he would pursue an energetic and realistic policy. Tfte military government in Tabriz liberated all persons who had been cast into prison by the Democrats for political reasons, and they / succeeded' S T' - 4 - cyx s ..cceeded in rounding i^p about five hundred i^emocra ta: f S e The political ante cedents of these were examined by a commission composed of^Local personalities. Some two hundred of them were released and people murmured of bribery. As a protest against these releases the merchants closed the bazaar on December VBtlr ^edging conplaints not only against the commission but also against the Tehran police officials who had been sent up and whosw interrrity was oner to serious doubt. The pe&lt;fc&gt;le were insistent on adequate punishment for democrats, and no return to the bribery a nd corruption of the old days under the Central Government regime. General Hachiml recognised the need for satisfying the populace in these legitimate demands and he suspended releases of Democrats and promised an immediate investigation of the conduct of the police. The merchants threatened to close the bazaar again if they did not receive early satisfaction, 168. Heza Shafaq, Hector of Tehran University and Azerbaijani by birth, declared in Tabriz on December :38th that the Central Government were preparing measures for the inprovement of conditions in the province but that these would take some time to put into effect, and he asked landowners and peasants, factory owners and workers, to show mutual understanding and practical sympa thy. 169, General nachimi told me on December 29th that it was proving to be exceedingly difficult to capture all the Democrats who were still in hiding in Tabriz and whom he estimated at about one thousand. In this connection he firmly believed that the T^ussian Consulate was engaged in undesirable acti vities, although he was unable to give definite proof of this. It was the Hussian object, he said, to endeavour to get him into trouble and to get rid of him as an 'anti-Soviet' by bringing up numerous complaints of molestation of Russian citizens and attacks on Russian property. Hiese complaints were for the most part without real justification. He expected that the disarming of the population, especially in the country districts, would take some con siderable time. 1?Q« It is clear that the Azerbaijanis are looking expectantly to the Central Government to give them security and fair treatment economically. Any return to the former conditions under the Central Gove r Timent, where bribery, corruption and oppression were prominent features, will be fatal, and the / peqole5 - 6 - .i ! f&gt; pdoplo havo not been slow to seize upon the alleged lack of integrity of the new police Officers* These must be replaced and a strong and public warning from the Prime minister that any dishonesty towards, or oppression of, the populace by state officials will meet with severe punishment, would have a tracing effect.

General. I said In ajy Diary for September CpfiLra£re(B&gt; 131) that the Azerbaijan Democrats were In no way conciliatory In spirit towards the JJentral Government. That mood seems to have communicated itself to the latter and the month of November has been characterised by intransigence on both sides. The Prime minister during the weeks of negotiation, from Auguat until October, with the Tabriz Delegation, appears to have dene his best to strike a balance between the legitimate aspirations of Azer baijan and the right of the Central Government to exercise due control over the province. Ihe Azerbaijan Democrat leaders, however, imbued as they were with the determination to preserve their power in Azerbaijan, irritated the Prime Minister beyond endurance and at the end of October he offered them an agreement on a M take it or leave it H basis. At the same, time he announced his intention of sending Central Government forces into Azerbaijan before the elections for the purpose of supervising these. Ibis announcement aroused both the fury and the alarm of the Democrats. Ihe Persian troops might influence the electorate to the disadvantage of the Democrats, and it might he the Prime minister's intention to set up, under the protection of his troops, branches of the Iran Democrat Party to run in boposition to the Azerbaijan Democrats and sweep them off the board. Ihe Azerbaijan Democrats reacted inroediately and sent soldiers and equip ment post haste to 2enjsn to stop the advance north of Central Government forces. They declared that they would have no further truck with the Prime Minister and his party and accordingly they seized with alacrity the opport unity offered to them to join the coalition of the other Leftist parties in Persia, further, they proceeded to muster all the men and to collect all the money which they could lay their hands on, exacting tribute of both from every village. 155» The Govemois-General, Dr. Javid, returned from Tehran on November 6th. and the Party immediately embarked on long discussions of the agree ment which the Prime Minister had offered* Finally, at Russian instigation, they decided to announce their acceptance og it and this was done in the Tabriz newspaper *Azad Millat' of November 11th. The Party leaders, however, / maintained- 2 - maintained the greeteat secrecy as to the nature of the afr^eemont and ^ j/ 1 ^ pishevari expressed his regret to we that he could not divulpe any of its clauses, T learned unofficially, however, that it included the following points* Ihe control of ^enjan was to return to the Central Government and the Azerbaijan troops there were to be withdrawn. In return for this the the Azerbaijanis were to be allowed to occupy ^ardasht. (b) Ihe garrison at Zenjan was to consist of 300 gendarmerie from Tehran and 300 chosen by Tabriz,the whole to be comnanded ty an officer appointed by the Central Government, (c) The army in Azerbaijan was to consist of 10,000 men, all of thim local conscripts under the command of a general nominated by Tehran, while the existing ^idais were to provide a gendarmerie of 4,000 and the remainder were to be disbanded. (d) All land expropriated was to be returned to the former owners except that purchased by private individuals during the reign of Peza Shah: the^e individuals were to receive compensation. About the middle of the month, the Democrats bef^an their withdrawal from zenjan. They felt that if the leftist parties won the elections the Azerbaijanis could easily reoccupy the town in which they claimed to have many supporters, and if the elections went against them, they could always resort to arms again to bring Tehran to book. On November 20th., while complaining bitterly of fhe rising tide of reactionary activities in Tehran, pishevari said that the Party had agreed to withdraw their forces from Zenjan, firstly to avoid bloodshed and second ly to give the lie to reactionary allegations that it was the aim of the Azerbaijan Democrats to separate Azerbaijan from the rest of Persia. In his fblminations against the reactionaries he admitted that as a result of their intrigues they might get a majority in the forthcoming elections due to the fact that foreign elements were in control of the situation in the south, the Azerbaijan Democrat Movement, however, could not be crushed. 156. The Democrats* withdrawal from Zenjan was only partial and on November 23rd. on instructions from the prime Minister Central Government troops occupied the town, where the gideis had been making themselves objectionable to those members of the populace who were not sympathetic to-ards them, on the same day the Zenjan supporters of the AzerbaijanDemocrats telegraphed for help to Tabriz, saying thar they were being attacked by some 5,000 •♦adventurers*’ (in reality the dnraged townspeople) and that the Democrat 'Sieikh Ali A1 Ishag from Khoi had been*trilled. Tabriz press and radio protested bitterly at the treatment accorded to 7 ^.^ir surroorters in Zenjan but the Party made no attempt to relieve their distress in spite of earlier faithftl promises that they would never forget them. At a press conference on November 34th. pishevari said that the Central Government anparently did not want a peaceful settlement of the Zen,)an question as »»they had broken their undertaking not to send troops to the town. If the Central Government wanted an armed struggle then Azer baijan would fight to the last taan rt . At this juncture the Govern or-General received a telegram from the prime minister in which the latter repeated his earlier statement that troops would be sent into Azerbaijan as into the other provinces of Persia, to supervise the elections, together with a commission duly appointed for the purpose. SUrther, the prime Minister instructed him to take steps for the elections to be held between December 7th. and December 21st. fallow ing upon this, pishevari in a press article on November 25th. said that Azerbaijan •♦was not on its knees and would not accept the dishonour of Central Government troops coming to the Province. The Prime minister did not understand the strength of the Democrat movement and his reactionary policy would result in much bloodshed as the Democrat forces would smash the armed intruders and force them hack’*. Accordingly the Party closed the road from Tabriz to Tehran, sent reinforcements to Mianeh to which the Zenjan contingent had withdrawn and proceeded to round up and to arm all the forces which remained uncollected. 'The police were instructed not to allow the public to pick up any propaganda material that might be dropped from Central Government aircraft. Iffi• there is no doubt that the Democrat leaders were in a very nervous state and their fears spread to the rank and file of the Party. the temper of the people was uncertain and the loyalty of the conscripted troops and even of the Pidais was doubtful. Hitherto Pishevari and his associates had always counted upon Russian intervention on their behalf, should pressure from the Central Government become too great. That many / sections4 sections of the population would eagerly avail themselves of an opportunity to join an opposition party, preferably the Iran Democrats, was tolerably certain and the consequences of even a minor military defeat inflicted on the Azerbaijan Democrat forces were likely to be widespread throughout the Ptovince. It was therefore with a considerable feeling of relief that they received a visit from a foviet Official from Tehran on November 25th. The latter returned to Tehran on the following day, came back on the 2^th. and • left again for the capital on November 2^th. I have been unable to ascertain what transnired during these visits. There was a rumour to the effect that the Russians instructed the Democrats not to resist Central Government troops but I cannot confirm this. Certainly pishevari has made no more violent speech* as, but on the other hand the vituperation against the Central Government in the Tabriz press and radio has reuiained uncnecked, and there has been no slack ening in the Democrats* military preparations. There was general resentment amongst the commercial and landowner classes at the 'Kussian lntervention’‘ as they felt that but for this the prime minister would have had no difficulty in j securing control of the Province. 158, Meanwhile the Govern or-General caused a notice to be inserted in the press to the effect that the elections would be held between December 7th. and December 71st. and that they would be free and democratic and that the arty comaittees concerned were to take th*» necessary steps. Cn November 2Pth. he left for Mahabad to see the Kurdish Democrat leader, &lt;tezi Mohammed, and on . November 30th. it was reported that Democrat forces, together with Kurdish sympathisers from M&amp;habad district, had been concentrated north of Gar dash t and saqqiz to check any Central Government advance from these places. Iffi ? lha month closed, as it had begun, with both the Central Government and the aizerbaijan Democrats firm on the question of the entry of Persian troqps into the province. The provincial Council of Azerbaijan telegraphed on the last day of the month to the prime Minister saying that no troops were needed for security during the elections in Azerbaijan as there were already sufficient forces in the Province to maintain order, and in any case these forces were part of the Persian Amy under the terms of the agreement of June 1946 with the Central Government. In the absence of Tehran soldiery, there / wouldwould be free and peaceful elections. Should these come f disorder would doubtless break out. The Democrats, as a concession, would be willing how ever to allow the Supervisory Comnission vhich the Prime Finister had men tioned, or r^resentatives of the press, to inspect the election machinery v.id satisfy themselves that all was as it should be.

The bePrlnnlnirr of theVfriftih founfl the Azerbai^ai Democrat I 7 Party decidedly su epic ions as to the intention a o f a Ce ntra 1 Govern ment in regard to Azerbaijan. No nevrs had come throupft of any real pro gresa being made by the delegation in Tehran, and the Central Govern ment were showing unexpectedly strong resistance to the H legitimate demands' of the party. The trouble in the south did nothing to allay the Democrats* fears that all was not well, althou^i pishevari, Chair man of the Central Committee of the party, did his beat to bolster them up by saying, on October 2nd* that the enemies of freedom in the south would soon be crushed. On October 7th a telegram was received at Party Headquarters to the effect that agreement had at last been reached with the Central Government, and also that preparations for the elections could be made, ihe Democrats reacted iimnediately, and embarked on a campaign of elect ion propaganda designed to convince the electorate that the candidates put forward by the party (the only candidates allowed to stand) were those beat fitted to farther the interests of the people in the new I-rajlis. Ihe party acquired the heat hotel in Tabriz, the ^erdowsi, at a cost of 200,OOO tomans, and then set about imposing levies on local merchants so as to pay for it, at least in part. In accordance with Article 11 of the Agreement of 13th June, 1946, between Azerbaijan and the Central Government, a Supreme Council was set up on October 8th conposed of the Presidential Committee of the provineial Council, and the heads of all Government departments, under the Chairmanship of pishevari. addressing the Counoil, pishevari com plained of serious inefficiency in Government departments, ibis was g probably a pretext for the dismissal of those elements suspected of beir too friendly to the Central Government. It was reported in Tabriz on October 9th that the delegation in Tehran was coming back almost immediately, and that rergian troops for garrison duty on the Russian and TXirkish frontiers in Azerbaijan / underunder General Ali Alavi ^pghadarn would also leave the capital in a short time. This news was received in party circlea with dismay. Persian troops on Azerbaijan soil might well be expected to weaken the influence of the Democrat Party over the Azerbaijan electorate. 146^^ Meanwhile the party was fhced with dissension in its ranks. T&amp;e heads of the departments of pollce y transport and finance* accused pishe^ri of being too complaisant towards the Central Government as he had allowed the negotiations in Tehran to drag on too long* and they threatened to take action against him* probably at the instigation of the Russians. Pishevari said he would resign if they were not satis fied with him, but they decided to defer action until the delegates returned from Tehran. 147. on October 13th the delegatee, with the exception of Javld, the Governor-General, arrived in Tabriz* and the populace waited expect antly for an official announcement of the success which had attended their negotiations. The days passed* but no announcement ca»e # The deputies were uncommunicative and moody* and it soon became evident that they had no successes of which they could boast. Javid* it was said* was arranging a credit for the elections and would return later. 143. within a week of the return of the delegates the Democrat Party decided that they could expect nothing from the Central Govern ment or from the Tran Democrat party and that if they and the Tudeh did not get a arajority in the elections they would declare Azerbaijan independent. Farther it was agreed that the entry of Persian garrison troops into Azerbaijan before the elections must be prevented and accordingly they started to give the pida*is Intensive military train ing and to send reinforcements south to Kianeh and Zenjan, General D»nishiyan superintending the movements. The pay of the Fida 1 is was raised from 300 Rials per month to 900* and some 200 tommy guns* recent ly received from the Hussions, were handed over to the troops. The Democrats obliged all workers to pay one toman towards the support of the 'cause. / 149. In these149, In these cicuTnetanees, the ShaVs birthttey *-109 Ignored In Tabrl* except by the two British concerns, the Imperial Banfr and the A,I,C,C. Party leaders said that no matter what the Central Government mi#it now propose the Democrats would have no truck with them, and Pishevari warned the members that H danger threatened Azerbaijan and that they must be rea&lt;ty for instant action*. Hestaurant and cafe proprietors were instructed not to tune in Tehran radio, and conscripts were rounded up and sent southwards to join the Fida^s with the injunction th a t ’‘they should have no fear as they had ISO million people behind them*. 150. Towards the end of the month Javid telegraphed to the effect that he had secured a credit of about 62*000 tomans for the elections. Ihe month closed with a report that tavern had telegraphed to &lt;fiabistary (President of the Provincial Council) saying that a new agreement with Azerbaijan was reader for signature and that if the Democrats were not disposed to accept it, there would be no further negotiations. 151. restlessness amongst the tribes caused the Azerbaijan Provincial Government early in the month to make an arrangement with azi ifdhamed wheretyr the revenue accruing from Khol, 3bahpur, rezaieh, and Ifiandbab would be equally divided in return for peace and quiet in the districts concerned. A number of Kurds were accordingly Installed in Government of f ic es. ^mmar Khan, who was at the head of a ffcirly strong Kurdish movement which was quite independent of azi Mohamed, was urged on October 11th to accept another arrangement whmreby (a) The Aaerbaijan Government would pay to the Kurds the sum of three million ^ials annually to preserve order In Western Azerbaijan, and (b) The Government in the towns in Western Azerbaijan would remain in the hands of the Azerbaijan Government but that Kurdish representatives should work with them in the Govt, offices. 'This agreement had already been signed by 2ero Beg (the Kurdish Cownunist\, and by General nanishiyan on behalf of the Azerbaijan Govt. At K han, who had the dhikkak and ?fengur tribes solidly behind him, / refused4 refused as he wanted full control of Western Ururaioh, and he threatened to move north to Mku and east to Tehrand. Subsequently Amniar Khan took part In an arrangement which the ^serb^ijan provincial Government entered Into with the Rezaieh Kurds whereby some half dozen chiefs were bought off with a payment of 25 # 000 tomans each on a monthly basis* In addition to this the chiefs in Rezaieh district forcibly collected one fifth of all agricultural produce in their areas. a 152. On October 16th fighting between the Jelfcli Kurds and Fida'is at ’4aku was reported but this ended a few days later* It is noteworthy that In all the above Kurdish activities the ^Russian Vice-Consul at lezaieh has taken his place at the negotiations with the Azerbaijan provincial Government as mediator and adviser to both parties. It is believed that the Debukhri i^angur and Msmish tribes (Haha- bad district) as well as Ataaar Khan with his Shikkaks, would be only too glad to join Central Government troops against the Azerbaijan Democrats as they have a religious detestation of Gommunism. Ihey have been building up wheat supplies and Amniar Khan, who owed wheat to the Russians in return for arms and ammunition, has invited them to take their arms back as he cannot pay in wheat.

General, Azerbaijan Delegation ;«Hich J.eft for Tehran on August'^ Isfl^arrled with it the high?hcs&gt;^ Of the Azerbaijan Democrat party for a speedy and successful mission. Azerbaijan wished to r position fl as a Government raneetsjsg tne wiax^oj? Tin?? return to Tabriz of the 15,000,000 tomans owed by the National Bartfc,H ^ together with, if possible, a loan from the Central Government. The long protracted negotiations have left the Party disgruntled and suspi cious. The Chairidan of the Party Central Coranittee, M. pishavari, endeavoured in a recent speech to reassure the members by saying taat the Delegation had succeeded in obtaining a settlement of some of the points at issue, but he was compelled to admit that all was nox, v k &lt;ell and he attributed the delay, as is usual with soviet puppets, to the activities of ’’reactionaries *, who v/iahed to impede the spread to othej parts of Persia of the benefits which the Azerbaijan Democrats had been able to wrest for the province. 131. The Delegation left Tabriz in no spirit of conciliation nor were they imbued with any will to negotiate. Their object was to takib demands which the Central Government must accept. Their continue* stay in the capital and the absence of any hard news have given rise to the fear that the Prime Minister ie hoodwinking them. Certainly the Democrats have enough to embarrass them. Their financial position is desperate, Kurdish activities In Urumieh district are keeping them on tenterhooks, while forces of irregulars, equipped, say the Democrati by the Persian Authorities in ftesht, have been in conflict with the Fida^s in Ardebil. The Provincial Government scheme, for the collec* tion of grain for storage for winter needs is meeting with resistance from landowners and farmers alike, and tax defalcations keep the Government tills empty. The Russians are buying up cettle, sheep, and wheat, cheerfully Ignoring the official price control, the scarcity of bread is becoming more acute and the party has to contend with a populace of which 90% are either hostile or completely apathetic. Trade is stagnant, as people who have any money either hide it, or transfer it to Tehran for security. 7 .■ 132. The Democrats are, however, endeavouring to make the best of a bad job. They have urged a speeding up of the work of the Delegation in Tehran so that the delegates may return to Tabriz ’’where they are badly needed**. The party organisation is tireless in its efforts to enlist the active support of workers and peasantry and the political police are sufficiently diligent in the discharge of their duties to make it quite certain that no dissentia^ voice will be heard in the Province. When the elections do take place the country people will have been terrorised into voting for the Party whilst in the towns adequate inducement will have been offered to the factory workers to ensure their urtiola-heerted support. It is expected* however, that in^ Tabriz itself, a hi$i proportion of the inhabitants will absent them selves from the polls. Dissatisfaction with all that the present reg ime entails, is rampant, but with the Soviet shadow in the background, the people do not look for any change, r-sist nnd are cost into prison, some steer a middle course, trusting to the future to bring a solution to their problems and many, regarding the situation as being fraught with danger and insecurity for themselves, abandon t^eir properties and seek refuge in Tehran. 133. Clearly the outcome of the Delegation’s work in Tehran must be awaited before any further appreciation of the situation can be made, but obviously the Russians will not permit the provincial Government or rather the Democrat ^ arty to be seriously weakened, either by intrigue from Tehran or by purely local opposition. Under Russian j ^ j / tutelage n A qb2 - tutelage the Party have come to regard themselves as the bearers of ^ the torch of freedom, with a mission to fulfil not only in Azerbai jan but in the whole of Persia. Azerbaijan must be an exiranle to the rest of the country. Local propaganda against Britain and America and against the tribes in the south ! *who are the tools of reaction aries' is not enough. Hard political facts are required. 'frie “democratic Progress■* of the liberated'' people of Azerbaijan, freed ^ from the bonds of the feudalism of the past must stand out for the ^ edification of the other provinces. Consequently the present activities of the Kurds in the west and of the “Persian Irregulars” the east cannot be allowed to proceed unchecked. The wiet has no need to bring any pressure to bear on Azerbaijan by exposing it to the attacks of embarrassing elements. The Province is theirs, lock stock and barrel, and it seems reasonable to expect that Soviet influence will be brought to bear in Hesaiehj or in Tehran, or in both, as and when it seems to be required. 134* Democrat Part/ Affairs. A parade was held in Tabriz on SepteaSar 1 Jr3 to celebrate the first anniversary of the foundation of the party. The Chairman of the Central Committee, pishavari, availed himself or the occasion to say that the Party was prepared to cooperate with the Iran Party, which he called the Government party, and with any other political group which pursued democratic ideals consistently. He insisted that ail that the Democrat Party had so far achieved musw be given full legal sanction and he demanded 42 deputies for Azerbaijan in the new Parliament. 135. There has been no plenary session of the Provincial Council during September but the Party has been busy organising Trades unions with close personal support from pishavari and orchestral concerts, theatrical performances, sports facilities and night schools are a&amp;ongst the inducements offered to members, while a new Party school of Law and Politics for the sons and daughters of Party members was opened by pishavari on September 23rd. 136. To the course of a further speech which he made to a meeting of party members on September 24th pishavari said that the forces of reaction were strongly entrenched in the Central Govern ment, and the value of coalition with other political parties wss open to doubt, since, in spite of the uni^n of the Tudeh^ with the Iran T)emocrats, leaders of the former in several places had been imprisoned and their headquarters sacked. In addition the Provincial Government had documentary proof that the Central Government were behind the attacks on the fida'is at Ardebil. Ibis could hardly lead to confidence between Tabriz and Tehran and he asked the latter to put an end to such attacks. 137. Kurds. 'The activities of the Kurds in Urumieh district during the month have given the provincial Government cause for anxiety. It appears that some five hundred Kurdish soldiers have been in and around Rezaieh for the past few weeks, but there have been no reports of actual fighting although the Provincial Govern ment deemed it advisable to send reinforcements of Kida^s to Shahpur and Khci as a warning gesture to protect these places. General Gavian accompanied the reinforcements. Latest reports indicate that the Kurds have occupied a strategic position on the road between Kezaieh and ;$hahpur and are levying toll on all traffic. 1^8. It is generally accepted that the present Kurdish move ment is under the direct control of C,azi Mohamed althou#i he pretends to be on friendly terms with the social Democrats. General Dsneahian Commander-In-Chief of the Fida'is, left Tabriz about the middle of the month for ¥ahabad to organise the gendarmerie there, but the Kurds lost no time in sending him about his business saying that jy themselves would make such ar '®itnpza**” ■ranted. Hue to his anxiety over the situation m / pishavari *pishavari asked i,azi Mohamed to go there to examine the situation, 139• The Kurds claim riezaieh, friahpur, Vhoi and MianAaab as Kurdish tov/ns amd hitherto !*ussian influence has beer successful in curbing their restlessness. An apparently reliable report indicates that the Russian ConGUl-Oenersl in Tabriz visited Ururaieh district about the 25th of the monthi presumably with the object of inducing the Kurds once more to refrain from direct action against the Azer- *baijan provincial Government, and information received at the end of the month, was to the effect that the Kurds had withdrawn from the town of Resaieh. It is commonly rumoured that as a reward for his pains the Soviet diplomat was relieved of his purse and revolver on the return journey by two Kurdish gentlemen who showed scant respect for the dignity of his position. 140. Affriculturo. Crops are very poor, due to late rains and flooding, and the grapes have suffered much damage. On the 06th of September the provincial Council published a law to the effect that in accordance v/ith their scheme for the purchase and storage of wheat and barley for winter needs landowners and farmers must sell the suiounts specified to the Covemaent, these amunts being 75% in the case of landowners mi 20$ in the case of farmers. Failure to do ao would entail imprisonment for from 3 to 10 years and anyone caught trying to s^ggie grain outside of the Province, would receive the death penalty. It is not surprising that the Government are having difficulty in collecting grain as they have no money to pay for it end give credit noteg which afford little, if any satisfaction to the agriculturists. Considerable arreiety as to the adequacy of the winter stocks is felt in Government circles. 141. ^liac 3llaneous. No solution of the kenjan problem has so far been reported. It will be remembered # that the Azerbaijan Government during the movement sent a force of Plda’is there and the town was governed from Tabriz. Aft:?r the agreement with the Central Govern ment, however, -it was decided that the Governor of the town should be appointed by Tehran, but there was constant friction between the gendarmerie who followed him and the Picte’is. A delegation from Tabriz met a comission from Tehran in Zenjan and it appears that under a compromise arrangement the forces stationed there would con sist of 300 gendarmerie and 300 Fida^s, the officer commanding being appointed from Tehran and the second in command from Tabriz. Further disagreement ensued, however, when Tehran insisted that the Democrat elements should consist of persons bom or resident in Zenjen, and there is no present indication as to how or when the matter will be settled. On September 13th a reception was held at the Railway Head Office in Tabriz, to celebrate the handing over of the Azerbaijan railways by the Russians, but final arrangements in this regard were only made on September 2oth. It is reported that many items are missing. The lines are no?/ open for commercial traffic. The sugar factory at Kianduab owned by the Central Government and taken over by the Azerbaijan authorities la the scene of trouble with the growers of the beets, namely the Kurds, who want to run the factory themselves, claiming that the town is Kurdish. They threaten to grow no beets next year unless their demands are met, but a suggest ed compromise is that half the proceeds of the factory should go to the Kurds and half to the Azerbaijan provincial Government. A new monthly, “The Democrat”, has made its appearance in Tabris and is devoted to an exposition of the objects and activities of the • Democratic party. The local press, generally, continu Western Democracies ana most of tne articx 5?. b &amp;se«u^*.§s. unknown in Tabriz who are probably sponsored by the Russians ana wno have come from the Caucasus. / The tokensi The tokens issued by the Azerbaijan Government during the move ment and valued at one million tomans were withdrawn on Septeirther 2£nd* The Provincial Government owes 40*000 tons of wheat to *hissia for drain pipes* asphalt* piece goods* and other commodities supplied during the last six months- The Soviet-Azerbaijan Cultural society continues to be active and counts school teachers business men and other intelligentsia amongst its members. These joined during the occupation and now they they are afraid to withdraw or to associate themselves with British or American circles. It is estimated that the number of Fida* is in Azerbaijan is approxiaiately 30 1 000. public security has improved considerably and this is attributed in some measure to the fact that most of the scoundrels in the Province are now in the police Force. 70% of the Political Police are strangers and are believed to originate from Russian territory. Certain lands, the property of absentee landlords* have been divided up amongst farmers ‘‘in accordance with the principles of democracy*. Stocks of carpets are low as the factories cannot cope with heavy taxation and endless labour troubles. There is a fair demand for the Syrian and American markets. r *. mteh«ai oar*. R.M.

Anti-British and ^nti-American propaganda has continued throughout the month, plentifully supplied with material by the Moscow and Baku radios. 115. Local officials. The Governor-General of Azerbaijan, Dr. SalfPiullah Javici, left for Tehran by air on August 21st. (Last Diary, para. 98). went, on the invitation of ^avam as Saltaneh, as a member of the Delegation wh^ch, under the leadership of Ali ^habis- tary, the President of the *rovincial Council, included Sadia pade- gan, Vice-President of the Provincial Council and Beouty Chairman of the Democrat A arty, General Panahian, of the People’s Army and Sarhang (Colonel) Murtazavi, described as a ’military adviser’ . labi* i Kabiri, sometime Minister of Communications in the National Government, was to have gone, but appears to have dropped out at the last moment. 1 he Delegation should have left on August 15th., but its departure was rostponed, officially because of the Days of I ouming on August 17th. and 19th. (ST', para. 1157belov?). rohamed Birlya, Director of Education, resigned that post at the end of July on bis election to the chairmanship of the reconsti tuted Central Council of Azerbaijan Trade Unions. He is succeeded in the Denartment of Education by bis denuty, Dibayan. ?T«rullah Yegani, formerly Deputy Minister of the Interior in the National Government, has been appointed Chief of Police at Urumiah (Heaaieh). He is an old ^ida’i of the 1906 revolution. The Parmandar of Ardebil, Hahim KHAKPOUH, visited Tabriz at the end of August, in connection, it is believed, with the trouble there (see para. 127 below). Khakpour is another ’old liberal’. He held the post of Chief of Police in Tabriz for a short time under the moribund Persian regime last year. GShulam Yahia Daneshian, formerly Deputy Minister for the people’s Army, has been appointed Commandant of the Nigahban (Gendar merie) , with the curious commission to organize the Gendarmerie in Mahabad also. Daneshian is a thug of the type of the defunct Dadar (See last ^iary, para. 98) and was suspected to be the leader of the hushed-up revolt against pishavari earlier in the year. Dome people,therefore, interpret his orders to go and organize a gendarmerie in the Kurdish stronghold as a rather hopeful mano&amp;evre on pishavari’s part to write him off. But Daneshian is no doubt too old a bird to be caught with such obvious chaff. parabei, who, shortly after the revolution of last December was 'resident of the Field Tribunal in Tabriz, has been appointed Bakhshdar of ^harur in 'estern Azert&gt;ai,jan. Shapur is largely a Shikkak town and an Azerbaijan Democrat Hayor is not likely to be received with wild enthusiasm. 116. ^ The r ro V incial GoverpT ent. In the absence of Dr,Jav 4 % Dr. l A etasF7* -,?? armin3aroFTa^rrzTnd D^uty Governor-General is Ac ting Govern or-Gen eral. There was no plenary session of the Provincial Council during August. The Praesidlum of the Provincial approved on Aupust 3rd. a law for the establishment of Villa ge Coun cils (fand Anjumablar). /These- a - Tkese Councils will consist of from three to size of the village and they will be eloqtad for one ye C fivfer j. r* . ririxi e^f s aqcording to flim . r by univer- under a ^haim4 n their e village• and he ^al suffrage.

The Kadkhuda will be paid by a levy on the village 1 s crops. Other duties of the village Council include the maintenance of the public services, the supervision of agricultural matters, cleaning of canals, etc., and supervision of the repayment of loans made to peasants by the Agricultural Bank and the ^llection of crops. The best indication of the state of the finances of Azerbaijan is that work on the streets of Tabriz has ceased. This was a project dear to the Democrats* hearts and one that was winning them a large measure of popularity, for all men have equally suffered from those rugged ways. Happily the funds lasted long enough to complete the asphalting of most of the main streets in the centre of the town. 117. Negotiations with Tehran, Up to the end of August there was not the slimiest indication ’here of how the negotiations between the Azer baijan Delegation and $avara as ^Itaneh were progressing** that is, unless a growing uneasiness on the part of the Democrats can he taken as an indication that they were not going well. Press articles have complained that the Delegation was lodged outside Tehran and not allowed to communicate with anyone except the official negotiators. On August 15th., the date first proposed for the Delegation's departure,© send-off meeting was organized by the Democrat Party, pishavari, the principal speaker, declared that thou$i the Delegates were the trusted representatives of Azerbaijan, they had no authority to agree to anything that would be contrary to the clearly expressed wishes of the Azerbaijan people* their* task was to present the demands of Azerbaijan, not to negotiate a compromise. They were backed by the whole might of the Azerbaijan people and if Tehran did not agree to their demands, Azerbaijan was strong enough to take what it wanted by force. pishavari demanded the early holding of the elections for the Fifteenth Majlis, the revision of the Fundamental haw, the granting of wide powers to provincial Councils to make them effective instrum ents of local government, and the enactment as law of the Tehran/Tabriz Agreement of June 14th, These points may have formed part of the Democrat Party* s instructions to the Delegation. On the last day of the month these demands were followed up by a telegram *froin the people of Azerbaijan* to the Delegation demanding the immediate holding of the Majlis elections. 118* Party Affairs. A notice signed by Pishavari, wes published on AugusTTJn^TrTrmauncin^ that no Party member might leave Azerbaijan without the permission of the Central Committee. Ihe real purpose of this control is not apparent* it may he that there have been too many defections. There has been some hack-sliding in the local committees, particularly those of Xhoi and Hezaieh. Jaafar Pishavari visited both place* between August 8th and 10th., and treated the members to some candid comments on their failings, ending with the dismissal en bloc of the executive Committee in each town and the election of a new one. The newspaper nzerbai.jan piously hoped that after this shaking up the said committees would mend their ways. •Hie Ladies* Branch of VOKS has opened a Creche or Kindergarten for the children of Government officials and Democrat * arty members. Ten tomans a month will be charged for each child and this will include als. tHie Central Committee of the Democrat ^arty has moved its adiuarters to the centrally situated building occupied by the Russian “ y 3tSf w P t he improvement of the minds ^V^Led^It U „ and Politics (Huqoou wa Siyasa K.dr.s«i) has £.en full -l»s fo- l/‘ / c el ebrat ionI - 3 - celebration on SeptflKber 3rd. of the ’Glorious *^6 anniversary of the founding of the Democrat d ... Party in 1945* 119, The Pednle 1 s Array* There has been no dt£inite of any military operations Airing the month. An Officers’ Club was opened in Tabriz in the last weeV in August, The building is thought to be that formerly used as s club for the ^ed Army (Dorn Erasnoi Armii). It is intended as a cultural centre with facilities for sports, indoor recreations and cheap meals- ^0 Constitution pay. The anniversary of the Iranian Constitution of 1906 wag celebrated in a manner worthy of the birthplace of its heroes. There were parades of troops and ?ida’is on the morning of August 15th, t and a bust of Baghir Khan, completed f just in time, was unveiled by Jaafar Pishavari. His speech was cast in a heroic style suitable to the occasion* the Constitution was in danger, but Azerbai jan had not laid down its arms and what we did in 1006 we’ll do again, Ali Shabistary, President of the Provincial Couhcil, held a reception in the Council building in the evening. The guests were invited in different groups at successive hours. A he first group, consisting of the Government, iiiwiy Officers and Consular Corns, won their way through the milling crowd outside the building unscathed but before they had all left the police cordon broke and the irresistable forces of democracy took over, making a rapid and clean sweep of the Hamazan dainties which the first guests 1 refinement had left untested. 121. public security. The Party press has carried a few articles during the month criticising the Police* they are taken up for over bearing behaviour and warned that this is not the old regime and the people are no longer to be bullied by the lackeys of the land lords, tin justice to the police It should be said that their bullying - if the accusation is true - is practised very unobtrusively). As the Governor-General, according to the Tehran press, has announced that the whole of Azerbaijan’s security forces are under the command of Jaafar Gavian, it is presumed that the Democrats have imple mented their promise to make the Gendarmerie resronsible to the Police Department, On the past record of the Gendarmerie in this province, and on the record of the Tida’is who form the new Gendarmerie, this is a reform for which there is much to be said. On August 99th. the Chief of Police posted a notice forbidding the carrying of arms without license. It was expressly stated that Kurds and other tMhesmen coming into the town must denosit their arms at the police stations and recover them when leaving. Thlle a reduct ion in the number of arms carried about Azerbaijan is from any point of view a good thing, the chief purpose of this new ordef seems to be to prevent the Kurds buying more arms. In a crowded mosque in Tabriz one evening towards the close of Ramazan a Democrat was moved to rise and address the congregation on the necessity for atheism. One of the assembled True-Bel levers, im patient to put the other side of the case, drew his snickersnee and cut the speaker’s throat. The Chief Democrat mullah, who ranks as Chaplain- General to the forces, chancing to pass at the time, entered and thought to clear the atmosphere with a few revolver shots. In the ensuing confusion the victorious polemicist disappeared. 122. xT c Hie and Finance. The press during the month has urged economyi expenses should be cut down, the staff of Government departments reduced, and cuts made in the budget. The newspape r Azerbaijan on August 15th. carried a bitter attack on the Governor of ?h e Hat ion a 1 Bank of Iran, accusing him of intriguing with the reactionary Azerbai jan emigres in Tehran and conspiring to murder Liberty with a financial stranglehold. Repeatedly the Democrats have demanded payment by the National Bank of 15 million tomans due to Azerbaijan depositors. Dhdoubt* edly the Democrat Government here could use those fifteen millions and there is this much truth In the accusations of conspiracy, that while rich merchants here when requested by the Democrats to draw on their accounts with the Bank Nllll profess the utmost willingness, / they- 4 ~ I Jw k C l they privately instruct their agents in Teh ran ^o^i^ve-^thejir cheques blocked. . ^ A . It may be presumed that the Azerbaijai ^legation n®/ negotiating in Tehran will demand not only these 15 millions but-othei* hig grants of money. , a . ^ Both the Russians and the Economics Department have made consider able sales of sugar and cotton piece goods during the month. ‘he bazaar is well stocked with cotton materials, possibly more Indian and /retailAmerican than Russian, all selling/for about 30 rials the metre. The 'Thrice of sugar has risen during August, and ended at about 70 rials per kilo retail. There is an increasing flow of American goods into Tabriz; chiefly toilet requisites, plastic and celluloid articles of all kinds, haberdashery and fancy goods. Ihe prices of other imported articles, such as electric kettles, irons, primus stoves, lamps, etc. shovy a noticeable decline. The market for such articles in this province is naturally soon saturated, and the fall in these prices is no indication of the real cost of living. To the majority of Azerbaijanis it does not matter whether a piece of soap costs a penny or a pound! the real distress is caused by the rise in price of commodities with the use of which all are acquainted, such as flour, ghee, sugar and tea. There have been numerous complaints about the decline in the quality of the bread# Carpet buying for the foreign market has continued steadily throughout the month. Prices remain high. The village carpets, which are chiefly In demand, show no change from the prices of six months ago (about 110 tomans per arshin), while Tabriz carpets are if anything dearer. 123. Industry and labour. The Azerbaijan Labour Law, approved by the Praesidiuin of tne National Assembly on ay l&amp;th., was published on August 25th. It is drafted in more detail and with care than most Azerbaijan laws. Points of interest are are its recognition of the Azerbaijan Trades Union as an authority having equal weight with the Ministry of labour in all matters of emnloyment, and its establish ment of a Disputes commission to settle industrial disputes on the lower level. ( ahmat va Raf f l lunaqasha Kbmissioni - Commission for Labour and Removal of Disputes). It provides for full pay on all official holidays and for all days when work ceases by the wish of the factory owner and half pay for stoppages from causes beyond the owner** control# Annual paid holidays from one fortnight to one month depend ing on the class of work are also prescribed. The principle of the minimum wage is laid down, but the figure is left to be fixed by future legislation. The law also states that f in order to obtain their legitimate demands workers have the right, when authorised by their Trade Union, to strike* the strike is to be respected by the Govern ment Authorities and the employer must pay full wages during the perio* of the strike 1 , 124. agriculture. Difficulties are being experienced in the col lecting of grain under the Azerbaijan Crops Division Law. Neither peasants nor landlords are trying honestly to apply the law, and there is a risk that, between them, the flow of this harvests grain to the urban market will be obstructed. There are already rumours of short ages in some centres. The provincial Government has made out a scheme of grain purchase by which they will acquire 70$ of the landlords* share of wheat and 10% of the barley and 20% of the peasants* share of wheat. The village councils are empowered to collect these purchases and the military authorities are ordered to help where necessary, but there is no news yet to show how successfully the •eherne is being carried out# 125. Russian Affairs. Rarly in the month there were rumour* of concentrations of troops on the Russian side of the frontier, and these stories were immediately linked in popular talk with the move* ment of British Indian troops to Basra.

The Azerbaijan^ side of the frontier, at points where it has been possible fov relable observers to approach it - i.e.at Julfa and Astara, i»-guarded by.J^ida^s who f ive the impression of being hand-picked from the 'f-uhajir element they may even be Soviet citizens). They are exceedingly suspicious and unaccommodating even with the Azerbaijan civil and military officials who administer the frontier districts. Later in the month rumours began to circulate that Soviet j troops had actually crossed the frontier and were expected in Tabriz. JTo foundation whatever could be discovered for these rumours. They are no doubt based partly on speculation and partly on the fact that there is a fluctuating and changing Thissian population of Tabriz whose/no one seems^to discover. /occupation/ The Soviet Railway Commission (see last Diary, para. Ill) arrived in Tabriz on August 27th. It was at first reported that the handing over of the Tabriz-Julfa railway was proceeding, but later there seemed to be a hitch, and an Azerbaijani railway official re marked that he believed the commission had not cdfae to hand over but to augment the party of ‘Russian railway officials already here. In &amp; any case, it seems likely that the Hussians would wait for some authorised representatives to come from Tehran, and that will probably depend on the outcome of the negotiations now going on. The Soviet commission numbers five, including two colonels. A small party of hissianr-musaleians, led by the Director of the Leningrad Conservatory, who had been staying in Tehran, passed through Tabriz and gave a short concert at the National Theatre on August 8th. 126. The Kurdish Districts . o v azi lohamed, leader of the Kurdish National Government, visited Bezaieh and Shapur in the first week in August. Details about his visit are lacking, but the general effect seems to have been to confirm the Hurds of those parts in not budg ing from their claim to administer Western Azerbaijan. He had a talk with the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Bezaieh and as good as promised him protection in return for the support of his community against the Azerbaijan democrats. The Archbishon, who has survived many upheavals and seen the Kurds in all their aspects, did not commit himself but frankly told ^azi lohamed that Assyrian policy was fomulatedby their fears. ♦‘The time of fear,' 1 said the 'azi, grandly, M is past’ 1 . m Pishavari, who followed §azi Kohamed hotfoot to western Azerbaijan, tried to reach some settlement with him, but admitted failure. Meanwhile, though the Azerbaijan Democrat adrr.inistration remains nominally in power, it seems as ineffectual as the old Persian adainistratioh which it replaced last December. It lacks support even among the ’Ajam residents of Rezaieh town. It is said, for Instance, that there are now five different parties in existence there. Azerbaijan Fida’is patrol the town, but so d&amp; armed Kurdish bands, while the Kurds are in complete control of all the surrounding country-side. , Towards the end of the month there was news of division among the Kurdsi Rashid Beg Herki and Hurl Beg of the Begzadeha were reported to have had a fight over the division of some crops and one of the latter’s men is said to have been killed. Ifce Kurds of the Rezaieh region are refusing to apply the Azerbaijan crop-division law, and in this they are, oi course, sup ported by the ’Ajam landlords. Moreover, they have ruled that the Azerbaijan law dividing the estates of erring landlords among the peasants is Koranically invalid, and they are said to have given vx sequestered estates back to their owners, exacting, for their own account, payment of the gikat (Alms) of one third of the produce required by Cenon Law. About the middle of the month there was a report that a force of KUrds from Taghiahad had moved into ianduao an^cla .d it for the Kurdirih National Government. ome rein.o,cement*,of t /Peonls’s' r r^ I 1 tension, the h as it was, hern. 1 &gt; - 6 - C ( &lt; • JL A Peopled Array were sent fi*om Tabriz, and Jritt' affaires eeras to have blown over, leavinp the position with Kurds and Azerbaijanis sharing thejplace between j 127 • Ardehil. Shortly before they left Tor Tehran, the Oovemor- 0enera 1, AiI %abistary and General panahian vivsited Ardebil. ^ Their purpose, it is believed, was to try to compose differences which had become acute between the local Democrat Authorities and the ^ahsevan chiefs. If so they seer to have been unsuccessful, for about the 25th. August there began to circulate persistent rumours that the 'hahsevens h*d occupied the town and that they were supported by Sultan Zulftaari \ k &gt; long held out against the Democrats in the len.jan region earlier in the year. It was even reported that an ambush for the Governor-General and his companions had been laid by the Ghahsevans, but that it mis carried because of a change in the time-table. Troops and Pida’is are believed to have been despatched from Tabriz and Garab. The Shahsevans have undoubtedly no love for the Democrats, but it was fairly certain, last year at any rate, that they were poorly armed, and, unless they have received substantial aid from outside the province it is unlikely that they eould even defend themselves against a concentration of Pi da* is, let alone occupy Ardebil. Tribal restless ness may ecibarrass the Democrat Administration and may even cause it to lose some of its officials (it is possible that Sadig Dadar was killed by the ^hahsevana) but it can never be a serious threat to the stabil ity of tlia regime here* the Russians did not go to all the trouble of the December revolution to see it reversed by a few reactionary herds men chiefs. General Glinsky, the Soviet Commandant in Azerbaijan, it should be remembered, was particularly interested in disarming the shahsevans last August. 128. Armenian Affairs. Dnigration to Soviet Armenia continued during August, and Ae quota of 4,500 from Azerbaijan should have been nearly completed by the end of the month. Inevitably, stories of racketeering are rife* many of the emigrants are urban workers and .small tradespeople who have no desire to labour on the land in Russia. They thought to secure their allocation to the town of Driven by bribing the Committee here* the bribes vrere taken, but on arrival in Soviet Amnnenia they were allocated to the country just the same. Ihere was vague talk of some investigation of the affair, but considering the experience and; astuteness of the type of Doviet citizen employed in such affairs here an investigation is not likely to get very far. 'frieir fellow Armenians in the retail t^ade seem also to have made a very good thing out of supplying the unsophisticated villagers from Western Azerbaijan as they passed through Tabriz. The emigrants were not allowed to shop in Tabriz town, and at the only establishment where they could buy - near the station - profits of 200 and 300 percent on clothes and boots are said to have been made. 129. Foreign Officials. Colonel Sexton, the United States military Attach^ and his assistant, Captain Gogarin, visited Tabriz by road on August 15th., travelling via Astara and Ardebil. They left for Tehran via Fianeh and Zenjan on august 19th. Mr* Itobert Bossow, Secretary of the United States .embassy at Tehran and formerly United States Vice-Consul here, stayed in Tabriz between August 17th. and 24th. British Consulate-General, J.K.Viell. Acting Consul-General. Tabriz. August 31st., 1946Tabriz uiary for L r 23&amp;P July. COf^V ■; x r i «#- o. » 9b3 ,.T JiOjtLu o \\V /”ery few more fruits of the Tabriz/ greeraent can be dis cerne d r&amp;S thaq? were apparent, after Li^it* s working, at the end June. 'The execution of the 97. General ituation, Tehran a fortnight’ clauses of the written .Agreement could, in any case, make little difference to the regime here. The important questions of the /^rnry, the Gendarmerie and the powers of the Provincial Council, depending for a solution on the findings of Commissions and on laws yet to be passed by a Central ~ r ajlis which has yet to meet, have made no progress. The democrats are not worrying * to tho^, these problems are solved and the question is simply ona o** find ing a method of defending their own solution o^ thorn if Tehran should begin to agitate. They are content to wait for Tehran to make the first move in the matter. The Agreement has, however, resulted in the opening of communications v/ith Tehran, to everyone’s benefit. It has, too, produced a more hopeful mood in the townspeople which is p^locted in an improvement of trade and an attendance at caf^s and other •public places such as hns not been seen 'ince last summer. hit this relaxation is more apparent than real* * crypto-reactionaries* such as the Tabriz landless who made too joyful a hound towards freedom after the Agreement have found that the rone round their necks is still made fast to the Democrat picket and they have been brought up with a jerk. Azerb-.ijan-&amp;irdish relations have not improved during the month, and there is some evidence to suggest that the Russians have had to make an effor 1/to prevent serious dlamtes in the mixed districts. .jiti-British propaganda has received an i?iportant stim ulus from the happenings in ^badan and the Persian Gulf, and the Azerbaijan Democrats have lavishly embroidered their claim to be the leaders of the toiling masses of all Iran in their struggle against British Imperialis . 98. Local '.•'ficials. Dr. Sa la mull ah Javid, Governor-General of A zerbaij an, arrived in Tabriz on July 4th. and was met with full military honours. He sent cards to the Foreign Consuls on the following day and received their visits in the course of the next two or three days, ^ile not required to o so by the Protocol, he returned these visits in person and showed hi^olf as amiable as his somewhat gauche manner permits. To both tha British and American Consuls he intimated that he hoped no hard feelings were entertained about wh*&gt;t was passed and gone. His official title in Turk! is * Vali*, and, the two parts o r Azerbaijan being now united in one administration, the ter»ais ‘Third and fourth Ustans’ have h^en discarded for the official description, * ?*ov1nee ze^baijan‘. Jaafar ^avian, inister foy the People’s nr*,'y in the Azerbaijan national Government, and since June Idth. unemployed, was appointed Chief of Police in Azerbaijan and t^ok up his new duties early in the month. ! e had the Azerbaijan rank of general, which he presumably retains. fadiq Dadar, formerly Chief of Security ' olice under the National Government, for a time Chief of olice in Azerbsijan, and lately Chief of Police at Ardabll, v/as killed on the road between Ardebil and Miahgin Shahr on or about July 23rd. The official version is that a firearm he was carrying went off accidentally, but there are many rumours current, some attributing his death to an act of vengeance, others say in * he was removed by order of the Democrat authorities. Dadar, whose antecedents are obscure - he is reputed to be a iuhajir who formerly ran a bakery in Tabriz - was himself a gunman and the murderer of the Iranian police officer, Vakili, in a Tabriz street last December. The Tabriz authorities decreed memorial services for him on two days end ordered the police toowear mourning bands. _A certain Jabbarzari, said to have been formerly Governor of Zenjan, has been appointed Governor (Farmandar) of Knoi. The Governor of aku is Jbharaed Kabiri, the brother of tebi* i Kaoiri, ex-minister of Communications in the National Government. Towards the end of the month there were reports that the Governor-General had been summoned to Tehran to report on the carrying out of the Agreement, but he seemed in no hurry to go. 99. The /♦zerbo Lian srtav. There nas been no news of military operations during the month. A small commission of Iranian officers, headed by 'arbeng Alavi, came to Tabriz with Dr. Javid on July 4th., nreeumably to Implement the clause of the Agreement which provided for a mixed Commission to settle the question of the Peoria*s Army. ?To head way was made in the matter and ^arhanr Alavi returned to Tehran about the middle of the month. Another Iranian officer, ^arhang ^foams Palik Ara, who was supposed to deal with the conversion of the ^ida* is into the new Genda'mnerie or ?Tirphhan . made equally little progress. He is reported to have sai r1 tSat the ^ida*is could not he formed ep masse into a rendarmorie as he could only take those under thirty. This, naturally, would not be accertahle to the ^ida* is. Tn any case, the Democrats are not likely to make a serious effort to modify the existing organization of forces to suit Tehran. The t? ida , is v/ere the spear-head of the revolution and they still remain a ueeflil argument. llie Tabriz ilitary College spears to have ceavsed to function, ishavari is reported as saying that those Army Officers who parsed out from the College and received Azerbaijan commissions earlier in the year will have to attend the Military College at Tehran and take their examinations again* only if they pass in Tehran will they be confirmed in their ranks. This would be in the spirit of the Agreement which defines the -eople*s Army as part of the Iranian Army. 100. The provincial Council, fherb was no plenary session of the provincial Council during the month. 101 • De mocrat ^ art;/ n IT airs. A Congress of the Azerbaijan Youth l ovement v/as held on July 6th. The leader of the Democrat r arty, Jaafar Pishavari, could not attend through illness, but sent a written message. The Vice-Chairman of the Party, Sadiq Padegan, also gave the Congress his blessing by letter. The Youth 'ovement, which seems to include children from toddlers upwards, has provided a sort of blue drill uniform for it*' members, but there do not seem to be enough suits to go round as yet. Its chief public activity is marching along the streets end singing the patrioti^ ditty, ’’Azerbaijan '. The Democrat Party’s election campaign gathered momentum during the month. There are two no^nts o^* interest in their propaganda* one, that no complaint is made about the delay in bold ing the ? ajlis elections, and second, a monotonous insistence that if the elections ^o against the ’liberal parties* the latter, led by the Azerbaijan Democrat Party, will use force to attain their ends. 102. Press and ^roragando. i^aridun Ibrahimi, sometime Public Prosecutor in the National Government, was appointed special correspondent of the newspaper Azerbaijan to cover the Paris Peace conference and left for France aoout ine middle of the month. un July 22nd. a mass meeting of workers was called at short notice to protest against the ‘murder of Iranian workers by the i-nglo-Iranian oil Company 1 at ^badan. Democrat press and radio claimed that 3u,0CQ people attended the meeting, but in reality the number was something under one thousand, iohamed Diriya, Chairman of the workers’ union and Director of education, gave a libellously garbled version of the incidents at ^badan on July 14th. and 15th. and called on the workers of Azerbaijan to avenge theiu martyred brothers. The Acting British Consul-general later drew the attention of the vjovemor-General to the in; ccuraelee of Biriya* s /statements• 3 — /who stateioents about the a.X.o.C. 'ihis incident has given Ureat Britain the lead again in her competition with America for first place in the Democrat hyian of hate, xhe appearance of two British warships in the rersian viulf was, of course, played up by the press, and Moscow radio on the ^badan incident was quoted at length. Banging further afield, the democrats began to canvass signatures for a telegram to '&lt;iavara as Saltaneh declaring that ^aerbaijan would never sheathe the aword until Bahrein and Koweit had been return ed to Persian sovereignty, and Biriya 1 s own newap&amp;ner, Cgialaba . apneared with the ancient fable of British connivance at the trade in Baluchi slave-girls across the €hilf. 103. Trade union activity. The first 'Congress of the Workers and Toilers of AzerbaiJ?-n' : met in Tabriz on July ?3rd., under the presidency of Mohamed Biriya and Sadiq Padegan. A delegate from ^enjan took part. The report of its proceedings was pub lished too late for comment in this Biary. The Congress elected K. Louis 3aillant, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Uhlans, to be honorarv president, and ^.Kousnetsoff, Vice- President of the orld Federation of Trade Uhions, to be an honorary member of the executive committee. It was doubtless from modesty only that the Confess did not presume to offer this honour to the President of the Torld Federation of Trade Unions. M.Louis oaillant, who had been staying in Tehran, visited Tabriz op July 25th. and 26th. He was accompanied by i3usta?a ul 1 Aria, delegate of the Trade Unions of Syria and Lebanon, by Dr. Kishavarz, of the Central Committee of the Tudeh T ar ty ? by Mr. Husta, delegate of the Central Committee of the Irania n Workers' Union, and by what the Turk! newspaper described as a 'number of other fellow-travellers' (Yoldashlar). Saillant spoke both to a public meeting when he was welcomed to the town and to the Congress of Azerbaijan Workers. If the published versions of his speeches are accurate they contained nothing except the usual platitudes, flattery of the Democrats and praises of the Soviet Union. A Frenchman/was present, being one of the few in the audience who could understand Saillant’s own words, said his speech was 'moderate’. ’ustafa ul 'Aria, speaking in Arabic, which fewer still could understand, is reported as making a more violent attack on 'Imperialism'. Rusts and Kisha varz, of course, made the most of the Abadan incident. All Tabriz factories are now required to provide snorts ^rounds and equipment for their workers. The portly Hajjis who still own the Khosrovi Leather Factory - to whom unpaid exertion must seem the ultimate insanity of the times - have bowed to the duty of turning out, for nothing, footballs and football boots. Hie Democratic Tarty is undertaking a new classification of all workers, perhaps preparatory to a reorganization of the present workers * Union. 1Q4. Finance. A fuller report of the speech made by Dr. Jsvid at Tehran atihe end of June gives the following figures of credits and supplies granted by the Central Government to Azer baijan* One million tomans (from the Shah's privy purse) for the Tabriz water supply project* 14 million cigarettes* 3 million metres of cotton piece goods* 300,000 tomans for reconstruction work in Azerbaijan towns (Javid asked for two million)* 373 cases of medicines* 2 trucks for telephone line repair works 2 tractors for the Department of Agriculture* 15 million tomans to be credited to the Tabriz branch of the Bank Hilli to cover local accounts. Most of these grants, except perhaps the medicines and the trucks are still promises and will probably remain so. The Democrats' insistence that the Tabriz branch of the Bank Hilli shall obtain and keep sufficient cash to cover all Azerbaijan /accountsaccounts is curious and suggests that the Tteraocrate really believe that they can achieve a large measure of financial independence* The demand is not likely to be comnlied with. ^arly in July a new manager of the Bank Hill! arrived here* a certain ^akhoradian* an Armenian, formerly manager o^fcthe Meshed branch. He soon began to comnlain that the authorities would not let him do normal business in the bazaar, to which the Bamocrats retorted.that he could do normal business after he had brought in the missing fifteen millions, triable to see his way out of the impasse, Bakhoradian took a trip to Tehran. The newly founded National Bank of Azerbaijan, on the other hand, in spite of its doubtful foundations, is doing a roaring trade, lending money right and left at 9 r £, on, seemingly, no security other than Democratic principles* It is reported but not yet officially confirmed that the Azerbaijan Customs dues imposed by the National Government will in future be payable to the Tabriz Municipality. Under the Agreement the administration of Customs returns to the control of the Central Government, but the Democrats obviously do not intend to give up any source of revenue* Certain of the export dues, however, appear to have been cancelled. 105. Comunications* The postal service between Tabriz and Tehran resumed normal working after the Agreement, and by the end of July most of the five or six months’ accumulation of mails had been disposed of. Little if any mail seems to have been lost or destroyed during the long hold up. The Post and Telegraph service, being controlled according to the Agreement by Tehran, provides an indication of how the Democrats will a^ply the Agreement* the Party maintains two censors in the Tabriz Post Office and all mail is is well sifted. The chief aim seems to bo to stop reactionary news- nap ers, and it is reported that the censors have orders to stop all non-Tudeh newspapers except those addressed to foreign Constilates. The Journal de Tehran addressed to the British Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran is anparently being stonped. Abbas Gull Tahiri has been appointed Director of Telegraphs in Tabriz. He is an old emnloyee of the Tele^aphe and under the National Government he was assistant to Babi* i Kablri, then Fin later of Communications. After the nominal withdrawal of the °oviet censor last year Tahiri was retained by the ^issians to report on all telegrams handled by the Tabriz office. Tehran seems to have had little to do v/ith his new appointment. The prohibition on the sending of code telegrams by commercial firms and individuals imposed by the National Government has now been lifted. Aza d Gill at, the official newspaper of the Provincial Council, announced on June 30th. that “travellers in Azerbaijan and to other parts of Iran 11 no longer required an Azerbaijan police permit. Later, however, the Chief of Police published a notice saying that persons who were members of the Gendarmerie before the revolution and those former Government employees who were discharged after December 12th*, 1945, may not travel to Tehran unless provided with a police permit. Foreign Consuls may travel in their district only with the written authorisation of the Governor-General. The authorisation is strictly interpreted and no deviation from the named route is permitted. Travellers to and from Tehran are still searched by Fide’Is at the approaches to Tabriz. One of the excuses alleged Is the prevention of the importation of narcotics. Moreover^ while the normal transfer of funds through the benks is new permitted, the Hida*ls still prevent travellers taking out currency with them. Abul Ha assn Sadlqi, a member of the Central Ministry of Coaanunigations, and some other railway technicians arrived by road with the new Governor-General on July 4th. Their business, accord ing to Dr. Javid, is to make preliminary surveys for the Mianeh- Tabriz railway. The line will follow the trace which was made before the war, and pass through Maraghah, approaching Tabriz from the south of the Bah and Fountain. The same party was to survey the main roads of Azerbaijan. /106106« Affriculture. July is the only month in the year when the average Azerbaij an land-owner takes an interest in husbandry. /to This year/%he most of them the Tabriz/Tehran Agreement seemed to come just in time for them to get the crop-division law of last April altered in their favour. A body of landlords petitioned the Governor-General to make a net/ regulation giving them the trad itional shares. Javid said he would put the proposal up to Tehran, but as he is one of the Democrats who made the new law this was probably only his way of putting the landlords off. ^ Immediately the Democrat Party issued a stern warning that it would allow no part of the National Government's legislation to be scrapped and followed this up with a notice that the full penal ties would be inflicted on all landlords - and peasants - who failed to obey the law of last April. The notice is said to have been issued on the advice of the Soviet Consul-General. This may or may not be true, but Russia is certainly interested in securing the maximum collection of grain in Azerbaijan. Ihe Authorities are alive to the danger of some of the harvest being lost through the landlords' fear ot peevishness and there are signs that they will step in themselves to save it. The Governor of Haragha has already warned the landlords of his district that if they do not collect their shares the local auth orities will do it at the landlords' expense. # Trade. Business improved appreciably during the month t the one substantial change the Agreement has made is to allow a freer flow of commodities and money between Tabriz and Tehran. There was more activity in the carpet market, but Tabriz stocks are low as productjjMi has fallen off. The local Department of Economics was selling suJVr throughout the month. ITost of it was bought for Tehran, and the local price has consequently gone up* soft sugar is now about Es 170 per batman. Most staple 'commodities increased in price during July. The Democrats' earlier efforts to control prices seem to have flagged. Bread (Sangeh) rose from P» 1.25 per sheet to Ksl.50i eggs from 40 dinars each to 80, and butter by about 20%, Popular opinion puts the blame for the rise in prices on the Ussians who are generally thoughtjto be systematically buying up all Azerbai jan's surplus foodstuffs. They have in fact bought important quantities of wheat and sheep on the hoof during July, but, on the other hand, it has always been noticed in the past that when the • Russians were buying price control was strictly enforced, ^ost of their purchases now are made through Tabriz contractors, not through the Soviet Trade Agency. There was an increased demand for money in the bazaar. Moneylenders* rates at the end of the month were from 18 to 24% per annum. 108. Kurdish Affairs. Gazi Mohamed, leader of the Kurdish National Government, returned from Tehran by air on July 9th. He made no statement about his conversations in Tehrshn, but the general inference is that they led nowhere. About the middle of the ronfch there were reports that amed Kurds from the ^afrour region, chiefly ^jhikkak, owing al legiance to Omar Khan, exasperated by the Azerbaijan Democrats' failure to satisfy their territorial claims, had moved vast and partly occupied Khoi, where they had taken over the Finance and Police Departments as their share of the administration of a mixed district. A visit to Khoi on July 21st. showed that there was no Kurdish occupation and the local Democrat authorities denied the rumours of Kurdish participation in the administration. Prom unofficial sourses, however, it seems that a considerable body of Kurd* did enter the town and that reinforcements of Fida* is were sent from 'Tabriz as a counter measure. The Kurds were persuaded to withdraw without a clash. One story, perhaps the most probable, is that the persuasion was exercised by three Soviet political officers who were sent hurriedly to deal with the situation. From Khoi to kaku, which is also claimed by the Kurds, the Azerbaijan authorities were seen on July 21st. and 22nd. to be in coa^lete control of the road. /OmarJ - 6 - Oraaf spent some time in Tabriz in the middle of the month, it beinp credibly reported that he had been invited by the Govern or-General to consult on the situation in Khoi. On July 16th. the Counsellor of the United states embassy in Tehran, Mr. Ward, accompanied by the United States Vice-Consul in Tabriz, visited Mahabad. They went at the invitation of Gazi Mohamad who provided them with the escort of a Kurdish Lieutenant Colonel, Sadiqi Haidari, who, it seems, is Director of Culture in the Kurdish National Government. (The Kurds do not use the term Minister’). Gazi Mohamed saw the visit as a chance to awaken American sympathy for the Kurdish cause and the Kurdish authorities in Mahabad made great efforts to impress their visitors, making an enthusiastic convert of the Vice-Consul, at least. According to his account, the Kurds he met, including Kajji Baba, President of the Assembly and Saif ul Gazi, Director of the Army, talked frankly and reasonably, concealing none of their contempt for the Azerbaijan Democrats. Uiey impressed him with their smartness and efficiency, the freedom of their regime, their military bearing and particularly the genuineness of their national movement. He declared that he saw no evidence of ftoissian inspiration or direction. ( ir. Dooher has been in Azerbaijan only since March and in the Near East only about a year.) He was told ,he said, that the Kurds would accept the following minimum settlement with Tehran* A Kurdish Governor-General, a Provincial Council, the guarantee of their cultural rights and an Army officered in the main by Kurds. They would be willing to accept an Iranian Commander in Chief. He heard some talk of a United Kurdistan embracing the Kurdish districts of Iraq and Turkey, but the Mahabadis to whom he gave credence rather played this down. He came back apparently convinced first that the Russians have nothing to do with the Kurdish National movement, and second, that the Kurds will fight for their minimum demands. Cne conclusion to be drawn from this report is that the [ Kurds are at least better propagandists than the Azerbaijanis, who [ certainly have not gone out of their way to woo American sympathy. Hut then, the Kurds, while obviously dependent on Russian er- j couragement and material assistance, are not very happy about Communism. The Azerbaijanis, being completely in the toils, have no choice but to be more rlussian than the Soviets, whereas the Kurds, involved with Russians, Azerbaijanis and Persians, none of whom they love, may well believe that to bring in a sympathetic America will increase the number of possible moves in the game. 109. vezaieh. News from Western Azerbaijan during the month has been contused, but in the last week in July the Democrat Adminis tration there seems to have got into difficulties. The presence of strong Kurdish forces in all the surrounding district obvious ly offers tempting possibilities to the incurably factious people of Bezaieh, i&amp;tslims, Assyrians and Armenians alike. There has always been, too, an independent spirit in the Democrat Party of Rezaieh which resents its subordination to the predominantly Tabriz Central Committee. It was reported towards the end of the month that the Bezaieh Committee had telegraphed to Jaafar Pishavari demanding that the credentials of the Bezaieh deputies to the Provincial Council should be cancelled and new elections held. Pishavari is rumoured to have agreed to this demand, but Gadiq Padegan and some other members of the Central Committee have been sent to investigate. 'Ihe Kurds, no doubt, are fostering this growth of dis sension between Rezaieh and Tabriz. Frequent reports are re ceived of the studious fair-dealing of the Kurds, particularly the virtuous conduct of one Kamil Beg of the Begzadehs who appears to be the Kurdish Quartermaster in Rezaieh and who is exploiting the propaganda charms of novelty by making the Kurds pay for everything they take for the supply of their forces. This seems so attractive to the people of Rezaieh that even the ’Ajam merchants of the town are reported to be declaring that /theythey want a Kurdish government. Rezaieh land-owners, too, are feeling an unwonted affection for the Kurds, for, if Rezaieh is in ^urdistan, t..e Azerbaijan crop-division law clearly cannot apply VM 1 A v7 a , .. °? e reporu r-'ts tT^e number of the Kurdish contingent furnished Hezaieh region for the Sardasht-r'aqqiz front at S f OOC horse ana toot, lost of these were said to have returned bv the end of the month. ^ rs ,* The scheme of emigration to Srivan has at ^. st go\, under way.

A few Armenian villages in the Shahpur and Kara Dagh areas have emigrated en bloc. Tabriz •reactionaries’ believe that the Russians intend to bring in an equivalent number of Soviet Azerbai jani muslims to replace the emigrant Armenians. ^Tl. .ffFggt3 1 Three Russian journalists, Alexander Sure off, /. Anibar (?; and Mohamad Arif, a Soviet Azerbaijani, visited Tabriz during the month and were feted by the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society and the Poets’ Union. A party of over fifty 'oviet railway technicians is reported to have arrived in Tabriz late in the month. This may be the com mission mentioned in paragraph 90 of the last Oiarv. Another story Is that they are to work on the ’^ianeh-Tabriz railway. Tabriz residents claim that there has been a large influx °T pviet Azerbaijanis during this month and that many of the houses vacated by the Armenians are being reserved for them. The^e statements are difficult to check* a ll that can be said from neiv. sonax observation is that the number of 'hissian sneakers (and Russian-looking taces) in public places has certainly not decreased since June. jbb'iri.Cb r interests.

It had been obvious from our view of the town that the only /forces- 3 - ta t ere were Azerbaijan troops and Fids* is* in fact, during our two hours' stay vfe saw only one Kurd and he was unarmed. However, Captain Gogarin asked the Assistant Faraandar what the truth of the rumour was. The question caused an exchange of thoughtful looks among officials, and the Assistant Fanaandar replied with a speech in the style of a Democrat newspaper Leader, to the effect that though the Kurds, of course, had their separate Government outside Azerbaijan, within Azerba ijan there were neither Kurds nor rt /ijam ,, , but only Azer baijanis. He made it clear, all the same, that there were no Kurds sharing in the admin ist ret ion of Khoi. 9. Sty Armenian driver, meanwhile, was talking with local people in the garage, and he later informed me that about a fortnight before a force of some three hundred Kurds of the 3hikkak, bearing allegiance to Omar Khan, had entered the town and had taken over the police and finance department and had set up control posts on the Eastern approehes to Khoi. Some days later the democrat Government at Tabriz had despatch ed a force 700 Fida’is to Khoi and on the arrival of this force the Kurds had withdrawn. There had been no fighting. 10* We also tried to clear up the question of passes for travel within Azerbaijan. The Security Police official, who was obviously the authority on this, said that travel could be permitted only on t£ie authorisation of the Govern or-General. When asked if this applied also to natives of Azerbaijan he gave no definite rerly. 11. The road from Khoi to Kaku (about 95 miles) I found in no worse repair than when I travelled on it last year, but here again, it would need considerable improvement to make it fit to bear much military traffic. The country is very sparsely inhabited and there are no control posts. In Maku we were stopped by a policeman who took us to the Govemorate, where we found preparations had been made for our arrival. The Farmandar was absent in Tabriz and his place was taken by his assistant, an elderly, subdued-looking man, a native of Maku, who gave the impression of being an old minor government official whom the Democrats had retained for his usefulness. He said he had learnt Russian during the occupation in the 1914-18 war. His orders, clearly, were not to let us out of his sight and he underwent some mental suffer ing which could not but excite compassion when Captain Gogarin decided to go for a walk while I stayed in the house. He got out of the dilem ma by leaving a sentry outside the room while he himself accompanied the Captain on his stroll. 12. We asked the Assistant Fam^ndar for permission to visit the frontier post of Bazergan and the village of Batfhcheh Jikh, a few miles along the road to Bazergan, where, but for the obduracy of the Soviet Town Co’mnandant, I should have been entertained last year (please see my Despatch Wo. 11 of August 13th,, 1945) . The Assistant Farmandar refused us permission to go to Bazergan as it was not written on our pass, but seemed willing to permit us to go, under escort, to Baghcheh Jikh. However, at that point the local Head of the Security Hoi ice came in, and after scrutinizing our document and holding a whispered conversation with the Assistant i^armandar flatly refused to let us move out of the town. The Security Policeman, having made sure we could get up to no mischief, then departed and left the burden of our enter tainment on the shoulders of the titular authority. The latter’s native hospitality was not altogether strangled by the controls of Democrat policy and he proved an attentive if cautious and uncommunicative host. But to receive hospitality at all from Democrat authorities is a vast improvement on the conditions that have prevailed since the revolution of last December, and the Assistant Farmandar clearly could not be blamee d for the aggressive spirit of the Vaku fleas or the sand-flies which gave them such close air support. A3 Wtp - 4 - I / 13. We called that evening at the Soviet Vice-Consulate. The Vice- Consul, Solonln, was away In Tabriz, but we were received by the tw&lt; consular Secretaries^, ¥uradian, whose acquaintance I made last year and a new man, M. Alahverdieff, a Caucasian rauslim. K. Muradian. who 1 baa been some two years in Maku, wore a depressed air, but his colle- seemed more cheerful. J iscuss1ny the question of travel, V • Alla- hrdieff to .d us that he did not need to obtain a pass to travel about tne Consular District, but needed one if, for instance, he wanted *o go uo aeaaieh, which is a separate Busalan Consular District. Our conversation with them was on general and non-controversial topics - it is,in any case, hopeless to attempt to draw a minor Soviet offici al into any oiacussion of local conditions. But the effect of a long residence in .ialcu can be gauged by the fact that these Russians seemed genuinely pleased to see us, welcoming new faces, even reactionary ones, for their very rarity. J 14. as far as I could judge from one evening* s stay in the town, Maku was perfectly orderly and quiet. Hie police, smartly dressed in new uniforms, were alert and efficient. The Assistant i^a'rmandfir (also wearing a new unlfom) was greeted respectfully by the townspeople when ne walked with us. At the same time, the feeling that the whole population and most of the officials were living under a close and oppressive control was inescapable. A former Soviet Vice-Con 3 ul,hov&gt;- ever, once attributed the subdued appearance of the ifcku-ites to the oppressive influence of the enofmous overhanging crag that broods upon the town with something of an air of disapproval. lo.

The surface, ha;ever, will not survive next winter and the spring floods. l)rlef tour &gt; the first I have been able to moke this y*ar, nai enabied we to see for myself that Democrat control of this part e as elective as, from rex^orts I had received, I aad judged it to be. It has confirmed , too, the belief which I have previously based on my observations in Tabriz, that the system of control through secret police and supervisory bodies - whether local party Committees or Supervisory Councils within the frsmeworic of iiunicipal Government, is very efficiently organized. I felt a very r -ot difference in the province since my last journeys, undertaken during the insurrectionary stage of the “revolution^ in November and December last year. The undisciplined bands of partisans have dis appeared from th^roads, together with their barriers, and instead of them there is a close network of uniformed police and Fids* is keeping a strict control of all movement. They are no less uncompromising than the partisans, but one feels that they are under effective disci pline, and, within the limits allowed by their orders, they are correct and courteous. In general, after the turmoil of the insurrect- ionap' months, the provincial administration has emerged as something smarter, more efficient and far stronger than the did Persian admini stration. 17. The tour has also afforded me an orportunity to make the acquain uance of some of the Democrat officials. They are drawn chiefly, it seems, from the skilled stratum of the proletariat. The two officials with whom we had to deal at Julfa, for instance, told us that they had been convoy lorry driversi the ^rmandar of Khoi, who h^s just been transferred, was a garage worker, and the head of Security police at Jaku gave the impression ot being also one of this class of worker. / Inr. - i 5 t &lt;; &gt; ■&gt; In general, the democrat officials, v/hile they obviously have not the social graces of some of the old Persian officials, and have received perhaps little enough literary eduction, strike me as men much shrewdness and practical experience* they are interested in their own local affairs and are, I have no doubt, far more capable municipal administrators than the officials formerly sent from Tehran. But they are , above all, the type of men that the Prussians know eminently well how to handle. To meet them pronpts once more the re flection that the greatest weakness of the old Persian administration of the province was in not knowing how to make use of such men. it is, the Bussi-ns have used them for their own purposes, but these men themselves hove, in my opinion, clearly demonstrated that they car run this province more efficiently then I'ehran ever did; and, under neath the stock propaganda phraseology and slogans of their conver sation, I feel a genuine strain of local patriotism and enthueiesm which is not likelv, even without Uissian encouragement, to acquiesce In any attempt to restore the old conditions.

Copy With reference to my Despatch No. 2 of January 12th,, 1946, T have the honour to ^ive in the following paraffranhs an Anpreclation of conditions in this Consular District during the six months ended on June 30th. 2. The first half of this year has seen an interaction between world events and events in Azerbaijan such as can have occurred only rarely in the Province’s history. It is outside the scope of this Agreement to speculate what the Azerbaijan revolt may have contributed to the complicated pattern of relations between the Great Powers in a complicated post-war world, but to live in Azer baijan during these last six months has been to experience the conflict of great abstractions translated into the little facts of human life. ^ The crisis of the Council table, at the far end of its long cone of consequence, becomes © pin-prick* Great Britain and .tmerica uphold personal liberty against Russia’s ideal of compulsory two interpretations of Democracy meet in irreconcilable opposition - and the interpreters of one sort cut off the British Consul’s water, Russia disdainfully proclaims that her principles the lie to imputations of intervention — and the Consul breaks his car-springs in the furrows her tanks have goured in the face of Azerbaijan. 3 * n pie P^vacuatiori of Russian Troops. As Indicated in the concluding paragraph of my '^spatch under reference, no-one in Azerbaijanbelieved that the Russians would adhere to the letter of the Tripartite Treaty end evacuate the province by l arch 2nd, ^o-one was therefore surprised when Woscow Radio announced on March 1st. that Russian troops would remain in Azerbaijan rt until the situation was clarified'* - which was as straightforward an admission as one could desire that the Russians were not going to reduce pressure on this sensitive snot until they had got what they wanted from Tehran. The precise moves of Russian troops in the province at this period are no doubt known only to the Russian Ceneral Staff* but, from a great variety of reports and a good deal of direct evidence gathered in curious and sometimes uncomfortable wavs, it is reasonably certain that the Russians withdrew the bulk of their cavalry garrison from Azerbaijan during liar oh and substituted for it an armoured force of greater strength comnosed for the most part of troops newly brought frof:, Germany and Austria. This force, which perhaps amounted to a division, was at the end of £iarch deployed upon the southern and liastem ’frontiers' of Azerbaijan, i.e. in the regions of /ienjan and ^i«anduab. /hen J.H.

The agreement provided for the total evacuation of Russian forces within one month and a half from ±~arcU 22nd#, am the evacuation of As;erbaijan was carried out in a leisurely fashion during all tne month of April, the new armour ed forces being witndrawn alon# with such units of the old garrison as hau remained behind* ~y may 4th. all Azerbaijan was clear of boviet forces except for a detachment of tallies ana artillery which was held at labriz for a day or so to make a snow for the final ceremonial evacuation parade, on A«y 6 th. There was some delay even after this detacoment had left the town and it was not until ^ay 9 th. that the last uniformed husaian soldier was across the Aras river# The presumption all along uad been that though the un iformed troops would depart, Icey personnel would be left benind under cover of civilian employment or attached to the Azerbaijan army. It is almost impossible to obtain definite evidence bn this point, many suspected Russians turn out on enquiry to be ^uhajirs - none the leas useful to the boviet Authorities for that, - wnile the balance of the evidence suggests that the numerous instructors attached to the Azerbaijan Army early in the year were in fact withdrawn shortly before ^ay 6 th. It now seems improbaDle that, ii there was no need ior the Russians to maintain an army openly in Azerbaijan, they would find it necessary to maintain a large number of disguised troops or poltical agents here. There are plenty of Russian civilians in the Province, it is true, but the Hussians have also more tnan enough willing instruments in the members of the Azerbaijan National Government itself and in the *uhajirs, whose numbsre in the administrative departmenta increased coucuicuously this year. Guidance can, as always, oe riven by the Soviet consular Ofjleers. At tue end of June the Hussiaha still maintained at Tabriz a small party of their para-mllitary Hallway w or?G under the caiimand of a colonel. An Iranian railway oommission which ac companied the Tehran Government’s delegation to Tabriz in June was to nave taken over the labriz-Julfa railway but found it in so imperfect a condition that the handing over was held up pending an investigation, ^-hat at least is the ostensible re ?son for the Aus&amp;ians still keeping control of it. 4. iia&amp;uian. volley. The behaviour of the Huasians in Azerbaijan during the last six months, puzzliiig as it has been sometimes in detail, has not really diverged from the familiar pattern. Their troop movements in ^arch were probably prompted by uncertainty about the real intentions of Britain and America and the extent to which *avam, counting on British and American support, might prove axxx unaccomodating; wnile their apparent abandoning of the cause of Azerbaijan independence in ^ay and June will seem in consistent only to those who believed that they ever had any intention of openly annexing this Province. They have, at any rate, shown singular constancy in their pursuit of the Oil concession, though this may not be in itself the sole ultimate object for which they planned the revolt of Azerbaijan. The exclusion of other foreign interests from North Persia is an essential step towards Russian domination of the country, and the grant of the concession must in its turn, for some time at least, make for the continuance of a tight Russian control of Azerbaijan, for as the approval of the concession when the fifteenth mgjiig meets (*or in any case not later than seven months from March 24th. f ) depenus on a compliant majority in Tehran, so the creation of that majority depends largely on tive return of a solid, and increased, bloc of Democrat deputies from Verbal j an. /&amp;.Paragraph 3 or the agreement signed ^ by the Persian ^ rime minister and the soviet i^ahassador on April 4ttu stated that *ae the Azerbaijan question was an internal Iranian ail air, a peaceful settlement would be sought between the Central Government and the Azerbaijan people on the basis of the existing laws and in a spirit of solicitude for the welfare of the Azeroaijan people*♦ ^hile no reliable information about the con sultations between .avam and datchikoff on tais subject was available here, it was believed that a basis of settlement had been agreed between the two and that this basis was expressed by the *'riut© Minister 4 8 ’Seven i oint ^o.maunique ’ which was issued on April 25rd. The Azerbaijan democrat reply to this was simply that it was not enough* ^ut as the end was obviously foreordained the democrats accepted the ^mmunique as a basis for negotiation and a delegation headed oj Jaafar ^ishavari, the Azerbaijan brime minister, went to Tehran on April 28th. .tviter more ti*an a fortnight’s discusioa no result was obtained, r'ieriavari blamed not .avam but ’certain reactionary members of Ms Cabinet* lor this, it certainly seemed that someone in Tehran jibbed at playing the role assigned to him in this farce of negotiation, and it can scarcely have been Satchikoff or Qavatt or ^ishavarl who were presumably the joint authors of the piece. The Azerbaijan delegation, on its return to Tabriz, published the exchangee of draft agreements and, in commenting on trie negotiations# Tlshavari praised ^avam aiid did not strilce an altogether despairing note* A month later ( J une 11th.) a dele gation headed ay *rince ^usaflir Tiruz arrived in Tabriz and in two days had signed an agreement with daafar Tiahavari. A Governor-Gcmoral and heads of local government depart ments were i mediately proposed by the fraesidium of the Tabriz Assembly, as provided for in the Agreement, and accepted by Tehran. The Governor-General designate returned with Prince i'iruz to Tehran and was still there at the end of dune. 6 . Tae .rwv--.^t . The Agreement, on paper, represnts little if any loss of real autonomy to Azerbaijan. The taVx about complete Independence or separation was a red herring. The speeches and press articles of the democrats from the beginning show that their consistent claim was for ’local autonomy * within the framework of the A ranian state. Far from demanding separation from Jran, Aisnavarl more than once declared that if the demands of Azerbaijan were not satisfied the Azerbaijanis would go to Tehran and set up a liberal government there. The -’emocrats always claimed to be working for tne liberation of all Iran, and tae Russians, undoubted ly, were not going to break off a part if they could swallow the whole• The Agreement, as distinct from its interpretation - which remains to be seen - leaves the Azerbaijan democrats in as strong a position as ever. It concedes to Tehran the hollow ceremony of confirming in office the Governor-General and all other officials (except of the department of communications) chosen oy the Provin cial Council, but it leaves that body and its Araesidiua which is the real seat of power entirely in the Ge^oorats* hands, and it gives the Provincial Gouncil the disposal of 75;- of the Province’s revenues. The most important question of all - the Azerbaijan Army - had been settled, it seemed at the end of June, by being shelved, for up to that time there was no si-n of the mixed commission which is to decide tue details of the Army s organization. It is even possible that the matter will be deferred until the Fifteenth ^ajlis meets in order to make sure that findings of tne oo.uaission favour able to Azerbaijan are not rejected jy the Central Government. what ever tne eventual solution may be it is reasonable to suppose tnat it will be one which leaves the armed lores in Azerbaijan susceptible /to4* •^eiiiocrat ^arty inlluence. The Agreement proviaea for a similar comiission to deal with the volunteer x^ida 1 ! lorces who uill form the new gendarmerie. There is&gt; it is true, one article in the Agreement which may prove a faw from the democrat point of view: it is provided that the fifteenth ^ajlis shall pass a new law regulating the elections of Provincial councils and that when this lav; is Passed the present Azerbaijan Provincial Council (which is, of course, the old National Assembly) shall be dissolved and a new one elected on the basis of the new law. here taere is an obvious opportunity to limit the powers of the Azerbaijan local government by defining in the new law the functioxis of Provincial Councils, hut, again, the Agreement ensures as far as human foresight may that the '''ifteenth ^*ajlis will be sympathetic to Azerbaijan. 7. Activities of tae National d-pyernment . daafar ^ishavari resigned on eune 14th., for, by the conversion of the National Assembly into the Provincial council ( by changing its name),the Cabinet and prime Mnistership were abolished. The other Ministers of the national Government, with only one or two changes, substituted ‘ra^s* for Vazir* in their titles and carried on. it was too soon after the Agreement to judge, by the end of bune, whether Tehran would have any influence on local affairs through the Governor-General* meanwhile all the acts done in the name of the National Assembly retained their validity. «ithin one month alter the formation of the National Gov ernment a complete scheme of local government for the whole Province had been drawn up and approved by the Praesidium of the National Assembly, which gave it iorce of law (eanuary 8th). In each local ity (town, village, rural district) both an administrative and a supervisory council were created, the functions of the former being to do things and of the latter to see that they were done according to the Party line* Gince no-one but a democrat could posaibly be elected to the administrative council the supervisory council might seem superfluous, but the merits of the scheme have no doubt been demonstrated in similar conditions elsewhere* both councils are elected by universal adult suffrage, and all adult Azerbaijanis may stand for election. x he elections in all centres were held in the middle of January. The Agrement of Gune 15th. provides for the passing of a new municipal w ouncils law by the °entral ^ajlis and the Azerbaijan town councils will conform to this law. Until then, the present ones continue to function. The Agreement says nothing about the appointment of *'armandars anti bakhsndars (Governors and mayors of smaller towns) but the new Governor-General of Azerbaijan says they will be appointed by Tabriz. There were two plenary sessions of the National Assembly, one in February and the other late in Gune, at which a mass of social and economic legislation already passed oy the^raesidium and put into force received the approval of the people s represen tatives* much of this legislation was laudably enlightened, and pernaps the only measure which might be contested by the Iranian Government is that dividing the utate lands and certain big pivate estates among the peasants, though Havana as G a itaneh has recorded his intention to divide up ot a te -^ands over the whole of Persia at some future date, as regards private estates the Azerbaijan law sanctions the confiscation only of those belonging to declared 'enemies of the people' and there is a convenient loophole in tne machinery of appeal* ine Agreement of June 13th. confirms the distribution of Gtate lands and promises compensation lor other sequestrations, but it is silent about tne validity of otner legislation wiiich may affect Iranians outside Azerbaijan , such as the Azerbaijan customs regulations* Although six months is not long enough for much to be done in tne way of public wor’^s in a country where practically nothing /has-5- aad been doikj before, the ^eiaocrat adrainistration has given eoiae convincing inaio. tioxia 3 x an intention to carry out its oro^raauat# ^ promise to complete the railway between ^ianch and labrig is embodied (but perhaps entombed) in the Agreement; and at the end of dune the now u overnor-h €aei . a x announced from i'enran that he had obtained a contribution of one million tomans from the Shah’s privy purse for the provision of a water supply for Tabriz.

Ww of the first acts of the -I.Uonal Government was to pass a conscription law (macember Slst., 1945 ) but ± i &amp; i la vari thought it wiser not to put it into force until the Democrats were a littel firmer in the saddle. It was not publish ed therefore until February 7th., 1946. All male Azerbaijanis over the age of 20 - with exemptions for family reasons and previous service - were liaole to serve for two years, filing-up began from the date of publication and by the time of the Hussian^ evacuation about nine classes had been called to the colours, fhe ixuesiarm helped with instructors, equipment and uniforms and the People s nrmy in a very snort time not only looked tougher and more efficient than the old x ersian garrison cut was able to defeat the partisan enemies of tne democrats in tte Denjan, wain Galeh and *ara dagh areas, who, though composed, It is true, of untrained peasants, had in the Gouth at any rate the suoport of tne Iranian Army. , *-aiV of the People s ^iv^y officei a were WiUh jira, and, up to *.ay tth., no secret was made of Russian co-operation in training. Several Iranian officers who took part in the mutiny at -eshed last year arrived in ia^riz early this year and ware at once given high rank in the People s *rmy - two became generals. Dther Iranian deserters, perhaps to the number of twenty came in during the period under review, as did a few ^ir- x orce officers with two aircraft. ^ne aircraft crashed before reaching Tabriz, so that the total ateagth of the Azerbaijan Air-^orce at the end of dune was one machine• in addition to the arras capturca from the Iranian garrison last year, the People’s Army is well equipped with Persian Brno rifles and tom ay-guns supplied by the Musaiana. it was also sup plied with some light artillery, but the A utiS x anfi ^ 00ic back shortly before the evacuation, ita artillery now consists only of the few pieces which were forfaerly the property of the ^ranian garrison, ho tanks hove been seen in the hands of the Azerbaijanis, cut soldiers wearing tank-corps badges have been occasionally observed. A women’s unit was organized, with dress and equipiaent copied from the Russian - including side-arras. Fairly aucccssful eforts were made during these months to organize the volunteer bands of i? ida*is who had constituted the ' armed force of tne insurrectionary phase of the revolution but who, in the constructive phase,bc^an to be aoroething of a nuisance, individual partisans were relieved from failitar/ duties but allowed to retain their rifles and ordered to regain ready for active service at call, fue more or lees coherent companies were enrolled aa regular unite under the orders of the Ministry for the People *6 / Army6 - end given uuirorms end a promise of regular pay. fhey still, nowevor, retainea an independent outlook and in the villages (sometixaes in Tabriz itself) their captain acted as if they were the reel authorities in the land, if they are enrolled an bloc in the new gendarmerie the peasants are not g^ihx: to profit very much from having liquidated the old one* The Tida is began to show a certain surliness ae the negotiations with Tehran progressed, and in spite of jaedsls, uniforms and the flattering recognition which the conferring of tne title of ’Father of Fida’is’ on 1ishavari was Intended to convey, they may y^t cause trouble to the •‘-’eiaoerst authorities* In ^arch orders were issued placing the whole of the ■democrat Party on a military footing, so that besides the People’s Army and the *id&amp;'la there was created a third force of pert- tiiae soldiersi not very efficient ones, perhaps, but still more or less trained to handle rifles* 9. eporations* ^-ost of the action between Azerbaijan forces end 'reactionary* partisana took place beyond the borders of Azerbaijan proper, ^ne centre of anti-democrat resistance was, ho..ever, maintained for a snort tine by landlords in the ^ara ^agh , to the horth of iaoriz. This was wiped out in February* in the benjan area -ultan &lt;lxaed bulfiqari kept up a longer resistance, but in face of the greater numbers and better arms of the democrats his opposition and that of his associates further wouth petered out and by ^ay the democrats were in control of a wide zone of country running from the -forth of nenandaj and haiaadan to -enjan, where, no doubt, they would have hoped to overcome any Iranian attack before it reached Azerbaijan* contrary to what seems to h*&gt;ve been the belief of the Tehran press, it ia doubtful whether the Bemocrata ever x&amp;at in- texided to advance beyond this zone. They might have given a good account of themselves in defending Azerbaijan (with the iV ed Army behind then, of course) but they were never in any condition to a&amp;lly 3ut and conquer Tehran* The Iranian ^rime minister for his part discouraged action against the J emocrat8 and ordered the Iranian co uaanders on tae borders of Azerbaijan not to advance, in April a joint co uaission of x eoran and Azerbaijan officers was appointed to see that this stand-fast order was obeyed by both sides, and from then on there was peace broken only by one probably quite unfounded alarm on &amp;ay 19th. which roused the National Government to declare martial law in Tabriz* They recovered from their fright and abolished it the next day. 10. -^e^ocrat r a rt^ airs. The negotiations with x ehran appeared to set up bo ..e internal stress in the T*arty. Nothing of this was allowed to come out in public, but evidently one wing of the Party, led by Onulam ilhami, the Minister of finance, ^uhaamad ^iriya, the minister of education, and Ghulaia fahia ^aneshian, the deputy People’s Army minister, wanted to take a etro/iger line than Tishavzri* The diferehces were so acute that in June there were rumours of a plot against ^iehavari *a life. There may have been aoxiiething in this, for it was noticed that ^iriya began to be accompanied everywhere about this time by nis bodyguard - like two uneasy conaclenees, out the plot if there was one failed* i’isuavari w&amp;a picked for his job by the Auseiaiis and he stems to be one of the few good picks tney have made in Azerbaijan. n e is riot likely to lose the leadership of the * arty until the hues lane nave no further use for him. ^eanvnili tike arty must remain disciplined and ,ihited because it is tne essential meuium of control, and r ishavzri is a good pai&amp;y organ izer • ^ven before the Agreement the Party had begun to orepare /for- 7 - ior tiitt q lectiozxs to tiic ^iiand iarty laad^rs as aariy as April were touring tUe districts uiaKing campaign apeechoe just a© if tncjre had been an opposition to contend with at the polls, ^ucn conscientiousness in the void is slightly comic, but to omit it might have been thought too cynical, and cynicism is undoubtedly reactionary, fhe elections for tne '■'entral ^ajlis will oe as artificial a piece of play-acting as those ior the Azerbaijan national Assembly last years even the selection of this or the other ^arty member to go to fenran by tne ^entral committee has little importance when all public utterance is re duced to slogans and dictated formulae. under the provision for the increased representation of nzoroaijan in tht Central ^ajlis tne ' rovince will probably return fifty deputies. A x arty louth movement, modelled on the husaian , Pioneer 8 , , was started this year.

The prograjomes in Turki are relayed for the Tabriz townspeople over a network of loudspeakers, also left by the Russians# In an efirt to alleviate some of the misery of the lowest stratum, rescue homes for the destitute (bar ut farbia) were opened in Tabriz and other towns tnls year. !£• finance. * w eveaue was collected during the first six months oi the year at least as efficiently as it had been under the old regime. Dr. ^illspaugh , a income-tax law was enforced and con siderable arrears collected. « tariff of export dues was put into lores and the scheme of municipal tuxati m in ^abriz and other towns reformed to the advantage of the municipal revenues. A budget for the year 1325 (^arch, 1945 to March 1947), approved by the national Assembly in “pril, gave the total estim ated revenue of the province as 64,060,000 tomans snd the ex- • J nditure as 6o,856,; / •; uOmans, but the published figures were insuliiciently detailed to provide a reliable guide to the real financial state oi the -rovines. In February the National Government permitted the Azerbaijan crane nee of the National ^&gt;ank of Iran, the Agricultural mank and the uipah ^aak to resume limited operations, but drawings on individual accounts were restricted to one hundred tomans and all operations were supervised oy a committee including represent atives of tac ministries of *inane# and Trade. /Democratdemocrat policy under the National dovern&amp;ent aimed at financial as well as political local autonouiy. In dune the long projected Azerbaijan National ^ank waa opened, it was said to have a capital of five million tomans fully suoscribed by the Azerbaijan national Government, but at the end of the month its oificials were still a little V 8 t,ae about the legality of its transactions* it is not yet clear how the Agreeiaent will affect the financial position, ihe Geraocrats have scored two points in winning the right to appoint tueir own director of 1 'inance and to retain 75,. of the revenue for local expenditure (which is what they proposed last December), but obviously an intimate financial connection with Tehran must continue and what part an Azerbaijan National naiik can profitably play in the country’s economy is uncertain* The ’National currency’ which the Azerbaijan Government was rumoured to be issuing in march turned out to be simply ooupom of one to fifty tomans in value which could be exchanged against monopoly goods at the Government snops* 1'hey were really a device for paying Government servants partly in rationed goods instead of cash* 15 * frauc and inaajtr;/ * fhe National Government tackled the trade deadlock early in the year, and in February began to permit the export of .izeroaijan products under a scheme of licenses and export dues graduated to encourage the trade in carpets, skins, leather, dried fruits and tobacco, but to place a check on the export of dairy products and staple local food-staffs as part of an effort to reduce the cost of living* Licenses were granted only against undertakings by the exporter to bring the whole of the sale proceeds back to Azerbaijan, nut in practice many merchants found that an undertaking to return cash proceeds was not accepted* an equivalent value of imported goods was demanded* throughout these six months the Auasians bought and exported to Ausaift considerable quantities of w.-aat and livestock without, it seems, encountering atij such difficulties* In fulfilment of their pledge to protect and develop native industries and natural resources, the Government passed laws forbidding the Importation except under special licence of any kinds of ’industrial products’ which could be manufactured in Azerbaijan, arid requiring all Government servants to use only textiles made in Azerbaijan, haws for the encouragement of mineral exploration ana grants for prospecting were also discussed The Government took over one textile and one leather factory, tae ovuiers and directors of which nad fled to Tehran arid which v.ere on the ver^e of bankruptcy before the revolution* ^ut lack of funds, skilled hanas and managers and above all the lack of a market for the factories dear and shoddy products hampered this venture* In an attempt to reduce costs serious cute in workers * allowances were maue* The customary grants of fr^e clotaing, boots, bread and charcoal were xatitcc abolisned and in some cases cash wages wex*e reduced* nut some of the privately managed factories found it impossible to impose these cuts. employment during the period was, on the whole, better than before, chiefly because of the public works undertaken. A new habour was discussed by the ^raesldium, but at the end of June it had not been published* 14. cult are * Abundant winter and spring rains gave promise of a good harvest in most parts of the province, but no striking results of the Geiaocrats* agrarian policy are to be looked for tnis year. The division of Gtate lands has not materially in creased the area under cultivation, since many of the recipients of parcels of this land are too poor to provide seed and means of cultivation for more than taeir original holdings. Under tne /newnew land tenure law passed in April the landlord is obliged to lend aoney for seed and implements to the tenant, but this ^ responsibility is difiicult to fix as regards the State danda, while few, if any* of the big private landlords have obeyed the law. ain, through tne ua*illin 0 ne&amp;e of both laadlords and peasants to comply with the new law, part of the harvest this year may be wasted, ihe peasants, Having been given an extra inch under the new law are talcing an ell, while many landlords, afraid or re sentful, are refusing to collect their reduced share even when it is offered. a q the market is normally supplied with wheat by the landlords, not by the peasants who keep their share for domestic consumption and seed there is a possibility of a serious shortage in the towns this winter while quamitiea of wheat nay be left to rot in the villages where storage is moat inadequate. The new director of Agriculture (who held that post under the old Persian regime) is aware of tue daxiger and the local government may pos- sioly collect the landlords shares itself. • -rhs. . i’h uh National dov^rnment, formed in January under the leadership oi uazi -*oaamed, waged war during most oi the period under review againat the Iranian garrisons of -outh Kurdistan. i 1 hia campaign, with its promise of loot, prob ably much more than any common belief in the principles of democracy (as expressed by the Kurdish democrat ^arty) eerved to unite many sections of diferent tribes from as far north as Aa&amp;u, and rallied the Iraqi ^allah ^uatafa to the cause, as well as bri.iging in &amp;ama ^ashid from exile, ^‘he operations, which took place outside Aatrbaijan, wtdle they no doubt h?id the official sympathy of the National Government, roused little real enthusiasia here, 'i'here has, indeed, been a certain coolness between Gazi mohamed and tiie i'abriz authorities si-xce the beginning of the year, and it has looked at times as though there might be an open conflict over claims to such mixed districts as -dszaieh, -^hol and mianduab• nut it was obviously not in the Aussiane* interests to have a sub-civil war in Azerbaijan, and G a zi -shamed was probably told to kive way to the Tabriz democrats and seek expansion South wards where Aurdieh xiationaliam might be more useful. An agreement between the heads of the two National Govern ments was signed at faoriz on April 23rd.

The assumption last morfth wes that these tv;o events were interlocVinr parts of Russian policy, i.e. that the I^ussian troops were departing only a^ter the Soviet Government was assured that there wr» a cut and dried o^roer ett between the Central Government and A^erhai^an rivinr to the latter such concessions as would enable the Russians to maintain and expand their influence here and use ^?;e 'haija^ as their lever to heave the whole of I^an over to the Soviet si^e of the ^ence. Nothing has emerged here to disprove that such was the Hus si an a* intention and h-orte, but the tenth’s events su~ est that the assumption that the Russian plan was already achieved was perhaps bas^d on too h' eh an opinion of Sovi et diplomatic skill, for something, somewhere, seems to have come unstuck. Whether the break-down of the Aserbaijan-Tehran nerotiationvS was due to the realism of the Security Council or to the unexpectedly resurgent patriotism of some rersian politicians, who, like cats, fight best on their backs, is a luatter for speculation outside serbai,]an. here, though ^ishavari told the Party that he had come back ’empty handed 1 and appeared to indicate that we were back where we were last December, some ■ |propaganda is turned full blast to only honest man in the Tehran ^rovem- ’reactionary* merabe s of his cabinet and on the hidden hand of ’the foreigners’. ,-avam appears to be co operating in this manoeuvre and so it is not beyond the bounds of possibil ity that a re-shui 'led cabinet of ’honest men* in Tehran may shortly take up the negotiations with Azerbaijan once more, alternatively, as rumours here at the end of the month seem to indicate, Pishavari may urge bis cabinet to abate their demands. advance is discernable. Democrat build up ,ava: as-Dal tan eh as the ment, and all the blame is put n 65, The Russion Kvacnat 1 on, The Ited army left Tabriz with ceremony on the morning of fray 5th, About 180 trucks, of which less than PV v f ere carrying troops, some 30 runs of different types, 16 machine-^nin carriers, 8 amoured cars and PC tanka paraded down the main street an' 3 through a decorated arch out to the Julfa road. The column went all th* v-ay to Julfa by road, and for several days a^ter there were rumours that 1 1t had gone no further than Marsnd. The truth aeema to be that it was in fact halted by a broken bridge and did not cross the Area river until •‘•ay 9th, On ¥iay 5th., also, all hi-inrs in the town w^e evacuated *nd the barracks finally handed over to the Azerbaijan Army. The Azerbaijan Army took custody of moat of the private property which the Russiansfc® had occupied. By way 6th, the only uniformed 'fashions remaining in the town ware some six or seven member* of the para-military railway corps, Reports, which It was impossible to check by personal reconnaissance but which are believed to be true, indicate that all other towns of Azerbaijan were evacuated before May 5th, There is still no conclusive evidence that the itossians have left no war material behind in the hands of the /tzerbaij an Army, or, indeed, that they may not have some forces of their own still in the province, out the weight of the available evidence is against that belief, The case for believing that there is still Russian war-material in the province rests on statements of some -Azerbaijan soldiers and on the ’t that the People’s Army bas been using artillery and mortars against the Partisans bouth of denj an. Dut the soldiers* statements are not supported by any reliable eye-witness and may, moreover, may be inspired v for the purpose of bluffing Tehran, while the guns the Democrats are using in the South may be those captured from the Iranian garrison here last December. r fhe People* s Amy was undoubtedly supplied with artillery by the Russians and used it gaily for practice during April,.but no-one has seen any of it since the last week in *&lt;nril f while, on the other harv'T* there are reports too numerous and circumstantial to be wholly discounted that the whole of this artillery was handed back to the dussisns a few days before the evacuation. V \ / / The same applies to Soviet military Instructors* there, were aboutI . of these aot-cnua t,o Uie ^zerbaijen a eople* s ^my and four more at one ; ilitary College. But all were withdrawn at the beginning of *ey. There is a possibility, of course, that soue of then re-attached the; - selves in the t ;uise of i uhojirs, but there is no proof of this. Yet Russians reiiiuin in the town, ^-n estimate of U)e numbers is not possible, but there are probably twenty or thirty ex-officers, for the oak part Caucasians, who have acquired jobs with such Russian concerns • $ Iran so v rang Transport Company and the Iron so vn eft (Oil dis- trib^ing Company). 1 oreover, the retention of Russian railwaymen here provides good cover, end there is reason to believe that the Traffic 3 upe &gt;intendent, Colonel Ahviedoff, is saner intending other thinrs than railway traffic.

Azerbaijan-Tehran Re oti&amp;tions. Ihe Democrats became uneasy when the negotiations at Tehran aragged out through the first two weeks of ^ay and oegan to bombard their relegation with telegrams telling them not to yield a step. These telegrams* signed by all the wealthy erchonts ?• lanclords of Tabriz, as well as by ullahs, intellectuals and others, were for the most part re-drafted after signature by a Party propagandist in the Telegraph Office. The acting Prime -Inist°r, ^r. Javid, the * inicter of Jnance, obulam Reza Hhami, the Minister of education, Rohamed Biriyp and other* members of the Cabinet and Party toured the ^aumes 1 (Party district Headquert nd made encouraging speeches. It was noticed in these meetings thet the only people to display a fighting spirit were the Muhajirs. On bay 13th. the Azerbaijan ^el crf«tion returned hy air npd the *ame evening Pishavari gave an account of the proceedings st Tehran to » resting of the Party. His speech was translated Into Persian and broad- t. The s of drmfs mgreeaieRte between • av ■ were published in the nress here on 1-ay 17th. with favourable co ments or t v e acco tod at in g spirit v.avar had shovn. The Azerbaijan ^ election apparent ly did not consider its terms -eference to amly to Azerbaijan alone, but ds«»8nded reforms of local government for the whole of T'an. Its t draft of thirty-five articles of agree? ant would, in fact, have given the rtze'‘hatjan National Gov»mrr:ent mo^e power than it already enjoys. In thp cinal draft the demands v;ere reduced, and the nzerbeijsnis showed the - selves willing to compromise over matters of form* to accept the title of Provincial Council for the National Assembly and Head of Department ^or inister - to yield, that is, the sorublances of power, but not the realities, as some democrats had forecast, the **elegfotion would not .agree to the appointment by Tehran of either the Govemor-Ceneral or the co toanuant of troops, and on those two snags the negotiations were hung up. In his staten'ent to the Party here Pishavarl implied that 4*vam would have agreed to the demands of i»zerboijan, but M certain opposed and un co-op- rative elements in ^avam f s i -*ablnet , ‘ stood out against thew. i'ishavari, it appears, is re dy to negotiate again, meanwhile, Azerbaijan ministers «nd press put out the usual valiant stuff about defending their freedom to the last drop of blood if Tehran resorts to force, which is perhaps as good an indication as any that it is under stood that Tehran will not resort to force. At the end of the tionth there were strong namours that s delegation headed by luzaffar Firuz was on its way from Tehran to resume the ne- otiations here. Pishovari is believed to have addressed s aretlnr of the Party and told them that some com”omise was inevitable.

He is a a id to be a Jir and tl murderer of the Tabriz police officer Vakiii who was shot in the street shortly before the Democrats seised power last Decambar. Hilal Nasir, formerly p^of inent in the old Freedom Front, but of whoru little has been he ; rd lately, has been appointed Farm and a r (Governor) of Hesaieh* 72. Trade and Industry. business la still very slack, about the only cob taodlty in which there is any dealing being carpets, which are being bought for the Tehran and /^ericon markets. The Russians are selling sugar, but the local market is well stocked and prices are down to Rls.40-42 per kilogramme for loaf and dl 3 .28-35 for soft sugar (wholesale). ‘The National Government have made efforts to fix the prices of locally produced food-stuffs, part of their campaign to reduce the cost of living. The chief result so far is that products like butter have become unco -only scarce. The Goveniment have opened two big wholesale shops for the s' le of sugar, tea and cotton piece goods. On May loth, the Government published a law prohibiting the importation into Azerbaijan of all clashes of ’industrial products* which are produced in Azerbaijan. The penalty for a first o^erc« is a fine amounting to half the value of the goods imnort^d and for a sec on i o ^ ence, the confiscation of the floods. The rh^ese ’indus trial products* is not defined.. The aama lasr requi-^ aXI fa yam employees to use only textiles produced in Azerbaijan.

Goods prohibited under the first nart of this law ray be imported in exceptional cases if the inietry of economics and Co merce certifies their importation to be esrentiai. The National Government faced v/lth the problems both of 'educinr the cost of living and running the factories they h- ve taken over, arc beginning by docking the factory workers* allowances, whereas under the old regime every factory worker was provided with free bread and charcoal as well as with two suits of clothes and a pair of shoes in the year, now ha is to receive his bare pay, with, perhaps ito some cases, one suit of working clothes. The factory workers are not liking it, ouu, as it is thexir erstwhile cham v ions, like ^ohatned 3 iriy 3 who are now in power, there is little they can do about it. strikes, of course, are out of the question under a A&gt;8uocrat regime. xjubl ic ,„orks, Repair of Tabriz streets has gone ahead all thr( the month, ^ne street has been asphalted and extensive relaying of cobbles is in progress in many others. The National Government are undertaking the rehabilitation of the pleasure resort of Ghah Goli, about 5 miles from Tabriz which has been neglected and in ruins since the Occupation in 1941. The Osd to it has been mended, trees planted and the repair of the ^staurant is well advanced. Sat tar Khan, the hero of the 19QG revolution, ha? finally gap- planted fez a :liab as the tutelary genius of thie city. Hie bu*t, 'inrr the from th. X.t. Shah', atatua h a rt baan-5- re oved wa unveil gI during the r onth and the puhlle garden hs&lt;! be&lt;&gt;n renamed after him # 74. Rezaieh. The situation in Rezaieh is not easy. An i»z^^b^.ijan Dr ocret ndriinistrnti is in cental o ' the tovm, the majority of vhose population is 1 aja» # i.e. Turki sneaking Az &gt;rbaijani muslii s. According to a reliable British in^ortf^nt vfho visited the town ^uting Kay, the adrr inistrstion is vorking ^alrly efficiently, but the Kurds are ri ing it no support. It is probable that th^ Oe ocr^t nd? inistrstion* s -rit loes not run very far in the surrounding country. «broover, there ar« signs that n tive opposition to Democrat rule is a little mo e articulate than it Is in Tabriz. To-ards the end of the month a number of school boys and young men ere r- &gt;’ested for sticking anti-Nstional Government handbills on the r ails, and one of the particin»nts in this activi y has declared th &lt;t the opposition is organized as in underground p-'irty in cells ith only a single individual co tunica ting between any two. This man, a young ex-Iranian police off'icer, claims that the party can -count on four thousand armed men to rise against the ijeuiocrats when the time is ripe. It forces would seem to oe collected in villages on the outskirts of riezaieh. But the cletai is no doubt highly exaggerated. Nevertheless, Nezaieh, r ith its ancient traditions of communal s :rife and petty warfare, is by no means an easy place for any one party to hold do -i! i. padegan, the vice-Gh irman of the Deocrat p.:rty&gt; w«os sent to Rezaieh at the end of the month to investigate the situation. 75. Kurdi^i ^ 'reirs. It was noticeable in the published record of the Azerbai,)an-Tehran negotiations, in \*hich a Kurdish delegate took part, that Kurdistan was r ferred to throughout as Azerbaijan Kurdistan’ , i perhaps an indication that the Azerbaijanis are unwilling to recognize complete separation. at the same time, recognition as an indeoen' «nt govcmmont seems to be accorded to the Kurds in the agreement r rched between them and the Azerbaijan national Government on *rril °3rd. which n* publ ished on Kay 5tb. In this, the Kurdish Gove^nr ent is r f erred to as the National Government ©f Kurdistan. The Kurdish Delsgatl n hich negotiated and ^gned this agreement consisted of Gazi uhhmmad, Sey^^id Abdullah Gilani, Omar Khan -harifi (Cihief of the Shakkak) , uharrrad Hussein Seif Gazi (Kurdistan people 1 s Army minister, who represented Kurdistan in the Tehran negotiations), Rashid Beg Jehongiri of the HerVis, Aero Beg 3abaci ri also of the Kerkis (the notorious bandit of the Baranduz valley) and Gazi i.uhamad Khanazi, described as a representative of the Kurds of Ushnu. The agreement provides th-^t epresentatives \ ill be exchcini ed between the two governments ’’ ..here necessary” I that in those parts of Azerbaijan which are inhabited by Kurds the latter will be given a sh ;re in the administration, and so for Azerbaijanis inh Siting ivurdistam that a joint iic nomic Gommias- ion wi 1 be set up* that the militar forces of the two governments will co-oper te at needl that any negotiations v ith Tehran will be undertaken jointly* that each government will give facilities fbr the development of the national culture of the others citizens and that the two governments will take joint action against any persons lio attempt to disturb the harmony and friendship exi ting between them. There is no attempt in the agreement to define the boundaries of 'Kurdistan” and ^ Azerbnijan ,, , but presumably the second article is an attempt to ot over this difficulty, and may mean that towns such as Rezaieh, 2£ifinduab and perhaps Khoi vhile under the sovereignty of Azerbaijan, will have a mixed Azerbaijani and Kurd a (to inis tr at or. The unity of the Azerbaijan Kurds the selves is do btful. There ar-» ru ours that the powerful Hkhanizadeh family of the Oehboukri tribe in the Bukan region have been In arms againstGajgi ££uha mad and the Kurdish National Government. Sven if this is not true» the animosity between the Ilkha iaadehs and Gazi Muhlimmad is no secret. Meanwhile, the He ''a i eh and K&gt;ioi Kurds are said to have eyp^ssed the st^on^est object Ions to bei T&gt; j? ruled by Mahabad, and Gm : r Khan| it ivS r^orted, swears that he will naie in Sulduz and Ghahnur and that any lahabadi official will cross the Gadar Chai at his neril. Some measu^^ of co-oneretion aronr the chiefs m*y f all the same, b» expected if the prospects for a profitable action against the Iranians are ^ood. There has be*n considerable ovem&lt;n t of Kurdish bands south from Razaieh durinr the month and there ar» ruu-ours of a renewed attack on S rdasht being planned. If there is any truth at all ^n a story beinr told in Tabriz this attack may already have be^n made and defeated. The stbry roes that Gazi ^iohamed vi^a' in com. unication with a Kurdish o 'ic^r n the Iranian /irmy, adjutant to General .ihshbakhti at Sardaeht. He vrote to this officer demanding information on the dispositions of the Iranian troops. Shahbakhti intercepted the letter and caused the Kurdish officer to reply, giving certain dispositions and suggesting a plan and route of attack for the Kurds. The Iranian forces were then di ose in ambush. The Kurds swallowed the bait and on the night of 18th attacked along the line suggested - 14,Guo of them, the story goes. They suffered a crushing defeat, losing 8,GUO men. This so alarmed the Ge ocrat outpost at Baghche -i he, whose com ander supposed he ould be the next objective, that he sent off the report mentioned in P; ra 69 above, which led to the imposition of martial law in Tabriz. Those viho r late the story aver in support of it that four lorry loads of wounded ivurds wer brought into Tabriz. A Kurdish contingent of heavily gold-braided officers came to Tabriz at the beginning of the month to s&lt;*e the BusFians off. Gazi i'uhamraad did not wait in Tabriz to velcome Pishavari back from Tehran, but his representative, Self O zi, was still here at the end of the month* M. Nanoleon Jeki^l, director of the F^ance-P^es^e n«wa agency in Tehran, ^ho ha«i spent most of the month in Azerbaijan, found ouch favour with the Kurds here that he was invited to make a t^ip to M&gt;babad. He did so and a^par^ntly the Azerbaijan Democrat authorities made no object on. On Ms return he produced some | staggering statistics of the flea population of Mahahad, ith all of which he claimed to have bee &gt;me personally acquainted during his stay. But he vmn reticent bout his other con acts. The Kurdish National Government have a project for refitting the hospital at Mahabad, but v/ork does not seem to be advancing very .eil* T’.vo builders, an Armenian ^nd ^3 -.luslim ho era engaged in Tabriz so e time ago, have returned and said they /tver unable o agree on terms ith the Kurdish authorities. 76. British Interests . The *iv lo-Iranian Gil Co papy has been renuested to Inc vqqs e the i,.uniclpal dues payable on its sales in c rtain towns. It is not possible to ascertain whether the same demand has be&lt; 2 n made to the Russian Gil wO-pany. The British Gompany has agreed. No ad inistrative aifficulties have been put in the way of i*r. Levis, the British official of the Go any who has been inspecting the Azerbaijan br nches of the a. 1.0*C., but at Hezaieh he was regarded yith grave suspicion by th local Democrat autho^d.ties and followed everywhere by members of the political police. The Hezaieh manager w«a interrogated ^fter his departure and his servants arrested e en before his departure. i£r m Lewis has nevertheless formed the opinion that it is not the intention of the Democrats (or Hussiins) to squeeze the British Company out of this province. 77.

The prohibition on Con uls* movements does not, apparently, apply to din^ct joume r s to Tehran. The Dei ocrats* tre traent of the British and U. 3. Consuls is, of course, a reflection of the resentment they feel at vhat they suppose to be Briti^i and American support for the Tehran ' eact ion&lt;jries M in the Security Council, pishavari is aware of the propaganda value of correct behaviour, but he either cannot check the ualice of his colleagues or cannot resist the temptation to inflict petty annoyances which ho can ait rwards saooth over with an apology. &lt;« typical instance was the publication during the month by the Azerbaijan ne^vspaper of a ridiculous but malicious story of the meric an Consul’s h-ving tried to bribe a policeman at the telegra h office. 78. Press and Propa^ nc^a. After Ion- silence, much news has gone out 0 ? Azerbaijan thi- lo^t ' onth. Tabriz radio, which broadcasts in Turki, Persian and French, ivS hea^d in London a* *'rell as in T^h-^an. Abo\it the middle of the tronth 46 % Goodwin of the ns '-ociated Press and Mr*. Souki of the United arrived in Tabriz *nd have despatched a number of articles. The Democrats seem to hav* be^n annoyed at their arrival, accused tb^. in th * nevs&gt;paner of photographing military subjects anf' c anned tbem that they tpuI’ be considered as soles, and no T'esr'meibility would be taken for anything that happened to the • Th«se tvo corussnondents not able to travel about the province, but being, with K. Jekiel, the first foreign correspondents (other than i^ssian) to enter Azerbaijan since 1941, they hav* found the journey ficiently rewarding. Their visit has, however, coincided ^ ith (perhaps stimulated) some violently anti-*nerican articles in the Azerbaijan press. Great Britain and Turkey are castigated en passant, but the U. S. is na-r he major villain of the piece. 79• 7lcoory Celebration. The Irano-Soviet Cultural Society held a meetiMon^SyytirrTo celebrate the Victory over the Axis.

Ai riculture . On Api*il 15th. the text of a nev/ law regulating the division of crept between landlords and tenants w's published. It appears to be a praiseworthy tleant to bring some order, unifor ity and justice into the ch ro a of 1 end-tenure in nzerbaijan# Ihe law enunciates the principle thst rope to be shared in a ra io based on the ovr^ership of the several means of production aero ’ding to the trcport^nce of those means in ea h type of cultivation. Ihus separate shares of the produce are allotted fer ovsiershlp of land, labour, voter, seed and imrlaments. For rain the proportion i e* labour, 3 shares! lanr%2 shares? liplements, 1 share and (orests?ably) se^d, 1 sha^e. The landlord therefore .^ets one seventh o^ the harvest and the cultivator sir sevenths. (The old svstem vhe^eby the landlord o^ton p v v&gt;vided th? ?e?d is abolished, hut the len' 1 - lord is under obligation to lend ^oney for seed an^ i r&gt;l«m«nts to those peasants who can ot afford thf^i). For c^ors o~oduced on land irrigated by natural streams and srhinrs the proportions arc* labour, 5 shares? implements, n shares; lan one shekel water, one share and seed, onshor*ej th?3s 'dving the landl ord here he owns both land and * voter t 'O tenths of the c-^p. For crop? ir rigated by artificial canals the hares are* labour, 5t implements, ?; seed, li ter, 3? land, 1, giving the landlord 4/12 of the harvest. Provision is made for the division of other cr\&gt;ps, such as fruit, on the same principle and there ere also regulations for the sharing of hay anc lover crops and the use of pasture lands. nil minor dues in kind fo merly exacted by landlords (butter, eg s, fowls, etc.) are abolished. The 1 ndlord cannot call on th« peasants to transport his share of the croi, b t the responsibility for cutting, threshing or otherwise recessing the crop is upon the cultiv tor, end he is to be given of the harvest before division as recompense for his labour in harvesting it. Supervision of the harvest, its division end all metiers regulated by this law will be exercised by village com ittees composed of from three to five men eleetef by the com unity. Disputes within the committee win be erred to the Ministry of Agriculture which has the norer to order ne’ elections if nece ^sary. 59. K urdifh Affairs . Few reports from Kurdish sources have re ch@d Tabriz of^tne ^i.c* ting between Kurdish Repu d icon forces and Ii*«rian troops et S&gt;srdasht. But it 1 ccame generally known during the month that the Kurds had had the orst of it and there T ' r as even a rumour that a delegation of c leffe had crone to Saqqi* to negotiate with the Iranians. /GaziGazi iiohawed hnr’ 3 pfoo^ d^^il of time Iti Tabriz sn^’ thf* to’Ati hee b&lt;rn full of Kurds, including *my of tb-i conspicuous 35:a'desk rbo arv^ normal' y in frefiuent ■vir irons.

Ihe Kurdish cl^iais ust, of course, be taken into consideration in the discussions now proceeding betv;een the Azerbaijan government and the Ira ian prime Minister* Ihere ivS no recent news of the situation in hezaieh* there seems to be an agreement on both sides to leave t&amp;b tiers in sus pense there until the xoissians have mrsde their final wishes kno n through the settlem^snt which will presumably be reached in Tehran* Tabrirr radio station was officially inrugureted on /^pril f?th. and Go si *.ohamed broadcast a short ad rcss, giving the information that a daily time would be allotted to the ‘ ! urds, end pledging Kurdish support for the Azerbaijan Oecocr^Ts. another Kurdish speaker in a brosdesst talk had already rut the noint of view of the Kurdish Republic • We ha ’e hi her to been an agricultural people, he announced, but now we intend to industrial i ze ourselves and defend our autonomy to the last d-w)p o^ blood. 60- Armenian affairs, a delegate from «|T*iven is said to have pas -ed th-ourb Tebris a^out the iddle of April for Tehran in connection cith the Armenian emigration scheme.

According to Pishsvari the asphalt has • t lready b zn obtained, but there is no engineer v^ho knows hoto put it &lt; 5 own. Experiments are to be made. 62. Pubiic ^ecuri y . One Hussian soldier vv:s killed and two v ounced by yids» is acting as auxiliary police on the ni^it of /&lt;pril 2bth. fno soldiers, it seems, were in a drunken brawl v ith a cab-driver an &lt; assaulted the ^ida’ is when they intervened. Guch incidents have been rare since the Democrats vSeized power. Their police dispositions are on the whole good. Considering the large nuoiber of lethal weapons tha- acf ca-Ucil^y waved snout all the time in streets, caf£s and public places, the , number of times they ro off 1 - surprisi gly small. It is probably due to o^t of the cartridges not fitting. 63. British Interests.

The aim of the Tudeh party was to reduce to a minimum the authority of the Tehran Government in Azerbaijan, the practice of the Kussian authorities, adjusted to this aim, was to prevent any strengthening of the local administration by the appointment of more competent and patriotic officials. 3. Even in Persia it is possible that a weak local administration might in certain circumstances be bolstered up by patriotic and public-spirited local citizens. Thus, in Azerbaijan, the Persian Government might have found strength, first, in an organisation of merchants and manufacturers in some anti- Tudeh party and, second, in the combination of wealthy landlords whose interests were threatened by the Tudeh-Democratic movement. The Democrats were well aware of these dangers and took the initiative. By a little terrorism and a lot of threats and bluff they frightened the townspeople‘out of any attempt to combine in a “ reactionary Seyyid Zia party.” When necessary they could always count on Russian support to secure the expulsion of persons likely to be active in such combinations, because such persons could always be “ proved ” to be inimical to Russian interests. By August 1945, there had been enough of such expulsions to convince everyone that there was no hope whatever of forming an anti-Tudeh party. At the same time a campaign of terrorism was being carried on against the landowners and had reached its height at harvest time, when the Tudeh weapon of withholding rents in kind could most effectively be brought to bear. This campaign also was a complete success and served a double purpose : it robbed the Persian Administration of the potential support of the landowners, and it freed and emboldened the peasants on whom the Tudeh-Democrat party counted as forces in the next stage. 4. The Administration thus isolated was powerless : it could make no regulations and undertake no activity which had not the approval of the Tudeh- Democrats. It was headed, not by a substantive Governor-General, but by an acting official whose avowed purpose was simply to keep the wheels on the cart as long as he could and to get out when he couldn't. An attempt to substitute a substantive Governor-General, Mehdi Farrukh, for the acting official, AbuT Path Nikjou, was frustrated by a violent Democrat press campaign and by a plain statement of the Russians that they would consider his appointment “ provocative.” 5. By December the work of undermining the Persian Administration had left only two main props still to knock out : the gendarmerie and the army. Of these, the former was the stouter. Its role in Azerbaijan, besides keeping'order in the country places, had been quite openly to assist the landowners in collecting rents and disciplining their peasants, whose condition approximated more nearly to that of serfs than tenants. The peasants could therefore be counted on to give their support against the gendarmerie as they had in general given it against the landowners. The army, like the civil administration, had been efficiently »»»_ V r ■ u neutralised by the Russians, who, by the res its movements, [74—177] Bn 2 practically confined it to barracks in its garrisons of Tabriz, Rezaieh, Mianduab, Marageh, Sarab and Ardebil. It was certain that they would not allow it to interfere with the Democrats’ plans. 6. Hence the Persian Administration’s only hope of resisting an attack lay in receiving reinforcements from outside the province, just as the Democrats’ only hope of carrying out their plan quickly and easily lay in preventing such reinforcements. This was the crucial act of the campaign, and one in which the Russians could no longer act through the Democrat party : they were forced themselves to come out and stop the reinforcements sent by 'the Tehran Govern ment at Kazvin. Thus, while ensuring the success of their policy, they were obliged to admit, in spite of all the camouflage with which the act was daubed, that the destruction of the Persian Administration in Azerbaijan was in fact their policy. 7. By successive stages between the 16th November and the 18th December the props were knocked out from under the Persian Administration : its ruins were quickly swept away or incorporated in the new edifice and a “ National Government of Azerbaijan ” assumed control from the 12th December, the day when the National Parliament of Azerbaijan met in Tabriz and all Govern ment offices were taken over. The new Government, while claiming not to act to the detriment of Persian integrity and sovereignty, exercises in practice an authority wider than is usually understood by the term “ local autonomy,” and is at present, while no settlement with Tehran has yet been reached/ for all practical purposes, an independent State. Formation of the National Government. 8. The leaders of autonomous Azerbaijan are in the main “Old Liberals,” that is to say, men who held and expressed Communist or Socialist principles in the time of Reza Shah, were imprisoned for them, or fled to Russia, and emerged into public life again when Reza Shah was overthrown at the time of the Allied occupation in 1941. The leaders themselves are not “ muhajirs ” (immigrants from the Soviet Union), but several of them have spent periods in Russia. They are all ex-members of the Tudeh party, and, with possibly two exceptions, they are all men who in a free election, if such a thing were possible in Azerbaijan, would receive few if any votes from their fellow townspeople. 9. I here are possibly two reasons for the reorganisation of the pro-Russian party which took place in August. One is that the Tudeh party had gained a reputation for violence and corruption and subservience to the Russians; the other is that it was led by men whom the Russians probably did not trust to carry out the final stages of the campaign. In the reorganisation these men (notably Ali Amir Khizi) were dropped. The first reason carries little weight in Azerbaijan, but the reorganisation, and especially the use of the name “ Democrat party,” possibly seemed to the Russians to have a good propaganda value abroad : though it has never seemed to people in this province that the Russians cared much for world opinion. The new Democrat party made an appeal to all classes, and tried to show that it was moderate, non-violent and patriotic. It was never, however, a political party in the Western sense : it assumed from the first the right to be the only party in the country, and to express alone the will of the people of Azerbaijan. It was a party in the Communist sense—an instrument for putting into effect a plan decided by a minority in the name of the people, for what the minority conceived to be the good of the people. 10. The Democrat party immediately absorbed all the old Tudeh party except, as it claimed, opportunist and irresponsible elements. The Tudeh party of Azerbaijan abolished itself by a self-sacrificing act on the 17th September. The Democrats published a declaration of policy like any other political party, but their main efforts were directed to organising themselves for the coming overthrow of Persian authority. During September and October committees of the party were organised in all the provincial towns and larger villages and in the first half of November arms, procured and distributed with Russian aid, were served out to party members in the zone chosen for the first attack. 11. In two days, the 16th and 17th November, the gendarmerie was over powered and control assumed by the Democrats in a zone stretching from Sarab, through Mianeh to Mianduab, cutting across all the lines of communication between Tabriz and the rest of Persia. The telegraph to Tehran (and the rest of the world) was cut, and all traffic on the roads strictly controlled. The Persian army garrisons in Ardebil, Sarab, Marageh and Mianduab were isolated andoutnumbered, and the Russian military authorities, while not absolutely for bidding the Persian general in plain terms to send reinforcements, made it quite clear that he could look for trouble from them if he did. The forces used in this insurrection were peasants armed with rifles and stiffened by “muhajirs ”— immigrants from the Caucasus, many of whom have seen service in the Red army, and all of whom are completely under Russian influence. During the next week the region north-west of Tabriz, including the towns of Marand, Khoi and Maku, was similarly brought under Democrat control. These first conquests were made without much resistance by Persian troops or gendarmes, who, as soon as they surrendered, were disarmed and disbanded; but there were a number of isolated murders of gendarmes, civilian officials and landlords. 12. The party’s political plan was geared to the insurrection. As soon as the gendarmerie were cleared from eastern Azerbaijan a National Congress met in Tabriz (the 19th November), composed of 650 delegates from all parts of Azerbaijan. This congress adopted a declaration which appealed to the five great democratic Powers to support Azerbaijan’s claim to local autonomy “ within the Iranian State.' It also elected a provisional local government in the form of a “ National Committee ' of thirty-nine, which was charged with arranging the elections for a “ National Parliament.” This was the first open announce ment that the Persian local government had been definitely superseded. The elections began on the 28th November and ended on the 1st December. The day they began Tehran’s last choice for a governor-general for Azerbaijan, Murtaza Bayat, arrived in Tabriz. He had instructions to offer wide reforms and a programme of public works, but, of course, matters had gone far beyond the point where any palliative measures might have had an effect. There was never, indeed, any question that the Democrats—or more accurately, the Russians —would allow their plans to be altered by anything Tehran could do, and it was at least six months too late for any official from Tehran to entertain hopes of raising local opposition to the Democrats. Bayat did not encounter the same violent opposition which had kept Farrukh away : the Democrats were strong enough to carry on as though unaware of his existence, and to leave him and his aged lieutenant, Mubassir Roshani, to make themselves faintly ridiculous with a proclamation offering to negotiate “ with all parties.” Bayat did have one or two interviews with members of the National Committee, but they refused to discuss any modification of their plans. Towards the end of his brief stay here, too, the Democrat press took notice of him in an article couched in the firm but not unkindly tone in which a child might be told to run away and play. 13. The elections were staged in the Russian manner: there was no opposition to the Democrat candidates, but to each list was added a number of ” non-party ” names, for which, of course, no one was expected to vote. There was universal suffrage over the age of 20, but as there was little pretence of secrecy in the ballot, and as, in any case, the polling booths were run and the votes counted entirely by party members, the number of votes announced as cast did not necessarily bear any definite relation to the number of persons who actually entered the booths. The total number of votes which the party announced as being cast in Tabriz corresponded to a tenth of the population. Twelve Deputies were elected for Tabriz, and every useful member of the party was assured of a seat somewhere. 14. The Parliament of 100 members thus elected met in Tabriz on the 12th December. In the week that had elapsed since the end of the elections the party’s military movement had kept pace with the political development: party members in Tabriz had been armed with rifles and pistols, and the volunteer riflemen (fidia’is) from the province were concentrated in the immediate suburbs of the town to the number of several thousand. Simultaneously with the opening of the Parliament, the armed forces closed in and took over all the police stations, the gendarmerie headquarters and the local government depart ments. There was some firing but no casualties, for the surrender had been most probably pre-arranged. The Persian military garrison in Tabriz surrendered two days later without resistance. Immediately the party, or the National Government as it had now become, proceeded to reduce the last remain ing centre of Persian authority—that in western Azerbaijan. Here, the Persian Commandant and Acting Governor-General at Rezaieh unexpectedly took the initiative, and in a three days’ attempt to forestall the Democrat attack permitted his gendarmerie to shoot at sight any known or suspectdd Democrats they encountered 1 . The Democrats, actively aided by the Russian military authorities, assembled all available transport and brought in such reinforcements that, on [74—177] • b 24 the 18th December, the Itezaieh garrison capitulated, to be followed a few days later by those still remaining in eastern Azerbaijan, and the whole province was then completely in the hands of the National Government. Composition and Policy of the National Government. 15. The Azerbaijan Cabinet, headed by Jaafar Pishavari as Prime Minister, is composed of ten Ministers: the Interior, the People's Army, Agriculture, Education, Health, Finance, Justice, Roads, Posts and Telegraphs, A Trade, Labour. Four of these posts—(Education, Finance, Justice and Roads—are filled by men who have played a prominent part in Tudeh- Democrat activities ever since the occupation. The other Ministers, though all party men, are not such well-known public figures. Of the whole Cabinet the only two of any noticeable ability are the Prime Minister and the Minister o'f Education, Mohamed Biriya, who is also chairman of the Azerbaijan Trade Union and has shown some organising ability and force of character in that capacity for several years. His, principally, is the task of carrying through the change from Persian to Turki as the official language. The Minister of Finance is the one time Mayor of Tabriz, Ghulam Reza Ilhami, a hypocritical, untrustworthy character whose ability is as doubtful as his honesty. He is at present showing a great deal of boastful and bullying energy in collecting taxes. 16. The Government’s policy as announced by Pishavari on the 12th December is naturally first to establish securely Azerbaijan’s autonomous status. It proposes to do this by broadening the basis of administration by electing regional and town councils to carry on local government, by making the Turki language the one official language of Azerbaijan, by raising and equipping a modern army and by seeking recognition of Azerbaijan’s status among the Great Powers. In domestic policy it promises a reform of land tenure equitable to both landlords and peasants, the extension and improvement of public health services, the development of industry and trade and the modernisation of com munications. It guarantees respect for private property and for the rights of racial and religious minorities. Relations with the Central Persian Government. 17. These at present do not exist. The Persian Government has so far shown no sign of recognising the Azerbaijan “rebels'' and the National Government for its part abuses the “reactionary” Government in Tehran, accuses it of trying to strangle Azerbaijan financially and threatens to make a complete break with Persia. Telegraphic communication with Tehran was restored on the 17th December, but all messages are censored and the use of code is prohibited to private persons and commercial firms. The post is opera ting between Tabriz and Tehran, but is liable to censorship as are correspondence and papers carried by travellers. While still protesting that they do not want to break with Persia, the National Government are on the verge of it, and if the Russians desire it, the attitude of the Central Government provides them with all the excuse they need. Azerbaijan, however, cannot exist as an independent State. If it parts from Persia, it must inevitably be absorbed by Russia, Its future relations with Tehran, therefore, depend entirely on what Stalin wants and on how far he thinks he can go in the face of British and American opinion. It is worth noting, however, that from the first the Democrat party have tried to remove the Azerbaijan question from the purely domestic Persian sphere and make it an international question. Internal Administration. 18. While the final form of local government within the province by means of “ democratically ” elected councils remains yet to be settled, numerous appoint ments of provincial officials have been made In general, the old structure of administration is being kept, with farmandars (governors) and bakhshdars (mayors) appointed by the Minister of the Interior. These officials will, however, function by the advice of and subject to the supervision of the popularly-elected councils. In Tabriz a head of municipality has been appointed and arrangements are being made to elect a municipal council. The head of the municipality is Bayat Maku, a son of the old Sardar of Maku, who fell foul of Reza Shah and one of whose relicts—Anali Khanum—still owns the remains of the Sardar’s property at Maku, but is not particularly hien vue either by Russians or Democrats. 19. The heads of the local government departments in Tabriz were, of course, removed by the National Government, but most of the minor civil servantsG methods used in collection are so much more ruthless than under the old regime that most of the tax due from certain enterprises for the last year has in fact been paid to the local treasury. Trade and Industry. 23. Trade has been declining during all the period under review. Uncertainty about the future caused wholesale dealing in the bazaar to dry up,^ and although the export trade, particularly in carpets, began to look up in August^ and September, the difficulties placed in its way by the Democrat party, even before they seized power, killed it later in the year. At present a few com modities, but no food-stuffs, are being sent for sale in Tehran on the condition mentioned in the previous paragraph. As a result of the embargo on the export of food-stuffs the prices of some locally-produced articles have come down; geese and turkeys, for instance, which were prepared for the Tehran market towards the end of December had to be sold off in Tabriz for 50 or 60 rials each, less than half the normal price. But, in general, retail prices show little change from what they were six months ago. The cessation of payment by the National Bank has added to the difficulties of trade within the province; the only source of money now is the Imperial Bank of Iran, and merchants are reluctant to flaunt their wealth before the Ministry of Finance by making large purchases. The National Government itself is in the market as a seller, having acquired a large stock of sugar, tea and cotton piece-goods from the Persian Supply Department which it wants to turn into cash. Immediately after seizing power it advertised the sale of 100 tons of sugar, but found no buyers. The Russians, nevertheless, have been able to dispose of a certain amount oJ sugar and cotton cloth. They have been able to sell the latter by promising to arrange for permission to export it to Tehran. The same political and financial difficulties have, of course, had an adverse effect on the import trade, and the promise of a big increase in purchases from the United Kingdom has unfortunately not been fulfilled. 24. The factories of Tabriz have shown no signs of recovering from their depression. One match factory and one leather factory are the only two which have continued to work at a profit. The policy of the National Government aims both at making the factories profitable again and at mulcting the owners of some of the fat profits they made in former years. They have already taken over one leather factory, acquiring all its one-toman shares at the price of 2-50 rials— though it is doubtful whether they have paid for them. The match factory has paid 11 million rials arrears of income tax. The Khosrovi Leather Factory is under distraint for the payment of 6-6 million. Most of the managers and directors of the textile factories are absent in Tehran, and, as these concerns also will most probably be required to pay their taxes, it is likely that they, too, will be taken over by the Government. The practice of selling a factory’s product on the local market to collect taxes due is wasteful and short-sighted, since the Tabriz market can only absorb a small part of the output, and that at a very low price. Unless, therefore, some trade settlement is made with Tehran, the only outlet for the goods of local factories will be Soviet Russia. But the diversion of the province’s entire export trade to Russia will mean a drastic cut in the exaggerated profits which it is the custom of Tabriz manufacturers to demand and make, with consequent reductions in wages. That the reorganisation of industry means harder work, stricter conditions and lower profits seems already to have dawned on some of the National Government and on the leader of the workers’ union. New and stricter rules of work in the factories have been drawn up and approved by the union, and the workers are beginning to find that factory life is not the fun it was in the slack old “ reactionary ” times. The union has a short way with slackers : on the foreman or manager’s complaint a couple of riflemen are likely to appear at the factory and march the defaulter off to the union headquarters, whence he returns in a more serious and chastened mood. Kurdish Affairs. 25. The last four months have seen a development in Kurdish Nationalist plans similar to that of the Azerbaijan Nationalists. Contact between Kurdish Nationalists and Russian political officers has been constant, and about September it began to be apparent that the Russians were taking the Nationalist Komalla Kurd Society seriously in hand. In that month five Kurdish chiefs, including Gazi Mohamed, Nuri Beg and a chief of the Dehboukris were taken on a visit to Baku, where it seems clear they were advised by the President of the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic and other influential Russians to combine with the Turki-speaking Azerbaijani separatists7 and were, no doubt, given an approved plan of action. Shortly after their return the formation of a “ Democrat party of Kurdistan ” was announced with Gazi Mohamed as president and headquarters at Mahabad. A printing press and a quantity of newsprint were supplied to the society by the Russians. The society’s manifesto called for the establishment of an autonomous Kurdistan “within the Persian State,' and pledged full support to the Democrat party ♦ of Azerbaijan. Kurdish observers were present at the National Congress (para graph 12 above), and at the opening of the Azerbaijan National Parliament. About the middle of December Kurdish spokesmen declared that a National Assembly of Kurdistan would be opened in Mahabad within a few days, but by the end of the year there was no firm news that this had been done. 26. Towards the end of October Mullah Mustafa Barzani and his brother with about 2,000 families of his tribe, fleeing from the Iraqi Government forces, crossed the Persian frontier and settled in the Sulduz area. He has been welcomed, if not too warmly, by the chieftains who support the Kurdish Democrat party, and is likely to play a part in the formation of an autonomous Kurdistan in this part of Persia. While Democratic principles do not appeal to the feudal chiefs of the Kurds, the majority of them support the party as a means of securing their independence. Those who fear both Russian domination and the ambition of upstarts like Gazi Mohamed, nevertheless support the most powerful party out of prudence. Co-operation with the Azerbaijan National Government has been so far slight: Nuri Beg and Rashid Beg Herki came in to help with the reduction of the Rezaieh garrison, but were sent away again by the Russians. There are some indications, too, that the Russians may not intend autonomous Kurdistan to be on an equal footing with autonomous Azerbaijan, but may design to keep the Kurdistan administration subordinate to the National Government at Tabriz. Soviet Policy. 27. All the foregoing paragraphs are, of course, a description of Soviet policy; the Russian aim was and is the establishment of an autonomous Azerbaijan. But, as previously, the question was what sort of a regime they intended for Azerbaijan; now it is, what do they intend to do with the autonomous Azerbaijan they have created? It is •clear that Azerbaijan cannot continue in its present indeterminate position, owing allegiance to Persia but disowned by Tehran; guided, supported and protected by the Soviet Union, but theoretically part of a foreign sovereign State. Had it been the Russians’ desire to detach Azerbaijan completely from Persia, nothing could have been easier when the Democrats seized power; a plebiscite as efficiently run as the elections would have given a unanimous vote in favour of union with the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic. Many people in Azerbaijan think that this will yet be done, and that the instru ment to be used has already been prepared, in' the shape of the “ Friends of Soviet Azerbaijan ’’ Society, which has recently been formed. There are, perhaps, two reasons why it has not been done : first, even the Russians may well be puzzled how to camouflage convincingly so flagrant a breach of their treaty undertakings; second, Azerbaijan may be much more useful to Soviet policy as part of Persia than as part of the Soviet Union, since, as one of the most populous and richest provinces (the equally rich province of Mazanderan being also in the Russian zone), it can be used to put great pressure on the Central Government, to influence the composition of the Government and Majlis and to serve as an open door through which Soviet influence can enter and spread to all parts of Persia. The Russians, in short, may view Azerbaijan as an instrument by means of which the whole of Persia can be turned into an Outer Mongolia. If that is a possible guess at the long-term policy of Russia, certain effects of her short-term policy are no longer guesswork; Russian engineers are already drilling for oil in the province, others are surveying for copper, gold and possibly other minerals, and the whole trade of the province is being carefully shepherded to the Soviet fold. British Interests. 28. Where things have gone so much according to the Russian plan British interests have inevitably suffered. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in this province has to compete with the Russian Iransovnaft Company, and the Russians naturally view with equanimity difficulties which tend to restrict the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company's trade and extend that of Iransovnaft. The company's depots have suffered no violence in the troubles of the last month or so, and there has been only a negligible loss of money through the Democrats shirking paymentx 8 for some of the petrol, &amp;c., consumed. But the supply of products to the agencies up and down the province has been delayed and obstructed by the Democrats commandeering lorries of the company, and, with the interruption of banking business, the agents are unable to remit the proceeds of their sales to Tabriz. The Imperial Bank of Iran, which has suffered so far only a loss of business through the drying up of trade and the closing of the National Bank, is accused by the National Government of withholding credit from the bazaar, of/*\ transferring funds out of Azerbaijan and of taking up a hostile attitude to the _ new Government by refusing to nonour the signatures of the officials of the National Bank and one of the private banks whose balances with the Imperial Bank the National Government naturally want to obtain. At the end of December there were signs that the National Government would put pressure on the Imperial Bank in Tabriz by threatening to withdraw their protection and by refusing to grant legal facilities. 29. The sales of British propaganda material, which remained at their usual level through August, September and October, declined sharply when the troubles began in November. The agents in the provincial towns may well be afraid of incurring odium (or inviting violence) as agents of a “ reactionary Power ” if they display British literature. The agent at Marand was killed during the seizure of that town by the Democrats at the end of November—though probably more because he was a wealthy landowner than as the distributor of reactionary propaganda. It is very probable, too, that parcels of publicity material sent from Tabriz would be seized in the local post offices. However, the change in methods of distribution of the more popular periodicals instituted by the Public Relations Bureau at Tehran during the period under review has relieved this consulate- general of most of the task of despatching to agents, and hence it is not possible to ascertain how far sales have fallen in many lines. On the other hand, the closing of the National Bank has made it impossible for the provincial newsagents to buy British publications from the wholesale dealer in Tehran. Throughout the crisis in Tabriz, the Public Relations Bureau shop radio attracted a large audience to listen to the news of Azerbaijan—some of it unfortunately very inaccurate—given in Persian by the B.B.C. and Tehran radio. Democrat criticism of the B.B.C. was sharp at one period and it was feared that we might be asked not to broadcast, but no such request has so far been made, and the only hostile demonstration against the shop was a half-hearted one by a few mischievous youths who broke the window. Conclusion. 30. The last four months have seen the logical result of the policy of interference in Persia’s internal affairs which the Soviet authorities have pursued in this province ever since the occupation. The Persians have never been masters in their own house in Azerbaijan, and hence, as far as the day-to-day life of the common people is concerned, nothing much is altered by the transference of power to the National Government. Before the events of the 12th December, however, the Persians could always look forward to the blessed 2nd March, when, thev piously hoped, the last Russian soldier would take the road to the north and they could do as they liked again. That hope, if not dead, is now in extremis. Even those fatalistic old Conservatives who have seen both Tsarist and Ottoman invaders come and go before are beginning to admit reluctantly that this time it is different. It seems hardly likely that the Russians will bluntly break their promise to withdraw on the 2nd March, but the present situation offers well-nigh endless possibilities of legal quibbling and chicanery; Azerbaijan may argue that it is no longer part of Persia within the meaning of the treaty; or Stalin may graciously grant the petition of the Azerbaijan people to allow their Soviet guests to stay a little longer; or, if the Soviet troops do depart, they will be no further away than Julfa, and can cover the 90 miles from there to Tabriz rapidly enough in response to an appeal for protection against the blood-drinking hordes of the Tehran reactionaries. • , 31.
