Born in Qurna (though she does not know her date of birth), Naamat relates her childhood experiences and activities like playing, attending weddings, dancing, and singing, and states that that there was nothing to be afraid of on the hillside. Naamat tells of getting married when she was young, and giving birth to six sons and a daughter without the involvement of doctors. Naamat explains how tourism used to be a primary source of income for all families living in Qurna. Naamatâ€™s father had a small shop, and her husband and sons worked in the tourist industry, her husband as a tour guide though he is currently unemployed. Naamat tells of the displacement of Qurna residents from the hillside, and the destruction of most of their houses.  She states that she and her parents and sisters were displaced from their house in Qurna but were not given apartments or land as compensation; she notes that others did not receive apartments either. Her family kept cattle in their old house, which had been a source of income, but they had to sell them because they would not fit in the small apartments that they had expected to receive. </dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
