No, C/795-1.V5 Dated the 28th December 1938 / f Dear Sir Trenchard, &lt;■ ^ 1 &amp; Will you please refer to your Confidential letter No» 704-S dated the 13th December 1938 on the subject of Bahrain Agitation? 2. I feel that I must contest the analogy drawn between the British (i.e. foreign) rule in India and the Shaikh* s Government in Bahrain, and also the argument that because the Shaikh's Government is autocratic it must ipso facto iff' # attract agitation. 3. I do not deny that for the reasons given in my demi- official letter No. C/666 dated the 27th October 1938 I was a little anxious about this business at the beginning. We had not then seen how Bahrain would react to anonymous under ground agitation, and I was worried by the apparent credulity of the people towards false or distorted rumour. The agitation was amorphous and it was impossible in the early stages to ascertain clearly how widespread restlessness might be. The ultimate result has been most heartening. The real Arabs have rallied to the Shaikh in a spirit of genuine affection and loyaltyf the Bahama of the villages have been pouring into Manama lately to declare their entire contentment and loyalty and to protest against the assumption ci* leadership over them by some of the Manama Town Baharna 'politiciansfuller in vestigation has shown that the agitation and the so-called nati onalism/- b Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Powle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.nationalism centred in the community of Holis, and resentment at what is regarded locally as their impertinence and presump tion is profound. In the light of these facts I would say that the odds are heavily against the growth of any sort of mm*m m ■ w „ ; ^ .. popular agitation against tho Gov8rniii6nt of Bahrain for yoars to come; and granted the method of evolution for which I have - H f .(5-Im pleaded in paragraph 9 of my demi-official letter Fo.

I do not of course seek to oppose your viev; that minor concessions can and should be granted with advantage. Where - .... yy wswk. vntaen.****!*.***-* I venture to differ from you is in regard to the form those concessions should take and the advice that should be given to the Shaikh* As you say, Belgrave and I are strongly opposed to an Advisory Council. We are equally strongly opposed to ^ an Advisory Financial Committee. Briefly our reasons are these (i) (ii) (iii) 5. I do not think that any particular publicity for the »_ \jfi ^ Financial Council referred to by Belgrave is necessary. Every one here knows that it exists; and to substitute weekly M durbars'/- No one v/ants it, except the insignificant group of self-seeking Holis who are responsible for articles such as the one you quote (which in claiming to represent public opinion is the most lamentable perversion of the truth). Finance being the foundation of administration, everyone would (quite rightly, I think) see in it the none too thin end of the Executive Council wedge, of revolution and the overthrow of the existing system of Government. All our arguments against a Council apply therefore eoually stronalv to a Financial Committee. It could serve no purpose because ^ Any person who has any reasonable ideas offinancing schemes or institutions for the public benefit can already express them, $ (b) Publicity about the Government's financial administration and policy can far more effectively be disseminated by other means.-3- 'durbars' for the daily access to any one of its members would be far from popular. My brief experience of Arabs is that they like to be able to make their complaint or petition as and when the spirit moves them, rather than wait till 'next Wednesday'; and of course here they do get an assurance of investigation — and the investigation is made* *0* r 6. With reference to paragraphs 7 and 8 of your letter, relating to the matter of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, '■'-'Wwirtatlfc.-- though I am of course avoiding too active intervention I feel there are equally good reasons for avoiding too rigid aloofness. It seems to me that if I can do anything to % remove the possibility of labour trouble, I should 'go to it' because (a) Some day we may need this oil badly and we shall not want labour troubles to interfere with supply; (b) Though the Bahrain Petroleum Company is actually an American concern, it is nevertheless a registered British Company, and legally entitled to protection under the Bahrain Order in Council. It would ill accord with our ideas if I held aloof until we reached the stage when the intervention of the Law became necessary. (c) Reducing the question to its lowest terms, the Political Agent can get the Oil Company moving rather faster and more effectively than any one else. Thus, though I should rigorously avoid being mixed up in individual cases, there seems much advantage in the Political Agent taking part ' in discussions of general principles, if by so doing he can expedite the removal of a potential source of general complaint (e.g. the elimination of % Mten anna wage-rate, cf. paragraph SCiii) of my demi-official letter No. C/763 dated the 10th December 1938) or the grant of desirable general concessions (e.g. paid Holidays and a provident fund, cf. paragraph 3(vii) of the same letter). (d) As a corollary to the above. The Agency has fairly considerable prestige in Bahrain and Belgrave agrees with me that most people would be satisfied if the Political Agent stated that he had taken an interest in an investigation into such and such a general allegation and had satis fied himself that it was unfounded. 7. I agree entirely that the Political Agent should try to create confidence in both sides that he is a benevolent «? i ^ arbitrator./—4— arbitrator. That is exactly my object in dealing with the special task of the moment — the removal of mis understanding and the promotion of mutual confidence and satisfaction. I can assure you that I shall be careful not to become Involved as a sort of standing intervener, nor to permit any impression to gain ground that I represent the Company.

'l /, L^\ Will you please refer to your demi-official letter s No# 764_s dated the 22nd December 1938 on the subject of Administration of Justice in Bahrain ? ^2. Belgrave's use of the word 'important' when saying that he proposes to sit on the Bahrain Court when import ant cases occur was perhaps a little obscure. He has actually sat on the Court for important cases in the last two years though of course for obvious reasons he has had to restrict his participation in original court work to 4 the really important cases. Now he intends» as a temporary measure, to take a considerably wider interpretation of the word 'important'. , • ■ 3. Belgrave has pointed out to me that he omitted to make mention, in his report on the Administration of Justice, of the existence of the final Court of Appeal, consisting of himself and Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman. I remember that he mentioned this to you on one of your visits soon after I came to Bahrain, and it is mentioned in the Section in the Govern ment of Bahrain's Annual Report for the year 1356 relating to the Judicial Department. This Court deals with any appeals I HIM ■—'■I*- ■ -i* ■ that there may be from the decision of the Senior Bahrain Court, though in point of fact there is not a vast number of ' . ^^ , . -in r - them. It is of course a little inconvenient that Belgrave is a member of an appellate Court which may deal with appeals from/- inourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Powle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.from another Court of which he is also a member, but this disadvantage is far outweighed by the great advantage of having a final Court of Appeal. And, after all, it is an anomaly which we may hope will not continue for very long.

The provision of two legal experts to assist in tne reform of the Bahrain Courts was suggested in paragraph 3 of i my letter quoted above, and is now under way (vide enclosure II to India Office Printed' letter ITo.P, 3.108/39, dated the 10th January 1939). In addition to this, to meet the grievances of the Bahrain! employees of the Bahrain Petroleum company (see ray telegram So. 360, dated the 16th November 1938), following on consultation between the Bahrain (jrovernment and the Company assisted by :;feightman, conditions of service have been improved, and a 'Representative of tne Bahrain Govern* I ment has been appointed to the Company whose business it will be to look after the employees , interests: an excellent move. Such immediate action as was necessary has therefore been taken. 4. There remains, however, the question of tne future / policy Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIS.,CSI.,MV0., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Belni. \ v \ vV 4 tm Qm policy of the Bahrain QOTernasnt towards local agitation, and here Teightman, supported by Belgrade (whoa I asked Weigntman to consult), is of one opinion and i am of another. Briefly I think that, not now but in the course of the next year or so, we shall most probably have to adrise the anaikh, and his family, to have an Adrieory ooancil, noiainated by him, while Weightaan and Belgrade are strongly against such a step, and are of the opinion that Bahrain can do without any Council at all 'for years to come'. The problem as you will see is not urgent, but as I shall cease to be Resident wi thin a few months from now I think it as well to leave behind me some record of this important matter for the benefit of my successor, as well as of the India Office and of the Government of India. 5, Weightman's and Belgrave' s views, which as tney come from experienced men on the spot must be given weight, arei (a) that any pressure from us to form a Council - even an Advisory one nominated by the Shaikh - would be most unpopular with the a 1 JChalifah Family, and would make us equally un popular with them, whereas at present they are extremely loyal |^f|N and friendly to as. The Family have already discussed the question amongst themselves, and regard tne formation of a Gouncil as the end or the Al Khal if ah rule in Bahrain. (b) By far the greater majority of the people of Bahrain do not want a Council, the demand for which is confined to a small minority consisting mostly of young men belonging' to the ' ■ £$ ■ i j M &lt; ~ $£ , k jjig. m. Youth Movement, (there is one in Bahrain) and * Holis 1 ' i, e. Persians domiciled in Bahrain. support of tnis, inter alia ^ IH lW Weightaan has forwarded a communication from Belgrave to tne / eff ect/ Ml \. -3- effect that deputation® from the Shia Bahama (who were the agitators on the pre^ioua oocaaion referred to in my letter under reference) have come to the shaikh presenting petitions affirming their loyalty to His Highness and his goYernrnent, and stating emphatically that they do not want any form of Council. (c) That - in answer to a point I raised - anyone can approach the shaikh, or members of his family, or Belgrade L : 1 »#4 $ ^ /?t / himself, with ccaplaints for redress of grievances. , , -itL, ^4 .1* r' (d) That there is alrea(2y an unofficial Council in existence consisting of the Shai&amp;h, his family and BelgraTe. further two Municipalities already exist in Manaman and Kuharraq, with elected Councils which already give tne people a measure of self-goTernaent, (e) That since the Bahrain atoinistrati on is already good and efficient what need is there for a Council ? (f) That though Councils have come into being in the neighbouring States of Kuwait and Dibai, conditions in those States are quite different to tnoae prevailing in Bahrain, 6, in reg&amp;rd to these arguments my replies are as follows. There Is no question of bringing 'pressure* to bear on the Bahrain GoYernment to have an Advisory Council. #e * would merely advise the OhaiJch to nominate one, in his own interests, and that of his Family, as much as for any other reason, and inform him tiiat if he did not do so the responsi bility for the consequences would be entirely Ms and not ours. That it would be much better for him to grant a minor conces sion now (i.e. at the time we gave the advice) in the shape of / ®ftu« j v j m an A^viaoiy Council rather than to be forced later to give a major concession in the shape of an Sxecutive one. That a wise Ruler knew when to give way as well as when to stand firm, and Rulers who were not so wise, and who refused to give any conces sions at all» had eventually to give far more concessions than they otherwise would have had to. It may be argued that the Shaikh and his Family would have the foresight to institute such a Council at tile appropriate time - should tnis become necessary - without any move on our part* This would naturally be the best solution, but I see little prospect of the Al 'Oialifah exercising this foresight without our intervention. Of course they might not take our advice, but I think that it would have considerable influence with them, even if unpalatable. Belgrave and Weightraan point out that even our advice, i.e. not 'pressure', to institute a Council would considerably disgruntle the shaikh and his Family. I agree, and there is no doubt that the present autocratic rule by the Shaikh and his Family, who are extremely friendly towards us, suits us very well. There is no question therefore of giving our advice before it is needed, the more so as the Bahrain Administration is a reasonably good one. But there may come a time, and in th« not very distant future, when if agitation increases and widens we shall have to give this advice in our interests as well as those of Bahrain. We are not the Paramount Power in relation to Bahrain, and have therefore no legal responsibility for its internal affairs as between the Ruler and his people, but at the same time since we preclude any other influence in thai state other than our own we have a certain general res ponsibility which, it is diff icult to evade, and which in the / past/ f -5- f l £ 1 T I l - jr past in fact we Have not been able to erade, (Some 16 years ago, fear instance, we used our influence to replace tne late Shaikh ' isa by the present Huler - though the former still remained the titular Shaikh, and the latter became the .Regent,) We could not view with equanimity a state of affairs in Bahrain in which there was a strong agitation amonget the people for a more democratic form of government which was refused by the Shaikh, still less if this refusal could only be made effective by the continual use of force. Nor on the other hand would it suit us in any way if the •popular 1 party got the upper-hand and deprived the Al Khalifah of all power toy the imposition of an elected Sxecutive Council, a nominat ed Executive council in fact, on which the Shaikh would sit, forms a convenient half-way house between tne present auto cratic form of government in Bahrain and an elected Executive Council, which would sit on the Shaikh I The point at issue is at what stage we should advise the Shaikh to establish the former, and this will depend on the progress of agitation in Bahrain, (b) The fact, which I am prepared to accept, tnat at present the agitation is mainly confined to a Youth Movement does not get over the awkward fact that youths have an un comfortable way of growing up, and growing up fast, and just because they are young and energetic assuming a position in that State, and an influence on public opinion, out of all proportion to their numbers. This is what may happen in Bahrain and the agitation may then spread to other classes at present unaffected. Of the young Bahraini Weigntman wrote recentlyi (I quoted his descriptipn in another connection. f f f/ff^« fT*| ' 9 see paragraph 7 of my letter iiOf207-S, dated the 17th March 3.939, but give it here again for ready reference)i 'Increased* \ bp j 'Increaaed educational facilities in recent years have produced a class of young men witii a veneer of education who respond readily to press propaganda, listen to broad casts and develop political feelings, fhey believe them selves to be progressive and despise their illiterate parents who, since the youths are earning quite good wages, have lost all influence over then, they are nationalistic, especially since they see foreigners earning more money tnsn they themselves do. They know that they are better educated than the ruling family and are inclined therefore to despise them# fhey come mainly from Man amah and Muharraq., and most of than work with the Gil Company, in Government offices and witn films in Manamah** This is precisely the class which has given so much trouble in India, Egypt and elsewhere. It is not a class which by any means is bad in itself: it is formed by the force of circumstances. (c) The administration of Bahrain has become increasingly complicated, and it is very difficult for the Shaikh to carry on the simple patriarchal justice of the old days. I am sure that he, the Shaikh, and the members of tne Family, as well as Belgrade himself, give a syupatnetic hearing to any grievances which are brought to them. It is not a case, nowever, so much of remedying indiiridual grievances as of having saie duly constituted body, through which can be ventilated general grievances, wnetner real or imaginery, a sort of safety valve in fact. At present nc such valve exists, and it is difficult for tnose who are discontented to call attention to tneir grievances except by tne unconstitutional means of rowdy / agitation■ ■ ) si ,J -7- . ; agitation and such like. I do not say tuat sucn demonatrations wmld altogether cease if a Council were establianed, but tney would be less likely, and if tney did occur the Bahrain Govern ment, having given a constitutional safety valve, would be in a stronger p(Bitic® to deal with the® than they are at present. Moreover in modern conditions in Bahrain it seems tome that distinctly the best way for the Shaikh and his family to Keep in touch with the people of their State would be through a Council which, even though nominated and not elected, would • if wisely chosen - reflect local public opinion. (d) {l) In these days people are not content with a govern ment, however good and efficient it may be, unless they have some hand in it themselves. To use the well-worn clionet '♦Good government is no substitute for self-government. Tne old Government of India was undoubtedly good and efficient, in fact a benevolent autocracy, but that did not prevent our having to change it to self-government. (2) There is moreover this aspect to be considered. Until a few years ago the Bahrain Government was very badly . • ' ' ■ ' 1 ■, ' ! _ 'i.* • : , ' . , \ , - : , . ■ . ' ^ \ i •' \ . : 1 ■ s v. off, and where there is little to expend there cannot be much ' a ■ ■ ■ • ■ ' : ' '■ • ' ..'f c;. i . criticism over expenditure. Mow, however, in addition to its ; • ■ . ' ' ' U ; ; ... ■ ^ revenue from other sources, it is in receipt of a large income t r oil r oy i 01« it b gtp par cut s 0110 y e bm 0 that a considerable revenue would result from oil, Loch - who was then Political Agent, Bahrain - proposed tnat we should approach the Shaikh and suggest that a certain proportion of the royalties should be given over by him to tne state. The Shaikh readily agreed and out of the total revenue from this source of about £ 260,000 gives £ 170,000 per annum to tne State, keeping / theI 5 ^ | the balanoe of a^oiat £ 90,000 per annum for his Privy Purae, This from one point of view is quite generous, fhe contract is between the Shaikh and the Oil Company» and as according to old ideas in Bahrain the Shaikh is the State there would have been nothing to prevent him putting the whole of the revenues into his own pocket, from another and sore modern point of view however, which is now creeping into the Arab States, it coald be argued that the royalties belonged to tne state, out of which the latter should all &gt;t a proportion to the Shaikh - and not the other way round. In addition to his share of the oil royalties the Shaikh has a Civil iist of about 4|r lakhs annual ly. So he and the family, with whom he shares his revenues, enjoy something like &lt;£ 115,000 per annum private income from the State I From this aspect therefore, and putting oneself in the place of a disgruntled Bahraini, (in order to get a grasp of papular movements it is essential every now and then to see the question from the agitator's point of view), the position is that in the small State of Bahrain, the total population of which amounts to only about 120,000 a very large revenue is administered without any check whatever by tne Shaikh and his ■Family, and by a foreigner (Belgrave), and furtner that of tnis revenue the Shaikh and his family put a very large fraction into their own pockets. In so far as Belgrave is concerned we know of course that he is an extremely efficient and hard working officer, honest it goes without saying, with the interests of the 3tat ® wholly at heart, and that Bahrain is extremely fortunate to have his services. But such arguments would I fear not cut much ice with the agitator, and in fact tne tone of some / ofof the attacks on Bahrain which have appeared of late in tne 4'' Arab Press is that Belgrave is the real Ruler of Bahrain, the Shaikh having been reduced to a cypher. In so far as the snaikh and his Family are concerned, the agitator would doubtless be of the opinion that they should receive for their own share of the revenue far less than they do at present. I nave no doubt that were an Executive Council ever to materialise in Banrain, tne first step they would take would be to cut down drastically tne share of the State revenues at present enjoyed by tne Al Khalifah Family. I expect that even a nominated Advisory Council would try and make a move sooner or later in tne same direction, and that this is one of the reasons why the idea of a Council is so unpopular with the Family. It is quite true that, as far as I can see, the State revenues are being well spent on preserving law and order - Police, and on improvements and social services, but from the agitator's point of view this does not cover the large sum absorbed annually by the Family, nor the agitator's farther point (which he would doubtless make) that if there were some popular control on finance such improvements and services would be even more extensive and more economical. (I am not of course saying that this would be the cases I am merely putting forward the agitator's arguments.) In so far as the Municipalities are concerned, it is quite true that they give the people a measure of control in municipal matters, but the agitator would reply - this is not sufficient, and as the Municipalities have been well administered (which I ; ' ; f believe is the case) why should not the people be given still more power ? / (e)i i / I ( / —10*' (e) It is quite true that conditions in Kuwait and Dibai differ from those at Bahrain, but the fact that popular moTe- ments have arisen in those States, which are more backward than Bahrain, shows how genuine in the Arab States is tiie feeling for more democratic forms of governmente to go outside tAe Gulf, it is a point of seme interest that much tne same agita tion is now prevalent in the Indian States. 7» To sum up &gt; The present autocratic government of Bahrain suits ua very well, and any advice from us to the snaiich and his family to change its form for a more democratic one, even tne modified one of a nominated Advisory Council, would not be palatable and would tend to make ua unpopular with tnem. fhere is therefore no question of our giving this advice before it is necessary. At the same time agitation for a more democratic form of government has arisen in Bahrain, thougn it is at present confined more or less to the activities of an immature Youth Movement. It is true that tne government of Bahrain is efficient, but its great defect from tne modern popular point of view, which is now being taken in tne Arab States of tne Gulf, is that it is an entirely autocratic one, in which tne people - except in the Municipalities - have no hand. This criticism is all the more cogent, at all events from tne agitator*s point of view, since the Bahrain Government nowadays administer, in addition to its revenue from other sources, a large income froji oil royalties. A considerable portion of the latter, as well as a Civil list which is also paid by tne \ Stats, goes into the pockets of the Shaikh and his family. \ Should the present agitation increase and spread from tne / Youth ! . \ \•• 1 '1 — Youth HOTement to other olaases • aa suoii agitations often do - we could not divest oursalveB* though we are not In the position of the Paramount J?ower towards Bahrain, of all responsibility for the consequences. We could not view with equanimity a condition of strong and continual agitation in Bahrain for a more democratic fom of goTemraent, especially if this agita tion could only be Icept in check by the Bahrain Government by the continual use of force, ifor would it suit us in any way If the popular party got the upper-hand completely and deprived the Shaikh and his fajaily of most, if not all, of their power by the imposition of an elected Executive Council. A conven ient half-way house between the present autocratic government of Bahrain, and a purely democratic form of rule, would be a nominated Advisory Council. There is, however, little prospect of the \1 Shalifah taking this step themselves, and tne point at issue is when we should advise tnem to take it, having regard to the fact that our advloe, even though unpalatable, will nave considerable influence with them. At what sta^e we give this advice, or if we give it at all, will depend on tne progress of the agitation in Bahrain, bearing in mind the important l&gt;oint that it would be far better for an Advisory Council to be instituted a little too soon, when it will come in the guise of a generous concession, than a little too late, wnen it will appear as a surrender extorted under fear of consequences. 8. I fear I have written at seme length, but while the importance of all the Arab states of the Gulf has of late years increased rapidly Bahrain still remains tne most important, and I feel that this matter of local agitation, and the way it is handled both by the Bahrain Government and ourselves, will / affect12 affect in one way or another all our relations with and our Interests in that State. I have tnou^ht it best therefore to dra.w as full a pic tare aa possible of the question, more especially as I shall not be here to assist in making any final decisions on it, for the benefit of the Government of India, tne India Office, and my successor, who I suggest should watch the Bahrain situation closely and in due course submit his views. # I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel and leightman. c/c ^ *sent under Printed Letter No,348-3 of the 14th April, 1939,Telegram 4, :rora iolitical Agent, Bahrain, iolitical Resident, ^ushire. - 0 • 68 Dated and received nth Lay 1939. fov^ India Office Jtrinted Letter 0.P.2.100 dated 10th January# Legal i^xperts for Bahrain.

I have had this thought in ■! |r|| ^ ' t | t ' ii i mind ever since, and with it various ideas for creating industries ........ i which might supplement and ultimately replace the oil industry in Bahrain. We are exhorting the Bahrain Government to set aside large sums of money annually from their oil royalties in order to provide a Reserve sufficient in future years to ensure the continued administration of Bahrain on the scale that exists at present; hut I cannot help feeling that the money which is going into the Reserve is not being quite sufficiently !, active'. It is admittedly earning interest and so is providing for the continua nce of social services in future, but it does not actively con tribute towards the commercialisation of Bahrain and the conseque increased prosperity of its people. . I do not mean to suggest that I would recommend a serious diminution of the sums placed in the Reserve annually, but I think we should consider whether some part of the annual surpluses should not be devoted to more * ' , I||I,|||||U|...||I|1I 'iWiin'mw'!'' •- Wr- productive schemes. 2. When Ibn Saud was being taken round the Refinery, Shaikh Hamad pointed out to him a stone-crusher which was at work and most inaccurately described it as a machine for making cement. At/- rable Lieutenant-Colonel r Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., I Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. n Sj, - 2- At about the same time the California Standard Company's senior geologist was in Bahrain and enquired whether cement was made here, and if not why not. These two remarks led to the thought that it might be possible to manufacture cement in Bahrain, and ^111 pin i ^ , ,, ^ I have had some discussion on this matter with Thornburg. Broadly speaking there are, I gather, three main requisites — fuel, limestone and clay. In Bahrain we have unlimited fuel — the waste gases from the oil which are burnt off at present; we have unlimited quantities of limestone, though we should want to know something of its relative purity; and there is clay, used by the potters of 'Ali. We do not know how extensive the clay beds are, but I have suggested to Belgrave that he might be able to borrow — —' ■'■Miin.ii.i II I • or hire a geologist from the Oil Company to make a rough survey of the (more or less) surface clay deposits. If these are ade- quate then it seems highly probable that a most profitable indus try can be started. I think it is uncommon for the three main requisites to be found located - practically free - in so small an area, and this factor should go a long way to ensuring that Bahrain can manufacture cement at highly competitive prices. The demand of course exists, and though the Bahrain Petroleum Company may not require so much cement in future, certainly the California Arabian Company will be using thousands of tons; probably Petroleum Concessions Limited would be a big purchaser; Abadan (which I^think uses Japanese cement at present) might be a good customer if we can disguise origin; and Iraq with its irrigation projects and so on should be a most valuable customer. All this of course depends on Bahrain being able to produce a really high grade Portland cement at a competitive price, 3. If once one industry is started others can get going also, I still think that the mother-of-pearl button industry is a possibility, but this would depend to a great extent on India giving Bahrain a preferential customs rate, I think I right in saying that pearl buttons in India are almost a Japanese monopoly /-7/— monopoly and 'tiiere would, be li'ttle chance of breaking that, monopoly unless a preferential customs tariff enabled Bahrain to put its product on the market in 'India at a competitive price. As you know Indian products pay five per cent duty in Bahrain — except for certain articles of luxury which pay ten per cent. Would it therefore be possible to enquire from India what their normal tariff on mother-of-pearl buttons is whether they would give Bahrain a preferential rate corresponding to the Bahrain rate on Indian goods ? 4, I think too that it ought to be possible to do something with the flesh of the hundreds of thousands of oysters which .. I I ^ —'-'-rr— ■■■nil ■ ■ » t ,■mil... - iMm.Aiiii.ii ^ tumrtimilMiii v —es-.' are fished up annually in the pearling. It might be possible to extract valuable oils, for after all the flesh of the edible oyster at any rate is supposed to be full of vitamins; and I should like to know, if the information can be obtained in London, whether pearl fisheries in other parts of the world, e.g. Australia, run any subsidiary industries for the extrac tion of saleable commodities from the flesh of the oyster. Alternatively it might be possible to turn the flesh into a valuable manure. 5. Another possibility is to rationali se the fishing_ industry of Bahrain. Large quantities of dried xish are exported, but everything is done in such a hap-hazard manner that I feel convinced that the proiits are nothing like the size they ought to be. t 6. You have had personal experience of the excellence I 'I' » of the Bahrain prawns# A small toirt proxitablo industry r-^Tm 9 might well be created Dy tinning th es e prawns# Admittedly it would not be a twelve-months-a-year industry ^ •- or txie prawns come and go without much regard for dates and seasons as far as I can make out# Nevertheless there should be money in this5 and employment for a certain number of people.-4- I i 7. In another direction, we ought without further delay- to get on ¥;ith extensive improvements in agriculture. We ' li '''' r '' i rrr' still await the Agricultural Expert's report, and I rather suspect that after all the delay which has occurred it may be of no very great value. Nevertheless we do know that valuable vegetable crops can be grown here - and that a market exists for them; Belgrave has proved that sugar cane can be grown and sold; and even if there were nothing better there is still room for much expansion in date palm cultivation. As far as I know there are considerable areas of unclaimed cultivable land in certain parts of Bahrain, and I have advised Belgrave to put his Land Department on to registering r- all such lands as Government property; and we know that tnere are magnificent artesian water supplies. If however State or quasi-State agricultural projects an a large scale are to be initiated the first essential is for the Bahrain Government to obtain control over all artesian water supplies in tne island. At the moment terrifying quantities of good water are being wasted. Artesian wells have been sunk in extravagant profusion and many of them are not even provided with valves to shut off the flow# His Highness the Shaikh nimselx and the A1 Khalifah are among the worst offenders, and it will need considerable pressure, preferably originating in advice from His Majesty's Government tnemselves, uo induce x^is Highneob to agree on his own account and t&gt;o order o uiier landowner o to put their artesian supplies under Government control. It should not be a difficult task, though it may take some uime and money, to ascertain by experiment the quantity of water required to irrigate a speciiic area xor a specmxc crop in any particular locality in Bahrain. Once this is done all artesian wells should be fitted with locked valves and meters, and it should be the business of a properly conducted Government Department /~ I 4 r-5- Departmsnt to flow each well to the quantity required weekly. In certain areas it will he necessary to construct cement reservoirs, into which the flow from artesian wells can he directed, in order to make a sufficient head of water to irrigate more distant areas. I am not normally in favour of State control over any privately-owned facility, hut I do greatly fear the partial exhaustion of reserves of artesian water under Bahrain if the present lack of control continues. It becomes a matter of even greater importance if an extension of agriculture on a commercial scale comes under contemplation, I have on more than one occasion already urged the need for taking periodic readings of the flow of old and new artesian wells in different localities. 8. The question then arises — how could all these projects be put into effect. As far as possible we should, I think, avoid promoting purely State ownership of new industry. At W— 1 -- - , , the same time we know perfectly well from years of observation that local merchants or businessmen are hopelessly incompetent to promote and manage large scale commercial activities. The solution seems to be to form something on the analogy o f ^a Public Utility Company, with an adequate amount of State control, k but with provision for investment of private money, I have even gone so far as to select a name for such a Company - the Bahrain Development Trust I To begin with it will probably have to look for most of its capital to the Bahrain Government, but once it is set on its feet and begins to show growth I feel convinced that there will be plenty of private money in Bahrain for investment in it, and at that stage the Government should be prepared to sell at par up to 49 per cent of the total capital investment. Shares should be of one rupee deno mination to enable the poorer classes to invest, particularly since I am hoping to create a class of small capitalists in Bahrain /-6— Bahrain by inducing the Oil Company to institute a thrift plan or provident fund for their local employees. The first essential is to find an enthusiast with wide experience of engineering in many different branches, who would be a quasi Bahrain Government servant at first and afterwards purely an employee of the Development Trust. He must have, as many engineers do have, some sales experience and he must of course not only possess drive but also immense reserves of tact and patience. He should in my opinion start off with the Portland cement project and gradually develop the other ideas. 9. Obviously plans quite as extensive as these, involving an outlay of possibly 20. lakhs of rupees, cannot be presented to and pressed on the Bahrain Government on my authority alone, They may even sound a little bit wild in some respects, though I am convinced in my own mind that, with the right man at the helm, the prospects are admirable. I would therefore request your approval (and possibly you may think it desirable 'oo - - , — ^ obtain the blessing of His Majesty's Government and the Govern- ——---- 1 ■ ■ ■■ i !, hi III^bimWWIP 111 ^ 11 ^ ment of India eiLso) to recommening to His Highness the iShaikh ^ ^ v | . the development of Bahrain's resources on some such lines as v, . v;- „ v . ^ ■ •: ^ .it -v^- - v.; c..vr-;; ' ■ 1 • - these, and in particular to searching in such quarters as may • i tf' - r .... ■ 'i** • seem best for an European with wide engineering and sales experience to make a start on such development. 10. The suggestions I have made do not, of course, by any means exhaust the possible field of development. I should like to see the Development Trust take over, for instance, the busi ness management of the Electric Power Plant (Steele, admirable as he is in his own way, has no business flair); I can see further uses for surplus gas to be piped from the Oil Field and Refinery; I would like to see a subsidiary formed to take over Motor Transport as a whole in Bahrain (it is going to be a serious problem soon, if it continues to run on the present hopelessly uneconomic basis with private ownership); I see possibilities /--7- possibilities in a big engineering and machine shop in Bahrain taking over work which the Oil Company would willingly pass to it, and 'machining' for Bahrain in general5 and — without damaging Gray, Mackenzie (who could of course take shares) — there is money to be made from lighterage and barging, from ice-plants, cold storage installations, cinemas and a dozen other things. All that is necessary is a start, Bahrain has the money now - is first in the Gulf to have it - and should go hard for the development of the favoured posi tion she enjoys.

The Minister of Justice has replied that in view of the details now given of the task which the Sheikh would have to carry out, he can no longer unreservedly recommend the appointment of the Sheikh or of any other Egyptian lawyer. He states that it is practically impossible to f ind in Egypt a single lawyer who has both a deep knowledge of Mohammedan law and is qualified to compose a penal or civil code of any kind. He suggests that in order to achieve the object in view, it might be possible to appoint a committee composed of a Sheikh with a knowledge of Mohammedan law, a lawyer experienced in private law, and a criminal lawyer, and he suggests that with a committee of this kind, the necessary measures could be taken in a far shorter time than if the task was entrusted to one man. 2.

You will remember that we had some conversation about this matter and that you said that you thought you could find a Sikh well qualified to compose Criminal and Civil Codes for use in the Bahrain Courts. I have been in communication with Belgrave about this and he agrees that it will be most useful to employ such a man temporarily for this task. So far as a Penal Code and a Criminal Procedure Code are concerned the Sudan models could be followed, though in Bahrain's present stage of development we could probably cut them by at least one half. Civil Codes will be more difficult, but as the Sikh whom you mentioned has apparently had some experience of this kind of work he probably has ideas on the subject. Would it be possible for you to get in touch with this Sikh and to let us know what emoluments he would require to come here and take on this job, which I suppose would occupy him for three months or so ? 3. The framing of Codes is only one half of the problem of course, and it ils a rather more important task ^o teacn tue Bahrain magistrates how to use uhem once ohey c.re ready, xhat however will have to wait for one time being, uhougri 1 do not think we need altogether exclude the pos-jioility finding a retired Sudan civil servant who would be willing and thankful to get out of England for nine months next year.

I wonder whether you would be prepared to come to Bahrain for 3 months this cold vieather and undertake the drafting of these Codes, and if so what remuneration you would expect for this work, the cold weather climate in Bahrain is very agreeable, and there are a number of Sikhs already there so you will not feel lonely S Most of the necessities of life can be purchased there, and X think you would find the time you spend In the Islands very interesting. 3, In addition, the State have a large number of old proclamations which have the force of law and which are avail here that they require the most help 2.

This man was convicted of sedition against the Bahrain I MsSt'-f Qroverrment about a year ago and sentenced to 2^ years imprisonment to be followed by 2- i; years residence outside Bahrain. When Ibn Saud came here in May he asked in a roundabout way if Ali bin Khalifah could be released as the man had worked for him (Ibn saud) during the Yemen war. It was agreed that he should be released provided he lived in the Hejaz for the balance of his sentence. He duly went off and also duly applied to Ibn S&amp;ud for aid when he arrived. The inevitable answer was: 'God will provide' and apparently God has at least provided Ibn Saud with a means of getting rid of the man. in Kuwait, your Shaikh might like to know what a charming guest he has saddled himself with. Ali bin Khalifah may possibly apply to you for a visa for Bahrain and I should be grateful if it could be refused until the full period of 5 years has expired. 2 Assuming that it is a fact that Ali bin Khalifah is Yours sincerely.

You told me later that the Sikh whom you knew was not free to come to Bahrain and for sometime we were in a quandary about bow to proceed. However the news that Judge Lloyd, who is now running the date export industry in Iraq, had gone to India led to the idea that he might possibly be invited to look in at Bahrain on his way back and to dis cuss the framing of codes. Accordingly Belgrave wrote to him about a month ago and a reply has just been received in which he says: 'I am deeply interested (in drafting new codes of law) and really my interest is such that the mafter of terras is of very secondary consideration'. He has written at some considerable length giving a rough out line of the way in which he thinks the work might be done, and the whole thing seems very promising. I will keep you informed of further developments. Hon'ble Lieut.Colonel C.G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Shaikh Mohammad bin • Isa is generally considered a talkative and vain man. it appears that he suffers from jealousy at the popularity of Shaikh Abdullah, his younger brother. Shaikh Mohammad thinks that he should be next to Shaikh namad in importance, that he should be consulted on all mauters and that affairs should be carried on under his supervision. Shaikh Mohammad, unlike Shaikh Abdullah who it is ouSted once aspired to be the ruler of Muharraq, is not popular. Tie has not nelped any one except his own immediate followers and he has earned an unenviable reputation for miserli ness. He feels that somehow the British are responsible for his failure in these respects. He likes to ba considered modern and to be associated with 'new ideas' (Nazi ideas) and it is stated that in his majlis he criticises the British Government alleging that owing to their interference in Bahrain all Government departments are in a state of confusion and that the British are doing this purposely to keep the people in ignorance. He is said not to like the Adviser although he constantly seeks his help. Shaikh Mohammad has travelled more than the others in Iraq, Syria and Egypt and has undoubtedly come into contact with undesirable elements there, ihe Shaikhs probably expected Belgrave to assist them in gaining an increased share of the oil royalty and they may feel that they have been let down but I am inclined to think that Shaikh Mohammad's utterances at Kuwait are the result ol feelings against ohe British and against the Adviser which he has been entertaining for a Ions time.

P.O.No &gt; 54 5—&lt;S • f: f My dear Garoe, In a telegram on the state of public opinion which Alb an sent me recently he mentioned as one of the causes of disaffection in Bahrain a deep-seated discontent with the local administration* I deleted this when tranemitting it for the Ministry of Information and asked him to give me a summary of the reasons of discontent hy mail* 1 enclose a copy of his reply* 2* (a) As regards the Bahrain Courts, the public have cause for complaint* About 10 years ago, when the Courts were very much better, I urged Belgrade to introduce some Codes and to collect and collate the very large number of Alans or notices of the Bahrain Government which had the force of law* I obtained copies of the Sudan ienal Code which was admirably suited to Bahrain, and had the inestim able advantage of a first class Arabic translation, and recommended its introduction* I also got him to place a small committee in charge of the compilation of the Alans * Both these proposals are where I left them in in 1932* Since then Belgrave has more or less disappeared from the Bahrain Court and only functions on some nebulous Court of Appeal* No coded law of any kind exists, though an attempt that was isado during Weightman's time to secure the services of Sardar Lehna Singh, who must be known to you, fell through, likewise an attempt to obtain the services of Judge Lloyd* Belgrave is, however, atill being pursued as far as other preoccupations permit, ir n / bu1; •-♦Garoe Esquire, C*S.I., C*I.S., I .C*3*, Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Simla*-2- but it 11 ver i r difficult to make progress in war time* j r ^ The Shaikhly judges are inoompetent, lazy and arbitrary, and oofflpare unfavourably with those in Kuwait. (b) I am afraid this is true# Belgrave is becoming increasingly unpopular except with the Shaikhs. His mental capacity has not kept pace with the growth of Bahrain, and owing to 15 years in a most debilitating climate, he appears to me to be losing his mental grip* He has become very arbitrary and dislikes criticisms by any local inhabitants, in fact he has absorbed much of the Shaikhs* outlook himself* Be and the other Bahrain officials have had things their own way forao long without any supervision, inspection, or control, ■ that they have become a society of self-satisfied Gzars, and Belgrave, in particular, who has marked likes and dislikes tends to be 'inaccessible^ to any one except the shaikhs, with whom, however, he is very good, and who take up a great deal of his time. He is under the impression that he is over worked, but this is largely due to lack of method and a tendency to waste his time on trivialities. For exafflple» though he does not know anything about animal husbandry he will spend hours looking at some milch cattle owned bj the utate, or in designing new furnishings for the shaikh*s palace. He iSf of course, &lt;iuite ignorant of administration# as he was caught in the jungles of Tanganyika, and though I had suggest ed to him more than once that he should take the opportunity of his leaves to study a little law he has never found time to do so. As regards his financial '•Advisership'' I need only luote his action in investing the entire State He serve in a currency other than that of the state. His own finances he ▼8ry wisely delegates to his wife. . / / (o)I&amp; 09 **Om ■ , , 1 ■ •, ■ v. . . (o) The Cuatome jepartoent le efficient enough, tut the director ie also Bjoat unpopular and arbitrary and poiapoua to a eagres* He ia dialiked by Indiana whom he does not consider worth being polite to* and paradoxically he has far too many in his office» where their presence instead of Arabs gives rise to a great deal of ooament • He is» however, very hard iias one manner for people who matter and another for those who do not. When I waa Political Agent at Bahrain a roan who had been diacharged from the Customs appealed to me regarding seme aoney which was owing to him from the Bahrain Government« He had approached the Director in vain, but instead of making an official matter of it I wrote privately to de Grenier and enquired why the man had not been paid as the amount appeared to be due# He replied somewhat ingenuously that he had been waiting to see whether he appealed or not. I told him that if he attempted to prevent lawful applications to the Agency again I would have disciplinary action taken against him. The Electricity Department is the subject of unending criticism and I recently arranged for an expert oommittee which the Bahrain Petroleum Company very kindly provided to overhaul their activities for the last 10 years. They produced an admirable report in which they stated that although the technical side of the work had not been badly done, yet nevertheless, the accounting and administrative side of the project was inefficient in the extreme. The fact ie that the , working, and in hie limited way undoubtedly efficient. He „ - Vi-im now and all that can be done not be possible to replace him now cUiu. ' • . ? ■ v 1 ' •' # ' ■ / isoa lloO ig to that the GonEnittee' s recoraiaendations are carried out • He is an in stance of a person who was reasonably efficient 10 years ago but who has gone to seed during 10 years in Bahrain without adequate expert supervision. The Education Department is under reorganisation as a result of investigations initiated hy Weightman and considerable progress has been raade. When the present Director made hie original investigation he disclosed facts regarding primary education which reflected no credit upon BeIgrave as the head of the administration# (d) I think this is substantially correct, fhe idea that the public have a right of access to responsible officials and an equal right to air all genuine grievances has not yet taken root in Bahrain* and the Shaikhly state of mind seems to prevail in which any unfavourable coraraent is considered subversive# This attitude is not unknown in Indian states# but wherever instances occur I will take notice of them. Arabs are not usually slow in voicing grievances and a shaikh is normally 'on view* to the public at a fixed time evexy day? s. salutary custom whi-n ha..-, its counterpart with the Moghuls. Shaikh Hansad used to Bee efpolice ■ at least twice a week when he came to the Joint Court, but latterly tendid to shirk this duty* He has, however, now resumed his attendance. (e) You areaware of the proposals that have been made from time to time regarding the lolice and it is unfortunate that an officer of the Indian Polioe was not seconded when the proposal was originally made. Owing to financial stringency I was obliged to recomiaend in 1931 that the then commandant of Police, Parks, should be dip* pensed with and since then they have been xun as a side /show0 '[v |6I 5- sliow W Belgrave in re turn for an allowance of B8*100/- a vonth• Be Igrave knows nothing about Jrolioe work, andt finally# as a- «stilt of Weightisan^o ineietenoe he allowed Hallo*® to sake inyeetigatione which disclosed a very large number of abuses. Alban has arranged for Jackson to give further adTice and follow up the matter where Hallows left off» and I hope that some iuproveiaent will gradually take place • I as afraid that until a fully qualified Police officer has put in about 3 years hard work the Police will never be a credit to the adsinistration. They had a poor start in the shape of Parke who was really a broken-down soldier, and apart from the late Haji Suleiman a local detective of genius# were no credit to anybody# (f) The State Medical Department is popular and Dr. Snow is very well spoken of, though I am not so impressed with the lady doctor. The hospital is an extraordinary structure, a pot pourri of about ten different doctors 5 iu.e&amp;s, and it ^s regrettable that expert ad'/ice was not xakeis from the govern ment of India before so much money was spent on it. The work has been badly carried out by the building supervisor, who is a retired iVtf.D. subordinate, and the roofs already leak like sieves. J am unable to discover how far the State ^n meer is interested in building, but this construction reSJfects no credit on any one. 3. This remark may be liberally discounted, but nevertheless there is something in it. iiloan spends a great deal of with the local inhabitants and is ouch liked toy tbt* and he hears a great deal that should Imve reached Belgrave^e e^rs but does not. As an officer of our service he is well aware that he is meant to be '•accessible'' to the public even takes up time that he would prefer to spend in other ways. : i t W / ^ %C '33 ) 1 &gt; **Qm I emphatia&amp;lly agree with this view# le are blaiaed in pfrsia for having landed thea with Reaa Shahj, and it is guite oertai» that we are blaised in Bahrain for any defects in the s tate administration* How oan it he said that we do not interfere in Bahrain ? We deposed the late Ruler, introduced British officials and have regulated the finances for^c_yer sixteen years. While the Political Agent should not A Interfere in the administration beyond tendering advice in appropriate quarters, it is his business to redress genuine grievances, more especially when presented in the form of legitimate appeals. Svery case to which Alban has drawn my attention ao far has been one which required investigation or action on the part of the State and in each case his views have been borne out by the facts. In the matter of the electrical Department, the expert committee entirely suppotted the tentative views that he had formed.

Khalifah bin Ali is one of the sons of Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah bin Daij Alkhalifah who is the President of the Majlis Tijarah and takes a fairly active part in local affairs. Khalifah bin Ali was employed as an Arabic teacher and Secretary by Mr. Thornburg and went to America about a year ago in the employment of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. It was intended that he should stay there for a year. Previously he and one of his brothers were students in an American School in Baghdad. ✓ When he left Bahrain his political views were not anti-British. I have heard, unofficially, that he has been expressing himself very strongly, on the boat which he travelled in, as being in sympathy with the Arabs in Palestine and Iraq. Yours sincerely, Sd. C.

I happened to see Abdullah bin Zaid, Editor of the 'Al Bahrain', yesterday and took the opportunity, as suggest ed by you in paragraph 3 of your letter, of mentioning that I had heard rumours of anti-British talks by Shaikh Mohammad bin 'Isa and that I was very surprised at this. Abdullah bin Zaid is distantly related to Shaikh Mohammad and I thought that anything mentioned to him would very soon reach the latter 1 s ears. 3. To-day I had a message from Belgrave that Shaikh Mohammad would like to call on me and I accordingly received him. He was in a bit of a flutter and explained that Abdullah bin Zaid had told him what ^ passed yesterday. He said that he and his family had always been the closest friends of the British and that he could not possibly think how anyone would want to make such reports against him. He spoke at great length about his happy associations with various/- Hon 'ble Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C. I. S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.various Political Officers in the past and said that he could never countenance any anti-British feeling in his presence. I said that I have merely been hearing rumours for some time and that I was very glad to hear him say that there was no truth in them and that this was only to be expected from a member of the A1 Khalifah family. 4. I think that, as you say, his reaction was pro bably that of a small town Shaikh to travel and excessive flattery rather than to deeper seated anti-British feeling and I hope that we shall see an improvement in the future. His attitude will continue to be observed and reported. Yours sincerely. kj. (2^. IGcpy sent to G.of 1.under d,o.P.L.No.C/239 d: 30.6.41, copy of bare P.I,sent to P.A.Bhn.)D.O.

C/346 dated the 23rd April 1940 regarding Judge Lloyd ? |p. 10^ 2. I have been discussing the matter with Belgrave and I understand that Judge Lloyd is now serving with the Intelli gence Department in Iraq and will presumably not be available for Bahrain, It occurred to me that there is a remote possi bility of the Aden Government having someone either British, Indian or Arab with a good knowledge of law whom they could lend to us for the purpose of framing some simple codes of procedure for the guidance of the Bahrain Courts. Such a v man would know Arabic and would also be familiar with the Indian Codes, which would be a great help as people who are accustomed to other systems have a tendency to try and introduce them. If this suggestion is not good, then there only remain Arab countries such as Palestine, Egypt and the Sudan and in these countries other systems of law prevail. 3* I am inclined to think that a really good. Indian might perhaps be the best solution after all. Most Indians have 1 i studied Arabic as a classical language in *&gt;1 ' ege and University and should not have such great difficulty in acquiring a sufficient knowledge of the language to carry on their work in Bahrain. 4. In addition to framing Civil codes of procedure, he would also be required to alter the Sudan Penal Code so as to make it suitable for Bahrain. I believe that the name w Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C. I. E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sudan /- o. SSudan Penal Code has caused the under current of objection to it since local inhabitants appear to have no objection to the Indian Penal Code and would indeed welcome it although they do not like the Sudan Code which is practically identical. I think the reason for this is that there are still a certain number of Sudanese descendants of slaves in the Island and that if the v/ord Sudan is entirely dropped the objection would disappear. In addition to framing codes I think the Legal Expert should also conduct classes in order to show the magistrates how to deal with cases properly. He could also overhaul the machinery of the Courts and the office routine etc. 5. I suggest that Belgrave might perhaps write to Ingrams whom he knows and ask him whether any one can be procured from Aden and if the reply were favourable the matter could be taken up by us with the Aden Authorities. If this fails we might proceed to try and get a suitable Legal Expert through the Government of India. \ # Yours sincerely,Confidential* Office of the Political Heeident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain* D«0«Ho»C/237 Dated the 30th June, 1941• Dear Alban, t |Cr \ nB Please refer to your demi-official letter Bo*C/636, dated the 19th June 194!• I am afraid that Aden will not be able to help you -very much aa their own judicial ay at em ie in a aomewhat chaotic condition* There ia, however, no objection to BeIgraye writing to Ingrama and seeing if there ia any one there who could be conaidered for we need not take him unleaa he appeara fully aatiafactory* It occura to me that Zanzibar might produce some one useful and if he wiahea I could write to the Resident there * 2* We may aa well give up the idea of finding an Indian \ who has sufficient knowledge of Arabic to do this work in Bahrain* I imported a Muslim tutor for the Shaikh*a eons in 1929 under the impreaaion that a knowledge of Arabic acqtuired in India would be aufficient for Bahrain, but found that it took him nowhere* If we employ an Indian it will be with the knowledge that hi a attaint ii^ts in Arabic are of little value* 3* Paleatine and Egypt will, I am afraid, be of no use to us as their system of law is based on the Ottoman codes, which are quite different to the Indian system* It occurs to me, however, that we might secure an officer on deputation from the Sudan as their codes and conditions approximate to our requirements, and if desired I will approach them* ¥/e might obtain copies of their Civil Procedure Code in any case unless you already have it* Yours sincerely.

He has been advanced Rs. 15/- for passage and given a permit to land at Bahrain. - BRITGONSUL - AVMSheikh Ali bin Khalifah al Fadhle; V.C. In October, 1938, this gentleman induced the workmen of the Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., to go on strike with a view to forming a union for them and he snouxa tc the head of it. His Government - the Government of Bahrain - sentenced him to four years' banishment to the Hedjaz where he was sent to in February, 1939. No subsidy was fixed for him consequently he got into debts there and went to Kuwait where he borrowed money from his friends and paid up his debts to his creditors in the Hedjaz. Seeing tiitit. in Ku.vai t also he could not go on borrowing money he went to the Political Agent there and requested for a remisbion of his sentence. He was informed that the period of his banishment, on receipt of his petition in Bahrain, was raised by five years during which he should not return to Bahrain. Being thus disappointed in his own Government he went to Basrah and requested the Iranian Consul there 5SJ for an entry visa which was arranged for him through the Iranian Minister in Baghdad. He went to Tehran where he met a member of the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and explained his affairs, and said he v/anted to be trading with the Arab countries and he was given assurances that he will be given the necessary facilities ,■ ■ ■ j. ' for the purpose. By these facilities, he says, he meant that he should be able to get an exit visa for going out of Iran whenever he wanted to leave the country and also that he should be at Bushire where he could lay his case before the Political Resident for favourable consideration.
