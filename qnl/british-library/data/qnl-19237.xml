Goldfinch, having under date the 8th February last. No. 206, addressed this department with a view to the establishment of certain fixed Rules for the future regulation of promotion among the Native servants of his Collectorate, my predecessor deemed it necessary, before laying so important a proposition before Government, to consult the other Collectors of the Division upon the subject; and for this purpose Mr. Goldfinch's letter, with the one from Captain Wingate (dated the 6th idem. No. 54) which accompanied it, was circulated on the 21st idem. No. 1033. 2.

I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) E. G. FAWCETT, Revenue Commissioner, S. D. No. 206 of 1851. To E. H. TOWNSEND, Esq., Revenue Commissioner, S. D. Sir, In submitting tli£ annexed correspondence regarding the introduction of certain Rules for the regulation of promotion among the Native servants of the Collectorate, I venture to hope that you will forward it to Government, supported with your approval and recommendation for adoption. 2. I have long felt very strongly the necessity for some fixed Rules to regulate promotion, which the Service may depend upon being enforced, or the tenor of which may lead the Native subordinates to the conviction that they are the members of a public service, that they have rights as such which cannot be affected by the favour( 2 ) or dislike of any one individual; and that good conduct and long service must lead to promotion to a certain extent, and that it they possess abilities qualif ying them to fill the higher appointments, they will have an opportunity of displaying them. 3. The absence of Mr. Bell on leave has given me an opportunity of expressing my sentiments, but before addressing you I judged it expedient to obtain Captain Wingate's opinion on the subject. There are few men who have had greater opportunity of forming an opinion, or whose opinion, when expressed, is entitled to more considera tion ; it is therefore with much satisfaction that I observe the cordial manner in which Captain Wingate approves of my suggestion. 4. I feel convinced that your own experience will bear testimony to the truth of the existence of a general, almost universal opinion that obtains among the Native establish ment, that their success or failure depends upon the favour of some iSative official ; and I think that you will concur in the opinion that the prevalence of this notion cannot but have a most injurious and demoralizing effect. 5. I earnestly hope that Government will be induced to sanction the introduction ot the Rules suggested in my letter into this Collectorate, if only as an experiment. I feel sure that they will prove productive of great good ; but should experience teach othei - wise, they can easily be abolished. 6. I will only add, that if these Rules are introduced, nothing but the most stringent orders from Government regarding their rigid observance will suffice ; not the slightest deviation, except on special report, and Government sanction, must be permitted. I he\ will not prove equally palatable to all, and it is probable that efforts to evade them will be made, and if once an infringement of them be permitted, they will become a dead letter. The Rules laid down for the admission of candidates for (xovernment service in the rank in which they pass the examination have not been invariably adhered to, and therefore I urge the necessity of the most stringent orders. There must be no discretionary power vested in the head of the office—the strict Rules must be adhered to. Let them be once broken in favour of an individual and all confidence in them will be lost; the notion of the reign of favour will again prevail, and ail the good that may be anticipated from the introduction of these Rules will be swept away. 1 have the honour to be, kc. (Signed) W. A. GOLDFINCH, First Assistant Collector in charge. Dharwar, Collector s Office, 8^ Fehruanj 1851. No. 176 of 1851. To C aptain G. WINGATE, Superintendent of the Southern Mahratta Country Survey. Sm, I contemplate proposing for the sanction and approval of Government some Rules foi regulating promotion among the Native servants on the establishment of this'Collectorate, and as you have had ample opportunity of forming an opinion on the subject, I wish, before proceeding further in the matter, to submit the plan for your consideration, being confident that should the suggestion meet with your approbation. Government will be inclined to sanction its adoption.( 3 ) 2. •\ ou are aware that now there is no system of promotion : on a vacancy occurring the situation is filled up by the Collector, and, as it is quite impossible that he can know the qualifications of all the lower grades of servants, from amongst whom the selection must be made, it is usual to consult the Dufturdar, who is supposed to know the merits of all, and his advice is generally taken as to the choice of the man to be promoted. That this is the case is well known throughout the service, and however conscientious the Dufturdar may be in giving his opinion, those men who are passed over will never give him credit for honesty of purpose, but will attribute some unworthy motive to him ; and hence arises the impression, which is general, that a man's advance ment in the service depends, not so much upon his own good conduct and ability, as upon the favour of the Dufturdar, or other Native official, who may be supposed to influence the Collector in his distribution of patronage. 3. In cases where the Collector calls for the opinion of his Assistant within whose charge the vacancy may occur, the same custom obtains in a smaller scale: it is very seldom that the Assistant comes in contact, or has any opportunity for forming an opinion of the qualifications of Karkoons below the rank of Second or Third Karkoon in a Mamlutdar's Cutcherry ; and hence, if he is called upon to name a man below that rank for promotion, he must inquire of the Mamlutdar of the Talooka who is the most fit, or, if lie does not choose to follow that course, as in most cases he will not think it prudent, he will pitch upon some one who has been accidentally brought to his notice, though for all he knows many more deserving men may be passed over. 4. It is no uncommon sight to see an old gray-headed man, who has been from his youth in the service, holding a 10 or 12 rupee place in a Mamlutdar's Cutcherry. An inquiry as to the reason of his never having risen higher will elicit the reply that he has no friends ; there has been no one to speak for him ; he never had an opportunity of attracting the notice of the Saheb, and therefore he has gone on from youth to manhood, and from manhood to old age, unnoticed and unknown, with no hope of rising, and, indeed, after a time, unfit to rise—an inefficient, unwilling, and most probably a dishonest servant. Such a man attributes his failure in life to want of luck in not having secured the favour of some one, and under the present system, or rather no system, no man, however deserving he may be, can be sure that his fate will not be that of the old man above described ; and to avoid it he will, as the only means he knows, strive all he can to obtain the personal favour, no matter how, of the individual whom he is taught to look upon as the dispenser of good things. From this arises that waiting upon persons, and cogging anxiety to attract notice, which you cannot fail to have remarked, and which is a very different demeanour from what might be expected from a member of a public service, who is conscious that he has rights as a public servant, and knows that his success or failure does not depend upon the favour or humour of any one individual. 5. The theory of the present system is that the head of the office, being quite un trammelled, has the opportunity of advancing men for merit ; but in practice it must be what I have described. The Collector, constantly changed, cannot know anything of the merits of the lower ranks of the service, whom he never sees or hears of, and he must ask the opinion of some one, and whoever that some one may be, all promotion in the Native estimation depends upon that individual's favour—he becomes the centre of the hopes and fears of the whole establishment, and the public service becomes a kind of preserve for the exercise of individual patronage. 6. I have long been of opinion that this uncertainty of promotion in the service is/ ( 4 ) one great reason of the comparatively low standard of honesty among the lower grades, and I think that more can be done towards raising this standard by the introduction of some system of promotion which may tend to encourage a feeling of independence, and teach the service that they have rights as public servants, irrespective ot the favour of individuals, and by which every man will know that by good conduct and long service he must rise to certain height of advancement, than by any other measure that can be adopted. With this impression, I would propose for adoption the following Rules :— 7. All candidates for public service to be examined, as at present, and to enter the service in the rank in which they stand. I think, that with the qualifications these men must possess, and the knowledge of the mode of conducting business that they will soon acquire, we may presume that they will be competent to fill all the situations up to a certain height. This limit I propose to be the 18 rupee situations : up to that point the promotion should go by seniority. When a man attains a 20 rupee situation, he be comes the Second Karkoon in a Mamlutdar's, and First Karkoon in a Mahalkurry's Cutcherry, and it may happen that he will be called upon to conduct the duties ot either of these offices during the temporary absence of his superiors. 1 propose, there fore, that after a man has risen to Rs. 18, he be examined, and unless pronounced by a Committee competent to fill the higher offices, he remain at Rs. 18, the junior men who may be pronounced competent being promoted over his head. The Committee to con sist of the Collector, his Assistants, and Dufturdar, and the examination to take place once a year, in the rains. 8. The men who are examined and found fit will be promoted to the higher offices as they become vacant by seniority, and should it afterwards appear that any man, notwithstanding his examination, prove by experience to be unfit for the higher offices, he will be put down to the 18 rupee rank, from which he will not emerge. 9. It will be easy to draw up the precise Rules to be observed after the principle is sanctioned: the above contain the essentials, which are security for every man being promoted to a certain height, and an opportunity of showing whether he is capable of filling the higher offices of Mahalkurry and Mamlutdar. A corrected lithographed list of the service to be published once or twice a year ; a copy to be furnished to every Cutcherry from the Petty Supply Fund, and to be sold to any one who chooses to buy them at a price to cover the expense of paper and ink. 10. It is absolutely necessary that the Rules, if established, be most strictly enforced, and that not the slightest deviation, except in the cases of very meritorious persons, allowed ; but every such case must be reported to Government, and sanction obtained for every proposed deviation. This must be insisted upon most rigidly : no Rules will be observed without it. The necessity of writing a report will prevent the Rules being broken without good reason ; while in a case of extraordinary merit, it is to be hoped that no one will grudge the trouble of writing to obtain the means of rewarding it. 11. The servants on the Hoozoor establishment to form exceptions to these Rules. Their duties are peculiar, and only to be acquired by long practice ; but in the case of a Iloozoor Karkoon being sent to the districts, he will, if drawing higher pay than Rs. 18, have to undergo an examination, and if not pronounced competent to fill the higher appointment, to be reduced to the 18 rupee rank, until he can qualify himself; if in the receipt of lower pay than Rs. 18, he will take his place according to his length of service.( 5 ) '3# 1*2. • Should you agree in the propriety of the principle of the above Rules, I propose to submit them for Government sanction without delay. I have the honour to be, &amp;,c. (Signed) W. A. GOLDFINCH, First Assistant Collector in charo-e. Dharwar, Collector s Office, \th February 1851. No. 54 of 1851. To W. A. GOLDFINCH, Esq., First Assistant Collector in char ore. Sir, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 176, dated 4th instant, in which you do me the honour of requesting my opinion on certain Rules for regulating promo tion among the Native servants of this Collectorate, which you are desirous of seeing introduced, and contemplate submitting for the approval and sanction of Government. 2. In reply, I beg to express my cordial concurrence in all your views, which, if fully carried out, will, I am satisfied, prove of the utmost service in raising the character ol our Native revenue servants. 3. I can add little to the clear and conclusive reasons adduced in your letter in support ot the Rules you suggest for adoption ; but as, in the course of my duties, I have seen a great deal of the district establishments, both in this province and in the Deccan, and had good opportunities of learning something of their feeling as to their position and prospects, it may not be superfluous to state my conviction that there is a very general or rather universal conviction among them, that their advancement does not depend so much on the manner in which their duties are performed, as upon their being able to secure the favour of some Native official, who is supposed to exert the greatest influence over the Collector, or Assistant Collector, as the case may be. 4. The existence of this general feeling is not only destructive of all independence, and often of honesty too, in those actuated by it, as fully illustrated in your letter, but is at same time highly prejudicial to the general management of the Collectorate, by substituting, for the ostensible governance of the European Collector, the indirect but not the less felt rule of an irresponsible Native official. Though the latter be honest, the hurtful effect of his influence is not thereby averted ; but if he be dishonest, it spreads like a corrupting virus through the whole circle of the district Native officials, none of whom hopes to brave such an influence without risking his own reputation with the Collector, and thenefore, however honestly inclined, does not attempt to do so. The whole fabric of the Collector's authority may be thus undermined, while the exterior seems to him fair and sound, and there seems to be as little reason for questioning the evils of such a state of things as the fact of their being in great measure due to the manner in which promotion among the members of the Native establishments is now effected. 5. The Rules you suggest seem well calculated to remedy these evils, and I do not see how they could fail of placing the members of the district establishments in a position( 6 ) of far greater independence than they occupy at present; while I am satisfied that they vrould at the same time ensure the higher offices being filled by better qualified persons than are obtained under the present plan of promotion, in which merit is supposed to have the first place. It would be quite indispensable, however, to the success of the new plan, to prevent, by an absolute prohibition, as pointed out in your 10th paragraph, any infraction of the Rules, without the previously obtained sanction of Government. 6. The circumstances of the Dharwar Collectorate, now almost completely surveyed and assessed, seem peculiarlv favourable for giving effect to measures calculated to per fect our system of revenue administration, and I sincerely hope that Government will make an experiment there of the plan of promotion you suggest, which bids fair to be productive of the best results, and could not, I think, by possibility do harm.

For the reasons stated by Mr. Goldfinch and Captain Wingate, I am of opinion that it would be advisable to establish some Rules for regulating promotion among the Native .servants. 2. I would propose, that the suggestions conveyed Paragraph 7 of Mr. Goldfinch's letter, in the 7th paragraph of Mr. Goldfinch's letter be fully carried out.( 7 ) 3. *1 am not prepared to recommend the adoption of the system proposed in the 8th paragraph of Mr. Goldfinch's letter, neither does it appear very clear what is the mean- ino- intended to be conveyed in that paragraph by the words ' will be promoted to the higher offices as they become vacant.' If it is intended that all persons who have passed the second examination are by seniority to rise to the situation of Mahalkurry or Mam- lutdar, I do not think that the plan will work well; as a person may be a very good Karkoon or Accountant, or in fact qualified to hold any subordinate appointment, and yet at the same time he may not possess sufficient firmness or confidence in himself to enable him to conduct the duties of head of a department, such for instance as Mam- lutdar. Police Amuldar, or even Mahalkurry. Again, a man may be very clever, and pass a first-rate examination, and yet not be fit for a high situation, in consequence of his being dishonest or indolent. (Signed) R. SPOONER, Collector. Ahnednugyur, Collector's Camp at Slngwa Tookaee, 21th February 1851. No. 205 of 1851. The Collector of Sholapore does not concur in the observations of Mr. Goldfinch, and for himself and office denies the imputation that favouritism, or a blind reliance on the advice and opinion of any European or Native subordinate, regulates promotion among the inferior grades of Karkoons. There is no reason why a Collector or Assistant should not make himself acquainted with the qualifications of every individual on his establish ment. To do so is one of his first duties, for without a knowledge of the material at his disposal, an effective administration at his hands is impossible. A Collector or Assistant who does not exercise his own discretion and judgment, and does not exhibit the purest motives in dispensing the little patronage at his disposal, is unfit for the trust reposed in him, and ought to be removed. The Collector's experience has not yet shown him the ' no uncommon sight of the old gray-headed man who from lack of friends has been from his youth in the service holding a ten or twelve rupee place in a Mamlutdar's Cutcherry.' He therefore considers Mr. Goldfinch's picture overdrawn. Neither does the Collector's experience bear out Mr. Goldfinch's assertion of the ' almost universal opinion that obtains among the Native establishment, that their success or failure depends upon the favour of some Native official.' The numerous applications for appoint ments, personal as well as written, which the Collector has received, and still receives, lead him to the conclusion, that where access to the European functionary is at all times easy, the intermediate assistance of Native friends is not even thought of. 2. Mr. Goldfinch proposes by his Rules to do away with the uncertainty of promo tion, and thereby to raise the comparatively low standard of honesty among the lower grades. The Collector believes that not the slightest uncertainty of promotion exists where real merit is to be found, and that the standard of honesty depends upon moral culture much more than upon the remedy which is designed to rectify its alleged low state. 3. In regard to the Rules themselves, there is nothing in them which at present a Collector is not at liberty of himself to carry out. When in Belgaum, the Collector of Sholapore, at the annual examination of candidates for employment, invited all Karkoons ambitious of preferment to exhibit their qualifications, and rendered the ordeal of an examination imperative upon all whom he considered unfits.( s ) 4. The Collector is of opinion that Chapter II. Regulation XVI. ol 1827*, which regulates the appointment, suspension, and dismissal of all Native subordinates, is ({uite adequate for every purpose, and that the passing of Rules and Bye-laws which would supersede the law of the land would be highly injudicious. A Collector's success in his administration depends as much upon the local consideration in which he is held, as on the support he receives from Government, grounded upon its opinion of his character and motives. Full control over the material with which he works, as well as the harmo nious co-operation of every member of his establishment, is indispensable to ensure success ; and therefore the Collector deprecates any diminution ol the limited patronage or control he now exercises over his subordinates. 5. The Collector does not see the line of distinction drawn by Mr. Goldfinch between servants on the Hoozoor and district establishments. What is advantageous for one ought to be the same for the other. 6. In fine, the Collector, while recording his strong disapproval of Mr. Goldfinch's observations and Rules, would express his conviction that every right-thinking man will always give its full weight to seniority ; but that the Collector himsell must still remain the best judge of the individual most fit for advancement on the occurrence of a vacancy. With these views, the Collector thinks it would be the worst of policies to prevent, by the promulgation of a series of Rules never to be deviated from, the exercise of that discretion and discernment, debarred the use of which a controlling officer becomes little better than a mere machine. (Signed) J. D. INVERARITY, Collector. Sholapore, Collector s Camp, Temhoornce, 12M March 1851. No. 308 of 1851. The arrangement proposed by Mr. Goldfinch was brought forward by myself, under date 22nd September 1846, No. 576, and was approved of by that officer, and also, I believe, by Government. 2. Rotation up to the grade of a Karkoon is now always the rule in this Collectorate. After that, however, it would be useless to observe it, as no advantage can possibly occur from promoting a man to the office of a Head Karkoon, Mahalkurry, or Mamlutdar, who is utterly unfit for it; and no examination will sufficiently test the qualifications necessary for such offices. I would, therefore, rather see these situations still left in my charge, to be considered as exceptions to the general rule. (Signed) H. W. REEA ES, Collector. Belyaum, Collector s Camp, Koonkoomhee, Sth April 1851. No. 550 of 1851. The Collector of Rutnagherry does not think that the Rules proposed by Mr. Gold finch would be easily introduced in this Collectorate, or that they are necessary. The( 9 ) Collectftr agrees in many of the remarks made by the Collector of Sholapore, and is of opinion that Collectors and their Assistants are much less guided by their Native offieials than Mr. Goldfinch imagines. The Collector of Rutnagherry has always kept by him a list of his establishment, and has endeavoured, as much as possible, to make himself acquainted even with the lowest grades of Karkoons, and when vacancies occur, carries out the system of seniority Mr. Goldfinch proposes to introduce. By the permis sion of his successor, deputed Assistants have power to promote all Karkoons on the establishments under their control who draw a smaller salary than Rs. 25 per mensem, which the Collector considers must induce Assistants to make themselves acquainted with the Karkoons in the Mamlutdars' and Mahalkurries' Cutcherries. As to consulting a Dufturdar or a Mamlutdar, the Collector sees no objection to such a measure, where he wishes to learn something of the qualifications of persons who have served under them, but doubts much any Collector invariably depending upon them, or taking their opinions on the occurrence of every vacancy. The Collector thinks there would be much incon venience in carrying out the measure also, as it would make such continual changes in the Mamlutdar's Cutcherry : those on the lowest pay generally get promotion as vacancies occur in the establishment in which they are employed, the higher grades only being transferred as situations fall vacant. Stamp Venders and Tulatees in this Collectorate are always happy to change, but nine rupee Karkoons would object to get increase of pay by taking either of these situations. Not many Karkoons would wil lingly move from a ten rupee appointment in any other part of the Collectorate to take a twelve rupee one at Bankote; and all Karkoons would prefer being at a Soobha Station rather than in a Mahal, where there are few to perform the duties. If seniority is to be the system, the Collector of Rutnagherry thinks the whole of the Collector's department should be thrown open to the measure, and that it should not be restricted to Mamlut dars' and Mahalkurries' Cutcherries. The examination candidates are called on to pass should fit them for any situations under Rs. 25, whether it is in the Chitnees' Duftur, or other office. (Signed) G. COLES, Collector.

The Acting Collector of Poona has the honour to state, that the result of much attention which he has given for a good many years past to the subject now under consideration in these papers could not be more forcibly presented to view than by the Report written by the Collector of Sholapore above appended. There is not a word in that Report in which the Acting Collector of Poona does not fully concur, and with a profound sense of the .enormous mischief occasioned by bad appointments, he conceives that the extension in the present instance of that part of our system which consists in the enactment on every subject of Rules to fetter the action of the responsible executive officers of the Government would, in his humble opinion, be highly unadvisable.

Sir, In acknowledging the receipt of extracts of correspondence forwarded with your memorandum Xo. 2188, dated 17 th instant, I have the honour to remark, in reference to M( 11 ) the observations made by the Collector of Ahmednuggur, that the meaning of the words 41 will be promoted to the higher offices as they become vacant,' used in Mr. Gold finch's 8th paragraph, clearly is, that such Karkoons as pass the second examination are to be promoted to higher situations as they become vacant by seniority ; that is to say, in the first instance lo a Second Karkoon's place in a Mamlutdar's or a First place in' a Mahalkurry's Cutcherry, and subsequently, should they be found to acquit them selves creditably in these positions, to higher situations. Should they fail, however, in any of these posts, their promotion is to cease, and they are to be remanded to the posi tion of an 18 rupee Karkoon. The latter provision appears to have been overlooked by Mr. Spooner, and completely meets the objections urged by him against the scheme, on the score of a person being qualified for a subordinate appointment, and yet not possessing sufficient firmness or confidence in himself to conduct the duties of the head of a department, or of being very clever, and yet not fit for a high situation, in conse quence of being dishonest or indolent. 2. Had the Collector a perfect knowledge of the characters and qualifications of all the subordinate District Karkoons, which would seem indispensable to giving effect to Mr. Spooner's views, nothing more would be requisite to enable him to regulate pro motion in the most fitting manner ; but the real question is, how is the Collector to obtain this information ? Is it better for him to trust to the results of a systematic examination of the candidates, or to lend his ear to the suggestions of a Dufturdar or Chitnees ? Is it preferable to afford those who have proved themselves at a public examination before the chief European and Native revenue authorities to possess certain qualifications, to show by actual experiment whether they are fitted for the higher situations of which these qualifications give promise ,* or to run the risk of passing over and condemning to hopeless obscurity deserving men, who may have had no opportunity of attracting the notice of the Collector, or had the still greater misfortune of incurring the enmity of those about him ? 3. These observations apply also to the remarks by the Collector of Belgaum. If no examination will sufficiently test the qualifications required to fit a person for the not very responsible offices of a Second Karkoon in a jVIamlutdar s oi a Fust in a Alahalkun \ s Cutcherry, in what more satisfactory way does the Collector now ascertain these ? If he have not, and cannot have, in nine cases out of ten, a personal knowledge of the candidates, it seems inevitable that he must either adopt the recommendation of some one to whom he may apply for information, or make a selection at random. Are either of these methods more to be depended on than the systematic examination recom mended by Mr. Goldfinch ? 4. In regard to the observations made by the Collectors of Sholapore and Rutna- gherry, I am of opinion that there are sufficient reasons for excepting Hoozoor Karkoons from the operation of the Rules ; for, so long as they remain in that situation, they are thrown into constant contact with their immediate European superiors, who can rarely be in any doubt ^s to which of them is most deserving of promotion in event of any vacancy occurring. On occasion of their removal to the Talooka establishment, Mr. Goldfinch's 11th paragraph provides for their coming under the operation of the Rules. The same may be said of Karkoons in the Dufturdar's Cutcherry. The question raised by these Collectors, however, is not one of principle, but of detail. Should the scheme be found to answer as regards the Talooka establishments, the expediency of extending it to the Hoozoor establishments might probably be considered with greater advantage than at present.( 12 ) 5. I avail myself, in conclusion, of this opportunity to reiterate my conviction of the important advantages that would result from the adoption ot Mr. Goldfinch s scheme, and anxiously hope that it may be thought deserving ot being fairly tried.

Sir, With reference to your memorandum No. 2188, dated the 17th ultimo, transmitting extracts of Reports from the Collectors of Ahmednuggur, Belgaum, Sholapore, and Rutnagherry, upon the system of promotion in the xSative department, proposed to be introduced into this Collectorate by Mr. Goldfinch, I have the honour to forwaid &lt;i cop\ of that Officer's opinion and Report upon the remarks by the several Collectors above alluded to. I have the honour to be, &amp;.c. (Signed) J. S. LAW, Collector. No. 2474 of 1851. Poona, Revenue Commissioner s Office, \^th June 1851. The Collector of Dharwar is requested to favour the Revenue Commissioner with his opinion on Mr. Goldfinch's proposition. At the same time, he will be good enough to request Mr. Goldfinch to state how many instances of undue neglect of meritorious servants have come under his observation, and to name the persons he refers to. (Signed) E. G. FAWCETT, Revenue Commissioner, S. D. No. 1620 of 1851. Dharwar, Collector s Office, 20th September 1851. After having given much consideration to the subject, I am unable to concur in the advisability of the measure proposed by Mr. Goldfinch, even as an experiment. At the same time, I allow that this, as well as other parts of our administration, is susceptible( 13 ) of improvement; but I do not think the plan suggested by Mr. Goldfineli is well adapted to secure that end. 2. It will be observed from the accompanying copy of a letter from my First Assist ant, in reply to the reference made in accordance with the above endorsement, that he had no particular instances of undue neglect of meritorious servants in his recollection when he submitted his proposition. 3. I have frequently seen Cutcherry Karkoons who have for many years served in the lowest grades, while their juniors have been promoted ; but, except in a very few instances, it has always seemed to me that they had been properly .passed over. Of course, if we were to depend on their own account of the matter, we should have to believe that it is solely for want of patronage that they have not all risen to the rank of Mamlutdar. Even under a system of examinations much the same thing would occur, for the unsuccessful candidates would attribute their failure, not to their own want of ability, but to the partiality of the Native members of the Committee. I believe this idea to prevail to some extent, even with regard to the present preliminary examinations, and I have more than once heard it remarked that the relations and connexions of Duftur- dars, Sudder Ameens, and other high Native officials, were always sure to pass, and to stand among the first in the lists. This, however, may usually be accounted for by such persons having had the advantage of a superior education. 4. As there may be some doubt on the point, I beg to explain that I have ascertained from Mr. Goldfinch that his intention is, that the lower paid Karkoons should rise by seniority with reference to their standing in the whole Collectorate, and not in each separate Cutcherry. 5. Such a system, I would submit, must tend to deprive the inferior Karkoons of the principal motive they now have, or ought to have, for a diligent and faithful dis charge of their duties, viz. the desire to obtain the good opinion of their immediate superiors, on whose recommendation their prospects of speedy promotion must at present more or less depend. If they feel that they are sure of a certain degree of promotion, independently of such recommendation, it may be expected that many of them will not be inclined to do more than is enough to avoid disgrace, and that the Mamlutdars will consequently have much difficulty in getting their work efficiently performed. 6. In the case of the lower paid Cutcherry Karkoons, I have always been in the habit of paying much attention to the recommendations of the Mamlutdars, unless I had any reasons for distrusting them ; at the same time, in case of extensive promotions, making frequent transfers between the Hoozoor and the districts, and between one district and another. It is obviously the true interest of a Mamlutdar to have efficient subordinates, for, with a set of incapable Karkoons, how are his multifarious duties to be performed ? Accordingly, when deserving individuals have been passed over, I think it will be found to have been chiefly owing to the opinions of their immediate superiors not having been sufficiently consulted. 7. What is mos^ important to guard against in such cases is the tendency to nepo tism, which is so apt to warp the judgment of our Native officials, and to restrict the distribution of patronage to certain families ; but a sufficient check seems to be provided in the periodical returns bearing on this point, which are now furnished to your department. 8. The most objectionable part of the scheme, however, appears to me to be the promotion to the higher offices by seniority of those who have passed the examination. Mr. Goldfinch allows that no examination will sufficiently test the qualifications( 14 ) necessary for the offices of Mamlutdar, Mahalkurry, See., but thinks that these can only he ascertained hij trial. Now it appears to me, that with a very moderate degree of insight into character, the Collector ought, after a short acquaintance, to be able to form a tolerably correct judgment of the fitness for promotion of the higher class of Native servants, and in the case of Mahalkurries and Head Karkoons especially, he must, in the ordinary course of business, have frequent opportunities of ascertaining, from the manner in which they perform their duties, which are the most worthy to be entrusted with more extended powers. 9. I would further submit that the proposed system must tend to diminish the influence of the Collector, which, as truly observed in the Government letter to your predecessor, dated 28th February 1849, No. 1487, ' is too low already. In the words ot the same letter—' We must be careful not to reduce everything to a mere matter of routine, which no one will have heart to carry out.' 10. Another objection to these Rules would be that they would prevent the Collector from filling up vacancies occasionally from other establishments, which has, I believe, always been considered a desirable practice, especially in the higher grades ol the Service. 11. What must now be considered the Standing Rules on this subject will be found in the letter from the sole Revenue Commissioner, Mr. Williamson, to Government, dated 15th October 1836, No. 2216. Supposing it is considered necessary to do anything further in the matter, I would submit that it should be on the principles of those Rules. 12. In this Collectorate, the examination of candidates for employment is held before the Officers of the Revenue Survey, assisted by the Collector's Dufturdar, and a Moonsiff, or other high Officer of the Court; those whose qualifications are rated at 12 annas and upwards being considered eligible for employment under the Collector, and the rest, provided they reach 8 annas, for employment on the Revenue Survey. The examination is, however, confined to reading and writing in Mahratta and Canarese, and arithmetic up to decimals. In other Collectorates, candidates are further examined in book-keeping, the Regulations, and the mode of conducting public business. A rudimentary knowledge of the first of these points might fairly be required before admittance to the Service, but perhaps it is not necessary to insist on the two latter, although all should, I think, have the option of being examined in them. 13. I find, that in consequence of this difference of system the attainments of those who have passed the examination here are rated at Belgaum at only half the amount, viz. 6 annas, and before they can be employed in that Collectorate they are required to pass a further examination in the above three points. Perhaps in some other Collectorates the test may vary more or less, and it would be well, I submit, to take measures for securing as much uniformity as possible in this respect. 14. Formerly, it was usual in the Belgaum Collectorate to invite those already in the Service to attend the annual examinations, the prospect of speedy promotion being held out to those who might distinguish themselves. This practice had an excellent effect, as will be seen from the annexed extract of a letter from Mr. Townsend, when Acting Collector of Belgaum, to Government, dated 10th December 1839, of which there is a copy on my records. If such a system were generally introduced, the examinations being open to all who might choose to attend below the rank of Mahalkurry and Head Karkoon of a Talooka, it would, I think, be attended with advantage. It would be necessary, however, that the test should vary in difficulty according to the rank of the candidate in the service. ^ 15. At the same time, it must be allowed that the best kind of test for those in the( 15 ) service 'is that of the work actually performed by them, of which the Collector and his Assistants may have frequent opportunities of judging for themselves, even as regards the lower paid servants, when examining the Talooka accounts and records, and the books of proceedings of District Police Officers.* If private memoranda were kept on such occasions, they would often be very useful for reference in filling up appointments. 16. With reference to the 7th paragraph of Mr. Goldfinch's letter dated 25th May last, I would observe, that whilst I agree with him that the principle of selection with out regard to seniority should under any circumstances be maintained as regards the Karkoons employed'immediately under the Collector and his Assistants, 1 am of opinion, that whatever inconvenience may sometimes be occasioned, these Karkoons, especially the Chitnees and Assistant Sheristadars, should frequently be changed. It is in this way that, as it appears to me, the growth of undue influence, whether as regards the distribution of patronage or any other matters, can most effectually be checked, and not by measures tending to limit the field of promotion, and to diminish the Collector's authority. 17. In conclusion, I beg to state that Mr. Goldfinch brought forward the same proposition on a former occasion, but it was not approved of by my predecessor, Mr. Bell, as will be seen on reference to the accompanying extract from his letter to his First Assistant, dated 4th July 1849, No. 991. (Signed) J. S. LAW, Collector. Despatched 23 rc/. To J. S. LAW, Esq., Collector, Dharwar. Sir, As directed in your memorandum No. 786, dated 23rd instant, beneath endorsement from the Revenue Commissioner, forwarding remarks by the Collectors of Ahmednug- gur, Belgaum, Sholapore, and Rutnagherry, on a system of promotion proposed by me to be introduced in this Collectorate as an expeiiment, I have the honour to forward my opinion and report. 2. The Collector of Ahmednuggur has rightly understood the meaning of the words ' will be promoted to the higher offices as they become vacant,' and I quite concur in the opinion that a person may be a very good Karkoon and Accountant, and fit to hold any subordinate situation, and at the same time not be qualified to conduct the duties of a head of a department; and a man may most undoubtedly be very clever, and at the same time indolent and dishonest;—but the circumstances of this last man will not be improved by the introduction of the proposed Rules : an indolent or dishonest man, who has been proved to be such, is not fit for any appointment, and might be degraded or dismissed under the proposed Rules the same as he may be now. 3. As regards the person who may be a good Karkoon, and yet not fit to fill the appointment of head of an office, I submit that efficiency in the subordinate situation of a Karkoon is the best, in fact the only, criterion by which we can judge of his fitness for a higher appointment; and until such a man has had an opportunity of displaying his * Vide Cirewlar No. 379 of the Sudder Foujdaree Adawlut.( 16 ) qualifications in a higher appointment, it is impossible that we can pronounce upon his fitness to hold it. Should he after his advancement fail in his duties, he will, as provided for in paragraph 8, revert to his original grade. I am perfectly well aware that the mere fact of a man's passing the required examination is no proof that he is fit to hold a Mamlut- darship, but I think that every man who can pass should have the opportunity of trying in his turn. The object of the examination is to discover whether the candidate has those qualifications which are indispensable to the efficient conduct of the duties of a higher office. If he does not possess these qualifications, then he certainly will not be promoted; if he has them, it is the object of the proposed Rules to insure his promotion, if he turns out to be fit for it. I presume that in Nuggur, as in this Collectorate, the Mamlutdar's and Mahalkurry's appointments are filled by the promotion of subordinates on the Collec tor's establishment. These subordinates must be either Writers, Karkoons, or Peons ; the efficient performance of any of the duties entrusted to these classes of servants will not prove any one of them to be fit for a Mamlutdar's or Mahalkurry's situation : how then is the fitness of the fortunate candidate discovered ? Does it never happen that the servant so advanced turns out to be unfit ? And when the selection does chance to be a happy one, what security is there that twenty others as well or better qualified, and of longer service, are not passed over ? 4. The Belgaum Collector remarks, that in Belgaum rotation up to the grade of a Karkoon is the rule, and that it would be useless to promote a man to the office of Head Karkoon, Mahalkurry, or Mamlutdar, who is utterly unfit for it, and that no examination will test the qualifications necessary for such offices. 5. If the rule of rotation up to a certain grade is rigidly enforced, and the higher offices filled by selections from this grade of the best qualified, length of service, other things being equal, giving the preference in the choice, the principles of the proposed Rules appear to be approved of and in force; and therefore, to perfect the system, nothing is required beyond promulgation of the Rules, as fixed, and in no case to be relaxed, except in special instances, with the sanction of Government, as provided tor in para graph 10 of my letter, and publication of a printed li^t of the service. The examination of the men who have attained the grade when the rotation system leaves off' would perhaps not appear objectionable, as it would tend to prevent the advancement to the higher grades of men who are utterly unfit. I have already expressed my concurrence in the opinion that no examination will sufficiently test the qualifications necessary for the offices of Mamlutdar, Mahalkurry, &amp;:c.; these can only be ascertained by trial. 6. The Collector of Sholapore does not see the line of distinction drawn between the servants on the Hoozoor and District establishments: what is advantageous for one ousht to be the same for the other. 7. On this point I would remark, that the Hoozoor establishments alluded to by me are the Karkoons employed in the offices, and under the immediate eye of the Collector and his Assistants, and my object in excepting them from the Rules is to prevent the frequent change in these offices, by the promotion to places in the Talookas of these men, which would be found to be productive of great inconvenience. The duties of a Hoozoor Karkoon or Sheristadar are peculiar, and qualifications for them cannot be acquired without practice, and natural aptitude. The art of reading aloud intelligibly and correctly, and quickness in understanding and writing an order, are accomplishments not readily attained, and a person unaccustomed to such duties, though of good abilities, would be for many months almost useless, whilst the constant reference to previous correspondence would for a very long time bewilder and impair the efficiency of a stranger. A man may be a good( 17 ) Shcristadar, and yet not at all fit to fill the higher offices in the districts ; and therefore the provisions of paragraph 11 of my letter appear necessary. I do not think that the Hoozoor establishments should be bound by the Rules, because, in the event of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Hooz^oor, ^he senior of the lower grade of emolument in the districts could claim it as a right, though his previous education and duties could not have prepared him for it. A very excellent Karkoon or Mahalkurry might be utterly unfit for the office of Sheristadar. Although I would not insist upon the observance of the Rule in the promo tion of Hoozoor establishments, I do not intend that they should be excluded from the benefits of it, anid any one of the Hoozoor establishment, who at his own wish or not may be changed to the districts, will of course come under the Rules the same as others. 8. In addition to the inconvenience which would arise by frequent changes, it must be remembered that the Hoozoor establishments only are under the immediate observa tion of the European Officer, and he has an opportunity of judging of their fitness for promotion or otherwise in that particular department. 9. The Collector of Rutnagherry thinks that the whole of the Collector's department should be regulated by Rules of seniority, and that the examinations candidates pass should fit them for any situation under Rs. 25. 10. I agree with the Collector in thinking that the whole of the Collector's establish ment should be regulated by these Rules, with the exception of the Hoozoor or Chitnees' establishment. I never intended to except the Duftur. I do not concur in the opinion that the examination of candidates for admission into the service can qualify men to hold any situation under Rs. 25. A Karkoon of Rs. 20 is first in a Mahalkurry's Cutcherry, and in the absence of the Mahalkurry occasionally must conduct his duties. A lad who is a candidate for admission is not examined in the Regulations, or book-keeping, or the mode of conducting business : reading and writing Canarese and Mahratta, and arithmetic up to a certain point, are the subjects of examination. A lad pronounced qualified in these respects is admitted into the service commencing at the lowest grade : by the time he has risen to the rank of Rs. 18, he ought to have qualified himself in the Regulations, keeping accounts, and mode of transacting business generally, for a higher appointment. This he will have done if he has been moderately attentive and diligent, and not wanting in ability. There are many men who are neither attentive nor diligent, and who are want ing in ability. It is to bar the progress of such men that the examination of servants when they arrive at the 18 rupee grade should take place. A man who knows nothing of the Regulations, or mode of keeping accounts, is certainly not fit to conduct the duties of Mahalkurry ; and therefore, to discover whether a man is in these respects fit to be First Karkoon in a Mahalkurry's Cutcherry, I propose the examination of men who attain the grade of Rs. 18, and I do not see how their qualifications are to be determined without. 11. I have thus answered the remarks forwarded for my report; and in conclusion, I would observe that'the Rules were proposed to be introduced into this Collectorate only, and as an experiment, and are, as I think, and as Captain Wingate concurs in thinking, suited to meet the occasions of this Collectorate. The immediate general adoption of them was never contemplated. As far as I can gather from the tenor of the remarks of the Collectors, for whose opinions these Rules were circulated, their reception has not been very favourable. The local authorities may be supposed to be the best judges of what is required in their respective districts, and I trust my proposal for this Collectorate will not be rejected because it has not been approved of by the authorities of other( 18 ) Collectorates. I venture to hope that you will support my application fbr the introduction of these Rules into this establishment as an experiment, to be persisted in or relinquished as the result of its working may show it to be good or bad.

There are so many considerations besides the qualifications of Karkoons, which can be ascertained by an 'examination, (such as their character for diligence, zeal, integ rity, &amp;c.) which are involved in the selection to fill the higher situations, that I appre hend the plan you propose could not be followed generally. At the same time, I quite agree with you that it is very important that we should have some means of judging of the qualifications and character of the subordinate servants in our District Cutcherries.

As regards the opinion of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, I have been desired to state that it is strongly in favour of the plan of promoting by seniority when the parties are qualified for the offices vacant; and it appears to him that under the present system, considering the frequent changes among the European Revenue Officers, there must be great difficulty in preventing meritorious persons being super seded by others, and he rejects as incorrect Mr. Inverarity's opinion that ' the interven tion of Native friends is not ever thought of' by applicants for promotion when the Collector is accessible. 3. At the same time. His Lordship in Council considers that Mr. Goldfinch's scheme of promotion, however promising, would not be successful unless carried into effect by one satisfied as to it* merits, and he would not, therefore, insist on its being carried out in any Collectorate, but would leave it optional with any one who now or at any future time may wish to give it a trial, to do so. 4. I have been instructed to take this opportunity to direct you strongly to impress on the Collectors the desirableness of their preventing the good effects of dismissions where necessary being lost by the vacancy being filled up by expectants who have followed the European Officer from other parts of the country in which he has been previously employed. /( 20 ) 5.

It is doubtless true, as urged by Mr. Goldfinch, that old and meritorious servants are frequently to be found drawing small salaries, and employed in subordinate positions, while those whose claims are inferior, on the score of age, and, perhaps, also of ability, have gained promotion through the medium of personal interest. That persons of greater seniority, but inferior ability, should have been passed over, is not inconsistent with the public advantage ; but that both the claims of seniority and merit should have been set aside through the medium of personal interest is contrary to every sound principle on which the public service ought to be conducted. 31. Whilst we are ready to allow every due weight to the claims of long service, we should regard it as highly detrimental to the public interests if seniority of service were allowed to weigh against superiority in the varied qualifications required by a good revenue officer. Letter dated \bth January (No. 16) 1852, Paras. 12 and 13. Kules proposed by Mr. Goldfinch for the promotion of Native Revenue Servants. The Revenue Commissioner was informed that the opinion of Government is strongly in favour of the plan of promoting by seniority when parties are qualified for the offices vacant; and that it appears to them, that under the present system, considering the frequent changes among the European Revenue Officers, there must be great difficulty in preventing meritorious persons being superseded by others. He was also told that Government consider Mr. Gold finch's scheme of promotion, however pro mising, would not be successful unless carried into effect by one satisfied as to its merits, and would not therefore insist on its being carried out in any Collectorate, but would leave it optional with any one who now or at any further time may wish to give it a trial, to do so. The Commissioner( 21 ) was requested strongly to impress on the 32. We could have desired your orders on the Collectors the desirableness of their prevent- question to have been more definite. We very much ing the good effect of dismissions wheref 11,1,1 ^.i r • ^ ^ • x ^1. , . 1 t 1 ^ , • doubt whether the practice of introducing to the necessary being lost by the vacancy being r 0 filled up by expectants who have followed higher grades of office Natives who have followed the the European Officer from other parts of European Officer from other parts of the country is the country in which he ha3 been pre- not jj ,. to ^ to otion from feeli of viously employed. ^ 1 0 regard for an attached follower, rather than from the comparative merits of the individual, whilst the advantage of local knowledge, which the European necessarily wants, cannot in this case be possessed even by the Native; and we are of opinion, whilst we would not actually prohibit such a course, that it ought to be generally discouraged. 33. It appears to us that your order leaves the question of promotion in exactly the same position as before, since it must always have been optional with the Collector to recommend individuals for promotion on the ground either of seniority or merit. 34. Our decided opinion is that merit and superior fitness for the situation to which the individual is to be appointed ought to be the ground of promotion. Length of service is, of course, an essential element in the claims of any individual, and ought to decide the preference in the case of equal fitness. We therefore desire that your Government should devise a plan by which the head of each office might place on private record, for his own guidance, but more especially for the use of his successor, his opinion of the character and qualification of his principal Native officers.
