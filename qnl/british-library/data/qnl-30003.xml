In 1940 the oil shipments on which are calculated the royalty payments made by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to the Persian Government were at a low level. So were the British fortunes of war; and these two factors compelled the Company to submit to the demands and threats of Reza Shah and to conclude an agreement under which their total payments to the Persian Government for the three years 1939-1941 would be made up to £4,000,000 a year (P.Z.4715/40). If H.M.G. had been in a better bargaining position the Company might have got off on a plea of force majeure. When the Persians raised the question of the renewal of this agreement, the Company took the view that a continuance of the 'make-up' payments might be valuable in securing the goodwill of the Persians, especially in the post-war period. The Foreign Office and Sir R. Bullard on the other hand argued that Persian &gt; goodwill, both now and after the war, will depend not upon the douceurs offered them, but upon the strength of the British position in the Middle East. It was finally decided, however, that H.M.G. could raise no objection if the Company persisted in their attitude;and the Company have recently agreed to continue their payments at the same level from the beginning of 1942 until the end of the war in Europe. There are two considerations which suggest that — the Company*s decision may not after all be unfortunate:- Wt 29166/P 207 1600 __ 11.37 ‘ / wr~ (a) The Conrpany^ takings under the concession are said to be rising, so that before the war in Europe is over, the annual sum due to the Persian Government under the concession may total more than 000,000. Hence the agreement should not impose an undue burden on the Company. (b) When the matter was first considered in February last, it was pointed out that the Persians already 'had more sterling than they knew what to do with; so that further payments in sterling would be no real gain to them. xhe view now taken is that the only way to stave off the financial crisis which threatens Persia is to supply her with more money - in any currency which will provide backing for her note issue - in spite of the risks of inflation jwhich this involves. In fact the Persian Government have just asked for and obtained from the Company an advance on the 1943-19A4 royalties in order to keep their head above water. Financial Secretary to see. oc 1 \ i Xe . vii. 4 3 _ ra ■' ^ Seen, thanks. I am rather doubtful whether this really serves a useful monetary purpose. It is true that there is a considerable degree of inflation in Persia and further exacerbation of the condition is probably inevitable as we and our Allies have to pour out money in connection with military needs. Such additions to the circulation may well require to be backed by sterling or some other acceptable form of backing; but the amounts of sterling involved in the 'make-up” payments are presumably held freely in the hands of the Persian authorities,enabling them to pour out further currency on their own account (which they dphot have the trouble of raising by taxation or borrowing and thus exerting a counter-inflationary effect) in addition to the unavoidable outpouring by us for our military needs. 22.vii.1943. .WNl'* 1 S'/Jr- * * &amp; St Si r V _ 1 j&gt; ~ZT V -trroi r I have the honour to refer to your tel a ,^raai No# 472; dated 18th May 1942 in which you informed me of the decision of the Angelo ■‘Iranian Oil Company to continue the M lfla^ce-up T, payment until the *»nd of the war in Turope# :rooT'-t-iv aer esr* t r*^thi ^ tel efiram an the announcement but it came obviously from one of the Persian Govern lent Departments.

Noury Esfandiary, Oil Delegate of the Persian Government in London.—(Received in Foreign Office the 2%th May) ( 1 ) Sir W. Fraser to M. F. Noury Esfandiary. Dear Excellency, 2Mh May, 1943. MY colleagues and I have given the most careful thought to your letter of the 31st December, 1942, informing me of the instructions received by you from the Imperial Persian Government. The company agreed in the early part of the present war to make extra payments over the sums due under the terms of the concession, without any prejudice whatever to the articles thereof, the company having always carried out faithfully all its concessional obligations. This was done solely with a view to giving assistance to the Imperial Government in the exceptional circumstances created by the war in Europe and the arrangement included a stipulation that its duration should be limited to the period up to the end of 1941 and that payments made were outwith the concession and would not affect its terms or create a precedent. My company also undertook to confer with a view to reaching an arrangement agreeable to both parties in regard to the period after 1941, and is, moreover, most anxious to foster the spirit of goodwill towards Persia, where we have worked for so many years and will work for many years to come under the concession agreement of 1933. Therefore, as an arrangement quite apart from the concession, I am glad to be able to inform your Excellency that the Board has authorised me to agree that with effect from the 1st January, 1942, the company will make up the sums due on account of royalty tonnage, dividend participation, taxation and'gold premium to Four Million Pounds Sterling (£4,000,000) in total in respect of each year ending the 31st December in which the aggregate sum payable under articles 10 and 11 of the concession should not reach this figure, up to and including the year in which hostilities between the United Kingdom and both Germany and Italy cease as a result of the conclusion of a general armistice; or, if armistices are concluded with those Powers separately, the year in which the later armistice is concluded. Thereafter all payments to be made by the company shall be regulated by the terms of the concession. Yours sincerely w. frAser. ( 2 ) M. F. Noury Esfandiary to Sir W. Fraser.

All the modifications you suggest in connection with paragraph 4 have been given effect to in my final letter to the Delegate, of which I enclose a copy. I also enclose a copy of his reply. You will notice that there are one or two other alterations in that part of the letter which deals solely with the Company’s viewpoint towards this question, which have been effected as the result of further talks with the Iranian Minister and Delegate. I.have noted with regret that H.M.G. are not prepared to meet any part of the additional charge falling on the Company as the result of this arrangement The arrangement was originally entered into at the request of H.M.G. when it was agreed that H.M.G. and my Company would each bear 50/ of the cost. It is therefore felt that this basis should have continued until the arrangement was finally concluded. Whilst, in respect of the year 1942, these make-up payments may not be a serious hardship, it is our intention to re-open the subject if, owing to circumstances beyond the Company’s control connected with the war, conditions should change to an extent that the burden on the Company should become excessive.

Barstow and Mr. Pack - were thit the Treasury would not agree to assume liability for one half of any further ’’blackmail' payments which the Company might v/ish to make; (b) that in the Treasury view the undertaking about 'arrangements satisfactory to both parties' did not constitute any commitment so far as the Treasury was concerned for continued financial payments outside the Concession: and that if Treasury agreed to such payments it would be on the score that they did not feel entitled to press the Company unduly on the question of their commercial interests. Following on this conversation Sir W. Fraser came to see me and left me the attached draft letters which the Company now wish to exchange, not apparently with the Persian Minister, but with the Persian Delegate to the Company. He received what I told him about the Treasury’s rejection of any financial commitment with some surprise, said that the Government Directors had not made this clear so far, but gave it as his opinion that, while the Comoany would not forego what they imagined to be their claim on Treasury participation, they would not hesitate to conclude their arrangement with the Persians without any assurance of such participation. Sir W. Fraser went on to say that his Board had felt it impossible to raise the matter of the cancellation of the unfounded charges brought against the Company under the ex-Shah’s regime and even added that in this respect they were proposing to take my advice. I did not fail to point out that v/hat I had said was that the withdrawal of these charges did not seem to me to represent an advantage which could be held to justify submitting to the 'blackmail' payments. It was quite a different thing for the Company to say that they intended to submit to these payments but agreed that it was not worth while to get the charges withdrawn. On the whole question Sir W. Fraser argued once more (and he mentioned that the two Government Directors had made reservations to allow their consulting the Government Departments concerned and were not as yet to be understood as endorsing the draft letters) that the essential thing was to secure the future goodwill of the Persians and that this could not be done if no offer were made in the fulfilment of the undertaking about a 'satisfactory' agreement. He repeated once more that the Company did not wish to secure any modification of the Concession in return for the suggested payments since 'they felt both that no modification was required and that it would be dangerous to do anything which might call the Concession itself into question. Mr. Gass, their local representative, had concurred/r \\ concurred in this view: he, however, wished the Company to make some offer to the Persians of financial support for the improvement of provincial administration or police or some similar object: the Company felt that to start this kind of thing might expose them to a repetition of similar demands in the future (this seems an odd kind of argument for the Company to produce) and that it was preferable to do what they proposed, i.e. to go on making extra payments for the duration of the war (a phrase for which the Company would welcome a Foreign Office interpretation) and entirely clear from the Concession itself. Sir W. Fraser said the Company would like to have our blessing on their proposals, to which I replied that I could hardly think that he would have that, but at the very most a reluctant concurrence in the Company doing what it thought best in its own commercial interests. I would, however, as he requested, lay the matter before the Secretary of State. We had better now (a) send copies of these drafts to the Treasury, Mines Department, and anyone else concerned, saying that we are laying the matter before the Secretary of State, (b) stir up Sir R. Bullard for a reply, and (c) draft a memorandum putting the position as concisely as possible for submission to the Secretary of State. Sir W. Fraser insisted that he had made oulL 4 points to his co-directors and that their attitude was nevertheless unchanged.

February 24th, 1943. •oOo- Your telegram No. 125, I think it is desirable firstly to decide whether (a) these negotiations are to be left to take place between the company without overt diplomatic, support on the one hand, and the Persian Government on the other, or whether (b)..in view of the Imperial importance of southern oil, negotiations •• ought to be conducted at Government level from the outset. I strongly recommend the latter because any apparent failure on the part of His Majesty’s Government or this Legation to manifest a lively concern for this vital British interest is likely to be construed as a confession of a form of weakness in our general Empire position in Persia both now and after the war, or as a‘ tacit recognition of the justice of the Persian case, or both. These considerations will affect the Americans and Russians appreciation of the situation as well as Persian. The conversations are obviously necessary and I feel that' they should take place in London rather than in Tehran. ' ’ ■ /: 2 . I am in agreement with the views expressed in paragraph 3 of your telegram under reference. I assume your argument at 3 (5) would be'used in the sense of my paragraphs (c; and (h) below, for Persians will always be ready to accept *more (repeat more)* of something for nothing, even unspendable sterling. The Company will acquire neither merit nor goodwill from the present or any other Persian Government by a gesture such as they propose. Post war attitude of Persia will depend entirely on'our general political position at that time and will not be influenced by any magnanimity we may have displayed in the meantime. 3. I think we ought to adopt-the following line of argument with the Persian Government. (a) The 'blackmajT' agreement safeguarded the express terms of the concession. • -• \ * (b) It was negotiated at a time when, owing to the exceptional war situation, the immediate prospects seemed gloony of maintaining royalty tonnage, output at a level reasonably near previous ^experience*. This was borne out by the figures for June and July 1940, which were on the basis of 4 , 000,000 and 5 , 000,000 tons per annum respectively, against 9,455 million tons for 1937 the peak year. (c)- 2 - (c) In 1940 Persia v/as still short of foreign — exchange to finance the Shah's armament and construction programme. •• (d) If there was a case at all for special financial assistance it could only have been founded on those grounds, although the manner in which it was extracted and the amount of *it savoured of;extortion*. (e) It is true that 1940 agreement provides for a review of the position as from the end of 1941, hut in the light of circumstances prevailing at the time. (f) . Special circumstances of 1940 and 1941 have disappeared. (g) Royalty tonnage for 1942 was 8*4 million which is not far short of the peak year and is the fourth highest in the history of the concession. There is no reason to expect in future any reversion to the exceptional conditions of 1940 and 1941 which the agree ment was designed to meet. (h) Persia has now more foreign exchange than she can use for a long time to come. (i) The ‘’blackmail 11 agreement should therefore be forgotten and both parties should revert to terms of the concession, 4. The oil royalties issue is one of the questions that has been remitted to Millspaugh. I think it is desir able therefore that the presentation of our case should,on the one hand, be reasonable to Persia and on the other display no tendency towards admitting that the agreement of 1940 was justified to any greater extent than I have suggested in previous paragraph. 5. Finally, if it should be decided eventual! ly, ir it snouia oe aeciaea eventually • to do something by way of a make-up payment it should be done against a quid pro quo in the form of some extension in terms of the existing concession. 6 . I suggest that the Company should be informed at once that His Majesty's Government do not intend to contribute any part of a make-up payment. 7. I understand that Rice has already telegraphed his views to London.

Attack on Russia removes for the time beinp’ at any rate danger of Russian aggression on Afghanistan which ao always been main obsession of the Afghan Government. At e same time possibility of German trade with .Afghanistan is practicaliy excluded except through very long and uncertain th^ te -p V i la Ir + n an ? Turke y* These two factors should incline no Aghans towards closer co-operation with ourselves if we a y. °u r pa^ds v/ell though no Aoubt the desire to re-insure hG P° ssib I lit; y of a German victory will bo a powerful f^ f i Ucnce ^. on othG ' r si(ie an( I the .Afghans may well show a tendency to sit on the fence till they see more clearly how ^- la stands a P to the German attack. The cessation^of trade i Ge J many and thG impossibility of her supplying material ^ raison^Pt™ 5 !? 1 ?' 4 f ° r f '?y° ries et c- will mean that the _gi-.on d ctre of the majority of German nationals in .aghanistan will disappear and will afford us an opportunity to pross for their departure and in view of the economic stranglehold which we and Russia will now have on Afghan trade wc might vrell make it an essential condition of any further economic assistance which we give to her that action is taken y ce to cut dow n the number of Germans in the country. It omi fiy 00S ? ary in p hat cas0 that wo should bo prepared to experts of our own to take their place. The method of approach to the ..fghans on this subject will require careful consideration but the essential point no doubt Is to Russia^ mh? geStl y of exerting pressure in combination with wttv, ,, Thls . mi S h t well frighten the .Afghans into keeping in with the ..xis as re-insurance against what they might S ■ egard as a combined threat to their independence.

' I see no reason to dissent from your estimate of the situation and my conclusion is that immediate and energetic action on our part is necessary with a view to jolting Iranian authorities out of their apparent complacency and inducing them to take what measures they can, before it is too late, to check possible German intrigues. \7hat has recently happened in Iraq provides an excellent opportunity for drawing attention to the disastrous effect of German intrigues in that country, and we should ensure that everything possible is done in Iran so that all concerned shall draw the moral. 2 f You should consider urgently what action you can usefully take along these lines. I suggest that a press campaign or, if censorship makes this impossible, a whispering campaign, should be inspired, ascribing the disasters which have befallen Iraq to deliberate German attempts to create confusion by overthrowing the existing regime, driving out the Regent and the constitutional Government, and setting up instead a gang of political Generals and disgruntled politicians; this is the kind of thing which happens in every country where German infiltration has been allowed to proceed; such things must not be allowed to happen in Iran; nevertheless the country views with some dismay the fact that large numbers of German agents have been allowed to enter Iran; and so forth. 3% Our main objective, however, must presumably be to try to bring home to the Shah himself the dangers of the position. I think that you should seek an early interview with the Prime Minister and beg him most earnestly to draw His Majesty*s attention to the realities underlying the present situation, and to the serious potential dangers to his whole regime/r \ \ mm 2 . • ♦ regime. You could remind him of your previous warnings^ ^$-see your telegrajus Nos, 15, 21 and 53 [of Janu ary 7th, January 15th and February 11th] and suggest that events in Iraq have now provided clear evidence of 5th Column- activities unscrupulously instigated hy Germans against a legitimate Government* There is no reason v/hy even in Iran a serious attempt should not he made hy the Germans established there to organise a revolt in the hope of creating confusion oY of setting up a pro-German Government e Is is appreciated that the large number of Germans who have been allowed to enter Iran are alleged to be necessary in order to instal machinery which the Iranian Government have purchased in Germany; but surely the numbers of these so-called experts can and should be most drastically reduced, and surely in any case the need for countering any attempt-to stage a political crisis in Iran is far greater than the need for haste in installing German machinery. Would not therefore His Majesty be well-advised to order the • immediate withdrawal from Iran of all these German agents except possibly one or two who are knovm to be genuine ^ experts, and who could, be placed under strictest ' supervision?INDEXED S 2243/42/34. ^ IJLivjXlV 2 V KtfC, I —* cev . 7o-\ FILE COPIIhinmi orri s, compliment. ^ c^- i&gt;&gt;tary of State yV'Lu^h t di ate. io r Foreign Affair- Sir, M 2^ M'lO.* 1 34: J &lt;t.u « .t r p.z. 2656 A * I am .directed by Mr. secretary 15ddn'*tr5“'trdiiamit to you herewith, to be laid before the Air Council, a copy of a telegram from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran regarding certain alleged violations of Iranian territory by British aircraft engaged in escorting convoys. 2. Mr. Kden realises that since one bank of the Shatt-al-Arab lies in Iranian territory, it may not always be easy for aircraft to avoid occasional violations of a minor nature when escorting convoys up or down the river, but he nevertheless feels that, for the reasons set out by Sir Header Bullard, it is highly important that every effort should be made to avoid such flights over Iranian territory. Further, there would appear to be no reason why any ftoyal Air Fo ce machine should hove flown so far inland over Iran as Ahwaz. 3. I am accordingly to request that the truth of the allegations referred to may be investigated urgently, and to suggest th*t if they prove to be correct, a formal apology should be addressed to the Iranian Government. It would in any case appear desirable that instructions should be iesued to all the pilots concerned to exert the utmost care /to The Under-Secretary of State for Air, Air Ministry.2656 1941 I V— — &gt; Copy# 22kVk2/3k). t AMSHBBX) COPY.

Bullard thinks that the Germans (assuming that they fail to win the Shah over) might stage a coup d’etat and set up another Government in theii own interests. Pie evidently thinks that they might be successful in this owing to the unpopularity of the Shah. In that event if the. Shah appealed to us for protection we should be faced with a difficult problem - v/hether to support him (as the legitimate sovereign) or not. This question, if it arises, might, of course, depend^ on whether the opposition Government was completely/^ *»&gt; .vV 2 . completely under German domination andon whether any other possible • candidate was in view who might serve as a rallying point. As General Muspratt says in his note below the best means we have of preventing untoward events in Persia is a speedy liquidation of the Iraq rebellion and the maintenance of a strong force at Basra. /£cJ ' ^ J' \ % '' i 1 i !t.tot [Cypher] Sir R.

S'. ^»SO^vTU.\ \C5^ +t- j It is to he supposed that Germans will try to deprive us of Abadan oil. if they cannot do this by securing military command of right bank of Shatt el Arab they may try to set up a pro-German Government in Iran, (Persia) which would cancel our concession and interrupt our oil supplies at least for.a time. General discontent in Iran provides good field for intrigue. The Shah is object of almost universal execration and we also as his supposed supporters. He could not count upon full support by the army. Movement for the removal of the Shah and even of his dynasty would be popular. If Germans began or supported such a movement it would run counter to any support they may be giving in secret to the King of Egypt but that would hardly deter them. More important is Russia 1 s attitude. I cannot forecast that but I notice that Soviet Ambassador hitherto professing indifference shov/s interest in number of Germans in Iran. Population in general expect Russian occupation premeditated as counter weight if Germans penetrate into Arab countries but this is based on ancient fears not on present evidence. If the Shah was forced to leave his capital and failed to find Iranian support elsewhere it is conceivable he would retreat to the oil area especially if we had been forced by circumstances to embark upon its defence; or he might seek our protection elsewhere. In that case we should I think avoid any action which might be represented as supporting his cause and contemplating his return. As the 3hah keeps order and maintains neutrality his continuance in power during the war probably suits us better than any practicable alternative but if he were once driven out, even if obviously by German action, we ought to act with the greatest caution and above all to avoid any suggestion that we class him with popular rulers of Norway, Netherlands, etc. REG®.

No discussion was permitted though terms differ largely from those authorized (your telegram No. 106) and adds something like half a million pounds annually to payment of the demand. It is understood that the terms were dictated by the Shah who has always maintained that he is entitled to four million pounds a year and now seems determined to have it.

Bullard, (Tehran). 10th July, 1940 CONFIDENTIAL OOOOOOOOO But for publication of new German White Paper about bombing Baku etc., we might have been in a better position in Iran than we had for some time as the Shah had at last begun to take action against German influence. Isolated German reporter was not only discharged but was imprisoned with &lt; several members of his family, in particular brother who in Iran had been responsible for giving many unauthorized visas to Germans. When Berlin broadcasts in Persian made personal attacks on Shah Germany went too far. It seems that Germany disclaimed responsibility and lays the blame on the announcer who seems to have ceased to broadcast, but I learn that contracts granted to Germans are being scrutinized closely and that a number of Germans had been given notice to leave. Iranian Government have said nothing to me about the White Paper and I do not suppose that bombing of Baku by us would have distressed them if their name could have been kept out of the matter but in that the allegations in White Paper may perhaps induce Russia and Germany to act together in the near and Middle East, the advantage we stood to gain when the Germans became unpopular here may be lost.

Only concrete proposal was that the Government should demand either increased royalty at a fixed rate : regardless of the output, or else the abandonment by the Company of those fields which they cannot exploit to the full. 3* Prime Minister wound up the debate with further assurance of the Government's action, and a promise to keep Majlis informed.

He proposed tq send an officer to survey the area and asked the company to help. Pattinson naturally refused urging that the military attach^ should inspect the area. The General Officer Commanding who appeared to be ignorant of the existence of Legation or Consulates insisted that he must send an officer to work from the Ahwaz or Mohamrnerah Consulate, and would make arrangements through the political resident. I have heard nothing from the General Officer Commanding. (2) It is of course essential that such discussions should only take place after prior consultation with, and express approval from myself. Similarly any recommendations for action should be sent to me for consideration The suggested channel of communication through the- political resident is quite unsuitable.' V.%. | 1675 | , 1940 ' (3) As regards the proposal to send an officer, I need hardly emphasise that his arrival at Khuzistan on such a mission would have the most unfortunate effect. The Iranian Government are so suspicious that I would even deprecate sending the Military Attachd'to inspect the area. The Consul at Ahvaz has a confidential company map showing how flood effects the area, which he is sending to Bagdad to be copied. If this map does not give all information required by the General Officer Commanding, the Consul at Alwaz is fully competent to answer any questions or secure lurcher details from the company.

My Lord, Tehran, June 10, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 71 of the 4th June, I have the honour to send to your Lordship herewith further particulars about Lord Cadman s recent visit to Tehran. Lord Cadman arrived by air on Saturday, 27th May, and left also by air on Monday, 5th June. During his visit he had two conversa tions with the Shah each lasting about two hours, at which the Crown Prince, as well as M. Bader, the Minister of Finance, were present. 1 he Crown Prince helped substantially to allay a misgiving of Lord Cadman’s that the Shah would hear what the interpreter rather than he himself wished to tell him, for the Crown Prince began at an early stage to interrupt and amend M. Bader s translations and before the close had pretty well taken over the work of inter preter. Lord Cadman felt no reason to regret this substitution. 2. As I informed your Lordship in my telegram under reference. Lord Cadman was a good deal more than hopeful that an agreement had been reached on certain points that have been under protracted and inconclusive discussion between the company’s representatives here and the Iranian authorities, and further that the suspicions of an unwarranted policy of restricting output which had found violent expression in the inspired press had been demonstrated to he unfounded. 3. New Concession A rea. —At the beginning of the discussion it was clear that the Shah had been turning over in his mind the possibility that it would pay him better to reduce the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s area and to grant part of it to an independent concern. Lord Cadman showed that such a step could not have the effect of increasing the market for Iranian oil, and the idea, of a complete repudiation of the concession, which would be entailed by such a division of the area, was not pursued. Finally, agreement was reached on the new area to be allotted to the company for development under the terms of the concession as revised in 1933, by Lord Cadman agreeing to exclude all the Mekran coast, a section that the company had asked to have included in the 100.000 square miles to which they are entitled. Lord Cadman recognised that the company’s desire to include the whole southern and south-eastern coast of Iran had naturally created some suspicion; nor did he consider it essential that the whole coastal* area should he included. In return for the section omitted M. Bader had offered some other inland areas. 4. Port dues at Bandar Mashur. —Before committing itself whole-heartedly to the development of Bandar Mashur—few miles north of Bandar Shahpur in the Khor Musa—as the port to handle the output of the new field at Gach Saran, the company has attached great importance to securing some assurance which would guarantee it against being mulcted by the imposition of port dues in excess of what was reasonably required for the Iranian port services. Lord Cadman fully believes that he has been able to secure a satisfactory settlement of this question. „ 5. Outyut and Markets .—Lord £adm4n went into this matter very fully with His Imperial Majesty. He showed him. a chart indicating the rise of world output since 1933 and the company.’s^own output, which registered a steeper percentage rise; he explained that the company were debarred from markets in large parts of the world, including America and Russia, and he referred to stocks having been filled up by many countries in 1937. which had the double effect of making that a bumper yqar .for output and the following year a leaner one, quite apart from the restricting Yhftuence on trade of uncertainty in the international situation. ;l .. [630 y—2] * « -2 6. Lord Cadman took advantage of this opportunity to refer to the Iraq Petroleum Company; to the extent to which it still does not compete with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company; to his own position as chairman; and above all to the sums that that company is feeling able to advance to the Iraqi Government. The Shah seemed entirely to appreciate Lord Cadman’s explanations on these points, and I venture to record my own satisfaction that he has forestalled the last point reaching the Shah’s ears in some garbled form. 7. I did not refer in my telegram No. 71 to the other matter which Lord Cadman discussed with the Sliah, namely, that of providing financial resources for carrying out His Imperial Majesty’s present programme of developing his country. Railway, industrial and military plans are all making large demands, and it may be supposed that it was the fall in the royalties from the company in its bearing on these demands that provoked the obstruction and ill-will that the company has been encountering. Lord Cadman put it to His Imperial Majesty that to take more money from the company (or to pillory the company in the press) would seriously prejudice its position and consequently its ability to help him in his development plans, notably as regards Bandar Mashur for which the company must find some 15 million in the course of the next few years. Lord Cadman referred to the possibility, which I understand he had previously discussed with the Export Credits Guarantees Department, of facilitating Iranian imports by means of credits in London, and the Shah seemed to accept the suggestion that the possibilities in this direction might be further explored, perhaps by sending a special representative to London. 8. During his valuable visit of rather more than a week Lord Cadman took a keen and most enterprising interest in various manifestations in and around Tehran of the new industrialised Persia. I feel that my debt to him is by no means confined to the fullness with which he kept me posted as to his business conversations. Inter alia I think it is satisfactory that he should have established direct contact witJh the Crown Prince, and that on matters of serious concern to the future welfare of the country.

White-Allom and Company for the care and artis tic feeling displayed by them in its design and constructionBRITANNIC HOUSE The beautiful new home of the Anglo-Persian group of Oil Companies in Finsbury Circus, London, E.C.a. The building, which was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, R.A., is a fine instance of the adaptation of Renaissance architecture to modern commercial requirements.A RETROSPECT ( ■ ' AND SURVEY , xa great exhibition devoted to the achievements of the British Empire in every branch of art, science, and industry, it is natural and inevitable that oil should occupy a conspicuous place. The oil industry is the newest and already one of the most vital of the great industries. For the British Empire, scattered about all the seven seas, it has a special importance. The strength and union of the Empire are based largely on naval and air supremacy, and this supremacy to-day is based on oil. That was one of the most impressive and insistent lessons of the Great War. More over, oil has now become the greatest essential of industrial existence, and the country which lacks it, or which is unable to ensure independent supplies of it commensurate with its industrial requirements, muSt always be at a great disadvantage as compared with countries more fortunately situated. Perceval Landon, writing of the Persian oil fields in a great London daily newspaper nearly ten years ago, said : “ The ever-running black fluid that finds its way in the dark one hundred and forty-five miles from the Field of Oil to the island of Abadan on the Shatt-el-Arab may one day prove to be the very life-blood of our existence.” I his at the time may have seemed to many of its readers a rhetorical ex . a &amp;g erat i° n &gt; b ut t ^ ie events of the intervening years have proclaimed v ith constantly increasing emphasis the vital national importance of adequate and secure supplies of oil. For this reason the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as the foremost all-British oil company, and on account of its intimate association with the British Government and also with the Government of Australia, occupies a very special position in the industry of the Empire. It seems, therefore, more than usually fitting, in connexion with this great British Imperial Exhibition, to give some account of the romantic beginnings and remarkable development of this Company. * * * * An endeavour has been made to express in the very chara&amp;er of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Stand at Wembley something of the extraordinary blend of EaSt and W eSt which the history of the Company presents. The building—it is depifted on the cover of this booklet- carries the mind back to the beauty and myStery and ancient splendour of I ersia. Such walls as these front the cloudless sun in Shiraz and Ispahan. In their shadow the black-robed caravanners halt from their journey and tell the interminable tales of the EaSt.HI ' ■ p i I ' -' } *-o?“:- JuSt such doorways, with gleaming tiles of blue and green, look out upon gardens whose roses inspired the songs of Hafiz and Omar. This distinctively Persian building has been chosen by the Company as a compliment to the country from which it draws the crude oil on which its prosperity is based. In thus obtaining from a foreign source its raw material, the Company is following a great British tradition, exemplified in the a&amp;ivities of many other companies whose manufadtures are also represented in this Empire Exhibition. It is a co-operation which for Persia as well as for England has already meant enormous benefits and holds the promise of Still greater rewards. Through the development of its wonderful resources of mineral oil, Persia has cast off much of its ancient lethargy and has joined in the march of modern progress. Oil-derricks now lift their heads among the hills whose only sign of human adlivity had been the nomadic tribesman or the ruined altars of the Fire-Worshippers. Across the silent plains which once resounded to the tramp of the men-at-arms and chariots of Alexander the Great,the pipe-lines carry the rich Stream of petroleum to a waiting world. By the shores of the Shatt-el-Arab rise the many buildings and tall chimneys of a vaSt modern refining town, and huge oil-tankers ride at anchor on its historic waters. The prime agent in this extraordinary transformation was an English man—William Knox D’Arcy—born at Newton Abbot, in Devonshire, in 1849, and educated at Westminster School. In 1866, when D’Arcy was seventeen years of age, his father, a solicitor, emigrated with his whole family to Queensland,where he established himself in the same profession Iin the town of Rockhampton, installing his son in his office to take up the Study of law. Here D’Arcy remained until by a lucky chance one of his clients showed him one day a lump of rock and asked him what it was. “ There’s a whole mountain of it back of my place,” he said. It was gold quartz. The man’s name was Sandy Morgan. That was the Start of the world-famous Mount Morgan gold-mine, and in a few years D’ Arcy and his original associates in the mine had become millionaires or multi-millionaires. MoSt men would have been satisfied with such a gift of fortune and been content to take their ease and enjoy the riches thus poured out for them. But D’Arcy was of the true pioneer type. He had the energy and imagination which demanded other frontiers to explore. Oil was juSt then looming up on the horizon as a rich new prize, a tremendous new force. With that intuition which some men call luck and other men call genius but which he himself would probably have described as mere ‘‘horse sense,” he realised its possibilities. He decided to go into oil. A chance meeting with a young Persian of the name of Kitabji possibly had something to do with D Arcy s decision to go to Persia, instead as one might have expefted, to his own Australia which he knew so well, kitabji told of oil seepages in the northern part of his country. Oil seepages, however, do not always indicate the existence of oil beneath the ground in commercial quantities, and already there had been efforts to dis cover oil with the drill in Persia—efforts which failed lamentably. The ersi.an Minmg Corporation, for instance—a Company formed under the auspices of the Imperial Bank of Persia, which had secured a concession lor the whole of the mining rights of Persia—had in the early ’nineties sunk two wells at Daliki, not far from Bushire, near a spring from the sur- ace o which the natives had been in the habit of skimming petroleum. The results were so meagre that the concession was abandoned. D Arcy, however, decided that the possibilities of Persian oil were well worth looking into. An experienced geologist, H. T. Burls, was sent to Persia. He examined two areas, one north of Baghdad, close to the Turco- Persian frontier, the other in the general direction of primitive local oil industry had been in existence for hundreds of years and was Still yielding oil&lt;[ ,1 On the strength of these reports, D’Arcy secured from the Shah in 1901 an exclusive concession for the exploitation of natural gas, petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite throughout the Persian Empire, except the five provinces along the Caspian Sea, which were regarded as coming under the Russian sphere of influence. The concession was for sixty years and covered 500,000 square miles of territory. Thus did William Knox D’Arcy enter upon the great task which was to occupy the remaining years of his life. It was a task for which his chara&amp;er and his early experiences in Australia had well prepared him. To no man of less daring and determination would success have been possible. And even his heroic optimism mu§t often have been near the breaking-point in those years of weariness and discouragement before the first great gusher at Maidan-i-Naftun gave assurance to him and his associates that the battle was won. * * * * The northern part of the concession was the first to be exploited. At Chiah Sourk, about one hundred miles north of Baghdad and the same distance from Kermanshah, operations were begun. In January and May, 1904, two producing wells were brought in, one of them flowing at the rate of two hundred barrels a day. The remoteness of the field, however— some six hundred miles from the Persian Gulf—made its proper develop ment both difficult and expensive. It was clear that oil muSt be found in larger quantities and in some more accessible diStrift if the venture was to be a success. In the meantime the expenses of operation in a country so difficult, so remote, so unsettled, and so undeveloped as Persia were mounting at an appalling rate. The First Exploitation Company, which had been formed to work the concession, was largely financed by D’Arcy himself. In one way and another he poured in those first few years more than £300,000 of his own money into the sands of Persia, and all he had to show for it by the end of 1904 were two very ordinary wells in a remote and comparatively inaccessible part of the country. That he did not give up was a measure of his courage and his confidence in the future of the Persian oil industry. It was at this Stage that he was approached by a German group with a proposal to relieve him of the Persian concession. ' Looking back in the light of the tremendous events which have since occurred, it is easy to see how largely political aimsh were mingled with this ostensibly commercial proposition. The proposal was no doubt partly due to the desire to assure to Germany the immense supplies of oil for which in a few years she was to have so vital a need. More essentially, however, it was a further Step in that conquest of the Middle EaSt which was intended as a prelude to greater conquests Still. The Hamburg-American Line, with the assistance of heavy sub sidies from the German Government, were making a bold bid to take the trade of the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia out of British hands. I he plan of the Berlin-to-Baghdad Railway—that “spear aimed at the heart of India ”—was already maturing. Persian oil was to have helped to furnish the driving force for that mighty weapon in the hands of predatory German imperialism. If D Arcy had gone into the oil business solely for the money that might be in it, he had here an opportunity to recoup himself handsomely for what he had spent. But he had other and higher aims. He was a patriot as well as a business man. He foresaw the great national value his concession might acquire in years to come, and he was resolved that it should remain in British hands. The oiler of the Germans was refused, and thus the first of many foreign attempts to get control of the Persian oil-fields was defeated. * * * * Even so early as 1904 the British Admiralty was seriously considering the possibility of converting the Royal Navy to oil-fuel, and a committee had been appointed, with the Right 'Hon. E. G. Pretyman as chairman, to look into the matter of supplies. On this committee sat Sir Boverton Redwood, who knew D’Arcy well and had a high opinion of ^ ^ ie i m p°ttance of the Persian field. Partly as a result of the intervention of this committee, the Burmah Oil Company and Lord Strathconawere induced to come to D’Arcy’s assistance 8qA general view of the famous oilfield of Maidan-i-Naftm {the Valley of Oil) il proposition.

Lord Strathcona had already rendered signal service to Empire development in Canada, and now in his extreme old age he agreed to lend his great name and experience to the furthering of another Empire projeft of even more moment than the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway for which he had been so largely responsible. In 1905 the Concession Syndicate, financed principally by the Burmah Oil Company, was formed at Glasgow to take over the further exploitation of the Persian concession. The first Step taken in the new policy of development was to transfer the scene of operations from Chiah Sourk to Marmatain, not far from Ahwaz on the Karun River. The region was comparatively easy of access, the terrain offered no particular difficulties, and drilling was soon begun. The wells at Chiah Sourk were capped, only such produftion being permitted as was necessary to feed a small refining plant for local uses. The results at Marmatain proved meagre and disappointing. It is now realised that drilling was not carried far enough to prove a real te§t. In the meantime, however, attention was drawn to a new area in the Baktiari Hills, about 145 miles from the Persian Gulf, ^Mention had already been made of this region in the reports of M. de Morgan, a French archseologiSt, who had spent many years in Persia in the neighbourhood of Shustar. He is said to have remarked to D’Arcy that if surface indications of oil went for anything, there was a spot on the track between Malamir and Shustar which might be worth his while looking into. Incidentally, it is a remarkable coincidence that two men of the name of Morgan should have played somewhat similar parts in both D’Arcy’s successes. The place referred to was a desolate valley named Maidan-i-Naftun (Valley of Oil), adjacent to a hill on which are the ruins of a huge temple erefled by the ZoroaStrians, known as Masjid-i-Suliman (Solomon’s Temple). There, by the side of a track well worn by the countless camels and mules which have trodden it from Biblical times, is a so-called “oilMules loaded with lengths of small pipe spring” at the side of a cliff. Before the advent of the Anglo-Persian Company, a small volume of oil had flowed from this spring—probably for many centuries—into a stream alongside, where it was held up by a few ancient dams, the oil being skimmed from the surface of the pool thus formed and taken away for sale or barter. It was used for burning purposes or for the healing of sores—both in man and beaSt. The bitumen which was deposited from the oil was used for the caulking of boats on the Rivers Tigris, Euphrates and Karun. There is no doubt that the oil was obtained from this source for the perpetual fires of the Temple in question— one of great fame in the time of the Sassanian Kings—and led to its ereftion at this particular spot.^/ It may be here mentioned that these oil springs are of common occurrence throughout the va$t range of mountains and hills extending from the Caucasus on theNorth-WeSt of Persia to the Indian frontier on the South- EaSt, and there is little doubt that this supply of liquid fuel and the supposed divine influences of fire had a good deal to do with the origin and spread for many centuries of the ZoroaStrian religion—the home of which lay chiefly in the line of this great oil belt. In any case the name of Maidan- i-Naftun which was given to this valley by the ZoroaStrians has proved prophetic, for in a few years that desolate spot in the Baktiari Mountains— almost depopulated since the downfall of the Sassanian Dynasty—has become a busy hive of industry and famous all the world over as one of the most prolific, if not the most prolific, of the oil fields yet discovered. This connexion between these subterranean sources of supply of mineral oil and the foundation of the ZoroaStrian religion is one of the moSt extraordinary incidents in the history of the religions of the world. * * * * The task of moving the drilling equipment to Maidan-i-Naftun was a moSt arduous one. Looking back to-day from the present high State of development of the Persian Oil Fields, with a railway, good roads, fleets of motor-cars, a fine hospital with a large Staff of doflors and nurses, comfort able dwelling-houses and clubs, workshops, wireless telegraphy, telephones, and eleflric light and power, it is difficult to appreciate what the pioneers had to endure. The country was mountainous and exceedingly difficult.11 One of the fleet of caterpillar-tractors Roads were non-existent or mere tracks so Steep and narrow that even the mules could hardly negotiate them under loads. And nothing can make oil drilling equipment either light or readily portable. Add to this the Strain of a climate which in summer converts every valley into a furnace and in winter fills the passes with snow or with floods of rain. The inhabitants were wild nomads. Few of them had ever seen a European before and none of them was accustomed to any but the most casual labour. Their predatory inStin&amp;s were aroused by the Company’s advent. Although the Persian Government were under obligation to give any necessary prote&amp;ion, no assistance at that time could be hoped for from Tehran and little from the local chiefs, whose hold over their own tribesmen was none too Strong. The Company’s Staff was small—a dozen Englishmen and half as many Canadian drillers. They were constantly subje&amp;ed to petty annoyances and even to the danger of physical violence. Still the work went on. Piece by piece the derricks were assembled and raised. For the first time the jar and thud of the plunging bit were heard in these wild hills. Slowly the well made its way down towards the oil-rock. In the meantime at the headquarters of the Syndicate in Glasgow there was anxiety and doubt. In May 1908 the fresh capital provided by the Concession Syndicate had been almost exhausted. Even D’Arcy’s robust optimism was affeffed by the constant deferment of the realisation of his hopes. There seemed to be every justification for those who felt that the scheme was doomed to failure and that to spend more money in the search for oil in Persia was merely to pour out water on the face of the desert. It was the darkest hour which comes juSt before the dawn. Orders had afhially been sent out from London that work was to be discontinued and the rigs dismantled when, on May 26, 1908, the drill plunged through to the oil-rock and the black Stream shot high in the air, carrying with it the tools, wrecking the derrick, and drenching the drillers, who were nearly suffocated by the enormous pressure of gas which accompanied it. They had brought in a “ gusher.” It meant viflory, the answer to discouragement and doubt, the con firmation of every hope that had been formed by D’Arcy and his associates. A few weeks before they had been faced with the loss of everything they had12 Drilling at ^larmatain SSiy for their perseverance and foresight. * * * * Juft a year later, in 1909, the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany was formed with a capital of ^2,000,000, which was increased by further issues of debentures and preference shares in 1910 and 1912 to ^,2,9005000. Lord Strathcona was the firft iAK v: Chairman. The productivity of Maidan-i-Naftun was amply proved . —&gt;- by the prolific well ftruck in 1908. Thereafter, developments were extended to the adjacent field of Maidan-i-Naftek, where again an enormously abundant yield was obtained at a depth of i l ,875 feet. With the assurance of the oil supply thus made complete, the great work of preparation for its transportation and treat ment went on as rapidly as the difficult nature of the country and the various obftacles which meet commercial development in a remote and primitive land would permit. Launches and barges and, later, ftern-wheel, shallow-draught Steamers were placed on the lower and upper reaches of the Karun River. A short railway was laid to overcome the obstacle of the rapids at Ahwaz and an up river terminus conftructed at Der-i-Khazineh. For the remaining thirty miles to the oil-field a road was blafted and built up the valley of the Tembi River, where before there had been only a mule-track, along which the Stream had to be crossed and recrossed thirty times. To-day a completely equipped railway conneds Der-i-Khazineh with the Fields. The coaStal plain of southern Persia runs back for a hundred miles or more from the sea, and here the task of laying the pipe-line was simple enough except in the rainy season. But from this comparatively narrow shelf of land the hills rise abruptly, leading up and up to the central Persian plateau. To reach the Fields, two ranges had to be crossed with the pipe-line, which at one point attains an elevation of 1,300 feet. A mule-track, wide enough for two mules to walk abreaft, was blaftedCrossing the Tembi T^iyer through the mountains. Over it mules from Ispahan climbed with lengths of pipe slung between them, four mules to each se&amp;ion, which weighed 820 pounds. The task of getting each into position and screwing it firmly into place in the ever-lengthening line continually called for engineering skill and daring of the highest order. In this way some 1,500 tons of pipe were carried and laid. Oil will not climb a hill. It mu$t be driven. This necessitated the conftru&amp;ion of a powerful pumping station on the River Tembi to force it over the two ranges of hills referred to, and the establishment of other pump-houses—“ boosting Stations ”—along the line, to keep it moving at the greatest possible speed. While this terrific task was being accomplished, the site chosen for the Company’s first refinery on the island of Abadan was a scene of no less Strenuous effort. Work was hurried on at this refinery—designed to include latest improvements—to prepare for the flood of oil to come. Jetties were built, tank-farms laid out for the Storage of the crude oil and the refined produ6fs to be made from it, a workshop conStru&amp;ed capable of carrying out mechanical and engineering work of every kind, a dry dock for repairing vessels, bungalows and administrative offices, a club, quarters for an enormous number of native employees, a large up-to-date hospital fitted with an X-ray operating theatre, a wireless Station, telephone and electric lighting services—all the countless and various tasks accomplished which are associated with the establishment of a complete refining and shipping installation on a large scale in a country entirely devoid of the ordinary facilities. The unusually long and wet winter of 1910-n in Persia seriously hampered these operations. There were Strikes in England which delayed essential deliveries, already slow and expensive on account of the great\ r alves on the Pipe-line from Maidan-i-Naftun to Abadan The famous Well, Fy , which has given over 5,000,000 tons \of oil distances all plant and material had to be brought. New refinery problems presented themselves for solution, and only experience with Persian oil could discover the beSt methods for its treatment. There were also the special demands of particular markets to be met. All this necessitated changes and additions which again meant delay. Furthermore, there were serious problems of health, especially among the white Staff, many of whom were not accustomed to tropical conditions. In spite of all these various difficulties, work was carried Steadily on, and by August 1912 a trial run of a portion of the refinery was carried through, and the other seftions gradually brought into operation. In O&amp;ober the first delivery of refined produ&amp;s was made to local markets, and the capacity of the refinery reached 6,000,000 gallons a month. * * * * The task of constructing and bringing into operation a complete oil- producing and refining system on so large a scale soon exhausted the amount of capital that had been provided. It became clear in 1913 that further capital would be required before the programme embarked upon could be completed and the Company brought to a dividend-paying position. At this Stage it would have been impracticable to raise further capital in the open market except on very onerous terms, partly because the oil industry at the time was passing through one of its many phases of poor returns, and partly because the Company was only juSt getting to the Stage of development necessary for the earning of dividends. It was therefore decided to seek the necessary financial assistance 14A “ Boofiing Station ” at Mullasani Carrying sections of Pipe line across the desert. 2 Jpe main Power and ^bmping Installation at Tembi Jl ILl © \ r alves on the Pipe-line from Maidan-i- N aftun to Abadan ^ht.

Ever since 1904 the Admiralty had been seriously considering the conversion of the Navy to oil-fuel, and in 1912 the oft-mooted question was brought to a head by the appointment by Mr. WinSton Churchill,' then First Lord of the Admiralty, of a Royal Com mission, under the Presidency of Lord Fisher, to advise the Government on the question of oil supplies. The evidence given before the Commission led to the conclusion that there would be no great risk in the conversion, assuming the availability of all the oil 'that would be required, and that, in any case, it was a risk that muSt be taken. Lord Fisher was particularly impressed by the evidence given by Sir Charles Greenway—then Managing Director of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company—as to the great potentialities of the Persian fields. From that time onwards the Government has attached the very greatest importance to these fields as one of the main future sources of supply for the British Navy. The position of the finances of the Anglo-Persian Company was then referred to the Government and a request made for assistance. Mr. WinSton Churchill, with his usual grasp of big questions, readily recognised the 1516 A panorama of the great Refinery at Abadan as seen from the J urgency of the situation and the necessity of keeping the fields in British hands. He gave favourable consideration to the proposals put forward, but before committing the Government to any a&amp;ion despatched a commission, headed by Admiral Slade, with Professor Sir John Cadman and Dr. Pascoe, now director of the Geological Survey of India, as experts, to verify the statements that had been made regarding the richness of the Persian fields. The report of the Commission being fully confirmatory of the representations that had been made as to the potentialities of the fields, the door was opened for the financial arrangement, completed on August to, 1914, which has since been of such enormous advantage to the Govern ment, as explained by Mr. Churchill in his book “ The World’s Crisis.” This arrangement not only assured large supplies of fuel-oil for the Navy at a moderate price, thereby creating competition in a market which had previously been very limited, but resulted in enormous profits to the Government as shareholders in the Company. Mr. Churchill in his book estimates the amount thus gained and saved, and does not hesitate to put it at £40,000,000. In this he includes the market value of the Government’s five million shares, which he puts at £16,000,000; the dividends and various taxes received, £'6,500,000 ; the savings e £ io,ooo,&lt; Whil severe k succeede next sev Compan; sole Mar In ic and so s and pow ments w knowing keystone Und&lt; War, w( capacity to meet made fo Nate ance oi was not Powers.J •»L - * A panorama of the great Refinery at Abadan as seen from the River. of keeping the fields in ition to the proposals put nt to any a&amp;ion despatched Professor Sir John Cadman Survey of India, as experts, regarding the richness of ion being fully confirmatory be potentialities of the fields, at, completed on August 10, ; advantage to the Govern- &gt;ok “ The World’s Crisis.” &gt;lies of fuel-oil for the Navy bon in a market which had l enormous profits to the Hint thus gained and saved, a.

While these negotiations were in progress, the Company suffered a severe loss in the death of their Chairman, Lord Strathcona. He was succeeded in the Chairmanship by Sir Charles Greenway, who for the next seven years, embracing the whole period of the War and of the Company’s great development, combined the duties of Chairman and sole Managing Dire&amp;or. In 1917 occurred the death of the great pioneer who so courageously and so successfully laid the foundations of the Company’s future wealth and power. William Knox D’Arcy did not live to see the immense develop ments which have since occurred, but he had the supreme satisfaction of knowing that the work he did and the sacrifices he made had become a keystone in the arch of national security and progress. ' Under the Stimulus of the national emergency brought about by the War, work was pressed forward with all possible speed in Persia. The capacity of Abadan Refinery was doubled. Further pipe-line was laid down to meet the increased requirement of crude oil. Arrangements were made for the conStru&amp;ion of a number of tankers. Naturally the import ance of these operations was not loSt on the Enemy Powers. One of the first— 18 An oil-loading jetty at Abadan a&amp;s of the Turks on the declaration of war was to endeavour to lay mines at the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab, so as to make access to Abadan impossible by sea. The fortunate and unexpe&amp;ed arrival of the Indian Expeditionary Force, which fought its first a&amp;ion at Sahil, almost opposite Abadan, prevented the carrying out of this design, and also a proje&amp;ed shell ing of the Refinery. Incidentally, it is significant that the mines were sent across by land from Constantinople some months before the outbreak of war. The next Step was the invasion of Persia from Amara by way of Hawaizah,with the objeft of cutting the pipe-line. The enemy approached within Striking distance of Ahwaz, but were unable to dislodge the small British Force holding the right bank of the Karun River. Their emissaries, however, were successful in persuading some of the tribesmen to co operate by cutting the pipe-line above Ahwaz. After the battle of Shaiba, however, the Turks withdrew, closely pursued by the 12th Division under General Gorringe. Order was quickly restored in Southern Persia and the Company was free to carry on its operations, which had now become of vital national importance. All the Turks had succeeded in doing was to hold up work for about four months and cause the loss of 144,000 tons of oil, representing over -('400,000. No further trouble was experienced. * * * * Since that time the record of the Company’s operations has been one of continuous and rapid expansion. All through the War years every nerve was Strained to meet the enormous needs of the Mesopotamian Chief administration building at Mohammerah— A Street in the bazaar at Abadan 19 Expeditionary Forces for petrol, kerosene, and fuel-oil, and the ever-increasing demands of the Admiralty. This necessitated constant additions to the Company’s plant—additions made exceedingly arduous by the inevitable reStri&amp;ions and difficulties of the period. VaSt quan tities of material were required. English foundries and fattories were already overwhelmed with war orders. Besides, it was almost impossible to obtain freights for the long voyage to Persia. There was the further difficulty of recruiting the extra European Staff made necessary by these developments. In spite of these numerous and serious obstacles, the work of expansion went rapidly on. And produ&amp;ion easily kept pace with it. It was a remarkable and happy coincidence that one of the wells, known as Fy, should in the spring of 1914 have burst into sudden and tremendous a&amp;ivity. This well was sunk in August 1911, and throttled down to give only 1,000 barrels a day. Suddenly, in March 1914, it “ drilled itself in,” with a produ£!ion of approximately 12,500 barrels a day—in the neighbour hood of 750,000 tons per annum. More remarkable Still is the fad that the produdion of this marvellous well has never failed, and it is to-day giving this enormous quota of oil with undiminished flow, making a total produdion to date of over 5,000,000 tons—fourteen hundred million gallons ! It is one of the wonders of the oil world, and there are to-day in the Persian fields other wells giving, or capable of giving, an even greater annual produdion. Cjroup of workers leaving the Kefinerjt m§ f The “ British Hussar/’ a typical Anglo-Persian Oil Tanker C Under these circumstances it is easy to understand how the figures for the Persian output of crude oil have shown a Steady and remark able annual increase. From 233,962 tons in the year 1913-14, they have gone to 1,106,415 tons in the year 1918-19, to 2,913,908 tons in the year 1922-23, whilst the produ&amp;ion for the year 1923-24 was 3,714,109 tons, and for 1924-25 it is anticipated that it will reach 4,500,000 to 5,000,000 tons. With this the development and expansion of plant have naturally had to keep pace. Maidan-i-Naftun, once a desolate and barren valley, has become a busy and popu lous oil centre. From it there Stretches not the original 6-inch pipe-line, but a system of two 10-inch pipe-lines, with a third of 12-inch diameter nearing O completion, and several “ boosting Stations.” At Abadan Stands one of the world’s A progress tell at Llandarcy Refinery A 1 /anker discharging at Swanseaersian Oil Tanker ir^tand how the figures for n a Steady and remark- n the year 1913-14, they 118-19, to 2 j9 i 359°8 tons for the year 1923-24 was that it will reach 4,500,000 &gt;f plant have naturally had ate and barren valley, has &gt;ecome a busy and popu- ous oil centre.

The Company now employs in Persia over 700 Europeans, nearly 5,000 Indians, and about 30,000 Persian subjects. * * * * Even more significant of the Company’s progress are the develop ments which have taken place not in Persia, but in Great Britain and in many other countries. It is these developments which have made the Anglo-Persian Oil Company not a mere local producing Company, however rich and powerful, but a world-wide organisation competing on equal terms with any similar organisation. They have meant the ere&amp;ion of other refineries in close contaft with the markets to be served, the building of a great fleet of tankers, the elaboration of an immense system of distribution. In 1915, by the establishment of the British Tanker Company, a Start was made towards the acquisition of a fleet. This was renderednecessary by the extremely high freight rates current at that period, rates which were four and five times the aftual running coSt of the vessels. Seven vessels were contra&amp;ed for at this time. By the acquisition of the Petro leum Steamship Company two years later, nine vessels were added to the fleet, which then comprised over thirty ships with a total dead-weight capacity of 205,415 tons. The tanker fleet has been largely augmented from year to year and to-day consists of more than sixty ships, of a total capacity of over 500,000 tons. This fleet is almost entirely composed of new vessels of large tonnage, combining in them all the improvements in the marine transportation of oil suggested by the skill and experience of the . builders of this type of boat. The combined fleets of the Company, including cargo-boats, river and coaStal craft, now total 263 vessels of all descriptions. The tankers are engaged exclusively in the Company’s work, carrying crude oil from Persia to the British refineries, and finished produffs from Abadan and the other refining centres to their various destinations in the markets of the world. They perform the same office as a pipe-line does on land, and ^the fleet has indeed been described as the Company’s “ floating pipe-line.” In this connefiion, it may be Stated that its capacity is affually equal to that of a 10-inch pipe-line Stretched around the globe. The remainder of the Company’s fleet is chiefly employed in port, river, and coaStal work in the Persian Gulf, on the Rivers Tigris, Euphrates, and karun, and elsewhere—carrying plant and Stores to the Company’sjwaeni 23 fields and refineries, finished produ&amp;s to the Company’s selling depots, and in other transportation of an essential character. @) With the enormous expansion made necessary during the War in order to meet military and naval requirements, and its produ&amp;ion of crude oil and its refining capacity constantly augmenting, it was clear that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company muSt develop a proportionate marketing organisation or see a large part of the profit from its business go into the hands of middlemen.' The familiar adage “ in time of peace prepare for war ” is equally true and applicable when reversed to “ in time of war prepare for peace.” The Dire&amp;ors of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, even in the A bird’s-eje view of the great Tanf Farm at Llandanj Stress of war activities, did not lose sight of the necessity of making some preparation for the changed conditions which peace would usher in - ln this they were favoured by a remarkable piece of good fortune. The British Petroleum Company, a marketing organisation operating in this country, the whole of the personnel of which was British, was early in the War confiscated as enemy property because it was found that it was controlled by a German firm known as the E.P.U. (European letroleuin Union) and that the whole of its shares were registered in the name ot the Deutsche Bank. With this Company were grouped two other ostensibly British Companies, viz. the Homelight Oil Co. and the Petroleum Steams up Co. These three concerns owed their origin to the efforts of certain Russian and Continental groups to find a foothold in the British market or petroleum produ&amp;s in competition with the American interests which formerly dominated it.Vipe-lines between l^landarcy and Swansea Dockj Water-tank^ and Observation Tower at Tlandarcy A group of Spirit Washers Taking advantage of so signal an oppor tunity, the Anglo-Persian Board purchased these three concerns from the Public Trustee, and so at one Stroke became possessed of a distributing organisation for the marketing of petroleum produ&amp;s in the British Isles, with its numerous installations, its well-trained and experienced Stall, its fleet of tank-cars and tank-wagons, and all the equipment necessary for the con- du&lt;T of nation-wide distributing a&amp;ivities. As the marketing side in this country of a company so large as the Anglo-Persian, with its constantly increasing output of petroleum produ&amp;s of the highest grade, the British Petroleum Company has undergone a remark able development. It now controls thirteen main installations adjacent to ports, 473 spirit depots, of which 177 are equipped with can- filling facilities, and 435 depots for handling kerosene and other products. Radiating from these, its tank-wagons and lorries, painted in the familiar green and red, carry the supplies of “BP” Motor Spirit and of Kerosene into every corner of the Kingdom. * * The Anglo- Persian Oil ./ v Compan a&amp;ivities Oils Lirr producir well-eSta through of the S addition In tl of free forget th Young a ment of vastly gr the wini The all subse exploitec day.

This gave to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a well-eStablished and highly efficient marketing organisation in Scotland, through which “BP” produ&amp;s are handled side by side with those of the Scottish shale companies. It also constituted an important addition to its refining capacity in Great Britain. In the extraordinary development following on the exploitation of free petroleum by drilling in the United States one is apt to forget that the true fathers of the modern oil industry were Dr. James Young and his associates. By their successes in the recovery and treat ment of Scottish shale-oil, they became in effea: the pioneers of those vastly greater a&amp;ivities which have ensued in the reSt of the world in the winning and refining of free petroleum. The methods they discovered were the foundation on which all subsequent development has been based. The shale mines they exploited and the refineries they erefted are in aftive operation to this day. Thus has the old est British oil industry joined hands w i t h i t h e newest. 3H V V N Lamp Oil and Spirit Lankj at the “ BP ” Installation, Hackney Wick / With the acquisition of these two marketing companies and the later establishment of others on the Continent—in France, in Belgium, in Denmark, in Norway, in Italy—came the need for a Still further increase of refining capacity. The Anglo-Persian met it by a decision which might be described as revolutionary, if it were not so obviously a matter of common sense. Heretofore, the pra&amp;ice has mainly been to ere£t refineries as near as possible to the source of produ&amp;ion, although this is by no means the general rule, and exceptions are found in Mexico, Peru, and many fields in the United States. In cases where the source of production is situated close to large consuming mar kets, this procedure is no doubt ■ wise, but, in the case of the ^ Anglo-Persian, to have placed LPainting cans with pittol spray Automatic Fillers in operation, piling 5 o-gallon drums and tno-gallon cans with motor spirit keting companies and the nt—in France, in Belgium, he need for a Still further ^rsian met it by a decision if it were not so obviously i to ereft refineries as near lough this is by no means in Mexico, Peru, and many :he source of production is ;e to large consuming mar- lis procedure is no doubt but, in the case of the iglo-Persian,to have placed Uing cans at Hackney Wick. Delivery Lorries at a “ BP ” Insiallation n, Hackney Wick the whole of its refining capacity in the neighbourhood of its.Persian wells would have been folly in the extreme. The Anglo-Persian Board, therefore, decided to limit its refinery capacity in the Persian Gulf to the quantity of products which it could see its way to marketing economically from that base, and to ereCt its further refineries in the countries in which crude oil can be refined with greater advantage than can be obtained by importing the resultant produCfs. In 1919 the first Step in this direftion was taken by beginning the construction of a great modern refinery at Llandarcy, near Swansea, South Wales. Two years later, in July 1921, aCtive refining operations were begun, and in June 1922 the refinery was formally opened. The results which have been obtained at this refinery more than justify the policy of the Board in the departure they made from the praCtice followed by others. There is no occasion here to go in detail into the advantages which are gained, but among others may be mentioned (1) greater ability to meet the changing needs of the market; Pump-house at Hackney WickFilling Farr els with Lamp Oil at Pur fleet c / efl'* * Y ? ■ ^ Filling Kail Fanfl-wagons at Anger Hein Wharf (Ojreenwich) Motor Spirit Tanks at Files mere Port (2) smaller loss by evaporation of the more volatile (i.e. more _ r __ valuable) portions of the pro- duds; (3) lower co£t of plant, chemicals and administration; and (4) more economic labour, allowing for the greater efficiency of the British artisan—in short, all the advantages which have led to this country importing pradically the whole of its raw materials and manufaduring them into finished produds, some of which are even profitably re-exported to the countries from which the raw materials were originally obtained. A second refinery is now nearing com pletion at Grangemouth for the supply of the Scottish market. This is a smaller Llandarcy and embodies the latest improvements in refinery Strudure and pradice gained in the treatment of Persian oils. It will have, when running at full capacity, a throughput of 250,000 tons of crude oil a year. A third refinery of a similar type with a capacity of 180,000 tons per annum has been ereded at Douai, in France, by the French Company which has undertaken the distribution of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s produds in that country.

The Anglo- Persian Oil Company is also conducing for the Australian Government geological researches into the oil possibilities of New Guinea. This partnership—more perhaps than anything else—emphasises the Imperial charafier of this all-British oil company. In addition to these enterprises, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, through its subsidiary, the D’Arcy Exploration Company—which is its prospering branch—has its scouts out all over the world where oil is likely to be found. In Hungary, in New Zealand, in the Argentine, in Borneo, r Candle-makjngat / ‘ Broxburn , ' Refinery30 r~ in Egypt, in Mesopotamia, in Palestine, in a dozen parts of Africa, in New foundland, in Trini dad, in Peru, in Venezuela, in Albania — everywhere they are or have been at work. They have taken the world as their field of research. Great as are the extent and potentialities of the Persian Oil Concession, it is the part of wisdom for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to be on the look out for helds in other parts of the world. The demand for oil is world-wide, and the huge amount of capital expenditure involved in the establishment of an organisa tion such as that of the Anglo- Persian renders it necessary that it should at all times be in as favourable a position as its com petitors in the matter of supplies.

The rapid increase in the use of this fuel, whether burned under boilers or more effectively consumed in internal-combustion engines, has effe&amp;ed a revolution in marine bunkering methods, which the Company has been swift to meet. Already the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has established more than forty main bunkering installations on the shores of the British Isles, at the principal Continental ports, as well as in the chief shipping centres of Asia, Africa and Australia. The number is continually being increased. Complete facilities have been provided at all these points to ensure adequate reserves of fuel-oil and rapid service in its delivery to ships. The installa tions are operated either dire&amp;ly by the Company or through its local distributing organisations and agents at the respe&amp;ive ports. * * * * For the people of Great Britain the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has opened up a new and incalculably rich supply of those petroleum produffs which have come to be a vital faffor of national progress and comfort and also of national safety. It has developed a new source of national wealth. It has brought freedom from the domination of foreign interests. With its independent sources of production and its complete and self-contained organisation, it is a Stabilising faffor in a market where prices are so often subjeff to violent fluctuations. The British motorist and the British business man are reaping the benefit of this moderating influence. To Persia, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has meant a new era of prosperity. The royalties it pays constitute the bulk of the national revenues. Still larger are the amounts spent in labour and supplies. To a large seCtion of the population it has given useful and profitable work and better Standards of living. It has established hospitals and schools. In a country where things move slowly and ancient tradition Still rigidly holds sway, it has already wrought great and beneficial changes. And it is only at the beginning of its work. Through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, modern industry has come to the ancient land where Daniel the Prophet lies buried and where his tomb Stands at Susa, not far from Maidan-i-Naftun, to this day. In Persia empires have risen and fallen, leaving only a tottering wall or a broken Statue to mark the place where their Strongholds and temples have Stood. The magic wand of modern industry caSts a spell far more potent and probably far more lasting than theirs. It has released from deep beneath the soil a flood which is bringing to Persia all the benefits of progress and civilisation.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of despatch No. 60 from His Majesty’s consul, Kermanshah. dated the 25th October, on the subject of Anglo-Persian Oil Company activities at Naft-i-Shah. Tehran, October 31, 1934. . l \&lt;0 Enclosure in No. 1 . Consul Summerhayes to Sir R. Hoare. (No. 60.) Si ri Kermanshah, October 25, 1934. I HAVE the honour to report that on the 23rd instant I travelled back here alone the new pipe-line of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from Naft-i-Shah, and I give below some account of the project in amplification of details given from time to time in diaries. 2. At Naft-i-Shah a sufficient volume of oil for all probable requirements is assured from the existing well with a depth of about 2,000 feet. r I wo other wells are being drilled close by, of which one is wanted as subsidiary for the mam supply and the other is needed for taking back the unnecessary crude oil. As there is no market in Persia for the heaviest oil products, the first distilling or topping is to be done at Naft-i-Shah before the oil is pumped up the line and the rough fuel oil will be pumped back down the third well. 3 . The work there is still mainly controlled from the Naft-Khaneh field, 4 miles away across the Iraqi frontier. Though the Persians have recently com plicated this control by insisting on the cutting of the previous telephone line between Naft-Khaneh and Naft-i-Shah, the new work is given some special facilities, and the Persian police and customs officials, both at Naft-i-Shah and at Khosrovi, on the main road, cause much less difficulty than they do in other places where the company works. When the construction work at Naft-i-Shah is finished the traffic between the two fields may be more restricted. 4. The frontier between Naft-Khaneh and Naft-i-Shah is fortunately well marked by the stream x\b-i-Naft, yet two of the wells on the Iraqi side are so close to this stream that it is planned to drill others at a comfortable distance. Further to the north, on its way towards Qasr-i-Shirin, the pipe runs very near to a less clearly defined frontier and after the first road had been roughly made for the work it was found that it touched Iraqi territory and a change had to be made. 5. Naft-i-Shah is the property of the Shah, and he is. of course, particularly interested in the project. The attitude of the authorities has, therefore, been generally helpful all along the line, and, between this and the care shown by the •company’s staff, the work has gone smoothly and quickly. His Majesty acquired some years ago all the area around the Naft-i-Shah, where the Kalher tribe, since renamed the Bavandpur, used to spend the cold seasons only. It is a barren district, but it is planned to make quite a township at Naft-i-Shah and to make the tribespeople settle there and over the now deserted country to Qasr-i-Shirin. 6 . The pumping station at Naft-i-Shah will boost the oil along the 3-inch pipe to the next pump near Qasr-i-Shirin, a distance of over 40 miles. The trench is ready there and the welding work is being hurried on now before the winter from the well end to meet at Pai-Taq the pipe, which is now finished, from there to Kermanshah. [265 t—5]7. A very rough road has been made along this undulating country from the wells to join the main road at Qasr-i-Shirin. Whatever the Persian authorities might like, it is not intended to maintain this road to Qasr-i-Shirin when once the pipe-work is finished, for inspection work ought to be possible on horseback. An iron girder bridge is, however, being constructed over the stream at Tangab, a tributary of the Elwand Chai, at a point about 13 miles south of ‘ Qasr-i-Shirin. 8 . Between Qasr-i-Shirin and Zehab the pipe, with its special telephone line, is brought near to the main road, which it follows pretty closely all the way from there to Kermanshah. The third pumping station is under construction on the lower slopes of the Pai-Taq Pass, and the fourth and last is also nearing com pletion about 2 miles west of Shahabad. At the top of the Pai-Taq Pass, 5,500 feet, the pipe will be at its highest point. None of the pumping stations along the line are close to any towns. These stations and the pipe are expected to be completed this winter, but the refinery at Kermanshah will not be opened till next June. 9. Along the main road I saw, as is now usual, very few lorries carrying anything but petrol up-country, and those in the opposite direction were nearly all empty. Unless general trade improves and the policy of starving this road is abandoned, it is likely to be very empty when the pipe-line starts working and, if the company distributes from Kermanshah in bulk to tanks at all important centres in northern Persia, the important transport trade at Kermanshah will be very seriously affected. As an offset, only a small number of local employees will be needed when the refinery here is organised, and much money will not be spent here. People in this area are, however, being usefully reminded again of the efficiency of British men and material. 10. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad.
