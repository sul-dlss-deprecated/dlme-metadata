Nc. 184 - S. PtRSlAK GULF iiESlDEKCY, BAHRAIN, the 1st February, 1947. Please refer to Dixon's deml official letter No. F•67(2)-BPG/46 y dated the 14th January, 1947. 2. The Sultan's retention of Gwadur is somewhat of an anachronism and from the purely practical point of view there is much to be said in favour of its retrocession by sale to lialat. 3. On the other hand a monarch like the Sultan usually clings to every inch of his territory, and, with Prior (cf. paragraph 2 of his demi official letter To* C/484, dated the 26th September, 1939, to Caroe), I find it difficult to believe that he would seriously consider disposing of Gwadur. However, as he made the suggestion himself in 1939 ostensibly for the purpose of raising funds it should be possible to ask him whether he wishes it taken up again now that the war is over. t 4 # I presume that if the Government of India decide to pursue the matter they will consult His Majesty's Government before asking me to take action.

After further considering this metter, we have come to the conclusion that it would not be desirable to engage now on negotiations of which there appears little hope of a successful issue within the limited time which the Prime Minister's declaration of February the 20th, 1947 leaves us. The Government of India do not therefore intend to pursue this proposal. ^ To The Kon'ble Lt.-Col. fl.F.

The file relates to the possible transfer of jurisdiction over Gwadar (which appears throughout in the form 'Gwadur') to Kalat State. The file includes a letter from Colonel Poulton, Ziarat, to Hugh Weightman, Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi, dated 18 September 1946, summarising the reasons in favour of the cession of Gwadar to Kalat. A further letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant Colonel William Rupert Hay), Bahrain, to Weightman, dated 1 February 1947, while stating that the retention by the Sultan of Muscat (Said bin Taimur) of Gwadar was 'somewhat of an anachronism', contains a warning that the Sultan was the sort of monarch who ‘usually clings to every inch of his territory’, and so would, in the opinion of the Resident, be unlikely to consider disposing of Gwadar, unless the Sultan’s own proposal of 1939 were to be revived and he were to be offered funds in return. The file also contains a response to this letter from the Government of India dated 18 April 1947, stating that the Government had no intention of engaging in negotiations on matters on which there seemed little prospect of a successful outcome within the limited time of [the granting of self-government to India] of 20 February 1947.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Gwādar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000162#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
