Para 197 of Kuwait Intelli gence Summary No .12 of 1949 refers. 3. The two Sheikhs who went to Iran were Fahad as Salim and Subah as Salim. They are the younger brothers of Sheikh Abdulla Salim, cousin of the Ruler and Head of the Finance Department, who deputizes for the Ruler in his absence. 4. Fahad as Salim was until 1944 himself in charge of the Finance Department 5 but was removed from the post by the Ruler for peculation. He has been unemployed since. His younger brother Subah is still employed in the Police; but both are looked at askance by the Ruler. Fahad as Salim visited Meshed and Tehran where he called at the British Embassy and also at the Indian Embassy. He is also reported to have given an interview to the Press. It would be not unlike him to describe himself as Minister of Finance - as reported in Tehran letter No.29/50/49 of the 26th July, 1949 but he was certainly not authorized to transact any business on behalf of the Kuwait Government.

In your letter No. fi.11017/6^69/34 of the 31st August 1948 you asked us whether there was any chan&lt; of making it possible for Cdl Company people to come to Persia on leave without excessive formalities in the way of passports, and we replied in our letter No. 26/6/3/4 of the 14th September that we saw no alternative to the prevailing system of issuing separate passports for travel to Persia. Mr. Shafiq’s latest offer, which is the result of epresentations made to him in K u wait (presumably by the Oil ompany and not by the Political Agent) provides an answer to your question of last year. It would appear that there is a divergence of view between the Oil Compaq? and the Political suggested by idr. Shafiq. Perhaps this could be cleared up in Kuwait? We appreciate, however, the force of Kuwaiti point about Iranian Airways' permission to operate in Kuwait and it is relevant in this connection that the Civil Air Attach*, on a visit which has Just concluded, told Mr. Ghulam Husain IbtihaJ, head of Iranian Airways, that the Sheikh had now agreed that Kuwait should be regarded as British territory for civil • aviation purposes and that in consequence Iranian Airways would have to apply to the British authorities for permission to operate their service. Mr. IbtihaJ seemed to accept this. We shall be glad to know as soon as possible how we are to reply to Mr. Shafiq. We are sending copies of this letter to the Political Resident in the Persian u^lf and to the Political nemdeiit in it. Kuwait do not appear to be aware of the correspondence which Agent, since the latter, as quoted in Bahrein telegrau No. 351 of July 26th, seems unwilling to encourage the arrangements Kuwait.

From point o{ view of this post I see difficulty in persuading Iranian Government to apply to His Majesty’s Government for permission for Iranian Airways to fly into Kuwait. Director General of Civil aviation has informed Air Attache that no Government department would undertake to apely for such permission. If this is correct we should then be ? fa cel with two undesirable alternatives (a) to allow service to continue with consequent loss of face (b) to present operation of service (presumably by refusing r fuelling etc., facilities or ? inpouni- ln ‘ aircraft). Such prevention ? might well w-rec: strong bilateral-agreement and endanger B.0.A.;»s position here..3. In the circunst: rices I sugrest Political Agent should inform Iranian Airways representative that he has eonsulWJ His Majesty’s Government, who are responsible f r 3hei.ch f s international relations in 3ivil Aviation fieli, and that ? they had no ob.ject - _ipn.. Jopies of corres tonlence should be sent here for transmission io Ministry of foreign Affairs.

If so tacit acquiescence by us in continuation of service would be much less open go objection than 2(a) above. In any case approach to Political ^yent is a g o 1 sign. /e could follovv up by trying to ma ce Iranians inclu le iurait route in routes to be specified under agreement. 5.

Your letter 26/137/49 of the 16th August, 1949, concern ing :iddle East Airlines proposed operations to Kuwait. Since the Lebanese authorities signed the convention on International Civil Aviation at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944, but, (as far as I am aware), have not yet ratified their adherence to it, our attitude to their requests for flights into British territory, including territories in the Persian Gulf which may be regarded as British territories for the purposes of aviation by virtue of our Civil Air agreements with their respective Shaikhs, may be governed by the following considerations. 2 . Non-scheduled non-traffic flights: Under Article 6 of the Chicago Convention, each contracting State agrees that all aircraft of the other contracting States, being aircraft not engaged in scheduled international air ser vices, shall have the right, subject to the observance of the terms of the Convention, to make flights into or intransit non stop across its territory, and to make steps for non-traffic purposes without the necessity of obtaining prior permission, and subject to the right of the State flown over to require landing. In the light of Ministry of Civil Aviation policy regarding non-scheduled non-traffic flights to the Persian Gulf, I see no objection to Lebanese aircraft being allowed to make such flights in accordance with the above provisions of Articles 6 of the Convention, without prior notification unless night stop or refuelling. 3• Non-scheduled flight s for commercial purposes • Article 6 of the Convention further provided that such aircraft, if engaged in the carriage of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire on other than scheduled inter national air services, shall also, subject to the provisions of Article 7 of the Convention, have the privilege of taking on or discharging passengers cargo or mail, subject to the right of any State where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable (Under Article 7, which deals with cabotage, each contracting State has the right to refuse permission to the aircraft of the other contracting States to take on in its territory passengers, mail or cargo for remuneration or hire and destined for another point within its territory. Embarkation of passengers at Kuwait destined for Bahrain would amount to cabotage). In the case therefore of Lebanese aircraft wishing to make such non-scheduled flights to the Persian Gulf for commercial purposes, we should for the present require prior permission to b obtained through the diplomatic channel. This would normally amount to notification of the flight, with reasonable details, being given in sufficient time to allow the appropriate authoriti to signify any objection, In the absence of any Lebanese Diplo matic or Consular mission in Kuwait, the Lebanese authorities may be prepared to delegate the local agent of the airline concer as the party responsible for seeking permission for these flights from the Political Agent,r^ 4 • 2 • 4. Scheduled Services. The above considerations are not applicable to scheduled flights, which should be the subject of an Air Services Transport Agreement between the States concerned, or where appropriate, a temporary operating licence. 5. We must however attempt to determine what constitutes a non-scheduled flights. I am not aware of any Internationally accepted definition of the term M non-scheduled flight', but in Section 23 of the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, the expression n 'scheduled Journey' means 'one of a series of journeys which are undertaken between the same two places and which together amount to a systematic service operated in such a manner that the benefits thereof are available to members of the public from time to time seeking to take advantage of it'. It seems reasonable therefore, to regard any series of flights as non-scheduled until they qualify for classlflcatlonas scheduled journeys according to the above definition. It may neverthless be difficult in some instances to know where to draw the line. 6 . The journeys which the Middle East Airlines have, according to my information, made recently to Kuwait will almost certainly fall intlally into the category of non-scheduled flights for commercial purposes, but show every likelihood of qualifying early for consideration as scheduled services. The Pan American Airways weekly freight service to Kuwait, made as an un-adver- tlsed stop on their round-the-world service through Basrah and the Swissair service advertised in the enclosed leaflet cannot reasonably be regarded as non-scheduled flights within the meaning of Chicago Article 6 . 7. In cases where the Kuwait Oil Company charter Lebanese or any other aircraft to carry to Kuwait their own personnel or supplies, we could give blanket permission on a monthly or perhaps three monthly bails provided that the operators of the aircraft undertook not to seek traffic from other sources on fli ghts thus authorised. This arrangement works well for Skyways Ltd., and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company aircraft in their daily visits to Basra to pick up Company's supplies and personnel. Local arrangements have been made so that the Iraqis require no notification other than an R/T message from the aircraft when airborne, to flying control, in reasonable time before arrival. Such arrangements would however be dependant upon the Lebanese being prepared to accept them on a basis of reciprocity, the principle being that British and Lebanese carriers have equal commercial opportunity to seek contracts from the Cil Companies without being faced with restrictions on the number of Journeys which they may make over a given period of time between the two territories. 8 . In view of the vegetable traffic between the Lebanon and Kuwait and of the activities of such non-scheduled operators as Bosworth, I should welcome an early opportunity of discussing arrangements with the Lebanese authorities, and shall raise this question with the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Civil Aviation during my visit to London in the first week of September \Information for passengers travelling by Swissair from the Persian Gulf to London.
